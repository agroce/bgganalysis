RATING: 6.5
All the elements of a game I love- the deck building, card drafting, worker placement, hand management. Plus a neat little theme and the two-sided cards. Why on Earth did I rate this so low? Definitely need a re-run of this one so I can upgrade it.

Finally got a play in with three players.  Good game, but a steep learning curve, which makes the game play a bit slow the first time.  Need to play this one again soon.

RATING: 5
The geometric permutations in turn choices and future planning that occur with cards lending strength is a *fantastic* feature and I would argue the central masterpiece of the game. Since you'll only see a fraction of the cards in any given game, game engines are rarely even close to being the same which is really nice. Great game at 1 and 2 players, 3 is good as well (4 drags, and 5 is a death sentence in terms of game speed, even the rule book sort of warns against it). The mental oompf required to handle the limited/governed engine building and the resource management lends itself to players occasionally developing a dire case of the "so smarts" (where you "were thinking you were so smart that you were going to do XYZ only to miscalculate what you actually needed"). 

The two greatest dings I have against it stem from time and cards. This is a game of "who can get the best combo engine going fastest and then ride that super-hard." That the game takes way longer than you expect it to, and I've seen 3p games run as much as 2.5 hours at the top end... Second, if everyone doesn't stay together, the last third/quarter of the game is a waste (and it should be called) which is rather anti-climactic, especially if someone goofs or it's taking a long time to run through. In some ways, I'd almost just concede if there was some form of honor in that, and I think this is why you don't seen engine-building games that let you run the engine for a long time because you just build the gap in terms of positioning. Sort of an oddity, it's possible (but I would argue not probable) to ignore the extra characters in terms of acquiring them and still get to victory. I keep tinkering with that, but find the longitudinal planning of what you want your engine to be early enough in the game to take advantage of it exceedingly difficult (especially with card wiping and new cards coming out). A minor ding might be that it's only interactive in terms of the resource draft (which is most needed and manageable at 2p, above that and it's sort of negligible and turns into a multi-player solitaire game of sorts). In general, a 4 or 5, occasionally hitting 6, but not as a rule of thumb.

[b]Read the full review [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1608929/exploring-louisiana-purchase-cutthroat-style]here[/url].[/b]

Lewis and Clark is an interesting Euro game because it's not like anything else out there. The race mechanic along the edge of the board is punishing and engaging, and there are many different ways to skin the cat. 

Lewis and Clark is built on three main pieces: hand management, worker placement on the game board, and dragging your exploratory camp farther and farther upriver, until you finally reach the long-hoped-for Pacific Ocean. 

Generally I don't like AP-prone, solitaire type games, but Lewis and Clark is an exception to that rule, and I also ended up enjoying it solo. I was surprised at what a slick system it is. Alexander Mckenzie makes for a great opponent -- he moves along so steadily that it really adds tension to every single one of your moves. I already enjoy the puzzle-like aspect of Lewis and Clark, so that was a fantastic addition to a game I already enjoyed. 

Playing solo, there's less pressure for character cards and spaces on the board, which I kind of enjoyed but also kind of wished for the interaction of the regular game. I can already see at player counts the huge importance of the on-board action slots, as they don't cost you time at encampment -- but may cost you Indians! I can see how this game would be brutal at four or five players. 

Overall, Lewis and Clark is an interesting game, but I think a bit too brain-burner for my tastes. Everything takes so much thought that you will take forever to play your cards. And with three or four players, that can make for a long, long game. Don't get me wrong, Lewis and Clark is fun -- but I'm just not sure I'd still pick it over other, better midweight games in my collection like [thing=96913][/thing] or [thing=157354][/thing].

I really wanted to love this game so much. So artistically pleasing, and i love reading about what each card does, and the person behind the card. But has some weird mechanics, and it becomes foreseeable who is going to win and there's nothing you can do to stop him..

RATING: 6.5
One of the reasons why Lewis and Clark is on this list is because it brings friends to the table that would otherwise not be too interested in board games. The theme goes a tremendous way towards elevating the mechanics and even introducing some elements that twist the genre of worker placement a little bit.

While the race aspect can have a win/lose feel to it, there are some definite photo finishes that take place which makes the game feel very tight. The hand-building is a fun way of fine-tuning your crew as you race to avoid the trappings of lost time on your way down the trail. It can be very difficult to decide which actions to take, though, and whether or not building the engine that can take you to the end will actually slow you down in the long run. It's a game that is much heavier than it would seem at first glance, if only because the decisions are tough and there is a bit of a struggle to know what the best decision may be at any given time. 

Lewis and Clark is a very well-crafted game with a unique puzzly feeling. At times it can feel like the game is too overstuffed with ideas to make upgrading your crew viable, especially when you're tasked with racing your opponents. After several plays, though, you'll start to understand the feeling of the game and take risks that may end up paying off later. I really enjoy Lewis and Clark for the different experience it provides, despite the slightly unwieldy feeling it offers.

RATING: 6
2 plays / 4, 5 players

LIKE: Lots of forward thinking decisions, with an engine-building mix of cards and worker placements. The "Indians" use is interesting how that resource is shared and used for worker placement, and it creates an interesting timing dynamic. Great artwork.

DISLIKE: My major complaint is downtime between turns. The game can be brain-burning on a first play, which slows some players. Planning card purchases was chaotic since cards would move off the board quickly. Playing with 5 people took 4 hours with tremendous downtime, so I don't recommend it.

OVERALL: A good game, but I wasn't blown away by it because I had played Rococo and Concordia before this, which both use a similar card mechanism, and I enjoy those more. The player interaction is ok, and for a few turns I didn't feel any interaction at all. Collecting the Indians in the pow-wow was very interesting if well-timed. I'm rating this average (6) for the downtime, but over time I could see this getting better when strategies start to emerge.

RATING: 8
Very beautiful, but also well designed. It's indeed a thematic race to the Pacific, but the run is tight. The rules are intriguing and unique (at least to me) in that you spend a card to play a card (most commonly) - and you gain additional benefits based off the cards of your opponents. It is't a fast game, but it is very smooth in execution and decisions. Love it quite a bit and want to 'explore' it more.

Juegaco de hacer una carrera con gestion de recursos, acciones por cartas combinadas y pequeño Deck building, combos, con las cartas por una parte con numero de acciones y otra con tipo de acciones. Mecánicas muy bien engranadas y tiene bastante interacción. Escala muy bien, pero a 5 demasiado largo. Y no tolera errores, es durete :)
Uno de los mejores juegos de los últimos años. Quizas como defecto, peca de rejugabilidad, si se juega mucho quizás el conseguir combinar ciertos combos marca demasiada diferencia.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

Lewis & Clark is a solid game mechanically, but has a few elements that clash with my gaming preferences.  First, the game is very tense... mostly.  I'm not quite sure what causes it, maybe the feeling it gives of being a race, but this game felt very tense, even to the point of being stressful.  I think the tension also comes from loss aversion.  In this game, you are going to make progress with your scout, but you will almost certainly lose some of that progress when you camp.  If you have a strong feeling of loss aversion (you hate to lose progress you worked hard to make), this game might not be for you.

While the early and mid game is tense, unfortunately the end game is not.  In the last few rounds, once I had settled on my plan to finish, there was no tension as there was nothing I could do to push things further.  I knew when I would finish, and I just had to hope that no one could finish before then.  This led to my second concern about the game.

This game is just asking for analysis paralysis.  There is so much forethought and planning required for this game that it becomes easy to go into mental lockdown trying to figure out the most efficient plan.  And even once you have a plan in place, your opponents' actions can cause your plan to go completely out the window, leaving you to grind your mental gears over a new plan.  The thinking required in this game makes the game play much longer than it could with less forward planning required.  This may not be a concern to everyone, but it is a concern to some.

Finally, for me, the way the theme was applied to the game was a bit of a turn off.  In the game, you can gain Native Americans to your party and then spend them for actions in a Native American village.  This made me uneasy as it felt like I was taking advantage of the Native Americans, using them up and then disposing of them, much as Europeans and white Americans have done for centuries.  I was fine with the ability to recruit Native American cards into your hand because you can do the same with white frontiersmen and it feels like the Native Americans are equals, but using Native Americans as a resource felt dirty to me.

A quick note on components: the copy I played was apparently a second printing, which was cheaper than the first, and it showed.  The resources didn't have stickers and were instead plain wooden pieces, which is something I'm used to from many Euro games.  The card thickness was a bit less from what I understand, which is fine since the cards don't get shuffled much and can easily be sleeved.  The biggest component issue was the lack of any kind of player aid in this version.  This game really could use a player aid to spell out a player's options for their turn, which I believe the first printing had but was missing from the second.

In the end, I feel like L&C is probably a good game and I can see the appeal it holds for many people, but it's just not one that appeals to me.

A game where you race up a river and over mountains. To move as fast as possible you need to manage resources carefully. There are a large number of character cards which many different abilities. Due to the random nature in which they are ordered at the start of the game, the game plays significantly different each time. Fun with great replayability

Like:
- some twist in the worker placement where the more you have is not always the better. 
- some diversity in the card drawn
- the way you have to use card

didn't like:
- long
- Hard to plan efficiently, which is strange in a worker placement game (but maybe it comes from the lack of experience)
- although cards are different i don't have the feeling that there is a huge "real" diversity

Will definitely try again sometimes

An engine building/worker placement/hand management/resource management/racing game.  (Other reviewers have added "puzzle" to the list too, and it feels puzzle-y, for sure, but it didn't really have a puzzle mechanic.)  Gorgeous art and lots of variation, but it's very much a planning game.  I'm not sure I can "get" the interplay without much repeated play.  All in all, a quite well-designed game, even if it didn't knock my socks off.

RATING: 8
+ Very cool theme; managing your hand, as well as not wanting to overstock your resources and workers makes this different than a lot of other worker placement/resource gathering games.
- It can be frustrating to not be able to make progress because the key cards get bought out from under your nose.


Why it's previously-owned:
This is a good game.  I would gladly play it with anyone who's interested, but it's never a game that I would choose off the shelf.
This got traded out as part of a large online trade.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I worked as the editor on the English rules. If you're playing Lewis&Clark in English, and something isn't clear in the rules, you know whom to blame!

Is it a hand management game? Yes, if you want to focus on that! Is it a worker placement game? Yes, if you want to focus on that! One of the most important strategic decisions that you'll have to make is this very thing: where should I focus my efforts? Generally, building up spiffy card combos is the way to go; but they're costly. They also tend to benefit your immediate neighbours as well as yourself. And the card combos might be terrific for getting you up river, but there are mountains ahead, which need very different resources...and after that there's more river!  Placing your Indian workers is easier, but there is no guarantee they'll come back to you.

Early on, as you're trying to build up resources and figuring out what characters you want to nab, it can be just a tad on the dry side. However, by mid-game, it becomes exceedingly tense, and only grows more so as the game progresses. You might still be building up your resources when you come to the horrified realization that your opponents are madly dashing ahead of you. Since it is a race game, it will be apparent when the end is imminent, and then there will be a sprint to the finish between the leading players; and it tends to be close between first and second! Can you easily recover from mistakes? Yes, if the mistake was made early on; late-game mistakes, however, are utterly disastrous!

M. Dutrait's art is simply magnificent. Each of the eighty-four cards is utterly unique, as are their abilities. The only exception to this is the starting hands: each player's hand has exactly the same abilities as the opponents', but every character is a separate character from the historical expedition. Most of the time, their abilities actually are related to the historical personage. 

It's incredible: Cédrick Chaboussit set out to create a game about a rural village in France in 1900, and re-themed it to the Lewis&Clark expedition, but the theme does not feel at all pasted on! I have no idea how he managed to pull this one off. Immersively themed? No. But well-themed (for a Euro), most definitely.

It's highly unlikely that you'll get through anywhere near a full deck during a game, so it has tremendous replayability; and special markers are included to alter the "course" lay-out, if you want to try something a tad different. The solitaire game is tremendously painful: you struggle to organize things to make great advances, while your fictitious opponent does nothing each turn BUT advance! And the solitaire version is tense from about the second or third turn!

At this early stage in my plays, I think 2 or 3 players might be best, with three the very best; but we'll see how things develop. UPDATE: Yep, three is the best and two is almost as good; and the solitaire version is almost as good as two-player!

Is the card play clever? Of course it's clever. Does the artistic theme and setting jump right out at you? Of course it does. Is the game original? Seems that way. What's not to love? It's not super fun. It's honestly a bit convoluted. And all the drama is building up to these massive almost game breaking swings of movement on the race track. Once someone's engine starts sputtering to life the strongest, other players have little of actual substance to do.

It's okay. I don't love it. I honestly just wish it was a co-op. I would rather explore North America with friends than competitors. The game dynamic is eh.

An unusual spin on resource management grafted into a race game. Gluttony is rewarded by inertia, and this is modeled in such a brilliantly simplistic manner. 

Only negative is this game can really punish players who aren't used to this kind of thinking, which makes it difficult to bring players of various experience to the table (well, without leaving a bad impression on the lesser experienced players).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Clever engine-builder with a unique end condition that scales very well from two to four players.  It's a bit long, but most people have figured it out quickly so game length is mostly dependent on AP.  I've noticed a lot of different strategies showing up, and players have noticeably improved after each game.

The scaling of the symbols means the game is probably most interesting with 3, as a few cards are way weaker with 2 than with 3/4/5.  Not played with 5, but I think it would be too long.  However, game plays perfectly well with 2p otherwise and collection doesn't feel broken.

Only real issue: card quality is very flimsy.  Sleeved with FFG sleeves, somewhat slippery (I prefer ultra pro but they were too thick) but don't bend too much and feel a bit heftier.  Significant improvement.

Lewis & Clark combines what I'm learning to call handbuilding (the central mechanic) with resource conversion and worker placement, so I should have loathed it.  However, what you do with the cards bears little resemblance to Dominion, all those mechanisms are really well integrated and it has reasonable fidelity to its theme.  For instance, every card represents an historical character and rather than collect prestige points, it's a sort of race along rivers and over mountains to Oregon. The one drawback is that playing time is quite long with a fair bit of down time.  I might try to limit future plays to no more than three players.

The artwork is lovely and production quality is good.

This game is my current obsession.  Very cool mix of worker placement and Dominion like deck building game embedded in a scoring system that uses a racing metaphor.

A highly thematic, beautiful looking game with an impressive "card combination" mechanic design, a plethora of cards and card effects to think about, that sadly, is just not my kind of game.  I don't particularly enjoy deck building, and thinking about card effects and card combinations, for hour after hour after hour.  And I don't want to play around with new and different cards in an available deck of cards to find a brilliant and perfect card combination (bragging rights?).  I guess no Magic addiction for me!  Oh well.

Nevertheless, I greatly respect this design for it definitely satisfies the designer's design goals.  He has done well. I just am not in the target audience.  One game of this was enough for me; no desire to play again, so I have to give it a 6.

This game is one of my "recent" favorites.  You are going on Lewis & Clarks expedition and must travel up the river.  Whoever can go the furthest up the river wins.  This has a deck building element to it, limited worker placement (meaning only one person can use a space,) and resource management.  Very fun tight game.  No games that I have played have been blowouts either.  Very well balanced.

6/4/16: I would not play this with 5 players, it would simply drag on too long.

It's a combination of worker placement and deck building to accomplish your goal of racing across the continent to be the first one to make camp at Fort Clatsop.  Like a lot of euros the first time you play you are simply trying to figure out what's going on and learning the cards.

Best with 3 or 4.

Racing game across the river to the Pacific. Quirky Indian mechanism that's both offensive and brilliant. 

Recommended for no other reason than stuffing your boats with Indians and then dumping them back on their sacred grounds for some other person to snag. PC? Hardly.

I really enjoy playing this game but it seems that the first dozen or so turns are simply people sandbagging resources and then making a final push at the end.  Since you can't go back any further than the end of the river and there are no consequences once you are there, people sit there collect resources and adventurers and then move later in the game.

Too cold, long, slow, mechanical and lacking in human interaction for my tastes. For something called a race game it was sadly lacking in adrenalin rushes, but then my judgment might be clouded by the fact that the last game I'd played before this was a rowdy beer-fuelled Cash $ Guns. 
Also, some of the internal logic of the game seems wonky. Why would a canoe take up space on one of your boats? Wouldn't it be paddling alongside? Then there's a card which logically allows you to convert an animal hide and a wood into a canoe, but another that allows you to convert one canoe into two canoes - how would that work?

RATING: 9
Very fulfilling game but due to number of turn options available, best played with 3 players maximum.  Severe AP possibilities with wrong players.  Initial impression was that this was a race game.  But the race is up the Saint Louis (score track) river, but this is more than a score track with the tricky river to mountains switches and the steps back for setting up camp arising from surplus natives, goods and cards.  There are subtle hand management possibilities if you get rid of your one value cards and clear ones as to whether to use your cards for the action or as an Indian(s).  The flexibility of being able to make camp and/or recruit before or after our compulsorily action is pleasing.  The artwork has character but I thought could be a little clearer.  The counter sticker images are a tad small and the brown card symbols front and back different shades.  Using bison for water movement was not intuitive, but these are minor niggles on what was an unexpected gem.  Congratulations to Cédrick Chaboussit and Ludonaute on a very impressive publication.

Nem rossz, de: Hiába a szép dedikált példány, az alapvetően tetszetős játék (jó fakkos doboz), és biztató szabály, nekem nem adott akkora élményt, hogy újabb játékért kiáltsak. Az egy dolog, hogy a feléig rosszul játszottuk, de ettől függetlenül se volt túl érdekes, izgalmas. Mostanában 2 dolog az ami miatt tetszeni szokott egy játék: ha nagyon eltalálják a tematikát, vagy ha nagyon jó a mechanizmus. Itt mindkettőből van egy kicsi, némi tematikát belevittek, és új ötletek is vannak a mechanikájában, de egyik se annyira ütős, hogy hanyatt essek tőle. Nekem túl monoton 3 órán át lépkedni a vízmezőkön, kicsit olyan, mintha 3 órás K2 partit nyomnánk, hát az is sok lenne.
Még egyszer mondom, nem rossz a játék, de csalóka a bgg helyezése, nem igazán értem, mit keres a top100-ban. Ha pozitív várakozás nélkül ülök le, talán jobban tetszik?!

Quite interesting, hard game, with a beautiful look.  The idea of getting resources and spend them in an optimal way to avoid getting a penalty works quite fine, and creates tense and complex game.
It is a bit above my level, but I think that with some more games I would get it quite well and enjoy even more than in my first game.
Anyway, I think it is much better played with 3 or 4, than 5, that makes a too long game.
The meeples and cards are all really nice looking, although the icons in the cards are not always as clear as desirable.  Anyway, they are public and can be explained to everybody, so it is not the worst situation.
Interesting, demanding and nice to look at, it deserves the great interest it has had.

Yes, the game features a combination of mechanics that render it intuition-resistant (meaning: innovative) even to experienced players. The art in the board and the cards is beautiful. However, I found it difficult to enjoy the game itself. Many of the mechanics boil down to the race element and the random appearance of some cards.

Great recipes are made with good ingredients, not new exotic ones. Lewis & Clarke is definitely a great game, even without showcasing new mechanics, but mixing known ones in a tight, exciting and, as a whole, innovative design.

The game is a race along a river (and few mountains) to reach the west coast. There's a bit of worker placement (with a twist: workers placed in the common board are "lost", and the first player using the retrieving action "steals" all of them), a bit of deck building (everybody starts with the same 6 cards, but the other 54 cards in the game are all unique!), a little resource management (and the fleet is quite small: accumulating resources can be quite painful), and definitely an aspect of tempo management.

As I already said, everything amalgamates in a tight, challenging game, that plays in a quite unique way.

Initial tentative rating is a 8.

Initial Impression: Wow! This is an amazing game. I was initially attracted to it by the wonderfully colorful artwork. The board, the cards,... it all looks so nice. The promise of a "deckbuilder" also attracted me. I was initially thrown off by the fact that your hand contains your entire deck from which to choose what to play. Acquiring cards allows for more powerful actions and the decisions to use a card either for its action or to power other actions is wonderful. The race aspect of the game ensures that the players have little time to tune their hands/tableaus. Efficiency will win the game. I'm looking forward to getting in more plays of this game.

RATING: 6.5
L&C is a card-based engine-building euro-game that ties card drafting into its game play and that ties its length to a victory point goal (reach a point on the board) instead of a set number of rounds. A player must make both tactical and strategic decisions on each turn. There is potential for interaction between players and there is a decent amount of variability between plays. That combination would normally result in a high rating from me; however, the pace of Lewis & Clark feels way too slow for what you get out of it. 

In the end, L&C pales in comparison to other games due to the mechanisms mixing together in a way that makes it difficult to pre-plan your turn. Each player is constantly reevaluating the board and strategy, up until the point when the transition to engine firing occurs. It should be noted that if a player fails to build their engine efficiently or fails to account for the pace at which the other players are moving, a player may not even reach the engine-firing phase of the game. If I want a tactical hand management game with card drafting, I'll play Concordia over this. If I want a deep strategy game with variability and some race aspects, I'll play Great Western Trail over this. If I want a card-based strategic euro game with resource management, I'll play Agricola over this. If I want an interactive euro with card drafting, I'll play Food Chain Magnate over this.  

The historical nature of Lewis & Clark is great. However, the production hides some of the thematic flavor in the rule book. The down time between turns in Lewis & Clark would be more acceptable if the flavor text for each character was on the card instead of the rule book (this would give you something to do while you wait). Passing around the rule book is a poor substitute.

The appealing mechanisms, decent solo variant and ability to modify the mountain/river track, bumps this to a 6.5 from about a 6. I'd never play this game with more than 3 players.

Did I just step in a bear trap and drag myself through 100+ turns of collecting and converting resources?  Normally I love resource conversion and worker placement.  However, the worker placement actions took a back seat in the canoe.  The main part of the game was converting furs/equipment into cards that would help move you down the river and over mountains.  It takes way too many turns to get the right mix of cards and to toss overboard the dead weight cards.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a blend of a whole lot of mechanics but it all works seamlessly together. I love that the victory point track is re-fashion into a 'race', makes it much more thematic but also my gripe. The sweet spot for the game will probably be 3 players, anymore than that and it'll be too long of a game and lesser than that will make it less tense. Components and artwork are really great as well for the game!

The gripe I have with it is there's nothing you can do to stop the winner if they're about to win. Usually Euro games do just fine with this cause there's a lot of end game scoring so you don't exactly know who's the winner when game ends. For Lewis and Clark, you know exactly who's going to win so it's just a matter of waiting for the person to end the game. Maybe repeated plays with experienced players will create a more tense finish!

First Play: Sublime production quality withy awesome figures/ meeples.  The rule set is simple and games start quickly. A need to keep an eye on the opponent's actions to take advantage of their resource cards and prevent them benefitting from yours. The facility to alter the terrain for future plays I can see extensive replayability.

Follow up games with 2 and 4 players. Four players was pushing it with large chunks of down time between mnoves. Five players to be avoided at all costs. Playing time with speed up with experienced players.

RATING: 10
Quickly became a favorite after just a few plays. Having to use cards from your hand to power up other card abilities is genius. I understand it's not alone in having this mechanic, but it is done so well. Each decision is met with a penalty, whether losing a card as a power up, or losing an Indian to the village, that you must account and plan for, and does make for some AP proneness. However, unlike AP prone games like Agricola and Five Tribes, every option is interesting, and sometimes exciting. But maybe the game's greatest asset isn't in it's mechanics, but in it's winning condition - be the first to the Pacific. Unlike victory-point salad games where you can only hope you're doing well enough to win, being able to focus on a single most-important goal, and being able to see exactly how you're doing against your opponents is just incredible. I've heard L&C compares to racing games, which is great because I was looking for a good racing game! And this just might be the best out there. The artwork is fantastic, as are the components. If I had one complaint it would be that the game board itself could have been of higher quality. I don't see it remaining in tip-top shape past a few setups, which is a bummer because L&C is going to see a lot of plays in my house. Awesome, awesome game.

Amazing game. The different selection of recruitable cards every game, multiple paths to victory, and multi-use cards give this game astounding replayability. Hand management, worker placement, and light deck building implemented perfectly. Theme and artwork very well executed. A real winner. Only potential detractor for some: it's punishing. You kind of have to tread very carefully. If you make a significant mistake, it can be near impossible to recover.

A great and beautiful game! Although I have only played it solo and on two I think three players is perfect. It is probably not very good with five  players because of the risk for AP. The deck building makes even the challenging solo games very different.

Lewis and Clark employs a hodgepodge of mechanics. You have worker placement, resource management, variable player power, quasi-deck building and a race game. Despite this jumble, the design works. The components are adequate and the art gorgeous. 

I was enthused on my first few plays of the game, but in my postweaning plays the game settled to mediocrity. That's not to say that the game is not innovative or enjoyable, but it could drag and be repetitive at times. Perhaps it's scaleability has something to do with it. I would consider that this scales the best at three since four or five can drag a bit especially with newcomers or AP prone players. 

All in all, a great design with a great theme and engaging gameplay.

Fantastic new mechanisms, but you can win ignoring some of them. For example the Indians: Wonderful, but it is only in the beginning necessary to take them. Also the tales. You can take none of them. Look for a good combination of 2 cards and run! 
In the beginning, I think, for beginners it is necessary to play those 3 moves: 1. Take 6 Wood. 2. Go with 3 indians to build 3 boats. 3. Go 12 steps with the card, that allows you to go 4 steps with 1 boat. 
Nevertheless thank you for a wonderful game. I will go advertising it, whenever I have the chance to. For example now. :-)

I love how each card is a real person, but have to refer to the rulebook to know more than the name. The iconography is so confusing and differs on each card, they each must be looked up every time a card appears on the table. Has neat mechanic where move man and then "solidify" progress only when stop taking turns similar to Concordia in where chose when to end your turn and pick up all your cards, but much more thinking necessary to optimize this decision while not slowing down your engine. The game is a little long and drags. If Oregon wasn't so damn far away (or movement was quicker), this might be better. I don't think they meant to make the long slog feel experiential!

// I have to admit what drew me to this game initially was
the art and design. The game play itself ended up being 
pretty solid - I like the aspect of racing west, not using
a victory point track as such, and the way this game 
implements hand management and card usage is pretty neat.
The game felt really cut-throat with 2 players, and that's

An unusual deck-building and "race" game.  Efficient play and timing are critical for both deck-building and resource collection/storage.  I'm not fond of the fact that the cards available for purchase are all unique and become available randomly (instead of having a layered/stacked deck with more powerful cards reserved for later rounds), but I may grow to like the game despite these minor quibbles.  Note to self: get a multipurpose card or two early and trash some of the starter cards ASAP.  The starters seem useful/necessary, but they really slow down your game.

Only just got to play this gem. It's clear why this game gets good ratings. It has all the makings of a classic. The mechanics are clean and simple, yet there are a ton of options from turn to turn. Low setup time, replayability is high and the art is amongst the best I've seen. A euro game where the theme actually comes through for a change.

Gameplay wise it requires a fair bit of brain churning. It's an exercise in optimisation and you have to plan well upfront. And while the planning seems euro-style solitaire it's every bit as important to gauge your opponents actions because failing to time your actions right can be the difference between getting ahead or falling behind. It can be quite unforgiving at times.

There is a bit of luck involved in when certain character cards become available, but overall it comes down to skill and knowing how to take advantage of the options provided. The 30 minutes per player stated on the box seem overly optimistic to me. Two hours for a three player game is more likely and if it's your first or second play I'd say even 50 minutes per player.

Edit: Bumped it to a 9. This one deserves it.

I dislike the transition from river to land travel and vice versa, because it's too game-deciding. The fact whether you manage to get the exact movement you need, will decide the game, because otherwise you'll effectively need to skip a turn. This forces some AP, because you can't afford to gamble at that point. The engine building apart from those key-points in the game is not as important as it seems. I also disliked how the placement of other players randomly punished/rewarded players sometimes with a huge impact.

It strikes a nice balance between letting you build the engine to your desires but yet still not completely opening it up into a sandbox game.  The game has a 5 card buy row, a penalty for hoarding to many resources and not playing all of your cards.  These confine you to keep your engine lean but at the same time don't slow it down too much.  My favorite thing about this game is the scoring track.  It is not only a race instead of just a tracker but it also makes your engine have to be capable of 2 separate types of movement, which creates an interesting puzzle.

Provisional rating, need more plays (might go down, might go up).

Wasn't expecting to like this at all - as it was described to me as a blend of the 'best' euro mechanics in a euro game ... and my tastes tend to thematic.

But it's great! Yes it's a euro but the theme makes sense and helps the game - and there is bags of reply with the cards and the terrain tokens supplied so you can alter the river if you really want.

Not as solo as it first appears, as you interact based on the cards your neighbours have played (like 7 wonders) and spots taken in the village (worker placement) and the cards you draft.

All in all a favourite for now. Could suffer from downtime, but at the moment I need the time to consider options so it doesn't feel long, even though it is.

Beautiful and unique engine building race game.  Dutrait's art makes the theme pop.  I really enjoy the mechanics and have no problem with the runaway leader aspect.  I get it, you want me to slow down and let you catch up, but your overfull boat is leaking and your guide is cross-eyed.  Sorry.

Unique card placement system, a lot of different choices to make every turn. Yet, lacks a little interaction between players. It's hard to play against each other - you play mostly for your own benefits. Also, it doesn't work well for 2 players game - final result relies mostly on cards that were available.

A small race to the Pacific coast! But if the indians would known, which new friends they got over a few months of this westward travelling group, they surley wouldn´t offer their help to Lewis & Clark and company. A very good deck buidling game in a nice french comic style for explorers.

Es un juego de carreras, realmente.. tienes que avanzar por el río hasta llegar al pacífico. Para hacerlo tiene que ir avanzando con tu explorador e ir asentando campamentos. El primero que asienta un campamento en la costa pacífica gana. 

Es muy sesudo por el uso que se hace de las cartas y los recursos. Cuando asientas un campamento un exceso de equipaje puede hacerte retroceder. 

Está muy bien. Entretenido y rompecabezas. :) Recomendable para jugones.

The challenge to have the camp progress toward the finish line, without allowing for too much delay in acquiring resources and help, is wonderfully presented in this race for the finish theme. The character cards  are very useful, offering advantages that are hard to pass, yet the deck can't get too overwhelming as it will slow the camp down. This tension is reminiscent of Dominion's kingdom decks - picking up good cards but then trying to discard down to size. Rich with historical characters and the Old West. I'm giving the game an initial 9, but feel it should be a 10 and will confirm with more play time. UPDATE: The play time is still long - can't seem to get it under 2 hours, so lowering the rating.

2014: This is a great game, but I can't get it too the table yet. It's a brainburner.

2016: This year I've played it several times solo and introduced experience games to it. It took several plays to understand how it all worked together, but now that I do understand it, I'm amazed. The sheer amount of possibilities--recruiting, strength, indian actions, movement types, boats, etc--almost startle my brain. The group I introduced it too couldn't stop analyzing the strategies and what to have done differently. Because of the recruiting cards, every game feels different even though you're always accomplishing one thing--moving up the river.  In addition, the theme is top notch.  We'll see if this awakening continues for Lewis and Clark.

Worker placement, race, deck building, 1-5 players; sounded good, at first. It seemed the designer had a mechanic and tried to force it on a theme. The cards have many interesting historical figures on them but you keep "buying" a new replacement to fit your current situation. The actual original 33 man crew remained fairly stable.

Spending Indians to accomplish almost anything in the game is hard to relate to L & C's historical diaries. 
M. R. Mongomery wrote one of best accounts IMHO: http://www.amazon.com/Jefferson-Gun-Men-West-Almost-Happened...

Hope this theme meets a fitting Mechanic someday.

RATING: 7
A very interesting, surprisingly difficult game that crippled me with AP more than usual. It is quite a challenge to puzzle out how to use your cards, Native Americans, and resources as efficiently as possible, with little to no waste. Add to this the fact that you always need to be thinking a couple of [i]rounds[/i] (not turns!) in advance, to see how far you will travel, how many spaces you will move back when camping, and what kinds of cards you'll need in future rounds to get through new terrain. Add to this the fact that you're constantly monitoring what cards your opponents have in their tableaux, trying to predict when they are going to camp, and deciding whether you want lots of goods or very few based on the number of symbols on the table... Suddenly you have a huge number of things to consider! Some of my turns were so long that my husband started to get frustrated, so I hope with future plays I'll be able to speed things up.

Great game.  Plenty of decisions to make and the character cards provide nice variability, but...

The quality of the game board leaves much to be desired. In fact, it's lousy.  It's  really thin and is showing considerably more wear and tear than other games I have played more frequently(Alien Frontiers).  It's very disappointing because otherwise I would have rated the game at least a 8.5.

1/19/15: Game is still very good,  but has a problem that there is not a good catch up/reel 'em back in mechanic to combat the runaway leader that often happens in game.  Having said that, I will play it anytime.

Lewis & Clark is a downright brilliant game. There is almost no randomness besides the card offer, and the difference each game in the offer is what makes it replayable and interesting.

If you like Euros and/or games with a good theme, this is a must buy.

RATING: 7
Lewis and Clark is a neat combination of worker placement and also some mild deck building that allows you to modify your capabilities throughout the game, that makes it feel pretty distinct from any other game I've played.

The scoring is also fairly unique, in that players are trying to advance up the river, setting up base camps to save their progress and reset their hands of cards, trying to be the first to set up the final base camp at the mouth of the river.  So, the scoring appears as a race between players, which is neat.  Everything you do in the game is with advancement in mind.

The game is very much a get stuff to turn into other stuff which allows you to do this other stuff sort of game.  It's very much about optimization; getting the right amount of this resource so I can do this other stuff.  Being off by just one can potentially set you back several turns against your competition, so you need to be rather precise about everything you do.

Overall, just a neat, rather fresh game that I look forward to playing more of!

Fue una gran sorpresa encontrar este juego en $50 en una tienda de objetos de segunda mano, siendo que este está completo y en excelentes condiciones :) Hace mucho no encontraba un juego que me gustara tanto. Me encanta esa incertidumbre de no saber qué hacer desde el principio de la partida pero que turno tras turno vas aprendiendo a jugar mejor. Es muy buena la mecánica de retrocedes si tienes muchos recursos almacenados. Siempre me han gustado los juegos con colocación de trabajadores. El manejo de cartas también me gusta pero este juego tiene la ventaja de no ser al azar como en 7 Wonders. De los juegos más estratégicos que he jugado, pero es que ese tipo juegos son los que siempre me han gustado más. Vas creando tu mano de cartas un poco al estilo Dominion pero de forma más lenta.

RATING: 6
The gameplay is a little too fiddly for me. Once again, there are lots of cards with different abilities (displayed with dizzying iconography) so card combos are important. And this setup (with lots of cards that don't all come out and where you have limited lookahead) has the inherent problem of hoping cards pop up that mesh with your cards/plans.

That said, there are a lot of good things going on in this game. I see some comments about it being solitaire and I very much disagree with this. It is critical to understand when your opponents are going to camp and  pow-wow, and the meat of the game is timing things to maximize your leeching from opponents and minimize their leeching of you. The double use of the cards leads to some very interesting and tense decisions and how to play your hand. It's a very innovative and fresh feeling game. And in today's marketplace, that is saying something.

I'm thinking 3 player might be best. The game has a per/player playing time, probably 40 minutes per player. Plus, there is the 7 Wonders issue, where it plays better to be in contact with all other players for card effects. And the board can get locked up with more players before pow-wows and it might free things up a bit. Would like to try again with 3. 

Update: raised to 7. Played a 5 player game in well less than 2 hours, so that is very encouraging. Length concerns seem unwarranted. Very interesting decisions and the package does feel fresh. I liked it a lot more the 2nd time.

Also, there is lots of historical information added to the game.

[thing=140620][/thing] is a game that rewards clever [b]hand management[/b], strategic [b]worker placement[/b], and efficient [b]hand/deck building[/b] (through [b]card drafting[/b]). A keen sense of timing is required to know the optimal moment when to perform and apply your actions. The seamless integration of these mechanics and the historic theme make this game a huge hit for me!

I get the same feeling as playing [thing=2651][/thing] (which is awesome!) but this one is richer and (for me) thematically superior. Instead of "racing" to be the person to power the most cities, you are racing upstream and over mountains to be the first to the Pacific Coast (Oregon I am guessing). In Power Grid you have to carefully plan each turn right from the very beginning to ensure that you have all the money required to execute your plans. In L&C all of your maneuvers are mainly controlled by your deck of cards. 

Everyone starts with the same deck, but this can be quickly modified by recruiting new characters to your expedition. I love this deck building aspect. The power of the cards you play can be influenced by what people have played around you (to get resources for example) and by how many natives you chose to help you, which essentially acts as a multiplier. This introduces a critical timing element into what you chose to do when. You cannot get too greedy or over zealous when building your deck because characters left over when you build camp work against you (your expedition is too big and unwieldy). 

The bacon strip wrapped around this filet is the worker placement component to this game. Mmmm mmmmm!

Like Power Grid, I did get the sense that once you fell behind it was extremely challenging to catch back up. I could keep pace, but never did I get the sense that I was going to get back in it. To help you out, Power Grid invokes the reverse turn order to give advantages to the people in the back. L&C has some pretty neat "catch-up" character cards that you could utilize to get you back in it.

Deck building, worker placement, resource conversion, leaching and more. There is a constant need to calculate resource requirements and to time your actions with precision to do well in the game, which might make some people dislike it.  Quite reminiscent of Concordia, but less elegant than that and thus, a slightly lesser game. 

Has a good mixture of strategy and tactics, and is quite the novel and clever design, plus no-one can deny the stellar components and artwork. Mind you, this needs at least 1-2 plays to get into the cadence of the game. A fine game.

So far I have played this two player and the oportunity to block your opponent are limited, consequently if your opponent gets ahead they can stay ahead.  The first few moves are therefore critical.

This is 'Are We There Yet? - the Board Game'. I know this is about a long and arduous trek across North America that required sacrifice and meticulous planning - but does it have to feel like it?
This was a total flop with my group - we gave up after the first mountain range, there was simply no excitement despite its central element supposedly being a race. Based on the high scores from others I can only surmise that this game really appeals to those more inclined towards the 'puzzle' elements of games - those who get real enjoyment from thinking through complex game engines to calculate and plan what they need to do for each of the next ten turns. To me it just feels too linear - while there are certainly different strategies it all boils down to moving a cardboard camp marker along an unhelpfully small journey track. There's just no sense of an epic journey unfolding - or perhaps there is something exciting happening but you've been employed to stay back in the office as the accountant...

So far, what stops this being great is the feeling that there is really only one way to play: keep a small hand and choose a simple engine based on the cards that show up. I've not yet played with everyone at the table doing this at once so perhaps it gets tighter with experience.

The card distribution will enable more plays despite this and I'm still enjoying it after 4 or 5, but I wonder if there'll be a point at which the games is 'done' for me.

This is not good game for multiplayer (especially for 5 players) but excellent solo experience (rating 9). The solo game is short (about an hour), the setup/reset of the game is very fast (less than 1 minute), the card draw makes each game sufficiently distinctive and you can spend as much time as you want to figure out the perfect turn. Multiplayer games feel chaotic in comparison: too much planning and analysis, which is invalidated by luck in crucial details, e.g. the scout being able to move one extra step in mountains due to ending its move on another scout.  On the plus side the game looks very good and has functional design.

I particularly stink at this game. It's difficult for me to execute a plan. I can't tell yet if that means my rating will go up or down with more play. But there's a lot to like for sure. Nice dual use of cards. Somewhat similar to Concordia in that you can get new cards, and you play them into a discard pile, but you can always choose to play any of your cards each turn, until you have to cycle your discard pile. I think I generally that sort of thing, even if I stink at it.

10 steps forward, 5 back. 4 steps forward, 6 back. 12 steps forward, loose half of 'em because the correct transport is not available. Switch production to another kind of resource so you can do the forward-backward thing in a different (but in fact arbitrary) region of track. Jump through hoops to make your cards produce two different transports at the same time, curse when you fall back. And still finish first. Despite this giving 'two steps forward and one step back' a whole new meaning, I had this nagging feeling that something felt familiar. It took me a while to work out what: Lewis & Clark is in fact a puzzle game not unlike some of the designs Stefan Feld cranked out of late. Players more or less do whatever they want, see each other only sparingly but are still able to influence each other's game state thusly. That is what Castles of Burgundy and its brethren do, too. But where Stefan attempts to give players something fresh to puzzle with, Cédrick limited himself to very standard aspects: shared worker placement, special action cards, resource conversion. Only the card activation mechanism is novel... but I'm not sure that that is sufficient to keep the game afloat over time. What most certainly [i]does[/i] help is that the game comes with material to alter the road the players take. This changes the way in which players should construct their card playing engines considerably, thus keeping matters fresh. 

Overall, my response to Lewis and Clark is rather 'meh'. It's not because the game doesn't function: in fact it plays perfectly fine. I am also not saying that it is easy to finish first, because I have this nagging suspicion that more experienced players will be over the Rockies before you have struck camp a few meager places beyond the starting location. There is definitely skill in playing efficiently here. But it just won't strike a chord with me... probably because of all the mundane mechanisms it employs. Your mileage may vary.

Oh, one important detail which ought to be mentioned: finally a box with little air inside once everything is stored away.

This game is a brilliant balancing act between achieving maximum efficiency on any given action against your capacity to manage those resources. It's a game of building a good engine, but not the best engine, because no matter how good it is, it can only get you so far. One of the best Essen 13 releases.

This was game #1 on my wish list.  There's nothing I do not like about this game.  The theme and mechanics go together and bees and honey.  Each character are actual people Lewis and Clark associated with on their expedition; and each of their abilities coincide with what they actually did in real life.

I do have to say I am not a huge fan of the one player version where the dummy player moves one spot/turn.  But it does make it a tight game to beat.

I like this game, but I'm afraid that Discoveries may have replaced it.  Time will tell.

I think the combined action choice / deck building mechanic is very interesting and has enormous potential! :) Which is why I was looking forward to trying out this game.

However, unfortunately I didn't find the details of the implementation particularly convincing... :(
I like complex games in general, but I think this one is too complex without gaining enough strategical depth from this complexity to be really worth it. Our 4 player game had very much downtime between turns.
I expect this would change with more games, but in order to get tolerable, I expect several games and study of the many different cards to be needed. For now, the game didn't really click enough for me that I feel like I really want to invest this time.
There are too many different action cards for my taste - 60 different ones and only one copy of each. I would prefer if instead of the 54 different encountered characters, there would be, say, six copies of 10 different ones. That would both reduce chaotic complexity and increase the possibilites for strategically planned card combos.
As is, the process of buying new characters seems too chaotic and luck based to me.
The characters also don't seem balanced enough. Some are just so much stronger than others (particularly #53, Sacagawea - but others are mighty strong as well) and I think this isn't by far balanced enough by the mere 2 difference in Equipment cost between a strength 1 and a strength 3 card (considering how easy you can get loads of resources even with the abilities of your starting characters after a few turns when there are lots of visible badges).
What really pushed the game over the top for me complexity-wise are the Shamanism action in the village and the character "The Partisan" (35) which also allows to copy opponent's characters (up to 3 times with strength 3). So you even have to consider what all of the opponent's characters would do for you most of the time!

My rating and this comment is based on only one game (with 4 players) without reading the rulebook myself, so you should definitely take it with a grain of salt.

I think it would be best to learn this game with two players or even in a solo game, so it probably wasn't ideal to first try it out with four.
And I guess in order to learn this game, you have to be willing to play several games in which you just wing many things and don't bother to even want to try to play anywhere near optimally - which is difficult for me! ;)

This was a great deal of fun, and seems to promise a fair amount of variation from game to game. I'm a real fan of the "slowly self-modifying no-random-draw hand" dynamic this game uses (one of my games currently in development does something similar), and there were enough points of interaction [racetrack, village actions, card drafting, resource generation] to keep it feeling like other players were relevant to my play experience.

There are some lovely pain-points in the route you're racing along - for instance, the first land travel is 7 mountains long, which is more than you can get past with most single card-plays. But if you're first to those mountains (stopping at the joint land/water space), the next player(s) to show up will end up on the space beyond... and you can get over 6 land spaces in a single action with many more cards, including one in your starting expedition! So there's real benefit to either not being first, or if you are first to racing a few spaces into the mountains right off the bat so other expeditions can't benefit from your scouting.

I also like that all of the character cards are apparently real people (or in one case, a real dog) involved in the Lewis & Clark saga. 

I've heard thirdhand mutterings of a card combo which turns the game mostly solitaire, which would be sad, but probably avoidable by just omitting one of them from the deck.

RATING: 9
This is definitely a classic.  It presents us with some of the main things we like in games.  First, there are the multi-use cards: each card is an ability, or a power for another card.  Using it as a power, though, takes it out of use for that round: you won't get it back until you camp.  This gives rise to a number of tough decisions, which interacts with the next thing we like: the market.

Like Concordia, L&C offers 5 cards for purchase at any given time.  Unlike Concordia, all of L&C's cards are unique.  So each game, each round, you are presented with a unique crop of characters to consider.  This gives another level of tough decisions, and the opportunity to "pivot" to a new strategy if someone interesting comes out.  

There's also the temptation to overdo it - to buy too many people and bloat your engine.  If you don't buy enough, though, you won't make much progress along the course.

All in all, this is a fantastic game.  Plus, amazing art from Vincent DuTrait!

This is a really good game. One of the best I have played this year. I would have given this game a 10 but the component quality is quite poor - low grade cardboard stock, flimsy cards, slightly warped boards.  Artwork is amazing! Finally the game suffers from AP (analysis paralysis)... but really this is a good game.
The game plays too long at the 4 player count.

I do not like relying on other players to help build my engine for me.  Timing is crucial and somewhat arbitrary.  I like the race as opposed to the Feldian point-salad.  I just wish it was inside a game with more meaningful decisions and long-term strategy.

RATING: 7
This game is a hearty, complex euro.  One-third of it is worker placement, the other two-thirds are deck-building and hand management.  Both elements constitute ways to take your one mandatory action each turn. 

What's tricky is that, for the most part, you have to burn a card to activate another, producing some brain-burning AP.  And the game's symbology is pretty opaque, at least for the first play.

But there's a pay-off in that the game is very strategic.  There is also some theme, not just mindless VP-accumulation, and some, but not much, player interaction.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very thematic. Relatively simple in things to do during your turn, but at the same time complex in the sense that you really need to think about how and when you want to do your actions.

I also like the hand building component of this game very much and the fact that there are no set rounds. Every player decides for himself when his "round" ends.

A bit on the long side with 4 or 5 players and once a player has created a efficient working engine it's hard to keep up if you're still building yours (part of the game I guess).

Lewis & Clark is one of my top favorite games released in 2013! 

Update: Just wasnt interesting enough for me to keep because of play length and runway leader issues.

Clever deck-building race game that rewards optimisation and forward planning.

After 2 plays.

Impressive... Might go to 9, or drop to an 8... Depending on how interaction develops when all players develop a knowledge of the cards and how the interact. My concern is that an early "killer" combo, might well prove to be unbeatable.
Until that is confirmed or refuted, it is a really fun game to experience. Quite demanding, in the way everything interacts, so I would recommend playing with just 3 players until the AP gets under control. Works very well with 3.

RATING: 8
Played 2x
I like that each card you buy increases your abilities and choices. But it decreases your resources and having a hand size that's too big can slow you down. But playing cards at the right time (depending on what your opponent plays) can give you a LOT of resources! So many things to balance. 

The cons: Not a lot of travel cards as a % of the deck means that luck of the draw can really affect games. You really need travel cards to advance. If they're all shuffled to the bottom of the deck except for 1, which another player grabs up, that player is at a distinct advantage. The cards are not cycled through in a quick enough way to remedy this. But this is a rare situation. 

The second con is more of a pet peeve. The last space on the map is not very clear, but I think you need to cross the finish line flag in order to win. not stop on the last space.

Lewis & Clark was a lot of fun.  I had a slow start on the first play, but quickly clicked in was a fun first play.
There are a lot of ways to get where you need to go, but you will still run into some competition for resources with the other players.
I also like the possibility of solo play and the dynamic game board with respect to the terrain tokens.
Great game.  Great components.

Reading some of my geek buddy comments I wonder if we are playing the same game! This is a three player game that I've always felt moves pretty quickly, so I have to assume others are playing with too many people.  It takes some getting used to, but just clicks for me.

RATING: 8
A race game combining deck building and worker placement. Each player starts with the same basic deck (although the historical figures are different) and has to collect resources and workers (indians) in order to obtain means of transport (canoes and horses) and extend his deck with historical figures which each have specific properties as regards the collection of resources and/or the way in which they facilitate transport. In order to get back the cards you've played, you have to make camp. This takes a lot more time if you're overloaded with resources and have a whole lot of workers following you in their canoes. So you really have to balance your belongings with your needs. Travel light, travel fast, but don't forget you can't make it on your own.
Oh yes, did I already mention the theme is the discovery of the western parts of the North American continent? No I didn't, did I. Well, that's because during the game the only discovery you make, is that your strategy to obtain horses to get across those damn mountains sucks big time... The game is not about discovery at all. It's a rather complicated race game. This does not mean it's no fun. It is. There are also a lot of different cards in the game, and this increases replayability.

Lewis & Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way.

I'd love to see more Euro games like this that actually have a victory condition (as opposed to just collecting points throughout the game or adding up points at the end).

To win this game, you have to reach the Pacific Ocean first, but it's not simply a race to a certain number of points. As you travel, portions of the trip are by river and portions are through mountains and you sometimes have to sacrifice progress because of delays setting up camp. The timing of the travel, setting up camp and the transitions between river and mountain and back again make it a challenging journey and not just a race to 100 points.

Added to that are the excellent and interlocking card mechanisms. Cards can be used in two different ways--for their action or to use their level to multiply another card's action. Beyond that, the cards also have resource icons that affect the resources you (and your neighbors) can collect. Many of the cards do interesting and unusual things, not just +1 This and +1 That.

That would all probably be enough to impress me, but there's also a shared worker pool of Native American Indian meeples. The actions these workers can take, and the costs and benefits of having boats to carry Indians and resources, and the ability to use Indians to increase activations of cards, all just work together with everything else here to make a great game.

The biggest downside to the game is that some turns can be very long since you'll sometimes have a ton of planning to do and a myriad of options to consider. (There is serious brainburn available here.)

Another minor quibble is that the game could use a few more resource tokens. They provide some 3X multiplier tiles, but I'd have preferred 5 or 6 more resource tokens, particularly for wood.

Very good game.

Well constructed middle-weight Eurogame with interesting innovations and a feel unlike other games, mostly because it is a race game and not strictly a building game.

But the desire to finish exactly before making camp has turned this into an AP fest. A mid-weight Eurogame with significant AP is not a game. A shame, and possibly less of a problem once we all know the game better.

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this game.  I played once, and felt like it was a fun different experience that required a lot of look ahead to avoid shitting the bed (which people seemed to do regularly).  There are even some long term decisions about how quickly to start out the expedition instead of upgrading your party.  It is this point that informed the second game I played, and led to all players falling back a few measly spaces and engine building for about an hour.  The effect of this was once we did move we rocketted through the terrain (one, who got some amazing cards, took off several turns after the first break and still ended up winning).  This felt completely athematic, unlike the first play, and left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.  But the penalties for falling back are so minor that it seems like a reasonable strategy going forward.  If that's so, the game may not have legs enough to make it very far.

Beautiful components and art that fit the theme perfectly.

The first time playing this, my gaming group got a very important rule wrong. For some reason we had it in our head that after you set-up camp, you have to wait for all other players to set-up camp too until you can have a turn again. So, what ended up happening was when there was one person left who hadn't set up camp, they just kept going and going. I frantically looked all over the rulebook to see if there was a rule that we were getting wrong, or if we were playing one of the indian squares wrong, but I couldn't find any. We knew something wasn't right, so we ended the game early so that we could double-check the rules online and then play it again properly some other time. Boy did we feel dumb when we realized our mistake.

Edit: Eventually traded it because it never got played. Very good game, though. I hated to see it go.

What a race! What a game! Feld - you are good, but this?! COme on! All the time since the beginning you feel the preassure. It is undoubtfully an eurostyle-game. BUT - theme - is there, race - is there. Initially you try to figure out how to optimize your deck... so you grow, then you are finishing - but you are not :) you have to cycle through your deck first - before you camp - otherwise you did not finish fist :) I would say it is one of a kind!

There is only one thing that can destroy the game and the feeling  of it... it's euro-style optimization players, that will take all the possible time on their turn to slow down, optimize, calculate... this kills the game (same I have experienced in Amerigo).

RATING: 6
I think this is probably a 6 or a 7.  You are setting off on a race to move a bunch of spaces..either across the water or across the mountains.  A hand of cards gives you options to spend resources to move or collect resources.  The trick is knowing when to play each card.  There is a ton of other stuff that is of minor importance.  Many of the actions spaces are very situational and rarely get used.  Also there is a big deck of cards that you can purchase.  However, once you get a couple of the key cards, the remaining deck becomes irrelevant.

All in all, this is a good game, but not great.  It feels like this game was pulled out of the oven before it was done.  It needed some more playtesting to iron out some of the rarely relevant things to do.

This game has some good ideas.  I especially liked the way that players must switch to an entirely different engine in order to cross the mountains.  That was very nicely thematic.  

However, the game design goes out of its way to make it difficult to accomplish anything.  L&C needs a few fewer mechanisms and a bit more player interaction.  I want my battle to be with the other players, not the game design itself.  As it stands, this game just grinds my mental gears in a way I find unpleasant.

Purchased on Discount. I was interested in the Engine Building aspect.
The race aspect makes the game quick, but not without some decision points. You need to react to how other people are playing the game, and that goes beyond paying attention to when your neighbors are camping and how many badge icons are available.

I'd play a 2-player game any day, and would warily enter into a 3-player one. It's not that it's crazy long with more players (it is, but that's not a massive problem), it's just very dull when it's not your turn and it's longer than it needs to be for the sort of game that it is. It's effectively a race, and it couldn't be any slower.

Complaints aside, I love dual-usage on cards. Whenever you want to play a card, you've got to consider which other card you'd be willing to give up to power up the original one. The worker placement element feels a little tacked on, but it works.

The amount of mechanics mashed together in this game Make it a great "gamer's game", but it can be a hassle to teach and can scare away casual gamers.  It has card drafting, deck building, worker placement, and a card activation mechanic that can be a real brain burner.  I would not recommend this to anyone that suffers analysis paralysis.

A race down the river to discover the Wild West of the United States of America. Sounds like a great concept for a game. And if you strip Lewis & Clark down to its basics then you have a fairly simple system. Stripped of its veneer you are simply playing a card which either collects resources or converts resources into points (moving up the river). You can spend resources on either buying points (moving up river), or on buying new cards, which mostly simply allow you to use your resources more efficiently and effectively in the future. When you pick your played cards back up ('set up camp') your points take a hit depending on the resources you have and the cards in hand. The first one to get to 40 points (reach the Pacific) on a turn after you have picked your cards up (set up camp) and taken the relevant points deduction is the winner. 
And at its bare bones that is it. Yet, despite this apparent simplicity this makes a great game. Why? Four reasons: 
(1) the theme and the implementation of the theme is good. 
(2) the movement up river has an interesting twist when you hit mountains and a different set of resources are necessary to move. 
(3) thrown into the simple resource to points (movement) mechanics are Indians which do two things: they power up your cards or they can be played into a communal area instead of cards, largely for collecting resources. The former adds to the negative points you will get, the latter means your opponents can then grab the Indians you use. 
And (4) some of the cards and the Indian actions do more than increase the efficiency of the resource conversion, though perhaps there isn't quite enough variety in this area. 
So all in all Lewis & Clarke takes a very basic mechanic, adds a great theme, and then throws a few interesting spanners into the works which add a lot more than glossy veneer. 
I have two criticisms. Firstly it is largely a solitaire experience, the interaction being largely in the competition for cards and the timing of a grab for the communal Indians available. Second criticism is that there is a lot of puzzling and planning required, and on your turn you can do three things (play a card, buy a card, set up camp) and a combination of these two aspects of the game means that downtime with 4 or 5 players is very long. I have heard of 5 player games hitting 4 hours. Far too long for this game. So three will be the sweet spot. Another great game from what is looking like a terrific set of releases from Essen 2013.

My rating is probably a little harsh. Im not a big euro fan, in games where i build something I can distract my mind enough to get some enjoyment out of creating as long as things are not too competitive at the table. Here, you are simply getting points (movement) as efficiently as possible. To me it felt like an exercise in calculation. Also, and this is a bias statement that I don't apply to other genres that I do like, but worker placement games are really starting to blur into one for me. I feel like im playing a twist on a game I'm already bored with.

RATING: 7
This is a surprisingly crunchy game and I like it.  It didn't quite click for me until it was too late, so by the time the game started making sense, I had no way of catching up.  That being said, I was able to get close as the more experienced players tore away.

A tough mix of hand and resource management means L&C is a game you want to avoid playing with AP-prone people.  As a courtesy, you ought to be planning out your turn well in advance with a contingency in case someone blocks you.

When the board hits the table, the immediate feeling is Stone Age, if only because all of the worker spots are depicted in the same way with the chalk circles - the difference here (and its made very clear) that this isn't exactly a worker placement game.  The meat of the game is rather in gathering the wickedly-cool hex-shaped resource "nuts" in order to facilitate you moving down the river and crossing the mountains as quickly as possible.  Workers (Natives) facilitate this, but the bulk of the game is in using your hand of cards to perform actions.  The neat thing here is that you must sacrifice cards in order to power up the ones you want to use, thereby robbing you of the chance to use the other one until you gather them back up into your hand.  However, doing so too early will actually hinder your progress as each card remaining in your hand when you do the gather action will send your explorer backwards.  It's a very clever way to ensure that players are optimizing the use of all of their cards before daring to pick them back up.  As the game goes on, each player will have opportunities to spend precious resources to either move along the track to victory or buy up better cards.  It's a wonderful decision tree that doesn't feel overwhelming, but again, avoid AP players.

In fact, for any game, avoid AP players.  You people are the friggin worst.

Relatively long and moderately complicated.  Combines deck-building, worker placement, and "racing" (though the "racing" element is essentially score track, with a few quirks).  Have yet to play a full game, but feel that replay value may be high.  Historical facts and characters interesting.

I was thinking I'd immediately fall in love with this game as soon as I played it.  As it happened, after the first few plays I thought it was a solid game but love was not part of the equation.  The cards are all kind of similar and you can kind of see who's going to win three quarters of the way through the game.

As I play it more, I'm really starting to love it.  I merely liked the game before because I didn't really understand all of the options in front of me.  Unimpressive looking cards can be used to crushing effect when used at the right time and/or accompanied by the right actions.  You really have to plan hard in this game and look at all of the options as they unfold.  

You need to have a strategy, but you also need to be open to changing it should better possibilities crop up in the cards that become available.  All that careful thought is rewarded by watching your scout and camp steamroll up the river and past everone else.  One of my favorite games here.

The only drawback of this game is that it requires a good bit of thought so there tends to be a good bit of silence at the table if people are quietly taking their turns.  The art in this game is great though and if players get into their hand of people then there are many laughs to be had.

Quite reminiscent of Stone Age, but with an added deck building component and a limitation on the number of resources players can safely stockpile. Very fun with two, as plays pass each other as they camp along the river. Looking forward to more plays as not many of the additional cards made their way into my deck.

Card play is what sets this apart from other German games. Everyone starts with the same hand, but you can fine tune your hand by buying and discarding cards. Similar to TS, you can play a card for either its action or its strength but not both. Every card that you don't play by the time you collect points (i.e. camp) counts as negative points. So just play every card, simple right? Wrong because many cards give you resources, and unused resources count as negative points as well! As in TS, you need to have a plan for how to use each card and when to play it. On your turn you can play a card or place a worker but not both, so you have to factor that into your plans as well. The path of river and mountain spaces is really just a scoring track, yet it manages to evoke the racing theme well. 1-3

Awesome theme and components. I really like some of the mechanics in this game. Hard not to compare this to Concordia given the hand management similarities... I give a slight edge to Concordia because it's a little more streamlined, I prefer Concordia's shared map to L&C's shared worker placement board and I like how scoring is obfuscated in Concordia... in my one play of L&C it was obvious who was out of contention fairly early.

Basically there are 7 types of resources to manage: wood (typically used for upgrading your resource/Indian capacity), fur (typically for card acquisition), equipment (also for card acquisition), food (typically for movement along the river), canoes (more efficient movement along the river), horses (movement along the mountains), and Indians (playing cards, strengthening card effects, and board play).  Besides the unique score track, I find it interesting that you can navigate resource acquisition through card play and through the board.  There are many things to consider between the card play, the board play, the score track, and how your resource management affects the score track.  There are aspects of this game that I didn't even try in my first game: I didn't cull a single card from my deck, I didn't use the space on the board that allows you to copy card effects, and I didn't purge the card acquisition track once.  There is definitely a lot of space to explore (pun intended).  Beyond the mechanisms of this game, the game is not only gorgeous but also has a really nice historical flair.  I hadn't even heard of Lewis and Clark and if it wasn't for reading about the game on BGG, if someone had talked to me about the game, I probably would have thought Lois & Clark, the new adventures of superman.  The rule book not only talks about the expedition, but also gives a card-by-card historical blurb about every character card.  Even more impressive is that every players starting characters which are mechanically identical, have unique names, illustrations, and historical information.

This actually has, in my opinion, a fair bit in common with Concordia.  I say this because there is a card market that escalates in cost and when you purchase from it the card goes to your hand.  In both games you will play cards down and at a time of your choosing (up until you no longer have a choice) you can get all of your played cards back.  Also, in each game, your turn is structured in such a way that you play a card from your hand (you have extra options in L&C though).  Concordia and Lewis and Clark both have limited space for resources (well, L&C doesn't have a hard limit but punishes you for having more than necessary). There are more similarities than that, but what makes them different? Concordia marries the victory conditions to cards in your deck with a spatial map and unique resource acquisition. I think of L&C's race track as a VP track with rivers spaces being one type of VP and mountain spaces being another.  L&C marries unique victory conditions to some cards with a worker placement mechanism on the board.    

I do have a minor quibble that has to be mentioned.  The game sometimes feels very... gamey.  In some respects anyway.  Before I give an example, I'll just say that having too many resources on your player board and having cards in your hand can impede your victory condition.  So, you can play cards and not do anything with them. In regards resources, the game rules specifically say you can't ever dump resources unless you go above capacity but you can take less than you need anytime you would acquire resources. So, you can also place Indians on the board, block certain spaces, and not do anything with it.  Actually there are 2 space on the board that allow you to place 1-3 Indians at a time and these spaces have unlimited capacity (ie you can't block the spaces).  You can do this to trigger the space 3 times, but it feels gamey to place 3 there at a time and not do anything in the space simply because I have too many Indians in my expedition.  Also, in one of the two previously mentioned spaces you may discard 3 different types of resources (including a horse) to produce one horse and you can do this a number of times equal to the 1-3 Indians you place there.  Oh look, I have too many non-Indian resources and Indians with having to set up camp soon because my cards are used up. I guess I'll send 3 Indians to the horse space.  I'll activate it two of my three times because I don't have enough resources to do it thrice but I still want to get rid of an Indian. So, I'll trade a horse, a fur and a piece wood for one horse and then 1 piece of equipment, another fur and another horse for a horse.  That just feels incredibly gamey to me.  I'm more of a fan of mechanisms compared to theme though, so I can put it out of my head.  I just thought I would mention it because it's wonky.

If you like any of the following, don't hesitate to at least try this game: worker placement, resource management, card combos, racing and hand management. This game shouldn't be played with 4 or 5 players, because it overstays its welcome. I would say it's best to learn it with 2, to keep the time down. I personally recommend Concordia over this when you consider the ease of play and various maps that make all player counts enjoyable.

Despite being a hodgepodge of mechanics, Lewis & Clark manages to combine its small elements of deck building, worker placement, and resource management combine to create satisfying decisions that invoke the stresses of leading an expedition. The most notable aspect of this game is its representation of time and emphasis on pace; the larger your corps, and the more resources you stock, the longer your journey. This essence of time permeates through every game decision and forces players to establish an optimal tempo for their corps. Adding members to the corps increases one's flexibility, but slows down their deck cycle, and stocking up on resources when they are most prevalent, might save on future actions, but hampers forward progress. This manifestation of time, creates a powerful 'two steps forward one step back' cadence that can doom the a corps if not embraced in their plans. This element of time has proven difficult for new players to embrace, and games often linger longer than desired, but there is enough explore in Lewis & Clark to merit multiple expeditions.

RATING: 8.5
This is a game for people (like me) who like to combine bonus powers in a race to build and an engine in order to ... in this case, literally race. And while I like this kind of game in general, I particularly like L&C because I find every aspect of the design tight and relevant. 

The worker placement element feels fresh thanks to the way workers are used in the game and the way resources are collected. Workers may be gained or lost via placing on board (vs using on your private action spaces) And you can't easily horde resources -- or workers -- because you're punished for how much stuff and workers you have when you camp. 

And this is where the cards come in; the heart of the game. The point of this game is identifying the cards that will help you navigate the tight worker and resource restrictions the game places on you. Targeting the ones you want and finding combos that work well together -- and being able to buy them before your opponents -- is a large part of this game's DNA. If the card choices are anything but a delight to consider, then I'd say this isn't a game for you.

All in all, I find the creativity required here a delight with how you use and lose your workers and the cards with which you build your engine. I particularly like how everybody ends up doing their own thing. Some save up for big moves, others are happy to go a few spaces at a time. Some shoot up to the mountains and sit while others catch up. 

The game comes with chits to vary the terrain that in theory sound great but we're nowhere near ready for any variation. Lastly, the game also plays solitaire which I'v found to be a little less interesting than I'd hoped but still a worthwhile training ground.


***RULE CLARIFICATIONS***
1) You cannot send 1 Indian on the horse spot and get rid of 2 resources, you need a 3rd different resource to be able to do it. If you don't have any, you can send the indian for nothing, without getting rid of any resource.

2) You  may send Indians to, say, the canoe spot on the board with no wood just to get rid of them (still an action, of course).

3) When your boats are all full, if you collect new resources, you have the choice: either you discard the new reources you have just got, or you get rid of some of the old resources you already have on your boats, in order to make room for the new ones.

The game is quite unique. I love the "camp" system, where you have to move backwards in order to establish a camp if you have too many resources or cards on hand. The hand management mechanisms is great (that you have to use a card for triggering the action once, twice or thrice), as well as the interaction it creates, since you may use the cards of other players.
The first time you play, you get a little head ache, since there are many steps to take before you can actually do what you have planned for.
It is a good sign that you want to play again immediately.

A really interesting fusion of worker placement/resource management and deck building. I really enjoyed the race type mechanic for victory, and the component quality is good.  
The dual sided nature of the cards is also quite novel... although it means clear sleeves only!

Font on the cards is a little difficult to read and the iconography is not the simplest however the game flows very well as you take an action on your turn, and then make camp/purchase a new card as an optional extra. 

I played with a few rules wrong and initially game play was very slow and clunky as I tried to get to grips with how it played but I did enjoy and shall be taking this one with me to the next game event at my FLGS

I've enjoyed playing this a lot, although each games has taken ages. For relatively simple decisions, largely independent of other players, it takes a long time for each person to discuss why this move is the best thing they can do right now.

Once I start playing with people who already know the game, it will speed up. It's a nice game, nice graphic design, pretty much a good board and game design. But the hoped for inter-action is scant and the game might work best with three players.

RATING: 6.5
Not sure why I didn't write anything back when I played it. I love Discoveries, so I feel like I should explain why this one doesn't get as high a score. My recollection was that I loved the mechanisms, especially how the Native Americans function, and how crucial the decision to fold up camp could be, both when doing it oneself and counting on other players not. But I also recall feeling like it was punishing and had a decidedly disjointed rhythm. I see others complain about a runaway leader problem, and that sounds plausible to me. So I'd gladly play it again, I think, but I won't go looking for it.

Makes small-deck deckbuilding part of the engine for a great race game. Very thinky. Beautiful graphics. I predict this game will be an 8 for me for at least the first 15 plays; I may trade it after that. Very good game I'm glad I get to own for a while.

Rating history: 8|10|10|10|8|8....

10 plays: :star::star::star::star::nostar: - My current rating.
Initially: :star::star::star::star::star: - Plays 2-4.

[b]6 plays in,[/b] and the shine of the game has worn off. What am I left with? A very challenging race game that uses two favorite mechanics (deckbuilding, and resource conversion). I expect this will stay an 8 for another half dozen plays at least.

I have talked to a lot of players who say this is a hard game to play, and I am truly baffled by this assessment.  It's medium weight in my opinion with a setup and board that is easily followed for available actions.  Lots of cards for variety with icons easily understood. Strategy equal to a lot of good Euros with similar mechanics.   Deck building, worker placement, resource management rolled into a race.  Theme & components, nice.

I'm a big fan  of Hand Management in games so it's no surprise I really enjoy this game, as it's right in my wheelhouse.

I'd rate this higher but I find it annoying how none of the non-starter cards seem intuitive. I feel like a player needs to make too many trips to the rulebook just to see how a card works.

RATING: 8
The art is beautiful, and the race objective and emphasis on not just efficient use of resources but on spending or storing them all are fresh.

There's a tendency towards AP, and the profusion of powers is a little overwhelming, but I like the challenge.

We seemed to be drowning in resources.

Egy nagyon jól összerakott euro. Pakliépítés, munkáslehelyezés, verseny mechanikák jó ötvözete. Különösen tetszik az interakció a játékban: a kijátszott kártyáidat magad elé teszed. Mindegyiken van egy szimbólum, ha valaki ehhez a szimbólumhoz tartozó kártyát játszik ki később, akkor jobban tudja végrehajtani az adott akciót. Így valamennyire akaratlanul is támogatjuk egymást, ami nehéz döntéseket szül néha. Egy baj van csak vele: a játékidő. Nekünk hármasban majdnem 3 órát tartott az első játék, és félek, hogy egy következő se lenne rövidebb. Ez azért már olyan sok, hogy akadályozza a játék asztalra kerülését.

It is good to see that there is still room for innovation in worker placement games although worker placement certainly isn't the primary focus of Lewis & Clark. Hand management is probably a better fit but again the game tweaks the well-known mechanism slightly to create something very different. The real game changer, however, is the punishment for having hoarded too many resources at the end of the turn. In this case, more is most definitely not always better.

Agonizing choices, delicate timing question and vastly diverging strategies, sounds like a recipe for success. There are four niggles that dampen the enthusiasm a little bit, however. Firstly, the multitude of choices offers ample opportunities for AP to set in. Choose wisely who you play with. Secondly, the winner-takes-it-all race aspect is something I'm not particularly fond of but that's simply personal preference. Arguably, neither of these is really a fault with the game. And lastly, the gameplay is a little solitaire-ish. A bit more interaction would be lovely.

What I am most disappointed of, however, is that hanging back in the beginning and stocking up without regards to your load seems to be such a strong approach. It kind of kills a lot of the appeal of the game, trying to inch forward without carrying too much of a burden with you and at the same time stops much of the leeching and thus a large part of what little interactivity there is. I don't want to go as far as to say it's a game breaker, but it has certainly cost the game a rating point or two with me.

RATING: 7
Ein strategisches-taktisches Wettrennspiel mit Karten-Deckbau-Engine, das sich als Arbeiterein-Einsetzspiel tarnt. Nicht leicht zu spielen. Vor allem nichts für Greenhorns. Man braucht mindestens eine Partie, um überhaupt zu verstehen, was man theoretisch tun muss. Bis dahin haben geübte Spieler ihre Karten-Kombi längst uneinholbar aufgebaut. LEWIS & CLARK lässt keine Fehler in der Planung des Kartenmotors zu. Zudem scheint sich ein Vorgehen herauszukristallisieren, dass man wartet, wartet, wartet und dann den Fluss in einem Ruck nimmt und sich nicht in einzelnen Schritten flussabwärts zum Ziel müht wie das Greenhorn. Diese monochrome Siegstrategie wäre schade, denn das Spiel hat eine schöne, individuelle Idee und seinen eigenen Charakter im unberührten Wilden Westen.

I like the game very much. It is a nice mix between planning ahead and reacting to the situation.
Negatives: The interaction between players could be a bit more direct .
The way the game is designed you have some points where you have to stop and plan ahead for the next turns. This leads to some significant downtime as each player reaches this point at different moments.

More plays may adjust my rating. the bits were serviceable, but could have contributed far better to the theme. The game is a racing game of us all trying to make our way down a straight path of squares with the assistance of Native Americans that we somehow hire to perform labor for us. The mechanics cause some awkward thematic moments at places. There is some fun in play, once we finally wrapped our heads around what was going on. The game elements seem too subtle/complex to really play this one casually and competitively without the game overstaying its welcome. It is a game of timing your plays and forethought about resource acquisition.

Capolavoro. Ottima rigiocabilità data dalla possibilità di modificare il percorso con le tessere fiume e montagna e grande profondità. A fornire ulteriori spunti e variabili ci sono le carte personaggio con le quali potenziare la propria spedizione. La grafica è davvero curata, il tabellone è ampio e molto chiaro. L'ambientazione, come è tipico dei german, sebbene non molto attinente riesce a rendere il gioco più interessante. 

Lewis And Clark merita ampiamente un posto nella mia collezione e in quelle di chi ama il piazzamento lavoratori e il card drafting. Otto pieno.

Wow! What an awesome game. It just has everything in it but manages to make a really well-flowing system. Worker placement, multiple use for cards, card drafting; it's like Stone Age, Dominion and 7 Wonders all wrapped together and yet it is its own special game. The activation system is super smart. I'm so amazed at how the designer was able to make cards and resources do so many different things and yet keep the system feeling like an essential engine running the whole time. It's a shame it didn't get picked up by a major publisher (there are semi-verified complaints about component quality) but that aside, this is a great game for 2013.

This is a good game with nice art but I have a couple of problems with it.  First, it's weird and uncomfortable thematically and actually to own the Native Americans. Also problematic is the basic mechanic of the game: it's hard to get an engine going because you get penalized for collecting resources.  This game is thematic but I think the arduous nature of the trip and the troubling relationship with the Native Americans make the theme troubling and not that much fun game-wise.

RATING: 4
Maybe with 3 or even 2 this would shine, but with four this game crawls and even feels numbingly stagnant at times (5 must be unplayable).  

I can see the cleverness of the design but something doesn't feel quite right.  I really feel the grinding of resource conversion in this one, and the mid-game transition from water to mountain travel can be extended well beyond the point of acceptable game time.  I realize this is ultimately a race game (loose definition), but the pacing feels spiritually bent.  

It's too much work and time for the decision space.

We'll see if this improves.

Based on several online plays at boardgamearena:
The game is beautiful and tight. And - even though it feels a little bit like chore i.e. you keep moving pieces here and there and when you finally find your ideal little engine you keep turning it and maybe a tweaking a little bit - it is indeed, surprisingly, engaging and fun! And finding those little combos that might move you just a little bit further... oh! And Indian-management is also crucial, although it might slow you down a lot.
Cool game.

Solo game was hard as I had not yet learned to make optimal actions. Didn't find the solo game as much fun as it was with another player. 

The mountains are tough to get across unless you recruit some good characters. 

Beautiful game and gameplay that appears to have a lot of replay value. I suspect that as I become more familiar with the game, subtle player interaction will increase.

For the first time, we played a game (this one!) three times in a row in one evening.  After each game, we discovered a bit more about the game, and wanted to see how it would play out again.  This could become a new 10 game with a few more plays at this rate.

After five plays the game continues to shine brightly! I love the card play, the worker placement, the myriad of choices that each turn presents.  Somewhat reminiscent of Goa in a couple of ways (one being the gaining of resources when gaining a boat), the planning or sequencing of one's moves during the time between encampments must be carefully thought out, lest the player be penalized by loss of time.  Remarkable for me personally in that my "nongamer" wife has enjoyed 3 plays of the game and expresses an admiration for it.

Nothing really wrong with the game.  Has a little engine building via actions which you add to a deck.  The game is about moving one of two ways: by water or by mountain.   That's it.  You get goods to power things to do one of those two things.  I found it very dry, and overly long.

A deceptively heavy game. Great solo and multiplayer, but with other players you really have to think outside the box to win. You have to predict what people might play, when they might play them, and when they plan to take cards back into their hand and camp. If you misread that, all your best laid plans can be for naught. This is one of the best games I own because the rules are relatively simple, but the decision set is incredibly deep. Fantastic game.

Lewis & Clark is a very good worker placement/hand building game for 1 to 5 player.  The goal of the game is to be the first player to travel from St. Louis to Fort Clatsop.
This game have a lot of replay value because the cards that are available to take will be different every game.  For even more diversity, you can also use tokens to change some spaces on the board from river to mountain or vice versa.  The solo mode is good to learn how to play but this game is at its best with 3 to 5 player.

Also it remains tense until the end and every time it's winning by a thread.  My only complaint is that the mountain part is very unforgiving for new players who feels left out the race.

reat art, theme, mechanics, and game play. I loved this one. The worker placement mechanic was unique in that you lose the workers. The card row didn't even use 1/4th of the total cards meaning every game will be different. Half way through the game you need to completely change what you're doing to get over the mountains. The game is a "race" and we were neck and neck almost the entire game until one of us pulled ahead at the very end. So good.

RATING: 10
This is great game if you enjoy engine building and history. It can be a pretty long game and the teaching curve can be steep, but once you go through a couple of turns you should be good to go. One of the reasons it can be long is because you have many choices on each turn and your best option may change depending on what action the previous player took. There will also be lots of rulebook reading when it comes to all the various cards but once you understand their icons that too will become easy. This game does not make it to the table as much as I would like because it is a heavier game and takes the right mix of players. It works well with two or more players, but the more players you have the more downtime between turns. More players also means more resources so the game actually moves quicker (more resources, more cards to buy, more actions to take, etc.)

A race game that includes worker placement, card drafting, and engine building. Surprisingly, it all works together fairly well. The problem for me was the length coupled with repetitiveness.
Beautiful artwork and very clear design elements.

This game frustrated me because I wanted to like it more than I did. I might be persuaded to try it again, but I doubt it.

Wonderful game chock full of choices, great art, and a lot of history.  I like the simple deck building concept and using cards for multiple purposes.  Trying to optimize your weight and size of your expedition is a fascinating engine building mechanic.

This feels like it would be a nice step up from Stone Age, not because the games are overly similar, but the concept of using combinations of goods to achieve a goal would be familiar.

This is an interesting game with a clever way to use cards. I think people get turned off by what they feel is the first slog through the mountains. I never felt that, and I think this is probably due to bad play early. You need something to efficiently get you either horses or mountain movements, you should be doing that early and just using the card to power other cards! I look forward to further plays.

Pretty good race game that combines deck building, hand/resource management and worker placement. The only problem is that you lose time when you camp (go back on the track) for holding too many resources, and you can't just dump them, which requires planning and calculations that make the game feel much heavier than it should be.

I like the race and build your own engine aspect of this game.  Starting to think that 3 players may be the best number to streamline play time.  Really nothing you can do to your opponents in the game.  It may become obvious who will win several turns out and it can be frustrating sitting there watching it happen.

RATING: 7
(Only played once, 5-player)

What I liked most and felt (to me) very innovative was the a-simultaneous gameplay, from the point of the first player setting up camp onward. That's when players' tableaus start diverging: others may have nearly all their cards out, while your tableau is empty after just having set up camp. This has an interesting effect on your decision making and also indicates how your chosen path in this game is different from everybody else's. 

Understanding the cards laid out for purchase was hard. Many were not intuitive in their iconography and we had to reference the rulebook constantly. And for that, I find, there were too many visible at one time.  

Also a 5-player game takes too long. A full game night. Nearly 4 hours! (Admittedly we were all new to the game.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The yo-yo effect with resource collection is interesting for a race game but what really pushes this game is how well the theme fits the game mechanics.  Each card ability seems thought out and planning to bring just enough supplies to get to the next campsite is challenging but fun.

The game can get heavily skewed based on the luck of what cards are available for purchase on a player's turn but for the most part the game seems well balanced.

Good racing game. I actually can't think of a racing game that I like much, but this one is really cool. There are many things to do and to consider, which makes the game pretty strategic. The (nice) mechanics are interwoven well.

On the other hand, the cards aren't interesting enough, nor do they differ enough. Playing this one efficently will show that you don't need most of the stuff that the game has to offer. Cards are mainly bad and there's no time or reason to get more boats. Even the indians are rarely taken, due to the lack of time.

I wish the cards would be much more unique and balanced. One or two more different obstacles (besides water and mountains) would help this, too.

Essen'13
Eurogame de col·locació de treballadors i gestió de mà on guanya el primer en arribar a una determinada casella. Les cartes es poden fer servir de diferents maneres i el joc penalitza l'acumulació de recursos i el "tortugueo".

Té un mecanisme tipus deckbuilding molt interessant, has d'anar millorant la teva mà mitjançant noves cartes d'un stock però sense conservar les que ja no et son útils, ja que això et penalitza. D'aquesta manera sembla que s'evita el atzar en el robament de cartes aleatoriament de una baralla i dona més possibilitats de planificació.

Té moltíssimes possibles estrategies i la rejugabilitat ve donada per l'ordre en el que apareixen les cartes (a més de poder variar el recorregut mitjançant tokens de terreny).

Actualització després de més partides: tot i el nombre elevat de cartes, després de unes quantes partides es repeteix sempre l'estrategia a seguir per guanyar la partida, agafant només un parell o tres de cartes necesaries i deixant pasar la resta. Més repetitiu del que semblava en un principi...

RATING: 5
On one hand, it's interesting mechanically and it prevents players from going all-out on tableau and hand-building quite well. Feels intricately puzzly.

On the other, the game is very, very prone to AP because it requires you to use everything so carefully and penalizes you (and potentially very harshly in the mountains) for not being exceedingly precise.

Fun but it's just too bad that the game encourages over-analyzing so much.

An absolutely gorgeous race Euro. This one is great because your strategy changes every game since the cards that appear are different each time. This gives a lot of variety in gameplay.

The game has a lot of interesting mechanisms. I want to like the game, but it disappoints me. It boils down to getting the best engine first (most move for least number of actions) to win. Randomness when drawing the available cards to buy can prevent all but one player from getting the "good" cards.
Also, The simple engines seem win over the complex ones, since they take less time (actions) to acquire and to execute. This sort of makes the engine building a bit dull.

Once a player has a good engine going, the lack of player interaction and catch-up mechanisms causes a runaway leader problem.Who will win is often apparent after about half of the game has been played. This sort of kills any tension.
The game is too long for what it offers with 4+ players.

My personal Perfect Game - it just does absolutely everything right (for me).

Also, the artwork is tasteful and phenomenally colorful at the same time, and the playing experience itself demanding, but in the best way possible.

Try it if you get a chance, and if you like good, rich euros, with little randomness - look no further.  

edit: Dropping to '9'after a few more plays - still a great game, though.

The race game that you might forget is a race game.

You have a hand of cards that lets you do different actions, mostly centered around collecting different types of resources or moving along the expedition track. You can also buy cards that have different or improved versions of the starting cards. One thing nice is you'll rarely see all the cards in the deck (and of course the order is completely random) so you'll have to something different each game.

RATING: 7.5
Essentially a race game but with an innovative combination of worker placement and deck building / hand management driving progress. 

This is a beautiful game from an aesthetic point of view, it's satisfyingly thinky, presents plenty of choices and gets bonus points for its simple but effective solitaire option.

On the downside, I didn't find the game particularly intuitive for the first couple of plays (though it certainly played smoothly enough thereafter) and I found it somewhat harder to teach than other games of similar weight.

Purchased at Essen 2013
-----
Played a 2p game. Really enjoyed it! It was very close the entire game...I was about 1-2 turns away from finishing it. Got stuck in the last mountain range right at the end.

The "deck building" element is so much nicer than a lot of the other board games with deck building (ie Mage Knight, Legendary, etc) because you get the card you recruit immediately. There is no hoping you will be able to draw it with the other cards that work together. Being able to expand your player area to told more Indians and resources is also great. All around a very nice game which I hope to play with more players.

RATING: 7
At very least this is a first-time game design where the designer has thought about his design and then produced something original, rather than the half-formed, derivative stuff that flows unceasingly from Kickstarter. It helps to be thoroughly familiar with the card deck, so not a game you're going to do well at on the first (or even second) play. It's very much about timing, so you're given opportunities by your neighbours, but a refreshing race game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good resource management racing game.  It's also a shuffle-free deckbuilder which punishes you severely if you don't use your whole deck.  The power system of cards is interesting--you play another card or some Indian tokens with each card to show how many times you get to do an action. There is some resource conversion, which is just complex enough to be interesting without being convoluted.

traded Fresco for this.  Bit racist in a naive European way.  Uses the same card hand mechanic as Concordia (minor deck building).

路易斯與克拉克這款桌遊真的讓我很喜歡，說說其中的要素吧!

1. 機制非常直覺，與主題契合。比方說資源屯太多就會讓船變慢、遇到山脈就要換
     乘馬匹、消耗肉給船員讓船前進等等。
2. 平衡非常好，唯一的運氣部分就是每回合會遇見的幫助者，但事實上靠初始船員
     計算的好一樣能獲勝，常常到最後每個玩家差2、3步，非常刺激!
3. 美術與卡片設計非常用心，所有的卡片都不重複，每個角色皆為實際上存在的歷
     史人物，能做的事也跟他們自身有關聯!

總結，如果你喜歡西部拓荒主題、競速、工人擺放與資源轉換，買下去決不會失望!

Juego de gestión de recursos que incluye una mecánica de gestión de mano curiosa.

Se trata de un juego ambientado en la exploración del norte de América en la época un pelín anterior al "lejano oeste". Cada jugador pilota una tripulación que tendrá que hacer avanzar su expedición en una carrera por llegar el primero a un punto.

La gracieta del juego está en ir adquiriendo una serie de personajes (cartas) que permitirán por un lado realizar acciones y por otro lado pagarlas, acompañándolas de nuestros indios (kekos)

Tanto los kekos como los recursos los meteremos en nuestras canoas, que son limitadas y presentan un coste adicional de cara a establecer el campamento (que permite recuperar las cartas jugadas).

Gráficamente muy vistoso

Really cool race game with a bit of an engine building feel. But you can only build up so much since you really need to use as many of your resources as possible before you rest and get your cards back to use. I love this aspect of the game, that requires fairly precise planning to make sure you have enough, but not too many resources. It's also really cool how you can only use about half of your cards between rests and you can power them up with the same guys you use for the worker placement. The worker placement itself is pretty interesting in how it can sort of round out what your cards can't do, besides being the only way to get more storage space. And you have to be really careful how you gain and lose workers just like resources. I also really like the hand building aspect, that mechanic is quickly becoming one of my favorites. And you really do need to find some good way of getting over mountains, because the way in your starting deck won't cut it.

Some good ideas and great theme, but ultimately too complicated for the limited time and scope of the game--get to the end of the board. It's a gamer's game in rules and concept overhead but with a kind of samey--turn goods into better goods, optimize your deck play feel.

After a first game of "whaaaa???" you will have an appreciation for how everything works--it is consistent and logical. I would be a lot more comfortable the next time I played and would likely play a lot better also. But I'm not inclined to do so.

The Indians, the boats, the camping, the huge array of characters integrate well with each other and the theme as a whole. Pretty and functional map, counters and cards. Beautiful. The history is fantastic.

There seems to be a high degree of luck regarding getting mountain transportation. Someone can luck into a character that provides an efficient means for mountain crossing. I'm guessing among players of relatively equal strength, that's huge.

I was in the minority of people I talked to at the convention where I played this--most loved it.

RATING: 7
This is a light Euro.  Each player has a counter on a track that covers different type terrain that requires different cards to traverse.  This is basically the score track.  It's essentially a deck-building game where you accumulate better cards that help you get resources that you can then use to advance more quickly on the track.  There is also a worker placement aspect but it doesn't really work and is mostly ignored.  It's interesting but not one that I'm itching to play again and it hasn't been hitting the table.

Best "new to me" game in 2014...thought there was a runaway leader problem until I had a two player game with a dramatic catch-up and pass in the final mountain stretch.

Lewis & Clark's rule set isn't that complex, but understanding how to build the engine needed to advance west isn't initially obvious. Moreover, learning how to make that engine extremely efficient is where the game provides its depth. It is a task that involves a mix of learning how to leverage the cards made available and executing one's strategy with the right timing. While the pace can drag at higher player counts, it's a thematic, rewarding adventure for those who learn how to make the trek.

I love this game.  I have given it a couple plays and cannot stop thinking about it!  I will definitely come back with a more complete review after a few more plays.

EDIT:

After many more plays this game to me still stands.  It is currently one of my absolute favorite games.  I love the complexity of it.  I love the history of it.  I love the art in it and most of all I love the incredibly interesting decisions that you are forced to make while playing it.  

The price point of this game is fantastic making its value all the more so!  If you want a little bit of a heavier game, get this game!

This game brought out the AP in me. I'm probably better off with the dice game. I did win my first game, though. This is probably one of those games where more experience will reduce the AP as decisions become more obvious, but at the same time, I'll somehow have poorer results.

I've heard this described as being a racing game... but not really unless you describe Settler's of Catan a racing game... only thing you are racing to do is to be the 1st to "make camp" past a given number of points (which just happens to graphically look like a race track/finish line)

In any case deck building, worker placement, etc... liked it, but will have to try again as it got boring as I got my "engine" (my "deck") put together 1st w/out moving at all on score track which allowed me to move up to 18 spaces at a time, so just kept running same thing, generate raw resources, convert to premium ones that the card I had (Old Roy?) then took to move.  "Easy" win :)

Hmm, more fiddly and complex than I had expected, and surprisingly quite similar to Concordia mechanically. There's a lot of good stuff going on, but a couple of things rubbed me the wrong way:

1. It seems players can fall back voluntarily, eating the five space penalty, but giving themselves unlimited time to build up an uber-expedition (ships, resources, personalities). Feel off somehow, somewhat like the starvation strategy in Stone Age.

2. Apart from the effects of a few cards, why use camps at all? The movement of the explorer is never governed by the position of the camp (only vice-versa)...

Also, at least when playing with five players, the game was quite long.

This is a mix of worker placement and racing in the game.  It was interesting to learn.  The first couple of turns can be difficult, but the game seems to flow well after about half of a play through.  The mixture of scout position and time made the game more interesting.

Graphic design (from a functional standpoint) is awful! But if you have good eye sight or play with someone who does, a really fun game. Only other negative is, it seems a bit snowbally. But more plays may change my opinion.

Love this game! Gorgeous art and components. Incredibly compelling gameplay with one of my favorite mechanics- play all of your cards before you can play any of them again. You need to balance so many things to keep everything running smoothly, but the game itself isn't that complicated to learn or play. Great tension through the game.

It is possible to have one player clearly going to win about 15 minutes before the game is actually over, but I've more frequently seen some very neck-and-neck finishes.

Good game, nice artwork. First gameplay was a bit difficult due to the fact that you have so many decisions to make without a good comprehension how it affects future gameplay. Rulebook is sometimes not clear on specific scenarios. 
Could also use a cheat sheet for all the different cards.
Edit: Played a solo game and it is perfect! Turned out I misread some rules during the first game, now they are clear the game plays beautiful.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2014)

As I dislike racing games (fortunately Lewis & Clarke doesn’t feel like one :D), I wasn’t expecting much from Lewis & Clarke. At first it surprised me with the game mechanics, but then I think there is a luck and a relevance issue with the cards so I’m not sure what to think of the game.

On the good side, love the decisions that arise when playing cards (which card should I keep, sacrifice or play), great art and components, very novel (for me at least) back tracing mechanism (you need to plan it carefully or lost many spaces). In short, I love the game play. 

On the bad side, I dislike that players can’t share the same spot as many times players surpassed or delayed other players by luck (not planning), also it seems unfair that a player can get ahead just by playing next in turn order. The first player has a disadvantage with the resources (as his neighbors don’t have any played cards). As with any variable card offering, I feel there is a lot of uncontrollable luck (unbalanced cards) when a good card appears and thus when the current player can buy it (I heavily dislike this), moreover in our games there was no need to really buy cards, with the ones in your hand and perhaps another previously bought card you can compete and do well. This led me to think that the cards are not that important in the game. With the same reasoning (but with less severity), the players who bought the additional expedition tiles did worse as they spent resources in tiles, not advancing. I’m not sure they are relevant or not (I played the basic game, perhaps with the custom map my card and expedition tiles issue can disappear) and I only thought of them as another way to get a resource, not for its ability to get more room with less time penalties. The game can be long. The resources can be very easy to obtain due to the multipliers, due to this there is no tension.

The theme don’t do anything for me, if anything I found it boring HOWEVER, it fits perfectly with the game mechanics. I think this is best with 3 players, with more the downtime begins to be more than I like. 

In conclusion, Lewis & Clarke is a good game. I feel it has uncontrollable luck with the cards and (paradoxically) I think the cards are not very relevant to the game. In short the deckbuilding aspect is pure tactics and thus flawed (for me). I need to explore it further to see if the card issue is real or imaginary. For now, I won’t buy the game.

I played it with 5 players and it was very boring, lots of downtime. Also, some cards are VERY powerful while others are just bad, pure luck if you manage to get one of the powerful ones.  I don’t plan to play it again but I can be convinced.

What a great game! It's not only beautiful and thematic but it is full of tough choices and allows multiple strategies to victory. I've played it at all player counts. First played with 5 players, all of us essentially learning the game, not the ideal situation. I still wanted to buy it immediately and I've been happily rewarded. Very good solo game. Plays well with 2 (and 5 if players don't get too AP) but best with 3 or 4. I feel every game is unique because the register of possible recruits changes. Thus, there doesn't appear to be a dominant strategy for victory (except go faster than other players). The gameplays have been tension-filled. Everyone who has played it has wanted to play it again.

I love how history is built into this game. But, beyond that it is just an enjoyable game to play.

RATING: 8
I don't believe the comments that this is a "light to medium" game.  It is a complex blend of worker placement, deck building, hand management, and resource management.  There are so many card combos that are amazing, many of which I am sure we haven't even figured out yet.  A game in which you are rewarded for holding back on camp and taking risks to build your deck, while other players are forging ahead on the trail.  But, as I found out during our last play, you are NOT rewarded for being greedy.  Don't let your deck get too thick!  This game is wonderful, one of those I dream about between plays.  


Might become a "10" for me after more plays and with more players.  I have only tried 2-player so far, and we have loved it.

Very unique, lots of mechanics I love but also one I am not fond of.  I really liked the game in general but there comes a point every time we play (like all race games) where the winner is more or less obvious and I really hate that in a game.  I like that there's role selection, there's an interesting deck-building mechanic, it's resource management and worker placement all at once and it's very attractive.  I got mixed up on symbolism and which symbols where on each card meant what when I put it down and there are some rules that I found easily confused/forgot about (using Indians instead of cards and how they return/you have to pay for them if used on a card vs if used in the village) but after 3 plays in the same year I think it's become intuitive enough.

Lewis & Clark contains a unique blend of mechanics and a very good theme. The game has a bit of a learning curve (mainly with the icons), but once you see how it plays, it all clicks. Gameplay is fairly smooth and the decision space is a good balance between restrictive and open-ended. Initial impression is good, but not overwhelmed. It can run  a bit long for what it is, but we had two first-timers. I'm curious to play it again and could see this rating going up.

Race from point A to point B using a combination of resources generated from Natives and recruited explorers. Card combinations abound and there is a lot of additional changes you can make to increase difficulty. Whoever gets the most Indians, though, has an advantage.

RATING: N/A
Never played this with other folks, so I can't officially rate it. Two guys in my game group have played it and have no interest in playing it again, so I'm unlikely to get it to the table soon. Trading my copy.

I did get in a learning game playing three-handed and played it to the end. This is a resource management racing game leveraging both worker placement and deck-building (actually hand-building) to get what you need. The workers are shared among all players. Once some workers are placed, as a card action a player can claim all played workers. Advancing on the track is a two step process. Players use food, canoes and horses advance their scouts and then players can choose to move their camp up to their scouts, but the scouts lose ground for every card still in hand and having too many resources or workers. The game is about balancing the advancement of your scout while using up all of your cards, resources and workers before camping. 

While I think the game is an interesting mix of mechanics and game styles, none of card or worker actions in themselves are all that interesting. The game is in the balancing act to move your camp forward. I can see, though, that each game could start to feel a bit samey after a while and I'm not sure that timing your encampments is a strong enough draw to keep coming back. I can see why my friends can very well take or leave this game. I could see myself in the same boat, as well. This game falls squarely between a 6 and a 7 for me, and those games usually end up a 6.

I typically dislike the mechanisms present but somehow the designer managed to combine them into something fun. It remains gamey/annoying that two scouts cannot occupy the same spot and thus people behind are able to jump ahead (even to the point of taking a boat over the mountains). My group has altered this to allow scouts to occupy the same spot but if two camps were to land on the same spot, the latest arrival has to move to the first open spot back not forward.

Not bad. Not great. I wish it wasn't so darn long. Both of my games have gone 3+ hours.

RATING: 8
Probably the best of the 2013 Essen crop.  Takes the deck-building concept made popular in Dominion to a race game.  Multiple paths to victory given what bonus cards to draft, and you also have to decide to go for a big expedition (with a slower rate of turnover and possible movement penalties) versus a "lean and mean" approach that avoids penalties when you camp but also may not have the right combination of drafted cards to compete with the bigger deck, and then finally there is the issue of how to play the Indian recruiting and usage aspect of the game.  Highly innovative approach to the subject, and also enjoy the historical information in the game -- similar to Founding Fathers, another favorite of mine.

This is nicely themed and since I live in St. Louis where Lewis and Clark started out, I may have a greater appreciation for the game. I liked the variety of the cards, but it helps to play with someone that knows them so you don't have to look them all up in the rule book. You have to decide whether to use your cards for actions or resources and you can get bonuses for cards that your neighbors have played. Then it is a race to see who can discover the Pacific first.

I love the mechanisms and theme. The problem for me is the opportunist planning - which does fit with theme. In a shorter or lighter game would be fine, but in a two hour heavy game not so much. The character cards make or break your game, and you cannot plan for them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the engine building. You have to carefully craft your hand to efficiently move up the river and over the mountains. Finding a mountain movement card seems very important, or, failing that, a better source of horses. The decisions you have to make to plan out your turns are interesting and at times tense. 

This game, like most race games, is prone to runaway leader issues. The end game can be absolutely boring as the winner is clear several turns in advance. Even if the win is hotly contested in a 3-4p it is likely contested between only two players. Thus players are essentially eliminated, although they get to keep taking turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Deep, brain-burning, hard—but very rewarding. Can be AP-inducing. Theme is well implemented and each character card representing a different historical figure is amazing. Components are mostly top-notch though board re-print for my edition is smaller and gets a little cramped. Also does not include resource stickers included in previous printing. Runaway leader can be a problem, as in most racing games. For all its flaws, though, it’s SO clever.

[b]My thoughts on Lewis & Clark[/b]
Lewis & Clark is an innovative hybrid of a worker placement game with a card combo hand management game, in which you'll take the role of an exploration party that tries to discover and cross the US from the east to the west coast, just like the historical figures Lewis and Clark did.
So far, I have only played this game solo, but I can't wait to explore it with more players. I really appreciate the mechanics, I love the fact that it is essentially a racing game with a fixed game ending, and the artwork is gorgeous.

A unique race game driven by building an engine out of 54 unique cards that can be bought from the display. As there's only a subset of 5 cards available at a time, players will be forced into different strategies at a time. The worker placement part luckily is only a necessary but not central addition. More decisive is clever hand management and synergistic deckbuilding.
Lewis & Clark invites to play with gorgeous artwork. The gameplay is unexpectedly thinky each move and will cause AP. Nothing for players averse to solving puzzles or solitairish games. 
For me, the result is satisfying enough to keep the promise made. My only little niggle after one game is the potentially overpowered strategy of staying behind until the engine is fully build up and then making a dash to the goal with only two or three intermediate stops. Hopefully, strategies more in the sense of the theme can be as competitive.

Had fun playing this one with my mom, a Lewis and Clark buff. At its heart it is worker placement. Calling it a racing game is a stretch. It plays out like a sort of Pillars of the Earth with cards. Unfortunately, the way that you collect resources in the game feels strange and doesn't fit the theme (how am I getting resources from other player's party members?) It also really slows down the game, while adding a level of strategy that many players enjoy. All in all, I like the game a lot, reflected by my rating. The negatives I mentioned just stick from such an otherwise great game. 

On a different note, my mom did not like the way that indians are used like a sort of currency/resource in the game. I thought that it was thematic and worked well.

Update: This game feels so different than many euros in the immediate tension you feel in planning your hands so you do not lose time when you set up camp. That is balanced by the long term strategy of drafting cards to make your engine work. It feels thematic in the specific actions you take as well as in the people (historically based) you use to take those actions. Great game!

there is a lot to like about this game such as cool mechanics and compelling gameplay, but there is too much action paralysis for my taste. you have to meticulously plan out your moves to get the maximum efficiency possible, but you can't really do this when it isn't your turn because what other people do on their turns affects your decisions. this means there is a lot of downtime between your turns as you have to wait for each other player to figure out their best possible move.

also, once you get behind there is no catching up. this is fine in a game like dominion that only takes 30 minutes to play, but when a game lasts 2-3 hours it's completely unacceptable.

As a 60 minute game I would rate it an 8, but anything over 90 minutes is just too much.

Probably need more plays, but a race game that uses very basic Eurogame mechanics (i.e. collecting cubes and trading for other cubes). The art is great though and the theme works.

The most important thing in the game is to balance you hand cards (roles). They have to be not too weak, have varied capabilities, and you should not have too much or too little of them. On this depends how far and how often your camp will advance down the river. I cannot tell that I understand everything after one play, but the game is really engaging. I want to play it again.

Žaidime svarbiausia subalansuoti savo rankoje laikomas kortas (veikėjus), kad jie nebūtų per silpni, būtų įvairiapusiai ir jų nebūtų per daug ar per mažai.

Starts very promisingly, but as soon as the thematically important mountains kick in the game slows down too much. The mountains only add anything through theme; besides that they don't give this game really anything. The game might look like a racing game, but it's really a hand building game with a big resemblance to Martin Wallace's London: you get a handful of cards which you try to play as effectively as possible after which you camp your expedition and get penalty in a way like in London. I prefer London to this first and foremost because in London players are in control of the game's clock and it's not so easy to see who's the winner some rounds before the end.

First, L&C is a hoot and a half to play: the mixture of deckbuilding and worker placement works great together, giving you different avenues towards the win. Second, I believe this is a piece of art of design: so many small details have been twisted to make this a simple but deep game. It doesn't have the thousands of counter-examples that many other games do, and make it a hassle to remember.

All in all, it's a tight game with great diversity.

This is a truly lovely game that keeps me on the edge of my seat throughout. Frustrating at times, but very enjoyable. Requires good planning and forethought, just like an actual expedition would need, and brings immense frustration and amusement when you realise that you have, in fact, managed to fill three boats full of useless meat and have acquired a huge group of Indian friends, together which are now going to set your expedition back nearly a week. Enjoyed this from the first play. Also fairly easy to teach and not too long run-time.

Selling it was the best thing that I ever did, instead of collecting dust on my shelf, my friend learned it and I've gotten to play it 3 times since.  It's a fantastic game and now that I've played it, I'm thinking about rebuying it.

I love the game for its race elements. The end game is tense and its always somehow a last card wins the game type of finish. The theme is immersive as you build your team. If you do not build up a synergy between your cards then you will feel sluggish. As if the cards are literally bickering amongst themselves. the cards are beautiful and it makes me glad to see indigenous people being represented in a redeeming light. The variety in characters is stunning, the mechanics are elaborate, the theme is immersive, and that is why this game is so valued on my shelf.

It's all about getting the right card combinations to win, and using them at just the right time. It will take a few play throughs to learn what the cards can do for you, but after that, you can be playing very quickly. Very enjoyable!

Okay game.  At least with four players it seemed that near the end it ran on a little too long.  Also, at mid-game it came down to trying to use a certain two or three cards repeatedly and then cycling through the rest of the cards so that I could camp and replenish the deck so I could once again use the three cards I really needed.  Finally, you really need an even number of cards in your hand otherwise each day/round you'll be stuck with one extra card which will put you back one extra space when it comes time to camp.

I like the combination of using both sides of the cards for different purposes, and the need to actually combine cards to get needed tasks done.  There are a lot of tradeoffs in the play of this game.  There area lot of options given to a player.

I've played 4 times, and sadly, I am just not groking this game.  I remain willing to play this game, but I won't be the one requesting it.

RATING: 7
A very unusual game, hard to pin down and put into a box. On the one hand, I bet it's very thematic, with the "2 steps forward, 2 steps back" mechanism of punishing players for setting up camp before you've used up all the Indians (whom you "own"...) and shed enough excess baggage to traverse the wilds without being overburdened. On the other hand, that's kinda not that much fun. Still, a cool design, it does some kooky stuff that most other games wouldn't even dream of, and pulls off what it's going for. Definitely worth a play to see if you enjoy this oddball.

Great theme and design. This game has lot of cards, so every game will be different. There can be different strategies and just a little bit is luck.
It just took too long with 5 players, although the competition makes this game very tense. I think it's best with 3-4 players.

This has got to be the most polarizing game I have ever played. The game is called many things: racist, AP inducing, long, difficult, a drag, etc., etc. I would never want to play this game with 4 or 5 players. I would never want to play this game with someone that is prone to AP. However, with 2 to 3 players, who aren't prone to AP, this solid engine building race game is as good as it gets. Only in the specified circumstances does this game deserve the 8 rating I bestow on it.

RATING: 5
Almost no interaction at all, but on the other hand the engine building & card play part of the game is really clever as are several other mechanisms.

Unfortunately all the good things don't help a lot, due to the game completely falling apart towards the end: you just repeat the same moves over and over again (after a certain point it's too late to adjust your strategies) and in the very end you can tell several turns beforehand who is going to win, so no need to even finish the game.

RATING: 8
(After a single solo play) - Impressive game. Hints of Race for the Galaxy, Stone Age, 7 Wonders, K2. Mostly a game of hand management where you're optimizing your plays based on current circumstance but does a great job of that puzzle. Mixes in worker placement to boot. The theme is wonderfully integrated and omnipresent - you feel the current of the river you're racing upstream on. Historical annotations for all the characters and the expedition provides additional immersion. Art is fantastic! Box insert a sigh of relief.

Likely prone to AP and could have printed some handouts of that handy turn reference at the end of the manual.

RATING: 10
Amazed at how much I love this game - has quickly become one of my favorites.  I love how this game has a physical goal that also draws you emotionally to the end unlike other worker placements (like Lords of Waterdeep) that just last an arbitrary number of rounds.  The competitive deck-building portion of the game is ingeniously employed.  The lovely artwork and the fact that each card is of a historical character add significantly.  My son just wonders why the race is only to Fort Clatsop, not there and back again.

We'll see how much this lands on the table in a couple of months.

Each player is trying to get to the pacific ocean along with their caravans using natives, special characters and resources. The game is worker placement which means there are times when you will lose simply because you can't get your players in the needed spot.

RATING: 8
Not too complicated and a very good brain burner as it's hand collection but you need to use some of your cards to power up the cards you want to play. It can be difficult to plan your next move before everyone's done theirs which can slow the game down a lot. 3 players took long enough, wouldn't want to play with more than 4! Liked the way you need to build up resources/Indians/cards but then ensure most are spent before camping to avoid slipping back and undoing all your work.

A racing game in theory. Significant aspects of engine building (or, if you will, tiny "deck" building), worker placement, and resource management. Good theme, great artwork. The designer's attention to the historical and aesthetic detail is amazing. The game mechanism is also quite interesting, although the actual flow of the game seems to be slower than I expected. Perhaps it might be prone to analysis paralysis. 2 or 3 seems to be the optimal number of players.

One of my favourite games. I love the art, mechanics and the need to plan your journey from the start. 
One thing that bothers me is neighbour based increase in resource availability, it feels weird and i cannot find any rational, story based explanation for it. One could expect decrease in resources in some area after one player gathered it, but increase? Although its helpful rule and important to remember about.

Feels refreshing and after couple of first rounds you have got the whole idea here. Long game, but luckily very little downtime. I would give it 7 at least, but two quite major problems: 1) you can build your engine at first and forget all the damage because you can't go any backward on river - after that start pushing forward quickly and win the game... boring, but effective strategy. 2) the river/mountain spaces in the end part are bit problematic, because every player get stuck in a same part of river. I would really like to see this game engine used somewhere again, because it works.

Lewis & Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new "handbuilding" mechanism fits strongly the historical background.

Preliminary rating; I'm still thinking about what to think.

This is a mixture of every gamer sweetheart from the past few years.
Worker placement combined with somewhat Dominion-like deck-building, 7 Wonders-like resource collection, RftG-like multiple use cards, all built on a kind of race game...
Actually it's quite good, but it's very fiddly, kind of the opposite of elegant. Also, don't play it with AP players as they make the game go too slow. It should not go slow! It's a race, people! Listen to your instincts!

But there is too much downtime in between your turns as your opponents go through all their possibilities. It's a "race" game. For me a timer is essential for the pace of the game to feel like racing. You have to make decisions faster.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At it's heart, it's a racing (expedition) game with deck(hand)-building, hand management, resource management and worker placement.  

You don't want your deck/hand to be extensive (5 or 6 cards seems ideal) b/c then it takes you many turns to cycle through (play) all cards in order to setup camp.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial impression is very positive as there appears to be quite a bit of difficult decision making as well as an interesting blend of deck-building, worker placement, and resource management.  Deck building occurs as you hire additional workers which generally enhance your strategy/actions and also provide higher strength support.  Worker placement is a bit unique in that the Indians are for everyone and if you use them in the village instead of your expedition, someone else could acquire their help.  Instead of playing a card, you can take an action in the Indian village.  In addition, there is a fair bit of resource management as you must acquire a number of resources and face lost time in this racing game if you maintain large stores of resources on your boats.  

Artwork is bright and colorful.  Card stock may be a bit flimsy, but I sleeve my cards in most cases anyway.  For PC reasons, the publisher might have been better served to avoid using the color red for the Indian meeples.

NEVER EVER play a teaching game with five...even if you have played before and know the rules.  Takes too freaking long!  I doubt I will play this one again with AP prone people; I don't handle the waiting well as they go through all their possibilities.

RATING: 6.5
I won, but I don't exactly know how. Maybe it's because I tried to stay lean, with not too many boats in my convoy, and rarely too much load.

S was left behind because of a lack of Indians, of too many useless cards in her hand, that set her back whenever she moved a bit, or gave her too many resources. This was frustrating. This is a flaw in the game, I think: people should never feel like they're just going through the moves with no hope.

The fight for the first position was nice.

The special powers are a little too uniform (a lot of get food/wood/fur/…), and purchasing too many cards is a bit of a pain (they set us back at the end) so we don't have too many special powers each anyway.

It's nice to each have different cards, though. The progression in terms of what we can do is nice, too (4 basic cards at the beginning, maybe 7–10 cards at the end).

It's a nice euro. I enjoyed it more than Terra Mystica, with its victory point soup that muddled the impact of our actions: at least in Lewis & Clark the race element makes us want to "move forward" instead of trying to get more points, even though the two are similar. There is more of an engine element to Lewis & Clark than in Terra Mystica, I found, which means that we learn to move fast instead of trying to opportunistically grabbing points here and there.

There's stuff I should have liked about this. I like the theme. Artwork isn't bad, though there's an inexplicable use of the infinity symbol on some cards and the usual Euroglyphics are annoying. I like that they used real people (including a dog!) and you can read about them in the rulebook. The red Native Americans are a sadly unfortunate choice, but I do like that the game emphasized just how much help the native population was. 

But good god this game is boring. Just the same thing, over and over, the same Agricola-like thirty-steps-to-get-a-horse bullshit repeated ad nauseum. Get one AP player in there and you better bring a book. It's tedious, the promising theme is under-utilized, and you can almost pinpoint the exact space on the board where you stop caring.

Beautiful artwork; good components; surprisingly deep and crunchy engine-building/race game. I really like how there are so many ways in which to build your engine based on what new cards show up, game to game. My complaints are that sometimes it can really bog down if players are spending too much time contemplating every move, and it can sometimes be so heavy as to make it a tad bit too much like work. The solo game is interesting and is a great way to learn and improve at the game.

RATING: 5
It's not that this is necessarily a bad game, it's just a long one.  After two and a half hours (4 players), I started to check out.  Usually I'm pretty competitive, but it got to the point that I didn't care anymore.  When the game ended, it was a victory for my morale.  There are plenty of decisions to make, but after a while, it's just more tedious than anything.  If there's a next time, I'll incorporate the dysentery card from Oregon Trail and hope to draw it.

UPDATE:  There will be no next time.  This game is too long and soulless for me.

It has some interesting tempo aspects, and I like how the cards double up as workers. The resource acquisition/conversion is just tedious and it requires a huge amount of planning at the same time.

Finally a game that follows the same vein as 51st State with multi-function cards. It's more of a race than anything, and exhillerating until the end.

There's an interesting counterpoint between the hand management and resource management aspects of the game. You want to rotate through your hand as fast as you can but when you do you also get penalized for carrying over too many resources and Indians. You might try and reduce your resource and Indian load but then each card becomes less efficient. 

One thing is for certain: No two players will play the game the same, at least not until after MANY plays. 

I really love the Dutrait art as well.

This was pitched to me as a deck-builder, which it isn't.  It's a hand-builder, since you always have access to all of your unplayed cards, and then you get all of your played cards back to your hand at the same time.  Odd racing game mostly based around changing cubes into different cubes.  The whole "check your neighbors" mechanic added some interesting interaction, but that's pretty much the only interaction, apart from some light worker placement and drafting denial.  Interesting execution of theme.

Great art work.  Great theme.  I like the resource management and the race element.  The deck building is flawed -- too many cards that a casual or first time player is not going to be able to optimize.  With one play, my group was unable to manage the desk building and the race elements.  Ignoring the cards for the most part and focusing on fast race element (with very frequent encampments) aided by the bump received by players not being able to occupy the same spot, in my only game to date, was a viable and winning strategy.  Would like a home rules version that removes 80% of the cards.

The card drafting/deck building mechanism is an interesting twist on the typical Euro.

3 player game with rules teaching, ends about 1.5 hours. Very distinguished and fresh mechanism, however the downtime between players (as geek suggested, 3 players would be the sweet spot) and somewhat luck dependent make this game can't rise further beyond 8.

Theres a lot going on in this game - But the mechanics are very good - your moves are dictated by the cards you recruit into yopur deck like a true deckbuilder. collect resources and use native americans to boast your cards or to collect stuff in the indian village, worker placement style.

I really like that every card is unique. The game involves a lot of calculating and messing that up can screw up your turn hence the ap issue. Some people complain that certain cards are overpowered. Not sure about that but some cards are supposed to be better than others. With so many cards they will never mesh perfectly. The wife and I really enjoy this one.

Rating 7 after one play. Really nice action optimization puzzle, but a high multi-player solitaire factor and downtime keep it from getting a higher rating for the moment. Might get better with more plays though (the downtime, probably not the MPS). There appear to be different strategies that can all lead to victory, so I'm interested in playing more.

I was expecting a light race game, but L&C is really high on WP strategy. The rules are somewhat confusing the first time through, but it's worth the time to figure out. The number of cards for people you can hire for your expedition gives a lot of replay value. You can't use the same strategy twice in a row. Recommend!

This game is a blast! Theme an mechanics are perfectly presented. The components are top notch: original indian figures, ›special‹ resource tokens, nice and clear iconography, beautiful board and absolute great cards - nice and clear. 

This game has its own unique feel and flow. Sometimes it is a brainer, sometimes it is ›obvious‹ what to do. There are so much decisions to make and there are always multiple options for a good turn. That said, you can bring yourself in a, let me say, very unprofitable situation as well. Always remember it is a race. Do not spend all your effort to build a perfect expedition for future turns - do the great progress just in time. And don´t forget to watch your opponents.

Lewis&Clark scales very well from 1-5 players (i can imagine that 5 players could a bit long and sometimes you have to wait quit long. especially if somebody is prone to ap)

With its solo-variant and the option to change the racetrack with the included river and mountain tokens the replayability is tremendous. Not to forget that every play there are other cards and therefore other card combinations available.

Maeddes likes this game very very much :)

great game

MASSIVE amount of analysis paralysis

but even with all the takesy-backsys that my SO and I do in a two player game we still knock out a game in about an hour.
after a few plays just the two of us we see which cards we like and not and games tend to follow the same trends.  So its lost some of its allure but the game continues to be fun.

Lots of clever play in this one, but it'll take a game or two to really get a good feel for it.  A race game with deck building mixed with a little worker placement.  You have to balance the cards in your hand with the resources and actions you'd like to take, plus you can use your opponents' cards to boost your intake.  Each turn you'll have something new to evaluate.

I had to give this one a second chance, both because my first teacher and group made for a negative experience and because I wasn't impressed with the racing aspect. I never care for race games. On my second play I had a little more experience and I was able to better plan for the mountain pass. I do like how various the methods are to travel and the interaction between the cards and other players. I'm still not sure I like the game, even though I find the mechanics fascinating and the play exciting. What else is there? But somehow it just doesn't coalesce for me. I have no trouble recommending it to others, though: It's a solid, innovative game.

I liked the race concept very much, but it is a very brutal game.  Make a couple of mistakes early on with what cards you obtain to build your deck, and a runaway leader can emerge very easily.  As I make a fair deal of mistakes in most games, I don't find this aspect very fun...

Pure optimisation game and I love it! A real brainburner too since you have to plan 3,4,5 moves ahead to be succesful. I only played this 2 player and it is excellent that way. Not too long after a few plays, maybe a little over an hour. Not to keen to try 4 or 5, but three would be interesting. The game offers a lot of choice and opportunities to try different strategies. The game is beautiful and rich with theme. What's not to love, top 10 game for sure!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Abstract little race game that is overly convoluted, yet also straightforward and thematic. Ultimately, it takes too long for what it is, but decent fun, nevertheless. Will need more plays to make up my mind.

A second play shows indeed that it can be quite quick, but AP, esp. With five, really kills the game. The movement concerning landing on other people and being able to canoe into the mountains is incredibly gamey :(

Nice enough efficiency game though - I like it!

Rating is still in flux, but as a solo game this one is very enjoyable so far. Easy on the eyes and mechanically straight-forward, this mini-deck-builder/worker placement mash-up has a couple of really great ideas going for it- powering up cards in different ways and punishing players for over-building their engine in particular. Looking forward to trying this one in a group soon.

This is a game purchased during a phase of "add to the collection based on time periods/historical premises which are lacking." Luckily in this case, unlike poor 1812 Invasion of Canada (which got sold without ever being played), this game made it to table a few times AND was a good time.

The victory point soup is alive and well here, but the mechanic of spacing in exploration boats adds a lot to the whole endeavor. The Puerto Rico-style eyebrow-raising mechanic, of Native American pieces being "resources" (just like the brown discs are "colonists" in PR, oy vey)... well, that is a bit unfortunate. But the game is still solid.

Love this game.  Great efficiency exercise, lots of good card combos to try out for different strategies.  Enjoy the resource-gathering-from-your-neighbor mechanic (similar to parts of 7 wonders).  Gorgeous artwork, historical tidbits in the rulebook are greatly appreciated and enhance the theme (which was already quite interesting). Don't know why everyone complains about runaway leader issues; so far all the games I've played have had second place only behind by a maximum of three turns, which to me isn't that long.

Can be a tad long when learning.  I think the length comes mostly from AP, which definitely can be an issue, since there are quite a few different things you could do with your turn, and you want to try and plan out each movement/camp cycle perfectly.  However, once everyone knows the game, not so bad at all.

Overall, thoroughly enjoyable, can see me playing this one a lot more in the future.

A játék tele van egyedi mechanizmusokkal (táborozás, indiánok, toborzás), a témáját is tökéletesen ráhúzták a vázra, az összes karakterkártya létező személyről van formázva, tehát minden adott lenne a (közel) tökéletes játékhoz, de valahogy mégsem.

Oké, hogy euró, de hogy a játék 80%-ában A-t váltunk B-re, amiből tudunk majd C-t csinálni és azzal fogunk utána párat mozdulni előre, majd kezdjük újra a folyamatot, nem túl szórakoztató.

Amazing worker placement game. Works really well as a solitaire game which is a huge plus. Great flow, great theme integration… easy to learn, gorgeous components… tons of variety with the various role cards - can't wait to explore different strategic paths. Feels about as meaty as an Uwe Rosenberg game, but in certain ways the flow is better. It's early, but for now this baby is an enthusiastic 10. Just a great game all around. Some have issues with it being a "race" game - frankly, I prefer it to Agricola's complicated end-game scoring. As for solo - the difficulty is easily scalable by trying to beat the game in X amount of moves. 

Update: Pulled it out after not touching it for a while - totally holds up.

Very thematic game with great artwork and components.  I really like how you have to tread a careful line between building up resources and Indians without getting so many that it slows you down when you camp.  I also feel that all of the mechanics really blend well together.  And the randomness of the character cards helps ensure sustained replayability.

My favorite game. I love the variety of ways you can manage your resources and the balance between the Indians, Buying Cards, and Buying expedition upgrades is so much fun. I also love the race aspect. Unfortunately, this game is a little heavy and can be frustrating when first played. You can definitely see moves that you would take back with more experience, and watching people pull away is demoralizing.

It took a few moves to wrap my head around the mechanics of this game, but I really liked it. From what I can see, Lewis & Clark is one of those games that has a pretty steep learning curve - a number of players seemed more likely to get to Cuba than Oregon on the first turn of the game.

Alas, the we didn't get to the end which was a shame as the wheels were starting to come off my 'push ahead early' strategy and the players who had invested in recruiting extra help were starting to reap the rewards of their early decisions. 

Quite a good game and one that I would happily play again, but probably would not purchase.

I love Lewis and Clark.  There are so many interesting and novel aspects to the game.  Even resource collection requires players to think ahead and plan carefully - as you can often take a large quantity of resources, but taking more than you can use will later result in penalties.  When choosing actions, cards have to be played in pairs, so you need to carefully consider what you will be doing in your next few turns each time you play. More than any other game I've played, this game requires precise future-planning.

PROS:
- components, neat meeples

- the card illustrations

- a few neat mechanisms (eg. all workers are neutral, count well how much do you need) and interesting ideas in the card deck

- The game really punishes you for counting things wrong, you lose the position on the "victory river" for anything surplus you had in the moment of recycling your deck. This is what I consider a good thing, euros in general should reward optimization and good thinking.

CONS:
- The overall theme doesn't sell it for me. Some might like the game precisely for the theme, though.

- The among-player interaction (traditionally lower in euros) is not high here, too.  I wouldn't mind that... but generally the player interaction feels very random. I seriously doubt with all my hand management I have to do anyway, I would still have some brain capacity to watch which neighbors-affecting symbols to use and which ones to avoid... One card just has too many  various effects. 

- Every action you plan, every movement on the "victory point river" takes SEVERAL TURRRRNS to launch. Everything here feels slow, especially the deck building.

The last two "cons" might gradually disappear with more plays, but at the moment I'm not rushing into that... :(

Really enjoy this one.  Even after the first game, I started to see there's a variety of possible strategies, and they depend heavily on the character cards that become available -- which differ from game-to-game.

After playing a game for the first time, my wife & I frequently enjoy discussing what other games the new game felt like. For L&C, we said it felt like:

- Dominion, because you are building your 'deck' with new characters... but not exactly, because unlike in Dominion, you can choose exactly when you want to play your cards rather than the cards coming up randomly.
- Stone Age, because there's a worker placement element and the board art is very nice... but not exactly, because worker placement is only a portion of L&C, while it's the entire game in Stone Age.
- Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, because there's that familiar mechanic of new cards becoming available to buy, and sliding down & becoming cheaper over time.

But what's different about L&C from most of our other games is that it's a race game! I really like the fact that it's a race -- and not a victory point collection game, as is the case with most of our games.

I really wanted to like this game more than I did, but it's way too linear and uninspired for my tastes. An enjoyable enough game, but not much replay value, despite what others have said. This game just BARELY misses the mark of being a great game. For whatever reason, this seems to be one of those games that Euro-snobs give a pass to, despite its numerous drawbacks. The answer to the puzzle is always the same, but it's the variables you plug in to get to that answer. I like the worker placement aspect, but the cards seem to come down to who is the most opportunistic. 

Replaced by Rococo.

Great game full of card combos. A bit long for what it deleivers, but i think it was mostly due of not knowing the cards. I enjoyed my first play and eager to play again. I beleive next time, already knowing what to expect, I will be a bit more prepared to the mountains.

The game has a lot of good ideas, like the use of the cards in pairs, creating very interesting decisions, but the one which outstanding the most for me, is the way how the workers move from player to player. Really innovative and tense mechanics this one with the indians. 
3 players seems the right count to this game.

Lewis & Clark is a race game where card management is important. Those are typically two things that turn me off but this game adds some interesting restrictions. Collecting all the cards and resources you can will indeed help you move faster but only to be forced to backwards at the end of the round (when you "camp"). This forces the players to calculate carefully instead of building buffers, perhaps so much that it removes some of the fun from the game. Knowledge of and luck with available cards may also be too important, as some seem more powerful than others. Nevertheless, there is enough in this game to create a tense and entertaining gameplay.

This is one of the best game in Essen 2013. 

The interesting part of the game is you have a lot to decide while the game play is easy. This openness awards creative players that can plan and make a sequence of plays best to move forward. The one-dimensional goal - be the first to reach the destination also makes it much more elegant than recent euros that awards so many endgame bonuses.

The sheer amount of combos also make it very interesting to explore the game mechanisms. The interaction between players is very subtle, and that is a pretty good thing in this type of game - you have enough to consider just with your own cards, so passive interaction is more than enough.

The only downside is having to check the symbols on the cards often (they aren't too easy to figure out) and some players can get AP as it requires a lot of future plannings.

During your turn, your mandatory action includes taking a chracter card action or taking an action in the village, which requires Indians. Optionally, you can recruit more characters or set up camp, which may pull you backwards, but allows you to get all your cards again to use. 

The game has some interesting ideas and you want to create some card combinations that work. The trouble is, setting up camp on the first turn is the only way to play the game strategically. If you don't set camp, you leave your symbols on the table for other people to take advantage, and they will pass you standing still. If you persist in leaving your symbols on the table, your options for plays get weaker, and you might as well set camp anyways. So to be successful, the game becomes an exercise in getting ready for the big push, and limits the variety. Sure there have been a few good suggestions on how to prevent the first turn camp set up, such as adding mountains behind St. Louis. 

Some cards are obviously more powerful than others, and where they show up in the deck does result in some luck. 

The game could probably use a few tweaks to be a good game.

Note: On mid-August 2014, the designer and publisher added a new rule to prevent one from setting camp and falling 5 spaces behind (and no one can use your symbols, while you get to re-use your cards). The rule makes you discard all cards but your starting hand, and limits your resources. It seems like a good rule, and a fix should have been implemented a long time ago, but at least the fix is now part of the official rules. I'm not sure if this will bring the game out of the graveyard for me, but I am willing to try it again.

RATING: 9
Tricky to wrap your head around, with the multiple uses for cards, the use of Indians, the need for a lean expedition, and the desire to actually make progress up the river.  Not easy to play, with meaningful decisions and trade-offs at every step, but very rewarding.
The game rapidly becomes a monster with more players, as the 30 minutes-per-player becomes a 2h+ marathon.  In contrast the included solo rules make a delightful solo puzzle, while the highly recommended fan-supplied [filepage=143838]AutoMacKenzie[/filepage] variant adds variety and tension similar to a multiplayer experience.

the part that got me about the game was how this standered "collect resourse, worker placment" plays out in a race. That was a fun concept. Also the part where you lose your works if they gather resources for you is interesting. Then there is the hand managment part of the game. Really Lews & Clark has something for everyone.

A slow and convoluted race that manages to still entertain.  You really have to pay attention to your card combos, due to how easily you can screw up and move backwards instead of forward.

It is satisfying when the engine actually gets going, but until then it's frustrating-though-still-fun.

Girlfriend likes it, even if it's exasperating the first few turns.

Lewis & Clark is a very Euro version of a Racing game. It uses Set Collection, Deckbuilding, and Resource Management to make your Scout move toward the finish line. An interesting concept, but requires too many conversions to achieve forward motion. Only played the solo variant, but even that took so long that I've no interest in playing L&C with others. There are just better games we could play. Great artwork, but I find the era of L&C dull and uninteresting.

RATING: 8
A unique race game where the theme is Lewis & Clark exploring the North America...and taking advantage of the Native Americans in the process!

I love how the storage mechanism is tough to decide on and awards people that utilize every piece of good every turn before 'resting'.  You are constantly using resources to buy horses, canoes, or use the cards to move yourself along the water and mountainous terrain.

The Indians also give a unique flavor to the game with how you can use them and they get rotated around the players constantly.  

Great race game.

Deceptively tough game that, in many ways, reminds me of Puerto Rico. It's imperative to be aware of what other players are planning to do, there's a distinct arc to it, and it seems like the win hinges on who ends up forcing endgame, or at the very least recognizing when endgame has begun. No wonder it's been rocking the BGG charts.

A worker placement, hand management, racing game.  Huh.  The fact that it doesn't suck on ice speaks volumes; the fact that it's rather good is amazing.  The only randomness comes from a stack of recruitable cards to further augment/build your racing engine.  It's not solvable, but when you figure out how to combo cards to maximum effect the game just... comes to life.

racing game with worker placement and resource collection combined with cards for more efficient resource conversion. eventually resources are converted to movement on either water or mountainous terrain. need to manage leftover resources as well lest they contribute to back movement. lots of combinations contribute to some AP. not a fan of even the simpler variety of racing games...

Not the best with two, but with 4 this game really shines. The game can get really tense even though it at first seems you're cruising into easy victory. Multiple strategies are valid way to victory, which makes this game very good, if not great in my eyes.

The unique card system is very interesting, and the concept of public workers adds some extra timing considerations on top of that. 

Unfortunately, the rest of the game is a simple 'winner takes all' race, which is quite disappointing. Especially considering the inadequate early game camping penalty and the fact that the winner can often be seen a few rounds before the end is triggered.

Strategicamente profondo è un gioco con meccaniche abbastanza originali ma con poca interazione. Il fulcro del gioco sta nella programmazione e pianificazione delle proprie azioni. Ogni giocatore dovrà costruire il proprio motore, mazzo di carte, facendo attenzione a non ingolfarsi la mano. Ogi carta, ogni risorsa e ogni indiano raccolto sul percorso va attentamente ponderato a valutato se necessario, le risorse in eccesso saranno amaramente pagate. Come detto l'interazione non è molto presente e decisamente indirezza, soprattutto nel finale diventa difficile contrastare eventuali fughe del leader anche perché il finale si trasforma spesso in un solitario. A mio avviso tra le migliori novità di Essen 2013, scosiglio di giocarlo in cinque, in virtù dei troppi tempi morti, se tutti non padroneggiano bene il gioco.

The first new game that I've played in quite some time that's really grabbed me. The revolving worker-placement order is a delight of both economy and timing and after a few plays you can iron the whole thing down to barely an hour and a half. Looks like it works superbly with three, but there have sadly been far too many negative comments about component quality.

Very fun game. Many interesting mechanisms that integrate very well and feel in combination quiet new and not like something I've played all over before. I especially enjoy the double usage of the cards as well as the what I would call "preliminary points". Also worker and resource management is interesting in making sure to not only have enough but also not too much. 
I'm not completly sure about long term motivation yet as I'm wondering if availabilty of cards is enough to make it variable enough concerning overall strategy, but for now it's a nice one and the box would actually have some space for expansions. ;)

(Not sure about the solo game yet, tried it once and it was okish but it lacked some of the tension of competing with someone not only in the actual "speed" but also for cards, spots in the village etc. for me)

[i]I have only played this once and initially my thoughts on the game were higher. Now that I look back on the experience I am not sure how often I would want to play this game. I love race games with card play [i](RFtG is a top 5 game for me)[/i], but I want a clean streamlined experience. 

I felt like L & C was made up of a lot of starts and fits. The worker placement element is not nearly as elegant as the rest of the game. It is extremely inefficient to use those spaces to get goods [i](I am specifically referring to canoes and horses)[/i], I don't understand why I can only buy one canoe or horse each turn but it basically kills those spaces. I had bought cards that let me maximize canoes, but then I had to take multiple actions to get multiple canoes. You really need to focus on the cards you get to help you become more efficient with your actions and ignore the allure of the board spaces; then my question becomes why bother including all of the WP elements in this game, it just slows the play way down.[/i]

I liked the mechanics but I can't give this game more then a 2 because of how racist it is. Native Americans being represented by red meeples, I mean c'mon. And that's just the start of. The fact that they're used basically as a currency or resource to spend is terrible. The impression this gives seems like the game designers understanding of of native american tribes is something right out of 1950's cowboy and Indian movies. Indigenous American tribes are a varied people, and the way that this game handles it only perpetuates the misconception that there was only one group of people with one culture.

This game won't get more then a 2 from me. The designers need to learn a thing or two about cultural sensitivity.

Excellent game with a wonderful compilation of historical figures that help you out on your travels! I believe this game is a gateway or medium weight game at heart. But a lot of thought has to go into preparing your band of boats to make their journey up the river and mountains. So because of this, games tend to last a good while, even with just 2 players. The mechanics are really very innovative and fun to work out as you play. 

In this game you have a hand of cards which every turn you will take one to use for it's action and another of your cards to use for it's Native American workers. You also will have the option to recruit other Indians to  assist in your actions. Turns are very simple. You play a card and have the option to recruit another historical figure to help you on your journey (a card to add to your hand). Your cards are your most powerful options every turn, but you do have the option to send your Indian helpers to town to get goods and services for you. 

The game is essentially a race to the Pacific coast. The first to cross the flag space wins. The combined use of your collection of cards and the worker placement part of the game really make this game unique and fun to play. It is strategic, but so simple that I feel many new players can pick it up quickly and play easily. Especially since the rule book is so well organized with examples and it is written very well.

I played this mostly on a whim, hoping for something "not awful". So the fact that this is really quite an astonishing design effort blew me away. 

At heart a race game, with deck building, worker placement and resource conversion elements. There are also significantly important timing and leeching elements reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy (in that taking advantage of what your opponents do can help you along a lot). All of these things come together in a way that not only feels fresh, it feels like a ton of game with not much rules density. That might be what I find most amazing - this is the kind of game that, in less skilled design and development hands, could easily have collapsed into a confused mess of mechanisms that work at cross purposes, instead of a game that feels like more than the sum of its parts. 

Highly recommended. Along with Ludonaute itself, which has now released two of my favourite games from the past year (this and Little Prince).

This game is an AP nightmare. So many decisions, so many different strategies forward for very little reward. The mechanics of the game are solid but there are just too many options for players to have a clean turn.

Unique but not play-tested enough to eliminate some of the frustrating AP.

A 2 hour exercise in tedium. Sure, it has lots of solid Euro mechanic staples with a few twists so it at least provides something a bit novel. Sure, it works just fine. But really you're playing the same game about 7 or so times. Collect resources as efficiently as your neighbours allow (you can clone the resource icons they've used recently), convert into stuff that allow you to move. Move as far as you can, and when you're close to running out your deck set your camp to where you've moved to. End mini-game 1. Start again. Gather. Move. Camp. End mini-game 2. And so on. You can save some resources for next turn, but the more you save, the less your camp gets to move forward, so it's inefficient to prepare too much for the following mini-game. You can buy some souped up cards to allow you to gather and move more efficiently, but not too many cards as that prolongs each of your mini-games (as cards in hand also restrict moving your camp forward). So get a bit of soup and process, re-set, re-process, repeat, lather, rinse, repeat, ad-nauseum for 2 hours until someone thankfully wins. Now it's not all that bad, I've given it a 6 after all, but I guess people are liking it because there are different ways to set up your mini-game efficiency engine and try them out based on the cards that are available to buy and add to your hand (there's a whole bunch of luck there as well in what comes up when it's your turn and you can afford to buy). There's nice decisions as to how you want to power up your actions (you can use cards and/or workers to ramp up each action). And there's tactical stuff on how to take advantage of what other people have just done. But they're all minor variations on a theme. And speaking of theme, where's the EXPLORATION STUFF!!! It's a race game ... build an engine, process that engine, with tactical deviation to take advantage of what's left you, but process that engine. I'm really not sure I want to do that X times for 2 hours too often.

The game looks beautiful no doubt about that.

A few too many options and interactions between the gameplay elements for me making it daunting for the first (and 2nd, 3rd?) time player. Then within each are you have yet more options (50 cards - really? how long to even know what's there never mind assess the interaction?).
The game requires a lot of planning and there's a frustration of I want to do x, then y then z and I only get to do one thing this turn but it seems slow (maybe that's the other players, but it feels like the game).

I think this would shine when everyone playing has 5 or so games under their belt but I just don't see that ever happening for me and I'm not sure I want to go through the journey of getting there.

Glad to have tried it and I'd play it again but removed from my want to buy list

Based on one play: The rules appear quite simple but once you get into it the interplay is very well designed. You play cards in sets or send people to gather resources or covert them with your main goal of moving up river and building camp. The mechanics are well thought out and the game length is reasonable, but it's one of those games where you always want it to be your turn as you can easily plan ahead.

Lewis & Clark is a race game, but it doesn't feel like one.  You play a card from your hand to determine your action for the the turn, whether that be moving, collecting resources, gathering indians, etc.  However, to get your cards back you have to camp, at which point you'll have to move backwards if you have too many resources, indians, or cards in your hand.  During the course of the game, you can acquire new and better cards, but you have to be careful that that doesn't make your hand even harder to manage.  This is a game that rewards careful multi-turn planning, so you end up with exactly as many resources you need, no more and no less.

I'm still undecided on how I feel about this game. It's like a really slow race. The card interaction is fun and the cards you can acquire can be interesting, but I'm never excited during this game. It also can be absolutely AP prone at times. The pieces are not the best quality as everything is starting to warp. Card are very warped, but still perfectly playable and the board has flattened out.

Edit: So I re-read the rules after not having played this game for a VERY long time. I missed one (somewhat) important rule for the game. You can trash a card from your hand and apply the equipment cost on the back of the card towards the purchase of new card. Maybe I was playing it correctly, but I don't recall that rule. Now it may not affect my rating entirely or even have that much of a game play change, but it is rather important and I'd like to play this again after trying it correctly. I'll re-rate the game again after trying. Currently it's a 5 BEFORE playing the correct way.

Update: So I played it correctly and solo. Playing it with the corrected rule did improve the game, but not significantly. Solo was fine, better than I expected, but it's literally just a timer for the game and it feels more like an optimization puzzle. I don't think my rating will change. Still looking for this game to go to a better home. I've given it plenty of chances to emerge now.

But the last part of the game was really boring: everybody just cycled through his deck, nobody was interested in the new cards anymore and the game was at least 30 minutes too long to stay fun.

Wanna replay to get a better idea, but then with a maximum of 3 players.

Updated 18/06/2014: Played with 2. Much better as downtime is far less off course and I never got bored this game. Still, once you are satisfied with your deck, you just keep cycling through it until you reach the end goal. 

Still, after 2 games, I don't understand the hype/very high rating of this game. For me this is an OK game to have, but not a must have.

In a lot of ways, this is just another soulless euro-style game. The only interesting decision is deciding which order to play cards and take actions, which you can relatively safely do at the start of each round. So the game play certainly isn't challenging, and you don't feel like much of an explorer

Themeless boring crappy game. 

This game just has too many brain burning options, feels like too much to do just to move up the river little by little. It feels like working goshh, so boring and agonizing.

Too many different types of cards you have to look up at first. Love the artwork and components but it just did not click with us. Also, the re-playability of this game must be pretty poor as it just feels the same every time after 2-3 games, which is a huge problem.

The game is just too long for what it is and it drags on and on. I mean we are suppose to move along a river right ?! How hard is it to paddle compare to what we are doing in this game. The theme just wasn't there. Nobody belived that they were in a race paddling on a boat... O_o

It's a bunch of mechanics thrown together and falsely calls it a race... yeah right !!

Bad bad game !!

A resource-conversion puzzle/game with a few novel (to me) features: 

*To gain resources or convert to better ones generally involves playing a pair of character cards, one to signify the resource type and the other flipped (and tucked under the first) with a multiplier icon (Red Indian) allowing the collecting/converting to be done 1, 2 or 3 times.  You can max up to 3 times by placing 1 or 2 Red Indian meeples from your expedition board. If you don't have a second character card you can use your meeples. (You gain more -unique- character cards by drafting at varying costs) 

With resource collection you count each time how many tabled cards match your desired resource, including your opponent(s) tableau (a la 7 Wonders) then multiply. 

So timed right you can scooped a lot, however this bounty needs to placed on your expedition board with limited space (you can buy-with resources-to expand your board), but the main consideration is the goods can slow the progress expedition party, which brings me to the focus of the game part: Be the first player to get your expedition party from the East side to the West side of the US.

*A lot of resource-conversion puzzle/games I've played is all about victory points, a fractured, scattered means of conveying status. Refreshingly in L & C status is simply done by moving a scout meeple up river and over mountains, again by means resource conversion via paired cards. However, like in 80 Days the status may be an illusion because when you decide to pick up your tabled cards, your scout has to go back a number of spaces determined by the weight the expedition carries and how many character cards in your hand at the time of your decision.

*Enhancing deck and resource management there is worker placement involving the multitasking meeples in the middle of the board, with some spots only allowing one meeple, reminding me of Stone Age

So in all a mix of familiar mechanics with some novel ones, with the visual race making me prefer this over types such as Agricola. The fact L & C can be played solo has kicked Agricola out to pasture. I wonder if 1 or 2 players may be the sweet spot as there is no  resource market competition or trading to maintain non-player interest, and although the different character cards provide some variation overall it is a humourless venture maybe best done alone.

OMG. An extremely boring exercise of changing this into that and then changing it into something else, so that my little meeple on the track can move ahead. A totally abstract puzzle with a paste-on topic. I was totally bored after the first 20 minutes. Might play Sudoku instead next time. And if someone is interested - I even won my first and also last playing of that tiresome game ...

Scores high for its uniqueness, but so far I have only really seen one strategy win.  Sacagawea is certainly overpowered, and I'm a little concerned too much might depend on identifying such strong cards early and pouncing on them before other players realize the same thing.  Good replayability and player interaction, though, as long as you play with the revised rules concerning falling back from St. Louis.

This game has that quick 'build your engine' thing that I normally like, but since it's a racing game, there are a lot of cool things to do, but all you SHOULD do is set up one or two good combos and then flog them repeatedly. The card playing mechanic is similar to Concordia, but in any given round you use half your cards for their actions and half to boost the strength of the first half. So what is it that makes this less interesting? It might be the lack of victory points. Getting your camp to the end is a win and that's that. It's an intellectual distinction, since I've played and enjoyed score track games that end when a player reaches X points, but I feel it here. There are also so many cool things, it seems a shame to force players to be tight with their decks.

An interesting worker placement/race game with some clever mechanics. 

I'd say that it's a bit heavy on the tactical end, but you shouldn't let yourself spend too much time thinking about your moves if you want to actually have fun with this game. 

The Native American meeples are super-racist, but somehow that is acceptable within the context of the game (because we all know that Lewis and Clark were't good people). Don't let your hand get too big or you'll suffer.

Ez egy jól ősszerakott, letisztult, light gamer játék. Munkás lehelyezés, pakliépítéssel, sok interakcióval, de mégis kevés konfrontációval. Nem annyira súlyos, mint egy Vinhos, vagy egy Terra Mystica, de úgy gondolom mindenképpen kell hozzá 2, de inkább 3 játék, hogy megmutassa magát, és eltűnjön a kezdeti káosz. Így nem árt némi türelmesség a játékhoz, annak ellenére, hogy már elsőre is látszólag könnyen érthető játékmenete van. Itt nem érdemes 1 játék után itélkezni. Nagyon jó az 1 fős játék is, főleg az elején. Nálam jelenleg minden szempontból veri a Stone Age -et, igaz, annál kicsit komolyabb, ráadásul a kocka dobálást is mellőzi a játék.

RATING: 6
This is a great looking game with some serious deck and resource management. This makes playing the game very calculating because in this race game you really want to count every step. Progress in the mountains requires different resources than going forward at a river. And this carefull planning can be big fun.
A player's turn can be very fast or it can be very slow. The high number of cards, all with unique characters add atmosphere to the game. Unfortunately a bit too many of these cards come with unclear iconography.
Having played the game now twice, once with four and with five. I think the game plays greater with fewer numbers as there can be too much downtime as in between your turns there is hardly anything going on what may influence you.

RATING: 9
Love this game. Very intense resource management where you need to utilise a number of different resources to build canoes and horses to race (first one there wins) from one side of America to the other. All without incurring progress penalties (you get moved back for holding too many resources and not playing all of your characters)! Because building and moving the canoes/horses has a lot of steps involved, there is a lot of planning needed as you decide which resources to get this turn, which character card or villager to use to get them and which new character card to get each turn.

You need to compete for the different characters with resources. These characters come out in random order each game from a deck, so this varies the strategy you will be able to use each game. Another nice twist.

Juggling all that makes for a very challenging and interesting game. And the artwork is very nice. Would look very good on the shelf!

Took me some time to write this comment, but at least I can honestly say "Lewis & Clark" is a great game. Still, it should be mentioned that I've never tried it with more than two - we love this one with my wife & that's how we play it. 

But to the point. "Lewis & Clark" is a 100% eurogame. The theme is fine and the art amazing, but I never feel immersed in the world. In other words, it's just an exercise in optimization - something I personally love! There's some deck building here, some resource conversion - standard fare, as eurogames go. But it all creates a great feel of a real race. There are no points here, just be the first on the finish line and you've won. I like it - it feels fresh and makes the overall situation on the board transparent. You always know who's winning and who's probably out of contention, which can be both good and bad. I've heard complaints of huge downtime, but in 2p game it's not a problem. 

Overall, "Lewis & Clark" is a great game for all euro lovers. It's thinky and very replayable. Creating overpowered combos brings smile to your face, and while interaction is on a lower level (comes down to snatching a great card faster or denying your opponent resources), I wouldn't call it solitaire. Wife bought it for me as a birthday present, cause she loved the art, and the game never disappointed - turns out sometimes you CAN judge a game by its cover!

This game drips with history, which I love. Components really well designed and the artwork is incredible--lovely to look at. Rulebook is well done. However the 30 minute/player estimate is laughable. Our first game, in which we learned the rules, took 5 hours for two players. There are so many possible choices, which is complicated by the fact that you can only take one action per turn and turn planning can be upset by the other players' actions--your careful plan for the next three turns can be destroyed by the time your turn comes around, meaning you'll have to start over planning. Downtime and AP will be a problem with more players. It's possible that opening moves and strategic lines will become apparent with more play, which would shorten game play. Until then, I would not try this with more than three players unless they already knew how to play.

A tight engine building game which a great sense of style. I enjoy the variety of helpers available for hire and being forced to work with some less-than-ideal cards. Getting your expedition to the mountains is easy, but being prepared to cross them is a different story, not to mention doing it all again once you get through. Sometimes the game can go long, especially if players are poor planners, but eventually someone will shoot ahead. Not the most climactic of endings most of the time, but a tight race can be quite a thrill. This one is a keeper.

Lewis & Clark is very tactical Euro game with card drafting and hand management as the major mechanism. L&C features the currently very popular twist of different uses of a single card: you can either play the card for its effect or use it to "activate" other cards. Typical for a Euro game there is a lot of ressource conversion and also some worker placement. Hording a lot of ressources does not work here, since this will make you lose some progress on the journey track. I enjoy very much that you have to reduce anything to the absolutely necessary for your expedition. Although this is an almost abstract mechanism, it conveys the thematic feeling of an expedition very well.

I like about L&C that it is a race game with a clear objective. Unlike gaining VP for arbitrary actions, you have to find a way to effectively move up the river and through the mountains. Judging the available cards how you could utilize them to reach this goal is very entertaining. The game has a unique art-style and a beautiful map; I like if map and action spaces (Indian village) blend well into each other. 

There is very little player interaction and the label "Mulitplayer Solitaire" fits very well to L&C. But in this category it is among the best (depending on if you put Rosenberg's games in this category as well) and offers a very unique mix of different mechanisms. As there is only little interaction and each additional player adds some downtime, I think this is a very good 3 player game, still OK with 4, but should be avoided with 5.

I have the suspicion that the hanging back strategy (hoarding ressources and getting two boats in the beginning, but only move back 5 spaces from St. Louis) is very powerful and could be exploited (play cards and immediately rest), such that others will not benefit from your tableau. Further plays will show, if this is true. But even if this is a case, there are quite a few fixes for that (see this  [article=15256280]thread[/article]). [i]Update: With a gentlemen's agreement that you do not set camps in consecutive rounds while falling behind St. Louis (i.e. 3rd solution proposed in the thread), I do not think this to be a problem any more. Update2: Now that there is an official fix ([url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1138777/can-hang-back-and-tech-strategy-be-beaten/page/4]link[/url]) for the hang back strategy, this should be no problem anymore.[/i]

Just a great experience with this historical euro game that throws in a splash of unique deck building.  I love the pull between strategy and tactics.  Your strategy seems upfront but the tactics comes in when you opponent goes and then there seems to be bargain.  there is almost an outwit your opponent aspect in the case.   Furthermore, the integration of the theme within the euro mechanic is great each aspect whether recruiting people or Indians or uses of resources they all really make sense and you get the feeling of building a caravan as you go.  All the strategy and tactics mix can create a situation conducive to AP and downtime so I wouldn't recommend this with more than 3 players unless you don't mind the downtime.  I would say this probably plays best with 2.  Anyway, just a fun venture and I look forward to trying it solo and playing more in general. 

Update:  there is really quite some variance to win this.  Two games, two completely different strategies both resulting in wins. It's really about finding a strategic engine based on the recruits that come up and then tactically tweaking that plan as more recruits come up but then you might decided to get rid of recruits and time can be crucial. There can be a real deck molding aspect to this game that I did not explore on my first play.

Spiel Essen 2013 buy. Not sure what all the hoopla was about regarding the 'thinness' of the cards; I have no problems with them but appreciate my spare set of 'thicker' cards that I got for free in Essen.

First gameplay was a bit meh, but I liked my second play a bit better. Third play was even better. It probably does help that all my plays of this game are only two-player.

This is a good game, but really really thinky, and it gets more thinky as the game progresses. Because it has so many options, it can induce severe analysis paralysis, especially in later turns.

The game system contains many interesting elements not seen in any other boardgames. You need to collect optimal amount of resources, optimal number of cards and time your actions in most optimal way, also the Native American-worker system is weird, in a good way. Overall the game is unique combination of different elements that creates an interesting racing game experience. I biggest downside is probably that I would only play this a 2-3-player game. If everybody has played at least once, I could try the 4-player game. 5-player game is just pure madness in any case.

One of the most interesting of the new games we got for Christmas 2013 (and we were very lucky to pick up a copy from a friend who happens to run a local store - everywhere else in the UK seemed to sell out within half an hour of getting their copies). A race game, powered by a combination of worker placement and deckbuilding - it manages to give a real feel of managing an expedition, in terms of judging when your people have outlived their usefulness and are now just slowing you down, and whether you should overload yourself with resources that you may not be able to use for a while.

The most interesting mechanic is that, although I mentioned deckbuilding, there is no luck of the card draw - all new cards gained go directly to your hand, where they remain until played. Also that each card needs another card (or some of your precious "workers") to be played with it in order for it to have any effect, so you constantly have to judge how to best use your cards. All in all, this is one of the most interesting and original games of recent years - while I haven't fallen in love with it on my 3 plays so far, I have found it intriguing and will certainly enjoy my future plays. But it's a real brain-burner, and even though I personally like brain-burners, this is not one I think I'd want to play every week. (And actually, we've not played for ages, and of course we've acquired several waves of shiny new games since then - L&C is I think too good, or at least too novel with much still to explore, to deserve to be totally forgotten about.)

Não me diverti com o jogo, mas pensando a respeito dele, acho que merece mais partidas. O problema pra mim é que o jogo alia uma mecânica muito diferente de uso das cartas e dos meeples, com a qual você tem que se acostumar nas primeiras rodadas, com as cartas de deckbuilding, que são todas diferentes e fazem entrar informação nova no jogo toda rodada. Sendo que essa informação é colocada numa iconografia de difícil leitura.

Isso atrapalhou bastante a fluidez do jogo e consequentemente a diversão. Se jogar ele de novo em breve, a mecânica não vai ser mais um problema, a iconografia vai ficar mais fácil e as cartas vão ser mais familiares. Vou conseguir raciocinar o jogo sem precisar lutar para entender o jogo. E aí, acho que vamos gostar bem mais.

O que não significa que ele não tenha problemas: o principal pra mim é o pula-carniça que faz uma jogada de um movimento virar uma de cinco. Se isso for tão presente como o trem da alegria da partida que joguei, meio que transforma um jogo bem cerebral num troço meio zoeira.

(+) Beautiful artwork
(+) Like the mechanism in which you can empower cards by 'sacrificing' others - yet all cards recycle. Gives interesting dynamic near the end of the game
(+) Some nice engine-building aspects
(+) Mechanism fits to the theming: building a big expedition with lots of resources grants opportunities, but may cripple your expedition

(-) Some players drop out of the race well before the game ends -> sometimes leads to some lousy end game situations

This game just has too many brain burning options, feels like too much to do just to move up river a little. Too many different types of cards you have to look up at first.

This is a race game where you race over land and water. You have a scout, who does the racing and a base camp that keeps track of your last location. Although this is not a deck builder per se, you can add cards to your deck to improve your selections. You keep playing cards from your hand until you decide to camp. However, when you camp, you can end up going backward if you have too much stuff or cards in your hand.
While parts of this game are interesting, what put me off is that you need to do a myriad of things and this results in moving a few spaces.
I felt like I was asking a girl to dance and she told me first I had to do fifty pushups, run three laps around the room, stand on my head, then do the Curly shuffle before she'd dance with me.
Not in my future acquisition plans.

It's a solid game. Fun to make combos. The one thing I didn't like was that near the end of the game, buying cards is mostly useless and you're mostly on autopilot just running your deck that you built. 

The beginning is very fun setting up a good engine but I didn't have as much once it was up and going.

13-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Heavy game in which you try to balance playing action cards and workers (indians) to travel towards some Fort. Fun twist, workers are a communal resource and you are punished by not making most of your resources, as they take delay you in traveling symbolised by moving backwards :). Camping moves your camp and 'saves' your progress, you cannot move back farther than 2 behind your camp. Fun, but a little too heavy for me :).

Really enjoying this one.  The card play and hand building reminds me a lot of another recent game, Concordia, and the board play/resource conversion reminds me of Stone Age, but the theme is stronger here than either of those as well as trying to build your hand engine.  A lot of depth to explore here.

Update: The "camping for unlimited backsteps behind the start" strategy kind of ruins the game for me.  Without a house rule to prevent this as a viable strategy, I'm not really interested in playing this again. Really disappointed with this one.

Lewis and Clark is a fun game where players play the roles of explorers leading an expedition from St Louis up the Missouri river to the pacific Ocean. Players play cards to collect resources and Indians in order to obtain the necessary resources to lead the expedition and advance up the river. Players must expand there expedition efficiently or else lose time in the race to the pacific ocean. 

Pros: Great Historical tie with actual characters from the Lewis and clark expedition. Beautiful Artwork. Unique game play and  quite engaging with the theme. Fairly Simple gampeplay rules

Cons: Very long game(Do not play with more than 2 or maybe 3 Players. Many decisions make decision making overwhelming. Not for any indecisive players.

Enjoyed the first play, skeptical how interesting further plays will be. Will wait to rate until I can play a few more times.

I won, because halfway through the game I stopped proceeding and just sat there buying cards while my opponent kept advancing, thinking she was winning. Once I had my engine, I raced the rest of the way to the end.

Liked: Simple winning mechanism vs other worker placement games, the option to choose between worker placement and engine building mechanics, being able to use shared resources.
Disliked: the card back and front look too similar, when you are constantly playing cards face up and face down. It makes it harder to look through your hand and make decisions. Less superficially, the game does feel a bit too much like several games put together. While the system interact, you can almost choose to play primarily with the worker placement mechanism, or primarily as an engine builder. Balance between those feels like it might be off.

RATING: 5
The game itself is yet another tedious optimization puzzle in the form of worker placement and trading resources, all of which are hexagons instead of more thematic shapes.  The layout is annoyingly subpar, with cryptic iconography on cards that requires rulebook referencing to understand, tiles that don't fit their designated spaces, and a quick reference that is on the penultimate page of the rulebook instead of the back, which is instead an ad for the very game you're playing.  Add to that a problematic theme of named and pictured white people racing to the Pacific while "Indians" are indistinct expendable meeples, and I have no desire to play this again over any of the games I actually find enjoyable.

RATING: 10
Easy to learn, but quite the brain burner. A mostly tactical game that requires players to respond to cards as they become available for in-game purchase. The hand management mechanic is brilliant and rewards efficiency (it is a race game after all). 

The map and card art looks great, but cards are thin and rather poor quality compared to modern board gaming standards. Definitely sleeve the cards, even though they won't get shuffled much. 

I noticed some complaints about the length of this game. For us this has almost become a meaty filler due to how fast it goes. As a 2 player game we can reliably be done in under 45 minutes.  

Update: This is one of the best (if not the best) board games that I own as far as game play is concerned, but probably the worst game I own as far as the quality of the board is concerned. I have tried hard to cajole my warped board into some semblance of a flat shape, but without much success.

One of the most beautiful games I own.  The theme is outstanding throughout the game, both in its overall objective to push your camp forward in exploration, as well as including all the people that Lewis & Clark met and helped along the way.  Also, the mechanic of how the cards are used is really intriguing.  Add in a little worker placement and you have a really outstanding game!

RATING: 8
Very good game with the hand management and resource generation and unique card play. I read the rules and then became really interested in the history behind the expedition. Also, the game play, character names, and actions in general really seem to capture a feel for the story.

However, this isn't a game if you want to see some quick progress. It's a lot of work to build up enough stuff to move forward, similar supposedly to the real trip taken up the river and through the mountains. In addition, we played with 5 people, some of which are fairly new to gaming, so it took a long time and the route gets pretty crowded.

Regardless, I much prefer this with 2 players instead of 5. It not only moves a bit quicker, but gives some more freedom along the path to not step on each other as much.

Lewis and Clark is a racing game with lots of hand management and hand building considerations. I feel like I should like it more than I do in practice, and it feels pretty hard to play well. Making a mistake in planning can be extremely costly in a way that makes the game slightly more stressful than I like. The end game is anti-climactic, and it's often clear who is going to win (or lose) quite a while before the game concludes. The way that setting camp works feels like a clunky, awkward way to institute efficiency considerations, and the worker placement element feels bolted on.

A good, solid twist on deck/hand-building.  I like how the timing of when you camp can clear the table of icons, thus jamming someone if they were hoping to piggy-back on you.  There is definitely some cool stuff going on here.  It's a race game, so the last couple of turns seemed like they could be academic if someone has a big enough lead, but it was certainly better than I expected.

Played once with 4P during the BGC Retreat 2014. Lewis & Clark is a pseudo-racing game which involves a clever mechanism of hand management. It is clever because you have to pair up cards in your hand to an optimum effect, while considering the cards your opponents have already played down. The cards you play are mostly used to gather resources, which are then converted into movement on the expedition track.

While the game has some clever ideas, I can't help but feel that it is a bit too convoluted for its own good. It's also a little prone to downtime as your plans can be scuttled when your opponent decides to set up camp and eliminates resources you thought you would have during your turn. Also, the game runs a little long due to this downtime. I would love to get another game in some time to justify this rating.

[6 plays] After the first play I came away with lots of ideas on how to approach the next play. I think there is a lot a variability in ways to achieve success. Now, after the third game, I see that this is true. Hand management, selecting some good character cards, and paying attention to the fundamentals are all components of a successful strategy.

Beautiful artwork, thematically relevant, and decent pacing with 2 or 3 players. I think it will be equally fun, but slower with 4 players. I expect 5 players to have too much downtime and confusion/crowding/chaos.

Played once at GenCon 2013 with a friend; rules overview was provided by Anne-Cécile from Ludonaute.  This is a worker-placement game with some deck-building, but doesn't not involve and victory points!  What?! Instead, this is a racing game where players compete to be the first to traverse the river and mountains to be the first to reach the West Coast.  While moving along the river and over the mountains is what has to be done to win the game, there are many different combinations of resources that allow the necessary movement depending on the members you have recruited into you expedition. For example, the starting cards make it obvious that canoes are necessary to move on water and you get those by using wood. However, later cards will allow you to "trade" with the Indians, so all of a sudden horses or meat can be traded for canoes. Similar things can happen with crossing mountains. The cards are all shuffled and come out in a random order each time, so there will be a different mix each time.  

This is an innovative game design.  My play was 2-player and I really enjoyed it. It was very tense and it's always good to be able to watch what the other player is doing and try to adjust or mess with him. Based on the length of the play though, I'd probably keep this at 2 or 3 players.

SOS Titanic and Lewis & Clark were the two best games that I played at GenCon 2013. They will be instant buys for when they are released (sadly, there weren't any copies for sale at GenCon).

This game you can tell that it's well designed. Everything mechanically makes sense and works together in harmony. It's a brain burner for sure so only play with the right people. This game is geared towards people who enjoy optimizing their moves, figuring out a puzzle and crossing the finish line in this intense race. Please do not play with more than 3 players. I think 1 - 3 is the only player count it's designed for. It has a bad reputation for being too long and I think it's because people have tried playing it at 4 - 5 which shouldn't have been written on the box.

Fun game. I love trying to solve the puzzle of the cards you get in your hands. The art on each of the 84 cards is magnificient and I love looking at them and the board.
Bonus mention for the 6-card crews which are made of different characters for each player, all crew having the same starting skills (different artwork, names and background in the rulebook).

Update from 2017/02/20

Great game all around. Each game represents an inspiring puzzle with 3 main objectives to organize and establish a strategy: resource collection, travelling and acquiring character cards with the best possible timing. Upgraded from 9.1 to 9.2

I'm a sucker for a good worker placement, resource management, card drafting, engine building game, but not usually a racing game!  These mechanics work together in a way that it doesn't feel like your typical euro. I have won two games and had my butt handed to me in another.  In all three games I saw inefficient decisions I had made, which will keep me coming back for more. I don't see this game leaving my collection any time soon.

I really liked my play of this, and the rating will likely go up, but I'd like to play it again before finalizing it.

The theme is good in this one, and the mechanic for moving up the river and then being forced to camp based upon your efficiency (or lack thereof) is quite interesting. I like how the Indians are effectively a closed economy, and also how you collect helpers that over time help you out. Trying to hold out before you camp makes also for an interesting added decision.

RATING: 7
2 plays, 4er

This is a pretty cool hand management deck-building (sort of) game where you race down the river, cross mountains here and there, and try to cross the finish line fastest. You have to remember it's a race, and not get caught up in acquiring all the cool cards (every card in the deck is unique!). But you do have to acquire something to help you along, then make most efficient use of it. Sort of like Ascension, with the constantly changing display, but you only acquire a few cards and then spend the rest of the time actually using the deck. I think?

I would like to play this again, even though it took quite some time. I think it should be faster with repeated play, and probably better with just 2 or 3 players.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have a camp marker and scout token starting at one end of the river. 

Everyone starts with the same deck of cards, each of which allow a different type of action: collect one of 4 basic resources, call a Pow Wow (collect Indian tokens from the board), convert basic resources to advanced goods, move your Scout down the river by paying some combo or resources, etc. The backs of these show 1-3 Indians: when playing a card, play another face down as well (and/or add Indian tokens) -- the number of Indians is the number of times you can take that action. On your turn, you take one action -- either playing card(s) to your display, or spending an Indian meeple to take an action on the board. Many actions have you looking at icons in your display and/or that of your neighbors' displays.

You can also buy one new card from the card row, adding it to your hand.

Eventually, you'll make camp: move your Scout backwards down the river a number of spaces depending on how many cards remain in hand, and goods/Indians remain in storage. Advance your camp marker to your Scout's new position. Then return all cards (and Indian tokens) from your display to your hand (and personal storage board). The first player to set camp past the finish line wins the game immediately!

This is a racing game and probably my favorite racing game I've played.  I'm not usually a fan of racing games but this one has a lot of other game mechanics mixed in.  Along with the racing mechanics that dictate the actual goal of the game the gameplay is made up of hand management, role selection, and worker placement.

In this game all players are explorers trying to make it up the river and set up camp at or past the finish line first.  They do this by playing different cards from their hands to collect different resources and take actions that move them up river.  There are also "Indian" meeples that are placed on board spaces in worker placement fashion.  After cards are played from your hand they remain out of your hand until you set up camp to take back all your cards.  This also sets up camp at the position you have moved down the river but first you have to lose time based on the boats you have filled and cards remaining in your hand.  This makes for some interesting decisions since you need to balance the efficiency of your actions with how much time you lose when setting up camp to take all your cards back.

The one problem I can see though is with one of the main reasons I don't care for a lot of racing games.  The first person to cross the finish line wins immediately and there is no bonus given to players who go after the starting player.  This means the player(s) who go earlier in turn order have a distinct advantage.  There are certain cards that alleviate that but those cards won't necessarily come out or be available to the later acting players.  The game should also be played with larger player numbers since many of the cards in the game are artificially handicapped when playing with just 2.

I still greatly enjoyed this game.  I like worker placement and varied powers but the potential imbalance in a game that ends this way worries me.  I may lose a lot of this enthusiasm for the game if I notice this in a future play.

RATING: N/A
Like in every race game there's something that turns me off. It's not a problem of the game it's my own feeling about these kinds of games. Mainly because once you get to learn how to explore the map and deal with its difficulties, like surpassing the mountains and which cards are of better use to do so, you get the whole picture and then you have the pure race game with no more surprises, like you do when you're playing for the first time. It's like playing Pandemic. Once you figure out which powers you should use and when, then you have a boring game.
In Lewis and Clark, although there is much more complexity than in an average race game, players seem to learn sooner or later the best way to play it and suddenly, all the charm and fun vanishes.
But it is a cool game and it certainly has its merits. I'm sure there are lots of people cheering for this game but unfortunately I'm not one of them. Once again, it's more like my personal distaste than a game problem.

Lots to like from my first (three) plays.

Theme integration, a simple victory objective, simple mechanics which allow players to create their own strategic path, some player interaction (timing of scout movement, Indian placement, timing of resource collection).

What stops it being simply an efficiency recycling and repeat exercise is the mountains and the timing of scout movement. 

3 is max number i would play with (unless everyone knew the game) as there is some down time.

After I read the rules I have to admit I didn't want to play. The game seemed unintuitive, messy, and unnecessarily complicated. While I still think it's not the most intuitive game, this really is a great game. 

It's hard for me to articulate exactly what makes this game good. I really like that the game isn't a point salad game where you don't really ever know how well you are doing in relation to the other players. I like that there are so many different options and paths to victory. No turn ever feels wasted because there is so much that you need to accomplish and no right way to pursue it.

Feel slightly uncomfortable that Indians are used as resources and that they are represented by red meeples. But all the people in the game, including Indians, have names and bios. So the game does a good job in being really careful about what could be a sensitive issue. 

The beautiful presentation tries to mask the fact that the mechanics are not very thematic or intuitive. It frequently brought me in and out of the game similar to how a bad movie script can take you in and out of the movie. 

All in all a tense game with a lot of decisions to make, but a bit thematically detached which makes the experience kind of jarring.

This is a fun game with lots of interesting gameplay that develops based on the cards that come out, as well as your other players.

That said, it is too long and too chaotic with 5.  The gameboard, available actions, change too much between your turns to formulate a real strategy, so your gameplay becomes very tactical.  For a game this long, tactical is *not* particularly fun.

I think the sweet spot is 2-3, with 4 players being ok, and 5 being a poor experience.

Some theme play.  Game fairly easy to learn and play, but will take a couple of plays to grasp strategies.  Game combines many mechanics such as worker placement and deck building, but each mechanic is used sparingly.  Components are excellent - colorful mounted board, thick cardboard chits, plastic playing pieces, and durable linen cards.  Artwork is above average.  Game time is long and starts to drag, but may improve with more plays.

[Asmodee 2014 second edition] {Exploration; worker placement, deck-building, racing; scalable} Lewis & Clark is a very good game - it is thematic, engaging and fun.  The game mechanics meld together seemlessly.  I love this game.

This game is particularly refreshing because we don't burn our brains with convoluted scoring rules.  This game is simple - just be the first one to set up a camp at the goal line.

The game components are good. I love the illustration of cards - pretty and thematic.  The game would even be more perfect if shaped tokens are used instead of the vanilla wood cubes - actually, the choice of color is confusing and I can't understand why pink is food, etc.

The replayability of this game is very good.  The randomness of character cards and the varaible set up of the route.

The rulebook is well illusrated and written.  It is easy to understand the core mechanics easily.  I wish player aid cards are provided and a reference sheet (in A4 size) for all character cards.  It is so clumsy to check the rulebook for the functions of character cards.

Captures the feel of the struggle traveling across the country very well. People and goods help you travel, but also slow you down. That push and pull of optimization and razor thin edges (that makes you mutter obscenities when you miss a resource by 1) really makes this an interesting game. Don't play it with overly AP prone people as it will drag on forever. However, with the right group it is a really great experience that just fits so well thematically and mechanistically.

An interesting mash-up of resource gathering worker placement and deck-building mechanics (by way of Concordia), set in the context of an unstable racing game. Except that it's harder to keep your resources than to gather them, and your workers come and go as they please. It's certainly different, but I'm not sure if that earns it a spot in the collection.

RATING: 8
Race game which cleverly combines worker placement and deck building. Players compete against each other to be the first to reach the Pacific Ocean following the route taken by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. This is achieved by travelling along rivers and through mountains using modes of transport such as canoes and horses purchase from local Native Americans. Workers are placed to acquire resources and characters can also be obtained to bring more powerful actions. The key to the game is to carefully balance the right number of resources and knowing when to move along the route. Too many unused resources slows the player down or can result in them going backwards. The winner is the first to complete the journey. 'L&C' combines two well worn mechanisms very well and is cleverly designed. It requires a serious amount of though at times to figure out the optimum time to attempt to move along the route and provides quite a unique gaming experience. There's nothing else like this out there at the moment.

RATING: 7.5
Sound Euro. Has a number of different resources which can be traded up for actions, actions being more efficient resource changing, more resource gathering (characters), more resource storage (boats) and most important, more efficient travelling (canoes, characters). Usually has more than one method of establishing this, leaving you with a diverse set of options to tackle the problems at hand. Main problem of course getting ahead as it is a race game, but there is a game mechanic forcing you to empty your hand and resources (as much as possible) by the end of your turn or you will be penalized.

The diverse set of characters appearing in every game makes that this game has very high replayability and the racing aspect, the fact that resource gathering directly keys in to what opponents are doing and the ever present scarity of devoted action spaces makes this a more interactive euro as normal, even though there is no direct trading or spatial effect (akin to Terra Mystica) involved. Good thing as well is that there is more theme as usual in a Euro - the mechanics and theme match well and don't feel tacked on.

If you like Euro's, a bit of interaction and don't want to spend a lot of euro's on getting/trying them all, this is a very accessible, surprisingly deep and highly replayable game that will keep you involved for a long time. Recommended!

Man, has this game gotten some buzz and attention. Naturally I had to try it!
This game combines Stone Age style worker placement with deck building and a race element. All things I enjoy. And it's put together quite nicely, with some nice twists. There's enough meaningful choices to make. It's a fun game. I enjoyed playing it. Until the second half. Once everyone got his deck up and running in such a way that he was satisfied with it, the game became very repetitive. We just had to keep going through the motions until someone crossed the end point of the river. Maybe it had to do with group think, but I don't think so. At a certain point, it doesn't become beneficial to get too many new cards. Especially since the cards are one big mixed deck in stead of stacked decks that gradually give better cards at higher costs. That would keep the game interesting longer I think.
It's a fine game, but I don't think - judging from this first game - that this is a great game.
One more thing: please stop printing your games in China. I know the components in this game are decent (by Chinese norms) but I was put off by it. Especially the flimsy cards.

Really enjoyed thoughtful and Tense game, having read the book "Undaunted Courage" by Stephen Ambrose I was worried that the game would be too abstract and the theme and feel of the story would be lost, however, was pleasantly surprised, the game does feel like the journey depicted on the book, sending the scouting party into the unknown, spending time with the natives trading and struggling to glean information about the way ahead. Yes it's an abstract view of this but all the characters are there and with their different abilities they do feel like characters.

If anyone wants to understand what Lewis & Clark were up against check out the paintings of Charles Fritz, he has done 100 paintings following their journey.

Takes the engine building/VP race of most Euro games and cleverly (and surprisingly, seemingly originally) simply converts it into a physical race. The deck building is a nice addition here, whereas usually I dislike it. Perhaps the non-shuffling of your cards, as also seen in Concordia, is the key.

The track can be nicely varied using the terrain tokens provided which allows for repeat play. 

This is a charming little game that should only be played with non-AP players. If you take more than a minute on any single turn, I get to stab you in the eye with a fork.

Update: I can concerns about the longevity of this game, and 4 plays in, I think I've seen everything there is to see and will be moving on. I'll leave my rating as is, but if I end up playing it again in the near future my rating may well take a hit.

Update: After further plays this has become a case of build a lean deck and run it. See if it's more efficient than your opponents. It has become the same (dull) exercise that all other deck builders are. It's a well crafted deck builder, it's just not for me.

Rating down from 7.3 to 5.5.

Deck building in a new way. You don`t get points, you must be first in a race. Not you, your camp. You use cards for the action, but also to mutliple the effect, and for the colour (badge). 

Very interesting think is go back on the river. That determine, that you don`t want to have to many indians or resources. Time pressure is high, you can`t do everythink that you want.

You don`t draw cards. You choose cards.  

Fresh and with nice artwork.

This really is something unique. You have to keep an eye on your neighbours production to possibly increase your own production, then you have the ingenious use of the  cards, which you can use to make an action or strengthen an action from a card just played by putting it "hidden" underneath, further being able to strengthen the action cards with indians,with indians & acard in addition or just with indians combined with a deckbuilding element that really stands out from the crowd of deckbuilders. The usual deckbuilder allows you to more or less mindlessly add cards to your deck and somehow this will transform into your tactical scheme for that particular session. You REALLY do not want to clogg your deck here at all and have to be much more considerate about which card(s) to add to your deck. Of course this also means to give much more thought in regards as to which cards you want to discard. Discarding in "Lewis & Clark" means to trash it. Another key factor is that you decide when to take your cards back on your hand (unless there is no other option) with every card you still have on your hand costing you time. Having too many cards can be hurting you, since it will take long time before you get your options back on the hand plus you're giving your opponents nice production boosters with the cards that are already in the play area and finally a big deck will slow down your expedition. This and actually all the mechanics in this game are so very very clever (which I was definitely not during our first session), I am totally enarmoured with this game and want to play it again. I can't think of a more innovative release from the Essen 2013 crop. 
_______________________________________________________

The second take at this was somewhat disillusioning. It showed that we played the game wrong the first time,but the first time we played the game felt much much smoother even though rules were interpreted faulty.The second time around the game was in parts painfully brainy not to mention that the correct rules were found by coincidence when reading an example of a game situation. Which doesn't speak in favor of the rule books' quality. I still like the game and appreciate that it stands out from the lot of the new releases, but due to the rules and the tedious experience this time I had to adjust my rating: 9->7.5

Really good game. Having boats that will slow you down if they get too full is a really clever way to deal with players who would normally hoard resources. This means that you always have to carefully plan what to do so that you don't have extra resources leftover. There is also a real sense of progression as you gain cards that are more efficient and navigate along the scoring track. 

I've only got a few issues with the game. One is that I don't care for careful planning, as I usually like decisions that are more tactical. One or two mistakes can really set you back and you can usually feel that you're far behind even if you're still close to the other players on the score track.
The other gameplay issue, and this coincides with the first, is that it can be a little too thinky. There are two optional actions to take on a turn and you always have to think about the best order to take them. Also, the cards have multiple uses so you always have to consider which card to use for which purpose. This results in player who are normally not very AP-prone having to take really long turns and the game can drag on.

The last thing is that the production seems fairly cheap, and others on the forums have pointed this out as well. The company even admitted that they intentionally made a lower-quality product in order to cut costs. Now, the game is perfectly playable and there are no major issues, but the game just doesn't feel like most modern board game that we're all used to. The cards are bowed, which is not a huge problem but just annoying, and the board and box feel like they may not hold up as well as other games.

Sold.

8.75 is based on solo play. 
Mechanics work very well, integrates a few different popular game mechanics very fluidly. First two games created a large AP Issue for me, but as I started to get the hang of it, the game became much easier to grasp the mechanics and how timing is crucial.  
One of my top games for 2013... Best of the year? Stay tuned to find out.

Very glad I got to play this game. I really enjoyed the mechanics and being forced to determine *how many* resources I need is a very interesting twist. I want to play again, but not so much that I want to own the game. Too AP prone (even for non AP people).

Beautiful artwork, well-made components, a thoughtful theme, and tight mechanics make this game a winner in my book.  It's fun figuring out cool combos and using your opponents placement to your advantage.  Lots of ways to victory.  The historical aspect shows that this game was a labor of love.  Details about all the people on the cards is contained in the rulebook and makes the game really come alive.

This game struck a very positive chord with me.  It was a refreshing experience, the game play has enough significant difference from the more typical Euros.  I love the fact that you're racing on a track and don't have to do all kinds of VP counting.  The art work is solid, the theme is well implemented.  And the game play is much deeper than it initially seems.  Lot of good stuff here and it's inexpensive.

First Impression:

A unique hybrid of an economical efficiency/racing game.

Lots of choices, lots of strategies and lots of replayability are the mark of a good game. The game features mature deck building (not traditional but still far better than anything I've played, including A Few Acres of Snow) and tough resource management (the only game I've played where more is as bad as less). Tying your economical engine with a race ties the pace of the game to the abilities of its players and transforms the final moments of the game into moments of agony and excitement as opposed to "final round let's count vps". The theme ties very well, creates the feeling of an adventure and the little details all over the game cry out that the game is a labour of love.

Player interaction is way too subtle and though it does make some difference it's much less than I'd like. You can't do much if another player has built a better "engine" than you other than wait to lose. It's also prone to analysis paralysis, depending on how clear a strategy each player has. The theme can leave some players indifferent initially, but it's one of those few games that manage to support the theme, as opposed to be supported by it. The racing part doesn't create agony as there is no push your limits aspect to the game.

The game overall is good, to the point that it makes you wonder why noone thought to tie an econ engine with a race before. I liked it, I'm looking forward to play it more but I didn't love it as the winner is usually obvious from midgame.

I wasn't super excited about this one, but it was actually really fun. At the beginning, it is really difficult to make any forward progress. In fact, most people go backwards before they ever go forwards. This game is very much 2 steps forward, 1 step back. Literally. It has a little deck building with the new characters that join your group, giving you more abilities. I like it.

Lewis & Clark is a race game that is card driven.  It's a resource gathering game where gathering more resources than you can use is punished.  And it's a worker placement game where the number of workers you get is determined by how many workers are on the board.  Workers are in short supply at the beginning of the game. And again, having more workers than you can use is punished.  And worker placement is actually a very minor part of the game, being dwarfed by the card play.  

The card aspect is interesting as cards are both abilities to be used or the strength of the ability.  So neat cards can be used as a really cool ability, or as a lot of power for some other card.  So often you'll get a cool card, but not be able to max it out.  

The race aspect of the game is that you move along the path and "set up camp".  Setting up camp is the only way to get your cards back into hand.  It's also the way that you call your camp token up to where your explorer token is... except if you have too many resources, indians or cards in hand, you get penalized and have to move your explorer backwards before your camp moves.

Making the indian pawns red colored, i.e. redskins, was a really poor design choice.

I really enjoyed this and look forward to trying it again.

This game has a bit too much math for my liking.

Basically, you produce goods and attempt to spend all but three of them (one boat load) every turn.  The movement / race track is static, has no Y-branches or choices to speak of, and could be drawn out as a straight line.  

I will play it a few more times solo, but suspect that it will be far more enjoyable with a total of 3 at the table.

I love how the cards in this game have a dual purpose - either providing you with a unique action (except for the starting cards) or with a means to trigger one of these actions. So each turn there are always a couple of small but meaningful decisions to be made. Combined with the actions on the board, the cards provide you with A LOT of options, making this game less suitable for casual gamers or players who are AP prone. That is the sole reason why I do not need to own this game (it would not come to the table often enough). I am still very much looking forward to my next play of this original and very nice looking breath of fresh air.

I was really impressed by this game. The mechanism of having to play two cards at once, one for the action and one for the multiplier is very clever. The scoring is well disguised as a race track, and the worker placement, Indian collection, and time mechanisms are beautifully integrated. The card mechanism of faux deck-building is one I have never seen before, as you have access to all of your cards, but retrieving them comes at a cost. Very well thought out. I had expected this to be another typical worker placement game with little new to offer, but I was wrong. Probably the most original resource collection and worker placement game I have played.

This is one of my favorite Euro games and one that I'll usually be up for playing.  I like that you must play quite differently depending on your turn order, and you must plan ahead. Never forget that this is a race.  If you just try to hoard tons of resources, you will lose.  You must gain JUST enough that you need.  Any more is a waste of time.

Provisional rating, one incomplete play (at Spiel). Interesting but grindy game of resource conversion and hand management.

Very clever game, wasn't too sure what to expect from the little I'd seen on it.  It's essentially an engine-building racing game with a lot of hand management.

I enjoyed it, but the AP is high with this one.  When you have to plan 5+ moves in advance, it's a bit stressful.  Towards the end of the game no one is talking because everyone is crunching numbers trying to add things up in their head.  I can really only play one game like this in a night.  I don't really enjoy games as much that just come down to numbers.

I'd like to own it though, and I'd be interested to play it again sometime. I could see it being an amazing game for those serious gamers who really love to cook their brain and have zero luck influencing things.

Beautiful artwork. Theme and mechanics are integrated very well. A lot of different characters. Interesting solo rules that also help to explore the game.

A downside is that all players need to be familiar with characters to prevent one of them to run away towards the end of the game. If the leading player has built a great deck it's usually quite hard to stop them from winning and several last turns are just watching them run towards victory.

I only sold the game as no one wanted to play it and I got tired of playing it solo.

I'm terrible at this game.  You could skip several turns, go eat a ham sandwich or something, and you'd still beat me.  But I like it, and it's beautiful.  

Side note: I sure hope the history regarding the characters in the game is accurate, because it's my sole education on the Louisiana purchase and the L&C expedition.  I'm not sure where I was when this was taught in school, but I remember none of it.  Thanks to my time with this game, however, I think I could teach a class on the subject at a junior college somewhere (maybe I'd even grow a beard).

Well designed game, well oiled mechanic with a rich theme and great production. Excellent.

[+] V.Dutrait's art! great mix of mechanics that I really enjoy (multiple card usage, resource management, multiple ways to complete the track), I like the race finality instead of a VP battle, seems well balanced
[-] big box full of air... giant board but the most important part (the river track) is so small and intricate
mostly "multi-player solitaire", ok you benefit from neighbour's colors but there's no way to control your timining; even the rule that lets you skip over an opponent, while breaking the "solitaire" feel, just makes no sense and "breaks" the race aspect in 4-5p games: your often better off waiting for other players to go into mountains so you can just skip over 3-4 spaces at once.
I prefer playing where ther is no skip, everyone has to complete the whole track.

(After 1 5p game) A race game with 2 different terrain types.  Infinite replayability with extra terrain tiles to change up the course.  Also have a huge deck of cards which give you special powers.  Balance your Indians on your cards (come back to you) and those sent to collect things on the main board (don't come back to you).   

If I had the time and energy to invest in all of the cards or really enjoyed the possible combos I could see liking this better.  BUT the numbers on the cards were small and the iconography just seemed a bit off to me.   Might try with 3 if possible.

I had high expectation for this game. I was hoping to play a great and complex racing game, and i got disappointed. This is not a racing game. A racing game need steady progress like flowing water, for immersion feeling, but here the progress is like refill and draining a bucket for few huge step forward.

In essence, this is an engine building game, using cards and worker placement as mechanic, with a twist. The racing aspect itself is simply inherent to the theme. With these in mind, it is actually a well-designed game. High production value as well, with excellent artwork and the box insert are especially great.

Too bad it doesnt really fit to my taste, so this game is leaving my collection.

Good, interesting mix of resource conversion, deck building, worker placement and racing game. A bit fiddly and long (for first-timers) and I am not sure about its staying power, but at least good for a number of plays.

Still good, primarily puzzle-driven, resource conversion/management, racing game. After my one and only previous game I thought I knew what to do to play much better, which turned out to be right resulting in a fairly comfortable win. The game is not "solved" but I am quite sure that there is one correct overall approach. Each game will still be different due to the many different character cards and combinations.

I do like the game; 'Lewis and Clark', about exploring the state of Louisiana after Napoleon sold it to the Americans and these two gents were sent to do the task. Players take the role of individual expeditions seeking to be first to locate their camp past the Pacific coast using the equipment and resources they can muster. Effectively, players trade resources to build canoes and use horses to travel across river and mountain and also to encourage Indian support and trade for additional cards. There are over fifty of these so don't expect to understand the ramifications of all. I think there were a few misinterpretations from the game only having previously being played with two where presumably not all of the cards were deployed. I think there is a flaw in the game, as I understand it from observation, and that is that when there are more than one or more players in the mountain pass, the first player to take all the Indians from the pool, using activation cards to do so, the other players will be severely hampered, Yes, penalties are incurred for unused cards, Indians and unused resources, but when your opponents are not ,moving at all, that's a small price to pay. I would play this game again and again as I like the theme. I do feel one of the cards I had was not  interpreted correctly and I did check the wording after and that did make the game slightly less enjoyable. And yet, like I say, I'd play a nicely themed game again, nonetheless and I suspect that's a good endorsement despite the one minor glitch.

Is Lewis and Clark a soulless cube pusher with little interaction? Yes, so if that's a deal breaker avoid this game. Also, it's probably not worth playing with more than 3 as the downtime would just be too much (the 2 player game is great). Those cautions aside, Lewis and Clark is a wonderful game that combines deck building with race game and throws in some worker placement for good measure. Every game is different as you must base your strategy on the cards that are available for purchase (only a subset of the entire deck is seen in a given game). The fact they provided tokens you can use to alter the geography of the board is a nice touch that should enhance replayability even more. I've already played Lewis and Clark 5+ times, and don't see myself tiring anytime soon.

This is a tough one for me to bash. The cards and components are beautiful, the deck building and tableau building mechanisms are wonderfully executed and even the manual is well done, making a somewhat complex game easy to understand and the flavor text and historical background in the last few pages. I adore it.

But the game itself...Well, it's fun and challenging at first. But after about three games, you start to realize that with only two terrain types, it starts to become more about building a small tight engine than actually exploring any interesting card interactions. Worse, once someone gets an engine put together, they usually run away with the game. There is no way to slow them down, so usually you know who is going to win 2 or 3 turns before it actually happens. That's a real drag and ultimately what made me decide to trade this guy away.

It's a bummer, because it was one of my favorite productions of 2013.

This game has so many good things going for it. I love the production and artwork, the theme is very integral to the gameplay and the mechanics feel very tight.

The little engine you build with your cards can fill punishing and satisfying at the same time. I would always suggest to play this game, it is that much fun.

Beautiful, thematic euro game. Lewis & Clark is all about perfect timing and balanced resource/hand management. The huge variety of cards allows players to pick a slightly different strategy everytime they play. Awesome game.

An OK game, but I'm not sure where the hype is coming from.  Pretty nominal interaction in a sort of puzzly, I need to be really, really efficient way.

Cards seem to get uninteresting pretty quickly.

Really good solo play actually, only problem I have with the game is that once you build an engine you basically just sit with it for the rest of the game and whoever built the best one in the first 3 or 4 turns is going to win

it seemed Mac Gerdts' Concordia all over again:  very slow beginning, then a good game full of interesting decisions. some mechanics really remind me of Concordia while others are really good and original, for instance the shared workers. Some problem with the possible analysis paralysis toward the end of the game but it's a good gaming experience, with a nice rythm in the middle third of the game.

A race to the west coast with some interesting card play, worker placement, and resource conversion. I've only played once and it was solo, but the game doesn't quite capture me yet. It all felt a little too fast and while the cards are pretty, I don't see how it all fits into the theme. While I am rating this game, this is another one where the rating will probably change after a few more plays.

After playing this solo, I have to say that it was enjoyable but AP-inducing. I would definitely play it solo again, but I'm worried that a multiplayer game would drag with everyone considering so many ways to use their resources.

Our rafts are loaded with provisions of wood, pelts and buffalo meat. It is a race for up to five explorers to be the first to reach the Pacific. Interesting hand management decisions to use or sacrifice our retainers or equipment. Love their new system of combining and using the multi-purpose cards. Stunning artwork. Problem with a runaway leader at the mountains where the tendency of the laggards is to mail it in.

Excellent racing game using a quite unique worker placement mechanism.  You can use so many different strategies to reach the same goal, often with very close and unpredictable endings.

All of the mechanics mesh with the historical theme perfectly, and all of the character cards are based on historical people.

Finally, one of the best looking boards I've seen.  Beautiful.

An excellent hybrid of many genres, players much do much with little on each turn. Each round, one must decide which cards to activate and which to turn face-down, as all around the table choose between activating their most powerful cards a limited number of times, or activating their weaker cards many times. The game can slow as players reach the mountains and must reconsider their method of travel, though experienced players will plan for the mountains well before their scout advances that far, ensuring that their path to the Pacific is uninterrupted. Regardless, the decision of when to pare down one's expedition and continue with a skeleton crew is a treat for those who love engine-builders where efficiency is more valuable than sheer power, and can be the deciding factor in close games.

RATING: 6
Racing game with a unique interaction that allows actions to become more powerful based other players using similar actions. The time element forces players to consider exactly what they want to do forces players to play lean, collecting the minimum amount of resources necessary to achieve their actions or else have to move backward along the route.

The action cards a different every game so there are always different action available to advance the expedition, but despite the different actions, players are essentially doing the same thing. Everyone needs the same resources to advance on rivers and the same resources to advance over mountains, and the cards that allow for both advancements are mostly similar.

There is minor player interaction that mostly involves collecting resources or taking additional action points. Although minor, it's enough to matter that you have to consider what your opponents will do and how that will affect your plan in the next several turns.

Biggest downfall is the huge amount of forward planning involved in the game, leading to some intense analysis paralysis. As that plan unfolds, we constantly felt like we made a huge mistake that drastically set us back. In fact, one big mistake can potentially set a player back 4 turns behind everyone else (which happened in our game).

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] J'aime bien la façon d'intégrer un système de gestion de main avec un système de placement d'ouvrier. Le tout s'imbrique parfaitement bien pour créer un jeu ayant caractère historique bien réalisé. J'aimerais bien essayé ce jeu en mode solitaire pour apprécié certaines subtilité qu'il m'est impossible d'apprécié pleinement en jouant en groupe, bien que ce jeu se joue très bien lors d'une partie à 5 joueurs.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] I love the way they put a deck building and a worker placement systems togheter. Everything is assembled very well to create this historical game. I would love to try this game in a solo session to be able to fully appreciate all the little twists of it. This game play very well with a groupe of 5.

A thinky brain-burning euro with some interaction, in which players are racing to reach the ocean first. You can improve your team by building more boats to transport goods or natives, by hiring new teammembers, and by letting other teammembers go. Your scout runs out ahead of you, but everytime you set up camp, he might have to double back if you haven't moved efficiently enough. 
Great art and good thematic integration: this is a great game.

An awesome card drafting mechanic.  I really enjoy the race element.  However, I think this game should adopt the Jambo element that the first player to set up camp doesn't necessarily win...everyone else gets one last turn to see if they can match or beat that position.  Awesome card art and an intense game.

Love the game.  It's up there with Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy, as far as gameplay goes.  You're not going to see a lot of direct conflict but, knowing how to cue off of what your opponents are doing is absolutely KEY to winning.  Of any game I own, this one is probably the most polarizing; people seem to either love it or hate it.

Lovely art and interesting game design. It can be quite unforgiving and it definitely rewards optimal play to the point where if you get behind it can be very difficult to catch up.

This is a very interesting worker placement, and deck building race game. How it utilizes the various mechanisms is very interesting, but I think the game is a bit of a brain burner, with the huge number of options open to you on every turn. It seems to be best at three players, given the game's high amount of down time. My rating may go up if future plays become much faster.

It must be the slowest racing game that I have ever played!

Though the core "hand building" component of L&C is pretty much the same as Concordias the focus here on building combos in your hand is much more interesting... though also much more brain burny.  Balancing how you use your hand against what items and people you end the turn with to keep your camp moving forward just adds to the puzzle and makes this a lot of fun who enjoy planning a few moves ahead, maximizing your moves and occasionally having your plans foiled unintentionally (and sometimes intentionally) by your opponents.  I just love the art and theme but its a bit too much to explain and grok for what I'm going for in most of my collection these days.

Today there suddenly came to opportunity to play Lewis & Clark, a game we noticed just before Spiel 13, and we hoped we would be able to play it in Essen. Unfortunately all the tables were occupied with players all of the time. Today we went to the Belgium version of Spiel 13, called Spel 13. There was one table with Lewis & Clark on it, and as we passed and had a look, we were asked to play the game. We took the offer, and after the game was explained to us, we started playing. In the first couple of rounds, I was disappointed in the game. Mainly because of the way the game was explained to us. The guy who was explaining, did teach us the game good, that is, he told us everything there is to know about this game. The only minor point, is the fact that he gave is the idea, that he had to catch a train in 10 minutes, but that his boss told us, to explain the game to us, before he could leave. But slowly the game-mechanism became clear, and it evolved in a very nice, smooth and almost easy game. Each round, a player can do one action. He has only a choice between two different ones. Play a card or play an Indian. That’s it. When he plays a card, the card has to be activated. This can be done by placing the back of another card besides the card or by placing an Indian (1, 2 or 3) on the card. The back of the card shows 1 to 3 Indians on it. The amount of Indians, are telling you, how many times the card can be activated. And there is exactly where the trick is in this game. A very simple card, can become very power-full this way. But you don’t want it to be too power-full, because it can kick you back on the river, because your boats became too heavy. By placing the back of a card, you’ll ‘loose’ another possible action, so you’ll have to look carefully which back of card you’re playing. Some cards for gathering resources will look at your neighbors cards to determine how many resources you’ll gather. By doing it like this, there becomes interaction into the game. The interaction, is also one of the biggest minor points of this game. Because the action your neighbor took, might influence your move, you want to wait before you start thinking what to do. And as this is a game of calculation and strategy, it slows the game down. Also the hexagon tokens which represent buffalo’s, wood, stone and skins are a bit dull, and tear the theme down. I’ve seen some stickers already that can be placed onto the hexagon tokens, and they improve the game-experience. Besides the two minor drawbacks, this is a game that I could recommend to everyone.

A deck builder of sorts, with some worker placement, but at its heart a pretty straight forward race. Not one to play with those prone to analysis paralysis, but plenty to like about this.

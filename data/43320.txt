RATING: 7.5
This version really does improve Tomb with curses, crypt master cards (so you can play against others when raiding crypts) and crypt lords (to give you a possibly faster ending to the game and a greater challenge). Extra boards, better rules, a tons of new cards makes this expansion a slam dunk for any fan of the original. For me, it now is always part of the standard game - never will play without it again.

I played Tomb first then tracked down a copy... well I decided to go a new version because I thought it would be improved. I fear I was wrong. I liked the art, although AEG has been re-using it a fair amount. I've looked for cleared up rules and card text, but no luck (If anyone actually has a good clean set of rules I'd love to see them). Too confusing, too long, too hitty, and too badly written.

Pretty tough to follow rules. Lots of things you have  do decide / make up as you go. Fun stuff, though, if you're not too competitive or concerned about playing it right. Cool assortment of characters and cards, and it's a blast rolling a handful of twenty-one dice!

So, I LOOVVVEEEE the original Tomb game. It is a chaotic mess of a game that has given me some of my most fun moments ever in gaming. This expansion/stand alone game basically continues that tradition, but not quite up to the same extent as the original. First, I don't enjoy the 2 new card types included, Cryptmaster and Curse cards. The CM cards are just too swingy to really be useful. Also, in a 2 player game (which is the only way I play Tomb) they also lose a lot of their cool factor. The Curse cards are more of a hindrance to slow the game down. If you fail your initial roll to remove the Curse, you have to end your turn. Don't like that. Good things about this set: the Advanced side of the board is by far the coolest board of the 4 available in the game. Lots of mayhem and death going on. The new Prayers and Spells seem to be not only better balanced but also just cooler than the original ones. So yes, this is a keeper. I will probably just end up shuffling all of the cards into the decks from the original game, remove Curses and Cryptmaster cards, get rid of anything that has to do with Mercenary rules (another lame thing in this set) and go from there. I would be so happy if they ever decide to bring this back from the dead with a new box.

I like the dungeon-crawl theme in connection with the mechanic where everyone "designs" the dungeon together.

I got talked into playing Cryptmaster even though I did not like the original Tomb.  I don't know what they "fixed" in this version of Tomb.  The rulebook is still terrible: poorly laid out, incomplete, and has no examples of play.  The game is still ridiculously random.  One item card can double a character's power while another does almost nothing (e.g., heal one wound) yet both cards cost exactly the same to acquire (random draw from the pile).  The huge variability in the strength and utility of the different cards & characters combined with the need for many house rules to cover how different powers interact (because most of the interaction are not explained in the rules) makes for a highly random and tedious game.  No thank you.

[u]March 2010:[/u] Lots of randomness, but lots of fun and goodness too! The game is too long though, I assume it will be shorter once we start knowing the cards as we spent a lot of time reading them but with the sheer amount of stuff in their, my guess is it's going to take more than 2 or 3 plays! Of course the variety is what makes the game shine with 80+ characters with different abilities, 100+ tomb cards, 100+ spells, prayers, items and tactic cards...
I haven't played the original Tomb.

RATING: 1
I really wanted to love this game, because I absolutely love a good dungeon crawl, but the confusing and contradictory rules completely ruin the experience of it. 

Do not play this game with people who always feel the need to argue vehemently over unclear rules, it will completely ruin the game for you. 

This game very nearly destroyed my gaming group because of the frustration it caused. 

The art on the cards remains the sole reason for my rating of 1, otherwise I would rate this game a Zero.

Some board games don't get a lot of playtime because of their length, others you bring out only on special occasions. Tomb is not like that.

Tomb is the only board game I have ever regretted purchasing.

Do not buy Tomb: Cryptmaster.

RATING: 7.5
A solid dungeon crawl from AEG.  Ruleboook leaves a bit to be desired but the sheer amounts of monsters, characters, traps, and treasures ensures this one will stay fresh for awhile.  A worthy game for your collection!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
The rules may not be all too clear, but this is not because of an abundance of them. I think everything can be house-ruled as far as necessary without any real issues.

For solo play, the game tends to pivot on a team being able to take hits for a rogue who gets the composite bow (or even better: having Dorin Windbow in it) and enough skill boosts. In two games I ended up with a rogue who cleared the entire tomb with hardly any chance for any monsters to even react. And since most traps are checked against skill, those were not hard to disarm either. I feel this may be a sign of imbalance, but the game is not advertised as being playable solo in the first place. It is still enjoyable as a solo game, though, and there will be nobody to argue your house rules either.

I cannot stand anymore vague rulebooks and lousy playtested games. The basic ideas and mechanisms are true and tried, but the implementation blows. What a pity, this could have been a stellar competitive dungeon crawler... As is, it is instead a hot mess unless one wants to invest a lot of time and energy filling in the gaps and houseruling.

"No bullshit" dungeon crawler - assemble your team, get in, kick some asses, and try to survive. Oh, and you're also supposed to fail with the latter - it's rather low, dark fantasy setting, so your heroes are not killing machines in fancy armour. Brilliant, down to earth gameplay in this overlooked masterpiece, if you manage to solve terrible rule book with some house rules.

There were a few minor frustrations, but mostly it was straightforward dungeon-crawling entertainment. There seemed to be a narrow sweet spot in which challenges were really interesting; the rest of the time parties weren't buff enough to handle things well, or were insanely overequipped. That narrowness might have been due to us all being first-time players, though it seems like even veterans would only be able to judge very loosely how difficult an encounter would be by the number of cards in the room.

Fixes some rule issues, and adds more to the game play, love it! I do want to say that arguing over the rules can be a game breaker for this game. The game is in essence "broken" with some cards because of a lack of rules and support. If you can get past these issues, and as a group get them resolved quickly, the game is fun.

I was totally mistaken in what this game is about. I thought it was the usual recruit a party and build on that game but no no. Here your characters gets killed left and right by totally unbalanced monsters and card effects. 

Fun?

Sure, if you're in the mood for a take that dice fest and don't mind all the killing. Actually as an experience game where you do't expect to win or even finish it can be an enjoyable ride. Don't get too attached to your characters thought, they won't live long anyway.

The game seems to require several house rules to even work which is a bad sign in my book. I have only tried the "advanced" side and it was very deadly, so perhaps the standard side is better?

The addition of Cryptmaster cards & Bosses, and tightened up wording of the cards is an improvement over the base game.  However, it is still lacking.  Great concept, poor implementation.

Identical game except it adds the hassle of curses and special mean cards for cryptmasters, and has a number of variations for play (overlords, player vs player).  Offers fewer PCs to draw from (and tavern cards) but tends to be much meaner and aggressive play between players.  Again, needs to be played to see which version is better (although I suspect this one is simply because of the cryptmaster deck).

RATING: 7
A fun dungeon crawl... if you can somehow get around the dreadful game manual. I think that creating such a bad booklet should be punishable by law.

Apart from that, there are some nice mechanisms (playing as both the party and the dungeon master and reducing the downtime), which make the game enjoyable. If you can get around the manual, you'll probably enjoy this "take that" dungeon crawl made short.

RATING: 5
The rules are garbage.  The game could have been fun and awesome but the rules are unclear and contradicting. Randomness is not always fun. Some tombs are filled with crappy little monsters and some have the angel of destruction in it and kill your whole party. For the randomness that is involved it is way too long of a game.

A fun competitive dungeon crawl with beautiful artwork, lots of characters, monsters, traps, curses, and treasures, allowing for a lot of replayability.  There is a lot of dice rolling in this game, but there also is a lot of strategy to go along with it especially in regards to how you build your team, and deciding when your party is sufficiently strong enough to take on very powerful monsters.  Oh and while you're doing all that, your opponents will play cards to make monsters stronger, steal your gear, or even kill off that party member most crucial to your success.  This is an incredibly fun game that plays slow the first few times you play it, but moves much faster as everyone gets accustomed to the rules and the skills available to you.

Speaking of, the one real downside to this game is the rulebook is unfortunately vague and simply not up to the quality standards of the rest of the game.  This can lead to numerous debates about what a certain card means or what is allowable, but it can be easily solvable by making house rules.  It certainly does detract from an otherwise excellent game, but if you're willing to be adaptable in that regard you should have a really enjoyable experience.

Final Rating: 7.5/10 (Fun competitive game that loses 1.5pts for the rulebook)

It's a must-have for playing Tomb. It adds so much into the game: better rules (though still have some flaws), more dices now (always not enough), more challenging monsters, more varieties with new cards in spells, prayers, items and tactics (will never play the same game twice!), new inclusion of curse is nice, Cryptmaster card of CM is excellent, Overlord cards are powerful, sometimes it completely changes the game, and that means more surprises which is good and new board map to play with.

Game manual is awful. You'll need to read through the the original Tomb game manual (Available online), and even then, you'll still have to struggle to manage through. After 3 play-throughs, I think I finally got the game and the mechanics down. Past that, it has moments of being a fun, difficult, cutthroat game. However, the game's pacing can really make it lag. When one person is fighting, it can take several minutes (I've seen a turn take up to 10! minutes). I cannot recommend this at all.

The rules are very poorly written and I feel like only half of the rules are there.  We spent more time trying to find rules and debate on cards than actually playing (I still have no idea what to do with the pillage pile once it's made).  The mechanics were mediocre at best.

Really cool dungeon crawler. Very unique in it's execution, but also really messy. 

Takes quite a bit of reading to get the rules nailed down and really enjoy the game. There are so many cards and combinations of abilities that things can be pretty overwhelming and drag the game out a bit. There's a good amount of community work on revising some of the rules to make the game flow better. I myself have house ruled several different things and it's really improved the experience. Overall it can be an amazing game if you have the patience to tweak things to your liking.

This is one of the best 'sleeper' dungeon crawls I have played.  The artwork is fantastic, and hearkens back to Warlord: Saga of the Storm (also by AEG).  Components are well constructed.  The game play is logical and well done, with a good amount of replay-ability.  I wish AEG would re-issue this, and the original Tomb.  They are certainly very well done for a mid-weight dungeon crawl.

Played two games (one three player, one four) that both lasted 3-4 hours.  

Long story short: players build parties to attack crypts, each of which has an unknown array of traps, curses, monsters, and treasures in it.  Players can build up some sweet combos to become powerful, but the crypts can be even more powerful.  We ran into multiple combinations in each game that were essentially "Your party is trashed unless you have one specific power."   This happened to me twice in the first game, and once in the second.  In all three cases, nothing I did could have done would have prevented the damage, and there was no warning that the crypt had those.  Now, this kind of randomness is fine in a short game, but in a three hour game it's just too much.  Takes the wind out of your sails, and makes it impossible to win (especially when things like traps are discarded after they've killed your party, so nobody else has to face them).

Also, some players can get game-breaking combinations that create invulnerable parties.  Two people in one game created this, leading to a score of 96-81-21.  

A fun idea, and I love the theme, but the total-destruction-with-nothing-you-can-do is just too much.  Oh yeah, and then 80-gazillion unique special powers leads to far too much reading of cards and referring to the rules manual during battles to resolve the inevitable "how do these three special powers that all fire simultaneously resolve?" questions.

RATING: 6
The standing joke for this is that all the rules you need to know are on the box cover - "Recruit a party. Kill some monsters. Take the treasure". Right, let's start.

For those of us who play Tomb infrequently, this feels much like the original and all my same comments apply: The game centres around the characters you draft. They'll be strong in one of the 4 things you need to roll for (attacking, skill, magic or healing), quality being a function of what dice you get to roll. Each character also has a bonus power in text which can be important. So draft a party of characters, take some turns collecting bonus/action cards until you feel you're ready, or bored, and then move on out. Your mission is to clear those crypts. Crypts contain trap cards (roll dice to beat), then monster cards (roll dice to beat) then treasure cards (bank 'em). Every card you beat is worth VPs. Most VPs wins once all the crypts are clear. If you die, go back and recruit another party. You'll know some of the cards at some of the crypts from the seeding at gamestart (ie go to where you've placed cards you can beat!!). There's some decision making in getting a good symbiotic party together, and each crypt is a mini-puzzle on how best to fight it in terms of character order and cards to play. But game pace is very uneven. Turns either whizz past fast or are cryptlike slow. Fights can take a while as others just sit and watch - there can be a ton of dice to roll, cards to go through, combat rounds can go back and forth. Not that exciting really. It's just a big dicefest slugfest. And the winner will probably be decided semi-randomly anyway by who finds the best value XP cards to beat. 

This version adds cards that the guy playing the monsters that turn can play to make things harder. The board's a bit easier to get around. I'm sure there's other stuff adding variety for those who care, but for the non-afficionado it all felt exactly the same. In short, too unevenly paced to be lots of fun.

They needed an "editing eye" (to use a Tim Gunn-ism) for this game.  Every little card does not need to be unique to comprise good replayability value.  It seemed like there were no duplicate cards in any of the decks!  It seemed so hard to keep track of all your party's abilities, all their special gear, all their special spells and tactics, and then for goodness sake's the monsters get special abilities, random spells/prayers, and extras too.  And all the special things were so complex!  It wasn't just bonus dice or something easy to remember, every special power seemed to require a paragraph of explanatory text.

Otherwise, I think the general concepts of the game were great.  I like the specialty dice, I like the basic rhythm of recruit, go forth, kill monsters, gather treasure, take casualties, recruit, etc.  I like the way inactive players get to handle the monsters.  But this doesn't seem to scale well to 5, too much downtime.

I'd give it another try with less players, maybe earlier in the day when I'm sharper and can handle all those crazy specialties.  But I don't think this will ever be my favorite way to dungeon crawl.  As much as I love some complex Ameritrash, a little elegance goes a long way without sacrificing too much theme.

Oh, Tomb. There is a good game somewhere in here, I just know it, but I have no idea where. After not touching this one for years I dusted it off, looked up some serviceable solo rules and gave it a whirl. 

Tomb has a dizzying array of different things going on. From the scores of characters to the giant stack of crypt cards, items, spells, prayers, tactics, and cryptmaster cards ("take that" cards for when it's your turn to control the monsters); there is [i]so much stuff[/i] there is actually [i]too much stuff[/i] and everything is big, awkward, and horribly unbalanced. You often find yourself rolling more dice of a color than is available, adding multiple numbers together, trying to remember all your reacts and take [i]all[/i] the different factors into account. Combat feels like more work than it's worth, and in a large game the downtime would make the significant delays in Runebound seem short. Also, you really must use the "optional" crypt drafting mechanic where the players set up the crypts by drafting from a refilling hand of three cards, it isn't really optional in my opinion.

But... [i]so much stuff[/i] it's just... everything has it's own unique piece of art, every item, every treasure, monsters, character, all of it (fans of Thunderstone will see a lot of recycled art from Tomb). It's just such a pleasure to flip through all the stuff, that all does different stuff. The variety is staggering and you get excited about it all until you realize that on the whole, the game doesn't really work. It's so close to being so, so, good I [i]want[/i] it to be what the designer obviously intended it to be, but it's not. I would recommend Tomb to certain people, but people who enjoy tight mechanics, order, and easily understood rules and situations (the RAR are garbage, you NEED the revised rules and FAQ) will absolutely [i]not[/i] like Tomb.

This game needs a remake, AEG, you hear me? Do it. This has the potential to be one of the [i]best[/i] dungeon crawlers in the hobby if it's handled correctly and given some TLC.

A huge improvement over the original. Even better when mixed together. Love to have options in the different Tomb boards and tons of different heroes. I feel like I see something new every time I play. There are still plenty of quirks with the game such as imbalanced combos with heroes and equipment, but I'm usually having too much fun to notice. Also, the Cryptmaster rulebook is a HUGE improvement over the original.

15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Tomb is an interesting game, in which you first players first build a tomb with many small crypts and in turn order fill them with monsters, traps and treasures.

You draft a party, and enter the Tomb, and start opening crypts. If you open a crypt, you try to disarm traps, kill monsters and get the treasure, but likely you will die. The game is HARSH. Especially when you enter a crypt, your opponnent takes control of the crypt and informs you what challenges you have to do in order to defeat the threats in the crypt. Monsters are evil. The first hit a figure (and likely kill it), then your heroes get a chance to damage it. If all heroes have attacked, the monter kills another hero..

I did feel that the game had some interesting ideas.. but was flawed in some ways decreasing my enjoyment of it. I didn't like the tomb-building, felt that random cards would've been better. In addition, I felt that the artwork was a bit drab. It was good, but it doesn't feel spectacular or original. The game is too harsh for me, it's interesting, but soo punishing that it feels like Pain: the boardgame. If you enjoy that, you might enjoy Tomb.

If you have ever spent time playing 8 bit RPG's you will enjoy this game.  It reminds me of playing the original final fantasy on my nintendo.  This game does suffer from some poor rules and a horrible rule book but if you can make it past that the components are high quality and running through a dungeon hunting treasure and killing monsters by rolling buckets of dice, How can you go wrong?

Thoughts after one play.

Far too much going on for a dungeon crawl. The interactions of the cards and characters is mind boggling and not intuitive, even for hardened CCG players.

Lovely production though! Seems like 5 players is too many, might be a lot more fun with three. Set up seems to favour gamers with a good memory.

a game with potential. People gather their parties consisting of different kinds of heroes (over 60 to choose from) and go in a dungeon where the goal is to get the most value in treasures. Other players try to avoid you getting the best treasures and most powerful items.

The already horrendous rules of the original are muddled further with this expansion, and I found the gameplay to be almost destroyed by near constant (and futile) referencing to the rulebook.  Its still fun with the right group if you can manage to get past the rules frustration.

RATING: 6
That rating may climb as I log more plays.  This is one of those games that needs time.  It's a bit long for what it is, but experienced players should be able to get things moving quickly enough to enjoy the game.  If all players are first timers, there's a huge amount of downtime.  I like the mechanics, but it's quite complex.  This is a game that could be good, but not likely on your first play.  The rules could definitely have been better written.  This was nigh unplayable until I downloaded a one-page guide from the BGG boards.  Even then, there were things that we got wrong on the first play.  The art is atmospheric, but a bit on the muddy side.  Text on the characters and cards is definitely on the small side, and the green and blue dice almost look alike in even mildly low light.  This could have been better, though those willing to tackle the learning curve will likely enjoy it.

Dungeon crawling, with lots of randomness, but with an equal quantity of risk management decisions. The rules are not very solid though.

Exploración de mazmorras, con mucho azar, pero con una cantidad igual de control de riesgos. Aunque las reglas no son muy sólidas.

RATING: 3
Worse instruction manual ever.  I read the manual ahead of time and it was already confusing.  It was difficult to understand how to play.  When we played it, we spent half the time trying to really figure out how to play.  For whatever reason, when I need to look up something, it was impossible to find.  I'm one who knows 3E/3.5 D&D and can look up and find a rule amongst dozens of rulebooks and yet, I cannot find anything in the Tomb rulebook that is just over a dozen pages.  There is not a single example of how things are played to see if I actually understand the wording of the rules.

Later, I found an FAQ and realised that we played it wrong in so many ways.  I even tried to find things that the FAQ says in the rulebook and it was extremely difficult.

Cards are just not played the way you expect to play them.  In fact, a lot of the rules just isn't intuitive.  You end up thinking that the rules are a certain way and it ends up being totally different.  There are just so many cards that are not played the way everyone around the table thinks they should be played.  Combat is asymmetrical and different.  The player raiding a tomb chooses who gets attacked whether the monsters or party attacks.  Cryptmaster cards are played differently than other cards and yet they are all in your hand.

The FAQ makes better sense of the rules.  You should not attempt to play this without reading the FAQ on this site first.  It will clarify a lot of confusion and you will not end up wasting half your time trying to figure out how certain parts of the game works.

I like the flavour of it as a dungeon crawl type of game.  Now that I read the FAQ, I have a far greater understanding of how the game should be played.  The next time I played, we knew the rules and it went much better.

The issues I have with this game are many.  The rulebook is the biggest.  Also, the rules for playing cards are unintuitive.  I expect to play cards from my hand except maybe for items, but spells, prayers and tactics are like items where you play from your hand to attach to characters and then play their effects after they are attached.  We all got confused until the FAQ.  Cryptmaster cards are played from your hand.  

The game has all characters as tiles and plenty of stands.  However, the stands are only used for your party tile because that is what you move around the board.  The character tiles are usually just placed in front of you.  They would have been better off just have the characters as cards instead of tiles.

The game tends to get really complex as you have up to 5 characters plus 10 cards.  You can get even more cards as you play.  I found that my friends were getting AP looking at all possible plays.  I personally like controlling a party of 5 with equipment and spells and other cards, but it seems to get overwhelming for my friends.

The setup process seems to be a lot of work for what I feel to be of marginal value.  I understand the purpose of it, but I just don't feel the payoff is worth the extra setup time of everyone filling up the dungeon.  We just did the blind setup as it took less time.

I don't know if this game will hit the table again with my play group.  I've already ordered a replacement game that is of a similar flavour that I think is simpler and faster to play.

I love this game for what it is. If you get really attached to your party of adventurers then this game is not for you, but if you want a more realistic dungeon crawl where the heroes don't always win the battles and "TPK" is on the tip of everyone's tongues, then this game is for you.

RATING: 7
Mixed reactions... I like the original Tomb, and found this to be mostly more of the same. Crypt Master works as a stand alone expansion, so the best bang for the buck may be simply combining it with your main set of Tomb.

There is a bit more screw-your-neighbor, which is good, The Crypt Master cards can make things more challenging for your opponents, and several of the characters have a reflexive attack for when you're running the monsters in a particular encounter.

Not sure if I like the Overlord mechanic...  it seems to end the game too quickly.  I haven't played it enough to say though, and Tomb really is pretty chaotic.  I'm sure milleage will vary from game to game.

Still, I think it was a fun time.  If you like Tomb, this is a welcome addition, if only for the new maps, heroes, items, etc.

Disclaimer: I have not played the original

Before I bought this game I was really intrigued by what I saw, despite what critics said. I have found a lot of its critiques to be true...but somehow I still rather enjoy it.

If I based my rating purely on that enjoyment it would be at least a 7.5...

Anyway, here goes:

The thematic feel of the game is wonderful. I'm certain there are other games that get it right (maybe even do a better job) but I feel like I have a real party entering a tomb and competing with other parties trying to beat me to treasure.

The negatives: Two main negatives, and one smaller inevitable one with a game like this. 1. I have yet to complete a game in under 3 hours (and it can take longer). The game says it should take a lot less time than this. 2. The rules really are terrible. The game tries to do too much and creates too many variants that bog it down. Some of the spells/specials I hardly understand and I am often forced to use house rules in order to enjoy the game and not be lost in trying to figure out how it's supposed to work. The other minor complaint is downtime for games with 6 players. The cryptmaster is an awesome idea and everyone wants to play that role, but some I have played with seemed disengaged while other battles are going on...especially if several happen before they get a turn.

RATING: 5
Many nice ideas but too much packed into what was supposed to be a fast dungeon crawl. Would need some streamlining. Simply takes us forever to play even with only three players mostly due to the vast number of effects to be considered within each raid (characters abilities, attached cards effects, hand cards effects, cryptmaster cards effects, tombs effects - all once for the raider and once for the cryptmaster). Considering crypt master has already the revised ruleset it leaves too much in the open and has no examples of play either. Some rules are not given in detail and the cards wording leaves room for interpretation too often. My gaming group will never allow it to hit the table again.

Once again, it is time to assemble a party and delve into the dangers of the Tomb! Tomb: Cryptmaster is a stand-alone expansion to the 2008 game Tomb, a dungeon adventure game in which each player recruits a unique party and races to clear more of the dungeon than any other player. Tomb: Cryptmaster introduces two new boards, 80 new characters, 400 new cards, more spells, items, prayers, and tactics, and a new deck: the Cryptmaster deck, which contains cards you can use to terrorize your opponents when they foolishly enter a crypt with surprises you have prepared.

The game is playable on its own, or it can be used in conjunction with the original Tomb game. Featuring a revised and expanded rulebook, players may try new variations such as Overlords and Player vs. Player action. Other new features include Henchmen you can hire out to other parties for a share of their loot and hideous Curses you can use to torment other parties foolish enough to get in your way. As with the original game, Tomb: Cryptmaster includes a basic board, this one specially designed for normal or player vs. player action, and an advanced board designed to test the hardiest adventurer!

While I don't enjoy Tomb as much as Runebound or Arkham Horror, I have found the game to have its own unique charm and entertainment value.  For one thing it has soooo many heroes and monsters and treasures that each game is very different which makes it very replayable.  Plus, if you add in the original Tomb, the combination is simply great fun.

Got to play this and liked it a lot in an Ameritrashy sort of way. It's begging for variants and house-rules ihmo, but lots of fun with the right crowd. Would happily play again if anyone suggested it. I like the idea that everyone gets to be both GMs and PCs. Very random but it's the fluff and imagination which make it fun rather than slick and efficient game mechanics. If that's not for you then this game may not be either

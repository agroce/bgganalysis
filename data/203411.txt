This is the game Concept wanted to be.  The only issue is having to constantly look through the cards if you're the clue giver.

Very fun, deeply satisfying when you and your partner achieve a mind meld. The competition and the chance to capitalize on hearing the opponents' guesses raises this above Concept, which is a much more thinky game.

"a perfect mixture of Codenames and Concept"

NO! NO! FINALLY!!!

RATING: 6
"Concept done quickly with cards" is how it was explained to me and that seems to be a fairly accurate description. While I thought I'd hate this game with a passion, it ends up being fairly fun when you're with the right group of people. Makes a good convention game but I can't see playing it in any other setting.

RATING: 6
Decent party game, but I find that it is difficult unless you have a very large table to spread out all of the words.  Concept lets you do it with a single board and using pieces to connect and Imagine lets you do it with a very limited number of translucent pieces.

I'd probably still pick either of those two over word slam.

A really good clue-giving word game, where teams race to discover the hidden word for the round, with one clue giver for each team providing their team clues in the form of a deck of word cards to choose from. That deck of word cards is the only way a clue-giver is allowed to communicate with his team.

So, for example, the secret word might be "rice", and a clue giver could put out clues like small, eat, and white. Or, in one entertaining example, the word was Eminem, and the clues fast and singer were given, along with name, yellow, green, blue, brown, and red.

The tricky part is that each team is trying to discover the secret word simultaneously. While you can't see the other teams clues, you can hear all the guesses they're making, which can be a clue in itself!

Overall, similar to the game, Concept, but I think I enjoyed this more due to the frantic nature of trying to beat the other team to the word.

Excellent party game that feels like a meld of Word Blur and Concept.  Clue givers sift through cards to describe the target word for their team - meanwhile the other team does the same.  Players can listen to the direction the other team is taking, but can't see their clues.

Imagine the Olde Tyme Game called Password. But you can’t say anything, you have to flip through a stack of preprogrammed word cards. 

Someone printed that as a game.

A party game that boils down to how fast you can find relevant words on a table full of word cards.   If that sounds fun to you, then you will probably enjoy this.  It's the kind of party game that I only need to play a couple of times and I'm good.

The talents of the in-form Inka & Markus Brand seemingly no know limits.  With [thing=203411][/thing] they have devised a wonderful party game.  Whilst [thing=178900][/thing] is undeniably brilliant, it suffers from two problems: there can be much downtime from players thinking too hard to find connections, and also it can make some people feel uncomfortable when they can’t think of any clues, some can feel dumb and embarrassed.  [thing=203411][/thing] eliminates all those issues and makes a great interactive team race game from a simple word-based clue mechanic. 

Two teams compete to guess the secret word that only one player from each team knows.  They are the clue-givers.  Simultaneously each clue-giver goes through their identical stack of around 60 word-clue cards and, without speaking or doing any actions, gives clues by showing their respective team relevant single-word clue cards.  Each team is shouting out ideas based on their clues, and by doing so are also giving clues to the opposing team.  It works fantastically.  It is fast, furious and hugely entertaining. 

If you like Codenames and want to set a word-based game in the context of a fast game such as say [thing=1353][/thing], then definitely look at [thing=203411][/thing].  It has become my family’s new fave party game and has replaced Codenames as our goto social game.

I favour some of the heavier Brand designs (though I do like word games) but got roped into this one since we were playing through the SDJ nominees.  We played with 8.  The guesses can kind of ping pong and escalate between teams once you start hearing the other team's guesses. Surprisingly fun!!
After awhile we stopped tracking points and just played.

RATING: 8
Great!  Fast, easy to teach, works with a range of player counts.  More active and with far less down-time than Codenames (this is all-play).

It feels like the harder challenges have been carefully chosen with consideration for which words are in the deck (and which words are NOT).

For me, the main con was the dexterity requirement to quickly search/fumble through the largest of the card decks.  This can lead to serious team imbalance before wits are considered.  Tip: suggest your clue-giver split that noun deck into two piles.

It's a shame about the unnecessarily big box, as this game would otherwise have been  portable.

Opinion is after one play session, so I don't know, for example, how it feels when you really know the small decks inside out.

A bit weird to get into as you have to search 4 different stacks of cards to find fitting descriptions. Comes a bit down to speed of draw for balanced teams. Having written this, the game did grow on us and we had fun - more so if longer chains of cards were needed to explain the hidden word. Will not turn this one down if asked to play, though I prefer games like Concept or Krazy Wordz in this category.

I like Word Blur, so I was eager to try this. After playing it, I'd say I like Word Blur better. The word selection for each player leaves something to be desired, although I kind of like that each person has their own set of (identical) words instead of picking from a common pool.

Je ein Spieler aus jedem Team erhält einen Begriff (je den selben) und müssen diesen mit Karten erklären. Auf den Karten sind verschiedene Begriffe, bzw. Eigenschaften (hoch, laut, gelb, etc.) abgedruckt. Das Team, das den Begriff zuerst errät, erhält die Karte und damit 1 Punkt.

RATING: 5
A game where you have a complex concept and have to select cards from different decks to get someone to come up with the concept.  You are sorting through the deck as quickly as you can.  I found sifting through the deck a little clunky.  I suppose over time you would start to memorize the decks and it would be easier.  

Although sort of run, that sorting mechanic is tiresome.  I would play the game but would not want to own it.

Reminds me quite a bit of Concept.  Concept will be better for "visual" gamers while Word Slam will likely be better for "verbal" gamers.  Word Slam feels like more of a game than Concept does since you have two teams competing to guess the word first.  I love that you can play off of the other team's guesses.  I've noticed some people seem to struggle with the "sub concepts" in Concept. They will likely be a better clue giver in Word Slam since differentiating the clues isn't quite as important as it would be in Concept.  

Most people won't need to own both games so I'd say Word Slam has the slight edge for me.  It feels more competitive and will likely be easier for all types of people to play.

To be fair I played with like 30 people and didn't get a great feeling for the game with so many eyes and ears. It was a ball though we all loved it! The pressure is on when it is your turn to describe the word. It is so complicated and amazingly fun to puzzle it all out. I can't wait to play again.

RATING: 7
This is Concept with words and teams which works well. It is lighthearted and easy for people to join and leave which puts it in that rare category of a game night opener. Searching through the decks can be a randomising element as the 'right' cards might be at the bottom. Giving the players the heads-up when it's a 'pop culture' clue is wise. The interaction between the teams is fun, though and, whereas in Codenames if you know the opponents' answer you'd better keep quiet, in this their clues/guesses are as valuable as yours for getting the right answer.

-zwei Teams spielen gegeneinander (ab 4 Personen zu empfehlen)
-ein "Begrifferklärspiel" wie Tabu oder Concept
-Schwierigkeit kann angepasst werden
-kurzweilig, keine Downtime (da Teams gleichzeitig raten).

Das Spiel hat uns bisher immer sehr viel Spaß gemacht.
Von jedem Team muss ein Spieler mit Hilfe von Karten für sein(e) Mitspieler Begriffe erklären.
Beide Teams raten gleichzeitig, die gelegten Karten sind dabei für das andere Team nicht einsehbar, allerdings hört man auch die Rateversuche des anderen Teams, die einen zusätzlich zum richtigen Begriff führen können.
Es gibt vier verschiedene Kartenstapel:
Substantive,Verben, Adjektive u. Sonstige 
Die Begriffe mit der eingeschränkten Wortwahl zu erklären ist besonders im schwierigsten Level sehr fordernd.

This game is in the tradition of Taboo, and similar games, but it does it smarter and better.  It comes across feeling like Concept with words.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
Word Slam is pretty much a reverse version of Taboo since each team has an identical deck of cards and only the words on those cards can be used to describe the target word or phrase. However, flipping through 105 cards in an attempt to see what's allowed and find right the words to use is really annoying. In addition, the other team is doing the same thing and picking out many, if not all, of the same word cards, so what's the point? Our play group really found this game to be tedious and not fun. I really like word games, but Word Slam just wasn't for me. I'd rather play Taboo since it has good tension and is actually fun to play.

Cute team game where you're describing a word to your partner using piles of cards (nouns, verbs, adjectives, ___). You race to find appropriate words in the piles of cards, putting them up on a card rack. You can move cards around, but you cannot point or make any sounds -- it's all in the words/phrasing you choose. The game feels a bit like Concept, except that this is actually a game and actually fun!

Really liking this so far for six or more players.

I will say that there are four levels of difficulty, and after just looking at some of the most difficult cards I don't see how some of the words would be possible to guess. Equilibrium, nightmare, Capitol Building, Hocus Pocus. And the only clues you can give are using the 105 words which tend to be really basic and general. For comparison, the more standard difficulty levels include words like fork, box, cola. This shouldn't be an issue, though, because there are dozens of cards for the easier difficulty levels, and each card has six different words on it.

Also the game would go a little long with the rules as written. Like a lot of party games, we just play a few rounds or until one team gets really far ahead.

For now this will be a keeper. It's good for a group of six or more who have already played Codenames to death.

RATING: 8
This is a fun party team game.  It isn't Codenames, but quite frankly no party game is.  I'm not sure the legs on this, but the first couple of games were raucous laughter and fun.  It is far tougher not to gesture while giving clues in this game compared to other games requiring a poker face.  I don't think I'd ever play with fewer than 6.

Codenames has set the bar pretty high for word party games, this one rewards the team who can most quickly sort through and retrieve the desired clue word(s).

Very fun game! It's great to have a few games like this in your collection that are really enjoyable but don't take up your whole night. I played the prototype game with my wife and some friends, and we got very competitive and had a great time. The cards are of good quality, and the artwork is really cool! Overall, a great game!

I didn't want to stop playing this game. I played it with 3 players and could have played it all night. From simplicity, strategic complexity springs. It's an easy to learn, quick to play, bidding game, with lots of interactions, things you should try to remember, and "should I go for it?" decision making. Ideally, you want to keep winning bids, but only just barely, without over bidding and wasting your best cards. You need to keep track of your opponent's behavior to try and guess how they will bid. A thing of beauty. The biology theme is a bonus too, but science-love is not a requirement for the game play.

I had the chance to play a "almost final" version of Virus: an infectious card game .... 
If you are looking for a easy learning and fast playing bling bidding and set collection game thats the game you should aim for ....

Fun filler game in the vein of Sushi Go; quick to both learn and play!  Unlike many of Genius Games' other titles, you don't need to have a great deal of background in science to appreciate it, as well, and the sort of combat aspect adds a fun twist, as well.

[100] Fine for quick filler, though my first game of this went longer than I wanted to be playing, and the early-game dice-rolling (before anyone gets modifier cards) is more gratuitously random than I prefer my games. I do like that the bid mix includes engine-building components (as well as the flat/set-collection point sources), and that some rounds are just palpably better/worse than others due to vaccines.

2nd the theme was Cool I quite like it.
3rd Play through is simple and easy to teach.
4th Myself and everyone I had a chance to play with enjoyed this game. I played this Multiple times over 2 days with a bunch of different players. Ages Varied also.
Not one person I played with had a negative thing to say about this game.

A simpler, quicker 7 wonders feel.
Good for all levels of gamers being easy to teach and learn.
As with most bidding games, more players the better. If you have 2 players you may as well play something designed for it, the excitement just isnt there in this. 
But otherwise a solid game.

Wonderful, wonderful little blind bidding set collection game.  I was pulled into a quick game at Gen Con 2017 and I scooped the game right up.  I'm finding I really enjoy blind bidding as a mechanic.

A light card game that plays fast with just the right amount of decision making and strategy. Thematically the virus theme is not as integral and therefore falls more into the 'pasted on' spectrum. (Kickstarter Edition)

RATING: 9
Virus is a well thought out game with a fusion of set collecting and bidding.  Its light, easy to learn, fast to teach and almost instantly replayable.  The setup is simple and well explained. The cards are attractive but not distracting.  The card stock is above average.  The mechanic begins to flow almost immediatly.  The rulebook even in beta was easy to read, well designed, illustrated for too much detail and small enough to pass to kids and not get the "i have to read all this?"  I appreciate the theme.  It has a place at all tables including the classroom.

Theme is fresh. Blind bidding / trick-taking style mechanics combined with set collecting and very light engine (almost deck-) building. Its a decent game, but I felt the mutated viruses were too strong. First player getting one could rather easily make sure he got the rest too. In two-player game the bidding lost most of its purpose when one player hoarded all the mutated cards.  Game was still pretty even  but I feel I did not have enough interesting choices to keep me entertained for consecutive plays.  Works better with 3-5 players.

Not as heavy as some of the other Genius series, which makes it a fun addition to the series, but its weakness is the bidding system. You blind bid for advantages. Biologically, this is solid. But you roll dice to resolve the bid, which... isn't inaccurate but is not as accurate as bidding, since biology (the actual life of life) is a game of resource management and gambles on adaptations. I think the solution here could easily be stolen from Killer Bunnies: two cards down. The top one is your bid for the round at hand, you turn the second if there's a tie, but otherwise you slide the second up to the top and place another bid card second in your row. Not only does this eliminate the gamer's perception of weirdness of having both numeric card values and dice, I submit that it more accurately represents the risks and rewards of adaptation. @ me your thoughts!

Hand management/hidden auction game with a mechanic of dice rolling to resolve ties.

Dice rolls are mitigated by the collection of "power" cards that add to your roll.

Set collection is simple following the Sushi Go formula. 

Good little filler

I got the opportunity to play this game with the developers. The gameplay is very solid. The rules are simple enough for casual players to understand, but there are enough paths to victory that it's enjoyable even for experienced gamers. I like how there's no definite strategy that will win every time, and also how there's just enough random chance to make each game a unique experience. A fantastic quick game with little setup a lot of replay value. My only complaint is that the theme doesn't seem to be very attached to the mechanics, although the art looks cool.

I wouldn't recommend as a 2 player game.  I don't think the 2 player variant is broken or anything; it's just MUCH better at 4-5 players.  The bidding is far more interesting with a higher player count.

If you enjoy set collection and blind bidding, you'll enjoy this game.  I would recommend if you are looking for light weight card game - one you could play with your family/parents/etc.

I was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game was.  The bidding is interesting because there is a mix of point cards, set collection cards, and better bid cards -- but what cards have been played recently or collected previously inform your priorities.  It is fast, offers choices, and still produces dramatic twists when players second guess each other incorrectly.

Die rolling for tie break is stupidly random early in the game, but fine once players start to earn bonus cards to boost their rolls.

as is:  6/10
with minor house rule for tie breaks:  7/10

Easy to learn, quick to play, and no downtime.  Plenty of decisions to keep it interesting and suspenseful, but also a good gateway for non-gamers.  The virus theme is great, and the art is perfect for that subject.

The first game was interesting and new!  I'm holding back on rating until I get a few more games under my belt.

Update:  Three games in so far.  I'm enjoying this, in spite of my usual failure with abstract strategy.  It is fun to balance between identifying more of your pieces and leveraging the ones you have pegged already.

Update:  This makes a good lunch game, since it can be played in 40 minutes or so.  I still enjoy it every time it comes out.

RATING: 4
An interesting twist on Stratego with players being able to see their opponents pieces, making the deduction element a little harder than it's inspiration.

I'm not a big fan of deduction games as they seem like work to me so my rating is strictly by the BGG scale.

+ Excellent components; Very tense gameplay in which you feel like you are in a very real struggle against your opponent.
- Plays very much as an abstract, so if theme is a primary motivator for gaming (as it is for me and most of my friends), you're going to get burned out on this pretty fast.


Why it's previously-owned:
When I could sit down and play a lengthy and brain-burning game with a friend or with my wife, there were just always better choices that were higher up our priority list.
I ended up trading this for Caylus (equally brain-burning, but with a bit more engagement).  We don't really have a deduction-style game at the moment, but the whole GIPF series has taken the role of the abstract game in our collection.

RATING: 7
Another amazing piece of work from Stronghold.
A bit tight fit on some of the pieces and the paintwork is slightly shoddy, but I was blown away by the enormous player booklets and general quality is excellent.

The game itself is a mixture of blind Shogi and an american football "touchdown" drive.

Frustrating, head scratching and absolutely brilliant. Recommended.

RATING: 7
Two aspects: deduction and movement. In limited play, it feels like once you/opponent define movement for one or two pieces the game goes quickly. Doesn't appear it is worth spending time figuring out what all your pieces do.

RATING: 7.5
Confusion could have been one of my favourite abstract games, if it didn't receive the lack of the right amount of vision during the development process.

Play with variant 1-no double-spy, 2-narrow board and 3-one full turn on last row for the best abstract game experience.

Confusion is like football, where you only are able to score if you have the ball. And it is a very difficult game for the defender, since the spy with the suitcase always can see the spot where he is safe or can bluff his way out, especially when he is highly mobile.

It still is a brilliant game, but it fails somewhere. Especially when you play is chesswise like me.

RATING: 7
The components in this game are very solid and very well done.  There are some minor print quality issues in the plastic pieces.  These are noticeable, but not significant.  Game play is also well represented.  The game plays surprisingly quick and is quite fluid.  It may be tempting to suspect that Analysis Paralysis would run high, but it doesn't.  Quite the opposite - the game continues to move along very well.  It is this odd behavior that actual is the game's only detraction.  It's possible (and entirely likely) that one player will only need 2 or 3 pieces to be learned in order to maneuver for a win.  That is, a player will likely not learn all of his pieces (and shouldn't try to).  This is counter-intuitive, but is a key to playing well.  Overall, this is a good game and its good that it got an updated printing.  If you are a fan of deductive games and looking for a quick play, this one is worth checking out.

RATING: 6
An unconventional abstract game.  It's a bit like reverse stratego.  You own a variety of pieces which all move differently, but their identities are only known to your players.  part of the game is deducing how your pieces actually move, the other is a more classic "chess-like" game of capturing and maneuver.

So far my games have ended rather quickly and felt underwhelming but there's enough potential here to warrant further plays.

Edit:  A unique idea that doesn't appear to live up to it's potential.  Maybe I'm just not clicking with it.

Liked this better than I expected after the game was introduced to me.  A Stratego-like game of deduction where you can see how your opponent moves, but not how your pieces move.  You attempt to move a piece and your opponent lets you know if it is a legal move or not.  Definitely feels like the random setup can impact the result.

Played this a second time and liked it as much as the first.  It's a pretty decent 2 player game.

Played 3 games against a hardcore gamer. He goes to conventions and with his wife own lots of games.
He won the first two mostly by focusing on one piece. But the third game I wound him down by taking out his pieces one by one. I could have won at one point. We were playing with alternate rule of requiring your winning piece be in the last row for at least one turn. There were 3 possible pieces there within striking distance of my advancement to the end row, but only one for sure could have taken me out. I chose to extend the game a little and see if I couldn't get some other pieces over there to take some of his other nearby pieces out. Needless to say, I lost my piece with the brief case. And that is how the game went on to pegging off his spies one by one.

This paragraph prob belongs else where, but might still be useful. It is here, for now.

RATING: 5
I struggle to rate this - as I can see it is a good game for the right type of person, but that isn't me.

Which is a bit odd, as I expect to like it. I quite like Stratego, but this left me cold.

Possibly the learning curve is so steep you need to play quite a bit for the game to shine - but there's no chance that will happen for me, you'd have to drag me kicking a screaming to play it again, I found it an unpleasant mix of thinking, double bluff, guesswork and frustration. I'm supposed to spend my time playing games having fun, this wasn't :(

So all in all - I can see why people rave about it - I didn't like it at all, so really should rate it a 2 or 3 (by the geek scale) but that seems so unfair as I'm clearly not the target gamer, so I'll give it a 5.

Good bits in this abstract made into a spy adventure. Clever mechanic where there is open information on your opponents pieces, but he has to deduce information on his own pieces by attempting movement options. The double agent adds a nice thematic element as well as providing a strategic option for bluffing. Fun game that will play in under one hour.

I guess this is as difficult as the two players would like to make it: they can either find out a lot about a few pieces which will then determine the outcome together with some luck at defending the last few steps; or find out enough information about many pieces to turn it into something akin to chess. As an avid chess player I like the latter take better. :)

Oh, I don't know.  I tend not to like 2 player games in general, and this doesn't help the cause.   While it's got a clever mechanic in trying to guess pieces, it still doesn't feel like anything new.  Maybe after being spoiled by some great games I'm becoming  real new game snob.... but this gets a rating of 6.

I went into a demo of this intrigued, and ended up enjoying it much more than I expected too. I think the reason I'm drawn to it is that it's a simple system with a lot of depth that asks the players to use a lot of skills: the game has interesting tactical elements in addition to bluffing, deduction, and risk management. The risk management and bluffing are actually more important, I think, than the deduction. And the new Stronghold version is very nicely produced and the Cold War theming works rather well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This 2 player game sounded awesome as it’s a little like stratego/chess with some deduction element thrown in. The game is probably best in the beginning as there is a lot of deduction going on (although to be fair you aren’t deducing as much as simply excluding options). Near the end of the game it becomes too chess-like when you know how your units move and such. Then it really felt like chess as certain pieces could only be moved in certain directions. This is a little sad.

The double agent, and the tree extra chits that you can play once during the game, are some pretty good ideas as they make the game much more interesting. You never know for sure which piece is which, and the special bonus chits enable you to make some sneaky moves!

I’ve played it three times, and one of my plays ended after just 10 minutes, another one dragged on and became a lot of back-and-forth and almost too chess-like, and my last play was definitely the coolest as both of us played very well and used those bonus chits and eliminated a lot of each other’s pieces. So the game can definitely play out in different ways. In order for me to like the game even more, there should be much more deduction going on and less chess-related gameplay.

Fun, and this is from an abstract-hater.  Can't go higher because of two problems: (1) the deduction element is really an elimination exercise; and (2) luck can play a heavy role.  For instance, I just had a game where I had a piece I learned about that could go two diagonally, and, as luck would have it, was able to charge through enemy lines because my opponent's pieces were arrayed in a way to allow it, from the way they were set up at the start.

Some deduction and chess-like piece movements/capturing. Objective is to obtain the centerpiece (a briefcase in this thematic interpretation) and return it to the opponent's side of the board. The trick is players don't know what movement capabilities each of their pieces has. That happens over time from using deduction by the opponent answering. 
"This piece will try to move laterally two spaces to here. Can it do that?" 
"Yeah, it can."
"Cool. So, I know it's not this, this and this then."

Interesting game, but the theme is pretty nonexistent and irrelevant.

A strategic two-player abstract with a heavy deduction element. At the start of the game, neither player knows how their own pieces move. Via performing attempted moves, each player tries to deduce the movement of their own pieces. As you determine how to move your pieces, your goal is to capture the neutral piece, initially located in the center of the board, and deliver it to your opponent's side of the board.

RATING: 6
Players play either the Soviet Union or the USA during the Cold War, trying to secure a briefcase of documents.  Simple abstract game, where players take turns moving one of their pieces on a gridded game board.  The catch is the player can only see one side of their piece, denoted by a letter, while their opponent can see the other side of the piece which shows the legal moves that piece can make.  Once a piece is moved, the opponent declares whether the move was legal, or illegal (the move is cancelled).  Then there is the delicious double agent, who the opponent can simply lie about, either allowign or disallowing moves as they see fit.  Slowly, through deduction and elimination, a picture begins to form of what pieces are what.  As pieces jockey around the board, captures occur, and the briefcase is seized from the centre of the board.  The object of the game is to seize the briefcase and run it to the opponents board edge.  Mechanically simple, but tactically rich game where you have to walk a tightrope of offence, defence, and rapid deduction as you get to know your pieces.  I never played the original, but the Stronghold edition is large, heavy and very lavish.  I'm not sure if any rules have changed (such as the unfortunate changes to Code 777), but it seemed very solid to me, and a lot of fun.  Very good.

The deduction element is very well done but a surprisingly small part of the game - in a few plays I've generally only known the identities 3 or 4 pieces by game end. Which means the luck of initial setup can play a big role in determining the outcome.

I've never tried playing with the secret agents and I'm convinced they'd make the game worse.

A chess-like game with a twist: you don't know how any of your pieces move. Each piece has an interchangeable tile which indicates its movement, but these tiles face your opponent. Every time you move a piece, your opponent will tell you whether the move was legal or not, and if it was not, you must move the piece back.  You can keep track of your deductions on a dry-erase board, but one of your pieces is actually a double agent, and your opponent can freely allow or disallow any of its moves.  Figure out how to best use your pieces, get the briefcase, and get it to the other side of the board before your opponent does.

really solid hidden information / chess hybrid.

Finally played this after having it on my shelf for years!  It's a lot of fun, if somewhat a little poorly-aged.

Admittedly, I bought this game because of the neat little pieces it comes with (hollowed-out plastic mahjong tiles) and the deduction aspect turned out to be quite fun.  We gave it a few goes and my one piece single-handedly ran to the other side and scored the touchdown before anyone else could intercept him.

This is where age comes into play, I think - if you're lucky enough to discover the identity of an incredibly mobile spy in the early turns, you can run the football before your opponent has any idea of who or what could possibly stop him, which is what happened to us.  A more modern design probably wouldn't allow that, imo.  I think the game lends itself to better play if both players have had a good chance of discovering who their spies are in an equal capacity.

That being said, if you don't take this game too seriously, it's pretty cool.

And why "football"?  Because thematically the goal of the game makes no sense; you need to pick up the briefcase and deliver it to the other side.  It would seem more reasonable that the goal should be to pick it up and bring it back home, so we twisted our heads around what this might mean.  My only guess is that the case is actually a bomb and you're trying to sneak it into the heart of your enemy.... or it's a football.

Play enhanced by the Stronghold quality.  Partly similar to the deduction required in games like Plunder;  a logic puzzle.

RATING: 6
[2 plays]  Unique and interesting game.  A bit like chess in that you have pieces that can move in different ways.  A bit like Stratego in that the identity of the pieces is hidden--but like Stratego in reverse, because it's not hidden from your opponent, it's hidden from you!  I can't think of another game where you don't know the capacities of your own pieces, but the play could be Battleship-like in that you try something and your opponent tells you how it turned out.  You have to deduce which of your pieces are which by process of elimination and by trying different moves with them.  This is complicated by the fact that some may be captured before you ever know who they are, and also complicated by the fact that there's a treachery element.  One of your pieces is a double agent.  This piece reminds me a bit of the Director character in Whosit, inasmuch as you may often want to mimic some real piece with them.  I lost both games to the double agent, so if it's too easy, watch out!  I'm glad I tried this game, and I'd play it again, but I'm not on fire for it.  Ultimately I think the gameplay was just not fun enough to me to be worth the amount of effort I felt like it would take to develop any skill at this.  But if you're interested in a 2-player abstract/deduction game, it's definitely worth a try.

RATING: 5
Only one play so far. I won in five moves. Not fun. Must try some more to get a better sense of it.

*Update: After two plays this game seems too easy. Just go for the throat with one of your pieces and there's nothing your opponent can do to stop you. More about lucky piece placement than deduction or strategy. Ugh, but I still feel like I have to try it again to be sure.

Fun game, not as thinky as I thought it might be. A good mix of deduction, strategy, and luck. Some care must be taken in playing the double agent well. In my 3 games it was surmised fairly quickly who the double agents were. Looking forward to more plays of this. And it comes with variants!

Nice components and a decent game here however after several moves and failed moves one player got into a position where he could not be stopped. This was a very unlikely occurrence (due to random placement of pieces) however it really soured that game play for both of us and so Confusion is likely to sit on the shelf for a while.

An interesting variation of the Stratego mechanic, flipped on its head! (Or at least, flipped around.) My couple of games were spent figuring out a few pieces only and then each player scrambling for the other side. I was surprised how in both games very few pieces were used. I'm guessing there is more development when players are familiar with competent blocking and passing tactics. It's a real neat idea for a game but one that was lacking deep consideration after it was all done. A little more novel than I was especting actually.

Confusion: Espionage and Deception in the Cold War er et spil fra 1992 af Robert Abbott, der er blevet genoptrykt i 2011. Heldigvis! Sjældent har man set et tema, der så tydeligt er klistret på. Men det betyder ingenting! Et ualmindeligt og ualmindelig interessant deduktionsspil med et element af bluf. Man kæmper om kontrol over en kuffert, der skal bringes til modspillerens baglinje. Der er blot det lille twist, at man ikke ved hvordan ens egne brikker må rykke. Ved at forsøge sig frem og ved at kombinere de informationer man har med den viden man har om de øvrige brikker, afdækker man langsomt ens egne brikkers muligheder for at bevæge sig. Det lyder måske ikke af noget særligt, men det er et klogt lille deduktionsspil, der er meget fængende og yderst originalt.

A neat sort of hybrid between Checkers, Stratego, and a little bit of Chess.

Players command opposing pieces on a board with goal to capture a briefcase in the middle and bring it all the way to the opponent's side. The trick is that each piece has specific movement rules that are unknown to the player. So on a turn, you attempt to move a piece and your opponent tells you whether you were successful or not.

The game has a very nice production including large and helpful piece tracking boards to help you narrow down the identity of your pieces. This one definitely needs a few more plays.

Confusion uses a simplified Stratego style of play that is driven by an approachable deduction game. The deduction here is figuring out how your pieces move. It is quick and fun. A worthwhile game with quality components that is rewarding and fast enough to warrant multiple plays in one session.

The possibility of screwing up your game because of poor note taking is real. But that hasn't happened in any of the games I've played (yet). 

The more I play it, the more depth I see in it. And it plays quickly enough that you can have a rematch in the advent of a bubble victory.

RATING: 7
Stronghold edition components are excellent. The mix of mechanics is unique (to me), the early game is a little formulaic, but once a few pieces start moving about every turn is a tough choice. You have the normal tactical movement abstract choices (sacrifice a piece for later advantage etc etc) and the decision on which piece it is most important to learn more about. The rulebook is not very good, but the rules are simple enough that it didn't slow us down too much.

I think this game really rewards a little luck and some gutsy play.  It is really hard to counter-attack someone with the briefcase making a run for it. Your opponent can check for a weak spot in your line and attack in exactly the right way to make counter-attack highly improbable at best.

I now have a terrific reprint of a classic game with some rather nice components to use. Quite happy to have such a thing.

Wow, what a great game. When I heard about it, I originally thought it was a great game to add to my collection; it is unique, fast to play, and very easy to learn. After getting it, I was impressed by how involved I am while playing. There is a lot of options and strategies to play, and games don't feel repetitive. The game is very high quality and looks great. I use a pen and paper (downloaded a tracking sheet from BBG) to track the pieces, instead of the boards it comes with. The boards the game comes with are super cool, only I play with small kids and dry erase markers can be messing. A highly recommended game.

This is, in my opinion, one of the best two player deduction games out there. My wife loves sluth and clue but you can't play those games with two. So she was very happy to find this gem. The quality of the game is second to none.
The only complaint I read about this game is if an outside pice can move diagonally two towards the briefcase one the fort move it can be a very quick game. So when that happened to me I decided to figure out my other pices instead of killing the game so early. I mentioned this to my wife and the next game we placed each others pieces instead of the random set up and it played even better. This games plays less than an hour and the time just Flys it's so much fun.

Old school fun with this one. Stratego with an added layer of deduction. It is a bit tricky as communicating a small piece of information incorrectly can really throw things for a loop. While figuring out how your pieces move and then how you can use them effectively is fun, you must play very carefully as well. What makes this game different is that you know exactly what your opponent is capable of but not what you are capable of. An excellent twist on basic Stratego idea.

Confusion was on my wishlist for a loooong time until I finally saw it on discount (as an import game it still was not cheap but a little less expensive). But boy, am I glad that I bought it. It's an amazing combination of a chess-style abstract and a deduction game. First half of the game is trying to find out how your pieces can move, the second half is using those pieces to achieve your goal.

RATING: 3
Reverse Stratego meets Blood Bowl. Except your pieces are all snoozing treemen who won't move half of the time. Most of my short games had my opponent grabbing the ball with an identified piece and blitzing through one of my flanks while I largely failed to move even one piece in the vicinity, let alone in a useful manner. From this I concluded that you should focus on identifying key pieces instead of trying one or a few moves with many, but I read in a review that the learning experience goes in the opposite direction. Hmm.

Chess Style. This game is unusual in that you have no idea which of your pieces are which when you begin the game. Each player has 12 pieces with different movement abilities (though each player has the same 12 pieces his opponent has). But startup is random, and only your opponent knows which of your pieces is which. You learn during the game by trying to move pieces and your opponent letting you know if the move is legal - process of elimination, you figure it out. In the meantime, he/she may be carrying the puck to victory!

Not big on the more abstract games but there are always exceptions to the rule and this is one of them. It has an extremely light espionage them of get to the center and grab the top secret macguffin to take back home. The fact that only your opponent knows for sure at the start of the game how your pieces move is a lot of fun. You have to move pieces around a bit first to get a feel for how they can move, then you can start formulating your strategy on how to accomplish your goal. Don't waste too much time trying to determine the identity of every piece though. Pick a few key pieces and work with them. The double agent is a magnificent twist.

Man this is a good game. I love Stronghold's reprint series; the components are just a pleasure to interact with.

It takes a little mental adjustment to grok the relative movement and the difference between how that looks on the pieces and in the dossiers, but after that it's smooth sailing. And quick: One piece you know about in the right spot can win very quickly if your opponent knows less about what's in the way.

The mechanics are brilliant, the pieces are brilliant, the dossiers are brilliant -- there's a lot of brilliance here.

It's a game I should like.  Abstracts are my favorite.  I love bluffing.  Cold war espionage is one of my favorite themes.

and yet... playing this game is a miserable experience.  The first 10 minutes consists of trying to move and then nothing happens.  Each time I've tried to play, someone makes a mistake with the information and it's just a muddled mess.

The game system is fine but not very fun.

I did not immediately grasp the big-picture strategy of this. In the two games we played, both players just figured out what a couple of pieces did, then made strong, aggressive, winning moves with one or two of those pieces.

It's one of those clever ideas that just isn't much fun in practice. Perhaps deeper strategies evolve as you play it more--using more than one or two pieces--but I'm not interested enough to find out.

Didn't enjoy my first game as much as I expected to.  It seems that finding two good pieces and making a run for the opponent's goal is a viable strategy, denying the opponent a chance to get up a reasonable defence.

Second game was much more about deduction than a quick dash for the finish, and therefore more satisfying.  Looks like the playing experience is inherently erratic.

Finally got this to the table and loved it.  I threw away all my early advantage because I wasn't focussing on my opponent's possible moves.

He effectively won despite not finishing (he had to get the last bus home).

I would play this again and again as I realise now the double agent isn't that complicated after all and the rules are straightforward.

I think my gf would love this and naturally thrash the pants off me (as it were)....  :D

RATING: 10
Smashing blend of deduction and strategy where players have to bring a puck in the middle of the board to the opponent's first line without knowing at the start which of his own pieces are which (the opponent arranges them, ha ha). Since it would take a good few dozen turns to know your pieces and by that time the opponent might have already got the puck and decimated your forces, each turn demands a compromise between the "positional value" of the move and the amount of information gained with it. Thus, both the planning and the bookkeeping must be done with extreme care to avoid redundancies and a pace too slow to win.

Although some pieces have a very long reach (the 3 moving forward diagonally can pretty much destroy the enemy if used properly), expert players can always place them in the background so that they can have some time to mount a defense (more or less accurately). Anyway, if a player loses the puck with one of those strong pieces past the half of the board, they'll very possibly break into a cold sweat...

(Note: this review was written before the 2010 reissue of the game, where a minor modification was introduced)

A surprisingly very quick game to learn and play. The board is setup in a somewhat chess like configuration. But you will be completely unable to see what your own pieces are. This is due to the amazing components of this game. The resin block playing pieces have removable centers that are inserted by your opponent at the start of the game. You also have a huge portfolio that you keep notes on with a dry erase marker. This is for marking what you learn about your playing pieces during the game. 

There is a lot of luck to this game. If you discover one of your pieces early enough, and it's one that has easy movement capabilities...the game could be over in less than 5 minutes. Perhaps this is the fault of the game and as a result some games finish so abruptly that it leaves you feeling unsatisfied that you had a fair shot. But you could just start a new game and try again because it is that quick to play.

I really really liked this one. Imagine 12 pieces each deployed on an 11x11 grid. The pieces each move differently - one like a king, one 4 spaces forward only, one up to 2 spaces orthogonally, etc. You can see your opponent’s pieces, but not your own. So you try to move a piece. If you can’t move it, you’ve learnt that it can’t be about half the possible candidates. If you can move it, you’ve also ruled out all the possible pieces that couldn’t move to that space. You gradually learn more and more about your pieces, and as you develop your knowledge, you start to focus on grabbing the puck that starts in the middle of the board and moving it the opposite end of the grid for the win. Your opponent’s moves also tell you about your pieces - there’s Chess like capture, so presumably he’s moved somewhere I can’t land ... or was he bluffing. There’s a Checkers like crowning rule as well. 

And just as cool now I've had a chance to try the reprint. It's less confrontational than the usual 1v1 abstract genre because there's so much luck when you're trying to figure out what your pieces can and can't do. If you get lucky with your initial pieces, you can get an early jump and make it a quick game - which probably happens more often than you'd like. It's one of those games where you wish it could go longer so you can get more into the deduction and bluffing elements it promises.

The tactical possibilities unfold only once you played this game for the first time. Suddenly you realise how important everything is and how you can put to good use the initial set-up. The game is great fun and the fabulous game components make this a lush peace of the collection. Great deduction game coupled with tough tactics! Loved the game and hope it keeps up in the long run (which seems to be the case)

- Easy rules, easy to explain and fun to watch the newcomer revealing a smile once he/she realises how ingenious this game truly is.

Boy, Stronghold really knows how to make a nice looking game. This is essentially reverse Stratego.... instead of capturing a flag, you're capturing a briefcase but only your opponent knows how your pieces move.

Even though I do not own this game, I have been antagonizing my father into getting this game, with me loving the idea behind the game. It is basically playing mind games on your opponent, with him not knowing his pieces as he tries to slowly reveal what they are. The symbols on the pieces allow a novice to understand what the piece represents and has a booklet to determine which piece is what, while trying to trick your opponent into thinking that he has a different piece than what is actually one the board. I also love the double agent, with that being able to become a game-changer in those few moments. Just can't wait for it.

Very well produced and gorgeous Stratego clone with a big chunk of deduction thrown it. Might not appeal to lighter games because it is a bit of a brain burner despite its very simple rules but then again it feels like and old/classic game, so friends of Stratego or Chess might like it. The theme is okay, but the production value makes up for it. Great idea to make the assignment of movement capabilities with the pieces random !

Stratego-like semi-abstract where each player must deduce the movement capabilities of each of his pawns via trial and error (along with his opponent's clarifications). A double-agent, whose movement capabilities could be changed each turn by your opponent, adds some complexity. The goal is to pick up a dossier and carry it to the other end of the board, movement is basic with some promotion capabilities. The theme is the US vs. the USSR during the cold war. Great components.

Hard to categorize combination of abstract strategy game, bluffing game, deduction game...

It's essentially a chess-like game where you don't know what your pieces can do, so you ask your opponent if your proposed move is legal, and you take notes using a well-designed dry marker board. Figuring out what your pieces can do is interesting. It makes it take longer to play than a similar more conventional open information game would take, but it's still playable in under an hour.

The chunky pieces are very nice to handle.

I wish they had kept this new version abstract (as it originally was) instead of tacking on the "cold war" theme with flashy "spy" graphics and giving it a "big box" treatment, but it's still a nifty game!

One of the few abstracts that really captures my interest. It's somewhat high-luck compared to others in the genre, but that does make it interesting. Unfortunately, I always get the feeling that the game is really smaller than the large board, pieces, and set-up indicate. I can't help but feel that if it lasted twice as long, or took up half the space, it'd be a better game.

Also, the fact that the pieces are so damn hard to assemble-disassemble is just poor.

RATING: 7
Stronghold Games have done an admirable job reprinting this with very nice plastic pieces and artwork. I'm impressed.

For all the theme it's an abstract in the same vein as Stratego, but with major differences. Here you can only see how your opponent's pieces move, but not how your own move. You have to grab the suitcase in the middle and take it through your opponent's pieces to their row of back squares. On the way you have to learn how your pieces move and deduce how some of them may move based upon which area of the board your opponent is trying to avoid. Throw into the mix that one of you pieces is a traitorous dog and you've got a nifty little game. Now, I'm not really a fan of deduction games, however this one is nifty enough for me to not only want to play but also own. It's easy to learn, teach and fun to play. Good stuff.

First heard about it on FAT.  Good thing because the title is dumb.

Great little Stratego/Chess/blind variant.  Nice pieces and bits/board.  Learns quick and can play very very quick -- sometimes too quick.  But sometimes it punches way above its weight category becoming a tight little strategy game that almost fits its theme.  Good set of variants to extend replay.  We prefer the Safe Extraction (?) variant.

Absolutely gorgeous and thoughtfully made components sucked me in for a try, though I'm not a big fan of deduction (elimination) games usually (especially since I'm bad at them). Game fell a little flat, very possibly because nearly the entire game is spent trying to make a move and your opponent saying "hell no". But really like the effort put into the theme and the components.

[i]Super Cool Game, Possibly Held Back by Weak Design[/i]

Classy game. The components are really great and fun to use other than the plastic pieces sometimes getting stuck pretty badly inside their shells.

My rating may change based on balance. Seems sort of random so far and like offense is much much easier and safer than defense which is not good in a game like this. One of my games I just discovered an awesome piece early and since you can see your opponent's defensive weaknesses (randomly determined) from the initial setup, seems like a good piece holding the briefcase can cross much faster than your opponent can manage to set up a defense. (they have to discover their pieces AND set them up). If the strategy develops healthily rating will go up, but as of now it seems like a crapshoot -- depending on the initial random setup, the games will either be horrible, just OK, or awesome. 

To reach full potential ideally the game should go on for like 30+ minutes, with most of your army fully developed. This just doesn't seem like a realistic expectation for the majority of games though, and unless I'm wrong then that's a hole in the design since that seems to be the way it "wants" you to play.

A unique combination of an abstract chess-like strategy game and a deduction game, with very nice bits! For fans of abstract strategy games and deduction games, this is probably a must-have! As for me ... I enjoy deduction games, and that part of the game is pretty straightforward. Actually, perhaps a bit too straightforward for my tastes: there are only 14? different possibilities for each piece, and often many possibilities can be eliminated at once. However, I am not a big fan of abstract games. I enjoy some of them well enough, but wouldn't generally seek them out. Here, as you deduce what each of your pieces can do, you have to make those chess-like plans in your head about how to protect your pieces, move them across the board, etc ... I'm just not so good (or interested) in those types of games!

The good ... and the bad (or, at least, areas for improvement):
- great bakelite pieces, nice and chunky and pretty easy to handle
... hard to see pieces directly behind others, so often have to pick them up or move stuff around before you can tell your opponent if his move is legal
... probably cost-prohibitive, but it would be nice to have each piece be double-tall, with slots for the movement bits on both the bottom half facing the opponent (the current setup) and the top half (imagine copying the bottom piece and gluing the copy on top of the original, but facing the opposite direction). You'd then need to have an extra set of movement tokens -- as you figure out what your pieces can do, you'd place the appropriate movement piece into the slot visible to you. Without this type of piece (as in the shipped game), you're constantly looking back and forth between the board and your deduction sheet in order to figure out what piece can move in which direction.

- nice dry-erase deduction sheets to keep track of both what you know about your pieces, and what the opponent knows about theirs
... big, fat markers (bingo-style?) would be better than the little fine-point ones included in the game; easier to X out possibilities

- the move/capture part of the game is actually pretty straightforward 
- the chessiness adds a lot of tension to the game; you can't just sit back and deduce what everything is, because that gives your opponent too much time to move the briefcase forward (if they're willing to work with limited knowledge)!
- there's also bluffing: since the opponent may not know what their piece does, you may be able to safely move your piece into a controlled square (i.e., one that the opponent could reach) -- do they potentially waste a turn trying to take the piece, assuming you're bluffing, or do they just let you be, assuming that their piece can't get to you (and possibly using that to help deduce which piece that is)?
... if you're into that type of thing, anyway!

--- Summary ---
Each player sets up the opponent's side of the board, placing pieces with randomly assigned types of movement in predetermined positions. The movement types for each piece are only visible to the piece's opponent. Place the Top Secret Briefcase in the center of the 11x11 board. Random player begins.

On your turn, attempt to move a piece; opponent tells you whether it's legal or not.
- May not jump over pieces. If move onto opponent piece, remove it from game (unseen).
- May not move into space with your own piece.
- If on space with briefcase, may instead move briefcase using that piece's movement style.
- For the double agent (marked with a '?'), you may allow or disallow any movement on any turn. 
- 4 pieces, marked with crown icon, automatically promote (to move 2 in any direction) if they reach the opponent's home row
In addition, may eliminate one of your own pieces (suspected double-agent) -- remove from the game unseen.

The first player to take the briefcase to the opponent's home row wins immediately!

RATING: 7
This is a very cleverly designed game of deduction and chess-like combat.  In this game each player can see their opponents pieces and their move patterns but none of their own.  Each turn a player attempts to move a piece and their opponent tells them whether or not that is a legal move.  Through this trial-and-error process players will be able to narrow down the legal movement options for their pieces and attempt to, capture-the-flag style, grab a briefcase of Cold War secret documents that starts in the center of the play area and run it to the back line of the opponents side of the board.

I like the deduction puzzle element, it feels similar to Code 777 but along with the puzzle there's more game here.  You use this information to essentially play chess (or maybe Stratego is a better analogy) with your opponent.

The game does suffer from a bit of luck of the draw.  A bad starting set up or bad guessing can leave you stranded while your opponent makes headway and those games can get frustrating as you end up fighting a probably-already-lost uphill battle.  But the design and clever mechanic keeps it both entertaining and interesting to me.

From the box and overly long name, you'd think it was a heavily themed war/conflict game like Twilight Struggle. Surprise! It is an abstract strategy that adds deduction of the "Mastermind" variety to the checker/chess paradigm. Might be compared to Stratego but in this, the piece movement is hidden from the piece owner. It has good components and the variable set up conditions mean that each game is different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Remarkably thematic for an abstract, Confusion perfectly captures the paranoid bluff/double bluff/oh God triple bluff?/kill me now! atmosphere of counterintelligence -- my favourite part is the agonizing problem of whether to make a tactically good move, for example moving from a threatened space to a safe one, because it might reveal to the enemy how her pieces move. Or it might not: is that piece safe, or do I just [i]want[/i] her to think that?

Some of the problems I have with the game are [thread=669218]described by Kevin Nesbitt[/thread] as common to many new players: i.e., that everyone starts off playing too aggressively because it's the easiest way to come to grips with the hidden movement. I hope that's the case, because in my games so far, aggressive play has been rewarded and defensive play has not. 

Initial impressions are that luck can be a vexing influence: board setup is (necessarily) random, but piece position has an impact. A bigger problem is that a successful guess is just [i]better[/i] than an unsuccessful one. That's true in a minor way at all times, but it's critical when you're playing bluff/double-bluff games where pieces are moved within range of an opponent. A typical example is a space that could, in theory, be attacked by three unknown pieces. If only one of the three is actually capable of the attack, a correct guess (33% chance) results in a significantly better outcome. And this outcome is essentially random.

(Thematically this is certainly appropriate, but I don't know that I've ever watched "The Man With One Red Shoe" or "Get Smart" and wanted to be the spymaster whose every plan is ruined by a lucky man persistently bumbling out of trouble.)

I suppose "random" isn't the right word. It's just the same kind of hidden information as "fog of war" games like the Columbia block wargames, which necessitates uninformed choices. As they say of poker, the truth is in the sample size: a poor player can win one hand but a good player will win a lot more over the long term. It's about deduction, yes, but I have a feeling that someone who has to confirm every piece's movement 100% isn't going to win against someone who's willing to make plans based on incomplete knowledge.

And this brings us full circle to aggressive play. The game seems biased towards it because you can always tell if the space you're moving into is safe (or bluff as though it is) -- but the defender doesn't have a clue. Kevin insists that a fast rush won't work against an experienced player, but I think I'll need a hundred more plays to decide for sure one way or another.

That's probably sign enough it's worth the money.

Played this at Dice Tower Con 2012 and really liked it.  Luck factors in some, but that is mitigated if you play best of 3 or something like that.  A fun, yet not very complex, deduction and light strategy game.

Good first impression.  I enjoyed the combination of abstract and deduction.  I'd gladly play more.  The double agent is the killer mechanic here.

RATING: 5
Some theme.  Easy to learn and play.  Play is OK.  If your opponent figures out how a piece moves early in the game, then he can clean out many of your pieces before you have a chance.  Components are fair - mounted board, durable record keeping 'book', and plastic playing pieces.  However, the inner piece can get stuck in the playing piece at times and the stenciling for the playing pieces comes off easily.  Game length is under an hour.

The components -- the board and the bits -- are all jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Even the box is moody and brilliant. This is how you make and market a two-player abstract. Well done, Stronghold.

Initial rating of 8 and very strong potential to move higher. It's easy to get excited about the deduction possibilities and forget about the "chess" game underneath. Because of *my* forgetfulness in this area I don't feel like I've played a proper game of Confusion yet. Once I'm down with the concept in its entirety I imagine there will be some epic possibilities in store. Wish I could play online somewhere!

[one play] I enjoyed trying to figure out what my pieces were, but found the actual gameplay with the pieces a bit dull. Beyond not knowing your own pieces, it's mostly a Stratego variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is so simple it's amazing.  Take on part deduction (similar to Guess Who?) and one part Stratego, mix them up with a dash of screwage (Double Agent!) and you get Confusion, a superb game for 2 players.

The rules are incredibly easy to grasp.  The game itself, is quite another.  There's games within the game and that makes this one really unique.

The components = pure awesome.

Stronghold is firmly establishing itself as a big-time player in the boardgame market.

My wife would rate this a 10 for sure.

Two-player chess inspired game with a tenuous Cold War theme. Each playing piece has a unique movement whether it be forwards in a straight line only, forwards diagonally only, forwards diagonally and sideways etc. At the start of the game you don't know what these moves are though as your pieces face your opponent and you have to gradually deduce which piece is which by asking your opponent if it can move in a certain way. The aim is to transport a briefcase from the centre of the board to your opponent's side by moving your pieces in their allotted ways whilst attempting to avoid being 'captured' by their pieces. The best aspect of 'Confusion' is that there is a double-agent piece which your opponent can deceive you into believing moves a certain way and this can really scupper your plans if you cannot determine which piece it is. There's probably less strategy involved with this game than you would initially expect but there are quite a few original aspects that make it a worthwhile experience to play.

A great strategic game, that plays really quickly once both players know what they are doing, so works well as a starter, filler and end of evening game. 

The production quality on the stronghold games version is stunning and only goes to enhance the immersion factor in their production of it (in essence the game is abstract at its core).

RATING: 6.8
I can't decide if I really like this or if it's almost broken.

It does seem a lot as though you benefit from using just a few pieces and hoping that they allow you to do what you want.

On our first play, we also made a mistake and so I ended up eliminating a piece, thinking it was the spy. In fact, we'd gone wrong somewhere and of course, being a hidden information game, there's no going back.

It is unbelievably pretty though!

Over time, I've grown less enamored by this game.  I thought it was excellent at first.  But I feel like in the end, it because a same old same old type abstract.  Those can be fun, but they have a certain audience, and can be quite polarizing at times.

So long as I don't get to frustrated with my husband's AP, this is great! Would like to try it sometime though, with someone who doesn't feel the need to spend 5 minutes after every turn going through their notes and making sure that everything is ticked off just right, who doesn't have a special symbology of their 4 confidence levels of 'crossed-off-ness' for each piece...just to see what a quicker, more relaxed game would be like :)

Haven't figured out if this game is broken or not yet.  It seems like optimal play is to grab 1 piece and just try to rush it over with the brief case.  If you fail, they rush back.  Both players are just trying to get lucky that they other player fails to stop them.

This is a great alternative to other hidden-piece, abstract games (i.e. Stratego). It's smarter than Stratego because it flips your thinking on its head. Players don't see their own pieces on the board, instead, they see the pieces of their opponents. So by moving a piece and having your opponent tell you if you can or can't do that certain movement, it brings a heavy dose of deduction into play. 

Games are tense, and players who play a lot will definitely learn new tricks to more efficiently deduce what pieces lay where on their side, and then to use them right to complete the objective for the win. 

Highly recommended for people who enjoy games like [b]Stratego[/b] or [b]Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation[/b].

RATING: 8.5
What a fun way to play chess! The opening is a bit slow as one figures out what they've got and I have some concern that there might be a best, most efficient, script for the opening, but even if the first 10 minutes are procedural it will likely not effect my enjoyment.

Sits at an 8.5 after 6 plays.  It will probably settle into a solid 8 with more plays, but I can also imagine a 10 if I can find someone who enjoys it as much as I do.  I have tried this with 3 different people and have not yet found someone who is as crazy about it as I am.  In fact, I would be calling this a 9.5 if I had better success getting others to play and if the game did not require dry-erase markers to play. (I always end up hating those things).




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Definitely intriguing.  I don't think this needed the (rather silly) attempt at theme as it is perfectly fine as a pure abstract.  But the compenents of the Stronghold version are absolutely top notch.  A clever design that was well implemented.

I'm certainly enjoying my first forays into the game.  I've stuck to the original rules (no double agent) for now in games against my daughter and there is definitely enough there to chew on for a while.

Very impressed with this one so far! Great 2-player psychology and deduction - it's What's My Word meets Stratego, somehow! In the first play, I got Kayleigh down to just one piece... who managed to win the game! Why only a 7? Because far too often the game can disappoint, even with the survival variant. There are a decent number of setups that, by luck or skill, can end up unexciting and one-sided. It seems that perhaps more variants are necessary for a really great game?

Brilliant concept and wonderful production value, but I'm still unsure of whether an uninteresting blitz strategy can be countered consistently enough for the game to be worth playing. Need more plays with experienced opponents to assess this issue, but for now skeptical. Rating is bound to either rise or fall depending on how this issue pans out. As is, I think the game is improved (less chance the blitz is effective) with the following official variants: (a) the two dark columns on the sides aren't in play, and (b) to win, you must survive on the opposite end with the briefcase for a whole turn.

I liked this one, but it was a bit frustrating to know so little about your pieces and to not be able to move many of them because of movement restrictions.  I did tend to focus on using pieces in isolation, though, and think I may need to look at using them more in combinations.

Chess variant wrapped in an espionage theme to carry the secret papers from the center of the board to the opponent's side. The meat of the game is not knowing how your own pieces move and using trial and error feedback and deduction. The signature element is the deduction books used by players to track possible movement options.  Nice twist from the double agent adding false information. Clever design to randomly assign movement shells to pieces without revealing to the players.

Stratego + Chess = Confusion.  Love this game!  Deduction games are among my favorite and this is the best deduction game I've ever played.  Every turn is tense.  You are desperate to puzzle out the movement of your own pieces, and once you do, are desperate to coordinate them into picking up the briefcase and delivering it to the enemy country.

Good sweat-equity in this game.  :)

Stronghold Games hits another one out of the park!

Awesome 2-player deduction game with some of the finest components you'll find anywhere.

It plays almost like a cross between Chess and backwards Stratego.  You have to figure out exactly what you're dealing with in each piece, but once you know many of the strategic situations you see in Chess start to appear (chains of pieces protecting each other).  

It is very much an abstract game, but the spy theme does play into it a bit with the double agents. They add just enough uncertainty to make this a pure strategy game (and that's a good thing).

Although it has the usual deduction game problem that misinformation can wreck the game for you, the answers are graphically depicted, so it shouldn't happen as often.  In short, this game is very nice.  You can easily see the relatively clear paths through your opponent's ranks; if only you knew how your own agents move!  The Stronghold edition is very nicely made, maximizing the replay value with high-quality, fully incognito pieces, and five variants in the rulebook.  If you like abstract strategy games and deduction games, this should be a slam dunk for you.

This game is one part chess, one part Stratego, and one part checkers. Basically, if you turn all your Stratego pieces around so your opponent can see them, then give them all unique movement patterns, you've got Confusion. I enjoyed the mechanic, but the game didn't blow me away in execution. It's one of those games that I would play if someone wanted to, but I don't think I'll ever seek it out.

A solid 2 player game that mixes elements of Stratego, chess, draughts (checkers) and deduction to make a really interesting, sub 30 minute game. Awesome components round the package off. A recommendation from me.

Pro's:

1) Excellent art and aesthetics, and perhaps one of the most bizarre themes you can find in board gaming.
2) Iconography as well as game design is excellent. The game does a great job in signalling various tactical archetypes you can select based on the card combinations. IE, it is fairly obvious what the gruffs are meant to do based on the kind of cards available for them as well as their base stats.
3) Deals with mana screw and mana flood within the realm of the game mechanics. Furthermore, resolving the attacking at the beginning of the turn allows and encourages some really interesting interplay.
4) Variety in terms of shepherds, gruffs and playstyles.

Con's:

1) Rulebook could use some more cleaning up and clarifications for some of more random card interactions.
2) Moving the little markers is fiddly, also for people that do not sleave the cards, it can potentially cause damage if you are not careful with them.
3) This game sits in the middle ground of light battle card game and full blown CCG. Which, subsequently is an odd place to be, as it is too complex for casuals but not deep enough to be a replacement for magic the gathering and other CCG's or LCG's. This coupled with the need to be familiar with those games in the first place means it is only suitable to a certain audience that is either jumping ship away from Magic et al or happen to be attracted to the theme because this is a fairly crowded genre already.

I like the idea of the customisable deck, I love the artwork - although I was a bit disappointed that all the action cards just featured the image of the goat they belong to -, but I didn't manage to experience a single satisfying match out of this game. The game would always end up in all players (usually 2, once 3) holding back and “leveling up”, no one hardly ever able to seriously damage the other player(s). Maybe it would have changed once I got more into it, but then I just don't have the time to play a game 10 times before it starts getting fun. It's a shame, it seemed so promising …

Kickstarted.

Update: Fun game, but a not quite the "brawling" experience I was hoping for. The head-to-head battle mechanic is solid and the mutation/upgrading of the goats is enjoyable, but the pace of play is a bit on the slow side, especially if players have AP. It's, by no means, a bad game. Far from it. But with a larger footprint than, say, Star Realms and a little more effort to get synergy going, it falls into the category of "games we sometimes play" rather than "games we must play".  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent game where you can make and resolve plans, unlike the chaotic nature of other card battle games. Lots of faction combos available between all of the decks I imagine. Great art and theme stuff. Similar-ish to Blood Bowl Team Manager.

Could see digging this more in the future.

Oozing with flavor (and other unmentionable substances), Gruff is an exciting head-to-head game with unique mechanics and rewarding gameplay. It's an excellent, largely intuitive game for fans of card games like Magic and L5R. The deckbuilding portion takes time but becomes much easier after a few plays. The different mixtures of goats and shepherds lead to a broad spectrum of games and some crazy board states. Gruff rewards you for finding sneaky interactions between unrelated characters and outwitting your opponent through movement and delayed attacks.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Learning curve and set-up prevent simple "pick up and play"
-> There are many 2-player games vying for attention

Played a demo copy at Wonko's Toys and Games.  I thought the placement of the mutant goats in relation of attacking your opponent was an interesting idea, and I really enjoyed the playful card art.  I would be interested in trying out a 2-team game.

Mutant goats attacking each other to defeat the opposing shepherd. The game is a 1 vs 1 combat game like many others but with a couple of differences: the goats' position is important as they attack in a straight line against the goat opposite them, and also, when you attack it doesn't resolve until the start of your next turn, so your opponent gets a chance to respond and do things to mess you up. The game itself was fun, but the rulebook could use some work and I'm not sure it's different enough to other similar games to stand out.

Haven't really found anyone willing to dive into this with me, can be nice but seems to result in draggy matches until one side draws a workable card combination, at least that how it feels at this experience level.

I have to admit, I wanted Gruff because of the art, and I love goats. But having delved into Gruff, I found gameplay that I have not been able to get tired off. I love the customization of it, the back and forth, and even after playing so many times, I still get surprised. Easily my favorite game in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun play on a deckbuilder and magic the gathering esque cardgame, with a crazy concept that is ridiculous enough to be enjoyable. I personally feel like the game could use a bit more guidance in what gruffs to use in your deck as new players will struggle to find what combos work best.

I absolutely love this game. The replayabilty is fantastic. Unique mechanics make it stand out from the crowd of all the other card games on the market. I also like the way expansions (so far) are being handled as stand alone versions with a lot of new content. I kickstarted this project and have not been disappointed since recieving it. Cant wait to get my hands on the first expansion and (hopefully) many more to come! Simple enough for casual gamers but also complex enough for tournament competitors. And I havent even mentioned the awesome illustration...love it!

Decent 2-player battle with a very entertaining theme. The goats and shepherds are goofy, their decks are interesting and play well off each other, but the gameplay game can drag as you go back and forth trying to build toward stronger effects. The components are average, the counters come off the cards rather easily when you "tap" them and the thin cards all warp. Also, the mini is low quality and a waste of space.

The rules lack precision, and a lot of questions could, either not be answered by going through the rulebook, or required a lot of pages to turn.

The draft system seems to allow every shepherd and every Gruff during set-up. This is too helpful for the first player, as Capri is extremely powerful, and, once a player is comfortable enough with a 3 Gruff team, it doesn't give them a reason to try anything else. I would advise randomly drawing three to five Gruffs per player, and then actually drafting them. Randomly drawing two shepherds per player, and drafting them facedown should be better as well.

As for the game itself, first play was like playing a tempo deck against mono-blue... and we choose the Gruffs for their art. So very painful, long, and annoying. A lot of "return this to your hand", "steal this from you" and "You're attacking? How cute. I do this, this and that, and now you've just lost your last five turns".

The attacking system in itself, albeit interesting, makes the game slow, and it makes attacking quite dangerous. I'd rather it be "I'll attack, do you have an effect? No? Well then, take X damage". As it is, it's more like. I'll attack. Have a whole turn to make it be to my huge disadvantage. While it opens possibilities in itself, it seemed like a very bad move when we played it.

Am yet to understand the resource management of the game, and while I did put high cost cards in my deck last time, I played it too much like I play M:tG : Wheenie White and low-cost cards. Well, it didn't work, thank you.

I'm concerned about the balance, as the author himself said some decks simply cannot win. This seems like a design flaw to me. As I'm only one play through, I'll reserve judgement on that.

The artwork is gorgeous, I enjoy the format of the box (but remove the insert from the top lid if you don't want your big cards damaged). I like how the Gruff cards act as separators. The sliders tend to fall from the cards once they're sleeved, though.

Not a big fan of the mini, and it's actually of the Gruff I like the least, but since it's free, it's a nice gift from the author.

Overall, a very nice looking game, which seemed a bit slow and amateurish on our first play, a bit in the lines of Star Realms and Epic in terms of "I see what you're doing here, but it still needs quite a bit of work"

Creators are very kind, listen to people a lot, and really pay attention to their customers.

I used to play MTG. This has some essence from it, but remaining the combos as the main goal of the game. And the chance to set up a 4 player mini-contest in a few moments makes it really interesting.  

>>>Edit: I've just played once by now, and we chose the 4 player version (2 vs 2) which now I'm sure is not the best way to first play this game. It took us about 2 hours, but I'm pretty sure in further plays it will be less than this.

I recommend to sleeve all the cards in this game. You'll need 229 MTG size sleeves (for the deck) and 22 65X100 size sleeves (for the goats and the shepherds). If you take off the foam insert it will fit everything in the box (also the mini and the clips).

Just waiting to do a 1v1 play. 

>>>2n edit: After my first 1v1 play ( 70 minutes with a noob) I must say that I love this game. Just waiting to have the moment to try it again. 

>>>3rd edit: Played again 1vs1 and I feel that as I learn more about the cards and the combos I Like it more and more... I recommend playing it with players with the same level as yours.

Great game with plenty of replay value. This game suites me as a competitive card gamer, and my wife as a casual gamer. On a previous review someone stated that the sliders come off easily, which I have to disagree with. Without sleeves the sliders are firm and as long as you remember that there are sliders on the cards they stay on fine. When sleeved the sliders are perfectly snug and can be handled rather carelessly and the sliders stay on. 

Artwork: 10/10 - This game has gorgeous art. From the formatting of the cards to the coloration on the back of the cards and finally the masterpiece that are the gruffs and shepherds themselves these ares are beautiful. 

Gameplay: 10/10 - This game has intense replay value. The game starts slow so that you have time to plan out your turns and then snowballs into an all out brawl. For someone who hates 10 minute games AND doesnt have time for a 2 hour investiment this game is a great game timing wise. The deck building is light but in depth forcing you to think ahead to not only what your playing but what your opponent it playing. Additionally it allows for you to combine gruffs to get more out of each gruff. 

Packaging: 10/10 - The creator put a lot of thought into the box and it shows. One you take out the miniature and the foam all the cards fit while in sleeves with only finger room to spare (so you can actually pull the cards out). Additionally the sliders are wonderful and unlike other sliders I have seen (aka Betrayal at the house on the hill) they stay on the cards rather well without damaging the cards. 

Overall: 10/10 - I have a decent game collection(100+ games) and this by far gets played the most. It has overtaken MtG as our "Go to" game.

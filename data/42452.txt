Rattus is a well thought game that has an unique feel to it. You often face situation in which you have to risk hurting yourself if you want to slow others down. The special powers obtained from the characters seem to be of rather situational benefit with lasting potential of adverse effects. This limits their attractiveness which is a double edged sword. On the other hand you always have to evaluate the situation carefully which is good, but the downside is that you see fewer creative plays which limits the fun. Anyways, Rattus is a solid game with no apparent flaws.

RATING: 6
A fun game.  It's not overly deep but then you wouldn't want it to be with a theme like that. There is more than enough going on to make it interesting even if there is also a lot of randomness to it.

I think the king and knight card are very powerful at the start of the game and the witch and monk at the end.

The expansions look fun.  Looking forward to trying them out.

1st play: This game made very little sense.  The plague mechanic seems pretty arbitrary, and the strategy seems to be "Don't have too many cubes on the board" and the way to win is to put cubes on the board.  I did very poorly though, so it's very possible I really just didn't understand the objective of the game.

No 2nd play.

[With Pied Piper + the Essen Bonus]

Good with the expansion to give it some replay legs.  Without the expansion would get old fast; with, there's a very quick, quite fun game here.  And, despite the fast fast play with 2 (not sure how well the whole thing works with more) it's still a satisfying game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple and light family game of cube (VP) accumulation and removal. The clever use of various powers to assist and/or to hinder adds to the game play.

The theme suits this style of game very well without making it too dark.

The replay ability goes only as far as the familiarity of the number of rat-tokens and their effects being memorized by veteran players.

An excellent game nevertheless.

Rattus made hardly any impression on me.  It felt largely  random and gave me hardly anything to think about. The roles add something, although some seem clearly better than others.  I'm fond of interactive games and Rattus at least has a fair degree of that.  It also plays pretty quickly with little downtime.

Production quality is good; I especially liked the big chunky role tiles.  The artwork is rather dull, featuring an awful lot of brown.

RATING: 8
Another game I look at is a higher, purer type of strategy. The theme of the game actually works for me strange as that is. The real star of the game for me though is that taking roles makes you stronger, but more likely to lose people to the plague, and you cannot voluntarily lose a role you have taken. Brilliant.

Great game! Love the theme. Short playthroughs (~45 minutes for a four player game), easy to teach, easy setup, good "screwage" interaction between players, some allowance for tactical decision making while not causing significant analysis paralysis. Wonderful game.

Thematic game (=reason why I bought it) about the black death and middle ages. The rules are fairly straight forward, but for some reason, it seems to miss something for me.

RATING: 5
Reasonable production and box size.  Found the rules readable and concise, but there seemed to be just enough exceptions to have new players constantly asking questions about the order of actions, how many cubes/rats get added, etc.  First-party player aids would have been much appreciated.  Game-wise I think it's serviceable, unexceptional, and a decent subject of optimization conversation.  The primary mechanic is leader-bashing, and I think it's not apparent from initial plays how easy it is to spare yourself trouble by intentionally activating plague on your own regions when it doesn't rate to affect you.  Might like it more if it was a guaranteed 30m or less, which I think is achievable with some (but far from all) groups.

RATING: 8
A game about the Black Plague.  It's interesting that controlling an area seems less important than in other games as you want to just have the most cubes on the board.  I like the variable role selection.  There seems to be a bit too much randomness, but next time I play, it might help to think of it as more of a push your luck game.  I need to play again with more than two.

SECOND PLAY: Much better with more than 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Sometimes when you enter into a game you expect something serious and other times something silly.  Rattus will land you somewhere smack in the middle.  The premise of the game is the plague and your goal is to keep as many of your people alive as possible.  Its a dark and somewhat gruesome thought.  Add in the somewhat historical aspects of the roles and you have the making of a game of fighting off doom.  But this dark nature is off set by remarkably simple game play and a healthy dose of random tile draws and you find that you can't really take all of it all that seriously.  In the end, the game is a longer filler that is a nice choice for area control fans, but not one that will quench the area control strategists needs.  Let it be a light game and enjoy it for what it is.

A mean game, but also a short one. It's not hours of backstabbing... it lasts as long as it should.

Also, it's a great push-your-luck game, and its random factor is even a bit mitigated by the witch role. I really like it. Too bad my wife would probably hate it; if not, I would have bought it.

UPDATE: After my initial reaction, and several more plays into it, I still like it, but not as much as I did before. Down to a 7, mainly due to the huge luck impact.

This game is quite light, but has a short and easy-to-teach ruleset, leading to simple and fast gameplay. It is not so strategical, because of the luck factor intrinsic in the rat tokens mechanic, but it's an enjoyable little tactical game, for the whole family. The production is definitely good: the cardboard is thick and durable, and the artwork quite enjoyable.

RATING: 7.5
A fun, quick playing game.  Without an expansion it is the same roles every time and one strength of the game (with an expansion or two) is how different each game will play as the different roles radically add variety to the game (a la dominion).  Even without an expansion this is still a decent game with a high level of interaction.  People have complained that there is little depth and it is too light but to me I can see layers to the game and its true luck will play a significant role but you can do a lot to increase and manipulate your chances.  E.g. create a situation where someone wants to attack your opponents rather than you.

I wanted to give this one a shot because I heard it was reasonably simple to teach and yet had some really interesting decisions. Well everything I heard was right and then some. This game is a neat balancing act of trying to flood the board with your pieces while simultaneously having them kicked back to you again and again. The rules are indeed totally straightforward, so by the 2nd or 3rd turn it becomes second nature. Yet the strategies are unique, and there's several things to think about. You have to not only concentrate on getting your pieces on the board, but also on how you will move the plague around the board. The different special roles add a lot of interest to the game as well. It's cool how you want all the abilities but each one you take increases your odds of losing cubes. You can make some great combos if you get the right abilities together. In fact in the first game we played of this I figured out one combo that almost gave me a massive come-from-behind victory. My only complaint is that the constant ebb-and-flow of the cubes on the board can almost make you feel like "why did I even waste my time?!"  When I sit back and think about it, I wonder if anything I do on my early turns even matters all that much.  However, I still like exploring the game, and expect it will be in my collection for a long time.

Lasting Impressions:
----------------------
This is one of my favorite games.  I love how many roles there now are, and I also think this game is fun with 3, 4, and 5 players (with the expansion).  This game also has infinite replayability if you grab all the expansions that are out there.  I think what keeps me from making it a 10 is just how chaotic the game can get, which isn't horrible since the game is short, but there are some games where it feels like you had zero chance to pull of a victory.  One of the coolest area control games ever made!

RATING: 6.26
Good quality production (Z-man). Simple rules to read and explain. Plays v.quickly. Has some depth (not brain-burning) but might become staid after repeated plays so probably one to dip in and out of over time.  All in all a nicely themed filler. Enjoyable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A must-buy due to good ratings here and because of the pair of designers, who designed  what may be my wife's favourite game, Oregon.

After one play, I must be missing something that other people are seeing.  Seemed two-thirds of the rats never hurt us, because we couldn't get enough cubes onto the board.  A large proportion of the rats were 5+ and 6+, but good luck getting 5 or 6 cubes into the same region.

I played an extra two games, and the last game I could finally start to see some clever plays.  But it was also my wife's first game of this and she didn't even want to finish.

I think the game is probably rewarding if you stick with it and play a half-dozen times.  If you're like me, and think the game has to be fun at first to make you even want to play it that many times, I'd recommend avoiding.  You won't miss the game.

RATING: 6.5
A short, fun, portable area control game with some fun mechanics. However, the people I played it with (who also liked the game) seemed to think they had unlocked an unbeatable strategy--and since one of them won using it, I'm not certain they were wrong.

I'd be willing to play again to test that theory, or to see if the expansions, in bringing in new characters roles, shake up the game enough to avoid a killer strategy. If my friends were correct, however, that means that Rattus, while fun, is sort of broken. Hence my current rating.

RATING: 8
This area control/survival game surpassed my expectations. Rattus can be taught in just a few minutes and the game only takes between 20-45 minutes, depending on the number of players. The game is a meaty filler, and one of the best in the category that I have played. The role mechanic is a blast: Getting the benefits that specific roles provide is always extremely tempting, but the more roles you have the more susceptible you become to the plague. And you can only get rid of a role if another player takes it from you, which leads to some very interesting and meaningful choices. 
Plays very well with 2, and even better with 3-4.
I hope Rattus does not get overlooked, as it's one of my favorite games of 2010.

It's a Euro! Elegant rules, interesting but simple mechanics, great looking components, a pasted on theme... I like everything about it!  The Witch is probably the only role that seems weak, but I imagine there are key swaps that could wreak opponents... but if you take witch you're probably stuck with her for the whole game because she just doesn't seem that strong.  The Peasant seems to be the best role in my mind, but my opponents really liked the King.  I can't wait to try this with more people.

Played once with a mix of expansions (a camel, two universities). Afterwards I was told by a friend the base game alone is more enjoyable. I don't know if it'll come to a replay ever again. I found it a frustrating luckfest not helped by the fact I came in last by a wide margin without any indication how I would have fared better given the circumstances.

I get that it's a light game and I see how choosing where to play plague tokens and where to expand your people is a fun little puzzle, but the additional roles make it far too swingy. There's a game to be found in the mechanics, but not a fun one in its current state. Definitely catered to the not-so-die-hard gamer.

Filler with very little of control (at least with more than 2 playing). If felt too luck driven and chaotic for me, and some bits of the theme didn't work (for me), specifically you can place people based on the number of rats in the area ... umm, err... and what the player was actually representing in the game.

All in all an abstract with a theme added. I'd play it (especially as it's quick) but no desire to own a copy.

RATING: 8
Part of me is ambivalent, and part of me thinks there's a great game here.  Short playtime, kind of fun theme.  My problem is I think the strategies are a bit unbalanced.  The one that always wins out in our games is laying low, spreading out, getting your cubes in the kingdom, avoiding taking actions/roles.  I've never seen an aggressive strategy win the game, making about two or three or the roles unpopular, or at worst, useless.

But I want to keep playing.  If I'm proven wrong, this one could be a true gem.

Juego sencillo que puede satisfacer a jugones y no jugones por igual. Recuerda un poco al grande, por aquello de los cubos esparcidos y tener que evaluar mayorías. Cada vez que colocas población en un territorio, hay que incluir también fichas de ratas en las zonas adyacentes. En cada turno se activa una zona y se desvelan el contenido de las fichas de ratas... que pueden afectar o no  a la población del territorio. Gana el jugador que consiga sobrevivir a la epidemia con mayor cantidad de cubitos (población) en el tablero.
Durante el juego, hay que ir seleccionando determinados roles que te permiten gestionar los cubos de determinadas maneras. Las fichas de ratas afectan a los jugadores que estén en posesión de determinado/s rol/es.
Sencillo, rápido y muy entrentenido. Recomendable.

Fun, relatively quick game. In our 6-player game luck didn't seem to have an overly big influence, that is, unfortunately until the final round where the rats get flipped in every country. It seemed to be generally close going into this round and then all of a sudden it seemed almost completely arbitrary who got wiped out and who was virtually untouched.

From other players, they said the 6-player game was fairly chaotic, so I would be interested to try this again with say 4 people. Still though, certainly fun to be had and the game didn't overstay its welcome.

A different kind of plague game, where the players get to decide where infections break out. Has some familiar mechanics with role selection and placement of cubes. But nice twists on both of these mechanics makes for a fun game of survival in plague-filled Europe. Challenging tactical play as the grim reaper changes the landscape after every turn. Not sure yet about the King character being very effective, after only one play. And I got the witch early, and had it most of the game. Most plays are logged with the expansion cards.

Also includes the four promo cards for a total of 22 character cards for play with the Pied Piper expansion.

Fun area majority game with special cards and their powers to spice up the game. Game play is very intuitive and easy to catch up and there are interesting desicions to be made in each round.

Resolving plaque is the only area of the game which is not so intuitive but you don't really have to know much more than it's not a good thing to have influence in areas with lots of plaque tokens in it to enjoy the game.

Three plays in, my enthusiasm is fading. It's clever, but I just don't think there is enough game. It's really just a random whack-your-neighbor fest.

A few play in, I'm not sure. Rattus is clever, clean and fast-playing. But it's also a little thin on the ground; I don't feel like there is really a whole lot of game here. Two of my games involved thee-way ties. There just isn't a whole lot of maneuver room, people can see your score, and they whack whoever has the most cubes on the board, and there just isn't a whole lot you can do about it. It's a neat little game, but I think it needed another idea, a little more depth. I purchased it, and was somewhat disappointed.

This game is certainly different than anything I've played before.  Perhaps the most interesting thing are the character abilities.  Choosing characters gives you special abilities, as you would expect.  However, the more characters you currently control, the more likely the plague is going to rough you up a bit!  So, you're always balancing short term gains of the character abilities vs. the risk of losing guys to the plague.

Overall, I thought it was a pretty cool little super-filler.  Very light game play and fairly quick.

Rattus is a fairly simplistic game with an awesome (and sometimes viewed as being gruesome) mechanic.  Who wouldn't want to spread the black death around medieval Europe with the intent of committing color-based genocide?

Honestly, due to the simple nature of the game's mechanics, it does not hit my table quite as often as others.  Still, when you have a hankering for something light, it's a decent option.

It's ok... it felt kind of repetitive. Take that! Then, take that! There is a lot of reacting and attacking others. Some people might take it wrong because of the nature of the game. The character cards are interesting because they change the game play and break the rules. It doesn't take long to play, so I would say a good area control game when time is of the essence.

I really like this different little game, as there's nothing I have that's anything like it.  I sometimes call it the anti-Pandeminc, which is only partially true.  But it's non-coop, and you spread disease instead of curing it.  I like the special role powers, and the fact that you can accumulate them if nobody steals them from you.  Also, having multiple roles can be good, but also increases the probability you'll get hit with disease.  Great little game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rattus is a fairly simple game where the end goal is to keep your 5 mm cubes from being consumed by the ravaging hordes of vicious, blood thirsty, beady eyed, nefarious rats.

On each players turn they can put cubes onto the board in one area equal to the number of rat tiles present there. They then move the plague pawn, put out some more rat tiles, and then flip the rat tiles in the area where the plague pawn is standing. The back of the rat tiles all designate a number of wood cubes, get equal to or above that number, and people start getting eaten alive. Most of these negative effects come to those who have taken a special tile though.

Special tiles are actually where most of the intrigue in the game comes from. They start out in a collective pool and on their turn players are allowed to take one from the pool or one from another player. Each of those tiles allows the player to move things around on the board, rats, people, or to affect the rat tile evaluation, &c. The trick is that each of those tiles also has an icon that can show up on the back of the rat tiles, and the only way to get rid of the things is to have someone else take it from you.

So, if you have a lot of tiles the plus side is that you get all of these cool special powers during your turn. The downside is that when your areas get evaluated you are going to be providing a feast for your friends, the local vermin.

Rattus is a smart design with a lot of expandability because of the way the special character tiles work, but I'm not a particular fan of these lighter-medium type games and I don't find the decisions here engaging enough to draw me back for subsequent plays. In the negative column, I really don't think most of the things that happen in this game are in your control. Rat chits can be a non-factor in a region if you have the right tiles in front of you, or you can get repeatedly battered even in seemingly safe places by their caprice. A lot also rides on whether your opponents keep coveting your special power chit(s) as being able to use them is very useful, but being stuck with more than 1 can be very bad; ergo, the ideal of using one and then having someone else grab it before a region scores.

Where is the game in this title supposed to be hiding? Place tokens nearly at random (the Witch allows for a very modest amount of control), and kill off other players in a sort-of hopeful fashion. That is Rattus. I saw no need to play the game to completion, getting bored after six or seven rounds; if this is supposed to be the 'next big hamburger thing' of 'today's fast food economy' where according to the publisher 'gamers are already looking forward to the next release the moment a title is made available', then I'll stick to a wholesome diet with fibres, vitamins, and carefully chosen nutritional value. Might not be as filling, but I'd rather keep myself in shape. The game might improve with the expansion, but to be honest I'm not at all interested in finding out.

[b]Update[/b] The above was written while keeping in mind a slightly earlier interview with WGG's owner in which he set forth his disparaging view on the boardgame market. Customers weren't interested in depth and replayability, they just wanted to play a few quickie games before moving on to the next game. The terminology of hamburgers and fast food is his. Since Rattus isn't a deep game... you get the idea.

Many years later I gave Rattus another chance, and discovered that there is slightly more to the game than meets the eye. Yes, the rat chits are annoyingly random. The consequence is that the entire game gravitates towards timely use of the character cards which allow some escape of their capricious effects. Thus various approaches in securing victory are possible, but once you figure them out the game turns very, very samey all the same; in part because of the massive inpredictability of the rats. So while I'm inclined to up the rate to a 4, the absolutely avoidable limitations of but 6 characters in the base game bring the game down to a 3 again.

That said, the game is a personal favourite of the publisher and consequently has been supported by tons of expansions over the years. If you like Rattus, those are in my opinion an absolute must to keep matters fresh and engaging.

The theme is not deeply ingrained in this game, but it's at least a unique way to portray a dark moment in history.  It feels like the opposite of an area majority game - area minority, perhaps?  There is also role selection with the twist that you can't get rid of a role unless someone else selects it.

Each round tiles are revealed in various European areas, and players holding certain roles lose population, and often whomever has the majority.  So there is a distinct advantage trying to have just a bit less than everyone else.  But to win you need the most people alive at the end of the game.

Very interesting - light and fast, I'd happily play this again.

Another game with an original theme; this time the Black Plague of the Dark Ages.  However, this is a fairly light euro with a lighthearted approach to the theme - it would be an apporopriate game for kids as well.  Nice multiplayer interaction for such a relatively simple and quick game; the downside is there is a strong random factor of how deadly each plague is - leaders tend to suffer simply for being more successful in producing population I feel, and "Gang Up on the Leader" is an inevitability here.  A fun light game for 3 or 4 that could be played in an hour or less.

In medieval Europe the players try to have their population survive the Black Death. During your turn you place a number of blocks (population) in one of the regions, then you place some rat tokens in the neighbouring region(s). Then the rat token(s) in the region where you placed your population are resolved. First the population limit is checked. If the population is lower, then nothing happens. If it is equal or higher than the limit a number of blocks have to be removed. Who has to remove one block depends on the symbols on the rat token. It can be all players, or the one with most blocks in this region, and furthermore it can be the one who owns one of the 6 characters (king, knight, monk, farmer, trader, witch). These characters each have a special property which the players can use at any time during their turn. The king for example can move 1 block from a region where there are no rats to a safe haven (the palace), the monk can move a rat token to a neighbouring region,...

Jean: Ik speelde gisteren een spel waarbij één van de spelers een SABOTEUR was. Het is de bedoeling dat de SABOTEUR de andere spelers moet saboteren zodat ze het goud niet kunnen vinden. En ik had de eer om met de SABOTEUR  te mogen spelen. Het was echt een leuk SABOTEUR spel. Ik denk dat de titel van het spel “de zoektocht naar het goud” was?

Marie: Goed, maar vandaag spelen we Rattus. Steek je broekspijpen maar al in je sokken.

Jean: Pfff… ik haat Rattus.

The game offers several strategies to explore, eg, flooding the board with cubes, controlling the plague piece, and moving the tokens or cubes around a lot. However, the central mechanism, namely, turning over the tokens, injects quite a bit of luck into the proceedings, so I am not sure how much you can affect your fate by strategizing. The plague infection at the end also can nullify much of the strategy that you may have employed over the course of the game.

Players are trying to keep their population cubes on the board while the plague ravages medieval Europe.  Simple game where players place cubes on the board, then move the plague bearer one region - placing rat tokens on the board and triggering a plague in that region.  Plagues are resolved by flipping rat tokens in a region which "randomly" remove players cubes.  Players also have the option to take one of six characters, which grant them a power, but make them more susceptible to plague.  Most cubes on the board at the end of the game wins.  Simple stuff, but works well, if you don't mind the seemingly random game play.  If it has a fault, it appears to go on about 15 minutes too long.

Quick, clever abstract masquerading as a "dark ages, spreading the disease" game, this is one of my favorite games of the last few years.

Wow....this game really surprised me!  They pack alot into a small package.  Although the subject matter is a little dark...black death and all that...they still managed to make this light and fun.  Don't get aced out of going for the power cards early, you will be playing catch up for the rest of the game.  One caution, warn people going in that it is a real take that kind of game, once that is understood you will have a blast.

Light and fast-paced game which is driven by character selection with special powers.   There's a fair amount of luck, but the wide variety of special powers (with the expansion) seems to make replayability very high.   This has some of the same appeal to me that games like Magical Athlete or Cosmic Encounter have, albeit in a more Euro-ized setting.   I enjoyed it.

Kipróbáltuk a 3 fős változatot és hát röviden, nem váltotta be a hozzá fűzött reményeket. Egyszerű szabályokkal rendelkező, alapvetően terület foglalós játék, ami meg van fűszerezve a szerepkártyákkal. A játékidő rövid, ez pozitívum. A játékról röviden, a középkorban játszódik, amikor a fekete halál elérte európát. Kis kockák jelképezik  a népességet, s a játék ezeknek a kis kockáknak a menedzseléséről szól, a különböző szerepkártyák segítségével, melyekből minden körben szerezhetünk egyet, akár egymástól is. A járványt egy a játékosok által irányított járványbábú és a terjedő patkány lapkák szimulálnak jól. Ahol a járványbábú felbukkan, ott a járvány kitör és a patkány lapkák felfordítása és értelmezése után megkezdődik a lakosság tizedelése :). Egymással kiszúrós jellege miatt sértődősöknek nem ajánlott. Ami még feltűnt, hogy hiányzik belőle a sikerélmény. Sikerül valahová nagy nehezen felpakolni egy pár kockát, majd jön a járvány és megmarad belőle egy-kettő. Kissé lélek romboló :). A feleségem egyébként külső szemlélőként megállapította, hogy a játék a San Marco-ra hasonlít leginkább. Azt is csak kipróbáltuk, de hamar lemondtunk róla, mert nem a mi ízlésvilágunk, ami erre a játékra is igaz valószínűleg. Mindkettőt meg kellene tanulni játszani, hogy felismerjük a szépségét. Azonban mi úgy éreztük, hogy a Rattus-ból valahogy hiányzik az a plusz, amitől sikeres játék lehetne, legalábbis a mi családunkban. (2014.09.25.)

RATING: N/A
Played friend's copy. I finally got my answers to all my skeptics on this game. There have been many incident where I stumbled upon this game before. Read the reviews, Ender's comprehensive review, video reviews, and finally the rule book. Frankly speaking, I wasn't blown away, really.

Each time I saw this title while reading, recommended, or in the forums, I tried to pretend it's not there (darn, I'm that cruel). Obviously because of the reasons above. Boy, how I was wrong, that it became one of my biggest mistake.

It's another small-box-but-mind-blowing game. Filled with strategy, screw-your-opponent tactic, fast&quick gameplay, and some important decision-making. Not to forget, low downtime during player's turn, and on the light side for it's rules. I hope I'm saying this for everyone else who played tonight.

This game is about you trying to save your surviving population from the black death plague that happened in Europe, circa 1347. Every turn you will need to choose and place in front of you, one of the available roles (game starts with 6), which will grant you a special ability, Mind you that these role cards have cumulative effect where it will stays with you if no one else take it from you. Meaning, you can have plenty of role cards before you, if no one else interested with the roles that you've chosen. Sounds nice? Well, this can actually have a major drawback as your population will be more vulnerable by the plague. This is because, the plague affects you as what you are (what role you chose), apart from who's the majority in a region and one that affect all present players in a region. Remember, the winner is the one who can save more of his/her population at the end of the game.

Every decision that you make during your turn has an impact to other players. This is what made us glued to our seats during the entire game. It's exciting to watch what players are trying to do during their turn. Lucky that the downtime was pretty low.

I'm not a heavily experience gamer but I have to say that this game feels a bit, if not much like Hansa Teutonica. It's a cube-pushing game, with pretty much low on the interaction, or what I used to call, a silent game. Although, I stated a silent game, that actually didn't happen during our session. I guess you have to try it to know what I meant.

Also, I don't feel the Rattus: Pied Piper expansion is mandatory for the game. I believe the basic game is already great, can give plenty of fun, enough to satisfy strategy craves out there. But, just like Hansa Teutonica: East Expansion, I do feel like it's necessary if you're bored playing with the same crowd, that use the same old strategy as starters. Still, I think it's still a long way to go to reach that situation in my opinion.

Enough said, Rattus has become one of my favourite for a quick strategy game (even with only 2 play). 

[b]Probably will hold my plan to own this game as area control game tend to get unplayed in my collection.

Purchased on a whim after reading a bit of buzz about the game.  It's like nothing else we own!  You are zipping about the map trying to score points before the rats carrying a plague come and wipe you out.  It's so fun and fast and come on, it's rats carrying the plague!

Next time we play, my husband suggested that instead of keeping track of the survivors, we should score how many people the rats killed over the course of the game.  Also, count the little meeples in millions. Seems to make more sense theme wise if you saved 9 million instead of 9.

I saw people gave Rattus lower ratings...  but I really enjoyed it a lot.  For such a fast game (~30 minutes), there is a ton of strategy and tactics. It's one of those games that is very easy to teach and could be played by anyone, but can be enjoyed even by a seasoned strategist.  

The pieces and the artwork are also very nice.  It is a great, quick, pickup game.  If only it were a bit cheaper...

[1 play] Pleasant, gruesomely themed Euro.  I liked the mechanism of the roles that stay with you until someone else chooses them (like Start Player in Agricola).

I should play this again, but I don't think any of us really got the best impression from this game.  It's a quick, cutthroat Euro.  The strategies aren't clear from the onset and probably take a few plays to develop.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A fast, relatively light Euro with some direct conflict nastiness mixed in. Plays fast - my first play was with two moderately AP-prone gamers, and we still managed to finish under an hour. The perfect length game for when you want something slightly heavier than a filler, but not too complex or long.

The randomness of the rat tokens might frustrate players who like complete control over their destiny, but it is mitigated by the variety of ways in which the character cards can be used. A fun blend of role selection, area control and push-your-luck.

Can you survive the Black Death? A quick-playing strongly tactical and interactive light euro, suitable for families, easy to learn and fun to play, offering significant interaction, an interesting theme, and good components.  Works well but limited replayability for gamers without the expansion.  A real battle for survival, so there's little sense of development or building something up, and sometimes you're not much further ahead at the end of the game than the middle - does it matter when it ends? (perhaps slight advantage to player who triggers end?).  See my pictorial review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/614680

Very Light area control game with role selection.  The box says it takes about 45 minutes to play, and even my very first game, with rules explanation and reading took exactly that.  I would not have thought role selection would work in an area control game, but this disproves that.

Fun lighthearted game in which you're trying to move your pieces around the board and group together with other people so they won't kill your pieces.  Very interesting gameplay, but you'll need new roles/expansions to keep the game fresh.

I love area majority games, El Grande being one of my favorites. Rattus feels a bit like El Grande light, and packs a lot of gaming goodness into 45 minutes.  I like the way a special role card can be taken each round, and how the game self balances between the various powers as the roles people think are the best get taken away from other people the most. It can feel a tad chaotic with the random distribution of the various rat tokens that may or may not affect the cubes in their region, but it doesn't bother me too much. I see myself pulling this out with people new to the hobby a lot.

Könnyed stratégiai játék, amiben azért elég nagy szerepe van a szerencsének. Érdekes a szerepválasztós mechanizmus, nomeg kuriózum az téma, hogy életben kell tartani a pestisben az embereidet. Nagyon gyorsan tanulható, és gyorsan le is megy játék.

Kicsit ráuntam. Nincs sok döntési helyzet, túl nagy a szerencse szerepe. Az africanus se sokat változtat a játékmeneten. Bevezettük, hogy mindig eggyel kisebb térképen játszunk, így valamivel izgalmasabb a játék, mert több a halálozás.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The thematic background of Rattus, spreading the Black Plague across Europe, is a bit odd for a family game, yet that's what the game is.

Each player has a contingent of people who are, primarily, prospective plague victims. They get placed in various regions on the board, and when they die they return to their owner's supply. The player with most people on the board at the end of the game wins.

A game turn is pretty simple: Place people, optionally select one of the special roles which grant extra powers but also make you more vulnerable to plague effects, and spread the plague to any region adjacent to where it currently festers. When the plague spreads it causes all rat tiles in the new region to be turned over and triggers their effects. These effects are the focal point of the game. Most of the roles can affect the results in one way or another but ultimately control is rather limited and the random tile distribution is the most decisive factor.

That's a litte unfortunate since the game is fairly tactical otherwise.

The comparisons to Pandemic are not readily apparent to me. This plays completely differently.  It is a short, press your luck, action drafting game.  The twist of this game is that the action cards provide key benefits, but also trigger the plague in your flipped regions.  Feels a bit shallow for long term play - the decisions largely seem obvious at times.  Still, it plays quick and has some nice player interaction.

After a year and a half on the shelf, I finally play a three player game, and am impressed.  There is a lot more game in this box than I thought there would be.  First impressions are good, the theme strangely works, the bits are nice, and the brain hurts just a little.  Its a very good game (Rating 8.123, Jan 15). UPDATE: Maybe it depends on the gaming group, but doesn’t work with the lighter gamers (Rating 7.476, May 2015)

Awesome birthday present from the great Lady Jen, 2012

Normally a game with this kind of chaos wouldn't totally grab me, but I like the idea that you are trying to keep as far away from the terrible chaos pockets as possible. This leads to more tactical play than simply just keeping your fingers crossed. I like the special roles in this game, where taking a role can help you here but harm you somewhere else. Little neat things like that keeps this one interesting. I'm sure it'll be more interesting with more players.

I enjoyed my first play, but I'm not sure what the strategy should be.  I think I got saddled with too many roles, and as a result lost a lot more cubes to the disease.  I'll need to play this again to really understand it.  It's quick, it's light, and I enjoyed the simple rules though.

Reminds me of Kingdom builder in some ways, but I think I like it better.  It really comes down to how you utilize the roles.  Have only played this with 2 players at a time and am curious how it would play with more.  With 2, you're getting a lot of combos from the roles.  With more, you'd have fewer roles per turn and it would really change the dynamic.  Nice game.  Definitely captures the thematic feel of the plague ravaging Europe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Too random and too nasty for my taste. Luckily it doesn't take much to play it so the time/fun ratio is OK. I like the graphics but I have this feeling that the game was not tested thouroughly enough - the role cards seem unbalanced and very differ in power. The same gripe goes to the add-on - many new cards but somehow very few are useful and some are too powerful (at least in my opinion).

I played it only a few times so I may be terribly wrong. Somehow I don't want to check it out though...

Quick tactical game of tit-for-tat in medieval Europe fighting the plague and your fellow players.  Actually there is more strategy than first appears, leavened with a bit of luck and a bit of take-the-leader-down.

Distilled El Grande. I like the roles people can choose to give them more options of things to do, and the fact that each role you take increases the odds of you being hit by the plague. Neat game.

RATING: 8
It appears to be area of control, but it's really a wargame of movement to and fro across the map, sustaining casualties only to put more people out. The variable player cards keep things interesting. At first, the king seemed overpowered and we fought for control over it. I then realized the power of the peasant to dump more cubes on the board. We didn't even play the witch card the first game, only to find that it adds immensely to the strategy. Many ways to play and I can't wait to see what else works.

RATING: 7
Hard for me to decide if there is enough deep strategic thinking in Rattus for my initially high opinion to remain over time. As it stands, a clear go-to first area majority game. A silly theme that lends itself to great table talk, banter, backstabbing, etc. Love the interaction. Love the ease of play. Love how quick it is. Love the clever moves you can piece together with the different special roles.

An area control game, Rattus uses its theme well as players want to be solitary and in small groupings to survive. This plays opposite to most area control games in a nice way. On the downside, actions feel arbitrary. Rat tokens are mostly unknown and the only strategy seems to be push your luck to get all the cubes out or just hope that rat tokens on your areas will not hurt you. There is a start of an interesting game here, but I would have like to see more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Though I'm still figuring out the subtleties of this game, I don't know if my rating will go up or down with more plays.  Either greater depth will reveal itself with new strategies proving equal in their likelihood of being winning ones, else the winning strategies i've discovered thus far will be all it has to offer and the game will become predictable.  So far, so good though and with the expansion introducing a whole variety of new role cards, perhaps the limited strategies will only be limited by which roles you play with for each for each game individually.
---
In the end, I think the real flaw of this game is that it seems broken with 2 players.  Or maybe just less fun.

Light, funny and reasonably short beer & pretzels game (actually an "Ärgerspiel" but I don't know how to translate that to English).  There's not much depth or strategy here and the playing time is more in the 30-40 minutes range.  On a single you turn you basically do only three things: 

1) Fetch a role card which grants you some rather simple extra-powers
2) Put 1-4 new, own cubes (aka people) in one country.
3) Spread the disease, i.e. add rat-chits to one or more countries and let the disease break out in another country by turning over rat-chits, hopefully eliminating as many cubes from other players as possible
4) Repeat until there are no more rat chits left.  Player with most cubes left on the map wins.

All this plays smooth and is fun as long as you don't take the game too seriously.   And be prepared to get screwed several times :-)

RATING: 5
Unique theme, look and game play, to be sure.  But in our house, it tends to play the same from one game to the next, and in the end it's just not that compelling.  Flip over rat tokens, remove your little colored wooden cubes from the board accordingly.  Count the number left at the end and the person with the most is the winner.  One advantage is that, if everyone is paying attention, turns can be completed in around a minute, so the game can move (and end) quickly.  So we do break it out occasionally when we don't have much time but don't want to play King of Tokyo. (Bottom line: I'm not much of a Euro fan)

This is one of my girlfriend's favourites and I really enjoy it too. There's nothing else like it in my collection and the blend of head-scratching tactics and fun is just right. A really enjoyable game, but in no way worth the inflated UK price tag - no way this game is worth £40 in the UK for what you get. Luckily I got someone to pick it up for me for considerably less from the US. Over pricing of imports seems to be a problem that is getting worse here.

RATING: 7
A very light area control game, Rattus does a good job of matching mechanics to theme and creating interesting decisions each turn. Players try to keep their populations as large as possible. Clustered people will breed more, but also attract more rats and thus more disease. It's a fun balancing act that will have you diverting rats towards your opponents in any way possible.

The real hook to the mechanics comes with the various roles. Each turn, you may start by selecting a role. If another player has it, you take it from them. By the start of your next turn, if no one has taken your role, you may keep it and select another. In this way, it is possible to have 2, 3, or even more roles all at once. Each role gives you a powerful ability to aid your population or control the rat population. However, the more roles you have, the more vulnerable you are to the plague. There are times when you will not want to take another role because it is too risky. Other times, you will take a role, knowing that an opponent will likely take it from you the following turn, thus mitigating the risk. It's very easy to grasp and fun to play.

That said, there is a random element that may bother someone looking for a heavier experience. In our plays, scores were often within a point or two of each other, and in a case like that it seems clear that the random element may have determined the winner. I'm not sure how well it would hold up to repeated plays, as you seem to hit a wall where you have mastered the game pretty quickly (a few games or so), thus really leaving the winner up to chance.

This is a short game (maybe 20-30 minutes), but very fun.  The maximum score is 20, so it's pretty tight, and every move is important.  But in the end, there is a lot of randomness with the turning up of the rat tiles, so it's not easy to come up with a strategy.  Maybe it's just a simple filler game, not one that you can analyze to death, and that's why it's fun.

It reminds me a little of Web of Power, but it plays almost like an opposite because the pieces move, and because there is a bit of diplomacy in trying to place pieces with those of other players to avoid the plague (since those players will try to keep the plague marker away from their own pieces).

Fortunatelly there are a ton of direct interaction between the players that of course as always I love. The game has a quite interesting theme by being the the most leftovers on the board set into the dark ages of black plague. The rules are quite simble yet leave enough space for strategic depth. However on the other hand there is also big luck involved. We are collecting majority in each areas by adding wooden cubes onto the board which gives me somewhat similar feeling like i had when i was playing El Grande. Overall i think its a great game for filler purposes but i would prefer a little shorter playtime.

PL: Bardzo prosta gra, wykonana "po spartańsku", co dodaje jej uroku. Rozgrywka jest szybka, przyjemna. Zasady dosyć proste do zrozumienia. Gra polega na mieszaniu szyków innym graczom i ochronie swoich poddanych przed zarazą. Wraz ze wzrostem ilości graczy, pole rozgrywki i zasięg zarazy rozszerzają się - gra dobrze się "skaluje" jak mówi Aga :).

I like that this game takes very short period of time. The main disadvantage is the unbalance of Rat-tokens. I would like that probability of triggering Plague could be higher.

Fairly interesting Euro that feels like a wargame. The capabilities-vs-risk tradeoff is nicely implemented. With the expansion, it's fun to explore the various roles.

RATING: 6
A neat little game with very low rules overhead that makes a good family or gateway game, though there is VERY high screwage so beware as many people could be turned off by this.  

The game keeps you interested and turns are fast, not sure if the game is just a tad long for what it is but its really easy to tweak if so, just remove a few of the tokens before starting with no ill effect whatsoever.  My personal beef with it is just “very limited control”, things can get a little chaotic. There is no real luck however and just a tad of randomness which has very little effect but the player chaos can see some fair size shifts of momentum, note that a leader is pretty easy to spot too and thus essentially gang up on.   

For a game that takes about an hour its mostly inline and good overall, I’m just adverse to chaos most of the time.

Normally I do not comment on games that I have not played 3 or more times.

But this is an exception.

Based on one 4 player game, this is a good game, but not great; there seemed to be little control and too much luck in the game. While I normally do not mind a touch of chaos and luck in any game that is this "weight/duration", it occurred as so random (to me) that it negated any actual plan. Sure, you can increase/limit possibilities, but there are just so many other games out there that I would rather play in this time frame/players/cost. 

Sorry, but I doubt I will play this again - it just did not "grab me" in any way.

Bokkensprong 15/11/13 met Luc, An en Ine. Vrij kort spel; niet zo moeilijk maar wel even kort wennen. Doel: op kaart van Europa zo veel mogelijk blokjes van je eigen kleur kunnen plaatsen. In de verschillende landen liggen echter ook rattenfiches, die een risico betekenen voor het eventueel uitbreken van de pest. Dat gebeurt als iemand in dat land de zwarte pest-pion zet: rattenfiches worden dan omgedraaid en gespeeld, waardoor blokjes mogelijk moeten worden teruggenomen. Je kan ook rollenkaarten nemen die speciale acties mogelijk maken, maar daardoor verhoogt ook het risico dat je getroffen wordt door de pest. Niet slecht, maar ook geen echte hoogvlieger.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2012)

At first I was un impressed with this game, however with many more plays, I have changed my mind and now I appreciate it. The gameplay is rather short and the rules are easy to grasp, it has a lot of unwanted luck in the plague tokens, but I have found that you have room for some strategy. It is rather light but I enjoy it.  Love the theme :D.

This is a very good area control game, I really like that it is not so easy to attack the leader as most games of its kind.

[b]SPOILER ALERT[/b]

I’m worried about the power level of the  ”no character” strategy, and that is the main reason this is not a 7.0 in my book. I read about a variant that you are obliged to pick a character if you don’t have one. I will play with this variant soon. Still I played a good 30 games before I figured it out. 

This is a game I, probably, will buy in the near future. For now I like it a lot, but after 30+ plays, it really needs an expansion.

Survive the black plague!

Short, simple role selection/spatial euro, just the right game length for the game complexity. Interesting twist of getting "stuck" with a character unless someone steals it from you, and being able to take anyone's character you want. Very nicely balanced and designed, with a dynamic game arc of increasing plague danger as the population slowly increases throughout the game. And, I like the simplicity of simply scoring survivors at the end.

RATING: 5
Oregon, the previous game of the Rattus designers, is one of my favourite games so I was looking forward to Rattus. First reports indicated that I might be disappointed and so it was. As with Oregon, player influence seems limited. While more experience with Oregon proved that there is more influence than meets the eye at first sight, I don't have hope for Rattus in this concern. One of the strongest strategies if not the strongest is not to take any special roles as their benefit is outweighed by the increased vulnerability to the plague. Talk about solid game design and testing! Beside that, it is an unfortunate mix of ameritrashy conflict management of getting hit the least and abstract eurogame mechanisms. If you enjoy being in a game for the ride, the tension of random plague token effects in an uncomplicated family game and don't mind direct player targeting, Rattus can be a nice 45 minute filler. It's definitely nothing for the strategy gamer.

I have now played the game enough times to be able to recommend it.  It is a game that requires some thought but is not bogged down with complex rules.  A player turn involves three steps but once the mechanics are understood and become routine the game moves as quickly as players can work out their strategy.  

We took about 45 minutes for three players.  I think the games will get even shorter as we become more familiar with it.

The basic game accommodates up to four players.  I understand adding expansions increases the number of players that can participate, up to six.

Who would have thought The Plague could be fun?

Played twice and much more strategic on the second play once the strengths and weaknesses of each card becomes better understood. A good filler, looking forward to more plays with even more cards from the expansion/promo.

Rating is somewhat tentative.  It seems like the game should hopefully reward experience, as upon first play the results of the plague seem very random.  But I'm guessing that as you gain experience in successfully utilizing the characters that player skill matters more than drawing the right chit.  If that is not the case, my rating will go down.  Initially I like the simplicity and speed of the game, though the game board definitely is very bland and the theme, while original, definitely feels pasted on and arbitrary.

RATING: 7
There are some interesting mechanics in there.  I suspect that once you find a strategy that works for you, you will use it every time you play.  That observation may have more to do with only playing 2 player so far.  It would be a bit harder with three or more.

I like the fact that this game has quite simple rules, however they are different from the rules of other games. For example, all the roles have not only positive effect, but also a negative one and it is not possible to get rid of the role, unless other player takes it from you. And another thing that I enjoy - that it is not that easy to openly play against opponents. Finally, the game is not too long.

Man patiko tai, kad šio žaidimo nesunkios taisyklės, tačiau jos skiriasi nuo kitų žaidimų. Pavyzdžiui tai, kad rolės turi ne tik teigiamą pusę, bet ir neigiamą ir jų neįmanoma atsikratyti, jei kitas žaidėjas jų nepaima. Ir dar vienas mane žavintis dalykas - tai kad, akivaizdžiai kenkti oponentams ne taip jau ir paprasta. Be to žaidimas ne per ilgas.

The game is fine, but really shines with Pied Piper.
Here's my comments for PP:


In my opinion, an incredible addition and quite necessary to the base game...
After a handful of plays, the 6 personalities that shipped with the base game could become scripted in a way...if you understand me. The same basic strategies would exist and it could become a matter of player turn order.

However, Rattus: Pied Piper blows the roof off of that possibility!
The sheer number of possible combinations makes this a must have expansion.
And, the new characters are all good. All have an ability that I would find useful. Some outright obvious, some subtle, some in combo fashion and some situation dependent!

I love it.

Along with Rattus: Essen 2010 Bonus and Rattus: Judge Promo Card this game has shot way up my charts!
For a small game in size, there's a big game in play, awaiting you!

I'm not convinced there is much of a game in Rattus. Seems to me that chaoes, luck and swings of the last turn(s) decide the winner more so than skill. On the plus side however Rattus plays fast even with newbies, downtime is low, people seem to enjoy the theme (the game is surprisingly thematic) and the whole thing just feels weirdly fun. 

Despite Rattus being a decent amount of fun, the best choice in games where the object is to keep your people alive is still The Downfall of Pompeii.

There is not really anything wrong with the game, it's just boring and does not make sense at all with the theme. I know that we screwed up a few rules, but I find it completely illogical to be able to spawn people anywhere on the board. 

f each player were actually a nation and could take advantage of plague in adjacent territories to spread up, it would have been thematically more logical. Else it's just place cubes in random location which are going to be affected by random disasters.

Makes no sense at all.

It would probably be possible to make another game with the same pieces. Like a small conquest game where rats play a great part in the power balance. But as it is, it's just boring.

* Widely diverse tile set of characters make the game feel different each time.

DISLIKES:

* This game can drag if people take time to think about the few options that do exist.  Play this one quickly folks!  :-)  

A bit mixed on the rat discs which introduce a fair bit of randomness into the game as they vary widely in the damage they can cause...particularly the 1+ rat tiles..argh!

This is a real gem of a game. Don't let the morbid theme or simple gameplay deter you from trying this one out. There's an enjoyable, competitive "take that" aspect of removing opponents' population from the board which is balanced with the need to protect your population from that same fate by the hand of others. The different roles provide a good mix of variety but be sure to pick up the Pied Piper expansion for even more options in role selection. A great light/medium weight game that plays quickly. Also makes a good gateway game to introduce others to the hobby.

A great game! So cool that Norwegians designed this. :-) We had a bit of a hard time at first figuring out the turn sequence, but once we did it was lots of fun.

I absolutely loved playing it online at yucata.de... But somehow, playing the actual board game version is not as fun. This is probably the only board game which I enjoy playing online with strangers more than I enjoy playing it on the table with friends. The game is too fiddly, and players always forget to do half of the token-handling that they are supposed to do during their turn. None of the players I've introduced it to wanted to play it again.

It's also not self-contained. The game has been split into a base game and several expansions. Having only the base game available would prove frustrating; but buying several big boxes for what should be a simple board game is extremely annoying, and a waste of both money and shelf space.

Surprisingly good area control game.  It fills a niche different than other area control games in my collection:  (1) it's quick (45 mins); (2) it has a luck element.  Light set of rules, feels like a game that is light/medium in weight and does not overstay its welcome.  The Pied Piper and other expansions increase enjoyment and replayability.  Because the game is quick and light, it's fine to have luck play such a large role, it reduces the desire to AP and increases the surprises.  The theme fits with the game's mechanics.  Highly confrontational (the main mechanism is decreasing the other players' presence on the map) which is a factor to take into account when choosing the group of players who will enjoy it.

Not a particular fan of this game.  And I still have no idea why there are so many expansions/promos for it.  Rats bring the plague.  You try to survive the plague in your area via luck of the draw tokens and manage how many cubes get killed.  You fail at every turn because strategy is nonexistent in the game.  No more tokens?  Kill everybody. Game over.  Thanks for playing.

RATING: 8
This game hits on all levels for me. It's quick, it's got a theme I dig, it's has quality components, the art is nice, it plays in about 30 minutes, setup time is low, it has great expandability with all of the expansions available, it has a relatively small footprint, and it scales well from 2-5. Most importantly, it's fun! 

Update 8/1/2015: 

After two more games with my wife, I have to say that this game is really cool. I had been wanting to get this game to the table for a while, but was never truly excited about the prospect. More or less, I just wanted to see if I still liked it. What I found is that this game is even better than I remembered. It's light, but Rattus is quite different and really enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I consider this one of my 'must have' games.  I bring it with me whenever I take games somewhere.  It's by far my favorite area control game because it plays so quickly.

When I first played Rattus, I thought that the witch was incredibly under powered, and that you'd have to be crazy to pick them.  However, I really recommend people get used to that particular role, because it can be incredibly powerful when combined with the Knight.

EDIT: 12/22/2013: I have now played Rattus close to ten times.  The initial "Oh wow, this is different!" has worn off, but the game remains a very enjoyable and light/quick game.  If you enjoy the game I highly recommend picking up an expansion for it though, as I do not have it yet and it's starting to feel very samey every time.  The expansions have different roles you can substitute to increase the replayability.

I was really looking forward to playing this game. I like the idea of trying to screw your friends by inundating them with plague rats. The components are great and the theme is chaotic and wonderful. However, it was just lacking something for me. So many of the rats don't end up hurting your opponents and placement seems pretty random. While there is definitely some strategy, there isn't enough to make the decisions interesting. The game just didn't balance the chaos, screwiness, and strategy well enough to make it a really engaging experience. However, it plays very quickly and as a filler or with the right group, could be a fun "quickie".

(2017 Q3: Taken away from wishlist)
I just love any game that players put cubes to the map (El Grade-ish, though I well aware this is not a area majority game) so + 0.5 rating. However, it found this game quite boring in two ways: 
1. Most roles seldom being taken by another player because players want to avoid holding to many roles. That means each player repeat their same strategy throughout the whole game.
2. Whenever one player's strategy gains/remains more cubes on the map than the others, all other players will team up to pull this player down.

I just toke a Baker role of the expansion in my last game and it was totally rubbish.

11/01/11 Played a four-player game. I'd call Rattus merely OK. I'd play it again, but hopefully not very often. At least its short. Sure, there was some minimal strategy to it, mainly leader bashing. But for the most part it seemed an exercise in luck, for the "take that" aspect of placing rats in opponent's provinces often did nothing.

RATING: 9
Great tactical game to keep the majority and try to wipe-out the opponents' population, while balancing between using the benefits of the roles and risking more devastating outbreaks in exchange. Some would say it's too random, but that's why there are role combos to mitigate the uncertainty. Plays well with two, best with three or four players.

Game in a Nutshell: Spread your cubes around a map while trying not to get them eaten up by the rats.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: Has an interesting way of making what helps you also hurt you. There's an interesting balance there which shifts as the game progresses. Plays fast. I like the player imposed balance to the game... see someone running away? Time for everyone to gang up on him.

Cons: There's a fair bit of randomness to the game that's done in a way that doesn't add much in the way of excitement. The theme doesn't shine through as much as I'd like so it feels as much like an abstract with workable mechanics than anything else. 

Other: My initial impression is the game could be squeezed in a bit to make things more brutal on the players. Overall, there's some good ideas in the game but just needed to be tightened up a bit to be better.

Best Use: Good light-hearted (if the players can roll with a little spitefulness), medium-time filler.

One thing I like about this game is that it's relatively small and travels easily. Sounds stupid, but it's easy to pick up and toss in a backpack or car. It's also quite a bit of fun and plays fairly quick. It has a very good time to fun ratio. You'll want to pick up the Pied Piper expansion. The core only comes with six role cards, the expansion adds 12 new roles that make the game a lot more fun. Scales great with 2-4 players.

RATING: 8
A nice, well-made, wonderfully compact game that's a breeze to learn and play. The slightly morbid theme feels both appropriate yet suitably glossed over: Rattus would work well as a family game – unless your family is unusually sensitive or squeamish.

The rat markers bring in an element of randomness, but the odds can generally be calculated. While we've yet to come up with anything resembling an overall strategy, the special roles ensure the game is rife with tactical challenges. The black Plague Marker (known variously as Mr. Death, Mr. Plague or Dr. Doom – I really should replace it with a miniature skeleton) moves swiftly across the board, and surgical strikes to populous areas can cause veritable bloodbaths. The end is always tight, however, and in our games, victories have generally been a matter of a single point.

Clever game where everyone is trying to survive the plague in Europe, the color with the most pawns still on the board at game end, wins.

There are special character cards that when taken grant the player an ability.  These character cards remain with the player that used them last, which could mean death for your pawns.  When an outbreak occurs certain pawns die, and sometimes that is figured out by the special character cards people hold.

If you are able to mix clever play with wise character utilization, you will have the most pawns remaining on the board and win the game.

A lightweight area-majority game, with a strong dose of luck: managing this chance element is a significant part of the strategy.

Negatives:
The game does nothing to make AP [b]more[/b] likely - but players who take a long time will find plenty of reasons to do so.
There is a dose of luck when "rat" chips are distributed. This can be managed, but not entirely.

Positives:
Quick to teach, with simple and accessible rules. I rank it with [i]China[/i] in that respect. Play is reasonably quick unless players are individually slow.
The components are top quality - the board and "character" boards are [i]beautiful[/i], printed on high quality stock. The rules are well presented, and even the box has linen finish. Very impressed!

An excellent 2-player game with an excellent theme. We play this mostly as a 2player game...it needs more plays with more players. The components and artwork are perfect for this tiny little game. I love the mechanics in their simplicity and game integration...simply perfect. This is a wonderful week night game, quick to set up, easy to remember the rules and you could play another game after finishing the first...back to back.

It's fun, but not something I need to own.  I think the roles are clever, and I know we haven't explored the depth since no one used the witch or the monk in 2 games.  It seems like there is a limit to how much difference your moves make, and then which tokens you happen to get determine the winner.

RATING: 4.5
[b]Rattus [/b]is a simple, light 45 min game about the plague (incidentally it could be re-themed to be about zombies).

It's highly tactical - you can't make any long term plans. You place cubes on the board representing population, but they get swept off so quickly that it's hard to plan even 1 turn in advance. The goal is to have the most pop. in play when the game ends. 

This was with only 2 other players - the expansions take it up to 6p, but I imagine that would be far too chaotic. I worry that because it is so interactive that it may devolve into a game where you win by being attacked the least, rather than by anything in particular that you did well.

I liked that there are special power cards (huge tiles), the more you have the more abilities you have, but each card makes you more vulnerable to having your cubes killed (they have icons which are triggered when chits with matching icons are turned over, killing your dudes).

I also liked that you can place cubes equal to the threat level in a region - so safe regions are less potent, but will probably survive longer.

There's a region on the board (the Castle) that is apart from the map (think the Castillo in El Grande). If you put cubes there, they are safe until the end of the game. I like to think of it as the government bunker. :zombie:

RATING: 7
A little brain burner that's quick to play for the evenings when we don't have 3+ hrs time.

I like this with any number of players, but I'm not quite sure with how many players I like this the best. With two players the game is a lot less chaotic and you have much more control over what's happening on the board, but as there are less cubes, the plague also does less damage. With four there simply happens too much between your turns. Plague ravages all over the map and you have to find the optimal positions keeping the player order in mind. So you have to use different strategies compared to just two players and maybe push your luck a bit more.

Seems light but can be quite a brain burner, beautiful and quick to play. In general I prefer longer and heavier games, but this is great on the right occasions.

A try-and-stay-alive type of game, trying to accumulate powers that will work together to keep your guys on the board, and hoping that other players will leave you alone to allow combos to work. Well, that's not going to happen, so the game provides a see-sawing affair with powers moving around. Each turn a region is chosen by the player to suffer the plague, which won't be a region he's in, and then flip the plague tokens. These create an interesting dynamic - it feels good to put lots of cubes out (which you can only do in highly infested areas) but the more cubes in a region, the more likely they are to die. Or you can put a single cube out in a low-infestation region where it's much more likely to survive. Meaning there's choices and differing approaches to explore, which makes it interesting enough to keep for a while.

Well produced game, nice thick role cards, since they're handled a lot are advantageous.

Need to adjust style of play to player count.  With only 2p, there won't be near as many plague outbreaks as when there are 4p.  Consequently, it isn't quite as dangerous to have character cards.  Jockeying for good combos with those becomes an interesting twist in a 2p game.

You want to place all your cubes onto the board, however each turn, the active player triggers the plague in one area and the more cubes you have there the more likely you are to have some removed and placed back into your general supply. A simply game with very few rules and a few special powers. If you are in the lead, you will be the target, however not having any of the special powers will lower your chances of having cubes removed.

RATING: 5
An ok area control game.  The roles are cool but the method of taking them is a bit odd.  What really did this game in for me, though, was that the turns are too fiddly for a game of this weight. You place cubes, move the plaque marker, spread rat tokens, check to see if the threshold for flipping rat tokens in any regions is met, and then possibly flip rat tokens and read icons to see who is affected based on who has which roles.  That is entirely too much for a light game.  I sold this and got Eight Minute Empire: Legends, which is a similar game but with much smoother gameplay.

Un bel gioco semplice, da proporre come gateway, con semplici regole, durata contenuta e un'ottima grafica.
E' un gioco di ispirazione tedesca con un'altissima interazione distruttiva tra i giocatori: mai proliferare da soli in una regione, sarai il bersaglio degli untori  avversari; meglio essere un po' dappertutto, possibilmente in minoranza.
Ad aggiungere pepe al gioco, i personaggi che si bilanciano da soli: si hanno più poteri speciali, ma si aumenta la probabilità di essere spazzati via dalla peste quando essa si manifesta.
Un gioco delizioso che, grazie alla disponibilità di nuovi personaggi, è espandibile all'infinito.

This is a fast-playing game where you're trying to get your cubes on the board in such a way that they don't get subsequently removed.  There are a number of special ability placards that you can claim, but each of these makes it easier for your cubes to go away.  So there's somewhat of a tradeoff between being able to do more and being less likely to be hurt.  I found it difficult to come up with a cogent strategy in this game, and at the end, the scores were close enough that there might not be one.  Hmm.

Neat Euro with very few rules to be concerned about, which makes it great in my book. The theme is a bit dark, but nothing worse than war type games or combat games.
I really like the fact that it takes little time to explain the rules of the game and it plays very quickly. The only possible drawbacks are that it may lend itself for the perfectionist types to just think the whole moves through dragging the game down, and the fact that it is a cutthroat direct confrontation game (at least if you want to win).

Shame about the scarcity of the expansions, though.  I'm usually not a complete-ist (well, alright, I kind of am), but I dislike seeing gouged prices on stuff that I was two years late to the party on.  Particularly when they're still available in Europe.

Played twice so far. In the first game, we fought over the King but ended up using every character except the Witch. We didn't really know what we were doing and I ended up ending the game by getting all of my cubes on the board. Once the plague was played out, it was pretty close but also felt too random.

We played again a couple weeks later and this time my wife used the Knight and Merchant to great effect. She would put three cubes down and then push them onto a neighboring spot with fewer rats (which was building up a large population). Then she used the Knight to push the plague marker far enough away that the only way I could get it back to her was to take the Knight from her. Having only one character at that point, even if I got the plague back to her people, she wasn't getting hit very hard. She ended up winning by a good margin.

After the game, we thought of a lot of great ways to stop that strategy from working. It turned out the way I was trying to attack her was in fact enabling her to stay in the corner. I should have been using my Monk to take rat tokens AWAY from her area, forcing her to spread her population. If she couldn't put three cubes down in a single region, she'd have a harder time using the merchant power. Now we badly want to try the game again!

I picked up the Witch and Monk and tried keeping better plague tokens to myself. I liked the Witch and will probably use her in future games, although I feel like she needs a TINY bit more power. Perhaps she could have the ability to look at all rat tokens in a single region and then rearrange them or have the ability to look at and swap two rat tokens at the time the plague is being resolved. It would be fun if people felt the Witch was worth fighting for.

After two plays, starting this at a 7.

Played twice as of 9/22/10.  Initial thoughts are that the game seems to be "missing something".

First, the things I like about Rattus.  It plays quickly and the rules are easy to understand.  I find the theme to fit well with the game's mechanics which is always a plus with me.  Despite the fact that the cubes are a little "plain jane", they are functional and easy to pick up and move around.  The role cards are nice and sturdy.

There are a few things I am still trying to wrap my head around, however.  I am amazed how many times the rats have "no effect" when they go off.  Maybe its just poor play by myself considering I am still learning the game - but that is my first impression.  Also, the roles really vary in their power level.  Its not *that* important because you can always take any role you wish during your turn, but I found myself reluctant to take a role such as the witch because I felt I exposed myself to more harm from the plague for not as much benefit in return.  Again, this may be my inexperience in the game but after 2 plays, it certainly feels this way.

I think this game may benefit a lot from its upcoming expansion.  It has the opportunity to add a bit more variety which I feel the game needs.

Bottom line, Rattus is a game that, while I wouldn't mind owning, will be pushed down the list for other games.  My friend who bought Rattus enjoys it a lot and is planning on picking up the Pied Piper expansion soon - so I am looking forward to seeing what it does to game play.  In the meantime, I will still play Rattus but it hasn't grabbed me in the way I had hoped.

Plays very quickly. Area control and role selection. The gist is that players are placing population markers on a map of Europe and moving a pawn representing the black plague, which can decimate populations and spread to neighboring regions. Each role provides benefits but also increase the likelihood that a player will lose more population markers when the plague strikes. Hopefully the tension will be higher with 3+.

Add your peasants to the board, move the plague bearer, try not to die of the black death. This is a simple strategy game in which the victory goes to the player who is able to get the largest number of their 20 peasants into Europe without them dying. I've only played five player and it should be said that it felt quite random and a bit too long at that number of players but looked like it would play better with 4.

An interesting little anti-area control game.  I enjoyed my play of this and would play it again.  The two main dynamics, population and character selection are neat and I like the balance you have to stike with using the characters for their abilities, yet not having so many characters that the plague will wipe you out.

In the end, this game really comes in at a comfortable play time, but needs either better art or some random event element for my tastes.  Still not a game I would turn down.

I liked this game very much. It's incredibly quick and strategic enough that it's not just a throwaway filler. You have to think in this one. The role selection is a big part of it. Do you take a lot of roles to get more powers, or keep as few as possible to have a better chance of staying on the board? There's a bit of randomness in it, but it's okay in a game this short.

Positively surprised! This is a good game with a short duration that is explained in a couple of minutes. Nice combination of area control, role picking and moving the evil. The theme is actually there. I wonder how it's played with the expansions. Want to play it again.

Played for the first time last night and I had a blast ! My friend has all 52 character cards so we used some pretty cool stuff.. and those abilities were all over the place.. it was awesome. I love the balance btween having more characters and therefore being able to get rid of your cubes quicker but suffering the consequence of also being killed off quicker when you activate the plague... it's brilliant. This game exceeded my expectations and I am eager to play it again.

I dont need to own it, although I'd play it again. My taste has shifted into new territories so I lowered my rating.

Fun enough, but there's a lot of randomness that detracts from the game (and, notwithstanding the one role's ability to look under the chips, not much there to mitigate the randomness).  It might improve with the expanded roles.

Интересна игра, която е доста забавна, въпреки че е свързана с най-мрачният период в Европа - Появата на Черната смърт, заради която половината население изчезва.
Интересна механика с избор на характери допринася допълнително разнообразие в играта, а синергията между тях позволява интересни силни комбинации, с които да се пробвате да спечелите играта.

It's a fairly quick journey around Europe, stopping off and wiping the odd cube off the board. Honestly... we expected more death. The mechanism is a spin on the pick a role and enact the power, except here picking a role increases your chance of losing cubes when an area containing your cubes is resolved. Additionally, you might get stuck with a role you don't want, so choose wisely.

All in all it's a rather chaotic game with four. Short. Easy rules. A mechanism that should keep everyone very close in the scoring.

RATING: 6
Themed abstract in which your objective is to get rid of most of your cubs. On their turn players can lay some of their cubs, and then move the pest trying to get their rivals' ones back to their hands. They also can perform some special actions to improve their chances. Well thought and solid game, just not my cup of tea because it is at the end a real abstract brain burner.

RATING: 8
This is a nice, clever little game. The rules are easy to understand and the game is short enough, but everything (roles and infection mechanic) works very well. Luck is largely involved, but chaos remains within reasonable limits. I only wish the production was of better taste in general (although I have no problem with the role cards that are big, thick and pretty): Rattus would have been a great addition to the Abacus thin box series, for example (China, Emerald, Hansa...)

The idea of having a light game is to have strong interaction. And this is not really it. Yes, it's direct conflict, but at this level of fluffy I want some real interaction: talking, doublethinking, something. It's just tit for tat. The idea of making such games as this one (area control, action optimisation) is to give you something to think and decide and this one doesn't so it's gets lost in the sea of very good light games with actual interaction. 

I'll play it. Or not. Not much difference. Maybe I need to play this with kids. 

EDIT: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - I just cannot phantom a reason that justifies this game's existence. It's too light to be a gamers' game, it's too dull with too little interaction for casual players. (Yes it has interaction, but for this weight, there are many more interactive games out there). 
[hr]A poster child for games that have no excuse for existing. Too light for an area control to provide a challenge. Too boring and mechanic-ey for a light game in the vast rainforest of dynamic, exciting and interactive light games. It's game hobby gamers thing non-gamers want. But there are many great non-hobby games out there.

Az előzetes BGG-n olvasott vélemények alapján gyenge játékra számítottam és a társas nem is cáfolt ezekre rá. Tényleg gyenge. A játékosok kockákat raknak le Európa térképére és megpróbálják átvészelni, hogy a pestis elvigye őket. A játék egyetlen érdekes mechanizmusa a szerepek választása. Bárkitől el lehet venni és addig nálad marad, míg más el nem veszi. Minél több szereped van, annál több eséllyel hullik el kockád. A szerepek jók, de véleményem szerint kiegyenlítetlenek. Van szinte használhatatlan és van túl erős köztük. A patkánylapok, amik a kockák levételének metódusát adják óriási szerencsét visznek a játékba. A királycsinálás magas szinten jelenik meg, mert a pestis terjedését a játékosok határozzák meg. Szóval káosz a köbön, sok szerencsével és királycsinálással. Erénye a játéknak a rövidsége, a könnyű szabálymagyarázata és a bárki által játszhatósága, de ez nagyon kevés így. Nem tetszett.

[2018-01-06]
Második játékra jóval jobb élmény volt. A királycsinálást már kevésbé éreztem erősnek, de a patkánylapok továbbra is óriási szerencsefaktort adnak a játéknak. A szerepekről a véleményemet továbbra is tartom, sőt most 3 kiegészítős szerep mellett is jelentkezett, hogy voltak, amik használatba se kerültek. A korábban felsorolt játék erények azért sokat jelentenek, hisz a játék fél óra, ami esetén a szerencse tolerálható. Továbbra se lesz kedvenc, de azért mindenképp emelek a ponton. 3 -> 5

Decent area control game. Certainly there is incentive to spread out, or otherwise the rats will get you.

It's hard to say what's wrong with Rattus except that there's nothing to love about it. Theoretically there's a theme, but the mechanics abstract away from it. The mechanics impart some tactical control, but there's a good bit of randomness, draining away the strategy. And if I were looking for an entry-level area control game, I wouldn't choose this one. But it's not bad.

There's not much to say about this game: It doesn't have anything new. Decisions are almost the same every turn. Theme is very uninteresting. Luck decides a great deal.

I won't be playing it more because I've already played it and didn't like it. Too much randomness and decisions made by a rat token. This is even more obvious in two player games because if one has luck against the other, the difference between players becomes even bigger. A minus five cubes directly represent a plus five cubes to the opponent.

The theme is great but something is missing to make this really fun and I am not sure what that is. The luck factor with the rat coins is there but especially with the witch card manageable, I like the character cards and the mechanic where you can lose them when someone else takes them in the beginning of their turn (but only then) yet how they are linked to the raging plague. Still, something doesn't quite grab, maybe I need to try the expansion? Many people here claim it is essential to the game..
Lowered my rating another half point, I played a couple of online plays now and think it is luck based in a way I don't appreciate. The theme is still fun but since the games seem to score rather close the final outcome is a pure whim of what rat coin is in your area in the end. Plus, it seems that if players don't choose to take any cards they seem to do just as bad/ good as those who take cards....

I'm normally not a big fan of games with an important 'take that'-factor, but Rattus does it in the right way. The game is still fairly chaotic, the characters are not very balanced, but the game is short and compelling enough to be interesting. After a few games, you would probably need the expanbsion to keep it from getting stale, though.

RATING: 8
Rattus is easy to teach, plays quickly, and comes in a small box, but there's a surprising amount of play in this modest little game. I love a game that allows lots of tactical shenanigans with a simple rule set, and this fills the bill.

If you enjoy Rattus, consider picking up the Pied Piper expansion, which triples the number of personalities available. Using different personalities really changes the feel, and should keep the game fresh indefinitely.

Just looking at Rattus I would never have bought it, but favorable comments by my GeekBuddies led me to give it a try. They were right, as ususal. I'm glad I listened.

I'm hoping that my rating will improve over time as I'm still getting over my initial feelings about this not quite being the game that I'd hoped for. My gripe is that nobody really gets killed by the plague, you just have a few cubes returned to you. I'd rather start with more cubes, and see them sacrificed in a Downfall Of Pompeii' style, but then maybe that is just me!

With more plays, I'm not really any more satisfied with this, and I'm also slightly frustrated that every time I play this online, the winning strategy seems to be take no cards. So a whole area of the game isn't balanced. Great.

Egyelôre fogalmam sincs mi a jó taktika. Az tûnik a legbiztosabbnak, ha mindig a Királyt választom és egy kockát minden lépésben menekítek a kastélyba. Nagy káosz a játék, hiába szeretnék bizonyos tartományokban kockát menteni, megtartani, egyszerûen lehetetlen, hiszen minél több a kocka annál valószínûbb, hogy kitör a járvány és vehetem le a kockáimat. És persze az ellenfelek se hagyják, hogy túl sok kockám legyen egy-egy helyen. Lehet, több játék után már lenne valami startégia, aminek látom értelmét, de most úgy érzem, hogy a játék elején tök mindegy mit csinálok és hova teszem a kockáimat.

I don't know what tactic is good in this game.  I guess selecting the king is a good choice, because I save one cube in every round.

A fairly quick two player game. I definitely enjoyed it and will want to play it more frequently.  I played the 2P version and would like to see how it works with more people spreading out the cards.  Own Pied Piper too, so will try that soon. UPDATE: I'd like to play this more frequently, but it always gets bypassed by other players. UPDATE: As much as I want to like this game, the strategy of one player putting every one of their cubes into Spain and pushing the plague away with the knight card is just infuriating.  It seems to break the game to me.  I have the game, the Joker expansion, the Pied Piper expansion, and the Africanus one too, but I won't sit there and watch someone just put their cubes into the same place every time and push the plague away and win every time like that.  This game seems broken to me.

The theme is wonderful, and flipping the tiles to discover the extent of the destruction wrought by the rats is pretty amusing. I'm not sure Rattus has much upside in terms of depth or replayability, but it'll certainly be an entertaining diversion now and again.

The Pied Piper expansion is critical to the game's replayability. It is amazing how different each game can play based on the characters available, but no game plays the same. Fairly high dosage of luck involved, but appropriate for the duration of the game (20-40 minutes).

I'm not sure how much legs this one has.  The 3 player game did not feel better than the 2 player.  Only now I had to worry about "picking" on one opponent over another.  I still managed to get almost all of my cubes out before the rats ran out.  Good with 3, great with 2, so far.

Liked this game much better than I was expecting. The quick play time is a real strength, as this game would be too long otherwise.

Still, luck seems to be able to really dictate the game, at least in my one play. One player kept being unaffected by rats because even though she had a majority in several areas, very few of the "majority" rat tokens turned up in her areas.

I love this game! 

First of all, the theme is quaint and the game actually does feel well-enough connected with that. I love history and I love the topic of diseases and epidemiology, so that was an instant draw. The art and components are also very nice. High quality--wooden cubes with thick counters and artwork that is both a little cute, but very grown up.

And I also find it to be a good game. It's light and easy to learn, but all the character cards and combinations make for so many options and things to try. Limiting the amount of population growth in an area to the number of rat tokens (and therefore risk) also makes things interesting. As does linking the potential severity of impact of each rat token on a given player to not only the total amount of population (makes sense), but to the relative population between the players in that area and also the character cards. Such simple ideas, really, but they all mean that every gain comes with added risk somewhere, somehow, and the game comes down to trying to manage and manipulate those risks in your favor. 

I've heard people say this game "has no strategy". Whhhhaaaa? There are SO MANY strategies? Do you try to move the plague towards other players to hurt them (maybe take the Knight for that, maybe throw in the Monk to move rats their way, too)? Or do you try moving your own pieces to safety in the castle (King) or just moving your pieces away from wherever the plague is? You can focus on growing lots of population (Peasant, anyone?) or keeping population moderate, but in less danger from the plague. Lots of ideas there. 

It also depends on your opponents. Will that other player take it personally if you hit them with the plague and decide to make the rest of the game a vendetta against YOU? Will they play aggressively with the plague or defensively or a mix of both? Will they try and snatch up as many characters and abilities as they can (oooooh, shiny!) or will they be more spartan and try to play with no characters at all hoping to minimize any potential plague hits they will incur? 

No strategy? I guess there are just so many possibilities that it makes the game feel like the board game equivalent of "button mashing".

For me, this is one of the few interesting strategy games I could imagine myself trying to bring to the table for a family gathering and getting my older and younger relatives alike to try.

A cute game of trying to keep your cubes alive through the ravages of the black plague. Interesting choices in where the plague triggers and a neat mechanic where cards giving special powers cause you to be more vulnerable to the plague as long as you hold them (but any players can steal one on any of their turns). Light group filler, plays okay with 2 as well.

First Impression:

Too random for my taste, though somewhat fun. Some interesting mechanics and a dark theme taken lightly make for an interesting experience. 

Most choices are obvious and can be scripted. Even then the results are pretty random, and the game normalises this by allowing players to repeatedly bash whoever leads. The end leader is therefore still random. 

This is not a gateway game (strange theme + aggressive gameplay, nor a filler (it's played in 1/2h+), nor a euro (luck), nor a thematic game... Oh well, at least it flows well and has some takethat moments.

Europe, 1347. A disaster is about to strike. The Black Death reaches Europe, and during the next 4-5 years, the population of Europe will be halved.
The players settle in the various regions of Europe, while the plague spreads throughout all of the continent. The players gain help from the various classes of the middle ages: The Peasants provide population growth, the wise Monks keep the rats away, the rich Merchants flee when the plague approaches, the warfare conducted by the Knights spreads the plague to new areas, the Witches controls the spread through magic and witchcraft, whereas the Kings avoid the plague by staying in their fortified palaces. But the plague does not make any distinction: When the rats arrive, no one can feel safe. 
When the plague withdraws and the game ends, the player with the highest surviving population wins.

Spread the plague to your friends and family.  Rattus takes you on an adventure, instigating mass annihilation in medieval Europe before zombies and pandemics made it cool for the general population.  This game is a favorite, especially with the addition of the Pied Piper Expansion.

RATING: 4.5
In this game, the only meaningful decision you'll make each turn is whether or not to take a new role card. The rest of the gameplay feels chaotic, random and futile. It is impossible to keep your cubes safe for more than a single turn, so after your turn you feel completely at the mercy of other players and the randomly placed rat counters. A very bland and shallow game in my opinion.

Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I was hoping for a two player variation of China.  Not even close.  The chaos of the early game - put cubes on, take them off - continues until the end when it feels like only the choices made when the end is in sight make any really difference.

Yes, there are some basic strategies.  Using the king in combo with other roles can quickly get you cubes in the protected kingdom, but this can be easily stopped.

There are some players who can actually win this game without ever taking a role card.  That this can ever result in a win makes me shake my head.  Have no idea why this game is so popular.

Very early rating, 2p game. Interesting game, short (which is a plus) and funny with 2 players. I expect the 3 (probably 4 too) player to be the better game though. Not yet sure of how much it'll replay, so rating could evolve. The amount of luck was not really an issue (there is of course luck in the rat tokens, but I feel that it is really manageable). Looking for another game or 2 before making my mind.

RATING: N/A
Only played a portion of the game while in a lineup at bgg.con, but I played enough to form an opinion. Simple area majority game, where you try and get as many of your cubes on the board as you can, and keep them there, while the rats and plague remove them. Special powers helps you get your cubes down or move them around, but also makes it more likely yours get removed. I think having the expansion with completely different powers in each game would really help this one stop feeling same-y after a while.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Based on one play of the base game at London on Board (July 2012) I LOVE this game. It feels like El Grande, which I love for its area control element and full-on player interaction. However, it's playable by two and has the added tension of lucky token flipping. It's also short, attractive and has an unusual (albeit macabre) theme.

Like El Grande, you try to get and keep cubes on the board. There's a castle off the main board and a big meeple players move around the map to scupper their opponents' plans.

Unlike El Grande where the only hidden information is the castille, you're constantly biting your lip as plague tokens are flipped up each turn. The plague tokens remove your cubes from the board and add the tense luck component beloved of the best Ameritrash games.

And instead of random and changing role cards, you can take a role each turn a la Citadels or Carson City. But, watch out, the more roles you have, the more likely your settler cubes will be to get 'plagued'.

Scoring is also dead easy - just count up how many cubes are on the board. Much easier than El Grande.

If you're a master strategist, hate luck, and play games very very seriously, I can imagine you'd hate Rattus though.

e played 'Rattus' first off where players are trying to sustain their European population in the face of the Black Death (another film where Sean Bean's character dies!) Oops, spoiler alert! The mechanics are fairly straightforward as you can place more population in infected areas, and those with greater rat numbers attract lower rents, so doing so is a risk. The winning player is the one with the largest surviving population. You can also select notables, in the form of character cards, that give additional benefits although these can be taken back by other players on their turn. Certain cards are better than others but all have their uses. Rat tokens are turned over at the end of each player's turn, once the Black Death marker has been moved, and these identify which if any population dies. A grim theme but fun inflicting the plaque on someone else! Twisted? You bet.

This one fell flat for me. Area majority with plenty of take that. The rulebook is horrible. The theme is non-existent. It's really an abstract game. It plays incredibly fast which can be a good thing. There is a lot of luck involved with the secret rat tiles. Just not my cup of tea.

This is a little -- no, a [i]lot[/i] -- more clever than I was expecting it to be.  I had initially written this game off as not being for me, since the rules suggested that there was a lot of take that going on, as well as an area control aspect to it, but it's really just a game of tactics where you're trying to make the best of your situation every turn, and in fact, I would go so far as to call this an [i]anti[/i]-area control game.  There's some risk taking involved with the rat tiles, but you can manage it to some degree by not getting too many of your own people in one region before sending the plague marker in that direction.  I like the balancing mechanism of being able to add more people to a region based on the rat tiles, but also being more at risk of losing people to the plague because of the rat tiles.  This game is like a small, condensed wargame, and I find it to be oddly charming.  That it plays in such a short amount of time probably contributes to that charm.

Rattus is a medium-strategy game which handles in the Dark Ages during the black plague. The players try to hold the disease.
To do this they get help from farmers, magicians, knights, nobles, ... But nothing helps as long as the rats keep coming.

The outcomes feel a little random to me (I swear it's not because I haven't won!), but I really love this little game.  Simple, fast, and interesting.  The game really shines when you start adding extra characters, since these can change the game drastically and there are just so many combinations to explore.

Normally I'm not a promo whiner, but this is one case where I think they should *really* consider re-releasing the 2010 promos as a regularly available mini-expansion.  All the different characters are what makes this game for me, and after playing my friend's copy, the game would feel very incomplete without Dracula and Robin Hood in the mix.  That's enough to prevent me from buying my own copy until I know I can get ahold of them.

I wanted to like this game but it falls really flat for me.  Sure I have only played this once, but I can't see myself ever playing it again.  Just not the right fit for me I guess.  I am really starting to thin my collection to games that I really like and am wondering if I would have ever liked this game.  This game reminds me of how I felt about clans -- I just did not find it fun.  So no matter how attractive the game is, and how well the mechanics work, if it is not fun, why play it?

I just couldn't believe this game was a 5.5 so I played it again and it improved.  I played it again and it improved again.  It is by no means a gem, but is alright.  I think it is more like a 6.5 now.  I need to try it with 4 players to see how it plays.  The nice thing about it is it takes like 25 minutes to play so I can try it a few times.

Put cubes onto a map of Europe and hope the plague doesn't ravage them. Most cubes on the board wins once all the rat tokens have been used up. Character cards can be used for their bonus powers; you can accrue them and they sit in front of you, but each one you have increases the odds that you'll be affected by plague. I like how that works - there are interesting decisions to be made over whether to take another character and which ones would help best at the time. Some were clearly better than others, though, and I don't know whether the rat tiles reflect that by featuring the better characters' symbols more often.

Interesting and fast game of constant calculation of your possible loss and win of population. Scores often are very close. Though it feels a bit repetitive, but probably Expansion will add more to it to even score higher.

UPD: after playing dozens of games, even with expansions, it actually drops. It is getting too frustrating. You have a strategy and use cards wisely, and yet too many times you lose because of bad luck of plague tokens draw. Too often players can win without ever using any card, which denies whole gameplay and expansion value.

a little silly area control type game, but it plays quickly.  the role selection is a little wonky, and it seems that you are encouraged to pick the worser roles, so that you can keep more of them.  once you end up with two or three roles, you have an immediate and viable advantage.  ending up with no roles, really hurts, especially in the en game.  it's short though, so maybe that doesn't matter much.

Get all your cubes on the board!  Oh, did I mention that the plagued rats like to infest highly populated regions?  Yeah, that'll undo your efforts.  The game usually ends due to all the rats being in play, and then the plague sweeps the whole map.  Strangely, this is pretty fun.

After 2+ Plays: The balance of reward and penalties for taking roles is interesting.  A bit too chaotic to be a favorite, but not bad.

Well, Rattus is certainly an interesting game. A plague themed boardgame? I was pleased by the various abilities provided by the different occupations, and with 4 players they are particularly noticeable. I did not feel that there was much control over your fate, however. The entire game is a rollercoaster of "cubes on, cubes off", and that seeming randomness is not what I look for in a game.

An interactive Euro with a healthy dash of luck and some fun character powers, both of which keep the game from being yet another dry, gear-grinding activity. Plus the game plays in about 40 minutes, and that's just right.

The expansion is recommended when the game starts to get stale, but it is a bit on the pricey side.

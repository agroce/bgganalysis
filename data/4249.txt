Sencillo de puteo para jugar de 3-5 y mejor a 4 jugadores. Tematica dinosaurios, bastante pegada.  Juego de mayorías en el que te tienes que separar o "fabricar" tus propias zonas de puntuación (grandes) mientras aislas en las pequeñas a los rivales, esto se muestra deshaciendo una agrupación inicial de hexágonos que representan Pangea al fin del Triásico, con un hexágono central que no se mueve y sera el polo sur, y dependiendo del terreno podrán haber 2, 3 o 4 mepleesaurios xD. Y por supuesto mínimo 2 para poder procrear xD

RATING: 3
Judging by its theme and setting Trias could be a fun game - dinosaurs trying to survive on drifting continents. But it is not. Playing and scoring mechanisms are rather abstract and thus not very intuitive considering the theme. Your turn consists of drifting a tile and moving your sauruses into better position so that they can hop onto the new continents at the very moment when they are disconnected with the main land. Game ends suddenly and too soon leaving very little room for real dramatic arc to develop (not that I would have wanted to play any longer). In principle there are no major flaws except for one, the game is not fun to play.

Deeper than it looks, but marred by poor art.

[i]Trias[/i] is strange in that it looks like a lightweight, but it isn't. Indeed, it may be too deep for its own good, as I could play something else that looks better, is about as demanding, and lasts just as long.

I'd be willing to play it again, but I really don't need my own copy.

Board movement to simulate continental drift is unique and creative.  Plays longer than expected and better with more players.  provides ample strategy opportunities and rewards players for good planning.  The board movement can feel a bit fiddly, but also adds a temporal pacing as the game spreads out to a close.  Great little game that should be recommended more often.  Great little dino meeples too!  [GTI Code: TPSD]

I just don't get it... yet.  I am trying to, I really am, but after a couple plays I am still confused and looking for more.   With the help of some very nice people (sodaklady) I am honing up my gameplay knowledge and look forward to further encounters with my doomed dinos.   A low rating for now as I really don't get it...

Update:  So now I get it.  After rereading the rules and having some discussions it makes sense to me.  Problem.  My buddies don't want to play.  They didn't enjoy the first couple of games and don't have anything invested in it, unlike the money I put into it.  I'm just waiting for another couple to come over for some games so I can give this another try.

Excellent little area-majority game, although the drifting rules can be difficult to explain to new players, as well a trifle hard to see if one position is further away from the Pole than another.

Some unique and interesting mechanics that actually fit the theme rather well. Still an abstract at heart but a fun one. Much more deep than would seem after the first impression.

Seems like a decent filler. Some of the mechanics are a little odd and seem to require studying them before introducing the game to a crowd of Trias newbies.  I liked the overall mechanic of moving dinos and the land masses.

After a few plays, I see there is quite of bit of fun to have here...it plays quickly, and if you have the means to print out the grid aid here on the Geek, drifting becomes trivial to both explain and perform. 

One complaint: if you don't watch out, you're bound to get swept away on your own little "drifter", which eliminates any player interaction with you - definitely a bit "huh?" when it happens.

More abstract than I like, but it's a pretty good game.  There's a lot of chaos... especially in a 5-player game.  To do well, you need to get creative with your moves (especially the drifts), and the "extra drift" action becomes very important in the mid-game (when most of your dinos are out on the "board").  A hex-map with numbers showing the distance from the center space would make the drifts easier.

I'm a park ranger by profession, geologist by training. Therefore, a game with dinosaur meeples (dinomeeples?) was a must have. The dino-meeples are awesome! I picked this up in a trade and will keep it, but as expected, the gameplay and theme are lacking. When you move continent tiles, the dinosaurs fall into the water and then can swim to a new tile or drown? It makes no sense! Why not stay on the island? This is still what I think, but after another 2-player play, I enjoyed it much more. It's silly, but fun. Gameplay is mostly straight forward, and I like how the new continents evolve. I also thought the 2-player game was not very exciting, and was waiting to player 2 dino-meeple colors with Erin, but this play made me think there was more to the 2-player game. Will definitely continue to evaluate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Reminiscent of Tongiaki, in appearance, style of play and ability to manipulate the other players' pieces - and also for having rule mechanics which really do capture the theme very well; in Tongiaki's case, it's Polynesian voyagers and, in this one, it's the extinction of dinosaurs and the breaking-up of the continent of Pangea.  The tactics are subtler than Tongiaki but the opportunities to recover from a serious bit of screwage are far fewer.  I suspect I'll be playing this a lot and that my rating will go up with each play, as I begin to understand its deeper subtleties.

A very interesting game with a hell of a lot going on, I felt that the game lasted too long - in the future I think we'll play by cutting some of each type of card from the 1 deck.  The end of teh game was spent doing bugger all because all our actions that could be performed had been.  We were just waiting on that meteor!

With the changes to the game length this game would be quite enjoyable! - it's a 7 with those changes, a 6 without.

After the first half-dozen or so plays, this has been pretty impressive. It's fairly abstract and a bit dry, but is very unique and the play is interesting; it's a pretty standard compete-for-areas game, but how those areas come about, splitting and merging and migrating, is a very neat process. This has turned out to have a lot more longevity than I first expected, in large part just due to how each game develop in interesting and different ways.

RATING: 4
This is a unique little area majority tile laying game. I’m usually a fan of these mechanics, but in this game I think the game is less than the sum of its parts. It lacks that “something” which makes a game grab my attention, and I was not intrigued by the simple gameplay; you play a terrain card (3 different terrain types), move that tile and then have 4 action points which you can spend on a couple of things, as in Tikal, which is also a game I’m not really fond of. 
It is actually a quite simple game to play as the actions themselves are straightforward, but there are lots of little rules you need to remember, and as the game progresses it becomes harder to see if a play is legal (as you must move a tile further away from the center piece – and why did they not include a mat or something that you could place the hexagons on? It could really use one). The rules can be slightly confusing.

It is a very mean game in which you are constantly removing tiles from under other players’ dinosaurs (although you must be present on that continent to do so, so you cannot just wildly attack and hurt the other players). In my couple of plays we all played in a mean way, and that’s how I think the game should be played – and is almost the only way to do so if you want to win.
Speaking of winning, I hated how important the last couple of turns are! You can make a huge mess and split a continent or connect one, and this can have a huge impact on the game, as, when the meteor card is drawn, you cannot move any tiles, so you’re stuck with how the world is shaped at that time… And that's a huge bummer and why my rating is so low.

With the dino meeples in the US edition I feel this is not an abstract game at all because you can get into what's happening. 

Not as fun with 2 as it is with 3 or 4. While it isn't necessary, I do wish it came with a hex grid and I may just have to get/make one for when I play. 

Provocative little game.

The game play is good and very strategic. Plan out your actions ahead of time and react to whatever your opponents do. The game was a bit to dry for me, I would probably play it down the road on occasions, but nothing I would suggest.

RATING: 7
I made myself a special mat to go with the game that really facilitates tile movement and prevents them from all moving when you take or place one.  

It is made of blue felt, about 3'x3', and is marked for each zone (I used Sharpies of different colors).  Hexagon frames network with a number inside each, and color based on which zone (1, 2, 3...).

It REALLY makes the game easier to play and more fun.  No need to calculate zones as it's now an instant check with a quick glance.

The continental drift is a fresh and exciting twist on the area majority mechanic.  If you enjoy area influence games and games where you can plan out some really fun moves, then Trias is a must try.  We played a 3 player game and I would also recommend that number of players.

Very original mechanic, with the drifting tiles ... Only played once, but seems to suffer a bit from analysis paralysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite each player having only 4 action points per turn, a decent amount of analysis paralysis can occur in this game, especially when choosing which tile to drift.  One minor annoyance is that players don't have very many choices near the end of the game, since continents have separated (fewer movement & drift choices).  In general, the game is relatively fun and requires managing dinosaur breeding, movement, and the balance between scoring early on small islands vs. scoring big on large continents at the end.

Doris artwork is always a plus.

We bought this and only ever played it 2-player.  We liked the theme, somewhat reminiscent of Survive.  The game seemed to have potential, but wasn't overly exciting to play.  As the land breaks up, you already know who will be able to score for each new bit of land.  So a mistake early in the game can be impossible to recover from.  We thought it would probably be better with more players, but decided to trade this away.  Later I did get a chance to try this with 4 players and found it really long and slow.  We don't regret a bit that we got rid of this one.

A dynamic territorial game with novel mechanic for continental drift. A really great little game with lots of decisions and a minimum of luck, but still feels light and fun. Improved by adding a hex grid to make it much easier to determine where you can move the tiles. A+ for theme and mechanics meshing well.

A good game, there is strategic long term planning required as well as opportunity for tactical brilliance. This is always a plus. I did poorly in my two games but I still think its very good.

RATING: 6
Tile laying area control game.  Unlike Carcassonne or Gheos, the hex tiles (3 types) are placed into a single larger hex pattern prior to play.  Play begins after players make initial herd placements.  The first phase of a player's turn is mandatory drift, which means playing a card to move a hex tile of that type.  A easily learned rules govern movement and placement.  The second phase allows a player to spend up to 4 action points to drift a tile without playing a card (3 ap), move a herd to an adjacent hex (1 ap), rescue up to 3 swimmers onto an adjacent hex (1 ap), or reproduce a herd (1 ap).  It is a majority of herds on a continent (a group of tiles not touching other tiles or including the south pole tile) that give control.  1st and 2nd place score points.  Swimmers occur if a tile is drifted and herds are on it: the herds are dumped into the ocean, the tile moves to a new location.  Scoring occurs during play if new continents are formed under certain conditions and again after the meteor strike occurs.

It's between Gheos and Carcassonne in complexity and screwage: meaner and a little more complex than Carc, but not as mean as Gheos.

Components: Beautiful tiles and cards, per usual for Doris Matthäus. The game desperately needs a board with preprinted hexes indicating their distance from the South Pole.

Experience: Interesting game play as the super-continent breaks up, and it becomes more and more difficult to invade someone's point-making island. Opportunities to fill up a tile, to prevent swimmers from coming to shore; and for dumping dinos into the sea when they have nowhere else to go. A bit dry; not super exciting.

RATING: 7
What a strange and wonderful beast this game is. It's a thematically-rich abstract! Curious? Read on. 

Players control massive herds of dinosaurs that roam the earth in the triassic period. The goal of the game is to have the largest number of dinosaurs on each of the islands (preferably the largest ones) at the time the meteor strikes, signifying the end of the game. Each turn, land masses break off from the core continent and shift outward, possibly stranding dinosaurs in the water. This sounds very thematic, and it is, but the core mechanics of the game are very structured and feel somewhat like an abstract puzzle. 

When shifting land masses, the player must constantly be aware of how many dinos she has (and the opponents have) on each land mass, because the player with the majority scores 2 points when a new land mass is created. Even more difficult, though, is that the player must track everyone else's potential moves before making their own, lest she be abandoned with multiple herds on a rinky-dink, low-scoring island. This all makes for a lot of calculation, hence the abstract feeling, but because all of this makes perfect sense within the context of the theme, it ends up feeling very thematic, in my opinion.

After the initial land mass moves each turn, the player has 4 action points to divide up however she likes and in what order she likes. The four possible actions each cost one action point, except for moving another land mass which costs 3 points. The player can also move a dino to an adjacent hex, reproduce to birth a new dino, or rescue up to 3 swimming dinosaurs. 

When any player randomly draws the Meteor Strike card, the round is completed, and the continents that remain are scored. Now this is when the majority of points are typically scored. The player with the majority of dinos on a particular landmass scores 1 point for every hex the island contains, second largest presence gets half, and everyone else gets nothing. 

This is a wonderful game with a good amount of replay value to due the puzzle elements, different strategies, and the fact the hex map is randomly generated each game. It's really quite innovative and I definitely recommend it, especially for the price.

Up there with Vinci in the purely evil game category.  No hidden information, no secret moves.  There is more oppurtunities for peaceful play than Vinci (read: any), but still, when you sink a tile and then crowd the shore full so an opponent can't get back on, you know you've done a bad thing.

RATING: 7
A simple, but deceptively clever game.  Players try to maintain a presence of their dinosaurs on a giant continet as it's gradually breaking up into smaller land masses.  During a turn, a piece has to break off a land mass and move further away from the "south pole", then players get to spend action points on their dinosaurs to keep them out of the water and breeding.  As new land masses are created, points are awarded for presence there.  At the end of the game, every land mass is scored for presence.  Very clever game.

Jury's still out on this.  I'm normally not a big fan of majority-control scoring (not to mention action points), but I find the hex-drift mechanism fascinating.

A game that is heavier and more analytical than you would expect from the theme; has some fiddly hex-drift rules that definitely take some experience to get used to-- this is not a good game for casual or non-gamers.

This is a short, well-themed, and innovative design. I wish we could see more from the game's author. 

There are really tricky tactical plays to made that can be devastating to your opponents, but it takes a couple of plays to really see them and defend against them. The game gets really interesting when played at this level as it's more about managing different threats while trying to maintain a majority. 

Much better than the 6.6 rating it gets, and that may be due to players only giving it one or two tries.

I thought this would be a tile-laying game, however it's more of a tile-moving/area control game.  The game feels a little unintuitive to me and I wonder how much luck the cards will play in the game after getting experienced in it.  My biggest criticism for the game is that it should have come in a tube with a large cloth 'board' that have pre-printed hexes on it.  The reason I say this is so you could more easily determine if the place where you wish to move a tile is actually further away from the center tile than it's original location.

Under-rated gem, in my mind.  the 'drift' mechanism is way fun, makes the board ever-changing.  Plus, it's sort of passive-aggressive - you aren't actually eliminating anyone or their herds, you just send them into the drink.  For my daughter, who can really get upset when she is directly damaged in a game, this was not as bad.  Perhaps a way to ease someone into more confrontational games.  The decision between drift vs. move vs. reproduce is always interesting.

Yucata.de is to thank for introducing this game to me, the implementation there is great, and helps deal with the scoring...

Bought 12/12/02. Played once - but found out that we played it the wrong way (having each player one phase, then each playing the second phase, etc.). This did effect the rating, since we felt that the last player in a round had the advantage. However, we still enjoyed the game and found it to be very chess-like, but interesting. We definitely want to play it again using the right rules (i.e., Player A plays all phases, then Player B, etc.). This one is definitely worth a second look. 10/03 - sold it. Not that it&#039;s bad. It isn&#039;t. But, with all the other games I own, it will just never get to the table. So I let it have a good owner.

An interesting offering.  Trias is another one of those rare euros for me that is truly thematic -  A lot of players find this game dry, however.  I find the shifting tiles (the continental drift) and the moving herds to be very much aligned to the theme.  Trias is an area control game at heart, but offers the unique mechanic of having a dynamic modular board allowing for unique and interesting scoring opportunities..  A lot of games have rules for random set ups to give an appearance for change, but Trias allows for an entire game that changes every turn.  In my opinion Trias is underrated, and offers a fresh twist to it's crowded genre.

Only played three times before I realized Trias just wasn't the right game for my group.  My fiancee, a seasoned gamer himself, just couldn't process the rules and got moody and grumpy.  A fun game, the rules are just laid out in a way that some brains have trouble grasping.

This is a pretty good strategy game that reminds me a bit of Taluva. In this case, you have to try to have the most dinosaur herds on the continents as they are slowly separated with tile movement on each player's turn. First placement means a lot, but strategic moves throughout mean the most. Jumping out quickly and maintaining the dominant presence on larger continents can win the day. It has a pretty good stick-it-to-the-other guy factor as well.

A basic majorities-in-regions game with one major curveball that dominates the game: continental drift.  The concept of a dynamic board geography is nothing new, but the way it's implemented here is fascinating.  Regions continually drift and break apart and rejoin and change shape.  The mechanism that powers the drifting works well and allows for some interesting tactics.

Excellent game ! The only fiddly bit is determining if a tile is farther away from the southpole or not. In the beginning this is pretty obvious, but sometimes situations arise where it is not so clear. I really have to make a hex-grid to help determine distances more easily.

A simple but very cool tile placement game where the tiles represent the splitting apart of ancient continents. Trying to keep your herds alive, on land and in the majority is much more challenging than it seems and really lots of fun. I love the little lizard meeples and the tile placement rules actually feel really thematic (less so the rules about swimmers). I do feel like the official 2 player game removes too many tiles from the game. I think it'd be more fun to play with just the full map, even with 2 players.

In essence, an area control game with a unique mechanic that simulates continental drift and changes the board on every player turn. It is little boring with two players, but much better with more. It would have been visually more appealing with plastic miniatures, of course, but at least they replaced the ridiculous wooden cubes of the first edition with pieces that have some resemblance to animals.

Played 2 player.  Very high angst level, and close games are produced using the 2 player rules.  I think it would be a fairly different game with more than 2 players (and using the multiplayer rules).  Have now played 3 player and it was very different; one player hived off a continent by themselves very early (which had 11 tiles), but then couldn't get anywhere near the other 2 players who continued to dominate the other continent which just kept splitting and rejoining for most of the game. (the 3rd player did have dinos on this island but could never get a majority)

Bought this game for the theme and the innovative "continental drift" mechanic.  But found the rules a bit confusing, and the gameplay much drier than the description would suggest.  And although the little dinosaur meeples are cool (can stand on 2 legs or 4), the rest of the artwork leaves alot to be desired.  I was happy to play it but my wife really did not enjoy it, so we gave it to a friend.

RATING: 8
Mechanically, this game is incredibly clever and I have yet to see something else like it yet -- the way in which continental drift occurs (and is controlled) is brilliant. The game is relatively easy to teach, cute, and easy to tote around (i.e., the box is bigger than need be). Some complain that the scoring can be broken and I would agree that should players treat this game as multi-player solitaire, it comes down to whoever exploits the system best. However, when everyone is in the know and plays aggressively, this game is a lot of fun and is anyone's game right until the end.

RATING: 7
Interesting game of area control, with a twist--the hexes drift every turn. This means that the dino-meeples may find themselves swimming (and eventually drowning) if a landscape hex underneath them is suddenly shifted elsewhere.

A cute game, with simple mechanics, and rapid playability. The rules are confusing at first, regarding the drift of the hexes. This is the only reason I am hesitant in bringing this to the table. Otherwise, it can be great fun, with lots of screw-your-neighbor plays, trying to drown your opponents' dinosaur herds. Rules take about 10 minutes to explain. Plays in 60 minutes. A nice, compact game.

Update (12/18/09) 2 plays: After owning this game for several years, and playing it a few times, I finally 'get' it. In what seems to be a swirling mass of chaos, there is a game of strategy and tactics. Control of specific terrain hexes, making sure to reproduce up to the limit of that hex (Mountains can hold up to 2 herds, plains 3, and forest 4) is key, but everybody picks up on that quickly. The way islands are broken away was taking too long; you cannot rely on the mandatory drift, you must use 3 action points to drift a tile on your own; you must also use the two randomly located 'lakes' to help breakaway new islands. In this manner, players can rack up 1 or 2 VP, but at a sacrifice of growth. Still, you won't need to grow if you're the only one on a newly formed continent! Purposely making your herds swim and then rescuing them is another key tactic. You can essentially move three herds for 1 action point.

Every player has four action points each turn. In this manner, it is similar to Tikal, which has 10 action points, but this game doesn't or shouldn't suffer from analysis paralysis; the menu of actions is very short: drift a tile for 3 AP, move a herd for 1 AP, reproduce for 1 AP, or save up to three swimmers for 1 AP. I like this game, now that I get it, and hope to bring it to the table more often.

First played July 10th, 2007.  Taught in about 10 minutes and played in about an hour with 3 players.  This game appears to weigh towards the strategy spectrum, however there is some luck in what your opponents decide to do in their turns.  It's an enjoyable game that can be played every now and then.  If your looking for an anlysis game, this is a good canidate.  I'd recommend giving it a game play if you know someone that has the game.

RATING: 5
Hmm, there appears to be something in this game worth salvaging for a closer inspection.  The game is pretty close to crossing the threshold to goodness, but is held back by the counter-intuitive feel and dryness (not in theme, but decision making).  I've already begun adding in some "evolution" cards ala Urland/Primordial Soup to spice things up a bit and get this game over the hump.  I will report back on the degree to my success later.

Update:  Traded away.  The game wasn't bad but it just felt unintuitive.  There seemed to always be a better choice of game when deciding what to play.  -A little bit of a shame really.

Creative strategy game. English translated rules are a bit clunky, but not impossible to decipher. Appears simple enough to be a shorter game, but strategy decisions can make each players' turns stretch into a medium to long game.

Based on our first and so far only play.  I really wanted to like this game.  The game concept is neat, but the "drifting" mechanic is unintuitive and described poorly in the rulebook.  The lack of an underlying board adds a bit to this confusion once multiple continents are formed.  (although this can be remedied by creating your own hex grid to play on).  I believe a second playing of this game has the potential to go much better.  However, with the other games in my collection its hard seeing this hitting the table again soon.

(UPDATE: nobody wanted to waste game time trying it again so we traded it away 8/05)

I am a little disappointed I traded this away so quickly but it was kind of crappy with 2 players (rating 4 maybe) and that was going to be its main purpose. I can see from other comments that with at least 3 players the game will be much better and I knew that but I did think in the end it wouldnt get any table time after one play. 

Would like to play again with 3 or 4 players, I suspect 3 to be best for control/competition ratio.

This game is about continental drift... sure it happens in a kind of crazy way... but the theme is undeniably cool. It's area majority and there is a very neat aspect of having to trigger the scoring which can be very difficult to wrap your head around at first. The game can also feel a bit chaotic with a large number of players, but this is a very minor complaint. The game is great fun and there are always interesting decisions to make.

----

I played a 2p game and really didn't like the experience at all. You no longer get points for forming islands so the goal of the game shifts entirely to majority battles for islands. Things end up being very symmetric if players cohabit islands (which will be the case for the majority of the islands). And the round up for second place benefits the person behind on islands with an odd number of tiles. I think good 2p rules could be devised, but the ones they published are not them.

RATING: 7
Trias takes the action point mechanism known from Tikal and combines it with an abstract core of moving pieces across a board and – most interesting – moving parts of the board itself. Thematically, the actions represent the migration and reproduction of dinosaurs respectively the continental drift. Players aim to have the majority of species in the resulting new continents.

Even when it came out in 2002, Trias must have felt old-fashioned compared to games like Tikal or Evo which offer similar mechanisms and/or theme far more chromy, multi-facetted, approachable and inviting. Trias has a few abstract rules. The richness of play stems from the open nature of gameplay which leaves modern Eurogamers who are used to a more channeled gameplay, puzzled. It’s a brainy retro way of gaming but has its charm for those willing to think a minute about a move and watch things develop slowly.

The cards that dictate your free move make this a very random game.  You can use 3 of your 4 actions to shift one of the tiles, thus negating some of the poor luck of the card draw, but that takes away actions that could have been used reproducing or moving your dinos.  Still, it can be a nice one-hour game.

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much to deal with here. This is one of the most complex games I've attempted to figure out, and it's not even that complex in terms of its rules - it's complex in terms of figuring out how you're going to score even a handful of points. Since most of the scoring occurs at the end, you have to make most of your choices with the long-term in mind. Yet there are so many things that can happen between one turn and the next, it becomes nearly impossible to foresee how your next move is going to help you win. Just plain couldn't enjoy this much brain burning.

This one just didn't catch my interest. Great original idea and I liked the concept of the board moving around but there were enough exceptions that arose in the few times I played it that it left a bad taste in my mouth. It's actually more fun for me to watch this game be played than to play it myself. We didn't have a mat when we played... if you have access to one, I'd HIGHLY recommend it. The constant shifting and adjusting of the tiles was probably the main reason I got turned off to this one. Score may rise if I play it a bit more but I'm scared it may also fall further if I play it more. So I'll just stop playing it.

My group and I were less than dazzled after our first play. Several plays later: it's here to stay. The theme is definitely fun, if you can accept that masses of land are drifting in such erratic fashions, while leaving their residents in the drink. The mechanisms, scoring and their exceptions are difficult to remember and explain, but it's all worth it in the end. [b]8[/b]

RATING: N/A
Not a lot of info (Can buy cheap on BBG)

Dinosaurs reside on the modular hexagons of the super-continent Pangaea. Each hex can only support a certain number of animals. Not only that, the continent is splitting up with parts of the land disappearing and new lands emerging elsewhere. Players try to disperse as widely as is wise while still dominating each continent where they exist. The game ends as the meteorite strikes, ending the age of the great dinosaurs.

Excellent game with unique board play mechanic.  Although theme is a bit abstract for some, but I think it's a good realistic theme "IF" the board is viewed as a sphere or globe of shifting tectonic plates where hexes are "emerging and submerging" land tiles.  It could be very dry if abstracts generally don't appeal to you but I'm very fond of playing it...

RATING: 7
Played two games of this back-to-back, and it was a ton of fun.  I honestly don't understand where people get the idea that this is abstract.  If you really find yourself having a hard time grappling with the theme, try reading a little bit about island biogeography as well as the punctuated equilibrium version of the theory of evolution.  They should make the theme snap clearly into focus.  Overall, a great tactical game with a couple of opportunities per game for each player to make a really impressive play (I've literally gotten light applause for a sequence of moves I've made).  I fully expect my rating will only go up with further play unless there is a major bug that we haven't hit yet.

UPDATE: Played it again, and really enjoyed it again, but I'm starting to see some hints of fragility to it.  It seems as though the only way for the player interaction to remain at the level that makes this game so fun is for players to play some defense, but if you are playing defense against two players that are focused solely on offense you'll get hammered.  As a result, I'm leaving my rating at 8 for now, with future movement most likely to be dictated by how this issue resolves itself with further play.

UPDATE: Played an extremely bad, unfun game. At this point I would say that it has one more chance to redeem itself in my eyes, perhaps playing with 4, or it will hit the trade pile.

UPDATE: I bumped it back up to 7 after quite a fun play, following a long fallow period. We'll see if future plays bear this out.

A fun and challenging game of both strategy and tactics. The drifting mechanics are, taken together, excellent.

The best part, and what really drives the game, is that you can pull off some subtle, clever, fun and thoroughly evil moves.

3 / 5 - Good.

There's a lot to like about this game. The tile drifting mechanic that allows the board to slowly split and reshape itself into islands during the course of the game is highly unusual and interesting. There's a reasonable screwage factor to introduce a bit of interaction and there's plenty of strategy to mull over. Currently wondering if there's a game-breaking approach to it, though, and it may not be quite engaging enough for a higher rating. But then again, with a few more plays to sort these issues out, it could rise to an 8 maybe.

Received Feb 1, 2007 

Only played a few times. Rules seem a little weak in spots. I enjoy the game but your turn ends up being mostly an exercise in optimizing chaos.  Very little you can do to plan between turns.  On your turn you evaluate the board, look at your cards, make a play, and take your lumps.

Feels like something that would be funner against AI on a computer.  At least you wouldn't have to wait so long between turns and it would keep the tiles in their correct positions in the ever expanding board.

This is a fairly deep, multi-player, abstract.  The theme is well implemented though.  Cute dinosaurs help a lot.  I also advise getting a large hex-map to keep the hex-tile positions straight while the continents break up... A blue rubber shelf liner might also help keep the tiles from shifting.

Area dominance game where players can manipulate the tiles to advantage or detriment of self and others. Mid levels of direct player interaction, slightly long play times (over an hour for three players) for what is offeres.

Not really recommended, but not advised against either.

You can tell it's a Euro because the dinosaurs are all plant eaters. A better game would demand--demand, I say!--T-Rex.

I concede that it's the best game I've ever played about continental drift. Okay, so it's the only one.

Area control. Action points. Score the herds. Euro, Euro, Euro. Meh, meh, meh.

Don't believe any of the comments that say the game is complicated or confusing or that the rules are hard to decipher. Seriously? I sat down with one person, and we learned the rules and played a first game. We had to check the rules a few times, as with any game, but no one who has ever played a wargame or AmeriTrash should struggle with this fairly short rule set.

Still...dinosaurs! So +1 for that.

I have to agree with my friend Mark who expounded that Trias is a bit like go.  Simple mechanics, extremely wide open, a mix of strategy/tactics and a game that can change drastically with one movement (or drift).    I dig the theme of this game and cannot wait to play it again.

Almost a filler, and a thoughtful one at that.  Best with 3 players.  The drifting part is cool but I'm pretty sure the example for scoring the X tile as it moves to the rightmost "D" positions is wrong in the rulebook (in other words, those rightmost positions do initiate a score).  Aside from that bit of drift scoring confusion, there is some fun to be had here and the rules are easily understood.

Played once.  An area-influence game wherein players place dinosaurs onto land tiles on the continent pangea.  Tiles slowly move away from the center of the map, forming new continents; players with the majority of dinosaurs on a continent score points.  With four players there was a lot of competition, as dinosaurs often got dumped into the ocean or blocked out of certain areas.  The game is very strategic, though I found planning ahead to be hard as much could change in one round.  Scoring is a bit complex, but understandable once the game starts (and if you're playing with smart people).

The game desperately needs a hex-grid board/sheet/background that displays how far each land tile (hex) is from the center of the map.  The reason for this is that land tiles must always be moved further away from the center then they are initially, but as the map breaks apart it becomes extremely hard to figure out how far each spot is from the center.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
“Trias” is a unique game of “drifting” tiles and managing your dinosaur herds. Once you get the concept of "drifting" this game reveals itself as a strategic territorial acquisition game. There's no direct conflict in the game but there's definitely ways to screw with other players. A fun light-medium game that requires a good, big playing area.

Trias is a solid game. It plays best with more players in my opinion... so you can have different conflicts with several players in various areas.

The game play can be quite brutal and tempers can flare when you dump an opponents dino in the drink. An overall very solid little game whose rating may climb with more play.

Each player controls dinosaurs, living on hexagonal pieces in a giant land mass. Every turn, an hexagonal land piece must be moved. Each player gets action points to move, reproduce, move an island piece or swim (if someone moves your island, and you have pieces on it). Interim scoring takes place when a new island is formed - player with most pieces on island gets 2 pts, second place gets 1 pt. In final scoring, the player with the most pieces on island scores a point for each hex on the island, second place gets half. It's an okay game and can be tactical. We had some minor trouble with the rules regarding when interim scoring takes place. It feels like your dinosaurs could get scattered all over through no fault of your own, and it is a slightly longer game, clocking in at 2 hrs.

Doesn't work very well with 2 players - it certainly doesn't have the tactics or strategic feel of many, better 2-player games.

It worked much better with 3 players - I want to play it another time or two before I give it a rating, though.

Not a bad game, just not what I was expecting. Trias is actually a majority-stock game like Acquire, Alhambra, Union Pacific etc., but with continents instead of companies and dinos instead of shares. I don't think the theme fits the mechanics very well (especially the scoring system), but not bad overall.

This game benefits from a bonus .5 for being the best dinosaur game I have ever played.  Pretty simple game, there is a lot of momentum for players who can get early points.  The scoring mechanics can be abused pretty easily by reconnecting and breaking off repeatedly in the same turn.  The play area gets sloppy and it would have been nice if the game included a survive like map to keep track of shifting pieces.

I was unsold on this one. Each move provides plenty to think about, meaning some down time. The cubes just didn't feel like herds of dinosaurs though, and so the game left me cold as just another clever little thing. But I do like clever little things, so a mixed reaction.

Very much a cross between Gheos and Carcassonne -- with dinosaur placement on pieces of Pangea that are drifting apart from the South Pole. I like that it is a little more cut throat than Carcassonne, yet it seemed a little easier than Gheos (perhaps just the physical separation of the pieces made it easier to plan optimal moves.) 

D also enjoyed this one.

An excellent, quick game with lots of tactical choices.  Feels sort of like a baby El Grande mixed with Survive! on drifting tiles.  Now comes with wooden lizards instead of cubes.  I've like it best with 3 so far.  Two is ridiculously dull, and four took a smidgeon longer than I liked.

I received this in a math trade and it find it very good and unique.  I've only played it once so I won't rate it, but my initial reaction is very positive.  I like how the board and game is very organic, insofar as everything is in a constant flux yet fairly predictable.  This organic style of game play lends itself nicely to the theme of the game - the creation of continents and the survival of the species.

The first game was good, and was a real strategic brain burner, where my opponent beat me by sharing residence on my island at the last minute. Surprisingly small dinomeeples.

Only one 2-player and two 3-player games so far, sightly generous as a 7. There is quite a bit of room for clever play that will need more playings to optimize. Keeping the spatial arrangements can be a bit challenging at time when it comes to reconnections. Not as interesting as Urland but quite quick with an interesting continental drift mechanic. There may be a few too many cards and maybe both 1st & 2nd decks should be reduced by about 10%. The vicious screwage potential makes this a poor SO two-player game.

An intriguing little area control game that uses an interesting mechanism for determining the areas that are under contentino. Players 'drift' the tiles outward from the single Pangaean continent, creating smaller continents populated by their little dinos. The size of these continents affects their eventual value, so players want to have majorities in the biggest ones.

Tias, a game where the continental drift gives you whiplash.

The board is made up of a number of hexagonal tiles arranged in a hexagonal grid representing Pangaea.  Each tile represents one of three different terrain types.  There is also a deck of cards that show one of the three terrain types.  At the beginning of the game players will have a number of dinosaur herds on Pangaea.  On a turn players must use a card to move a tile of the matching terrain type, possibly creating new continents.  Then they can use action points to move dinos, reproduce dinos or even move an additional tile.  When the comet card is drawn the game plays one more round then ends.   During play when a new continent is formed it scores points for the players who have dinos on the new continent.  When the game ends there is a super scoring round where all continents are scored based on their size.

There are some odd-ball rules to Trias.  There is no underlying board so as the continents drift apart you may need to use one of the unused tiles to measure just how far a tile is from the central Pangaean tile.  The drifting rules themselves take some getting used to.  The oddest (yet funnest) rule is that if a tile drifts, any dinos on it will get dumped into the sea.  If the tile drifts to a location where dinos happen to be floating they will find themselves suddenly on dry land.  But this plays an important part in the game's strategy.  It uses fewer action points to move dinos from water to land than it does to move dinos from one land tile to another.  On the other hand, any dinos you fail to rescue by the end of your turn die.

Not only is the board moving around under your dinos, but your dinos need to move and reproduce so they can dominate the new continents as they get created.  Each tile, depending on the type of terrain, has a population limit.  These limits cannot be violated.  If a hex is full, your dinos can't reproduce, however they can block movement through the tile to keep other players from horning in on your territory.  The result is a game that requires a lot of swirling geometrical thinking and clever placement of both tiles and dinos.  A game where every decision has a number of pros and cons.  Normally the game moves along quickly, but it could devolve into some analysis paralysis.  The cards alleviate this potential to a degree and give the game its chaotic spice.  Trias would dry up without a little bit of unpredictability in the way Pangaea drifts apart.  For those that don't want randomness I suspect it's possible to dispense with the cards as anything other then a game clock.

RATING: 6.5
Only worth playing for 4+ players, otherwise, there's not enough competition.

A Euro that features movement, which is quite rare

Ample room for clever plays. Dying because of overcrowding or sinking might be good because it allows you to redistribute your dinosaurs much easier.

Many of the comments complain about the spatial aspect of the game in which you always have to move a tile further from the center. This is actually very easy to do.

Surprisingly thematic for such a streamlined game.

Enjoyed playing with the designer at Essen 2007!  Cool concept of the continents drifting apart, nice clean clever system with some aha-tactics.  I'd played a couple times years ago in Austin and was eager to try again at Essen, and was not disappointed.

The 2-player version is OK but less interesting than multiplayer, which adds additional tactics as intermediate scoring happens when islands are formed.

A game of continental drift and area control that is exponentially better with a game board/hex grid. Great artwork by Doris, and extremely solid game mechanics. A slight learning curve on tile drift and scoring mechanics. No game is ever the same, and because of that, it requires a fluid and adaptable strategy.

Bumped my rating up a bit. I continue to think this game is highly underrated here on the geek. It's certainly a brain burner, but in a good way. the variability from game to game is significant, and because of that the replay value is very high. I'd definitely like to play this one more often.

Played this recently.  Interesting mechanism where continents break apart and you score points for dominance over a newly created continent. There is both interim scoring and end of game scoring. We found out that the interim and end of game scoring are probably about equally important. There are a fair number of actions you can do each round which creates many possibilities. Much like Carcasonne, this game seems to fit a complex package inside of a small box. Recommended.

This is "the dinosaur game" to my four year old, who plays with only slightly modified rules.

Played once; three-player.

The mechanics seem pretty abstract, but the theme fits quite well.  Strong game, but as the game proceeded, I felt more and more like I was trying to prevent inevitable catastrophe as players can change majorities simply by moving the ground right out from under your feet.

The drifting rules are a minor hurdle for new players, otherwise a very simple game to grasp. I wish there was maybe just one more element to this game - maybe something from Urland would make it amazing.

I found little plastic dinos at Lakeshore Learning Centers that work great with this game.

A neat little game. Players are moving their heards of dinos around constantly shifting and reforming parcels of land.

It's an area control game with a twist that works. The movement of tiles are dictated by the card that the players draw at the end of each turn.

One tile movement could change the entire pace of the game. It's dynamic and players should try to spread their dinos out instead of getting clustered in one continent.

FUN!

The 2-player variant in the rules was OK, but nothing special.  Playing 2-player with 2 colors was wonderful though.  It has that 'I want to do so much but can't' feeling that makes for tough and agonising decisions.  Plus dino-meeples! With more people, I enjoyed it a lot, but have seen a problem that the phase 1 cards stack is just a little too long, which means the game reaches a holding pattern where no-one can do very much to change their position and everyone is waiting for the comet.  Ditching a few of the phase 1 cards made for a much tighter game in our hands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Strategy is quite difficult in this game, as you always have many options and all of them have a chain of effects to be considered.  The drift mechanic seemed to be clunky, like they made a mechanic and added a lot of stuff to fix it, rather than just making a good mechanic.  I'm sure a few more plays will change my outlook on the game, but I'm not sure for the better or worse.

OK, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.  Many people have been describing this as an abstract game, this might be thrown off by the fact that the European version has cubes instead of Dinosaurs.  Nonetheless, after playing it I feel that there is most definitely a theme here and it feels like you are playing little herds of dinosaurs scrambling to shifting continents.  

In the BGG glossary abstract is defined as : Having greatly simplified concepts and actions, rather than strict attention to detail, in order to facilitate game play. Often used as opposite of thematic.  I guess in some ways this game is really simplified down to the bare minimum, but most German games are nowadays.  In my opinion, this is one of the few games recently released that actually feels like what the theme is trying to convey.  

About the game itself, the tile movement is clever and the level of choices are high.  I find the system to be as fun to interact with as the other players.  The two player game works, but it is better  with more as they snubbed the island scoring and abbreviated the game significatly. While it certainly won't ever be in my top 10, I have a good time playing it.  For me that's all that matters (although it has a tendency to painfully creep along at one or two points a turn, which somewhat prohibits any sense of the power move).

Torn on this one, and my rating will probably improve with more plays.  I've played this once as a three player game, and I found it enjoyable and interesting.  I've also played it once as a two player game, and that was just crap.  So, my advice would be to play this with three or more.

A really fun little tile-moving and area control game, with a Triassic-era theme of dinosaurs and drifting continents.  Nice components, and not difficult to learn (easy and quick once you've got the hang of it).  Definite scope for some strategy, but also plenty of opportunity for others to mess it up for you.  There is also enough in the game so that (to me anyway) the theme doesn't feel totally irrelevant and 'pasted on' (which is a pet hate of mine).  

An essential acquisition if you like dinos, evolution etc, and still recommended if you don't.

In the few plays I have had, I have found this mainly a game of tactical decision, as you can easily be limited in your options on your go, it is impossible to accurately plan ahead.

Picked this up in a math trade and didn't realize I was getting an edition cubes instead of dinomeeples, so have been using the camels from Oasis instead.

Interesting area control/area majority game where parts of the hex-map can be moved to create new areas. Needs more plays to see if I like it because of the novelty of a continental drift mechanic or because it really works.

[RGG 'Trias' 2002 edition] {Dinosaurs; drifting, action-point, area-majority; optimal 3p} Trias is basically an area-majority game where players have to move their dinosaurs between islands. The 'drifting' concept is unique and that's why it comes into my collection.

Trias is a tactical game with plenty of interaction. It's highly dynamic and very replayable It's a moderately deep game, where players have to make several decisions each turn due to the action-point system. Although the landscape to be drifted is somewhat forced each turn, players can still make good use of it to create a map that is most helpful for them.

The intermediate scoring is easy to understand; though it slightly disturbs the game flow. Even when there are rounds of mid-term scoring, the end-game scoring is the most important things. I usually started to plan for the end-game during the mid-game (after half of the deck is used) and I usually try to spread my dinosaurs on different islands.

Enjoyable enough but I found some of the later stages hard going; it's gets harder to decide how to "drift" land areas when there are several islands on the go, plus "wars" between players on adjacent islands seem too messy for such an otherwise light game.

RATING: 8
I really like the drifting mechanism, something I have never seen in another game. Lot's of opportunities to help yourself and harm your opponent. The drifting rules need to be read carefully, but after you have done it a couple of times, it becomes second nature and each turn goes quickly. When playing with three, don't forget to remove 1 or 2 of each type of card from the "1" stack, otherwise the game drags a bit.

Great mechanic, looks great, but it felt a little "dry." I wish there was a little more going on in the game. Haven't given up on it, though, and will definitly play a few more times.

Trias is an action-point, area majority game that I really want to like, but has fell flat a few times. The game starts with a Pangea of tiles that slowly drift apart to form different continents. Players control a herd of dinosaurs and have 4 action points on each turn to spend moving their dinosaurs around and reproducing. The goal is to have the majority on the largest continents when the meteor hits Earth and the game ends (i.e., a card near the bottom of the deck will show a picture of a meteor entering Earth’s atmosphere). It can take longer than it should because it’s an action-point game, which provides a lot of flexibility on your turns (which I like), but maybe it’s too open-ended for its own good. I know I’ll keep trying Trias because there’s a game in there that I think I’ll enjoy. Although I’ll warn you that the two-player game has too many rules tweaks to be worthwhile and the five-player game has too much downtime to keep me awake, but the three-player game has a lot of potential.

RATING: 7
[thing=4249][/thing] is an area control and area enclosure game in which players control herds of dinosaurs in movement through Pangaea while it splits, forming the new continents. The goal is to make have the most points at the end of the game, and these are given each time a new land mass is formed, and, in final scoring, when each land mass will give points accordingly to the size (number of hexagons) of them.

The rules summary, per the description, is: players begin by placing herds of their dinosaurs on the single continent of Pangea, made from tiles of various terrain types. They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds. Players have 4 action points to spend on other optional actions, including another drift, migrating herds, rescuing swimming herds and reproducing to create more herds.

The mechanical part of moving herds and reproducing to increase presence and control is very common in this genre of games - what takes [thing=4249][/thing] apart from the rest is the constant movement of the continental drift, as the hexagons that form the boards are moved, forming new regions. Afterwards, these same areas can also be divided, or united with others, creating bridges from where new herds can come, changing the control and value of the regions. Is a constant dispute and one that is highly fun to see develop during play.

Furthermore, area control games often tend to be "violent", with gains and losses, and relentless attacks. In [thing=4249][/thing] there is some of this, but in an attenuated and friendlier form: herds aren't lost - even when left "swimming" by the drift of a tile, rescue them is easy. The continental drift can cause damage to the pretensions of points of someone, yet, with some planning and care, there are often opportunities to recover lost ground and even expand it.

[thing=4249][/thing] offers a nice amount of timming and preparation through positioning - being in a good place in key moments can be worth a lot, as well as antecipating the possible drifts and changes in the land. Still, the learning curve isn't too steep, as the rules are quite straightforward, clean and lean.

Overall, [thing=4249][/thing] is a good game, giving many decision points, constant interaction and a fine replay value. The looks of it can be lackluster (specially the german edition, with the cubes instead of the dinomeeples), yet the mechanics are solid and provide a nice enviroment and a reasonable playing time. Recommended.

One play so far:  it is definitely fun and the theme and mechanism somehow work (don't think too much about it, esp. the drowning part).  But maybe that's because we were just at the Royal Tyrell Museum the day before playing...

A bit prone to analysis paralysis - so maybe best played with a timer (or while drinking?).

We had bought this for our 6 year old boy, but having previewed it ourselves in a 2 player game, it will wait a while.  I think he could grasp the basics, but just the basics.

The action-point system had me thinking of Tikal (which i love) - AP and all.

I thought I had an idea of what I wanted to do at the beginning.  That didn't really work.  Then I saw someone else make a play that seemed really good, but they came in last.  I think I know what I would try next time, but will that be any better?  I like the way the board breaks apart, but it seems hard to predict or manipulate how that's going to happen.  I thought it was pretty good and there might be some control there that I haven't quite gotten the hang of.

After three plays, this game has worked its charms on me.  Once you get the drifting down, the gameplay is rather simple, but there is tactical depth, and the game board is radically different at the end of each game.  I think I'll be playing Trias for a long time to come.

Mechanics lead to a nice visual as the "Pangaean" continent splits up. Unforgiving, almost zero-sum with 2. I think 4 players is probably the sweet spot. Somewhat vulnerable to analysis paralysis. The rejoining of previously separated continents can create big surprises.

An abstract game that completely loses any feeling of theme once the game starts.  Sure, the continental drift is an interesting idea, but the scoring system is antithematic.

This is possibly the weirdest implementation of a territorial control mechanism in a game, but I like it.  It's a nearly-perfect information game, with the deck of cards introducing the randomness to keep the games from becoming too static, and the placement of the hexes to ensure that a different board is played each game.  This is another game that I would like to play more often, because it's a unique little title.

visually, it's borderlike awful. it's quite cumbersome to handle dinos and tiles.
as a game, it's not that bad and you have often interesting decisions to make. Unfortunately, luck can be too important, if you need to split a continent but you don't have a card, you will lose too many action points.
The rules are too complicated for what it is and splitting points at the end requires an explanation with 8 examples, wow! It's the first scoring system where I have to use the double rounding up!! I lile the theme but it doesnt help remembering how things work.

If you like majority games, give it a try because it is, after all, quite original and interesting as mechanics.

The need to expand outwards is confusing when the continents spread and separate. The whole "moving tiles" was also limiting, in my opinion- there should have been a way to flip them into different land types (which, by the way, were difficult to remember) or add/delete tiles. That would have made it more complex but also perhaps easier to "get" or at least more entertaining. Overall, I found the game boring. I struggled the most with figuring out how to make islands or separations in a way that benefited me- or at all, for that matter. It reminded me of Survive but the theme did not work as well.

RATING: 5
Cool tile drifting mechanic aside, let me count the problems that make Trias such a chore to play:

1. Extremely fiddly.  Since this is basically an area majority game, one would expect that eventually there will be more pieces in play than not.  Which would be ok if the board remains stationary and unchanging.  However, that is not the case!  Imagine having to pick up the dino-meeples every time a land becomes detached and moved around the table, how about doing it ad nauseam?  At least in Roads and Boats I only deal with my own pieces.

2. Having to make sure a tile is further from the south pole than it was originally.  Try doing that with lots of vacant spaces in between.  Is that 5 or 6 hexes?  Argh.

3. Unintentional kingmaking.  I know it's an oxymoron, but seriously, it happens way too often that someone will be so wrapped up with saving his herd that as a result of reconnecting a continent he gave another person the perfect scoring opportunity to break it off again.

4. Complicated and unintuitive rules.

So yeah, stick with the tried and true El Grande, these dinosaurs are better left to extinction.

A pretty decent, tense game that I'd like to play a few more times.  2-player seems pretty bad; my wife and I played once and it seems as though the game should always end in a tie.  Good with 3 players, though.

I wanted to love this game.  I mean, dinomeeples!  Come on!  

But it's just crying out for a board with color-coded rings or something.  It gets progressively harder to tell when you're making an illegal continental drift.

Aside from that, this game might be too abstract even for me.

Only played with 2. A bit static, feels like it's over before it is.

Edit: Now that I've played with 3, I can see the game's potential, though I still feel that you run out of interesting moves before the game runs out of cards. (This is an easy fix, of course.)

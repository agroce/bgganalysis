RATING: 7
Remarkably good with 2 players. Gets dragged out and becomes quite chaotic as you add more people. 

The scoring is a bit weird. Doubling points for a complete set of suits is *way* too powerful.

Every game results in laughs, some "Ah-ha!" moments, funny situations, and good times. That right there is the mark of a good game.

Looked intriguing; ended up hating it. With 4 players you can't possibly remember what's been played. Most of the time your strategy gets thwarted. Would have been better if only certain cards were hidden (a la Invisibility Cloak); as is, it's not much more than a guessing game. Also, worst English title ever.

Interesting and quick game. Has a real 'screw your neighbor' factor that can make obtaining goal cards an exercise in frustration. The most common gotcha is losing high value cards to special ability cards. There's fair bit of randomness as you play from your own deck of 25 cards but only have three in hand at a time. You often end up wasting your best cards on crappy goal cards because you can only work with your draw of three.

RATING: 6.5
[ESP] Un entretenido juego cuya mayor gracia es que puede ser jugado hasta con 6 jugadores.
Los jugadores compiten por las cartas de premio en cada columna para lo cual colocan cartas ocultas en ellas. Una vez que alguien se coloca a continuación se revela la carta anterior y se lleva a cabo su efecto.
Basicamente hay que intenar tener la mayor influencia en la columna para lo cual hay que colocar cartas grandes pero teniendo en cuenta que el efecto de alguna carta lo puede cambiar todo. Debes adivinar lo que harán tus oponentes..
El único problema que le veo al juego es que su duración es algo larga para un jueguito de cartas... aunque eso es en una partida de 6 jugadores.

I like the theme, the different cards, the planning on how to grab a price, and the suspense - what are those hidden cards from the other players, and how are they going to influence the outcome?

In the end, however, it is a pretty random, chaotic game, not a skill game. I'd categorize it as "long filler"

RATING: 8
This is a really well-designed card game.  I love the way that the special abilities of the different roles interact with one another.  I found myself constantly puzzled with lots of tough decisions to make on every turn.  But, thankfully, you only have 3 cards in your hand at any given time so analysis-paralysis doesn't really set in.  I'm really anxious to play this one again, which is always a good sign.

The one drawback to the game is the special abilities written on the cards.  Often the wording is very hazy, so it can be confusing and a player will need to reference the rulebook for clarification.  It seems like a game in desperate need of a player aid that each player can reference at any time for clarification of the powers of their cards.  Still it's a cool game if you can get past that.

A very "Faiduttian" style card game where each player gets a deck of characters with special powers.

Luck heavy & chaotic (from both the draw deck and game mechanics).  Some room for strategic play, but very much of the game is played on random guesses or best guesses.  Our 4p game was chaotic enough, it's hard to imagine playing with 6p.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one 2-player and one 3-player game. I see it having good potential as a 6-player filler game, something our growing game group can use. Nicely themed. In a 2-player game we found it very easy to keep track of what cards the opponent had played, but still overall quite enjoyable. Perhaps I wouldn't find it as unique if we had Citadels, or if we had played Colossal Arena (which we do have), but the potential 6-player aspect still makes it more useful our purposes. Only time will tell if it sees much play.

A very interesting character power game.  Has a similar feel to Laget and Faidutti's Castle.

A typical "Faiduttian" game, based on a very simple gameplay. Luck plays a major role in the game and it is almost impossible to build solid strategies, as some cards are symply too much powerful than others. It should need some more balancing: for instance, the muskeeteers are way too much powerful and even stop the prince-squire combo. Works well in 5. Very BAD english translation on cards: refer to the manual instead.

The gameplay is too chaotic, and the card drawing is way too random.  This game is just a mess.  Chaos is fine if the game is fun and short.  It's neither.  The only fun part about the game is the assasin card.  The wizard and witch are supposed to add fun "take that" elements to the game, but fall flat because there are so many rules to remember for dealing with them effectively.  The worst part is that there is only one of each card in the deck of 30, each with its own rules.  The rules on the cards intermingle and contradict each other so badly that only the rulebook will save you.  Also there are only 2 combos in the game that require two specific single cards.  It is nearly impossible to get those 2 cards together in a hand of 3.  In a game of five players, we only saw one of these combos ever occur.  Why not instead have multiples of certain cards, or have non-specific combos with less power?

Overall, I would just say that there is no strategy, and not even any interesting tactical mechanisms in this game.  Stay away.

RATING: 5
If you don't take this game too seriously, then it is good filler material which I would prefer over a game of Machiavelli (Citadels). This game scratches the same itch, but actually ends at some point, without seeing the same tired and tried strategies popping up all over the place. Luck of the draw is quite prominent and forces you to place cards you don't want to place; and in many cases finding out a closed card is quite a nasty one becomes a bit of an annoyance. You win some, you lose some. If you take this game too seriously, you do so at your own peril, for it will completely come apart at the seams. Don't&mdash;just switch off your brain for the most part, and enjoy the ride.

What [i]is[/i] annoying is the various rules issues. Can you use the Traitor on a column which has been closed by the Storm? Do Wizard and Witch influence the Little Giant? What is the correct working of the Hermit (as in the Dutch edition, there's a misprint on the card)? Games with cards with special powers nearly always have such issues, and it is very annoying that no rule space is devoted to some guideline or tie-braker.

RATING: 6
I think there are hints of a great game here.  The mechanics are new (to me) and clever.  Put down your hidden investment, but know that it's only going to be a mystery for so long.

The issue comes with the random factor - predicting the behavior of other players.  We played with 5 and it was nearly impossible to guess if your investment was going to be worth anything by the time you had another turn.

Although I haven't played it with 2 or 3 players yet, I suspect it will do much better in that format, as you'll be able to do a somewhat better job at prediction, and can strike back with immediacy.

A játékoksok pontot érő lapkákra pályáznak. A megszerzéshez különböző erősségű kártyákat tesznek le a pontok alá. Akinek több erősebb emberi vannak a pontot érő lap alatt a kör végén az viszi a lapot. Igenám, de némelyik lapnak van képessége is az erején kívül. Ezek a képességek teljesen boríthatják sorrendet (pl.: a leggyengébb viszi a pontot a legerősebb helyett). Ha ez nem lenne elég, akkor még egy érdekes mechanizmus visz egy nagy adag mulatságot a játékba. A frissen lerakott lapok mindig titkosak. Csak akkor fordulnak meg, ha alájuk újabb lap kerül. Ez teszi nem teljesen tervezhetővé a dolgokat.
Jópofa, szerencse alapú party-játék. Mi csak hármasban próbáltuk, valószínűleg többen még változatosabb és mulatségosabb. Fillernek, nongamer party-játéknak tökéletes.

Perhaps I play this with too many players. Maybe with 2 or 3 it is better but I'm not going to make the effort ot find out.

Rather complex rules cannot hide the fact that with more than 2 players, the outcome of the game is almost completely random. There is about as much strategy as in "Rock, Paper & Scissors". I'd almost say this game is broken and unplayable.

Looks really neat, but ends up being completely random with "gotcha" elements. It sours me not only on itself, but on the concept of gaming in general. After other bad games I'll look for something else to play; after this game I'm done playing for the evening.

This felt somewhat like a mix of "Castle" and "Colossal Arena", with heavy leanings toward the Faidutti-style chaos of the former.  However, the result fell far short of either of those.  We played two 3P games, and none of us were terribly impressed.  Often the rounds slipped by all too quickly.  With more players there would be more columns to fight over but also more opponent cards played between your turns, which, I expect, would be more interesting and more chaotic.  With 3P, we had one game in which one card type only appeared just once.  It could be better if some or all of the upcoming reward cards were known, but the game did not seem worth the effort to tinker.

Mildly amusing, light-medium weight game.  My score is only based off a 2-player game and I suspect the game is better with 3-5, due to the types of cards.  Additionally, I think a 2-player game of this probably ought to have a slightly larger hand of 4 instead of 3.

I have hard to evaluate this from the first go. At some point I think this is a good filler when your brain needs some rest. Not that there aren’t strategy, but that you shouldn’t over think your decisions. The problem I have with it is the inherent complexity of the game, which makes it hard to introduce to other players.

I played with 5 players and I think it worked fine that way.

When [i]Chinese Wall[/i] meets [i]Citadels[/i]. Not a game for serious planning but for good (chaotic) fun. Easier to teach to newbies than Citadels because player order is not variable. I like it as a filler and even with 6 players there is not much downtime. I play with the following [u]mod:[/u] The betrayer / Verraeter (the one who switches goal cards) is replaced by a governor / Statthalter that has 4 points for each row the player is present. If he is present in 3 rows by the valuation he's 12 points worth. This removes a little chaos, as I don't like the switch of the goal cards as planning is already almost impossible.

One of my favorite card games, it's very hectic and full of glorious and agonizing twists. I have no problem playing 3 or 4 times in a row, the games go quickly and they're full of drama and suspense. Scales incredibly well with 2-4 (I haven't played with more yet). Ruse has a great scoring system and combined with the fantastic special ability cards, I can see myself playing this game for a long time to come.

Another game that just seemed like I'd played it before. I know I haven't, but my point is that it just felt like a re-tread of old ideas. It isn't a bad game; in fact, I guess it's probably a pretty good game. It just wasn't for me. UPDATE- played again with full 6 players. I still didn't care for it, so the rating won't change. However, I actually had more fun this time, despite being royally hosed by actions aimed at other players. It was frustrating, but fun.

I'll need a few more plays of this before I can really lock in a rating.  As it stands now, the game is pretty much like Citadels put thru a blender.  I like the backstabbing and bluffing, but the fact that the order of card power resolution is not clearly explained in the rules bothers me.  I also dislike how many combinations of card interaction are without description, leaving room for a lot of interpretation (i.e. bring on the rules lawyers).  With some more pinning down and a fun group, this could be a real winner.  Here's hoping.

Interesting mechanics in this game that remind me of Hera & Zeus in that the cards are placed face down, with unknown effects.  It ends up working out to be pretty interesting, and I would imagine it would get more fun as you knew the cards better and players played quickly.  Still, even with experienced players, it seems like a little long for what it is, because there seems to be very little control.

A bidding game where players attempt to complete sets to win. I would liken this to a multiplayer BattleLine or King Arthur TCG. Its fun, fairly easy to learn and very enjoyable. Turns pass pretty quickly, so there isn't much downtime.

Super chaotic game with plenty of weird design decisions and a bit too lengthy playing time. Manages to still be kinda fun if you don't take it too seriously and are willing to house rule many of the complications that arise from card combinations not mentioned in the rulebook.

I have to deduct a point for poor usability: different card effects happen in different phases and in a certain order, none of which is shown on the cards.

It feels like a strange cross between Castel and Tomahawk.

Cool game. The randomness is reduced by keeping an eye on your opponents cards and memorizing which cards they already placed.

The premise isn't bad (if unoriginal): several characters with different special abilities are used to get points.

a fast-paced card game in the tradition of Citadels. Magicians and dragons, kings and princesses populate the land and want only one thing: the greatest fame.

Offer some bluff and good tactical choice and suspense since several characters have particular effects and nice combo.

Look chaotic but not really since you can notice which characters was played and adapt your strategy.

RATING: N/A
Each player gets their own deck of cards, with values numbered 1 to 20. On the table are goal cards arranged in a row, ranging in value from 1 to 5 in 6 different symbols. Players play their cards, face down, to form a column on goal cards. Another player may play a card below theirs on the same column, the card on top is then immediately revealed. Most cards have special abilities; e.g, the witch is worth 1 and discards all cards value 9 or higher; the assasin, a 9 1/2 card, discards the card beneath it when the assasin is revealed, Romeo and Juliet are worth 15 and 14 when played together, the squire and prince is an automatic win, the beggar makes the lowest value win the goal, and the three musketeers, a value 11 card cancels all special abilities. The round ends when all goal cards are filled up, the number of cards below a goal card equal to the value of the goal card. 
Play over a certain number of rounds. The players score is equal to the value of the goal cards they have attained, but if they have attained one of each suit , their score is doubled, and extraneous goal cards are subtracted. 

I have only played this once with 6 players, and it was fun, but there didn't seem to be a lot of control. Perhaps it plays a bit more strategic with less players. Initial rating of 6.5

File under "meaty filler" along with Citadels, To Court the King, Castle, and Fist of Dragonstones.  Chaotic, but not impervious to strategy.  Feels very Faidutti-ish.  Starts to wear out its welcome with six players.  Beware the incorrect text on the Rio Grande Assassin cards.

Nice card game, average art, light weight rules - 40 minutes including time to teach newbies. Box art and card illustrations desperately more charisma.
Players are dealt a small hand. Play then draw a single card. Cards are played face-down against one of several "goal" cards that are worth VPs. When each card is played, the previous card in that stack is revealed and its action triggered. Goals are completed when there are as many action cards as the VP value. End of the round when all the goal cards are complete - final face down cards all revealed but they don't trigger. Goals are won by the player who has greatest power ("influence") in the stack of cards. 6 rounds, high score wins. IIRC there was some odd set-collecting that influences scoring.
It was good, but traded because it never got played. I would get another copy if it were super cheap, or redone with decent art in a sensible size box.

Cool, quick, hand management game to outmaneuver your cards in columns for majority. The cards act like tiles, and are placed face-down, revealing the face-down card above it. Many cards also have special powers, which, with the artwork, are the spice of the game.

I like the artwork and feel of the gameplay. I wish this game was around decades ago.

Okay with 2 players; better with more. Rio2004's 2 player variant works very well.

At first I was put aback by the similarities to other games (especially citadels, but also to Court the King). But with time I came to enjoy this game more and more. Right now it's actually a good opener which my group has come to enjoy more and more.The uncertainty of the opponents' cards makes for great tention and many surprises! plays great with 2 and 3 players.

Nice not so quick but quite fullfilling gamingexperience! The game reminds me a little bit of "Colossal Arena": Just the flair, not the game mechanic!Update: Having played Castle by Faidutti, I must admit, that this game has more to do with Castle, than with Colossal Arena. Still this is a longer game, the others seem to be a little bit lighter and shorter. But this game plays better with more players whereas the others play better with fewer players. :)

You place cards to score the highest value in a column and thus win the point markers. Cards are placed face down (hidden) and only revealed when another card is placed below them, which also triggers their action. The main issue is that the timing and effect of the cards are not always clear especially when there are several that effect each other. You need to read the explanations in the rules to understand which card does what and even then it is not always clear so there may be debates. This leads to frustration as to how the cards effects take place will determine who wins the column and thus the points.

The material is light. The graphics on the cards are superb but the cards could have been bigger and of better quality (more rigide).
First impression of play: The game is light, fun,easy and plays rapidly. The cards are well explaned by the text on them so you don't have to memorize all the caracters. The mechanic is simple yet effective. A very good filler game. Can't wait to try it again.
Few multiple player games. Very fun and fast. But you have less control. Take that moves are frequent, so if you don't like to be bothered in your strategy, this game is not for you. 

Le matériel est léger. Le graphisme des cartes est superbe mais les cartes auraient pu être plus grosse et de meilleure qualitée (plus rigide).

Première impression: Le jeux est léger, plaisant, rapide et facile à jouer. Le texte sur les cartes expliques bien ces dernières ce qui évite de mémoriser tous les personnages. La mécanique est simple et efficace. Bon jeu pour combler un court laps de temps. Je suis impatient d'y rejouer.
Quelques parties à plusieurs joueurs. Ce jeu s'avère rapide et simple mais vous avez moins de contrôle. Possibilités fréquentes de faire des coups de type ''take that''. Ainsi, si vous n'aimez pas être déranger dans votre stratégie, ce jeu n'est pas pour vous.

Neat little game! There are many card powers to learn so the initial rules explanation takes a bit too long (the game needs a good player aid!). Still, the rules are pretty simple and the game flows along nicely. The card-reveal is clever and adds a bit of excitement every turn and keeps everyone interested. May be a bit too chaotic with too many players? With a hand of only 3 cards, there is more tactics than strategy. Still, the game plays quickly and these don't seem to be major issues (and easily 'fixable': play with 3-4 players and larger hand size, if you like!). 

Beware! The English translation on some of the cards is unclear (better explained in the rule book).

Rules:
Setup
- Shuffle the goal cards = cards worth 1-5VP, each with one of the 6 symbols printed on it. Deal 6 to each player (face down stack); the rest are removed from game.
- Each player gets their pile of influence cards. Shuffle into your own draw pile, and draw a hand of 3 cards.

Play
- Each round, players place their top goal card in the center of the table
- Starting with random player, play a card then draw a card.
- Cards are played face down in a column under any of the goal cards. When played, you flip over the face down card above it and execute its action (if any).
- Continue taking turns till all goal cards have at least as many cards below them as their VP value = End of Hand.

End of Hand
- Reveal all face down cards at the bottom (but don't execute their actions).
- Mercenaries, Wizards, Witches, and Princes/Squires execute their actions.
- Then each goal card is awarded to the player with the most influence below (= sum of their card values). Ties go to the player with the card highest in the column.

End of Game
- Play 6 rounds.
- Players score VP equal to the higher of: 
... sum of the values of all goal cards won
OR
... if you have a set of all 6 goal symbols, sum those 6 cards (highest VP per symbol) and double it. Then, subtract 1VP per goal card remaining (ignore VP value).
- Most VP wins. Several levels of tie breakers.

06-Nov-08: Reminds me a bit of Samurai. Players are trying to win different "suits" of cards worth various points. They do so by playing cards against those "suits". A nifty "last card played is hidden" mechanic adds some chaos into the mix. Played with 3 players, and was hosed by the fact that there were only 2 "swords" suit cards dealt out during the game, thus making me the odd one out without one. Perhaps the full complement of players will make this a more even (albiet, chaotic) game.

I had never heard of this one until someone brought it out at game night.  You each have a deck of characters with a point value and some sort of special ability.  Each round there are several columns, and the winner of each column (highest combined) wins a card that is worth various amounts of victory points.  Each turn you can play a character onto one of the columns to try and get that card.  The interesting thing is that you play your character face down, and it isn't revealed/activated until someone plays another character in the same column.  Some characters will kill others, or make it so the fewest points wins, or do other interactions.

It makes the game somewhat random and unpredictable, but it was pretty fun to play and it accommodates a large group.  Unique yet simple design that I would happily play again.

A semi-enjoyable, card-driven game of majority control that features some fascinating card powers and interactions. Can be painful and feel fiddly if some of the players have difficulty grasping the card powers and their effects on each other, but more often Ruse & Bruise moves along fairly quickly, presents some challenging choices to players and is some light fun. While there's room for clever play, the game is usually too chaotic to really reward good tactics. Scores also tend to have large swings ... don't look to this one for balance and close contests..

That said, it'll be hard to bring to the table. Hardcore Eurogamers will hate it. And for the typical Ameritrash crowd it might be a tad too mild concerning conflict.

A decent little fast-paced card game that accommodates up to six players reasonably well. The fact that you have an entire deck full of different cards with different abilities makes for a steeper learning curve than you'd normally want in such a light and quick game, but veteran gamers should be able to pick up the symbols and special abilities relatively quickly. It's ability to scale to accommodate various player counts and its speed are its assets, which may just overcome the shortcoming of its learning curve if you stick with it.

A really fun filler. My initial impression was of horror when I got a stack of personal cards for my own deck with descriptions of each power. Imagine my relief when I realized that players are expected to handle only three cards each time. Much more palatable. Funny how one mechanism to eliminate choice is enough to make me change my mind of the game.

The game itself breaks no new ground. In fact, there are plenty of other games that have the same area majority mechanism with special powers. For some reason, I really enjoyed the card play, synergy between cards and also hustling for points. One rule that made the difference for me is the ability to add more cards on a row that had already exceeded the point value of that row without triggering the end round. 

Game is actually more fun than the ratings or rankings would otherwise suggest

The ultimate example of the meatgrinder game. Throw stuff in, see what comes out. It's probably a huge mistake to play this with 6. The chaos is ramped up to 11, and on top of that it draaaaaaaaags.

An interesting variant might be to flip over everyone's draw pile so that they are drawn face-up. Everyone can see the next card each person will draw, so you have some idea of what might be coming down the line. The idea of keeping track of what cards have been played by each of 5 other players is ludicrous.

A wild card game of column control. Players try to win goal cards by playing their cards in the same column. Subsequent cards reveal the previous cards, which could cause some wild effects. Effects include trading goal cards, removing all cards above 10 in the column, winning the column if another card is present, etc. 

The game is somewhat complex for the amount of randomness it has. Fortunes can swing wildly due to 1 card. Also, there are two ways to score (two strategies) -- go for one of each kind or simply go for a lot of stuff.

Players are aristocrats competing for popularity by calling in favours wherever they can.  Everyone starts the game with the same 25 personality cards, one for each of the people close to the court.  The cards have different point values, and are placed to win little contests each round.  Whoever scores the most popularity points in these contests wins.  Many of the personality cards have special effects that only get activated when someone plays a card afterwards.  Very fun and fast to learn and play, this game is pretty chaotic.  There is not much strategy, but lots of room for sneaky play.  I especially like it with 4-6 players.

You have 3 cards to use each round. How they can work together is interesting. Fun for what it is.

Played once (with 4 players). A pleasant, if not great, game. The rules are quite clear, the cards are beautiful (and have less German text as expected), and the gameplay is enjoyable. Planning is not always easy, and I suspect that the game would be really chaotic with more than 4 players. Also, it is quite difficult to combine cards efficiently (Prinz/Knappe or Romeo/Julia) when you have only 3 out of 25 in your hand.

Fun game, but not something I'm always in the mood for. The art is nice.

Enjoyable with two players, becomes too chaotic with more. The interaction between the different special tiles makes the game harder than it should have been.

Nice filler. Plays very quickly, and is an easy one to explain to new players. Played well with two. Feels like it would be fun with more. Stored in small game box.

Clever and interesting, but horrible name.  I have a feeling it doesn't scale very well, either.  I've only played it with two and three, and two player is just not the greatest.  It probably should have been at 3-6, or maybe even 3-5 (not sure at this point).

A nice little game. Sadly it is a bit too chaotic and you always have to look up which effects occurs first. Without the rules at hand this game is almost unplayable. You can't ask because then you would reveal your card so every now and then a player has to look up a card.
Besides that it's really a good game - maybe one of those were less would've been more.

RATING: 6.5
Riddled with typos and ackward wording, but very interactive and thematic. The main mechanic of revealing previously placed cards makes for tense and fun "aha!" moments.

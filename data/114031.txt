RATING: 7
Most games these days “borrow” mechanics from others. This is understandable because it is hard to come up with something new all the time and even the games that could be described as innovative usually have some aspects that have been done elsewhere. Copycat, however, takes things to a new level with every aspect of it quite blatantly purloined from other games. There is no attempt to conceal this. It’s almost like Friese has stolen a bland theme as well because there basically isn’t one. However, given the pedigree of the list hes stolen from (and, of course, Friese himself), it is perhaps no surprise that it all work pretty well. As such the game is very ‘pleasant’ to play. It moves well, builds to a climax and there can be a lot of tension around getting the actions and cards that you want.

RATING: 6
It's a kind of dominion, but without the interesting cards, only money and victory point card and "draw more cards" in the deck (and a few more).
Combined with some worker placement on the board, to get some extra money or victory points each round. 
As with most copies of good things, it's not as good as the original(s). Not really bad either.

RATING: 6.5
When I read about this game in development I was excited. When I read the rules, I expected another Dominion clone with none of the charm of Agricola. Having played the game, I'm excited again. This is a fun, funny, clever, new take on the modern and the popular titles, and far more than the gimmick it might appear to some.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting mashup of mechanics from various games.  Most aspects of the game work well together and the familiarity of the mechanisms make the game very easy to grasp for seasoned gamers.  However, I do wonder how many viable strategies the game has.  In my two plays, the best strategy seems to be to buy a few high victory point cards and then double them through actions on the board.

Additionally, there seems to be an odd design issue where some of the biggest and strongest cards that become available for purchase late in the game will never get used because the game ends on a round count before those cards are drawn to be played, or even before they can be bought.

When this game got announced I was fascinated and interested very fast. I was aware of the fact that the game might not be the greatest but wanted it for my collection anyway because of the fine sense of humor Friedemann Friese has. As I got to play it, my expactations were fullfilled. The game is more some piece of "gaming art", some kind of homage to great boardgames and a very satirical view on (espacially german) politics nowadays. If you take it as the last mentioned, you will have fun. As a boardgame itself its simply not shining enough.

This game took some of the most exciting parts of popular games and made something uniquely...moderate.  It definitely has its charms: the art, the polished design with multiple victory paths and end conditions.  It just didn't feel cohesive.  I wanted to like it more, but it won't hit the table again before...well, lots of FF's other games.

RATING: 4
I really wanted to like this.  Honestly, you have no idea how much I wanted to like this game.  Frankenstein's [-]Monster[/-] [i]Game[/i] using pieces of games I mostly like and enjoy!  AWESOME!

And then I played it.  And I wondered what the heck happened to the endgame.  And I lamented.  And I cried.  And I played it again.  And a friend of mine broke the game by buying the "right" cards.  And there was no alternative and no way to combat this.  And I lamented.  And I cried.  And I put this back on my shelf and wished I hadn't bought it.

There is no endgame.  The endgame is BUY THE DOCTORATES IF YOU CAN.  And if you can't?  TOO BAD!  And if it comes to you and the doctorate doesn't do much for you anyways?  BUY IT BECAUSE THE OTHER PLAYER(S) CAN USE IT SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAT YOU WILL CRY IF YOU LET THEM HAVE IT.  etc.

By now, I forget the specifics of how my friend broke the game.  I think it was him going into the VP cards early enough to use them a lot and then him buying more of them because he could/they came up at the right time for him.  I know we couldn't stop him and he absolutely trounced us.  Like back alley beating trounced us.  We were wincing.  And for me that was the nail in the coffin.

Rated as high as it is (currently a 4) because I still want to play it again and see where it goes wrong.  It'd be like requesting a root canal, but I still want to.  I just so badly want to like this one!!!  But I won't.  And I want to perform more autopsies to see why.  *sigh*

The whole game fell apart for me.  I so wanted to like it!  Now I just want to trade/sell it away.  Ah well.

RATING: 4
This game takes elements of TTA, Agricola, Dominion, and I don't know what else, and throws them into a melting pot. The result was mediocre. The actions to take seemed standard fare, and the game tries to do too many things. 

Also, some of the combos seem either like they're broken, or like we played them wrong. From what we could tell in the rules, that wasn't the case, but who knows.

Played in the Rio Grande room @ Gen Con 2014. Was very excited about the 'copycatted' mechanics initially (pulling from dominion, agricola, and TTA!), but the doubling mechanic feels very overpowered and whoever gets the most powerfully doubled cards first seems like they are going to steamroll everyone. Could change with multiple plays, but not sure if I want to actually pick this one up or not. 7 for now.

RATING: 6
No way that an assemblage of mechanisms from very popular games was bound to be successful.  So credit to Friedeman Friese for assembling parts of Dominion, Agricola and Through the Ages to make a game that works perfectly well.  The dominant flavour to me was Dominion; you'll find yourself trying deckbuilding tricks you learned from that game.  The trouble for me is that I don't find deckbuilding very engaging and Copycat would need to be more than a competent re-implementation of it to change my opinion.

The artwork is quite pleasing with lots of humourous touches.  Production quality is good.  As has recently been the case with Rio Grande, the rules could have been clearer.

A nicely put together game, but far too much randomness (probably the deck construction part) for my liking. Bad card draws limited the game in what you could do, deck recycling, buying cards which gave extra actions did nothing. Would probably play again to get a fairer rating.

The game flows due to its borrowed well-tested mechanisms, but it doesn't have the soul of a game like Agricola even though it borrows elements from "the Gric". It feels mostly dominionish.

A mix of everything that doesn't work very well for me, at least not after one game.  A little too much Agricola, and the deck-building didn't seem to fit very well for me.

RATING: 7
Felvállaltan (sőt már-már hivalkodóan) más játékokból ollózott elemeket használ fel. Gyakorlatilag 30% Agricola (worker placement rész egy az egyben onnan lett átvéve) + 30% Dominion (pakliépítés) + 30% Through the ages (kártyavásárlás) + 10% új (korábbiak öszegyúrása). Bár a legtöbb játék rég bevált dolgokból építkezik, azért ennyire nyilvánvalóan nem nagyon szoktak más szerzők játékaiból ollózni, de itt épp ez a cél! És ami meglepett, hogy egész jól működik a dolog. A sorrendért történő licit azt hiszem nem lopott, és nekem egészen tetszett. Kicsit lehetne rövidebb a játék, de egyébként jól elvoltunk vele, bár nem kiugró... Kicsit pofátlanságnak érzem, hogy tematikát egyáltalán nem is próbált belevinni a szerző, ez tényleg csak közkedvelt mechanizmusok összegyúrása. Nem szándékosan, de a pontszám amit adtam rá, épp megegyezik a 3 ötletadó játék pontszámának átlagával, ez a jövőben szerintem inkább lefelé mozoghat, mint felfelé.

A meta-themed game. Excellent theme/idea, the sarcastic plagiarism! kudos sir! I was actually waiting for a renowned designer to troll this subject :D

as for the mechanics:
the game feels like "dominion the boardgame"
without the different setups.

the through the ages card row copy works Perfectly.
the worker placement thing also works very good!
the agricola stage by stage action works ok.
the dominion thing...well I'd like 2 or 3 more special actions to call it perfect.

I think they all tie in very well together, which made me enjoy the game much. Have no idea about its balance or depth, particularly I'm worried for the 1-2 last rounds. Have to play many times to judge that.

overall, I enjoyed it. waiting to see if there is strategy after the excitement.

I am far away from being the greatest fan of Mr. Friese. Power Grid is very good but I am not enamored with it, and the other games designed by the man with green hair left me very cold (I enjoyed just Friday).
So I bought Fremde Federn on a whim, because I was intrigued by the idea of a Frankestein game made stitching together parts of many games I enjoy...
I must admit I am pleasantly surprised by my first couple of plays: the game is easy to learn (well, at least if you played the hell out from its 'parents'), plays smoothly and someway feels a little different and superior to the sum of its parts.
I doubt it can have a great longevity: the number of cards is quite small, and after a handful of plays every possible strategy will be probably explored, but only time will tell...

You've read the blurb about the games from which Friedemann drew inspiration.  Heck, most of the other comments mention them as well.  I like the baldfaced audacity of blatantly stating "I'm copying," and love the fact that the other designers allowed it.  I don't fault the creative process this game followed at all.

But a bit like Frankenstein's monster animated by mechanical means, this game lacks a soul.

Deck building and worker placement go great together! I really like this game. The line of cards to buy makes each purchase a super strategic decision. Am I leaving something good for the next player? The worker placement part of the game is interesting as well. My then 14 year old only used his workers for the VP tokens for one entire game and finished in 2nd by only 2 points. Keeper.

A game that is a melting pot of mechanics from other games, and the result is one of the most interesting deck-building games to date.  It's quirky and experienced players probably have an advantage, but it's a fun ride even for newbies.  Familiarity with the composition of the stacked/sequenced 5-stage draw deck is helpful (e.g., value 2 and 3 money cards are only available for the beginning 1/3 of the game).

I like the cartoony style of the board and cards, very cute and works well with the theme. Interesting concept to mix aspects of different popular games. Letdown for me was the Dominion deck-building mechanic is overly prominent - I like Dominion but am getting a little tired of the mechanic as used in countless other games. A small, tightly-controlled deck is the key to success, along with use of the very powerful doubling actions. I wanted to like this one, but it just didn't do it for me in the end.

Played this once at the 2013 WBCs, and enjoyed it very much.  I am a wargamer who only dabbles with Euros (with the exception of Dominion which I play excessively), but I'd definitely sit down to another game of this given the chance.  It seemed like there were a variety of choices and strategies to pursue, but only repeated play will reveal if that is true.

I like the mix of deckbuilding and worker placement. The theme isn't bad either even if it's not attached to the game very strongly. But based on one play the impression I got was that the game could have a runaway leader problem where the last place struggles to keep the pace to be able to purchase anything useful. The game felt very short for a deckbuilder.

 not a bad game. all of the mechanics are familiar. Deck building for the purpose of buying cards and gaining VPs. Worker placement and card placement for more workers, cash, VPs, and card draws. Innocuous game that I'd play again but won't ask for.

Update - March 6th 2013:
Talk about a bad rulebook... Trying to learn the game I read the rules 3 times before we decided to just dive in and try it. The rules make it sound like an overly complicated game where in actuality it's quite simple and intuitive. The game is fun and I enjoyed playing it. The rulebook is terrible and I hated learning it. If it wasn't for the rulebook I would rank this higher.

Friese is known for his heavier, mathier games, and I was expecting the same here: Friedemann Friese combined Through the Ages, Agricola, and Dominion? It's gonna be a beast!

Well, it's not. It's actually a simple, short, fun little game. Although it steals mechanics from heavier games, it takes all of the stress and tension out of them and becomes a light, easygoing, almost gateway-level game. The humorous theme contributes to this feeling because you aren't supposed to care about your lazy office workers with their worthless degrees. Overall, the game is fun, but not groundbreaking. I suspect the designer agrees with me!

Playing Copycat after a long break, I have to revise my opinion back upwards. We played it a bunch in a short period back when it came out, and I can see the replay value isn’t totally awesome. But it does a lot of stuff right, and I think it has more range than I gave it credit for. The combo of worker placement and deck building is surprisingly inspired and significantly mitigates the major inherent weaknesses in both genres. You have to play both sides; focusing on it as primarily a deckbuilder is to miss half the game. Anyway, the replayability is obviously not infinite here, but it was a very pleasant surprise to revisit.
—
I fear Copycat has been felled. I really enjoyed it for maybe as many as 5-7 plays (my play records here appear incomplete), but the last time around one player got a disproportionate share of the card-drawing action cards and crushed everyone in a decidedly un-fun manner. If the game is going to break if the split on those cards is bad, that's not good. I always knew they were strong, but I didn't think they would dominate to the serious degree they seem to. I wouldn't mind playing again, but most people I play with don't seem to have enthusiasm for the game anymore, and I'm not going to push it. Too bad. Very, very close, But I don't think this is quite there.

I'm thinking I'm going to like this one but the first game took longer than it should as there seemed to be too much for some people to choose from to get the optimum performance out of their deck and sucked a bit of the fun out of it. Hoping when I play a second time it won't take so long. I love the idea though. 2 Plays. Campaign Workers seem a must have as do the blue cards. Rules are awfully translated and I have ended up with one of the first 200 misprinted versions of the rules as well.

The humour on the cards keeps me smirking throughout, and I keep looking for the different ways I can get to my end goal of winning this game, even once! Don't be a hater... great game. It will never surpass Power Grid, but I found the perfect game in Power Grid, so I never expect anything to do so. If something does then it will truly surprise me to a level of major level of happiness.

So it's Dominion + Agricola + Through the Ages and it all really works.  I like how you score  your point cards every round, nuding up your score track.  My big complaint is that it really feels like you don't build a big enough engine, as the point spaces are the best spaces past the mid point of the game and your hand doesn't seem to get as powerful as the board does, considering most of what you do in the game is configure your deck.

Hard to rate, since it's not quite clear if the designer was actually trying to design a good game, or if the whole thing is a cynical commentary on euros and the eurogamers who play them.

As the title implies, it's a mish-mash of mechanics from other euro games, but there's nothing inspiring here. Whether or not that was the point I can't say, but I'm in no hurry to play it again.

Players are candidates for public office, trying to get elected.  Players on their turn draw five cards from their private deck, and play one to determine turn order for the current turn.  Then players alternate placing meeples, Agricola style, onto the game board to take actions/money.  Actions involve draw cards, buying cards, trashing cards, and so on.  Finally players then score any victory points earned this turn, and the game moves on.  Basically, as advertised, this is a blend of Agricola, Through The Ages, Puerto Rico and Dominion.  It works fine, but gives the impression it could be solved quite easily.  Fun romp though.

This is a nice design that does justice to its BGG top 10 mashup premise. Would I like to play it again?  Sure!  Would I like to play it ten more times? Ehhhhh.....

I think my difficulty with this game is that the design is workmanlike rather than truly inspired. I think for me it falls into that category of Euros where I'd be very glad to play it, but I don't see it having a enough replayability to earn a spot on my shelves.

It's a copycat (wink) of Dominion and Agricola. Very interesting calculations and decisions to make but the lack of interaction and variety makes me doubt its replayability. Very abstract and does not feel like you're running a political campaign (about as dry as Dominion). Also, some moves seem too obvious to make. and you can get a massive score jump at the end if you have the money-multiplier card. Still, it definitely has at least a few more plays in it for me.

2019-09-30 : First play. I wasn't expecting much - miss-mash games rarely are any good - so I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It has very clear graphics and iconography and flows really well. Multiple strategies got explored and the discussion afterwards turned to what everyone would do in a subsequent game - always a a good sign. The only negative for this simple and elegant game is the rulebook, which is a confusing mess. Initial rating of 6 which might hold or might go up on subsequent plays.

Fine balanced unforgiving game. As usual for a pure Friedemann game: no heavy theme almost like a Knizia. But mechanicly he use to make very solid games.

Played once.  A good amalgamation of several good game mechanics, with the usual amusing Fredemann Friese wit and charm.

Friedemann Friese has the ability to amaze his fans by solving seemingly impossible design challenges.  This game, which "steals" elements from Agricola, Dominion and Through the Ages (hence the title, which as I understand it means "False Feathers", a German idiom for taking ideas from others to create ones own work) is something you wouldn't have thought possible, but there it is.  I think I might like it more than Dominion, a game I am only mildly fond of.

Why do you set out to make a game by copying mechanisms from various other games? The only sensible answer I can think of would be along the lines of "to distill the best parts of those games and create something even better," at least for someone with his game designer hat on because there is no doubt that this game is intended as a form of social commentary as well.

As a game, however, Copycat is a disappointment. Taking parts from some of the best games and trying to improve on them is a tall order to start with, and Copycat is not very successful in creating something that doesn't feel just as derivative as you might expect. Its involuntary parents are readily recognizable and the game certainly works but apart from the initial idea (and perhaps more true to it than intended) and even in combination there is nothing new, exciting, or different. It is hard to argue that there has been an improvement of any kind. This game certainly proves that simply copying mechanisms from good games does not in itself another good game make.

plays buttery smooth.  The mechanics work great together, not just a gimmick, and if you like how Dominion and Agricola play, you'll like how this game hangs together.

Der Name ist die Idee: FREMDE FEDERN ist eine absichtliche, offene und offensive, sich ironisch schmückende Zitatsammlung aus den beliebtesten Mechanismen der Vielspielerwelt von AGRICOLA bis DOMINION, thematisch passend eingebettet in die Welt der korrupten Polit-Szene provinzieller deutscher Spießigkeit. Das ist witzig und spielt sich fluffig, aber FREMDE FEDERN kommt dabei nicht über die Originale hinaus. Der Versuch der Verdichtung wird weniger als die einzelnen Teile. Beim im Zentrum stehenden Deckbau hatte ich zudem das Gefühl, das die einzige sichere Möglichkeit den Verlauf zu steuern, ein konsequent entschlacktes Deck ist, innerhalb dessen sich die Engine-Varianz jedoch in Grenzen hält. FREMDE FEDERN ist in seiner Grundidee der Vorbote von 504. Humor und Ironie sind prima Stilmittel, aber sie sollten dem Original, das sie augenzwinkernd kopieren, schon ebenbürtig sein. Das grässliche Artwork von Harald Lieske vervollständigt meinen eher durchschnittlichen Eindruck.

Fun, although I worry about replayability long term.  Does a nice job of mashing together several games.  Friese says it also includes elements of Puerto Rico and Power Grid, although I fail to see where (that's not necessarily a bad thing).  Definitely can see the Dominion and Agricola in the game.  The card purchase mechanic seems to be more Ascension than Through the Ages.  My wife really likes this so I suspect that it might be a nice gateway game.

I like how the game works, but the card effects get boring fast. Most cards are simple upgrades of cheaper ones, instead of having a nice unique effect that could make the game more interesting.

It's mostly about the right timing, when to start to accumulate points and stop buying cards. Using the deckbuilding mechanic there's some luck in the draw, too.

All in all a nice game, but one that could've been better.

Copycat takes the best bits of the Dominion base mechanics, then adds the pacing of Agricola and the card buying of Through the Ages to make a cracking election-themed board game. After 10+ plays, scrub any doubts about longevity; I'm still loving it.

RATING: 4
Mash up of Dominion, Agricola, other bits and an auction component. I appreciate the effort, but this really falls flat with me. Others I know like this, and that's fine, but I will never suggest this one. 

First, I never understood why euros are fixated on auctions. Ra makes it fun, but I hate most auction games. You get 5 cards per round, and you are forced to use one to auction off turn order. Not a fan.

It's worker placement to do actions, and that's not bad, but it also feels like the parts of Agricola I don't like (and I do like Agricola), where you feel like you're not getting a whole lot done each turn. I'll give the game credit in that it forces hard decisions at times, but that's not enough to save it.

My biggest problem is the randomness. I love all things random, but if the game is close at the end, and one of the four closing cards is going to decide the game, then whoever has the highest card number for turn order action gets first pick and wins. Not good. I've heard of this happening in other groups. Last time I played I was in last, and had I been able to draw the card at the top of my deck, I would have vaulted into first. Not sure I like that.

Lastly, I am not a fan of the art. While 	
Friedemann is a decent looking chap, I don't need to see him on many of the cards so prominently. It's nothing personal, just seems a tad egocentric.

So if you like this one, good for you. Not one I enjoy.

It's pretty funny how the title invites players to look for similarities between this game and others, suggesting even that this is a shameless ripoff of those other games, when in fact, although it may borrow many mechanisms, it plays very differently from any of them.  It's hard to point at exactly why, but I guess if I were going to claim that a game can be more than the sum of its parts, this would be an appropriate game to use for that? Heh.  It's light, engaging, and makes a good filler for gamers who are familiar with the other games and will be amused by the mechanical references.  (1 play)

Straight hybrid of worker placement "agricola-feeling" with deck-building. Easy to catch and play.

It seems that at the game end purchases are most of the time useless and a bit risky (they may never end up in your hand). Maybe if the cards would have a facial value for the game-end, some more possibilities could be delivered to it. And a surprise on the scoring track would be a plus too. =)

Steals mechanics of Agricola, Through the Ages, & ???.  Worker placement resource gathering game that lampoons politics.

Lacks a bit of polish, but is reasonably quick and humourous.

Oh dear, although it might be a clever mish-mash of mechanics stolen....err.... borrowed from other games which is meant to be a "gaming joke", including the deliberate error on the scoring track, themed on German politics, the whole thing is far short of the sum of its parts.

I think it just goes to show that FF has burnt-out and unable to come up with anything new and a theme so thin that it makes Dr Knizia's theme's seem fully formed!

Played as a quick, light, filler game it is probably a bit of fun. It succeeds on being light and unsubstantial, but quick? No way - our game also went on for about an hour too long for the experience/enjoyment that the game is capable of providing.

All in all, a dreadful gaming experience - an unfunny and uninspired "jest".

Love Friedemann, but was skeptical when I read about the concept.  However, I LOVED my first play of this.

My only hesitation is that if you take a couple of hard knocks in turns 2-5, you're basically out of the game.  (This happened to me.  I couldn't even afford to buy cards for the entire last third of the game.)  In Dominion, no big deal - but my first game of this clocked in at almost two hours.  

Even scrapping and scrounging to mini-max the options available to me was fun, and I could tell the decisions my opponents were making were frequent and meaningful.  This has skyrocketed to the top of my "need to play again, but screw it, I'll probably buy it soon anyways" list.

RATING: 8
While its Dominion influence clearly shows, Copycat actually reminds me most of a title that the designer doesn't mention: Saint Petersburg. Like that classic, the path to victory is pretty straightforward: build an engine that allows powerful moves and find the right time to start cashing it out for points. It is a Euro game on the surface, but a tactical points race at heart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a really cool idea, and I'm impressed that Friedemann turned the idea into a playable game.  Halfway through my first game, another first-time player said, "I like it."  I hadn't formed an opinion yet, because it seemed like the end-game would play a big part in the game experience.  After the game was over (and I won), I still couldn't decide how I felt about the game.  The result seemed to go my way because of good luck on my part and bad luck on the part of the second place player.  It's not a super-heavy game so that's not a deal-breaker, but it does give me pause.  So, mark me down as still undecided.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For an intentionally designed mashup of three excellent games, you'd think it might share some of the challenge and fun of those other titles, but instead Copycat manages to remove all sharp edges and paints everything with a heavy layer of bland. Players both place workers a la Agricola AND play cards from their hand a la Dominion. Cards are usually played when the workers are placed or during the "buy and score points" phase afterward. After the buys, the cards move forward via the Through The Ages type conveyor belt. Rinse and repeat until a player hits 95 points, 11 turns have passed, or the last cards are bought.

Much like in Dominion, you need to start your money engine early and gear up your point engine late. The problem here is that the game pretty much forces you down that path with money cards for purchase drying up about mid-game. If you missed out on the early cards, there isn't a lot you can do to make it up since later cards often only multiply the effect of the cards you already have. Also, unlike Dominion, you have to play point cards to get the points, you don't get points for simply having them in your deck. This makes that last couple of turns feel pretty wonky. You want to buy point cards, but they are not likely to get played, so the last turns are about finding something, anything useful you might be able to do, which really makes the game peter out rather than finishing with a bang. I don't see any reason to revisit this.

Played about 8-10 times, mostly in the first four or five months after the game came out.  As the name implies, it borrows heavily from elements of other games but it seems to work.  Could have a runaway leader problem.  No real desire to play it much these days, however.

This game is just okay. It's nothing special. I don't typically like deck builders very much so that's definitely shading my opinion.

All the 'stolen' bits work well together, FF did a good job. But it's pretty simplistic in terms of strategy and I found myself getting board with the long play time (3 players took about 1.5 hours). I wouldn't usually consider that long, but when you're bored and the game is dragging and you... just... want.... it........... to.............. END!!

Yes, it is Dominion. And Agricola. And Through the Ages. A bit of Puerto Rico. In this order. Foremost, it's a deckbuilder. Everything else is an add-on. I like the Agricola part best but standard deckbuilding strategies like deck-thinning, building up purchasing power and finally a VP engine are key to winning. The whole is the sum of the parts, not more.

As someone who likes to explain games to others with "It's like Dominion, but..." Copycat is right in my wheelhouse. Friedman Friesse takes a variety of familiar mechanics from different games, and somehow makes them a new game. It's exciting and different.

RATING: 6
I don't know what's wrong with me but the theme and artwork isn't as amusing to me as I think it's supposed to be. It is interesting how these famous mechanisms mesh together into a more or less convincing whole, though I'm not sure that it's fun enough to keep going back to. The relatively narrow range of cards in the deck means that most times would feel pretty much the same. There are some pretty overpowered card combinations that must be cool to pull off, but all in all I just don't feel a desire to play Copycat after having played a couple times. This has happened with the last few big box 2F games I've played.

RATING: 8
I am not a real big fan of either Dominion or Agricola, but when F.F. combined them into this game they became something I think I will always enjoy.  
This is very much a worker placement game. You place workers to get the cards required to build a VP engine.

RATING: 5
Copycat sets out to merge maybe 50% Dominion, 15% Agricola and a smidgen of Through the Ages, with the remainder being none-too-astounding stuff to bridge the gaps. The game does at least succeed in proving the project was feasible, but beyond that? Confronted with the deck building process of Dominion, the worker placement process of Agricola assumes a position of submission and servitude. Perhaps inevitably it is not the case that the genes inherited from the parent games are exclusively good ones. The issue of wasted turns (where in spite of your best efforts you fall 1 money short of doing anything at all) piles insult onto injury when those turns have the ceremony of Agricola and not the brevity of Dominion. Of the direct player interaction in Through the Ages, Copycat inherits nothing, and even the indirect blocking of Agricola shows up only as an indistinct shadow. The ambience is eminently dreary, built around a visual reference that already feels dated; I would prefer even the stuffy fantasy of Mage Knight to... to this... OK, it doesn't even really help to know what it's about. There are these spaces that spit out money and victory points.

There's a lot of cool stuff going on in this game. Supposedly, it's a "copycat" of existing, popular board games. But since most games copy *some* elements from other games, it's really not that noticeable. The gameplay offers plenty of depth and replayability.

Themeless. Reminds me of Agricola + Dominion. I like all of the working parts of this game, with the deck building and worker placement aspects that seem to mesh well than I thought they would, but the game becomes too clunky with the multiplicative effects of certain cards. Overall I'm left feeling like I'd rather just play a pure worker placement game or a pure deckbuilder.

Dominion (deck building) + Agricola (worker placement). Elements from Puerto Rico (bonus for the roles that are not selected in the previous round), Through the Ages (card prices), and something that I cannot recall (turn order auction). I think it integrates all those elements quite well. In addition, I like its parodic wit very much: Bush and Merkel, Sarkozy and Gaddafi, Putin's vacation, etc. But, to my disappointment, the game becomes a bit weird particularly in the last phase.

Good game. Dominion style of play with other well known mechanics included. This time the mix works very well and game flow is excellent IF you've fast game group. There is a possibility to some AP and in those cases the experience isn't that good. But anyway one of the best games released in Essen 2012.
Updated 10/2013: more you play it, it comes more and more repetitive because of the same deck of cards in every game. It isn't still bad game, but if you compare this to Trains (which have different kind of card set every game), Copycat just don't make it. So if I had to choose only one of these games, I would choose Trains instead of this. But I'm happy when I can play either one of these every now and then...

I had some fun during play but after the game, the more I was thinking about it the less I liked it. However fun the theme and the “stealing” is (it’s mostly Dominion meets Agricola-like worker placement and admittedly stolen ideas from some other games) it’s more of a good joke than a really good and well-developed game. And even for a joke it’s a bit too long, while it seems it should be all about collecting cards that make it possible to buy for lots of gold and take all your cards in your hand so in the endgame you can score a lot. For this you almost always have to choose the actions “buy” (or “buy twice”) and “get 1/2/3 gold” or “use a card twice” automatically with your workers… It’s just not much beyond that and it's not as interesting as it seemed first.

Played once, 4p.  Mash-up games are always tricky.  Generally, if you like a particular mechanic from game X, just play game X.  But, this was really not bad.  I did not have any fun in  my single game, but I don't know if that was the fault of the game or mine, and therefore I need to play at least once more.  I do actually like the main borrowed mechanisms of this game (deck-building, worker placement, climbing costs card drafting).

It's just as the description says it is:  a Eurogame putting together "euro-mechanisms" using deckbuilding, worker placement and Through The Ages + Agricola stylized Victory Points racing game with a finite number of turns.  It's proof that you can mesh euromechanisms to create a "new" game.  If you like these mechanisms, you might like the game.

Second play brought this game up to a 7 and I enjoyed it more.  Not sure if I can state why other than there appears to be multiple paths to victory.

-------------------------------

This didn't come across as anything special but the game does combine some of Dominion, Agricola, and Puerto Rico as well as Through the Ages in some interesting ways.  Most interesting to me was the Dominion aspect where you are building your deck to earn VPs on the VP track as well as the various offices.  My game does have a typo on the VP track as it jumps from 90 to 92 or something like that and the English translation also has an error about when blue cards can be played/executed.  I'm not convinced there is much to explore here.

While it is an impressive feat of design to combine the cores of Agricola and Dominion in such a smooth package – without prior knowledge of both games, it would be pretty hard to spot where Frankenstein Friese left the seams. Small touches like making increased workers a card effect rather than a permanent gain show that no little development work went into what might, at first glance, seem to be a rather frivolous design.

After a single play, I’m not sure whether this has a chance at captivating me only half as much as either of its primary parents, lacking both the sheer variety of Dominion’s kingdom card layouts and the lovely immediacy of Agricola’s theme. Quite possibly, another problem might be theme of vote hungry politicians in a bland bureaucracy, which strikes me as a good deal more cynical as the original premise of the game itself.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I admire the effort here. Friedman is an innovative game designer, but this exercise fell flat for me. The theme is a thin veneer on borrowed mechanics (which I realize was the point). The graphic design and illustration style were generic-looking and uninspiring. I kept looking at the board and thinking "I see a lot of pictures of office workers...but I have no idea what this has to do with an election." 

Although I was playing the game with some very smart cookies, there does seem to be some balance issues—we saw some card combinations which created massive victory point surges. In the end, I'd rather play Dominion...or Agricola...but not a mash-up of the two with a boring theme.

A mash-up of deck building (Dominion); worker placement with extra spaces becoming available in later stages (Agricola); card purchasing (Power Grid).  There is a lot going one, so things go much more smoothly if new players have already played the mechanics in the base games.  Fun theme, alot going on.  I expect that with more players things would get very chaotic. Really enjoyed it but not sure how much re-playability it would have for me.

Lowered the score of this number from first play as the variation of each game is sadly low. Both the available actions and market cards feel very much the same. While the game very successfully blends worker placement with deck building, the tension in worker placement and combination opportunity in deck building are a bit lacking. To me, it is more interesting for its game design than its game play. I am glad to have participated in this experiment for 504 but would have to move on. [b]Game[/b] 6 [b]Personal[/b] 5.

"The game is a wonderful example of where one game mechanic (worker placement) is used to address another game mechanic's weaknesses ("bad draw" of deckbuilders).

Despite the mediocre game design, I really can't say the game doesn't work - the tension still exists and it will appeal to most light boardgamers. 

The artwork is definitely fascinating. It brings a lot of laughters when we play it, which helps salvaging its rating a bit.

Copycat has a convoluted setup, cards with confusingly similar iconography, and a board entirely vacant of descriptions which makes the initial playthrough frustrating and successive plays just as bad to invite new players to attempt.

Although Copycat cribbed gameplay mechanics from popular games Through The Ages, Agricola, and Dominion, it fails by missing the crucial draw of those [superior] titles:
The variable priced card purchasing in Through The Ages gave the feel of differing technology in competing advancing civilizations.
Agricola is a farming game. Its draw was owning animals and creating a self-sufficient little world, the worker placement gameplay was the best way to achieve that feel.
The deckbuilding of Dominion was tied with the simplicity of being able to see all the cards available for purchase and to anticipate how they would effect your deck.

On top of bad execution, the political theme of Copycat is not one that many people are interested in. Rather than elevate the players' view of the subject, Copycat is a competition between corrupt, lying, cheating candidates which only further exacerbates an already universal dislike of its theme.

Congratulations to Friedemann Friese on taking mechanics of better games, and smearing them with a terrible theme, to produce an unlikeable mess. I'm sure you put a lot of effort into doing so, but the same result could have been achieved by just defecating into the game box.

Copycat lives up to its promises and its rumors: This game is indeed a mash-up of many favorite mechanics from the past 5 years, blended together with a political veneer.  Yes, it's as linear (not broken) as you've heard.  Yes, its humor fades after a couple of plays.

It was an interesting experiment that's STILL a better game for me than Notre Dame.  But barely.

Não sou fã da visão cínica da política. Acho que existe mais do que isso. Mas entendo o apelo disso para incluir em jogos. No caso do Copycat, por exemplo, seu objetivo é se eleger. Vale aceitar doações esquisitas, copiar discurso, essas coisas. Tudo isso comprando novos recursos, contratando mais gente pra campanha, etc. Na prática, o tema se perde. Mas a mecânica é divertida o suficiente para valer uma partida eventual.

RATING: 5
--- Preliminary thoughts ---

The blending of the various game mechanisms works well: the gameplay feels different from any of the copied games (except, maybe, Dominion).

It's a light game, easy to learn and has a nice flow, but it's too long for a game that shallow.

The theme is artificial; there is satire of the German politics in the cards that can keep you guessing if you're not German.

The art is typical in Friese games.

Critics:
-> Not balanced: there are good cards, not that good cards, and bad cards, and there's an evident dominant strategy; once you grasp it, it's only a matter of who is lucky enough to get the cards. 
-> The gameplay is very plain. There are not different paths to victory. Everybody does more or less the same.
-> The last rounds are way too important; compared to them, the previous rounds seem irrelevant.
-> Replayability is a huge issue: you will see the same cards and you will do the same strategies. You will do the same things over and over. Probably it won't last more than half a dozen game nights.

First impression (4 players): Combines Agricola and Dominion. There are plenty of good own ideas there but overall I didn't like too much.

It's a super interesting concept and the mashup of the games that have been copied actually works quiet nicely, eventually it's just not very "exciting". Higher level cards are usually just straight up better versions of the earlier ones, so there is no new cool effects but just improved already known ones, which is ok, but because it's always the same basic concepts the replay value is not as great for me.

不過主要的獲勝方式還是拿高分牌用複製動作
但是過程就是看誰能有效率的完成自己的快速組合手牌
要對手牌有熟悉都才能知道怎麼做比較好
連搶起始都會變得很重要
規則:
*起始每人10張牌，三個工人，一個分數標記跟順位標記
*行動牌庫照背後羅馬數字分疊洗勻，羅馬數字V的人數多少放多少張，照數字疊在一起最小的在上面(兩人遊戲移除23,32,49)，辦公卡也一樣照數字洗勻疊起，開第一張，三人以上加新的辦公卡
*遊戲每輪分成四個階段
1.抽五張牌，並選一張蓋著競標起始玩家，大的獲勝，平手交換位置，並將該牌橫置棄置一旁，這張牌不能再被使用(不是個人棄牌推)
2.輪流放置工人在辦公行動格，並可選擇現在起動或下階段起動(啟動就倒下)
過程中可用的卡牌(紫藍)可以使用
3.接下來照順位把牌全部出完(黃綠)，執行買牌或是拿分動作，買卡時必須把該卡左邊的紅卡全部拿走，買完不會補，接下來或得分數，拿到的分數token記玩分就放回供應區
4.清理階段，沒人擺的辦公格放一個分數token，會累加，所以這回合用掉的牌丟到棄牌推，當沒牌抽就把棄牌堆重洗，每個人保留三個工人，多的放回供應區，開新的辦公牌，按人數清掉行動牌並補新的
*所有的卡牌或工人分數都只能被*2一次
*遊戲在有人達到95分或是11回合結束或是有人買完最後一張羅馬數字V的卡結束(此卡不洗進牌庫)，平手最後一輪得分多的獲勝
*錢兩倍的卡是把所有錢*2
*分數加倍的是把分數token拿到的分數加倍
*保留卡可保留一張卡，不算進下回合的五張手牌，此張卡也不能被*2

Strangely warming as you're pulling on comfortable and well-worn clothes. You have to unlearn some habits learnt in the games which have been borrowed from, as each borrowed mechanic has a twist. You'll only get to go thru your deck a handful of times, so it's not so much combos but getting the best cards you can and leveraging their usefulness with the available actions (eg using the doubler action). There's a lot of luck seen in determining turn order (choosing and simultaneously revealing a high card) ... and turn order is crucial in action selection games. It'll result in determining what new deck-improving cards will be available to you for buying. Keeping track of what other types of things people have bought and what they might buy this turn if they're ahead of you in turn order is probably going to be useful. When offered a choice, you're generally choosing between cards that draw you more cards, give you more money, give you more VPs, or give you more actions. The standard stuff. All of which net out about the same, so it feels like just taking the best of which is on offer will serve you ok. Then the game comes down to action selection - when to take extra money, when to take extra VPs, etc. The main decision here is how many actions do you invest in boosting your purchase capability vs how much do you go for straight VPs right now. Or draw more cards and see what gets better. And judging when in the game the pendulum swings the other way given what you've drawn. Turn order is important. Did I say that before? It's a comfortable game, easily learnt, played and enjoyed, but one that probably all up requires you to depend more on luck that its combined antecedents does.

Copycat is aptly named: the designer (by his admission) has "borrowed" mechanics from a number of top games on BGG (including deckbuilding from Dominion, worker placement from Agricola, and drafting from Through the Ages), and combines them into one game.  Deckbuilding is definitely at the heart of it; you get money to buy you more cards that can give you a variety of things like money, VPs, more cards, or (temporarily) more workers.  The big difference is that VPs are on a track, so you can "use" the VP cards to advance, instead of them just being dead cards.  The worker placement aspect will get you buys, more money, more cards, etc., above and beyond what's in your hand.  Overall the game works together very well, but there is a lot less variety than in Dominion, as all of the cards tend to do the same sorts of things.  A good game, but not great.

A decent worker placement, deckbuilding game. Nothing too special about it, but it does everything very well. The art is cute and there are little hidden easter eggs on the board and on the cards. I don't know how many strategies are in this game, but focusing on victory points cards/tiles seems to be the way to go in our 2 plays.

RATING: 4.5
Thought I might get a kick out of the meta-humor going on with the game and I at least respect the games that this was cobbled together from, but there are a few problems. Firstly, the cards are boring. Dominion base game boring. They just give you more of basic game stuff. More points or more coins or more cards or more workers. Nothing particularly fun. Then there are weird doubling rules that just smack of emergency game glue that are totally out of place in an other wise straightforward endeavor. I wish the doublers weren't in the game, because that immediately means whoever has better cards gets to do the better things on those cards twice, and they win by even more. 

All in all, a below-average affair, which I probably should have surmised as I don't think Friese has ever designed a game that I have played and thought was adequate.

I really love the whole tongue-in-cheek humor of CopyCat. Stealing well-loved mechanics from other games portrait of himself on the cover is something only Friesse could pull off. I found the choices in the game fascinating, with a number of strategies available. I played really poorly, but that only increased my desire to play again. I do wonder if the game would hold up to repeated play without a larger variety of cards.

The problem for Friedemann Friese is that every new game he makes is compared wit Power Grid and he's just not been able to create such an excellent game again. But from the most recent ones he made, this is probably 1 of the best. You could call this game: deckbuilding - the boardgame version, but in a good way :-)

Although the gameplay mechanisms are pretty fun, and the humor is good, the two don't seem related at all. It is a little jarring to play a game, whereby it could just as easily be played with a completely different theme and it wouldn't detract from the gameplay. That is to say, I wish I really felt that I was running for office while I was plying this game, but I find myself feeling like I'm just accumulating victory points in a board game instead.

Meglepő, mégpedig, az, hogy mennyire jól működik. Izgalmas volt, és teljesen átjött a téma. :D
Egy bot taktikával sikerült célt érnem, ami nem válik szerintem a játék dicsőségére.(6 körtől csak gyp-re mentem és egy kör híja volt, hogy 3. legyek, így viszont behúztam.) Amire igazán nem is vagyok nagyon büszke. Kicsit azért Friese esetében mindent a power grid-hez mérünk - nem véletlen -  és valahol ez lehet a keresztje, mert ez egy igencsak feledésbe merült, fel sem tört játék, aminek nem látom az okát, mert ez is és ha már itt vagyunk az 504 is jól működő darab.

First Game played for me at BGGCon 2012.  My first play through found me lagging way behind because I never grabbed cards that let me draw more or have more workers to place...  2nd play was better but I wasn't generating victory points like I should. 

I like this hodgepodge of game mechanics. Lots of decisions to be made and you really have to watch how opponents are building their decks. Im not sure I'll ever be very competitive with this one as the competition in the game is clouded by managing your own deck.  Still there is a lot to like in this copy cat.

Played this about a dozen times (2 players) so far, and I am happy to report that Copycat is a charming and challenging little 'deckbuilding-with-a-board' game (or 'deckbuilding-meets-worker placement') that I am happy to keep in my game collection.

Replay value is not this game's biggest selling point, but rather the joy emerges from the way that the worker placement and deckbuilding aspects interweave to become a nifty efficiency race between players.

I own no other deckbuilders, but would venture that, as far as complexity is concerned,this one is on the simpler side. In this way it would make an excellent introduction to the deckbuilding mechanism for new players.

The bidding for turn order and humour embedded in the theme (light-hearted Machiavellian politics) are two of the more awesome elements in Copycat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Decent game but seems to be fairly limited.  The skull session card makes it too easy to recycle the same 5 or 6 cards every round, so the goal becomes to get a 10 point card and play/double it every turn yielding around 25 to 30 points per round for the last 3 or 4 rounds.  Simple rules make this a good light weight game for beginners, but replay value is very limited for competitive players.

[2 plays] I enjoy the theme/artwork although I admit the mechanics could be easily layered into another theme. The decisions about what to buy and when (and getting yourself into position to buy at the right moment) are subtle, and the players who miss the opportunities for the better cards may find themselves frustrated as they fall behind.

I'm interested to try this as a two player game where it might be best like St Petersburg.

Wow!, from the creator of Power Grid.  What a huge disappointment.  I was looking forward to the idea of combining the concepts of other games and rolling them into one.  In fact, if this was done in a real attempt to make a fun and innovative resource management-deck building-drafting-worker placement game and it still failed, I would have gave it a five.  I really feel that this game is more of a spoof/joke game such as Munchkin, and the joke is on the poor sap who shelled out $50 or $60 for some bits.

Firese új játékának nem titkolt célja a leghíresebb játékok jó mechanizmusának egybegyúrása. Dominion féle pakliépítés, TTA féle kártyavásárlás és Agricola féle akcióválasztás. A játékot jól sikerült megcsinálnia, jól működik, éppen elég gondolkodásra sarkall, de nem kell azért igazán AP-tól tartani. A gondom az volt, hogy a lapok igaz elég változatosak, de szerintem egyértelműen vannak jobbak és kevésbé jók. A sima pénz-győzelmi pont stratégia túl egyszerű és elég erős. Félek attól, hogy bár a kártyák véletlenszerűen jönnek, nem elég változatos a játék egy-egy új partiban. Kicsit talán készíthette volna könnyedebbre, rövidebb játékidejűre és talán kevesebb győzelmi pontot adó lappal, akkor biztosan jobbra értékelném. A játék poénos rajzfilmes grafikája nekem kifejezetten tetszett.
Nem rossz játék a Copycat, de nem is érzem elég jónak. Mindegyik másolt játék jobb a maga nemében az összegyúrtnál.

RATING: 6
The game is named Copycat because Friese copied the mechanics of 3 other popular games as well as some ancillary mechanics and references to even more.  The action spaces and worker placement mechanics are taken from Agricola, the deck building from Dominion, and the card market from Through the Ages (the only one of the 3 I haven't played but I've played Nations which I'm told is similar).  All set to a mostly non-existent theme of running for political office.

This is a good game.  I enjoyed my one play.  I was even skeptical of how these mechanics would all fit together but it's actually done really well and played smoothly and made a lot of sense.  However, I'm definitely not going to keep this game.  The game is reasonably simple despite two of its three parts being taken from reasonably heavy games and there's not a lot going on or many hard decisions to be made.  There are decisions to be made, mind you, but after one play you can easily identify what paths are optimal.

There's also very little variety to this game.  Every card either draws you cards, gives you more workers, or gives you money or victory points.  Like I said, well designed game that I enjoyed my first play of, but this gives it a VERY short lifespan.  In my case, that lifespan is exactly one game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Copycat is a game about politics (really?!) using worker placement (slash) deck building (slash) luck, in order to get players into the business. In fact, and it’s an assumed fact, Copycat is a pastiche of a very good variety of games, such as Agricola, Through the Ages or Dominion.

Players build their decks throughout the game but in the end, it doesn’t count what you built (like in Dominion or London) but only what you can get as a result of your card drawing in every specific turn of the game. It’s not a negative opinion, as a result, but it lacks a bit of strategic feeling when players are only rewarded for what they can actually play instead of what players have built! This makes me not to want to buy anything in the last turn, for example, and only send my prayers to the cards’ gods in order to get that specific draw in that specific timing (endgame).

During the game, players can buy cards and get victory points. That’s great but I missed the necessity of buying and build my deck because also the main actions (a la Agricola) improve and multiply during the game making the deck building a bit obtuse or only half necessary?! In the end, one can play with his own deck but, if the times are difficult, Copycat can solve the problem at a certain extent as it gives players the opportunity to ‘build’ their decks in the action selection present on the board, from turn to turn.

Not a bad game, for sure, but not a great one too. I don’t feel the need to explore it more than once or twice as a strategy quest. Maybe as an indulgent hour of play for pleasure. Maybe!

A game that is, ostensibly and consciously, a sum of  parts from other games needs to add up to more than said parts. not be smaller and distorted. Copy cat does not quite manage it - if any thing this feels like FF searching for a riff. Humorous, well produced but that's as good as it gets. 

I think the genius of FF might  be well served by a year away from game design. This is the product of a total lack of inspiration. Nothing wrong with it, but its treading water at best

RATING: 6
Notoriously designed with the specific intention of borrowing from famous games, Copycat is basically a deckbuilding game with bolted-on worker placement and a Through the Ages style card train. It's mostly straightforward -- the worker placement allows for cards like "place an extra worker this turn" and "place a worker in an already-used spot" -- except for the doubling spaces and copy cards.

Instead of buying cards worth points, as in Dominion, some cards give points when played. Playing into the copycat theme, some worker spaces and cards allow for another card to be duplicated. The ideal turn is to play a card worth high points, then copy it and double it a few times. The tricky part is in achieving that.

The art is great and the worker placement does add something. The card train is a perfect fit for the genre. But it suffers from the usual deckbuilding problems in that it is tedious and slow with players who don't know what they're doing and the ratio of play to housekeeping is skewed far in the wrong direction. This is only exacerbated by the fact that most of the available actions are pretty dull -- it's like going back to the Dominion basic set after seeing what the expansions have to offer. "Is that all?"

I expect that I'd play the heck out of it on my iPad, but as it is, it's a great 30-45 minute game with a listed playtime of 95 minutes. With an experienced group, no teaching... I'd play it again. But around these parts it's not going to get played enough to be worth playing at all. Under those circumstances it's a 6 or even higher. 

In practice, my rating is 4; I would have to be persuaded.

I wanted to like this game more than I did, I love the theme and from the designer of Power Grid I was expecting a gem. But ultimately the game was too easy and the decisions were very straightforward and uninteresting. It quickly became a get-more game where you are always going to get tons of points and things but who will get more than the other? It didn't help that there are very few cards that give you extra workers and they come early so if a player misses out on getting one of those they will watch themselves slip in points the longer the game goes on as those with extra workers just get more stuff.

For such a blatant mish-mash, Copycat works. I did not go into this game expecting to like it. It combines worker placement with deck-building (two mechanics that I have not really been a huge fan of in the past), along with a handful of other odds and ends. The theme is largely superfluous (something about an election or political something something, who cares?), but when all is said and done, the game builds a nice tension without going overboard on a lot of individual powers that you have to memorize ahead of time to be effective (such as in Le Havre). There are a number of different possible strategies, and the game encourages you to play again and again to experiment with various tactics. I like it. It's not mind-blowing, but it is very enjoyable.

Easy to see after even one play that this is a deck builder where you can reliably design a strategy and usually use it from game to game, as you'll see the same cards each game, and you're never at a loss for action spaces. Enjoyable, but not one that will see the table very often.

This is a decent effort in trying to combine Through the ages, Dominion and Agricola. Actually,it does more than try, it's quite succesful in combining them. However combining the best of 3 does not result in the best ONE. The game works, but the important stuff pretty much happened in the three last turns. And since this game isn't shorter or not much shorter (or longer in comparison to Dominion) I'd choose any of the three games it pays homage to over it.

This game falls under the category of "pleasant". All the mechanics make sense and work well together. After a couple plays I really enjoy it, but I don't see this remaining fresh in the long term. What variability there is in the card setup and random deck draws isn't enough to drastically alter the best path to victory for any particular game -- in other words, the same strategy (or maybe two strategies) will almost always work well.

Copycat is a game that I'd just assumed wasn't good. I don't even remember why now. My friend Maciek often finds sleeper hits, so I was willing to give it a try.

The game takes its name from the fact that it copies game mechanisms from other games. It has a card purchase row similar to Through the Ages. It's a deckbuilder similar to Dominion. It has some action spots and a tableau of face down cards that are also action spots and flip up one per round like Agricola. And it has point tokens that get placed on action spots that aren't taken like Puerto Rico. And it feels like none of those games at all.

In a round, you draw five cards, choose one to bid for turn order. Then in turn order you allocate your three workers on action spots. Finally, in turn order, you play all your cards and resolve all your actions.

Most of what you do in the game is get money or get points. There's also ways to get temporary workers which you can use in the current round or draw more cards. The game is a race to 95 points (maybe different in different player counts?) with whoever has the most points winning.

The game art has a very family-friendly/childish feel to it, similar to Automania. And the game is fairly straightforward. There's not really much to do other than get money, buy cards, get points, draw more cards or get workers. But it's about being the person to make all that work together best.

In our play everyone went a different way. One player was all about getting cards, one was all about getting extra workers and another was all about points. Interesting the game was decided on a tie-breaker. I like games where different strategies are equally valid. I enjoyed this one a lot.

Ugly but decent game. Seems that the game testing should have done more balancing. 
Grap more money when you can!

After reading the rules, I realized it had the potential to be a great game.

80% of the way into the first play, I felt this was true.  I was going to give it a 8.5 - 9.  But then I saw how the game ends.  The player who happened to draw the biggest card on the final round used it for bidding for first player.  That player got points in the final (and mots important round), while other players got very few points.

I'm still a big fan, and will probably play it a number of times, but the way it ended has left a bit of a sour taste.

Mix of good mechanics + improbable theme = okay game, not bad, not great...

[+] strong sense of progression (slow start, super strong last turns, you keep getting more things done in a single turn, combos get better, etc.), multiple viable strategies, easy rules, easy to teach
[-] theme, components and art are on the low side; not easy for 4p to get equally good cards (not enough high scoring cards 6VP/10VP/double VP), so usually someone who can't get those card will be left behind in 4p game!

update: tried it with 2p, it becomes very fast (game ended 3 turns early! cards level 4/5 not even in play yet), bonus VP pile up fast so very little time to develop any strategies. like with 4p, I found some cards to be too powerfull: 6VP / double-bonus VP

I liked this game, but of all the games it copies, it copies Dominion the most. I believe the deck building part of the game is much more important than anything else. If you build a crappy deck, it doesn't matter which spaces on the board you use in the worker placement phase, you're going to lose. And I did.

It was interesting, but ultimately if felt like Dominion to me, get more actions, use money to buy new cards, eliminate bad cards from your deck. If I didn't own Dominion I would have no problem owning this.

One thing that was very odd is that point cards in your deck don't automatically score, you have to play them from your hand each turn to score. This meant that cards with big points weren't worth purchasing in the last couple of rounds, as they didn't have time to work through your deck and be played, so you were better off just using board spots that gave you points directly.

It's interesting how the mechanics fit so well together, but it seems like the deck building element feels like it should allow for long play, but doesn't. 

Will be looking to play again knowning how the deckbuilding element works with the number of rounds.

Friedemann Friese designed this game by combining the famous mechanic from Dominion and Agricola, deck building and worker placement, and comes out with such unique game in Copy Cat. I don't know why, but this game is a less favorite in my gaming group.

A mash-up of mechanics from popular games, that however doesn't rise above the sum of its parts. Fun, but not great.

it definitely works but it is too long for what it is, i prefer to play dominion or agricola instead, even if the merging of these two games was technically good

A board game on politics might as well be about going to the dentist. And knowing it is a Frankenstein of game mechanics taken from other ground breaking games doesn't help.

RATING: 5
Decent game with a mess of an end game.  There's too much doubling and doubling of doubling on the final few turns.  It's not only hard to predict if your end game plan will work, but it's kind of frustrating to lose to someone who gets one more double effect off than you do.

The most dull game experience in a long time, the title of the game do not lie, it's far to simmilar to the two better game it has taken it's mechanics from, dominion and agricola, for it to be worth playing copy cat.

7.5 after 1 play.

I am not a deck-building fan, primarily due to the lack of player interaction. Copycat manages to include deck-building with some player interaction. The theme feels a little dry and pasted on. Otherwise, an above average game.

The worker placement of Agricola plus the deck-building of Dominion plus the card row of Through the Ages, all trimmed down to their most basic form and given a humorous political theme...sounds odd but it works...great game!

Had some mixed feelings about playing this game. I mean, everything inside is borrowed from another big game. Agricola, Dominion, Through the Ages, Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico. Mechanics used in those games, are in this game. How can such different games combined into a new interesting game? Not, I was sure, but after playing it, I will have to admit that Friedemann Friese did the job. It’s not a spectacular game, but it’s nice to see how the mechanics of the famous games are woven into each other very smooth, and make this a nice game.

Amazing:  Lift some core mechanisms from several of the biggest games of recent years, alter them a bit, introduce a sinister little mechanism, and somehow make a very streamlined product.  This really works quite well!  The card conveyor inspires your tactics for the turn, including how hard you fight for turn order.  That is a fight done by a forced sacrifice of 20% of your hand!  :thumbsup::yuk:  It's a discard that is even harder than the one in [thing=23205][/thing].  Of course, your deckbuilding feeds not only your bidding ability, but also your purchasing and point-snarfing abilities, and your worker placement potential.  It might sound like a cobbled-together mess, but it certainly doesn't feel that way.  The rules are simple* and flow well*, and this easy-to-learn* game is rather fun!

[size=7]* Except for the doubling caps, which I'm still not completely confident I understand maximally.[/size]

Excellent game with very good mechanics and a great theme displayed well throughout all its components. My only quibble is the replay-ability factor. As silly as it sounds, after 6 plays in a short amount of time (4 weeks), the game started feeling a little worn out. My suggestion is to use it as a gateway game to introduce new gamers to the mechanics of worker placement, deckbuilding etc.

Possible a little simple for some players, and the theme is definitely pasted on, but the three players enjoyed themselves.  Game time is spot on.  We finished in exactly 90 minutes including explanation.

This is really clever 'gaming art' and created from other games mechanics but cleverly out together. This is a solid game , can drag if someone gets lots of add cards, add people actions , and that just takes the edge off it for me.

After several play, i must say i had overestimate it. It's replayability is not that mush, and without real soul in this game. Additionally, they is one strong strategy to win. I Still rated it 8 because it's hard to achieve optimization.

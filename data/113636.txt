120908 I typically don't like programming ahead in my games, but aside from the longish rules explanation, I think I will like this game.  I hope it may go up -- I doubt up enough that I'd feel compelled to pick it up myself, but its a fun game even though it doesn't have the wacky craziness of Robot Rally (which I do hope to play again at some point!)

RATING: 6.5
A brain-burner of a Euro-game with ingenious mechanics but nothing to engage me with the theme. It really seems pasted on. There are multiple paths to victory, but the gameplay is not intuitive. However, it is clever and once learned, it starts to flow. I have not played a game quite like it. There is a lot to like here.

+ The programmed action-mechanic is super interesting and leads to very tough decisions; Trying to out-guess your opponents and their moves adds a nice additional layer to the game.
- It seems that it's just lacking that one special something to send it over the edge into being a great game.


Why it's previously-owned:
There are just too many other good games that take up the 3-4 player, econ/points genre to let this one get to the table instead.
This was part of the trade that brought in Dragon Valley and the Asara expansions.

At first the game appears difficult to get into and while the rules are clear, they are difficult to absorb. But soon they sink in and you see the cleverness in the design.

It's a very good planning game and the situation on the board helps to determine what you do each turn. Very enjoyable and I look forward to more games soon.

Edo is surprisingly deep for how simple the rules are. It has a very interesting interplay between sort of worker placement and action programming. The only real goals in the game are turning a small set of resources into simple buildings on the board to get points and income (or outright buy points from the merchant). But the action programming decisions are hard! It's an optimization puzzle with some fairly tough decisions.

The aesthetics of the game could be a bit better. It looks very abstract and messy when the game design itself is actually very clean. I think that the game's look and feel is a small hindrance. But I still think it's a very good game. The best part of the components is how chunky the resources and action programming tiles are. I like thick, solid components.

Edo is a resource converter; we are gathering together stuff (wood, stone and money in this case) in order to build buildings.  There is some light engine building and the question is when to switch to all out point gathering.  So far, so boring.  Happily, a few other elements make the game more interesting.  The first of these is action programming.  This is made angsty by tiles that each feature four actions.  Regularly, you will want to use two actions on a tile and can only pick one.  In sequencing three actions it is important to consider what others may be doing; it seems that suppliers in olden Edo operated Soviet-style rationing rather than increasing production when more customers turned up.  

A further element is that buildings are erected in cities and that your income from each city is dependent on (a) how many others you are sharing it with, and (b) how great your buildings’ influence is relative to others.  For the most part, Edo treats money as another resource.  It is worth points at the end of the game, though its 50:1 conversion rate is poor.  However, there are enough things to spend it on to keep the struggle to increase your income at the expense of others interesting.

To present a game of efficiency and timing in a way that is engaging to me is quite a feat.  In the longer term, I wonder if it offers genuine strategic options to match its tactical fun or whether I will find my play becoming formulaic.

Production quality is to Queen’s usual standards, with only the weedy first player widget disappointing.  The artwork is decent and functional, though unremarkable.  The English rules are uncharacteristically vague on a few points.  Do download the FAQ.

This game is filled with little surprises.  On it's surface, it comes across as a typical worker placement game crossed with an area majority game.  And while true, the surprise comes from the angst of picking the right action on the tiles to perform your actions.  Oh those devilish action tiles!  As soon as you figure out how to combo your actions to work, you realized that 2 of the actions you need are on the same tile.  Then you realize you might have some challenges to keep all your workers on the board where you need them to complete your plans the next turn, but also need them back so you can do more / other actions, and you start to think you'll be lucky to sustain anything into the next turn...  and it happens turn after turn after turn.  This feeling really brings this game up a notch and definitely makes it worthy of revisiting.  The design is solid and it's easy to see how expansions can be brought into play quite easily.

Ticks most of the boxes for me: Simultaneous action selection, medium-length, need to pay attention to others, seems to scale well.

First play. Production quality is good but pieces are not as numerous nor quality as high as previous reviews have announced. This game does not need a Plano box.

Action selection mechanic is very clever and this reminded me of Wallenstien a little. Predictably all the good moves seem to be on the same tile. Overall the structure of the game seems well developed but for some reason the planning element falls down owing to the slightly unpredictable moves by the others. With four players this did seem at times a complete lottery. Yes you can plot what resources someone might be chasing but where players build is not always a mathematical certainty.

I thought I was going to be bowled over by this but I wasn't. I'd play again but I'm not sure I'd buy it.

Interesting middle weight worker placementish game with a nice Japanese theme and good production values where players simultaneously plan their three actions in advance from choices in tiles. Most tiles have four actions to choose from; although some can be acquired that have less actions albeit more powerful ones. The tiles are rotated to choose from among the actions. Once all the players choose their actions, they take turns activating them.

Points and income are acquired for constructing different types of buildings in cities and from a wandering merchant. Once a player reaches twelve points, the game ends in that round. So it's sort of a race to build buildings for points; although there are different avenues to acquire points at the end of the game. Do not get caught off guard enhancing and refining your engine; this is a race to get to twelve points first and sometimes the game ends abruptly. 
 
I enjoyed the overall flow of the game; in particular, the resource management aspect, the different paths to victory, getting the right tile action combos and the production values all in a quick timeframe. It's tight, tense, fun and rewards the more experienced. 

My first game ran about 90 minutes, but once we knew the gist of the game, on our second run it only took 45; so I would categorize this one in the super-filler category. 

I enjoyed my first two plays and the game left me hungry for more. The rating, for now, is a seven, but if the replayability and gameplay shine in the next few games, it will definitely go up. I'm looking forward to getting the expansion to see what it adds to the experience.

I enjoy this game.  The limit of 3 actions per turn & only 12 turns per game, really makes you feel you will never get that last action that you need to win.  Adds nice tension to the game.  Also the 4 or 2 actions per action tile adds tension as well - you can only do one action per tile & only 3 tiles/actions per turn. I always wanted to do 2 actions from the same tile.

Noted that a expansion is coming out - I can't wait to play with that, but the game does not need it.  There is alot of depth to figure out and keep gaming.  (ei-replayable without the bells & whistles that some need to make each game feel different)

A decent simultaneous planning game. What your opponent does very mildly affects your planning. Do not even listen to the comments about any comparisons to RoboRally because it does not resemble it at all.

It really isn't worker placement. It's more like an action point allowance system.

The only knock is that there isn't much possibility of catching up if you are behind.

Overall, quite okay considering it plays in 1 hour.

In Edo, you'll need to manage several resources (money, wood, stone, rice, and workers) and combine that with wise action selection in order to build the most buildings and thus score the most points.  If this sounds all too familiar to you, keep reading, because it's actually a very neat new twist on the familiar old theme!

In a turn, you first select actions via an innovative action selection mechanism.  You have three square tiles, with each edge of the squares specifying a different action.  So, you rotate and arrange the tiles, creating a sequence of three actions you would like to perform.  This creates very difficult decisions as it really limits what you csn do, but also provides you with many options of combinations.

Furthermore, each action will require that you use at least one worker to activate it, and maybe even have another worker on a specific area of the board in order to carry out that action.  For example, to collect wood, you need a worker to activate the tile, as well as another worker on a wood collection space of the board.  So, you must carefully manage how many workers you have on the board vs. off the board in order to carry out your chosen sequence of actions!

Then each player carries out his actions, one at a time.  Actions let you do things such as gather materials, move your guys around, buy new action tiles that are better than your starting set, make deals with a traveling merchant that offers you special exchanges that change each round, and build buildings (which score you points, as well as earn you money at the end of each round through a neat little area majority system).

At the end of a round, player must feed their workers on the board rice, which even further makes the worker placement decisions more difficult!  More workers means you can get more done, but also means you'll need more rice to keep them out there.  Always a difficult decision!

Play continues in rounds until one player reaches 12 points, and the most points after some additional end game scoring wins!

Overall, Edo is a very good euro-style gamers game that takes some familiar mechanics and merges them with a few cool new twists to create a fresh new and engaging strategy game.  And it does this all while maintaining a very intuitive and easy to understand set of rules.  I really look forward to playing more and discovering all the strategic possibilities!

I really like Maharaja, with the two action simultaneous selection, racing around and trying to build palaces. And frankly, I don't remember how I came across Edo, but my first thought was, "sounds a lot like Maharaja."

After one play, I see a lot of similarities, but they are each their own game. Edo challenges you to use four-sided tiles, each with its own distinct action, and set them up 1-2-3 choosing only one side. You use "workers" to activate each tile a certain number of times.

The game is an excellent example of tough decisions, as you often want to do two things on the same tile. The rest of the game is a bit like Maharaja in that you're racing around to build buildings, and money provides flexibility of moving around. There's more resources in Edo, but the game is still very approachable for gamers and it all comes together. 

The two other people that played a first game really enjoyed it as well, and I suspect I can get this to the table again.

Update: Another play with five, and another enjoyable game. I'm really digging this one. Bumping it up to a 9.

Players have to manage their limited resources (which are actions in this case) very well to win.  You have to make 3 pre-planned choices per turn and it's often a hard decision to make.

The decisions you make are further complicated by needing to guess your opponents intentions.  There is a ton of timing to the game in regards to your opponents.  It can be tricky. 

The theme is supposedly pasted on, but whatever it kinda works.

Also a very good 2 player game.

Edo is a fun play with manageable rules.  You do compete with other players for resources, but there are enough choices to work around that.  A fast start is key with the way the competition works for the city scoring.  Making sure that you make the most of your officials takes a couple turns to figure out, which is a nice part of the game.  I also like the hidden action selection.  The options available on each card fit well with the upgrade cards you can buy.  Solid game.  Very good.

Got to play this with the group that finished off FCM at the Gaming Hoopla. It's a light/mid-weight area control game where actions are programmed using a set of tiles that contain actions on each edge. This means that if a tile has been used for an action, the other 3 actions cannot be programmed that round. This puzzle become frustrating as the game goes on if you haven't setup moves to accommodate that constraint or you haven't purchased additional programming tiles. Other than the programming puzzle, the game is a straightforward meeples on a map to collect resources and control regions for influence. The game does seem broken in that you can skip feeding your workers and fire them every round and then hire them back without penalty.

Players are developing Edo (Toyko) and its surrounds during the 16th century.  Interesting game where players set up the turn by pre-programming three actions, from an initial selection of twelve possible actions.  The potential actions are presented on large, square tiles, four per tile - and players flip the tile to the action they wish to perform, and insert it into a tile rack - hidden from their opponents.  Actions are then revealed and taken, one at a time, around the table.  They are used to draw resources (rice, wood, stone), move pieces onto and around the board, interact with the merchant (more resources, or purchase victory points), or building (houses, markets or fortresses for more victory points).  A very tight, intense, thinky game where you scrap for every victory point you can, else you will be left behind.  The game ends (rather suddenly) when somebody builds past the twelve victory point level, and a few bonus points are handed out for pieces on the board and cash in hand.  This is a nice game that deftly wedges you into several dilemmas - reminded me a bit of Princes of Florence, where you have 21 actions and they all must count.  A very nice Kickstarter experience too - well done, Queen Games.

The game certainly works, but the draw for me was the rotating action tiles. Other reviews made the mechanism seem like a brain burner, but I was neither intimidated nor engaged in it.

Really enjoyed this one. A bit long for what it is, but a real brain-burner. So few actions, so many ways to screw up! Timing and turn order are important, getting cheap food is vital, getting to the Merchant, getting Samurai on the board, it's all vital and yet you can't do this if you do that and aaaaargh!

The use of the action cards is very well designed, and the way new ones come in makes a big difference to your plans. Very nice game, couldn't really find anything to complain over, except that over 2 hours for 10 rounds is a lot. First plays though, so we'll get faster.

I played it once and it was horrible. I tried to guess what the other players would do and was most of the time wrong. This led to situations where my moves where massively hindered (getting 2 instead of 6 ressources, both of the places where I could have built a stronghold blocked by the player to my right,...)
Usually I don't mind if other players move give me a difficult life because I can react to it. 'If you do this than I can do that...' But here I have to plan everything in advance and have to stick to my plans knowing the moves I do now are rubbish. It would be much better If I could react in some way. If you would be forced to play the three actions you choose but in any order you want or be able to pay some money to turn your card or... but so it was too frustrating.
I have no such feelings with Roborally but there this planning and the interchanges with other plans is all the fun. And it is more some fun game. But Edo is a strategy game and there I want to have mechanics to get some controll...

Played again with 3 players. It was much better. Rated it up from 4 to 6.

There is a lot to like about Edo, the components are the usual high Queen Games standard, the rules are well written, the game plays quite quickly and the battle for points is tight.

However, the preplanning really hurts my head, it is so easy to mess up your entire turn. Also, nothing unexpected ever happens so it all seemes a bit dry.

The game is good, and I won't tear down a game, however, I won't look to buy it. It's really nice at sight, but the mechanics are those we have seen in other games, well implemented, but nothing new. Select your actions in secret and then move your pawns or collect resources....

It's a long time since Queen Games released a true gamers game(since Lancaster). I like this one; low on luck, interaction, and a planning phase similar to Wallenstein, but because there are 4 different actions on one card and you use only three cards, often you have to prioritise what you want to do, because of the distribution of the actions on the cards. The only thing I found odd was that a player was able to get in a single (!) round half of the points needed to finish the game (building two fortresses).

The game is solid and even has some novelty in the way it restricts your choices, with different actions being on the same tile. It reminded me a bit of "Fresco" in the action selection and some more of "Maharaja" in the board action and majority-based income. Everything works, but in the end you are still gathering resources to construct buildings in a very abstract Euro with very bland artwork. I would gladly play it again, but I just can't get excited by this kind of game anymore.

RATING: 3.5
Ouch... I did expect MUCH more from this, but it failed in every aspect.

It sounds great, but in fact it's pretty boring without any tense moments. It's pretty much solitaire, too. While there are a good amount of actions to take, most of them are not used at all. We rarely used the move action, as you can move before each action for some money, so why waste an action for it?
The extra tiles you can buy are rarely interesting enough and don't change alot anyway.

I could go on with the components (tiny huts, but huge rice tokens), but who cares. The game itself is just not interesting at all.

RATING: 7.5
A good Euro.  You only have 3 actions each turn, although some you can do more than once if you have the Agents/Samurai needed (sometimes both).

You start with 3 action cards, each one with 4 possible actions.  Problem is there is always one on which you'd like to do two actions, but you can only select one...

Makes for some tough decisions.

Trade is key, IMHO.

We had a player who never feed her Samurai until the last turn... She finished 2nd.  So instead of spending an action collecting rice, she spent it sending Samurais on the board and moving them.  Interesting action management.

Collecting resources can be iffy, as the more Samurai in that location, the less resources you collect.

Points are made when building (House-1, Trading Post-2, Fortress-3, and trading).  Income is generated in each city when you have a House or your Trading Post, and is affected by the number of players with buildings in that location (ie. area majority).

I've probably changed my mind about this game more times than of any one else. It has some clever mechanisms and it hits a sweet spot in terms of complexity. In the other hand, it feels dry and tedious at times. It possibly has some balance issues. But even worse is the fact that the publisher cut down the game to 4 players to put the tokens of the fifth player into a separate expansion.

RATING: 7
Edo is a Eurogame at heart, make no mistake: limited number of actions, check, limited number of workers, check, wooden resources, check- but it has some interesting ideas that make it different from the crowd.

Actions are limited by number available (3/turn), workers available to select the actions (5/starting, can increase), workers on the board in location to take the action (worker placement/movement), total# of workers on a given space (decreasing scale of reward vs. single slot action), and finally by the arrangement of actions on the hidden action selection cards (2 or 4/card).

Because of the board placement and secret selection process, Edo becomes more interactive- will player A select that location or not, will player B put a samurai there to limit resources just to interfere.

Because of the set of choices on each card, choosing the best order for actions becomes more critically a part of the game.

All this makes it more interactive, and even leaner than some other worker placement games where obtaining a slot based on turn-order guarantees an action is completed.

This will probably frustrate some players, but it also means that action choices and placements need to be very focused on other players choices, so it emphasizes interactive play.

So far that frustration is clear in ratings, as Edo hasn't gotten as much love, but I think that it definitely adds interest here.

The artwork is fairly abstract, but the boards, cards and bits are very solid and overall work well together (though I personally dislike the thematic numeric font). The theme is pretty thin underneath- there isn't a lot besides the artwork which ties it to the Heian period and the Shogunates, but it manages to present an attractive picture. 

So the game is a good piece of work, creating a different style of worker placement/resource management eurogame. With a more integrated theme, this might rate higher, but I am rating this a 7 after 3 plays.

I think the expansions add some variation and interest as well, and a lot of care went into trying to separate this from other eurogames. It may not grab you like Agricola, but this deserves a little attention, and it's not a bad game at all, but perhaps a little lean.

Programmable movement with some room for error.

You start off with three boards that each have four different actions on them. You set which action you want to do first, second, and third and how many workers you will have do each action. Many actions require one worker on the board and one behind the screen, but some actions you can do twice if you have two workers on the board, two behind screen, etc. Then each person executes their board one phase at a time.

Sometimes it can be frustrating when someone beats you to doing the action you wanted to do because it usually hampers you (ie: if no one is collecting stone, then the first worker in each of the two spots collects 3 stone. However if there is already a person there, then it is decreased to collecting 2 stone at that location, etc). The "room for error" is that you may change your mind a little. Like if I wanted to build a building in City A, but someone else built there, I can change my mind to build in City C instead if that now seems more optimal.

A nice worker placement using three step programmed actions (it's designed with 4 actions per card but only one can be played, so you can't take all the actions you really want to).  Reasonably simple and quick to play (around 6 turns or so).  Gets a little AP as you try to maximize point gain (which is very low, end turn activates when someone gets to 12 points).  Expansion adds resource blockers (ronin), cost reducers for movement (temples), and additional point scoring paths (the Shogun's court).  Allows for a great deal of individualization and re-playability.  Might be an 8, but I need to play this more to see.

The programming aspect is fun, and it really forces you to put together a whole big plan. Especially near the end when you know you need to be able to get 4 points in the next two turns running through the permutations can be either fun and interesting or tedious and AP inducing depending on your perspective. For me it's the former. But that said the end game can be gamed a bit in a sort of weird, unsatisfying way.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2017)

I bought Edo by mistake, I meant to buy Yedo, but I only realized my mistake this month. Still Edo is a well-regarded game here on BGG, so I was expecting a good euro game, but I was (somewhat) disappointed by it.

Edo´s rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 15 minutes. Playtime is around 90 minutes.

The theme of the game is cool, but you don’t feel it through the game, it is pasted on.

The components are very good, but the art is regular. The game board is dull looking (like many Queen Games games).

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t obvious, but they aren’t very complex either, it has a light-medium weight. Each player needs to plan his turn playing three different cards. In each action card you have 4 available options and you need to choose one. The available actions are collect wood, rice or stone, gain money, build, get a new card, deploy more meeples, recruit more meeples, buy from a merchant. The action you choose can, generally, be boosted using more meeples. It all sound really exciting, but when you begin playing, the decisions aren’t as interesting as I thought they will be. I was expecting a heavier/meatier game, there is no tension within the game.

In general, Edo has a low luck factor. The luck affects what the merchant is selling and which new cards appear.

I feel it has a low replay value.

The game´s end is triggered when a player pass the 12VP mark. This, practically, guarantees that scores will be very close to each other at the end. 

Bottom line, I was expecting a heavier game. Some years ago I would have loved the game, but now I found it to have (mostly) simple decisions and I found it mildly boring. It doesn’t bring anything really exciting or new to the table. I already sold it along with its (unplayed) expansions. Edo is an ok game to introduce to new gamers, but it is not for us. Still, I recognize it is a solid Euro game (thus the high rating) but I crave heavier experiences these days. I don’t think I will ever play it again as there are much better games out there that do a lot better what Edo does.

Only one play however, in our 2p game, I attempted to play the "long-game" and build a machine while my DH ignored the "game" and just scapped up points at the market turn after turn and ran away with the lead.  I felt like all my "work" playing the "game" was a complete waste of time and effort.  Build in Edo?  Build anywhere?  Pointless.  Labor over movements and which tiles to choose?  Pointless.  Special task cards?  Waste of time and money.  Pointless.  Beautiful artwork and the IDEA was unique, it just didn't matter in the end.  Hoping the expansion resolves some of this.

A decent game and not too long.  The planning is the best bit.  The actual actions you take is a little boring.  This game has samurai (cool!) but they never fight (wahhh).  Peaceful samurai who collect resources and build stuff is no fun.  Also, this game is meant to happen over 200-ish years, so why do the samurai move around the board as if its the timeframe of a Runebound type game?  Finally, the board is a bit difficult to see - very pretty, but not so functional.

At its core Edo is your usual Euro with action selection/programming as central mechanism (vaguely similar to Wallenstein), limited engine building and board play introducing an area majority component with secondary spatial aspects. A remarkable feature is the abundance of money which I could use in my first game to score the decisive additional VPs in end scoring to win. Scores will be close as the game ends when the first player reaches 12 VP and the final tally is performed. If you enjoy squeezing out that last bit of efficiency from every action, Edo is your game. It's on the dry and almost abstract side but the engine is finetuned.
While I like the action programming part, I'm not too fond of having to implement the norm strategy of getting additional workers first, then setting up your engine to use actions more efficiently, finally transforming gained resources to VPs.

Just because it is set in Japan doesn't make this type of influence theme any more palatable. I think a game like Edo may have been convincing if released 10 years ago, but now there is just nothing unique or refreshing about the design.

This one made an excellent first impression.  There is some similarity to Settlers in that you are racing to a point total (12) but then the round is still finished and whomever has the most points at that point will win.   Resources are gathered, money is accrued/earned often through majorities of building using resources in the cities, and the market can be visited for points or resources to purchase.  Each person has 3 tiles with four actions on them with a number of workers required both in the land of Edo and out on the tile to take the action.  More action tiles can be purchased that only have a choice of two actions, one of which is usually enhanced.  Wrestling with the number of workers available, choosing which of the actions on each tile to take, and anticipating your opponents' actions are paramount to success.  After one play, I want to revisit this one.

Drops to a 7.  Second play left me with some concerns with replayability.  Uncertain if there are multiple paths to victory.  Still am interested in exploring this game more but I'm not certain if I remain interested in attempting to acquire this one.  

Third play keeping it at a 7.  I still enjoy the game, but am fairly convinced that the game will only go 6 rounds at most if at least one player is pushing their production and building with a bit of trade.  Leads me to think there might only be 1-1.5 different methods to victory...

Drops to a 6 where I think it will stay unless playing with one of the expansions changes things.

Edo is just another title in a long string of Euro designs that take the hot mechanic of the day, put it in a different setting, add a small unique mechanic to the mix, and suddenly you have a new game on your hands. Edo does have a few interesting choices while playing, and the rules are relatively easy to learn, but the game is just simply boring. At no point while playing the game did I feel an excitement or engagement. There is minimal player interaction and what little there is doesn't give enough punch to really affect the game positively or negatively. Really, if you have played a worker placement game, you have played this one.

This is an interesting worker placement game where you program three moves ahead of time.  I really like this game.  The programmed moves and tight resource play makes it very interesting.  It is not a long game either in that you are playing to 12 victory points but can go over if you can forecast when the game will end.  The expansion is important as the Shogun's palace seems to be essential to the game as well as the temples and the Ronin.

I like this little worker placement game.  The way you pick your upcoming moves is pretty unique to the games I've played.  I don't like the fact that you have a finite number of extra meeples available for the whole table.  Anyone with a modicum of experience will jump all over those guys before anyone else can.

08/20/13 Played a three-player game in 1.5 hours. 
Edo reminded me a lot of Fresco due to the secret planning and the Do'h! moments later when you discovered you'd planned incorrectly. I was a bit dismayed by the twelve extra authorization tiles one could obtain. The majority seemed "eh". I only noticed 2-3 that seemed even semi-worthwhile. I laughed that the score track went up to 22. For I can't see how anyone could ever achieve that. The graphics and components were adequate. The theme seemed quite pasted on; there was nothing that screamed this was set in 16th century Japan. Overall a bit dry. I'd be willing to play it again, just not too often. 
01/11/14 Played a three-player game in 1.4 hours.

I'm going to give Edo a break. Typically, I'd rate this lower, as my first play was definitely "too long for what it is" (90 to 120 minutes), but my GeekBuddies say it can go as fast as 45 minutes with experienced players, which would make this quite a decent game. Despite the usual process of gathering resources to build stuff and get points, Edo puts a bit of a spin (haha?) on things with simultaneous action selection via some very cleverly designed action tiles. I frequently felt like I wanted to do three specific actions, only to find two of them were on the same tile, forcing me to figure out a makeshift alternative. I wish there was a bit more screwage in this game; yes, some areas can get crowded, hurting your ability to gather resources, but this didn't seem all that intentional. Instead, it just seemed like a dumb error I could have avoided by glancing at what other players needed. The game doesn't seem to be all that hard, so I'd never want to spend two hours on it again, but an hour max wouldn't be so bad. Decent.

Edo is a perfect lunchtime game for euro-gamers.  It easily plays in an hour and the whole game is deeply strategic, interactive, tight and tense.  The board is appealing, the components are thick and sturdy and the game play is top notch.  This is a seriously underrated and overlooked game!  When I play this, I feel like I am playing against the other players rather than playing against the game.

I really like the way action-planning is handled in this game.
Other than that, area majority & workerplacement game with resource management.

This is not really complex, but it is heavy. I like the artwork & theme. Duration as advertised is a straight-up lie :)

It's a good game, but not a great one.

RATING: 7
In medieval Japan, each player starts with three action cards. Each action card has four possible choices of actions, such as get rice, get extra worker, build and so forth. You preprogram your three moves each round and resolve them in player order.

Getting goods requires you to put samurai onto the board, income is collected by houses players have on each area. The game ends when someone gets to 12 VPs, then you finish the round. 

It's a fun game, with lots of tough decisions to make. Looking forward to more plays. My rating is likely to rise with more plays.

May take a few plays to get adjusted to the game; after one play it seemed like you could either build or buy your way to victory, and doing the latter seems like a cheap strategy for games in general. But perhaps a change in mindset is required in this case? More plays would tell the tale. It's a simpler game and set of mechanics than first meets the eye; it doesn't have much agonizing as there never seemed to be a shortage of money.

Is there enough tension in this game? Seems like every turn everyone should do merchant to keep up with the Joneses. I wonder.

Quick resource gathering/building euro with a little hidden action selection. The action selection is nice, and the game doesn't outstay its welcome.

In my one play, the owner happened to be the first player, and got the setup rules wrong - he went first in the package taking/placement. Surprise surprise - he won.

Edo is a litmus test for gamers: distilled Euro. If you self-identify as an Ameritrasher, save some time and move on - Edo is for the others. For Eurogamers, Edo is excellent.

The paper-thin theme concerns the development of Tokyo; players represent the heads of noble families attempting to gain prestige by contributing to development of the city and surrounds. There is no direct conflict, but fierce competition for resources. The game is all about timing - to maximise the effect of your scarce actions, to take precedence, and to end the game before your opponents are ready. Edo is great for strategists who are happy with abstraction. The action selection boards are very clever; there are lots of decisions to make.

Negatives: the rules are difficult to reference, there should be a tile summary for each player, and the cartoony pictures on the player aid are annoying. AP: slow players will be exxtraa slooow.

Worth Mentioning: The board is eye-popping, and the First Player marker is tiny.

Positives: Genuinely deep play, with hard decisions. Several strategies. Variable setup.

節奏比較特別的遊戲
雖然還是行動規畫的產資源換分遊戲
但是因為移動的特殊花錢規則跟行動規畫的不確定性
讓遊戲比較不直觀
基礎可能著重在交易拿分數跟拿資源的效果不錯
蓋建築跟買行動板塊則是看需求
規則:

I'd rate it higher except it's so abstract you could pick the theme up and let it float away on the wind like a feather. The decision making process it provides is engrossing though. Each order card has a different 4 orders on it (get rice/wood/stone, move, build, trade, get more workers, etc) but you can only choose one on each card each turn. So you program your turn, picking one order from each of your 3 order cards. And of course there's multiple things you want to do, and it's a race to build onto the board as the building areas are area majority - most/first on gets most money each turn. And money allows you to build more later. Eventually you'll realise that building isn't enough, you'll probably want to trade goods for points as well. And if you haven't invested a bit in better order cards at the start, perhaps falling a bit behind, you might get swamped by players with more efficient orders later. So there's a bit of a pivot point to work out as well ... how much to invest vs just acquiring/spending for points. It's a heads-down game, played a bit in a sandbox as a result. Games probably feel a bit similar given it's so abstract. And there's no engine to build ... it's just about making your strategic decision on how to get points and investing that way. But it's aim is to be a well-realised program-based Euro, and it succeeds in its aim.

Medium-weight worker-placement resource-management Euro choosing/programming 3 actions in a row (as in RoboRally or Wings of War). Classy game. Excellent feel to gameplay. Challenging. Plays great for 2 players, but even better with more.

Typical gather resources to build stuff euro.  But the action selection mechanic together with the fact that it's a very low scoring game makes this one shine above most of the games it rubs shoulders with.  You really have to time your play well and fight for every point.  Great game that deserves more attention than it gets.

This game reminded me a lot of Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India, except it was nowhere near as difficult. Like in Maharaja, players secretly decide their actions, and then build buildings around the various cities to gain income via area majority. All the cities score each turn though, and money is useful but not tight at all. The real limiting factor is collecting other resources, as you send your pawns around the board to do that and build the buildings. Of course, you have to feed them each turn, too. The actions come in the form of large square tiles--you choose a side of the tile to execute its action, preventing you from using multiple actions on the same tile. You can also acquire new, better tiles, giving you some more interesting choices.

RATING: 7
It's thinky, fast, and Japanese themed. What's not to like? You've only got 3 actions per turn, but it's excruciating trying to figure out which ones you want to do and some of the tiles you want to use for everything. Plays better with more players, but I don't mind it at 2. I do wonder how replayable the game is as the strategy doesn't seem VASTLY different from game to game. I could see this getting a little stale over ~10 games if played in fairly short succession, but then again, I can't seem to get it to the table often. Having the 5 player expansion should help with that by a good margin.

Looking forward to see what the expansion adds to this game to bring it up a notch.

A game I had been looking at for quite a time. Finally found and played. It is a VERY thinking game. I have never been so AP before. DO NOT play this with regularly AP players. I mean there is so much thinking involved my head hurt and I am not a daft player. I am usually right on it. For whatever reason this was a hard game for me. I am interested in revisiting this title since I know I need to give it another chance, but after first play I am not sure this is for me. Really interesting mechanics and I know a lot of people love this but maybe I am too stupid. :P

This is a fun and quick playing hidden action selection, resource management game. It's essentially a race to 12 points, and you get points by collecting resources from the board and then spending those resources on structures in the cities. It's awesome twists are you select three actions secretly from your action tiles, then reveal and resolve one at a time around the table. The resource collection spot diminish in power, the more players that are standing on them, which means you should try to predict your opponents. The expansion added some extra non-player figures who wander around and get in your way. We mostly ignored them. It seemed to add fiddilyness to a game that was otherwise very smooth. The other expansion elements were very enjoyable. I do wish the cities payed out for majority at the end, as the endgame feels a little simple.

A solid medium-light programming game. From reading the rules, I thought there would be deeper strategy involved. Still, I like the way Samurai enter and leave the board and how majorities in the cities sre in constant flux while players race for points. I feel like an advanced mode where the point goal was raised would improve the game, since there didn'y appear to be much drive to purchase upgraded action tiles over simply collecting resources and gold. The expansion adds a few nice twists, but still doesn't quite make this good game into a great game.

This is a fabulous implementation of a simultaneous selection, programmed movement game! Your actions are programmed, but there is still some flexibility when you are taking them. Is the resource area occupied when you need the full amount of goods, then just pay to move to the other one! The points are tight and the game plays fast. It also does have workers that you need to place and acquire to do actions. The samurai are great for increasing your options and allowing for double actions, but it costs you extra upkeep. This is a game that I'd happily play again and I recommend checking out.

RATING: 5
A somewhat dry and yet intriguing exercise in planning. You'll need your thinking cap on as you try and work out how to keep the victory points ticking over to a lowly and quickly achieved 12 point end of game trigger. You'll also need to be good at judging when that trigger will go off so you can deploy as many of your Samuarai as you can for extra victory points.

There's lots of agonising choices how you're going to use your three tiles each turn, all the while dodging other samurai and racing other players to produce and build opportunistic fortresses. So yes, there is a decent level of player interaction. Two player games can be a bit cutthroat as there's only one production space of each resource, so you want to be a bit careful with your production planning when you're not the starting player, or else you might get blocked.

Additional action tiles keep the choices and games fresh, and together with the trader greatly helps with multiple paths to victory.

Games will come in under ten rounds and at under an hour it doesn't outstay its welcome or feel overly repetitive. The simultaneous planning and quick turns keeps it going at a good pace.

Nice components. So so rules - wish they would stop splitting the rules up between the setup sheet and the rulebook.

A good game and a great Kickstarter experience. We're enjoying the learning curve. Despite the pasted on theme this has started to reach the top tier. Games coming in at about an hour long help with our desire to bring it to the table.

(Note to self: Rookie mistake and future game hint - the tile with the trader is the same as the samurai placement action.)
------------------
It'll be interesting to see which will be the best medieval Japanese themed game of 2012, [i]Edo[/i] from Queen Games or [i]Yedo[/i] from eggertspiele. Both sound interesting. Strange... I'd be interested to hear from Queen Games and eggertspiele how they both happened to come up with the respective names and themes both in the same year. I'm sure there's a tale to tell there. I wonder which I will prefer? I'm intrigued, so I'll be ordering both, although Edo's Simultaneous Action Selection is not a mechanic I'm fond of.

RATING: 8
This is a fun game with worker allocation, area control, secret exclusionary action selection -- wow, what does that even mean? Well it means you select what 3 actions you want to take, and because multiple actions are on a 4-sided tile and you select just one side, that means selecting one action excludes the others on that tile from being selected during actions two and three. Worker allocation works with the action selection such that you may be able to do each action more than once. Many actions also require samurai to support it, and these are actually just workers that you sent to tromp out in the fields. Samurai demand a payment of rice to do this job, and also you have to pay their travel expenses. More samurai means less travel expenses, but greater salary. Victory points come from building houses, trading posts, and fortresses, and also from good use of the merchant. Building costs resources but also money, and money comes from the revenue from influence in each city, which is the area control bit. Building resources come from several locations on the board; collecting them requires a samurai, and the more samurai who sit at a collection point the fewer resources everyone gets. I really like this game, it's a nice optimization puzzle.

Average light euro with ok components, nothing special here.  Low replay value due to the game ending quickly which forces players to get stone early and often to build fortresses.  Tremendous luck / king making based on where players build the first houses and the luck of picking an action to produce stone/food/wood after players either have moved their samurai onto those spaces or off of them.  The result can be producing anywhere from 2 to 6 of the resource if you guess wrong or another player takes an unpredictable action.

I first played this just as I was getting into the hobby (and in the midst of Kickstarter frenzy) in 2012. I revisited after several years of gaming experience: it is an ok game. The action selection creates non-thematic and artificial dilemmas. I don't know why this irked me this time around. The same statement could be made for countless other games I rate higher. In the end, I wouldn't mind playing this every now and then, but I can't imagine myself craving it or asking for it over the multitudes of other fine choices. It is a standard, quick, and tight euro. I don't regret selling this. 

5-18-2012 I have a great first impression of the game. It does have a good bit of iconography that isn't intuitive, and some subtle yet important nuances to the rules that take some getting use to. Once you get past these, the game is smooth. The action selection mechanism is really fun (and wonderfully frustrating: Two actions you really want on the same action card, but you can only choose one!). I'll need to play a few more times before I give it a rating.

RATING: 8.7
Components - .8/1 Biggest knock is that the rules are slightly disorganized. They definitely are far from unusable, but do need a little searching for some things. The resources are nice components, the programming tiles are solid, and all the buildings/meeple/etc. are nice. The money/x5 resouce pieces are cheaper cardboard feeling. Definitely much more good than bad.

Fun - 1/1 At the time of this writing I've played almost a dozen times and everyone has been a blast. I've played with about 10 different people and all liked it a lot, even during the learning games. There's enough there to keep you wanting more to play again and see what you can do differently.

Replayability - .9/1 A fair amount of extra tiles (random 5 shown at any time), the market get shuffled, value of the towns varies, and their relation to the resources changes. There's enough to keep the game from getting slate anytime soon.

Strategic - .9/1 There is always decisions to be made, with only three actions per round, so much to do in so little time is the constant feeling. In addition the breakdown of the action cards means that you have plan ahead so you don't end up needing two actions on the same card for a single round. Building is necessary for victory, but watching the market closely can sometimes yield quick boosts to your score on the cheap. The best part is the balancing act of people on the board versus off to manage actions. 

Theme - .6/1 Although the game doesn't drip with theme, when playing it does feel like you're working to develop rural communities. The components and art give enough feeling for the game to score some points with me. 


Personal Opinion - 4.5/5 I really do love this game. There's a little overhead with teaching, as all the symbols need explanation but it's well worth it and isn't too much that several plays are needed. It scales quite well between the two to four player count.

Lots of interesting choices and a really tight economy. I also really like how while what you do is mostly a solitary experience, board position still has a fairly significant effect on your opponents.

RATING: 6
Ostensibly something about medieval Japan, not that you'd notice, except that the VP symbol is "カ". The board is hideous -- a pleasant painting in a traditional style ruined by ugly gem-cities and roads which only need to be shown so prominently because they've been skewed and twisted to disguise the fact that the game is laid out in symmetrical rings. (Can't have it looking like an abstract; it's more "thematic" this way!)

What shines is the dry but fun simultaneous action-selection: turns are planned in three-action batches using square tiles with one action on each side, so some are mutually exclusive. Players can also purchase new action tiles as the game progresses.

The problem is that nothing you can do with your actions is very interesting. With very little blocking, no real scarcity (many different ways to get each of the four resources) and no real conflict -- no real [i]drama[/i]! -- it's just a game of efficiency of action. That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you, and there does seem to be real subtlety there.

What doesn't work for me is the points-based endgame trigger, which encourages a rush: if you're not paying attention, someone can end the game with 5 or 6 victory points in a single turn, in which case they will very likely have an insurmountable advantage. Pre-programmed actions mean that other players probably can't respond. Again, that's not necessarily a bad thing; a tight, short game is nothing to complain about. But because fortresses are the only reliable method for scoring those big points, it does seem to leave the game as a rather one-dimensional race for stone, with other actions required around the edges. This increases the luck factor (timing of market cards and new action cards) and makes the whole thing less interesting than it seemed at first glance.

Extremely dry and abstract Euro that I will probably forget how to play almost instantly due to lack of theme and unmemorable mechanics.  Somehow, though, it was still pretty interesting to play.  Clever play was rewarded, and the endgame had an intriguing twist to it.  It plays quickly, and the programming mechanic can be exciting to see if you can do what you want before someone else gets there.

Programmed actions, with route building for income & VP. Kind of Shogun meets Medieval Merchant. I really like the "choose 1 of 4" action tiles. Calculating income is a bit tedious, though.

RATING: N/A
Interesting changing multi-choice action selection mechanism found in various card-drive games (RfTG, Glory To Rome). Nice spatial maneuvring. Building up your little empire and getting into the way of other players. Or should I say, get out of the way as that is more profitable.. but also for them.

Two downsides: board looks functional but a little bland. It is all function and no chrome, which doesn't help for theme. Second there is no direct interaction besides outmaneuvring each other and compete for influence/resources.

The lack of interaction makes me wonder about the playtime this will get. Though I find it an interesting game, it seems to have huge replayability. Would like to play it to really feel how it goes down. Interesting.

J'ai beaucoup aimé la mécanique de programmation avec le choix des actions. Quelques choix pas évidents. Et les tuiles pour améliorer sa sélection d'actions sont juste bien: pas trop forte tout en offrant un petit bonus. Et la 1ère partie à durée 80 min - le rapprot poids de jeu versus la durée est très bon.

Programmable actions means a lot a agonizing decision, especially when you're new to the game and still trying to figure out how all of the mechanisms fit together. Lots of fun, and doesn't overstay its welcome. My only concern is that there isn't as much interaction with the other players as I'd hoped. That said, with experience, the fighting may become more intense. Time will tell.

Bit of programming, bit of building, but it's actually a race at heart. Feels a bit chaotic too, as there's so many things to do yet it's very tight on points, so it's kinda difficult to cook up a coherent strategy. Rating might improve after more plays.

Is it worker Placement or Action Selection?
Anyway - it's with a twist. Managing not only 3 different Recources and Money, but also deciding weather officials or Samurai are more important at the moment while trying to squeze the best out of your 3 actions per turn summs up to a tight, interesting game.
The board is dense enough to have a game far from multiplayer solitaire. It's a race for the best building spots and the empty recourcefields.

The only gripe could be that with experienced players it could be over very fast. Not that short games are a bad thing, but maybe it could be one of those "just when it really begins, it's already over" Games.

Like to try again soon.

The mechanics are solid but the game was not interesting to play. During our play, we were constantly searching the board for places although the layout is actually quite simple and there are not that many places - so the art is obviously not helpful. I guess we have just seen too many worker placement games, and just connecting actions to locations on a map and the rotating action selection tile mechanic were not enough to satisfy us. 

Very low interaction and even though planning is simultaneously, it feels like long downtime.

This game accomplished several impressive feats in one go: it employs a programming mechanic where you must decide your next 3 moves in advance, it combines resource management with a very rigid worker placement and sustainment mechanic and it has a look and feel which successfully sets it apart from other Euros. I was skeptical after having read the marketing materials and reading the rule book, but I really got into the gameplay. The game is very well balanced. It is very difficult to tell who is winning until the final count. There are many paths to victory and the best path is to diversify. All of these, for me, are elements of a great game.

This game is still an undiscovered gem. One of my current favorite worker placement, Euro-style games.

The simultaneous pre-planning phase moves it along nicely, and although you must pay close attention to your strategy to win, it can be a brain-burner if you let it. This one is in the sweet spot for me.

Good components and great theme are icing on the cake. Everyone in my game group has seemed to enjoy this one and games are always close.

Edo is an interesting worker placement game that gets quite thinky, mainly due to the original action tile mechanic. The tiles make it hard to choose all the actions you need and the level of success you achieve with the selected actions highly depends on the actions that other players select. Even though I like the game, I feel no need to own it, because I did not find it to be particularly innovative otherwise. The way in which majorities are worked out in this game, reminds me a lot of Maharadja, and I find the older game more accessible than Edo is. In fact, I think you definitely need to play this game quite a bit to prevent making mistakes. Not one for casual gamers and a bit dry, Edo is quite a heavy game that is not for everyone.

RATING: 7
Programmed actions in a game system can leave me cold, especially if player actions can be severely diminished or blocked by an opponent's selection. This exercise of frustration is compounded when lack of resource due to inability to execute blocked actions leads to a slow but pre-determined death spiral of non-competitiveness. Roborally, I am looking at you! Edo does not face the same issue even though the main gaming mechanism is programmed action selection. This is largely due to the relative abundance of resources, particularly in obtaining money (Ryo). This is important since money is often required for moving personnel, be it the samurai or the merchant, around the board to different locations for carrying out actions. This can help prevent a complete shutout of resource locations since one can pay a little bit more money to move to another open location. In the worse case scenario, fewer resources are obtained in each shared location as opposed to a complete shutout. I certainly appreciate that aspect of game play as it cuts down on the frustration of guessing your opponents next selection. However, this does mean that the game operates on a more optimization and solitaire-ish level as players can freely move around the board to fulfill their actions with fewer restrictions. I am fine with that. Overall a good to above average game which I am happy to have in my collection.

Solid heavier Euro where you need to plan your 3 actions in advance.  This can lead to some screwage situations but only if you took a risky chance in trying to get something when you weren't the leading player.  It's all about worker placement and action management.  But it plays out rather fast and gives your brain a nice workout.

Nice strategy game with interesting action selection mechanic. I'm not a fan of the "feed/pay your workers" mechanic, though, so it does lose some points for that. I've heard that the game is better with the expansion included, so I'll have to revisit my rating after I try it that way.

In Feudal Japan, we are daimyo competing for the favor of the Shogun by developing the surrounding area of Edo. Secretly pick three ordered actions to be performed by our administrator and samurai to gather food or resources and build. Some screwage here. Big bart of the game here is being one step ahead of the other daimyo. To me this plays like a straight Euro set in Feudal Japan. The mechanics interlock and play well together.  Might be a little plain.

When the rules explanation began, my eyes rolled so far back into my head that my medulla oblongata put on a puppet show to keep me entertained.  I was not ready for another resource management/building game, nor will I ever be.

But [i]Edo[/i] really isn't bad.  Programmed actions force players to pay at least some attention to their opponents' needs and desires - to ensure, minimally, that you aren't sprinting for the same resources at the same time. There is also severe competition for income, which gives the game a combative edge.  

Having scanned the [url=http://www.malz-spiele.de/games_edo_faq.htm]FAQ[/url], the game is also meaner than I thought. On their turn, players can pay to move their samurai or the merchant just to mess with other people.  This can destroy players who are low on cash or who are relying on a massive influx of resources at just the right time.

Finally, it's hard not to recommend a game that has rice grains the size of watermelons.  I don't know what's in the fertilizer across the Pacific Ocean, but I'll take a few drops to supersize my morning pancakes.

Build houses, trading post or temples, collect stone, wood or rice, add meeples to your supply or the board, plus a few other things using a programed turn order. the problem is that you only start with 3 order tiles and each has 4 things on them. You can only do one of the four each turn. The game works very well and is fun for a few plays. I just don't know about replayability.

Planungsmecchanismus neu kombiniert, einzig der Erwerb neuer Aktionsplättchen hat Neuheitswert - es ergibt sich aber kein neues Spiuelgefühl. Ansonsnte Kombi aus bekannten Mechanismen.

Die häufige Planung lässt das Spiel stocken und unterbricht Spielfluss. Zudem hohe Abhängigkeiten durch Aktionene der Mitspieler. Einzelne zusätzliche Aktionskarten zu stark, wenn diese früh kommen (u.a. Stein *2). Spannungsbogen wirkt sich uaf Zug aus, steigert sich mit Spielverlauf jedoch nicht gross.

2012-11-23: The game is not intuitive to pick up, but you'll catch on quickly enough, and then it becomes a game that is challenging to play, but rewards keen observation.  It has healthy hints of a number of favorite games, such as [thing=296]Medieval Merchant[/thing] and [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing], but plenty of its own flavor and texture.  I really look forward to playing this more!

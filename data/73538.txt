RATING: N/A
VERY fun version of FLUXX, probably my favorite. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I truly like this one! Though it's not an actual board game (it's card game!) it's very handy one. Easy to take with to a road trip or to picnic and very amusing! I've been playing this one a lot and every game played is different than the previous! One thing nag about is that after 10 games in a row it starts to feel worn out!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The best version of Fluxx I have played, with a theme that carries through all the cards very well, and sensible actions which make sense based on their titles. That's as thematic and sensible as Fluxx gets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fluxx - again. With a Pirate theme! I don't know why people play this. I guess because it is silly and has some whacky rules to it. And it is very portable. But wow - the game is just chaos. There are zero decisions in the game which makes it tedious and a yawn fest. Couple that with it not able to get off the table when the fun is clearly well over. Bad game. Bad.

I've played a good few games of Pirate Fluxx now and it's a nice light game that gets a lot of laughs amongst my gaming group. It usually comes out either at the end of the evening as a nice round-off game following something more heavy or at the start to get everyone ready.

After a few games it feels time to move on but I don't think it was ever intended to be a game to play over and over repeatedly through an evening and so thats why I think it's good because it knows its place. One definite drawback is the playing speed as new players can take forever to read each card before finally playing something. 

Now I just need to work on my pirate accent because right now it sounds like an angry Irishman!

I think it lacks a little of the flavor that some of the more licensed themes carry, like Batman or Regular Show, but that said, not everyone is going to want to play with those IPs, so Pirate Flux works well as a more generic theme that does honor itself in the mechanics.

RATING: 7
a fun flux game, but I find Zombie Fluxx to be more fun.

note, has a bad card.  "swap all draws and plays... if 'play all' is in affect you can draw as many cards as you can hold".  what a not-fun card.  why would someone *not* pickup the whole deck?

Zombie Fluxx is better.

I know Fluxx doesn't always get a lot of respect on BGG, but I almost always have a good time playing this game. And though there are exception, the games are usually fairly short. Pirate Fluxx's theme is an improvement over the original. I especially like the "Talk Like a Pirate" rule.

Pirates.... again. I love Fluxx and I love Pirate Fluxx. The theme of this one and all of the different cards are awesome.

I like the new suprise cards (Dont see why you couldn't use in your other Fluxx sets). Not much different than other fluxx games other than pirates are cooler than most other themes. Very quick game, great for casual gamers too, nice throw in game between long strategy games and can handle large number of players. Will get old if played all night but can be played atleast once or twice almost every game night.

Who doesn't like pirates?  I really like the addition of surprise cards, and I'm always in favor of more keepers that have some sort of function or additional interaction.  Honestly this is probably the best version of the game from a design standpoint.  Now if they'll just go back and add some of these cardtypes to the vanilla game.

Picked this version of Fluxx to add to our couples night mainly because I thought the ladies would consider Star Fluxx too nerdy. Quick games that went over very well with the group, especially when it broke down into 'Talk Like a Pirate' and other bad accents night. I would like more cards added.

RATING: 3
Any Fluxx variant is still Fluxx, meaning it’s a terrible game! This edition, though, is slightly better than the original due to the new purple cards which make the game more interesting. It’s still a random game which can run too long (and is therefore not even suited as a filler), so I’m not going to suggest playing it and will probably refuse to play it as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Like all Fluxx games, it is fast and easy to learn.  Much fun, great choice for a quick, light-hearted game.

Only bad thing: sometimes people's pirate accents (for one of the cards) are awful and tedious.  That said, that is a very minor deterrent.  Play this game!

Exactly the same as fluxx, a little more bewlidering at times (with all new cards and clever things that make little sense after the first read) but it brings it back with the "talk like a pirate" and the "plunder!" cards, which has everyone laughing and joking.I would try and get these two cards in at most games if able. 

I can play it less than Fluxx (it gets annoying after a while) but it is good fun with new players (as long as those two cards appear ;)

Good quick card game. I see this one as a filler game. We used it in our last gaming session to fill in the time between the longer board games and the dinner arriving. To play this one well you need some experience understanding the different winning card combinations. You will improve your chances of winning significantly by holding card combinations in front of you that meet certain conditions as if you get the right pickup you will win.

I'm liking the themed version of Fluxx, and yet I don't like regular Fluxx. This one is fun, and feels particularly "piratey", allowing the player with the Captain's Hat to throw people in irons or make them walk the plank. When you steal a ship from another player, you feel like a pirate. Good game to theme connection.

This game is just fun. We can while away an evening playing a few rounds. The pirate theme helps, in my opinion, flesh out a very average game. 

Talking like a pirate can be fun, and realistically it is all about screwing the others over. Good fun all round.

"Hey... play until the random win condition happens to pop up for whoever happens to have those conditions filled."  If it was more fun to play, maybe I would excuse this more.  I'll play a Fluxx game only if there aren't any other options available.

Bought this version of flux because its a theme that actually happened, unlike zombies, etc. Thought this would be a goo time killer while waiting for more people to show up. Compact enough to take in a back pack or outside activities. Sometimes the game takes too long. The pink goal cards are irritating. I'm not as crazy about this anymore.

A pirate theme version of Fluxx.  In Fluxx you play cards that change the rules constantly.  I must admit the game was not terrible.  It did not outstay its welcome but it does not seem to be very strategic or tactical.  You simple win by accident.  But I did have fun playing.

Played 13 games in 3 weeks.  Generated a bit of Pirate Fluxx fatigue.

The good:
Fun game, easy to teach, new players can be instantly competitive.  Very accessible.  Silly.  Good in the right circumstances.

The bad:
Difficult to meaningfully influence things although the interrupt cards and some of the action cards help, hard to have a coherent strategy.  A huge amount of luck involved.  Game length can widely vary.  Big advantage for those who have played before and are familiar with the victory conditions.

Verdict: 
Playing this game ain't all about winning.  It can be  fun enough in the right circumstances and works as light filler.

Haven't played any of the other Fluxx versions.  Sold it once I got a copy of guillotine. Then a copy found its way back to me as a trade sweetener.

RATING: 8
Fluxx is one of those games that's perfect for new gamers, because it's fun, throws caution to the wind, and encourages extreme goofiness (in Pirate Fluxx, there's literally  a bonus rule you can implement that rewards you for talking like a pirate).

This can be played as a 2 player game, and stays relatively fresh. You fall in to a bit of a pattern (surprising, since the rules inherently change nearly every other turn), but with minor mods here and there, you can liven it up. 

Everyone ought to have a copy of some *Fluxx game, Pirate or otherwise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Other then talking like a pirate this game is just annoying like most Fluxx games are, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The Fluxx series is chaotic and random but the game is simple; you draw a card and play a card. Once the game starts though the rules can (and will) quickly change.

Pirate Fluxx adds ships, swords, cannons and parrot keepers to the fluxx engine. You can loot your other players to steal their treasures. The highlight for me was the captain's hat. When you have it on the table all the other players have to call you "captain."

It's Fluxx. Not sure why people need several different versions, they're all basically the same. I'm only fine with playing this since it doesn't require and thought and it's usually over quickly. It can offer excuses to be silly, so for that it's great, but not if I'm in the mood for an actual game.

Probably my favourite version of Fluxx so far. The theme is applied quite well (and not too cheesily), not too many creepers to drag the game out ad infinitum, and the surprise cards are a decent addition. But it's still fluxx... meaning that it still "fluxxes" wildly between fun for the first 10 minutes and growing annoyance thereafter.

Fluxx is a very underrated card game and this may be the best implementation of the series.

Pros:

* Well implemented theme.

Cons:

I thought if I love one, I'd love them all, but I hated Cthulhu compared to this one. I can't say if my opinion of this will change once I play other versions, but as of now, I love Pirate Fluxx and I want to play them all!

Only playable as a party / gateway game to get non-boardgamegeeks into the gaming spirit.

While there is some minimal strategy, really it's a lot closer to "4 of Spades Wins!" (wherein you start with a deck of cards and players go around the table drawing one card a turn--first to draw the 4 of Spades wins!) than it is to something like Dominion.  Not my cup of tea, but I can see how others could enjoy it.

Fluxx is a party game at heart, and 4-6 shows it off to its best, chaotic silliness. I've combined Star and Pirate.

It's still Fluxx, but this time you're pirates ... AAARRRRRRRR! Silly fun, with almost no level of control; works OK as long as the game doesn't last too long. Did I get lucky the first time out, or is there a change in the card mix that makes this version end sooner? I don't know -- it's not the kind of game I'm likely to play very often! But that one play was fun enough for me to rate this a 5 -- 2 higher than any other version I've tried so far!

Fluxx with a pirate twist. Getting the Captain's Hat allows you to have a good bit of control, but watch out for Scurvy and Shackles, which will keep you from winning.

Every time I sit down to play a different game of Fluxx, I think to myself, "OK, Isaac, it's not that bad, and it will be over quickly," but somehow I still feel like I have a tension headache from grinding my teeth when it finally ends.  That's not a good sign.  To make matters worse, the designers included interrupt cards, which make the randomness even worse, and the palatability of the game even less.

Not sure what I was expecting, but it's pretty mindless and I'd almost rather just be talking. 

Could be a crowd thing, but for now I'm unimpressed.

A gift from my USA BGG friend, Dion (cowhollow). Thanks very much, Dion.

Instantly my favorite Fluxx!  The suprise cards were a good addition to the game and the plunder made everyone both more hopeful and nervous throughout the game.  In the end its still fluxx and there isn't much more than a big "roll of the bones" to see who wins but there are more opportunities for clever play than the other versions here.

Great filler with a pirate theme.

After 1 Play: Not a big fan of the original, but I'd prefer it, or ideally the Monty Python version.

Fluxx ist ein Spiel, bei dem es null auf Können ankommt, sondern nur aufs Kartenglück. Das mag ich eigentlich gar nicht... aber ich muss zugeben, dass der plötzliche Regelwechsel ganz witzig ist.

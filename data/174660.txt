RATING: 10
An excellent game, beautifully themed.  If you have an interest in turn of the century architecture, this is a must.  But in any case, plays very well, and there are many variations you can use to make the game different or more/less complex based on your mood. 
Lastly, the game's designer has answered many questions about gameplay, rules, and strategy on these boards.

I don't know what to think of my first play, so I will wait to rate it. On one hand it was very light, but on the other I felt there should be some opposing strategies.

In our one play, the person who placed most of the buildings the fastest won quite handily. Seemed too straightforward.

New York 1901 is a top notch gateway game. There are few rules but many stratagies which lead to a smooth design that will not intimidate new players or bore veteran gamers. This is the sort of game that has the potential to make playing a game at a family gathering less painful an experience for a gamer who is sick of settlers of catan or cards against humanity. The artistic design of the board is absolutely stunning and the iconography is not terribly difficult to learn. A great game I would never be disinclined to play.

Played first with two, didn't enjoy it. Subsequent games were with four, and they were okay. It has the same sort of feel of Ticket To Ride, because you can choose to block other players and the end game is player driven - so you are in a sort of race to make sure you get everything done you want to do.

RATING: 6.5
There was a lot of buzz about this game and the art was very appealing. After sitting down and getting to play it I found that it was one of the least entertaining games I've played at all of Gencon. The game left my group feeling underwhelmed, maybe it was the hype. It was a mechanically proficient game, however as each turn passed we grew bored with the game. A lot of people are saying that it's better than Ticket to Ride, but I feel like I enjoy Ticket to Ride more.

Although our group was more into heavier games we still appreciate and enjoy lighter family games, but even this was to light.

This is a pleasant enough family game wherein on your turn, you typically take one of the four exposed property cards, claim that property on the board and place a point scoring building on that property, or wait a few turns later after you claim adjacent properties, and place a higher scoring building on a larger parcel.  

The game also features a handful of "one time use" cards that each player can use to get a little bit more done on a turn, as well as a "tear down and rebuild" with better buildings mechanic.

Moderately fun, this game does not strike me as something I want to play again, but then again, I do respect it as am attractive family game that might be fun for the whole family so to speak. Who doesn't like to build buildings on property?  Cue Monopoly...that sort of thing.

This game has quickly become one of my go to games when playing with anyone new to the hobby. That being said it's by no means a game that can't be enjoyed by heavy or Eurogamers. I myself identify as a Eurogamer, but I'm always happy to see this hit the table.

If I was to point out a negative to the game I would say that the variety is lacking in the end game bonus cards and special buildings. This can cause repetitiveness to set in somewhat, but the complaint is minor and I hope the game remains successful enough to see an expansion of some form.

Good light tile placement in which you're trying to build higher generation skyscrapers for more points, and then demolishing lower generation ones for that purpose. You also get bonus Action cards you can use or keep behind for more points, and there are variable Goal cards that will be out for each session, giving it a fair degree of variation on different plays. Vincent Dutrait art is great and the theme is nice if not saturated into the gameplay. A good one to introduce to fans of stuff like Ticket to Ride since there are a couple similarities.

I've played this at Essen. My question is: why did they show everybody the simplified version of such a simple game? C'mon! They could at least ask the players to choose simple or normal. I bet the normal is about TTR weight while this version I've played is barely a game. Take a card, lay a tile, score points and again...

And now I have to rate it a 4 while there is a chance I might like the normal rules.

RATING: 5
For a family game, New York 1901 is a strong design; it has great components, meaningful decisions, and an abstract building/upgrading system that can be enticing/interesting. 

But when you approach this game from a competitive mindset, I don't find anything particularly deep about the decisions. And worst, I fear that luck may play a prominent role considering how close scores have been.

Thus, this is a game I can enjoy if I don't take it too seriously. But if I spend the effort trying to optimize my decisions, I feel disappointed with the end result.

A fairly straightforward game of developing Manhattan in three eras, trying to make best plays by reserving and building plots along bonus point roads and matching bonus cards.  Worked well.  All three players felt satisfied by the game.  Winner was by three points.  Third player just one further point behind.  Double checked as we realised the final score could be rationalised and audited.  I think all games will necessarily be close hence the necessity of the tie break common buildings.  The only requirement for in-game scoring was to mark when silver and gold building hurdles had been met.  But good to see relative positions.  Would play again,  I think the whole was more than the sum of the parts. A keeper.

A surprisingly interesting game of acquiring plots of land and constructing skyscrapers.  The box and cover may make the game look cartoonish, but the actual game has quite a bit of depth and a lot of interesting strategy.  The changing street and end-game bonuses and the action cards keep the game interesting and virtually ensure that no two games are going to be the same, as your strategy will need to change to take advantage of those bonuses.

That being said, my one complaint is that this game is so dependent on those end-game bonuses that those have determined the winner in every single game we play.  Unlike, say, "Ticket to Ride", where the longest track bonus can be overcome with a strong performance, these bonuses really can't be overcome, as the score will most likely be close until the very end.  So, pay attention to the bonus streets and adjust your strategy accordingly!

I really enjoy this game and its simple mechanisms. I did mess up one rule (which my wife tried to catch before we got started, but I managed to miss it anyways.) Yet the game still worked, and I thought the number of decisions you have to make throughout the game were enough that it felt strategic, but not so numerous that it caused Analysis-Paralysis. Our first game did take longer than I anticipated (certainly longer than it said on the box.) However, as we play more and become comfortable with the rules it is about the right length. This is one game where I feel like the rating might continue to go up as I play it more.

A dull game whose theme development makes no sense, New York 1901 is one of those games that, however simple they are, still yearn to look rich in meaningful strategies and choices but actually have none.

Tt’s nothing more than an abstract puzzle with a pasted-on theme that tries to somehow tie in with Ticket to Ride (illustrations, early 20th century in America, open selection of small cards) and in so doing take advantage of Ticket to Ride’s popularity, although they don’t share anything at all with each other gamewise, as the latter is a great gateway game where different choices are possible and rewarded, while the former is an area control puzzle with a forced gameplay that just makes you find new ways to exploit more and more point sources.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Nothing really new here, and I am not sure why there is hype on this one.  Same weight level as Ticket to ride, but not nearly as interesting as ticket to ride.  Felt like the player going 4th was kind of at a disadvantage, but would need more plays to tell.  Wouldn't mind playing again, but not something I would want to play often.

Super quick tile laying/card drafting city game.  I'm a sucker for city games and this one is pretty damn cool.  By it's decription, it doesn't seem like a ton but there is a lot ways to plan, short and long term, in this nicely produced game.

Can't wait to play it again...my rating is expected to go up.

This is a fun and easy to learn tile placement game. It actually reminds me quite a bit of Ticket to Ride, but I find this game's strategies to be much deeper. Very different experience playing with varying group sizes; with just two it's a bit more roomy on the board, whereas with three it's tighter and far more challenging to secure large plots of land. Blocking becomes more of a thing. The varying bonus cards for scoring at the end of the game add a surprising amount and variation to the game itself, changing up your goals. Gorgeous artwork, and components, super clean design, and very well produced. Even the insert is fantastic! Very much looking forward to playing this more, giving it a try with 4 players, and extremely happy to own it!

So with a game taking 30 minutes, it's hard not to rate it as "Good Game.  Will probably suggest and never turn down."  

It has all the elements I like in short games... players need to balance racing for the finish with satisfying the end game goals.  There's some room for offensive blocking but not too much.  Unlike TtR, the game is too fast to allow for much offensive play.  Instead, offense is controlling the game tempo.  

It may end up being a bit too nice for me (or at least nice beyond the elbow throwing), but I expect it's short enough to get an easy 10+ plays.

Disappointingly bland game in which you pretty much build a skyscraper each turn.  The only limit you have is that you need to own land that matches the building's footprint.  So the main strategy is to buy blocks of land adjacent to each other that allow you to upgrade to larger, better point scoring buildings.  Rinse and repeat until the land deck gives out in a completely underwhelming ending.  It seemed like we all scored about the same amount of points each turn, and small variations determined the winner.  Probably there is a little more to it than that (not much), but I am not inclined to try to find out.

One of my big pet peeves is when board colors are the same as some of the player colors for no logical reason! It makes things a little confusing and means I wouldn't use this game as a gateway game (which is what it is!)

I would play it again if someone wanted to but have no desire to get it myself or seek it out.

New York 1901 is a very fun game with light play decisions. It takes a play through to get the hang of the strategy, but 2nd game was close even up to the end!

Update: Played it, finally, so I can re-instate my integrity, woohoo. TLDR: Exactly what I thought it is. An overhyped solid gateway game, about the same weight as Ticket to Ride, but with fewer interesting decision that the latter. Also, seems to have limited replayability without expansions. Not for me, and from gamers ratings it seems I am not the only one feeling this way..

Does not offer any new mechanisms or elements (spacial placement, point maximisation, multiple majorities, special abilities). With only a few bonus/challenge cards, it seems to have limited replayability. Other than that, a beautiful, easy to play gateway game. Not for me, however.

Very good gateway type game with great options to create a simpler introductory game for new gamers (don't play with the special objective card).

RATING: 4
Not sure why I traded for this. Fairly frustrating on multiple levels. Mostly because new players can fairly easily box themselves into a corner where there only move is a "do nothing" move to undo their previous move. Effectively two moves doing nothing. Also, on most turns (especially early game) you draw a card every turn from a display of cards, like Ticket To Tide, and cards have a color (region on the board), and a size of lot. Lots of size 3 are just way better than lots of size 2. But size 3 cards are far fewer than size 2 cards. It's great if there's a size 3 card on your turn, and sucks if there isn't. Late game it doesn't matter as much, but early game it makes a big difference. I'm not sure why there are size 3 lots at all.

What a surprise. I'd heard that this was a really light gateway game, and the rules didn't make a lot of sense (at first). But then we got to playing and...I like it. Decidedly.

There's some true strategy here, and I often second-guessed my choices. The crazy grab for land, the competition for legendary skyscrapers - good times.

This one moved onto my wish list.

Conclusión - 
En el momento de escribir esta reseña llevo 4 partidas a este juego, y en las 4 he disfrutado mucho. New York 1901 me parece un buen juego ligero-familiar. Cuando te lo explican crees que es una tontá, y de hecho no deja de serlo (en cuanto a complejidad), pero te das cuenta a medida que pasan los turnos que tiene más cosas a tener en cuenta de las que creías. La pugna por las calles y por la carta de Reto estará ahí toda la partida, y después está el elemento de el roce. Crucial en este juego. Como cerca de ti se venga continuamente 1 jugador, o varios de ellos, te joderán de lo lindo, ya que no podrás crecer cuanto quisieras. 
Es por ello que en este juego la planificación de los primeros turnos es esencial. Tienes que tener muy claro qué solares quieres y en cuáles más tarde reconstruirás. Como vayas al tuntún después no te saldrá nada, y resultará que eres tú mismo el que te has pisado. Ya lo decía antes; en NY1901 el orden en que hagas las cosas es parte del éxito.

Las partidas son muy dinámicas, y rápidas. No me cabe duda de que cuando juegues y nadie sea debutante finiquitarás una partida en unos 45-50 min. Y no os sorprenderá si os digo que la calidad de los componentes os tendrá embelesados y será un +1 a la experiencia.

I did not think that another game could nail the feeling I have about Forbidden Island, in that the process of playing is not fun. This one was worse than Forbidden Island.

What an absolute piece of garbage.

You've earned a negative score that will stick until it sells. Okay even after it sells. This game pissed me off.

I won't record a play of this. I do not want to see it in my feed on the top of my profile.

The most recent bad game I played before this was Ophir. You did better than Ophir, but just barely.

I do not play games as bad as these two. I refuse regardless of my playing partner's opinion. I need that right. I'll give her that right also.

This is a good quick game that I will pull out when we don't have a lot of game time, or as a filler.  Plays well at all player counts.  Mechanics feel a little bit like Ticket to Ride.  Very simple to learn!  Strategies seem simplistic at first, but as you dig in, you realize the deeper nuances of the game (ex. the orientation of the tetris-like buildings is extremely important!).

A very nicely designed, and beautifully produced, Euro.  Very simple mechanics see players acquire lots of land in New York, and optionally build skyscrapers on them for points.  As players cross victory point thresholds, older buildings can be demolished to make room for bigger and more valuable points.  Very clean, easy to teach, but some nice decision points.  Keeper.

This game was touted as a TTR gateway game. I can see that in it, although I don't think it will get anywhere near TTR in terms of competing with that status. There is much to like here: simple play, Tetris style piece placement, buying territory, building buildings, area majority, set collection and so forth. 

It all plays smoothly and fairly quickly (you are looking at 60-75 minutes for 4 players) but despite that I don't have a particular urge to play it again soon. TTR has a real tension to it which this lacks.

It does work well as a gateway game and it does work well as a game with gamers, it isn't outstanding but is certainly satisfactory and playable.

New York 1901 is not a terrible game, but it is not one for me.  I was sold on the fact that it was about optimal placement and planning, but really it just boiled down to whether you were lucky enough not to have someone pick up your desired plot cards before your turn came up.  Because of this, it really becomes less about your planning (because sometimes they simply just won't ever be realized) and more about how you can finagle the system to give you a few bumps in the points race.

Like I said, it's not terrible by any means, but by the end of it, I didn't feel like we had done anything meaningful.  I guess for me, the game came off dry and wasn't very engaging.  In fact, everyone's mind was wandering to the point where everyone needed a nudge to take their turn.  I can understand myself disengaging when I'm not finding anything interesting going on, but for the whole table to do it after turn two, well, take that as you will.

2015-11-23 : Very light family style game - it does what it's supposed to do : quick playing and letting people make light tactical choices with a light strategic end-game goal, so you can't fault it for that. You can get hosed by the availability or not of particular cards though, which again is par for the course for this type of game. Totally not my style of game, but it's well-designed, so an ok-game

[b]Rating based on - 5 plays, 2 player[/b]
A card drafting tile placement game that sees you building up the city of New York in 1901. The components are stellar, the artwork is gorgeous (even the back of the gameboard is very well done) and the insert is fabulous. When played with the bonus cards it gives a kind of a Kingdom Builder feel in addition to its Patchwork/Ticket to Ride hybrid feel. The rules are good, but there are a couple of finicky ones you need to keep an eye on. As a nod to the 2 player game, you remove a section of the city (pink) that tightens up the board somewhat. 

Overall it was a fine game to play, and it whiled away the time nicely, but it is a bit too simple for us, the strategies aren't that varied which made the game feel very same-y after only a few plays, and there are not enough streets to make a card expansion viable...maybe an additional side board though? We were able to make it slightly more interesting by putting 2 bonus game end cards in play instead of one, but still it was 'just OK'. It's one of those games I think has potential but is just not quite there yet. It feels very basic...I would say it would be a nice intro to Ticket to Ride. But does Ticket to Ride need an intro? :what: There are games in my collection that are equally beautiful and well produced,  simpler or at the same level of gameplay, carry the same number or more players, and frankly that I'd rather play much more.

The components and the box are just fantastic. The game floats well, and you feel that you do smart actions now and then. It is a gateway game which is easy to bring to the table.
What I like about the gameplay is that you always have the dilemma between building high score skyscrapers or building many skyscrapers (for the bonus points at game end). It is also kind of puzzle to try to make room for your different shaped buildings. There is hard to make a decision whether to acquire land (which you may use later on) or to build right away. What I enjoy the most about this game is the "upgrade mechanism". It is really difficult to find the best order to build your buildings in order to get to build most of your buildings.
I have two complaints about this game. The rules are not good. There are some important rules/examples missing in order to understand how to upgrade your buildings. We played it wrong the first time. The other complaint is that the game is almost too well balanced. It feels like you can't really fail. The scoring is almost too tight. Maybe this is a good thing since it is a gateway game, but I was left with a feeling that it really didn't matter which strategy I chose.
All in all an enjoyable experience.

I've read a lot of people compare this to Ticket to Ride, and the first two times I played Ticket to Ride, I had a "That's all?" feeling about it. After two plays of 1901, I feel the same way, but I'm not motivated to push through and try it a few more times.

For one, it's more puzzley than Ticket to Ride, and when I play a big game this light, I want it to be light. But it's also a better game if you play a bit cut-throat (blocking out expansion opportunities), which - again - is not something I want in a game like this. The worst part is that it doesn't feel as tense to me as the simpler Ticket to Ride.

A 2 seems harsh, but I really don't want to play this again. I'm burned out on Ticket to Ride, but I'd still rather play that.

INITIAL IMPRESSION 

I'm not seeing what the hype is about this game. It's feels a lot like ticket to ride but I think ticket to ride has more explosive moments from the destination scoring. Also tons of expansions to draw from now

This game, I wish there were more bonus scoring opportunities or more interesting ones than just 3 different streets.

It does do a good job of keeping the score spread close for newbie players. There is some depth there with building setups as well

Interesting theme, when New York was really starting to build to the sky. The Golden era of skyscrapers. Theme is fantastic and it depicts some what everything involved in building a skyscraper: purchasing the land, demolishing old buildings, sending workers to build etc. Too bad a game is a bit too simple to be continually interesting. Now it just falls short of grace. The game looks really good, it plays well and it has no serious problems in game-play wise. Perfect modern-day family classic and a gateway game. But that's all it is. Not for true gamers for anything more than occasional fun.

A very interesting tile laying game with similar mechanics to TTR. The components are first rate! The street cards and bonus cards help make the game thinky, while adding value to different building each game. Simple rules and smooth mechanics make it fast and the turns feel natural. Any comparison to TTR(aside from the card drawing mechanic)should end with "It's that much better than..."

RATING: 7
New York 1901 is a fairly-simple game on the surface - almost to the point of coming across as bland - but it hides a surprising bit of depth for what presents itself as a family game. There are a number of tough decisions regarding the best way to acquire points and deny opportunities to others with only a limited number of moves available. It's a certainly not a game that grabs one on the first play, but give it a few games and the investment pays off.

I can't exactly recall what led me to purchase this game but I'm glad that I did! The rules are simple but the gameplay is deceptively deep. It is a game that I'm very happy to introduce to new gamers but have also really enjoyed playing with seasoned gamers who prefer much heavier games. The beginning of the game goes quickly but as the game progresses the decisions get more difficult, particularly when you are deciding what to demolish and rebuild as it might affect your ability to build the Landmarks, your position in street majorities and the end-game bonus challenge. I've played it at all player counts and have enjoyed all my experiences with the game.

遊戲中玩家扮演紐約四大家族，每回合輪流選擇地契占地，建設或是都市更新(升級)，地契的類型影響著玩家的選擇及路線，這是遊戲中最隨機的地方~
每當建設或是升級就能馬上得到板塊上的分數，相當直觀，也很好上手，時間約在一個小時左右，是個輕度的家庭遊戲，很適合8歲以上的玩家或小朋友，遊戲中也提供玩家三張特殊卡，用在關鍵時期也可以讓玩家被卡住時有其他選擇~
精美的配件及容易上手的規則，作為家庭遊戲我覺得讓人有眼睛一亮的感覺

Where are the decisions in this game? I felt like every turn, I had an obvious move, and even an obvious one for the next turn, and then the one after.

Ok filler, but rarely comes off the shelf. Nobody loves it, just like it. Perhaps some house rules or variants could make it a little bit more interesting. Just no tension, not a lot of strategy, and not cute enough to play with young kids. 

I think it's a little overrated. One of the few I disagree with Rahdo on. It's not bad, it's just everyone calls it great. I say it's only good.

I think so many people comparing this to TTR is a huge error.  It's only similarities are a passing resemblance in game weight and, of course, drawing from a series of laid out cards.  The important difference though is if you eliminated the cards entirely from TTR you would undeniably have broken the entire game given it's set collection nature.  In New York 1901, however, eliminating the draw deck of lot cards entirely not only wouldn't break the game but might arguably improve upon it greatly.

Ultimately it seems like it would be much more strategic to be able to just pick any lot, in any district, while still needing to deny opponents and so forth.  Too often it just seems like the options to pick from come up far more ideal for one player than another.  The right zone at the right time really matters as does the 3 sized cards as that's 50% more territory gained at no additional cost (arguably with less flexibility in location chosen).

The scoring of buildings is so tight its almost a pointless part of the game.  End game bonuses far outweigh the small differences gained between players building that this should really be the only focus.

Oddly both my wife and I had the same reaction to it vs. the often compared TTR.  This game actually FEELS lighter by far and as if the game is on auto pilot decision wise.  That said we get that the game is really about trying to control the pacing of the game (Something like how almost every winning strategy goes for Thurn & Taxis for those who know that game well), but ultimately the only part of playing the game that feels satisfying in any way is the act of overbuilding another building or building(s).

Those who have more appropriately compared the game to Arkadia have it right.  That is a more similar, and far far better, game.  And that I think is the problem with New York 1901 for me.  There are far better City Building Games (of all weights), there are far better games with tetris like pieces, there are far better area control games, there are far better gateway games, there are far better light games to play with your children...

Now if you've never played any of those other 'better' games you may well find a game such as New York 1901 groundbreaking and revolutionary.  But, too me, it's sort of like this game is the ultimate example of the perfect '5'.  For what it tries to be it's hard to knock it too seriously and therefore it really doesn't do anything too incorrectly.  But in almost all regards it's just the textbook definition of 'meh'.

Still committing to a couple more plays though (because I like overbuilding) so I rate my desire to play 6.5 though I expect my opinion not to change and hence revise it to a 5 and part with the game.

Picked up at Gen Con 2015 and played it 3-4 times so far. It's easy to teach and simple enough to pull out at casual game nights, but with enough strategy to keep everyone interested (even my friend who tends more towards games like Imperial Assault and Archipelago was pleasantly surprised!). This will definitely get played often.

Not bad, but not great either. This is something I'm glad to play every now and then, but should I own it? Probably not. The biggest issue here is the fiddlyness with the areas and that the game needs different kind of strategies to play. I mean that the game looks more promising that it actually is. But still, this wasn't bad choice for being  'the best strategy game 2015 winner' in Finland.

An abstractish city building game, with rather simple, gateway-level rules that can be taught to families but while in the beginning it feels rather easy, it does have some meat to it in the end with majority bonuses for certain streets and a special bonus for certain achievements (these also make the game replayable). While I never felt very excited during game, it is a fine family game.

A fun game where it is easy to paint yourself into a corner if you don't think ahead.  In short, you secure plots of land and erect buildings, only to tear them down later and put the next age of buildings over their spot.  While this has been out for a while and has received a lot of praise, I only recently encountered it and was pleasantly surprised.  It took a couple run-throughs to nail everything down, but once we got the gist of it, it was quite fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok it's a decent gateway game with some nice spatial aspects, but why all the buzz? Sure it's fun to try to fit pieces tetris style, but this game is almost an abstract without the depth that abstracts usually have (especially how tactical and occasionally luck based the card drafting can be sometimes). I don't see myself altering my basic strategy each time: grab parcels of land to form large continguous patches and preferably near the bonus cities, while blocking off opponents from doing the same. Rush to the end of the game once I have enough land to build everything. Sure there might be slight variation of what I build and where based on which bonus points are available, but it's still going to feel like basically the same experience.

I definitely think this game is best with 4 players. The board is way too open with 3 and the game making it much harder to block other people, and at some point in that 3 player game everyone just stopped grabbing plots completely and just spammed demolish/rebuild.

The game was fun to play and had great production on all the pieces. What I did not like was the end conditions. There are not even turns. So the start player gets to pick first and may get an extra turn. Hard to overcome. Any game where some players get extra turns is an automatic loss of two points in the ratings for me.

One of those rare games that can be enjoyed by both the young and the old. The rules can sound a bit complicated on the first read through, but once you have played a turn or two everything is easy.

Elevated above comparable gateways by the special positioning of the tetris-like buildings on the board, although harder to teach due to slightly fiddly rules.  Still, it looks great on the table, and I would choose it over something like Ticket to Ride or Takenoko.

I've only played this 2-player thus far.  While it was decent, I don't think this shines until you get to 3 or 4 players.  My current rating is assuming it will be a bit better at 3 or 4.  As a strictly 2-player, this would be more like a 6-6.5.  I think this might be 7.5 or higher if I get some plays in at 3 and 4 player counts.

Medium-light game which reminds me of Ticket to Ride a bit. Beautiful old-style components with old buildings of my favorite city New York. In the beginning it seems like a very light game and everyone keeps about the same score but when the play progresses, it gets more tight and everything you do, does matter eventually. Nice!

Lucky enough to pick up a copy at Gencon.  We are really enjoying this game.  It is a beautiful game and the strategy is simple enough for the older kids and yet deep enough for the more serious gamers in the house to have fun.  I love how it is puzzle-ish and I also love the attention to historical detail with the map and the skyscrapers.  I am very pleased to have this in my collection.

An easy to learn tile placement game. It could use a hidden goal to score more points. As is, with all the scoring possibilities public information, it makes the final tally rather anti-climatic.

Best part of the game was opening the box. I loved that the cardboard pieces were pre-punched and bagged. Everything fit very nicely into the box and it makes set-up and clean-up time a breeze.

Nice production, but I felt no tension playing this one. Even with a full compliment of players, I was always able to do what I wanted, and I found the drafting of two-space lots jarring compared to the odd shapes of some skyscrapers. I just went through the motions the whole game. Not my style of game, and not compelled to play again.

Deceiving game.  On the surface, this looks fairly straightforward, but there is more here than first meets the eye.  Abstract game that can be played easily enough as a gateway game, but it is more of a mental exercise than your typical gateway game (i.e. Ticket to Ride).  I do like it.

I had written this one off after watching quite a bit of coverage on it. The theme just wasn't that exciting to me. BUT now that I've watched the GAMENIGHT! gang play this I've had a change of heart. I do like tile-laying games and this one does have a great Tetris puzzle aspect to it and the pace is really fast.

RATING: 4
The first game that comes to mind if I allow myself a comparison would be Arkadia. I only played one time New York in 1901, but I would say that Arkadia is more thrilling to play.

The comparison between the games is probably due to the varying shapes of pieces, the workers placement and the "market of cards". Obviously, both games have features that are their own: in particular the scoring system and, in NY 1901, special cards...

There is my problem: I felt with New York in 1901 we were a little too dependent of the cards available. I know that it's premature to give an analysis, but I feel that in NY 1901, we can establish a "good" strategy but get beaten by chance of the game. Moreover, the game left me with the impression that it's better to build in a same region to facilitate further improvements, but again, that depends on the cards that will be accessible in our turn.

About this remark, I would like to have the opinion of players who played several games.

The material is good but I would have preferred different height for distinguishing the buildings of the three "eras" easily. In addition to the aesthetic side, it would ease the game play for the bonus awarded to the player with a majority of buildings in play each of the three eras...

Good game. Eh? Color scheme is not too good. The dark borders had us straining visually from time to time. The players all had the same buildings to score with; unfortunately, this made the game tight in points in a negative way. End game scoring is the only edge a player seems to have.

Overall, I think that New York 1901 has quite a few good things going for it. A nice art style, reasonably intuitive game design, and some well-designed game pieces. For me, the main problem with New York is that it seems to float in a very strange space between a light pick-up game and a more complex strategy game, so I find it difficult to slot it in my main stable of regular board games. I've just never really found a group that found it entirely satisfying to play.

At first I thought it was going to be similar to Arkadia...than I read the rules and thought it was going to be similar to Lords of Vegas...and it has some thoughts from both games, but it is a different play for certain.

Keep in mind that this is a gateway game, like Ticket to Ride, and thinking along those lines, this is a fun game.

This game was an immediate hit with our group, and it's only gotten better with more plays. Laying down tiles may be simple, but planning ahead for future demolitions while monitoring one's success at the varying end-game goals gives players plenty to chew on. I put this in the "instant classic" category.

RATING: 6.4
Visually attractive, great graphic design, component quality is good. It’s an abstract game, but maybe because of the good looks, some of the theme remains. 

It’s a light family game but it has a bit of an extra that will make veteran gamers win more often than not.

The gameplay is fluid and fun. There's few down time and you can always use it to check your remaining buildings and how things are going on the board. The filling of the board makes for some tension, hoping your rivals won't fill the spot you need. And the 1 hour duration is optimal too.

But it has a few details that spoil it for me (in order from more to less importance):
A) The confrontations do not work well. As in many other games, the player who stays away from confrontations/is left more on his own will win. It's easy to damage other players greatly, and since the damage will be considerable, retaliation should be expected.
B) The endgame has not been polished well enough:
-> The last player to play has a potentially game winning advantage, because of the majorities. And he does nothing to deserve it, he just happened to be at the right side of the player who triggered the endgame.
-> Triggering the endgame should be rewarded (or at least not punished); it means you have performed well and maximized your moves. Instead, you are punished by allowing all the other players an extra turn; that means all the other players will get a chance to influence the majorities after you.
C) Being second/third/fourth in play order is a disadvantage that is not compensated in any way.

C) is more of annoyance, but A) is a quite serious issue for me, because it creates very random games. B) Encourages players to "play bad" during the final turns to avoid triggering the endgame, and that is something that feels very unnatural and certainly is not pleasing.

It's still a satisfactory experience and I won't turn down a game, but I won't suggest it.

[b]New York 1901[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]For me this game has stood the test of time since I am always willing to play it. However; my family and gaming friends are not as enamored with the game as I am. After not getting it to the table for 6 months I decided to sell my copy. Still a game I'd recommend for families, especially if you're looking for a great gateway game that is as simple rules wise as Ticket to Ride.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- This game has a great pace to it and ends at the right time (you still want to do more, but at the same time you feel like you accomplished something).
- Variable end game goals (both street and bonus cards) add variety and can significantly alter how you play the game.
- Features the amazing artwork of Vincent Dutrait (quickly becoming my favorite illustrator).

I was weary of the hype with 1901 and my recent track record of new acquisitions hasn't been too hot, but I saw it for a great price and decided to buy it. I've only had it for about 2 weeks, but so far I am quite impressed. NY 1901 seems like it may pull off what TTR has done, which is create a gateway style game that also appeals to folks like me that also enjoy heavier games.

This game seems relatively easy at first, but there is a race element to the game that isn't apparent at first that really drives how you play. You need to watch how your opponent(2) are playing and react accordingly, you always need to be aware of the pace of the game and make sure you do what you need to in order to score buildings and the end game scoring cards. I'm really looking forward to more plays of NY 1901, especially on a family game night. 

Includes the Flatiron promo with the all the new cards.[/i]

New York 1901 has the simplicity of Ticket to Ride.  Players are taking cards from a public display of cards and using them to claim space on the board and build their empire.  The mechanisms are super simple, but make for a great game every time.  Playing for area majorities on different streets makes some areas valuable and others more open to building gigantic super buildings.  The end-game bonus cards give you a reason to keep certain buildings on the board, which can frustrate you in the right kind of way.  PERFECT family plus game!

RATING: 6
A fairly pedestrian affair of using cards from a draft to put out tiles to the board (the cards say on what colour and how big), and then using later turns to replace those smaller tiles with bigger and higher scoring tiles. The only interaction is who claims what spots first, plus some competitions for most tiles along a few of the streets. There's some planning to do along the way on what buildings you don't plan to demolish (so they'll be counted in the street competitions) vs what you plan to demolish. And there's some luck in hoping the cards in the colour you want are generally available to you most turns. But there's no zing and there's little zap. While I didn't mind playing, and it worked fine for what it is, one couldn't escape the feeling that I'd played the game before in various forms, and that there wasn't anything here to hook me into another playing.

A gorgeously designed light strategy game the entire family will enjoy. Avoid playing with AP prone players as they can take something that should be light and fun and turn it into a grind.

Pros:
* Beautiful artwork and graphic design.
* High quality components.

Cons:
* [b]-1 for a lack of enough male characters for a 4-player game forcing someone to play as a female. Why did they not make all the player cards reversible with a male and female on either side?[/b]
* -1 for tying the character cards and colors to the same starting positions in the basic game and requiring them be dealt randomly. This ruins a player's enjoyment of being able to use their favorite color.
* AP prone players can ruin the game.
* Street bonuses are over powered and a requirement to be able to win.

This is a short euro game where players use cards from a faceup display to claim areas on the map of NY, where they will then be able to build their building tiles and score points. You can also chose to remove your older buildings instead of taking a card, in order to have room to place some of the larger buildings. There's a reasonable amount of blocking options, as players nudge into the regions their opponents are trying to block off for themselves. There are also two endgame bonus cards available each game, which changes up people's strategies some, adding replayability. The art and components are very well done, and I enjoyed this game a lot.

Most of the complexity of the choices is based on the geography of the board, and which special goals are in play for that game. Some combinations of those goals can make the game a bit frustrating though, by encouraging players to go against the usual tempo of the game (like incentivizing everyone to not demolish their Bronze buildings), which can cause an awkward and drawn-out endgame.

A fairly light game with some set collection, tile laying, puzzle aspects. 
You have a limited set of actions so a turn is straight forward. You acquire cards that lead to land that allows you to build builders then replace them with larger more complex layouts. Getting the land and buildings together exercises a spatial niche. Bonuses are scored based area control of various points on the board.
A good family level game. The pieces and tiles are very well done.

You build by choosing one of four face-up cards.  This makes the game so limiting and random that I really don't want to play again.  I would - it's not horrible - but there are many better games out there.  I think the game would be much better if each player were dealt a hand of cards so that he could actually plan his moves.  As it is, you just sit there impatiently waiting for your turn - and being bored out of your mind.

RATING: 6.8
Summary: light, simple, entertaining. I feel Kingdom Builder does it better, but my wife likes this one.

Pros:
* Scales down to 2 well enough. The area control aspect is both minor and restricted by random card draws so it feels less tit-for-tat than many other area control games with 2 players.
* Ok level of interaction between players (blocking or otherwise constraining where an opponent can build; a bit of "hate drafting"; control over game end condition; area control).

Cons:
* The insert just barely fits the components, which makes cleanup take longer than it needs to. Might toss it.
* The rule book has some unclear phrasing (there's a newer version which clears a few things up).

Neutral:
* While the interaction can be fun and cut-throat, because one of the end-game triggers is getting down to only four buildings, too much blocking may fragment the parcels and possibly cause the game to drag on. Putting this in "neutral" because it kind of feels like you'd have to go out of your way to cause that to happen.

= 2016-06-22 - R:6.8

Finally played by the right rules last night. Maybe it's because the game is so simple or maybe it's legitimate issues with the 1st printing rules, but there were so many little things we kept getting wrong:
* We played that you can't Demo/Rebuild on top of a parcel with a worker still on it. Turns out you can (and this was clarified in the updated rules).
* We played that you couldn't build on the same parcel you just claimed this turn. You can (and it was clarified in the updated rules).
* Somehow we missed that the building tiles were double sided!

A light and simple game. My wife really likes this one. I'm still not sure. In the set of "filler level games where you draw a card to determine where you can build and then cover the map with your pieces, hoping to earn bonuses for scoring cards that change every game", I think I prefer Kingdom Builder.

RATING: 6.5
I'm seriously considering this for my non-gamer friends. Very simple rules, quick playing time, straightforward but non-trivial strategies, very appealing theme (one of my non-gamer friends loves city building), and familiar mechanisms (everyone seems to love Tetris-esque pieces).

However, for city building for non-gamers, I'd rather point them to Carcassonne. For a card drafting game, Ticket to Ride is more interesting. 

In Carcassonne, the different building elements have more character; each element is built and scored differently. In New York 1901, building vary just by shape and when you can build them. Ticket to Ride just has more tension; it takes more work to accomplish objectives in that game.

Still, game play is really quick (I think quicker than either Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride) and polyominoes are always fun to play with!

Excellent game with great pace, no time out. Easy rules but not short in strategies. Takes a few games to really get all the depth, do not over look it as "not challenging enough", you would be missing out on a great game that newbies and "veterans" will enjoy as well.

To top it off, this game is an eye candy, from token to the box, no corners were cut short.

Ticket to Ride: New York buildings edition. Too much of the game relies on your opponents not accidentally stepping on your toes. In the end, the winner is the person who happened to have the right cards show up on their turn and got messed with the least. It's a great looking game, but that's about it.

RATING: 8.31
Played one game.  You claim parcels of land on NYC streets, and then you build buildings (the bigger the building, the more points you score).  Key rule, you can't claim a parcel and build on that parcel in the same turn.  Also, instead of claiming a parcel, you can demolish one of your existing buildings to upgrade it for add'l points on the same plot(s) of land.

At the end of the game there are bonus points (area control style) for the most building on 3 streets.  In our one game, this bonus was an EXTREMELY important part of determining the winner.   

Over all a good concept for a game...and very nicely produced.

The game is a race to 50 points, but then everyone (except the player who got to 50 first) has a chance to catch up.  So you may have the situation (as we did) of everyone parking in the high 40s.  In our 4P game, the player who passed 50 first came in last place.

It's fun.  Really fun.  There are a lot of decisions to be made.  The game changes a lot depending on how disruptive players want to be.  If you all just play in your little corner it's TOTALLY different than if you start blocking each other.

I love spacial intelligence games, and this is one with great components, a colorful and vibrant table presence, and easy to teach/learn.  I highly recommend it.

Rule book is definitely a downer on this game. Simple mechanics and quick pace lead this game to be a great two player game. I find that it was just hard to understand what your possible actions are on your turn. Which there are only two of.... and if that was hard to explain it kinda hurts trying to teach the game without having played it before. Think that it is a great game and one that will come out when the family comes and visits because it is very pretty fast paced and lots of fun.

A pretty fast light to mid-weight game that can get puzzley as you trying to fit all your building on the board while also trying to score points at the end of the game with the various bonus cards.

Perfectly pleasant, run-of-the-mill light game. Too light for most, New York 1901 needs to be played quick--get the whole thing in and out of the box in under 45 minutes--or it begins to overstay the welcome. There aren't enough interesting decisions to warrant a longer sit.

I like reading the reviews and comments that this will compete with a game like Ticket to Ride in the gateway space. The whole thing about games right now is that there is such an avalanche of new ones all the time, that the situation is that nothing stands out (New York 1901 certainly doesn't). So always new games are getting tried, and every play starts out with a teach...

Only Splendor, in recent memory, has managed to overcome this hurdle. New York 1901 is just another in a seemingly endless series of disposable games that will be discarded like the rest as players search out the elusive Grail.

UPDATE, looking back on this comment, I think I pretty much nailed it.

Along with GenCon promo including extra building tile, player action and characters.


1play: Very nice..the rules are simple, gameplay is elegant and there's a couple of things to think about. The open market always brings forth four cards to choose from. Such cards will allow you to reserve lots of land matching the color/pattern of said card. Then you can build something on a lot that you reserved on your previous round. You can also demolish and rebuild, but if you do that you cannot choose a card to make a reservation on that turn. There's some things to consider when demolishing, and there's an aspect of timing and possible bonus point if one specific character bonus goal comes out for that game. It all works really nicely, played well with 2p, fast, and the artwork and components are top tier. There's also four actions that every player has at his/her disposal, that you can use once in the game. And they're pretty powerful so it's a lot of fun. There's also a lot of replay value since starting set ups can vary based on 3 area goals (of 5) and 1 Bonus goal (of 10, in my case since I got the GenCon promo, the base game brings only 5).  My only two complains so far are that the game is super light, for this type of gameplay (for my taste anyways). Also the luck of the draw on the market cards is pretty obvious at times. I wish that a little more work would be required to obtain certain sections, instead of just being at the right place at the right time. I do get that it's a family game and some randomness is mandatory here, so it's all good. However this game will be a smashing success without a shadow of a doubt, so looking forward to the inevitable future expansions :)-

Gen Con 2015 buy. Have really enjoyed this with family and gaming neighbors. Easy to learn, beautiful to look at, and certainly has some tough decision making despite the gateway mechanics. Will be playing this in many of my different gaming circles. Maybe someday I'll even win! I suffer from the teach a game and lose it syndrome here yet again. Just makes me want to play it more to figure out the bit of the puzzle I must be missing. Thank you Chenier for such an eye popping and great game!

My version also came with a gorgeous signed poster which I need to get a frame for and 3 turn of the century postcards featuring buildings used in the game. They are stored in the game box of course and make for great conversation during  unboxing and set up with each new group.

Several uncatalogued plays.

I am not the target market for big box gateway games, but this is somewhat alright for its genre. Players use cards to reserve lots and score points for any skyscrapers built. The building majority subgame gels well with the Tetris-like tile placement, as creative tile placement or an ill-considered demolition could make all the difference in winning a majority. 

However, there's a special sort of tension missing here – like the tension of completing and revealing route cards in [thing=9209][/thing] – and the gameplay feels routine as a result. Also, I find the rules for power cards a little finicky for a family game. It's not the next big thing in family gaming by a long shot, but at least it gets the job done.

1 play, 4er

A nice light to middle-weight tile-placement, area-control-ish (not really) game. Not for people with spatial reasoning problems!

Players turns are simple: EITHER claim a lot (face up cards on display) and optionally build on one of your owned lots, OR demolish 1+ of your older buildings to replace with a higher-tech (bronze/silver/gold) building. Every time you place a building, you score VP (and silver/gold techs become available when you pass certain VP thresholds). The buildings are in various Tetris-y shapes, with more VP coming from buildings with larger footprints. Everyone also has 3 single-use cards to play during the game, which give you either an extra build or extra lot, or allow you to flush the display of lot cards.

The game end triggers when either a player is down to 4 unbuilt tiles, or you cannot replenish the display of lot cards; every OTHER player gets a final turn. Then, score end-game VP:
- 1 per unused action card
- 5 to the player with the most buildings along the three streets (randomly chosen at start of game)
- possible VP from the bonus character card, also chosen during setup

Despite the simple rules, you have to think about your plan: which lots to acquire, which buildings to use up (once some shapes are gone, your tiles are harder to place!), how much time you have before someone triggers the end of the game, etc. Pretty fun game, although doubt it'll be a winner in the long run.

Played with a mix of the general rules and expert variant rules. It still seemed a bit too light so using only the expert variant rules might make it better.

Kudos for the original game with simple gameplay and not just a rehash of worker placement, deck building or combos game.
The production and art is really good though a little drab.

Now on the bad side, this doesn't perfectly fits the family genre for me. Too much nitpicking and exception in the rules for that. Plus situation where you could actually skip your turn! The gameplay is not as accessible (to non gamer obviously) as you would think with long term building planning and visual pattern recognition as necessary skills to perform well. Lots of chance to screw yourself in corners and running of small building to dig you out.
And the scoring is really lackluster as the point spread between building is too thin and everybody has the same buildings. So everything is decided on the scoring cards which are your run of the mill majority like street, type, etc.

Good original game, but replay value is too low for me.

A good entry-level game with enough going on to make it enjoyable. I enjoy the varied scoring mechanics, and making choices about where and which buildings to place in order to maximize my score. The game is easy to teach with pleasing components and generally should come in at no more than an hour of play time, with reasonable players.

While it's possible for each player to pretty much do their own thing, there's plenty of room to get in each others way; either by vying for building majority on a contested street or simply by buying up a plot of land to break up that large section upon which your opponent was hoping to build a prestige building.

Game is okay for what it is. The reason I gave it such a low score is for a weird rule in the game. It says "on the off chance this happens ... you basically lose." It seems weird to have a rule where if you can't place a building and have all workers on the board you have to waste a whole turn removing someone. You're already behind for not building, why double penalize you? Just seems weird to me to have this one semi-exception rule that can completely screw someone over if they mess up a move. Besides that if there was a fix the game is probably like a 6 to 7 or something.

Each play I like this simple game a bit more. Excellent family-weight strategy, with mechanisms similar enough to other "gateway" games that it is generally easy to teach. Surprising depth of strategy for a lighter game, can also be quite cutthroat with a certain crowd.

Given that this is a medium weight game, it plays exceptionally well. I think my favorite player count will be four, as that will lead to the most congestion on the board, and therefore the most opportunity for strategic play.

I really enjoy this game. It is similar to Ticket to Ride and Castles of Mad Von Ludwig combined. You build buildings in the attempt to gain the most points based on the point value of the buildings. There is some strategy as to where you place your buildings and some special conditions that can earn you more points if met. I highly recommend giving it a shot if you Like the other two games I mentioned.

Traded in Jan. 21, 2017. Just want doing it for me. Ultimately felt bland. It's fine for what it is. It just didn't tickle me. 

Original comment: Pretty neat lightweight gateway game. Shannon likes it OK, so that's a plus. Neat art and simple rules. I'm not sure it's really better than Ticket to Ride, as some have suggested, but I like it and am satisfied having this and not TtR.

Old school german design: fall behind and stay behind. It's straight-forward with a little end-game scoring. And the cut-throat level is high or low depending on your group's playstyle. Mainly, it's not terrible, just boring.

The card line mechanic here is so random and frustrating.

Wanted to really like it, ended up feeling very 'meh'.  Everyone ended up building pretty much all their buildings, so it just ended up being "build your last most expensive building" at the end.
Also just a bit overly complex for what you get.
+1 on the artwork on the board, it's beautiful.

I had the opportunity to demo New York 1901 at Gen Con and to speak at length with its designer, Chénier. The game looks beautiful, was easy to learn, and has a solid amount of depth.

I've found for many of the best games, when you immediately finish your first playthrough, you're left with that "aah, next time I'm going to try THIS" feeling. New York 1901 certainly delivered on that front. The mechanics are straight-forward yet lend themselves to a good amount of tactics and strategy.

I look forward to owning a copy of my own, and anticipate using New York 1901 as a gateway to "hook" non-gamers as well as entertain my seasoned game group!

RATING: 7
Interesting game, that grows on you with plays.  I like the variable common bonus that can be one of 5 different bonuses to go after, changes the strategies each time based on the card, also the variable street bonuses.  Makes the replay ability of this mid weight gateway game better.

However it can suffer from too much AP in games with the bonuses, so if playing with new players you might not want to use them, even though I would not play it without.  

So based on the fact that this game can take 2 hours with AP prone players... (And it really shouldn't be that way),  It is a 7, instead of an 8.

Still worth it, and should be owned, by the game collector.

This is very charming game!  It will likely be my first suggestion when playing with people who don't have much experience with Euros but are up to taking on a little more challenge.  I think it loses its replayability quickly with two, haven't played enough with 3-4 to know how long it will stay fresh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple and fun light game. I prefer this to Ticket to Ride with casual gamers because of the spatial aspect of this game and its level of interaction. The game is remarkably good with only two players. The zero sum nature of it adds to the player interaction in a good way in that it makes interference more worthwhile.

Simply baffled by the popularity of this game.  After three plays I couldn't get beyond how simplistic it felt.  Was honestly bored and couldn't wait for the games to be over. Kept playing thinking I must be missing something.

This is a game I think deserves a spot in virtually every collection.  It is right up there with Ticket to Ride as a gateway game for us.  It's easy to teach but the difficulty can be scaled based on what rules/cards you play with.  We don't us the bonus cards when first teaching someone so that they only have to focus on streets and building in general.  There are a lot of ways to score points here for a game that seems fairly simple.  You can focus just on building your highest point buildings and scoring a big legendary skyscraper, or you can try to win the street or bonus objectives.  (Balancing all also works pretty well, too.)  It can also turn into a bit of a "take-that" game.  If you know your opponent needs a certain space to build what they're working toward, you can try to take it before they do.  Overall, it feels like a really well-balanced game, much in the vein of TTR.  If you like TTR, you will probably like this.

This is one of my favorite gateway games and it at last fills the space in my collection where Ticket to Ride fits with most others. It looks stunning, I enjoy the Tetris like aspect of the game and you can never be totally blocked because you can always destroy your buildings to raise new ones.

RATING: 5
Interesting game with more strategy than is initially apparent. Choosing when to stop grabbing land and start building over your old buildings repeatedly is unique, if unthematic. Lack of flexibility in ownership of lots strikes me as particularly odd. That being said, a solid gateway and family-weight game with enough crunch for hobbyists.

Rating base on just 1 play. I didn't like a lot about the starter rules, but looked at the regular rules and think this game has could easily move up to an 8.

Gateway area control using tile placement and card draft. Real estate moguls acquiring land and building the grandest buildings at the most desirable street locations in Manhattan during the 1900's.

Go through 3 building ages, choose whether to demolish your old city blocks to erect bigger and newer skyscrapers.

Preliminary rating while waiting for more plays. I like this game, but I didn't find myself enjoying the game mechanisms much. They´re okay but I´m having troubles explaining them to other people for lack of understanding. For instance, there are two actions to choose from there are clear overlaps between these (building) and conditions to meet (can't buy a lot if you don't have any workers left etc). Placement rules are not very well written and I had to read these many times to try to make sense of them. For instance it says nowhere you have to own the lot for every space taken by the building, which I think is kind of the most essential rule. There is also confusion about what is a terrain and what is a "lot" (the basic square). Most of that stuff is common sense but I wish it was made very clear in the rules so I would have avoided a lot of time re-reading the rules and checking we didn't do wrong all the time. Then my other complaint is that you basically leave a huge % of the map with no skyscrapers because of the bonus cards. It makes the game very cutthroat, which is even more aggravated by the fact the game ends quickly and abruptly by a player having 4 buildings left. I still do like the game and feel like it can get a better rating than 7 from me but I´ll have to play it more.

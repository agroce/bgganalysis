RATING: 7
Great dexterity game that never fails to impress. Short, simple, yet enjoyable and somewhat fascinating (some of the faces you see when you set it up the first time are priceless). Other plays will easily follow the first one and till now it's been an unfailing gateway game. Of course, it's not a game of great depth and you can't expect to play it over and over, but, every once in a while, it's always a good filler.

Simple but well crafted components. The plate can be a bit annoying to set up at first, but you'll soon discover the way to make it easier.

A fun dexterity-ish game.  The platter has a lot of give - it can tilt pretty far before it topples - so there's a little strategy and technique.  I managed to use the slide-the-piece-without-touching-the-platter technique to my advantage.  Not one I'd play too often, but I liked it.

Takes patience and a very steady hand - but an awesome balance game for people who want go really get into it, fun and exciting to watch the board tilt far to the side without tipping if you're careful.  Gotta be able to walk all around the board and get in the right position to remove each piece.  Can be very competitive with the right group.  Just shy of an 7 because the game can be a disaster (keep falling down) if people aren't in the right mood (or don't have a steady hand)...it's the nature of the genre this game is in, but this game is more of a risk than others.

It's a real trick to get that plate to balance on top of that cork ball!  Although fun and easy to hook non-gamers with, this game can be noisy and messy and not suitable for many venues.  Hamster Wheel is definitely more of a favorite in this vein of wooden shape dexterity games.

Es un juego de habilidad. Se colocan un montón de figuras de madera de diferentes tamaños y densidades sobre un disco y este se deja en equilibro sobre una bola posada en un pivote. El juego consiste en ir quitando piezas por turnos hasta que uno provoca que todo se venga abajo. Está entrenido y se consiguen situaciones de equilibrio realmente llamativas. 

Las partidas vienen a durar cinco minutos, así que se pueden echar muchas en una sola tanda.

There are some physical issues with the game (like, finding a stable table that nobody is going to bump or shake - preferably one nobody else is gaming on), but if you can get past that this is my second-favorite dexterity game (behind Carabande, of course). Enough strategy and judgement involved in selecting a piece to remove to make it a real game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the more fun dexterity games around!  The premise is simple... put a bunch of different shaped and weighted wooden pieces on a big wooden plate, and then balance that plate on a pedestal.  Then, take turns removing pieces from the plate without tipping the whole thing over.

This game really shines when using the weighted scoring system.  With this method, everyone puts the pieces they were able to removed on a digital scale, and the weight in grams is their score.  First to 200 grams wins!  This really improves the game (the boring rules just give 1 point per piece), as the boring rules make it so that everyone just goes after the easiest piece to remove.  The weighted rules mean you want to get the pieces that weigh the most, making the decisions more difficult!

This is a pretty fun dexterity/party game in which the gimmick is balancing a "platter" of Bausack-style pieces on a cork ball atop a wooden stand.  In a teams variant, two members of the same team have to simultaneously remove pieces without the thing tipping over.  It's a good-looking game, but maybe not my first choice for dexterity games.

Dexterity games aren't my cup-o-tea, but even in that category, I particularly dislike games that suffer from accidental table knocks. And this one of them.

But really, who cares. Play something else.

RATING: 8
Crazy, addictive game.  Players take turns trying to pluck wooden shaped blocks off a platter without the platter dislodging.  The platter balances upon a cork ball, and the ball is on a pedestal.  As pieces are removed, some wild tilting of the platter occurs, held in place by the friction of the ball and platter.  Players may hand in a piece already taken to "pass", and thus avoid a penalty for collapsing the platter.  We prefer to score based on weight rather than number of pieces.  I painted the weight of each piece on the piece itself, which adds a bit of depth to the game play.  Caution: do not play on a windy day with windows open!

RATING: 5
Bamboleo is an attractive piece of art, and I mean that if you set it up and let it sit there, people will stop by and ask you about it.  That's a big plus for a game of this type, especially considering that it's a great way to rope someone into trying it out.

As it stands, though, it's a decent challenge, but nothing that I would want to put into my collection or feel the need to play.  If you're prone to hosting parties, putting it out there as an icebreaker would work wonders, but I dunno, how many times can you laugh at someone screwing it up?

Like 52-pick-up, it's funny until you remember you have to clean it all up.

Our first try was very discouraging. We were hardly able to pick-up 10 pieces before the whole thing collapse. After several turns, most players had negative points. We didn't even finished the game. Now, we do much better. I believe the problem was that we interpreted the rules too literally. Our setup was always in the form of a "crown", all the pieces being near the edge.

Now it has become a classic. But it definitely has to be played with the "weight" variant. It add a greediness aspect to it that makes it tense. Otherwise, the game would be slightly boring.

Bamboleo does "balance analysis" in quite a tense and aesthetically-pleasing way.  "Will the size and position of this piece once removed cause too much of a shift?"  Sometimes decisions were obvious while others were a bit tricky.  However, it's a bit funny as a dexterity game because a player's dexterity skills take a back-seat to their ability to analyze position.  This is the tough part; the dexterity part even a child could do (remove a piece).  In that, I don't think it really even is so much of a pure dexterity game (even though removing the piece carefully is always the right course of action).  I give Bamboleo high points for a pleasing look and an interesting idea that plays well around the table, but as a dexterity game I find the experience a little blunt.

Dexterity game where you try to remove objects from a round plate balanced on a cork ball. Initial setup a bit tricky but fun enough. Game ends pretty quick (a couple of rounds at most).

Another great idea for a dexterity game that doesn't work as well as it would be expected.  It's too hard to get it balanced in the first place and too many games end in the first couple of turns.  Not enough game for the price but still enjoyable to have.

This game can be over before it begins if the setup is bad or you have a seriously unskilled player amongst you. But, with a good set up and a group of steady hands and good eyes, the tension and excitment this game creates can be intense. When it's good, it's very good. My rating assumes the best circumstances.

Good fun, amazing how the whole thing can tip at improbable angles without falling over. The weight of the plate is significantly heavier than individual pieces so that seemingly 'impossible pieces can be removed. Have also played with small chocolate bars or miniature drink bottles.

You remove pieces and hope that the whole thing doesn't come tumbling down, what could be more fun than that? It's a great dexterity-ish game, with a bit of added push-your-luck.

RATING: 8
Once you get the hang of removing the pieces (you have to let them rise slowly, using the bottom of the piece being removed to steady the board) this really becomes a lot of fun.  I've only played 2-player, and it seems like team play and other variants would be even more enjoyable.  I've seen all of the pieces come off the board before, which seems near impossible at certain points of the game.  I suppose that I could rearrange the pieces to make a more difficult game, but it's not very rewarding if the platter collapses just shortly after the beginning of the game.

An original idea, a surprisingly functional technical implementation, and an eye-catching design. Perhaps ultimately not so exciting a game. The variant where you score by weight seems more interesting, but I'm not sure how much the pieces all weigh. If nothing else, this game and Bandu function as expansions to each other.

RATING: 6.5
A nasty little dexterity game that relies more on the players' understanding of fulcrums and levers than a steady hand. We played without any of the scoring variants, but I'd expect those would add a little bit. As it stands, I think you have to go out of your way to set up the board so that there's a fairly even spread of pieces - if you don't have anything toward the center, you're likely to end up with the board falling on the first move every round.

A provacative party game!  As a game for gamers, Bamboleo is lacking.  But as a fun group activity, or a party event, Bamboleo shines.

One of the best dexterity games there is.

RATING: 9
A slow tension-building, take-one-piece-off-at-a-time from a teetering flat platform dex game.  The game ends eventually, so make sure you count the pieces before playing so that when they all fall down on the floor, you can check for all the pieces.  I prefer to play this with the variant/advanced scoring method that considers the weight/sizes of the various shaped pieces (basically mark each piece with a number for it's weight).  Most grams or points wins. (See images #78940 and #78941.  The pieces are easily discernible so just print out a copy of the two photos that show all the black & red shaped pieces and assign points by weight of each piece.  Most points by grams is the winner.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable balancing act where I do recommend using the variant that more points are gained by taking off large pieces off the tray.  I believe some of the photos of the game show the values of the blocks.  It can definitely be tricky to initially figure out how to balance the tray at the start of the game though!  As well, if you want to add more difficulty to the game, have a fan or two blowing over the table making it sway in the breeze!!!

Surprisingly, my 3 year old really enjoys this game.  We usually play without the cork ball and try and get all of the pieces off the board without the board falling.  We must have played this game 30 times since I broke it out 2 weeks ago.  He also loves building little castles with the pieces after he's taken them off the yellow disk.  Now, I just have to play this with adults and see what I think about the game. :^)

An extremely light game wherein players attempt to remove pieces from a wooden board.

Entertaining game, fun to watch. Should probably try with a scale, that might be better. The scores tend to be fairly close, until someone tips the platter.

Indifferent.

Now THIS is a cool stacking game.  When you take off a piece and the whole board starts to leeeeeeaaaaannnn over to one side, and everyone's eyes go wide, and then the thing settles down and nothing falls off, and you have to wonder if the laws of physics suddenly suspended themselves just for the sake of the game, you know you're playing a good stacking game.

This is a fun dexterity game that is easy to pick up.  You have a round 'platter' perched precariously on a cork ball.  The goal is to remove pieces from the platter without knocking it over.  The cork ball allows the platter to list at precarious angles.

I always seem to read the tip in the rules that its better to move the pieces than the board after I've spend ages trying to move the board around.

Haven't played too often yet but it's always been a hit, but I'm not sure we've ever really scored. I seem to spend more time rebuilding. Shame more people havent heard of this. It's a great concept and perfect to break the ice.

An excellent game in the dexterity genre. If played too frequently it could easily wear out its welcome (as is the case for most games of this type) but as a light-hearted filler it will have everyone laughing and having a good time.

There's too many easy crashes and too much setup for this to be much fun, leading to exasperation and over-carefulness more than anything, not wanting to spoil the game for the others by bringing it to an early crashing halt.

RATING: 6
Definitely amazing to watch as you wonder how the plate balances and wobbles dramatically, but still stays on the cork ball. Game play is of interest for gaining physical information as to where the weight is distributed, but is really a spectacle and more of a two player standoff. But once the novelty wears off, the noise of the plate falling and the time spent picking the pieces up and getting the plate to balance becomes a chore. Gulo Gulo may have less emotional impact but has more of a game and less of a resetting job. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is awesome! BUT only if you’re playing it for the 1st or 2nd time, when there still some uncertainty and tension of whether the plate will balance and how on Earth is that possible. After that, matches become very predictable and not surprise at all. This drives away all the fun of the game - the tension.

Don’t buy this one. Play a friend's copy. After 2 or 3 plays, you'll get everything the game has to offer. If you want a similar (but great) game, go for Villa Palletti.

This is a cute Dexterity game where you try to remove objects from a disk balanced on a ball and stick without tipping the thing over. There's a knack to setting the thing up. The game has some fun tension, but my group was unbelievably bad at the game, causing it to fall pretty much every round. I wasn't thrilled with the damage this game caused my wooden table when it fell, or the big loud BANG it makes when it falls. I like this game, but I don't feel it's worth the cost of refinishing my table, and I don't think it's better than other Dexterity games I own.

This is a point-accumulating game played round after round. There are some interesting choices to be made. The fun moments come when everyone passes, but someone dares to pull off the impossible, costing everyone a point (piece).

Good game to bring to a party. Easy to teach.

I like dexterity games, but only when they offer me some sort of decisions.  Positional assessment or long term planning are great when combined with skill-based actions.  Unfortunately, even after you get past the irritating setup phase, Bamboleo does not deliver.  Just take the obvious piece.  Repeat until someone accidentally makes themselves lose.  Then hope your seating order gave you the most valuable pieces.

Great quick party/dexterity game.  Most people are immediatly intrigued by the beautiful components.  After a few plays, it gets a bit stale.  Switch to BANDU after that.

--Dec 2005-- This is really quite peculiar.  On one side, it's a silly dexterity game; on the other, it's a game of subtle judgement requiring a good deal of practice.  It's that second aspect that makes it not quite as good a game for the children as something like _Hamsterrolle_; yet it's one that I suspect they'll eventually become very good at and enjoy.

Very striking and intuitive dexterity game. Can be played with either "most pieces" rules or with "highest combined mass" rules. Engineers seem to enjoy this one a lot, and it gives us a reason to rag each other about force tables and moment determinations.

It's annoying when kids make a careless first move and destroy five minutes of set up before you even get to make a play. Older players can remove  all the pieces with the big ball. I haven't seen that happen yet with the little ball though!

Bamboleo (Circular Platform) -- I find this more tense than Hamsterrolle.  As with Hamsterrolle, this brings out the child in almost any adult.

RATING: 6
Played once with 3P. Unlike other balancing dexterity games where players try to add pieces to a structure, Bamboleo has you remove them. Of course, you'll have to actually set up the structure, and half the game is getting the tray to balance in the first place. A lot of the decisions are quite obvious and are based off simple physics - just remove a piece from the part where the tray is leaning towards. The advanced variant, which counts the total weight of the pieces instead of just the number of pieces, would make the game a lot more challenging. Still, this game is a sight to behold once in motion, and I just love the sheer terror that occurs the moment the tray begins to tilt.

Missing one round wooden piece. Anyone have a spare?

Solid dexterity game. Poor and desperate play can end the game quickly though. It has very nice solid wooden parts. The disc is huge!

Look out on BGG for a picture of Doug Adams points variant (he weighed each piece and assigned points value to them).

Great with a crowd.

Looks like an 8 out of the box but we can't seem to get beyond 4-6 pieces before it collapses on us. Need more plays for better analysis/rating but it's hard to persevere when resetting the play field every 2-3 minutes.

This is a steady-hand dexterity game, making difficult to rank this one.  The platform is essentially balanced upon a cork sphere placed upon top of a wooden pedestal.  This can cause the platform to wobble back and forth rather dramatically.  Players attempt to remove wooden objects from the platform without causing the contraption to fall over.  The downside is the noise and resetting when everything topples over.

RATING: 9
This is a great dexterity game where you must remove pieces rather than adding them (although, it does have a variant to add pieces).  While great fun, especially when that board really starts to tip, I feel that as a game, only the last few pieces give a player any real decision (as no one is really going to weigh the pieces for scoring).  Most of the time pulling pieces is a bit obvious, and the only choice you have is to make the board tip farther, thereby making it easier for people to take bottom pieces or balancing the board out making it easier to take center pieces.  Still though, I'd be inclined (no pun intended) to play again at a moment's notice.

UPDATE: The game is vastly improved with the weighed scoring.  You can look at the pictures here on the geek if you need help.  This turns the game from a lively distraction to a great system with some real (although minor) strategy.  It makes going for the big pieces early, getting small pieces to pass away and tallying rounds well worthwhile now.  This game is downright addictive.

An evergreen favourite dexterity game; the appearance of it will always draw a crowd of people wanting to try it.  Although there are rules for it, generally we end up playing it with a Jenga-like approach of trying not to bring the whole thing crashing down and, down it finally falls, mocking the person that finished it off.

An interesting dexterity game, and harder than it first appears. You really have to be very careful in removing the pieces, and the balance is both remarkably easily altered while at the same time I'm amazed at the angle the board can be at without tipping over.

RATING: 5
A well-designed game that unfortunately suffers from the Jenga problem where there is one loser but multiple winners (unless you're playing with two).  Where's the competitive fun in that?  I suppose you could create brackets and have a tournament.

Not sure if I'd prefer Sac Noir or this more. This one will definitely draw a bigger crowd. The amazing physics defying game play is what will attract attention, though that doesn't make it a great game now does it? Its a dexterity game and one that doesn't require much imagination or strategy. Its also a pain in the ass to setup each round.

With absolutely no room for error, Bamboleo is the nuclear reactor of dexterity games.  The plate is balanced on a cork ball and each wooden piece is quite heavy, so any move shifts the playing field dramatically.  The advantage here is in terms of replayability, but newbies may be dissuaded by the sheer largeness of the experience--and the unpredictability of catastrophic failure.

Excellent wooden components and the thrill of defying gravity make for quite an initial draw, but I think that this type of balancing dexterity game (Villa Palletti, Hamsterrolle, Bandu) loses its lustre after a few plays.

Fun to have around for large groups, kids and non-gamers, but not something that is going to get pulled out by my regular game group at all.  

Sold.

I will be happy to admit that I am not particularly coordinated and am thus a pretty inept opponent when it comes to dexterity games. I've managed to get better at Crokinole after significant practice, but others like Villa Paletti and Polarity have always eluded and challenged me. Bamboleo was no exception as I managed to come in dead last and managed to knock over the contraption more times than I can count. It was an interesting game as it involved a bunch of strangely shaped wooden blocks on a round platform, which was balanced on a cork ball on top of a pillar. However, the whole thing was very wobbly and seemed wont to go toppling anytime I got near it (and we were even playing with the easier and supposedly more stable larger cork ball). I couldn't even setup the thing usually, let alone start removing the wooden blocks. It doesn't help that I couldn't figure out which side to take from or how far from the center I could afford to take from. In the end though, I did enjoy the game simply because it was light-hearted and fun, if a bit frustrating. It's not something that I'm eager to get for myself, but it's another in a line of silly dexterity games that are certainly great to break out after a heavy four-hour game.

Only briefly tried it. Cannot give it a thoughtful comment yet.
Generally, it's a nice balancing game. The plate and cork-ball make up a brilliant balancing device. The piece-picking rule with scoring is cleverer than usual games using placement rule. 
Anticipating for trying the weight-based variant as well as the partnership variant. I expect to raise its rating after a few more decent plays.
The current drawback is the setup which takes a bit much time to balance it for the first few games. I am getting more skillful for doing so now anyway.

One of two dexterity games that I own, I like Bamboleo better than Villa Paletti. Not bad, but requires a bigger crowd for more hoots and laughs. 

At first blush, this game seems impossible, but it is actually not as tough. Balancing the pieces on the flat and more stable edge makes this game a little easier to handle. If you have cone or spherical shaped pieces lying on its side and allow it to roll freely, this game is tremendously tougher.

Overall a decent to good party game.

This is a clever and interesting take on a dexterity game. There is some skill to picking up the pieces--take it slow--but not much. It's really all in which piece you decide to pick. Decisions are usually pretty straightforward. It's pretty damn addictive though.

OK family game that comes out every 3-4 months.  Each game takes 5-10 minutes, until someone forgets about the fulcrum effect and then we have to play the second part of Bamboleo - hunt for the pieces on the floor.

Not a strong recommend - if it dissappeard from my collection would not be the end of the world - but a good physical filler.

This is a very good game of strategy and physics, with just a little dexterity thrown in.  Even though it looks like a dexterity game, most of the success in the game is identifying blocks that are safe to remove, and bailing or passing when it just can't be done.  Solid rules, and nothing but choices make this a much more satisfying teetering tower game than most.

Juego curioso de cartas, de organizar un "tablero" de 5x5 losetas con símbolos (estrellas, meteoritos, eclipses, etc.) para invocar a los 4 dioses de la mitología Lovecraftiana y sus seguidores que dan bonus a la invocación de sus maestros. Tiene como curiso la posibilidad de hacer combos y modificar o incrementar los símbolos/acciones para mover las losetas para organizar el cielo, que dan también los bichejos invocados. Cada uno de ellos tiene una puntuación, el primero que consiga 10 puntos con criaturas invocadas gana la partida.

A really clever little tile game here, probably one of my favorite from the Steve Jackson catalog. You set up a field of stars, and then need to arrange them in certain patterns to summon Lovecraftian monsters, only you can also discard other creatures to affect how you'll shift and flip the tiles around to make those patterns. There are also various creature powers which can add just a little more depth and strategy. Artwork is adorable and it's fairly intuitive to teach people. Surprised this one doesn't get talked about more often, even if it's a few years old.

as the rules are written the game has a horrible downtime. yet it is interesting enough to just SCREAM for variant to make it playable. perhaps play it like group scrabble with everyone thinking about the same position, perhaps show some monsters 'done' and an elder one, and have people race who finds a way to play the elder one, or a ricochet robots variant where you show many aliens and one elder one, and people try to find fewest aliens needed to put the elder one in play.

in any case, if you want to play the game without variants the downtime'll kill you, and if if doesn't the randomness will.

The is a bit of a marmite game, you either love it or hate it. It has an orientation element requiring you to not just mentally rotate the board but flip certain squares in you mind. Keeping all this in your head when the board changes every single turn can make planning ahead a bit pointless. None the less we get great fun out of this. It's an entertaining mental challenge, the lack of a need to plan ahead means you can chat while you play and not worry about missing something. All in all, my idea of a great light game.

Interesting game, but I got lost in analysis paralysis on the first turn. There are just too many options to try to figure out each turn and it is compounded by the fact that there is very little planning that can be done from turn to turn.

Bought the game for 10,89€ at amazon.de

[2008-12-11 Rating: n.a. -> 7]
First play of "Die Sterne stehen richtig" and initial rating.

----------------------
Short rule overview
----------------------
"Die Sterne stehen richtig" is a game that is quiet different from all other games I own. The game itself contains 25 double-sided tiles with two different symbols on each side and 75 cards. During the initial setup, you have to arrange the symbol-tiles randomly into a 5x5-grid. Each player takes 5 of the 75 cards into their hands, the remaining cards are placed at one side of the grid and are used as the draw-pile. 

During their turn, each player can perform five actions, whereas four of them are optional. First you can play one card from your hand. This allows you to manipulate the symbol-tiles in the 5x5-grid. Depending on the card you played, you can either switch the positions of any two adjacent cards, nudge an entire row of the 5x5-grid or flip a symbol-tile to reveal the symbol on the other side of the card. The played card is discarded afterwards.

You do all this, to “summon” (read: add) cards to your own "cult-area", which is just a fancy name for own storage area on the table. Each card comes with a special symbol-combination printed on it. In order to summon a card, this symbol-combination must be visible in the 5x5-grid. If this is the case, you can add the card to your cult-area, which can contain up to six cards. If you want to add a seventh one, you have to discard one card you added before. Adding a card to your cult-area is considered as an action.

Cards in your cult-area serve two purposes: First, they are victory points. Each card comes with a value ranging from 0 to 4 printed on it. You win the game, when the sum of the victory-points printed on the cards in your cult-area is equal or greater 10.
Second, each card in your cult-area gives you a special ability. Some allow you to draw more cards, some allow you to ignore symbols during the summoning of a card and so on. Using the special abilities of the cards in your cult-area is considered as an action.

The last two actions available to you are discarding a card (in case you can't really use it in the current situation) and drawing new cards until you have five cards in your hand again.

So all the possible actions of a player during their turn are:
1. Play a card and manipulate the 5x5-grid. (optional)
2. Use cards in the cult-area. This can be combined with action 1. (optional)
3. Add a card to the cult-area if the correct symbol-constellations is visible in the 5x5-grid. (optional)
4. Discard one card from your hand. (optional)
5. Draw cards from the draw-pile until you have five cards in your hand again. (not optional)

Comments
--------------
* This game is a game of pattern recognition. While I'm magically able to recognize them quite quickly, other players might not be. In this case, the game can really drag on and become boring. I had to suffer through this myself during my first game. However, I guess with someone who can see patterns as fast as I can, the game can be a lot of fun. But before buying this game, you should make sure, that you and your gaming buddies have this ability.

* The components are okay, but not top-notch. Especially the symbol-tiles could have been a lot thicker and less glossy.

* The 5x5-grid resembles the sky with stars, meteors and moons. While this helps with the theme, I don't think it was a wise choice. The problem is that all the symbols look quite similiar to each other and it is harder to differentiate them from another than it should be. In my opinion it would have been better to use different colors for different symbols. This might have helped players who can't easily recognize patterns too.

* The manual could have been much clearer. For a rather simple game, I had to consult it quite often. In my opinion it would have been better, to start the manual with an overview of the play and not a discussion of the single actions. Some additional examples wouldn’t have hurt too.

* But all in all I have to say: The gameplay itself is fun and quite unique. There is the possibility of cool combos by using the cards in your cult-area and the learning curve isn't too steep. I'm looking forward to play "Die Sterne stehen richtig" again.

I love this game. I've played it three times with 3 players and twice with 2 players. It didn't seem too chaotic either way. It's hard to really thwart the guy in the lead since you don't know what he's holding. There ought to be a card that lets you look at another player's hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It plays like chess because there are so many possible moves to consider. Best played with two players, more than that is frustrating due to time spent and that the sky looks like a bomb went off in it every time you start your turn again. (No chance to set up for future turns without other players messing it up).

The misspelled minions, servitors, and old ones take away from the game for me. I don't know why. They just do. What was up with that anyway, SJG just didn't want to pay copyrights? Still a fun and innovative game. There's not much quite like it out there.

RATING: 5
Puzzle games are fine and good, but this game allows for almost zero strategic play or look ahead.  When it's my turn, I look to see what the best play I can make is and then do it.  If you get lucky and draw cards that are doable, then you might win.  Meh.

I love this game, but I recognize not everyone else does.  The artwork is fun, and manipulating everything in the sky to summon the dark elder gods is awesome.  I almost feel that summoning Cthulu or Hastur should end the game, but they need to balance the scores.  If you have nothing but minions and lesser servitors it can be a real challenge to get anything on the board.  And once you have several guys on the table it is easy to change the whole sky to suit your needs.  Analysis paralysis gets frustrating when it's not your turn.

RATING: 7.5
This game is really fun but challenging! If you get annoyed when someone takes a long time on their turn, you may want to avoid this one.  Although slow play usually frustrates my partner, she really likes this one a lot.  This seems superior to most other "puzzle-like" games we've tried, such as The Hanging Gardens.  I really love the artwork as well, and the satisfying feeling you get when you finally figure out the tricky manipulations needed to summon a great old one.  As long as you go into it knowing that the variabilty of the playing field means there is not a lot of possible advanced planning, just tactical puzzle solving, this is the best and most challenging game of that genre that I've tried.  I just hope that I'll get better at it after further plays, it's really challenging!

Update: I've definitely improved at this game over time, and with players of equal skill, often the finish is very close and the winner can seem like it is determined by luck. The gameplay is still challenging and enjoyable though as long as you don't put too much value on who wins. My partner and I have changed the end game condition to allow each player the same number of turns to increase fairness and make scores more competitive.

This is a great new addition for SJ Games that deviates from their normal games (a nice new trend for them). This game is GREAT for those thinkers that can visualize patterns in things (in this case the stars). It is a good mind challenging game with a nice theme. Bear in mind, this game will not be fun for those people that do not enjoy puzzle type games. I ran this game at RandomCon 2010 a couple times and some of the players just could NOT get their mind around the tiles and how to move them to make patterns.

RATING: 4
Most games with a Cthulhu theme have me interested.  The artwork is great and I would describe it as a Euro/Puzzle hybrid card game.  Why?  You really have to puzzle the layout of the stars and how to change it to play your cards.  This becomes less important as the game goes on as you will have an engine built up to allow you to influence the stars more significantly.  It feels a bit like a Euro because you're getting victory points but there are a few cards that allow direct interaction with your opponents.  The most disappointing aspect of the game is the randomness of the cards combined with the chaos of the stars can give people lucky breaks and a possible runaway leader syndrome.

Played once.  This can be a real brain-burner, and is good for people that like puzzles.  It can also lead to analysis paralysis, although you can do some planning when it's not your turn.  Just be aware that things can change before it comes around to you again, sometimes for the worst, and sometimes for the better, so PAY ATTENTION to the game and no one will get hurt.

A puzzle game in which the puzzle is changed by the player immediately before you just before your turn starts---so you have limited ability to plan during other people's turns.  This can result in down time.

In addition, the actions of the other players can either hand you a great opportunity or undo everything you did on your previous turn---and they don't even know whether this is happening.

I'm not a big fan of this type of game in general, and if I did choose to play such a game, this isn't the one I'd pick.

This game lasts too long for my liking. I love Cthulhu and Steve Jackson, but I fell that a lot of his stuff lasts too long for the fun it delivers. This game is a little infuriating due to the fact that you are trying to arrange to board in certain ways, but everyone else keeps moving it.

This was very hit or miss for me.  Either it worked great or was exceptionally frustrating because you just couldn't see any path to victory at all.
Ultimately we got rid of this because its REALLY hard to play if you wear bifocals (or trifocals)
You have two different focal points between the cards and the tiles and switching back and forth can produce a lot of eyestrain from switching back and forth.  Reading glasses didn't really help in this case.

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WITH BIFOCALS.

I think this is an entertaining game but it has a couple of flaws. First off, it's a little long for what it is.

This is like an advanced version of [thing=437][/thing], but with a little more control over board manipulations. Enjoyable Hand Management game coupled with an ever-changing puzzle to solve...

The above text is written about a two player game, which is fun. I rate two player as "7".

With three players, too much chaos creeps in and the game becomes more frustrating and much longer. I rate three player as "4".

A four player game is an unholy mess that is neither fun nor short. I've never finished a four player game, having quit in disgust early on, but I would give it a provisional rating of "2".

Each turn you have an interesting spatial problem before you.  In a 4 player game, you can't exactly plan for your next move, but there are things you can do to make the stars more favorable for your next turn.  There is some hand management as well.  Cards have two uses and it is good to select a card for discard as well.  You have to balance between the odds of getting a card out vs. how much it will really help you vs. how much would another card likely help.  There really is a good amount to think about.  I would recommend this game but it could easily overwhelm some.

The Stars Are Right is a rare example of a game featuring a sliding, modular puzzle at its core. It feels like the kind of game Mensa would give an award to with the central challenge consisting of manipulating the board through card play to create patterns.

It's a solid game with a theme that works, but it suffers from one major problem: analysis paralysis. Some turns can drag because players (not only the ones prone to taking longer turns) need time to check and see which patterns they can create.

Still, it's a unique game and one worth trying out for fans of spatial puzzles.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (February 2012)

It’s been a long time since my only play of The Stars Are Right so I don’t remember much. 

I do remember that I think the game is best with two players, with more the downtime can be staggering as each player changes the board configuration so you can´t really think ahead of your turn. I also don’t like the end condition. I think the game ends as soon as a player gets 10 VPs (but I could be mistaken) because some players will have one more round than others, so it is unfair.  The game is a bit more complex that I initially though.

Good art and components. 

I’m rating it according to my desire to play the game again.

Bottom line, I think I like the game, but I need to play it again to properly rate and comment the game.

Current Rating: 6.0

Wow. I'm torn.

The basic game play is nice. It reminded me strongly of Chrononauts, with out the missions...just a goal of 10 points. the problem in game play is massive down time with 4 players. It's a really slow puzzle game.

With 2 players, probably not a problem, but with more...a problem. The issue in my mind, and one of the key differences from Chrononauts, is that each card in your hand has a different star map key on it to bring it into play. So each player must look at the cards availible to them, to their already summoned cards (whose exchange rate power you can use to affect any card you play to move the stars...say turn one column/row push into two card flips instead), and re-evaluate each card as the other players move the star map around...in other words, you must re-evaluate every card in your hand (to see if you can play it) every single time someone does something to the star map.

This lead to 20-30 minute turns per player (not kdding)...even despite thinking actively during your turn. SUCKED!!! 

That sucked hard and I was more than ready for the game to end, but I'll be honest I still liked the puzzle nature and basic structure of the game. The game play  experience though...well, it was like sitting 1 point away from Munchkin victory for over an hour and not being able to do a dang thing to move it on...not fun.

For whatever reason Steve Jackson games lists it as playing in an hour. This is pure bullshit. There is just no way. With 2 players, OK...but with more, no chance.

Please keep in mind, I'm ripping the game length and down time (which sucked hard), but the game play I enjoyed. Really.

It's a good puzzle. It MAY speed up as there may be exchange rates you learn with familiarity, but will you get to that level of play? 

No. People will be done, or put a figurative bullet through their dome, before you get there. 

Keep it lower # of players and I think you're good.

I should note, this can be played solo...my variants: deal out 1 or more Old Ones and track how many turns it takes to conjure them, or track how many turns it takes to get to 10 VPs.

So, I'm torn, my experience last night bit. The game was tortuous and long...but the game play had promise as a puzzle game.

It may rock as a two player game.

As a puzzle game, Stars works great. As a multiplayer board game, however, the game falls apart as it encourages massive AP during players' turns. Because the board changes from turn to turn, it is virtually impossible to pre-plan moves. And because there are so many moves available, players could take lots of time to find optimal moves during their turns.

As a play-by-email (or similar) game, Stars would be terrific.

I fell in love with this game the moment I heard about it; You are playing cultists, rearranging the sky, to align stars to summon horrors from beyond the realm of human understanding. What's not to love!? 

It's a little clunky to teach to new players, but once you get the hang of it, it plays pretty fast. The sky mechanic is where it gets most of it's points from me. 

The sky is also such a creative mechanic that it's hard not to be intrigued by it.

Juego muy divertido. Hay que encontrar la conbinación correcta para convocar a las criaturas y conseguir ptos de victoria antes que tus contrincantes. Sólo he jugado con 2 jugadores, con 3 o 4 debe ser mucho más caótico y dado al Análisis-Parálisis. Rápido y recomendable. Después de probarlo con 4 jugadores puedo decir que me parece igual de bueno, aunque supongo que depende de los jugadores.

RATING: 5
I wonder how much this game really turns on who gets the first Great One played - that person would seem to be at a great advantage and I was able to coast to an easy victory as a result.  This is an interesting puzzle type game although I would never play with more than 2-3.  Four players would just be utter chaos and make thinking ahead totally meaningless and bring a good bit of down time.  It is interesting to try and adjust the constellations to bring in a certain card that you can use in future turns to manipulate the card played into a different and/or more actions.  If you do not see patterns in a 5x5 grid well, I would steer clear of this game.  I do wish the theme was different - I could probably get this played more often.  I think this is likely one of the best, if not the best, Steve Jackson games for me (although my copy is German and not Steve Jackson...;-)

This almost abstract game is very thinky as seeing how you can move the tiles to summon your cards is very difficult, while at the same time having to have the right cards to move the tiles in the right way. However, despite the strategy the game seems to suffer a lot from AP since even if you plan everything out beforehand the tiles can move around a lot, and I think a little bit from runaway leader, as the more monsters you summon the stronger your powers become, while also scoring you points.

It's a game of hand management coupled with pattern recognition and board manipulation; much like Wasabi in most respects.

It's got some chaos, but when the game ended, there was little to feel cheated about and no one thought the game overstayed it's welcome. Initial plays are wrought with downtime, as the puzzle aspect of this game will certainly generate a wealth of AP.

That's my brain after the first couple minutes of play.  This game is a REAL brain burner.  In a good sense.  Players of abstract games will love this one.  I REALLY liked the variety in the monster, in the actions possible and above all, the way you have to visualize the board.  Don't play this with a road sick companion...ahahahaha.

A small downside is the chaos involve in the game make blocking your opponent somewhat impossible, unless you have a little bit of Chtullu in you...

RATING: 6
I really like this game, neat mechanics paired with great looking components; it should be a winner. Unfortunately it barely works with two average players, and I can't imagine how could this be fun with more. You don't have a chance to plan ahead, since your opponent will probably reorder the 5x5 grid completely, therefore you have to do all the analyzing and thinking on your turn, but you have so many possible options at your hand... After a some plays it can speed up, but the first few games will surely drag, and there possibly won't be any incentive to play that few more.

When someone told me that this Steve Jackson game would appeal to me, a lover of abstract games, my ears pricked up.  Steve Jackson games are typically about as far from my beloved 2player, perfect information abstracts as you could imagine. 

So I played the game, and now I think it's crap.  You spend all your time on the rather menial task of just trying to see the pattern you're looking for in the array of tiles.  This kind of thing works great in simultaneous play games like Set and Ricochet Robots, where the fun is in the race to find the pattern first.  But this game doesn't have simultaneous play, so you spend the whole time trying to see patterns and thereby understand just what you can strategize about, and by the time you actually get around to strategizing, you feel bad that your opponent looks so bored, so you move hurriedly and that's your turn.

It's an abstract pattern recognition game by someone who evidently doesn't know much about abstract pattern recognition games.  I guess this is not surprising, given the publisher.

RATING: 7
After one play at 2p, I have to say that this was a very enjoyable game. I can definitely see where the complaints about AP are coming from, and I'm not sure this game would be any good at 3p or 4p. But at 2p, with an opponent who's not in a hurry and doesn't mind long-ish turns, it's a very interesting, gratifying game. We finished our 2p game in about 30 minutes, despite each taking a couple turns that were around 5 minutes.

I do have some concerns about the first player possibly having an advantage, since as far as I can tell from the rules, the game ends immediately when someone reaches 10 points, regardless of who was the first player. Then again, I was first player and my opponent managed to win right before I was about to,  so it's definitely not an insurmountable advantage.

Still, I like the game quite a bit. By far the best Steve Jackson game I've ever played. I found this at a thrift store and had it listed in a math trade, but after playing it, I'm definitely going to keep it.

Initially rating this a 7, but only because I'm not sure just yet how well it will hold up after repeated plays. But if my 10th game of this is anywhere near as fun as my first play was, I may have to raise that to an 8.

The Stars Are Right is a Cthulhu-mythos themed game where players are acolytes of the Ancient Ones attempting to summon forth said creatures for victory. This is achieved by manipulating the night Sky, a board composed of double-sided tiles with various astral symbols on each side to match the patterns indicated on the Creature cards held in the players' hands; an experience not unlike those sliding-tile puzzles.

Although the sky is never something that can be manipulated in reality, or in Lovecraft's novels, the game does feel remarkably thematic despite its simple components and concept. Artistically, the tiles are great, but the cards suck. They're cartoony and goofy-looking. I wish Steve Jackson games had ditched their regular art-style and given TSAR the art and weight that Fantasy Flight gives their Cthulhu games because the conceit of being a bunch of idiots trying to summon ancient evils is far more in keeping with Lovecraft's mythos than any game where players are trying to stop the horrors and have any hope of doing so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice, lightish, abstract brainburner card game. Cards with multiple uses usually create interesting decisions, and this game is not an exception. The pattern recognition part is very tricky.

With quick players, this is surprisingly good with three players as well, but I would not try this with four.

RATING: 5
Similar to Flux and Chrononaughts and other games where there is a shared set of cards (or rules) that can be modified by all players, so people are constantly messing up your own plans without even trying to. Not my thing. At least this one uses points instead of an instant-win scenario like Flux, so it's certainly better. The cartoons are cute, too.

Tricky card game! Don't let the fun illustrations fool you. Working out the constalations is far more difficult then it seems at first, especially at the beginning of the game, when you have little influence over the stars! As you summon new demons though, things start to get gradually more reachable, although other players will be messing things up greatly. It's a fun brain sizzling game, with great conept art. Good one!

- The rules are somewhat clumsy, not very easy to understand, probably easier for players familiar with CCG (especially Magic players). Game for seasoned players.

A fun little points race where one manipulates the heavens to create celestial patterns or constellations to bring creatures from the other dimensions of Lovecraftian literature to our plane of existence.

I play games very quickly. I care about the other person and don't want them waiting on me. I finally found my AP game. This game is ridiculously challenging in identifying how to put together real patterns. I find this game to really mesh with the Cthulhu theme, even though I hate this theme. And I think the game is absolutely brilliant. I just don't really want to play it. Trying to shift the board to get what I want is just to much for me. Pass, but I think it is a solid game. Those with a real spatial recognition will love this one.

RATING: 6
Okay, so this is a 100% abstract game with cute theme (cute while still being Cthulhu). Does the theme help it? Well, it certainly makes sense, but in reality it's a game about making patterns on a constantly changing, shared board. Which means, as you've probably guessed, that it's one hell of a mess with four players. Is it bad, though? No, I wouldn't say so! It's also rather short, so you don't mind the fact it's hard to plan ANYTHING. And thanks to all the amazing player powers someone will win it rather sooner than later.

With two players, you can plan a lot more and then it's a brainburning and challenging duel. I enjoy it with both player counts, although 2p and 4p are totally different beasts, really (with 3p somewhere in between, obviously). Still, making the stars align is a mysteriously satisfying affair and I'll gladly play it when someone asks.

An OK game. Do not expect fast and exciting play as time is consumed between turns plotting your possible moves and calculating your powers. It is a good interactive puzzle though.

One thing that disappointed me was the poor weight of the cards. Feels like they were stamped out of cover stock, not proper card stock. Flimsy, in my opinion. I will have sleeve them if I plan on getting much play out of them in the future.

25 tiles are placed in the centre of the table in a 5x5 grid. Play cards from your hand to flip, push, or swap the tiles thus re-arranging the position of the stars. If you can find (or make) the right combination of stars in the grid you can summon the ancient gods and their servitors.
The game is simple to learn, and plays fairly well. There are a few problems, mostly (like all Steve Jackson games) resulting from a lack of play testing. The game will become unbearably slow without a timer (none is included), it is too visio-spatial for most players, and there is a fairly quick plataeu in the skill level.
A fun, interesting, filler game for the right group of *quick* players.

TSAR and Revolution were designed by Eurogame designers. Really, saying you're not going to pick up TSAR because it's a SJG is like saying you're not going to buy Stone Age because you didn't like Gulo Gulo.

As for optimal number of players, two is best. Since the board doesn't change as much by the time it gets to your turn, you can plan during your opponent's moves better. I played a game when I was planning during Player 2's turn, ready to play, then Player 3 moved the board around. Gee, thanks!

The concept behind The Stars are Right is that each player is a cultist trying to arrange the sky so create certain patterns or orientations of tiles of the sky in order to summon the Great Old Ones. The sky is a 25 x 25 grid of double sided tiles with different images, and by playing cards players gain different movements to affect the sky. I've always really enjoyed this game - it's pretty quick and the concept is easy to learn. It's great with 2 or 3 players - with 3 it can be a little tedious waiting for turns to go around.

I don't know why, but this game appeals to me. Two players (and only two players) means there's little randomness that can't be counteracted, and enough fun to make for a nice little filler when cthulionic mayhem is asked for.

Hits the table alot between me and my SO.

Despite the silly theme and cutesy Chuthulian art, this game requires a lot of thought. In fact, almost too much thought. My wife absolutely hated it...lol. I liked it well enough, but it's not one we'll play often.

Puzzlerrhea. I wonder how much game is here.  When it is your turn you have to find the best option for scoring.  It may take a few seconds or it might take 5 to 10 minutes.  Tiles are double sided and actions can be filtered to compound or mutate to new actions.  So there may be that game winning move there somewhere with just the perfect combination of cards.  How can you ask someone to go quicker when that is all there is to the game?  Mostly this game just asks for players to self regulate by not being an asshole, but then why play this game.  With two players it is absurd, but still kind of funny in how long it takes.  With 4 this would be a nightmare.

Played this game one time with 4 players. I enjoyed it and I won but my gf was not a big fan of the 4 player version because people kept affecting her plans. I think she would like it better 2 players (as would I).

RATING: 7.5
Very fun little tile shifting puzzle game, with a Cthulhu theme.  Really an abstract game where you move tiles by playing cards, but the H P Lovecraft overtones seem to fit nicely.  Quite intense, as you need to both think spatially and plan ahead, but then other players' moves will often torpedo your plans ...  Could lend itself to analysis paralysis with the wrong player(s).  

It's a game for 2-4 players, but we like it with 2 best, as there will be some messing up of your intended moves by the other player, but not all the time.  [Others like the extra interaction with 3 players, but most people seem to think 4 players makes it a bit too long and chaotic.]  Highly recommended.

本來也很期待的......因為是克蘇魯主題，又有圖像排列的元素，本來以為輕鬆有趣的，但是玩起來卻冗長又繁複。遊戲中玩家要透過卡牌來讓5X5的星空改變，才能召喚出手上的邪神們，以獲得分數。遺憾的是玩家很難在對手思考時同步規劃策略(因為星空等等就亂了)，導致等待時間過長。20160522

This is a fantastic puzzle-game best played with 2.  Three is pretty good, 4 I just don't like at all.  With 4 there is too much that happens between your turn and your next turn as three other players mess around with the star formations.  It's not the downtime that hurts with 4, though it's substantial, it's the utter lack of control.

With 2 there is a great balance between setting up possible moves for next turn, and trying to simply get things summoned which can help alter the incantations. 

So far the game seems quite balanced in that games will often end with both players able to summon the winning god on the same turn or the next.

In particular this plays well for gamers who not only have great spatial awareness,and don't mind building their "downstream" thinking muscle.

Strange, strange game in which you summon elder/lesser gods (Cthulhu, et al) by modifying a tableau of cards with various symbols/star configurations on them to match the arrangement on the card of the creature you're trying to summon.  May play this again, as we were actually playing this at the same time as an 18xx game with the same players, so we weren't really putting much effort into it.

RATING: 7
The pros:
The game has a nice variety of "gaming" on it: is a space coordination game (as Ubongo, when you need to see where something needs to be and what should be done to put it there), a card game (like Glory to Rome, when you pay the construct a building and can use it's "powers") and a humorous game (such as Munchkin - similarity not coincidental). And it all works well. A smart game with a interesting mechanics regarding righting that dammed stars! Oh, and some pretty good funny art.

The cons:
It's not a dominant game - it won't attract players to go to your house just to play it. And it's not a filler also - as the game lasts for about one hour. So, I say it is a game for those who like the theme and can play a game just for the fun. I can. Can you?

They took a neat concept, making patterns on a mutable shared grid with some minor special powers, and made it as boring and frustrating as possible. The high downtime and inability to plan at all turn a cool idea into something I wouldn't want to play again, except maybe as a solo puzzle.

I want to rate this but it is filler.  Succeeds as filler.  Succeeds as a brain burner.  I may keep this one.  Gets old quickly.  No arc.  Always the same kind of tension.  Calculating game.  Board vision game.  Pattern game.  Good for a quick mental workout.

Has most of the usual problems of such games - there can be a lot of downtime, there is little use in planning before it is your turn (which contributes to the downtime), and most of the player interaction is effectively random (my play may interfere with your plans, but I can't know that).

It took 4 years after its release to purchase this game and get it to the table. Now, after a couple of plays with two players, I regret not getting it sooner. Despite its relative age, the game still feels fresh and unique. If your are in the mood for a two player puzzler, check it out. I fear that the game might bog down with more than two.

Re-arrange the constellations into certain patterns in order to summon Great Old Ones for points. Fantastic artwork. 

I really like the action chaining and puzzle like nature of your turns. You play a card to get a certain number of manipulations of the stars, and can then invoke the assistance of other creatures you've previously summoned to get more or change the nature of the manipulations you can do. For example, you might start your turn by playing a card that lets you flip two of the constellation tiles over. One of your creatures has the power to turn 1 tile flip into 2 flips, so now you have 3 tile flips. Another creature you have turns a tile flip into a swap two adjacent tiles action, so now you have 2 flips and 1 swap. So you flip two tiles over, swap one tile with another, giving you the exact shape needed to claim your third creature...

The Stars Are Right (German: Die Sterne Stehen Richtig) is a Cthulhu Mythos-themed card game illustrated by François "Goomi" Launet, best known for his comic series "The Unspeakable Vault of Doom."
In the game you'll start small, bringing ghasts and ghouls back to our reality. Invoke minor creatures to flip over a tile or push a row, creating the correct patterns to summon more and more powerful ones. Eventually, you'll build a horde of Servitors who can chain flips, pushes, and switches together; rearranging the entire grid to your whims. Change the skies, summon a Great Old One, and win! The game is won by acquiring 10 points first, which can be done by summoning many small creatures or going for Great Old Ones. Creatures which give more points tend to require more complex constellations. The night sky is represented by a 5x5 field of objects. It can be manipulated by moving a row by one object (cycling through), flipping one object (both sides have different objects), and switching two neighboring objects.

Players randomly interfere with each other's plans - a mechanic perfected in Z-Man's [i]Wasabi[/i] - until someone mercifully ends the game.

If there were a supernova rule to shorten the game by 15 minutes, my rating might go up a half point.  In fact, I may just have to wake the designer from his pile of riches to make that suggestion.

A nice surprise from Steven Jackson Games, one that actually require a bit of thinking instead of dumb luck.  I like the puzzle concept and the ability to manipulate the board, but I think it requires to much memorization and bookkeeping, especially when trying to redo moves that the previous player had done and when you have too many powers on hand.  A good effort that may have limited appeal, just not streamlined enough to make me want to play again.

I bought The Stars Are Right because I've been into Lovecraft since then.
I've played it against a single opponent and we had considerable downtimes. The fact that your opponent's turn changes to board considerably makes it almost impossible to plan beforehand.
Theme is well executed though.

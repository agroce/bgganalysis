RATING: 8
Probably my favourite Knizia game. Combines a couple of types of auction with some other interesting mechanisms for a finely balanced game which will reward repeated plays. Better as a five player game (probably rates a 7 for 3/4 players).

An economic, optimize your own move game that has two interesting bidding phases to it.

This a very thematic game (for Knizia) where you are acquiring (bidding) and developing your own provinces (through the use of money, which can be very tight), and then making a sacrifice to the gods (blind-bidding), and getting the harvest from your provinces (income). 

The game is essentially played in two parts: the old kingdom, and the new kingdom, with all of the development from the old kingdom (excluding farmers) being carried over to the new kingdom, BUT you lose ownership of your old provinces, and may or may not be able to re-aquire them in the new kingdom.  A scoring phase happens afer the completion of each kingdom.  

There are many ways to score points, as per most Knizia games: certain power card requirements met, completed pyramids, sets of pyramids (encourages you to develop each of your provinces), majorities of pyramids (encourages you to not develop each of your provinces), temples (if you're fortunate enough to have acquired them), and most money (only for the new kingdom).

There is alot of strategy to this game, as you have to plan out which provinces you want to obtain, how much you're willing/able to spend to get them (there are some very neat nuances with the bidding system here too, such as not being able to re-bid on a province you've been overbid on, and the perfectly determined increases in cost for each bid), how to manage your development of your provinces (again, the costs are perfect, in that it gets VERY expensive to buy too much at once)- should you go for farmers=money, stones/pyramids=points, should you try your luck at the power cards...lots of tough economic decisions.  Plus the sacrifice can make or break you financially, and is definitely a tense but fun event.

This game works for 3-5, although I prefer 4-5, as it can get very competitive.  This is one of my wife's favourites for reasons unknown to me, and I thoroughly enjoy it as well.

Reiner Knizia is often lambasted for his "pasted on" themes, but this title is VERY thematic and is a most wonderful game. I appreciate the passage of time in this game and find the auctions very tense with a press-your-luck element to them, as well as the persistence of monuments for the second half of the game. The good doctor did a wonderful job with this one.

RATING: 7
One of the last great Knizia games. Each turn consists of a round of uniquely styled bidding--often called an "Amun-Re auction" because it originated here but you can see it in games like Homesteaders and Cyclades--followed by the players making an offering to Amun-Re. 

The first auction gets most of the press, but the offering itself is a kind of communal bid. Amun-Re sends more rain the more he is offered. But rain benefits some more than others, with some even being hurt by it. And, of course, no one wants to spend more money then they have to. It's a decision that is simultaneously thematic, interactive, complex, non-fiddly, and quick. This is why Knizia's a genius, folks.

I'm beginning to think as a rule I don't like Kniezier games (Ra being the exception to this rule). This one in particular feels like a jumble of mechanics tossed together. There are some calculations along the way, but once resolved, no decision felt terribly challenging. It is very much a rinse and repeat game - 6 plays around and you're done. It has the varied score ending which is mentally tiring and feels like an artificial strategy mechanic. I don't like this one much at all.

I love this game. The only thing I might consider changing is the point bonus cards... i.e. making those bonuses available to everyone and eliminating the cards. I could see that adding to the province fight (as now you're sure Player A is going to get a bonus if he/she gets Xyzyinia).

Abstract:
A complex auction game by Reiner Knizia. Players bid for provinces in Egypt, harvest for income, and build pyramids for victory points. The game is split into two eras: after the 3rd round, players remove all farmers and control markers from the board but leave all built pyramids and stones.

Round overview:
a) Reveal province cards
b) Bid on provinces
c) Buy power cards (for abilities), farmers (for harvest), and stones (for pyramids)
d) Sacrifice to Amun-Re for boni and to define harvest outcome and temple value
e) Harvest and receive income 
f) Scoring after the 3rd and 6th round

Pros:
+ Theme (seems abstract but I find it quite thematic)
+ Nice artwork for both: the old and new edition (Egypt theme, pyramids, board and cards have a clean look)
+ Bidding system: you have to bid for another province if you have been outbid (instead of raising bids back and forth, players have to make more realistic bids)
+ High player interaction: bidding for provinces, all players compete for sacrificing most money to get additional boni and they define the income of the harvest / points for temples
+ Dilemma: players work together but also have to keep their personal goals in mind
+ Crunchy gameplay where each decision matters
+ Ownership and value of provinces change after the first era which makes bidding even more interesting
+ Provinces provide different boni
+ Many paths to victory
+ Power cards give players additional options (cards are random but all of them can be useful)
+ Increasing cost (triangular numbers) of farmers, stone, or cards results into hard decision-making: what to buy and how much?
+ Each game has other combinations of provinces. Each province has different boni

Neutrals:
# Almost completely strategic except for randomly drawn power cards and randomly revealed provinces
# All money and power cards of players is hidden information (players may memorize how much money other players possess)
# No direct take-that cards

Cons:
- Best with higher player counts (especially 5 players)
- Not hard to learn but difficult to get into due to complex interaction (should be played frequently with the same people)
- New players will have trouble identifying the real value of something they are bidding on and what is scored at the end of an era
- No catch-up mechanism (can be punishing)
- Players sometimes draw very lucky / unlucky power cards (useless cards can be discarded for 1 gold)

Thoughts:
I like the theme and look of the game board with all its pyramids. What love is the intertwined interaction between players. It is not for everyone though because of its complexity. You need to play Amun-Re at least a few times to really get into the game.

Similar games:
* Ra (simpler, more elegant auction game by Reiner Knizia)
* Cyclades (dudes-on-the-map area control game that uses the same bidding mechanism)
* Goa

Player: 3-5 (best: 4-5) | Time: 90m

I found this game sort of tedious, as it doesn't allow for much player choice in strategy. Sure, you can play the auctions in different styles, and you can try to collect sets of pyramids and provinces, but I never felt like I was accomplishing anything. Imagine if halfway through a game of Ticket To Ride, the board was wiped. What's the point? There just aren't enough options to keep me interested and the game didn't click for me at all.

A great game that reminds me why knizia is a great designer. The game has solid balance, interesting differences in regions that make sense thematically. The power cards are a nice variety if a bit random. This deserves its place in the top 150. 

I didn't realize this is best with 5 - I liked it with 3 I look forward to a game with 5.

After playing with 5, the downtime is long.  Perhaps it was new players, but I'm not sure it's got long term legs.

Great game! This is what I expected to see from Knizia, I played really good games from him and some not so good. This one is one of the really good games!

Amun-Re uses a very clever bid system with limited resources use and special card plays. I enjoyed a lot the second age with the pyramids already built making the bid very intense.

Dette har vært favorittspillet vårt (kona og meg) i årevis, og er min favoritt ennå. spillet varierer for hver gang alt etter hvilke landområder som kommer med og ikke minst hvor mye penger deltagere bruker på land, ressurser og ikke minst ofring til gudene. spillet går nok ikke så raskt første gang dere spiller, men dette tar seg opp betraktelig. Vi bruker max 45 min nå. Lekker utforming også.

It took a while for this to hit the table since the minimum is three players. We ended up playing 2 players plus a dummy (crocodile standing in for hubby), and the dummy won! The design for the cards and board is not very clear and not very informative. Many fiddly steps and we had a hard time remembering to do everything that needed to be done in each step of a phase.

This game is a bidding game. It is interesting as it has a second bidding round where everything you built in the first phase goes up for sale again. Overall a fun experience.

RATING: 10
This is a really exciting and very hard game. Valuations of the regions in the six auction phases is generally very hard. The game theory in predicting the best response of other players in the sacrifice can often be really tricky. Then there is the issue of resource allocation across pyramid sets, highest on a side, most money and power cards. Really really tricky and hard valuation decisions to be made at each step. There is some luck element but not so much that you feel helpless. It is really satisfying when you make a right call in this game. Absolutely spectacular game by Knizia. 

I would be interested in trying a variant where the power cards are available to everyone at all times, meaning that anybody who owns real estate on one side of the nile gets three points, whether you own a card or not.
 
Also, we could start with one bid block and same area bid card which we could choose to judicially use once at some point over the six auction phases.

Pyramids, camels, floods, cool little chicklet pieces. I really wanted to like this game, and I do, but not as much as I'd hoped. Maybe it's because my son-in-law has always beaten me. I might improve my rating if I could get a few more plays in.

Excellent bidding and management game with an excellent theme! Another game of Knizia's finest and all fans should own this. The only drawback I can find is that it plays best with 5 and although it good with 4 there are 3 regions left outside of play. Maybe an expansion, a new map or some tweeked rules could fix that in the future though I doubt due to the game being over 10 years old now...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another winner from Knizia. I really like how the first half of the game sets up bidding battles in the second half, but the auctions never really seem to get that intense due to the bidding restrictions imposed by the cards themselves, and the red cards that can make it effectively impossible to outbid someone. Also the scoring cards vary pretty wildly and as many of them are spatial they clash with the random nature of the areas that are auctioned, making them seem more like something someone can luck into than anything. Still, an enjoyable experience.

RATING: 6
4-5(5)

I liked it ... I think I might like some of Knizia's other designs better. Taj Mahal just feels "cleaner" in that the regions are just sort of dynamically determined. The region order is random, the elephant tile is random, the advisors are fixed. In Amun Re each region has been balanced in just a particular way, which feels just a bit artificial, though it does make the regions variously interesting in different ways and to different people.

Which is, I guess, the way it has to be.

The two ages deal is interesting in how it can (or at least should) swing the auction dynamics a bit (making building in Age 1 a bit less valuable and prebuilt regions in Age 2 more valuable).

It felt like some players in particular were overloaded with power cards that they couldn't use. Yes, you can discard them for gold, but this sort of this felt very oddly ... superfluous for a Knizia game.

A game of money management really.  The auctions for land provide some tough judgments of worth, with multiple factors in play (potential income, bonus cards/blocks, temples, scoring bonuses, pyramids). Then there's how you pay more per card, farmer and block the more you buy of them.  And what income will you get from those farmers anyway?  In the offering you are reckoning the value of one, two or three resources to you and your opponents, and how this will effect income for farmers and camels.  Run short of money at a critical moment and watch your dreams of victory turn to dust. There's as much going on in this game as in Taj Mahal, yet I find Amun-Re a more accessible design. The idea of the two epochs, with everything except the pyramids swept away in-between, is a clever and thematic one.  Physical production and artwork are up to Hans im Gluck's usual standards.

RATING: 7
A good game, well-designed with a number of interesting mechanics that are worth thinking about.  Do these mechanics work?  I would say yes, they work.  Are they fun to play with?  I would say fairly so.  The auction mechanic is clever (Homesteaders uses the same one), but with my four player game, that auction mechanic felt a bit flat and non-competitive.  Too often, we would settle for essentially dividing up the four properties with little or no competition. Maybe with five players, or greater knowledge of the relative property values, it would improve.

I like the two building phases aspect of the game, wherein you clean off the board after the first phase, but leave the pyramids, reminds me a bit of the two building phases of Brass. I think the farmer and camel income systems work well enough, but it just didn't feel that compelling to think about.  And the sacrifice phase has its moments, but curiously, felt a bit underwhelming.

This is a game that presumably gets better as players better learn the relative values of each scoring system in the game.  It then, presumably, becomes a study of a scoring system, and how to "game it" best.  That to me, feels a little dry.  The game Ra is similar in this respect, but at least with Ra, the auctions feel a bit more directly confrontational and frothy.

All in all, a game that deserves to be played at least once, and clearly respected for its interesting mechanics, but curiously, this is not a game that I am immediately eager to play again after the first play, except, perhaps, with five players to see if it "heats up" a bit.

Excellent game but tough to settle on any specific strategy. One reacts to events and bids as they unfold rather than executing a plan. Tense game with some nice mechanics, and doesn't turn into a brain burner. There's enough bluff to keep raw calculations jut that...raw. The more I play it, the more respect I have for Knizia. He really knows how to develop mechanics that drive wedges between players!

I'm not a Knizia fan.  But I think this is one of his games where his overly mathmatical style is well balanced.  It's complimented by the fun bidding mechanic, luck of the draw powercards, and multiple ways of gaining victory points.  A Knizia classic that I always look foward to playing.

Played a tons of times since, over the years, and have bumped up my rating because this one's still a solid winner.  What keeps it from being higher in my mind is that I've kinda grown tired over the whole biggest pyramid fight.  I've tried to win the game without being involved in this (esp. in round two), and I've never been able to make that work, nor does it seem like it can.  But if I ever succeed at doing this, I will likely bump this up another half point or so :)

Take the auction system from Vegas Showdown, add the basic flow of Power Grid (Auction stuff, buy stuff, get paid), throw in a sacrifice to Amun-Re, and it all adds up to a solid game.  I particularly like the way the board clears midway...with all the pyramids on the board, the lands take on completely different values.

RATING: 3
After two plays, I rate it a disappointing 3 (which is giving it the benefit of the doubt).  Repetitive, kludgy, everyone has to go for the mandatory set of pyramids, too many ways to score bonuses. Most pyramids in a region seems the key to victory. Have no desire to play again.

Another Knizia Auction game. Probably the one with the best suited theme, quite a lot of calcualtion involved but it is still quite enjoyable. With five player this becomes really interesting, especially in the bidding for provinces stage, also the sacrifice stage is often higher in a five player giving bigger incomes.

RATING: 8
Egypt theme without being Egypt thematic.  I still like it, though, especially the stone and pyramid bits.  Lots of it can come down to the deck.  The timing of province appearances can drastically change valuations.  Running people up can be a real risk if the province isn't of value to you personally.  But I still like it after all these years, and I can't say the same for a lot of stuff.

An interesting game with some very clever mechanics and plenty of depth. However it is a little dry.

In other words, a good technical game but a little lacking in the fun factor.

The buying phase where each player gets to buy cards, bricks or farmers can be a little slow with each player taking quite a while to work out what is best for them and all the other players simply having to wait.

I've only played once, and then, on-line. However, this game has just that kind of "been there, done that" feeling one wouldn't expect from a guy like me who hasn't played nearly as much games as must of the BGG users have. Not only that, but the choices almost always seem a bit obvious (except for the auction, which is the only part of the game for which I could be convinced to try it again). Overall, a bad game.

UPDATE: I've played it a couple of times more, and I can see it's a somehow interesting game. It's still just "more of the same", but it's well executed. Rating increased dramatically (as it's now a game I'd like to play once in a while), to a 7.

Played several times F2F and online at SpielbyWeb. I like to think of it as a Kniziafied Monopoly. The 1st epoch is a bit samey from game to game but serves as setup for the fantastic 2nd epoch. I very much like the unique staggered bidding. Scratches a similar itch to Princes of Florence for me but perhaps not quite as good.

Az áldozás módja nagyon tetszett, és az Istenre gyakorolt hatása is. Nem csak összehányt ötletdarabok, hanem szinte a játék minden elemében összehangoltan megjelenik a víz szerepe (ezzel függ össze a jövedelem közvetlenül a termésen keresztül és a tevék levágása kapcsán is, valamint maga az áldozás is). Nagyon jó a területlicit mechanizmusa is. Egyik legjobb Knizia játék szerintem.

Ha kevés a pontunk, de van pénzünk, akkor a 2. részben még simán lehet fordítani, tehát nem dönti el az első fele végleg az eredményt, ez tetszik. Sőt ez lehet tudatos is, hiszen a pontok javát a 2. körben kapjuk. A térkép lepucolása miatt tiszta lappal indulhatunk, majdhogynem 2 külön parti (kivéve a kártyákat és pénzt).

From reading the comments, I concluded that this game is probably not for me.  I am not very fond of blind biddings as I don't like to guess what people are willing to pay in one try.

Probably the best Knizia game. Refined gameplay, love the bidding mechanism, elegant rules. Love the cost increments. I'd like a more predictable way to set the Temple value though, instead of blind bidding. The choices are fluent and the game is a pretty strong, non blabbering, bidding-driven development. Excellent game. For its time it was a perfect 10 of course.

This is one of the great Knizia classics of the past, and I've been eager to try it for over a year before finally bringing it to the table.
The game engine is indeed classic Knizia: bidding for different provinces in two epochs, combined with a clever and interesting scoring system.
It's a game I could've loved if I had discovered it a few years ago, and it is very good in the end, but it lacks something to be really great.
Disclaimer: I tried it only with three (and I understand Amun-re is not at its best with that player count) and the tentative rating is 7. Could improve after more plays with more players...

RATING: 6
The loss of ownership of your Provinces after the first half of the game is perhaps Amun-Re's best feature.  However, the random Power Card draws can easily undermine tactical play during each and every phase of the game, especially during the bidding phase.  It is also very difficult to win without Power Cards that increase your score.  Perhaps Amun-Re would be better if the Power Cards with scoring conditions were randomly distributed at the beginning or were more expensive to purchase.

I've only played the first half of one game.  It was a learning game for all involved and just taking too long.  

I did enjoy the little bit of game I played.  We want to get it back on the table but are afraid to play it with less than five.

RATING: 7
Yes, I finally have my very own Egyptian themed game and ... I like it! I enjoy looking at the board, pieces, and color combinations... it pleases my eyes. I have developed a preference for games that combine an auction element with tactical play and in Amun Re that comes into play with the bidding for province ownership and more indirectly the favor of Amun-Re. The game is thus mostly non-confrontational and thus less stressful to play for others. I enjoy confrontation though and Amun-Re has just enough outbidding and indirect attacks to keep me interested throught out the 6 rounds.

Rating after only one play with three people.  I can see how the bidding phase could be really intense with more people, or after playing more times to know which provinces are the gems.  We experienced a little competition, but mostly just tried our best to build our pyramids with the resources and power cards that were available to us.  I'd like to play a few more times to really solidify my rating on the fun little game.

Knizia is such a prolific designer that it is hard to describe a game as "one of Knizia's finest", yet that is often how I feel about Amun-Re. 

In this game the key mechanism that is repeated throughout, in multiple places and ways is the payment of money in forced steps: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc. Each raised bid costs exponentially more than what the current bidder has to pay that it makes it a tough propisition to properly evaluate the value of a property.

Then you move to buying resources. There are three kinds: Cards, Farmers, and Stones. Each of them cost more and more the more of them you buy. Again, it makes evaluating your purchases difficult, as you want to make sure your investments payoff in money or victory points. Deliciously tense money management.

Finally, there is the blind-bidding for extra resources, known as the offering. You have a choice here: Steal money and lose a resource, offer just one gold and get one resource, or offer more and try for 2 or 3 resources. It gets very difficult to determine the optimal offering as you have to try to guess what each opponent will do and how that will affect what you should offer. Finally, the mechanism of rewarding the farmers (and on scoring rounds, the temples) based on the value of the total offering, can really throw those calculations out of whack.

There is so much going on that the game could have become a brain-burner, but there never seems to be a problem with that in the games I am in. All-in-all, the intricately interlocking mechanisms and the wonderful tension in spending your money carefully makes this one of my favorite games.

Played it twice now, clever auction/area game with some varied mechanics that provide quite a lot of meat. I like it but probably won't buy it.

The auctioning mechanic (similar to Vegas Showdown) is the heart of this game and gives interesting strategic choices for players.

There is a myriad of ways to score and recognizing the best opportunities is a big part of the game. Very well designed game I wish I could get to the table more.

The consensus is that this game scales the best at five. When you do achieve that number, the game play is beautiful and engrossing.

 The auctions are among the most tense in gaming and the two generation scoring coupled with the ability of players to influence each others income during the turn end "sacrifice" leaves a lot of food for thought for players. Toss in the power cards and the chess game just got better.

This is one of Reiner Knizia's best work and highly recommended if you can get five at the table.

It's not the easiest game to just pick up and play and the theme is as pasted on as they come.  But, as is typical with Knizia, the bidding mechanics and unbalanced auctions are excellent.  Our games seem to drag on a bit and the power cards seem to have too big an impact on points at the end of the game for what is, otherwise, a calculating Euro.

All plays on SBW.  I would love to play this head to head, as I really enjoy this one.  I've been the bridesmaid on this one...and I think it's because I don't leave as much money for the second phase. I like how you work and develop a strategy throughout the game dependant on what cards you acquire and what you are able to get, province wise.  Only played with five.  

Update:  Played a few times now in person.  Like it much better as it's quicker and more fun. I think it scales very well and the board and game looks so good playing it in person.  Still a tough, tight game.

Update Sept 2012 - Played this again and I do enjoy it with any number.  I have played enough now to where it is possible to change plans during the game.  I had to force myself out of the mindset of what I had normally done and that worked well.  With others who had played this before, it's really good.  Up to an 8.5.

Another great game from Knizia.  The comparisons to Princes of Florence are not entirely unjust, but I find this game far more entertaining.  The mid game wipeout is just brilliant, there is enough carryover from the first half while somewhat abrogating the rich-get-richer syndrome of economic games.

I love everything Egyptian.  Thus, the rating may tend to be biased.  I like the bidding system and the "two" phase limit, although scoring and game play may not be immediately intuitive to non-gamers/first time players and may require more then one game to please.  Play one practice round to introduce the strategies...

Okay auction game.  At first, I wasn't a big fan, but this game has many interesting mechanics that grew on me.  Examples: the bidders get bumped around the board & if players don't give Amun-Re enough, it will be a bad crop year.  STRATEGY NOTE: focus on scoring-related power cards (early) and making sets of pyramids to get VPs, don't get caught up in an arms race for most pyraminds on the east/west side of river.

Admittedly, it was Gola's Greatest Session Report Ever Written that sold me on this game. Then it sat on the shelf for several months before I was able to play it. But I haven't been disappointed. This is an excellent, intricate game with both bidding and resource management. It doesn't feel like you're playing solitaire (like some resource management games) - rather, your previous actions affect other players for the rest of the game. Resetting the board is brilliant (and also a good time for pizza and drink refills!).

Used dice to allow you to place your tokens, get cards, and get gold.  It has a unique dice mechanic which i have not seen used in other games.  The mechanics that give you choice to construct your building and gain their special abilities can seen used in Lancaster.

Clever mix of auction and area control type mechanics with some randomness added by the possibility of the drawing of cards. As you can choose to do this or not, then the random factor is as big or small as you want.

Another nice Knizia game. Nice game theme and components. I love the bidding mechanism. What I liked less is the luck you need when drawing the power cards. Generally good game, relatively easy to teach.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a two-round resource-management game in which players bid for areas on the board (provinces), and improve upon those areas to generate money (using farmers), to get cards (special abilities and extra scoring opportunities), and to build pyramids, which are the primary source for victory points.

A detail that sets this game apart is that the game is played in two phases, the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom, and that pyramids built in the Old Kingdom last into the new, which can drastically alter a province's value.

I highly reccomend this game to players who enjoy auctions and don't mind some moderate luck.

The high rating I give it is probably also due to a bit of nostalgia because it was one of the first meatier euros I played a lot. It's a brilliant game nonetheless, but you really have to play it with five players.

Most of the time I'm not that fond of bidding games, but this one has much more interesting decisions than bidding alone. This is probably the Knizia game I like the most.

Great auction game with some pretty unique elements.  The auction mechanic is the same as in Vegas Showdown, although this game may have been first- basically if you are outbid you have to bid on something else.  It's a very good mechanism that makes the auctions fun and quick.  The game has two big phases with a reset in the middle when you move from the old to the new kingdom with only pyramids and stones staying on the board.  I love Ra and this has the same theme and same designer and both auction games.  But they're very different games so a comparison isn't as useful as you would thing.  Starts a little slow but builds a great amount of tension throughout- especially in the final rounds.

Along with Ra, one of my favorite Knizia games. Great with 5 players. It shines in two categories especially: the initial bidding for provinces in which you can attempt to trump other players, and the sacrifice to Amun-Re phase. The second half of the game (New Kingdom) offers new opportunities for scoring which benefits players that might not have done well in the first half (Old Kingdom). Spending gold during the sacrifice phase for benefits is a real challenge, as one can miss opportunities as well as overspend. Great game with each phase requiring careful decision-making. UPDATE: This was my 1,000th logged play - at BGG.CON - and a narrow 5 player victory over the likes of Marshall and Jared with a farmer strategy!

RATING: 7
A great, dynamic game. I have alot of fun every time I play it. (Unfortunately, it's a bust with many in my gaming group).

It's not a "10" because the power cards are random and draws can be very lobsided; sometimes making or breaking a game.

Should play with variant of drawing one extra power card to decrease the luck of the draw.

Update April 2013: revisited and it's just okay. The power cards DO uncork the game. Feh. Drop from 9 to 7.

My favorite of Knizia's bigger games.  A lot going on, and fun to try to go your own way and go with the flow at different times.  Too bad it only plays well with 4 or 5 players; 3-player is pretty pointless as one player will get the farmer provinces and get screwed by the camel traders.

Played this again for the first time in many years, and I was kinda surprised by how dated it felt. Reiner gives us a lot more bang for the buck in terms of complexity and interest in his more modern games, like Blue Moon City or Beowulf or even Municipium. The roughly contemporary Tower of Babel has also fared a lot better as a game with significant depth but also with a very elegant design. Amun-Re's not bad, exactly, it just feels a little clunky. Would like to try again soon to see if it was just shaking the rust off, or if it's just not one of Knizia's most durable games.

I'm less keen to get this one out than my favourite eurogames. Why? It's really just a touch too abstract - themewise - for my tastes. Okay, that does not bug me in Knizia's Ra - also set in ancient Egypt - but then that's a shorter game. Weightier games should also bring more theme to the table - at least to fully satisfy me.

That said, I might well give this an 8 after all.

Starting to tire of the phase 1- auction / phase 2- individual actions without any board interaction. There's just something about this game that really repels me. 

First, I hate drawing (as opposed to drafting) 'special ability cards' in games. It always feels like a design failure to me. It's a cheap way to create variety, flavor or false tension/complexity. You better hope you draw the power cards that fit in with what you are doing. 

It's very mundane and repetitive. The way the prices escalate, it seems every turn every player is buying 2 or 3 power cards, 2 or 3 farmers, 2 or 3 bricks, blah blah blah repeat repeat repeat.  

The auctions are horrible. I don't like that they took the Evo bidding and removed the ability to outbid immediately after someone outbids you. Very little flexibility, and plans can be ruined by irrational bidders. Whoever is able, pretty much by whim, to get a province or two cheaply during the game seems to have an insurmountable advantage.

I am always ecstatic whenever this game hits the table.  My favorite aspect of this one is the changing values of the provinces in the second epoch.  Some other great things about this game are the sacrifice and how the provinces can/should effect it and the tight econmic flow that you need to make work for you so you can score the big points in the second half.  The game really shines in all of Amun-Re's glory when every player understands what is going on and has solid play.

RATING: 8
Somehow this motley collection of mechanisms adds up to an extremely smooth and coherent-feeling game.  A great deal of it is getting to know the value of various things -- of provinces, of farmers, of building.  The values, though, tend to vary situationally, and even the "wrong" choices are never too bad. This adds up to tense, close games, and the landscape of interesting things to value makes the game feel much like a story.

I've played this twice now, and enjoyed both playings quite a bit.  The biggest drawback is that it really requires experienced players to be enjoyable (like most deep, auction games).  It's a tight game, and you must be prepared to alter your strategy based on flow of game.  Good stuff.

Finally got to play this game, it's fun!  Good 2 stages game where there is different type of planning between old and new kingdom.  The auction phase is pretty good, the best is that it is a fairly simple game but unfortunely I guess can still be ap prone.

RATING: 8
Rated "8" after one play. Not as complex as Tigris and Euphrates, but more complex than Ra. This is more than an auction game. Sure, the theme is pretty thin, but this Knizia guy sure has a knack for making unique games. 

I really like how the board is wiped clean, except for the buildings. The second wave of bidding is pretty neat after the prior round of building. And the group "sacrifice" is pretty clever as well. It's "mathy," but I enjoyed it.

Update: after too much of a wait, played this a 2nd time. Yep, still a solid 8. Love the auctions in the 2nd phase, love the balance of trying to manage money. Fairly weak theme, but a very good game.

Update: well, finally got to play this with five players, and that is clearly the ideal count. Very solid game, and I can see various paths emerging for pulling out a victory. The five player experience has really sold me on this title.

RATING: 7
I've only played this once, and it's quite piece-y and rule-y for a first time through.  As with many other games of its weight (medium in my book), figuring out the relative importance of all the various ways to score is a toughie, especially without previous experience in the game.  The power card draws seem to pretty heavily tilt the success balance in one direction or another; getting multiple power cards with contradictory (or identical) scoring conditions can make one's power card investments useless, for instance.

The biggest problem I have with the game is how there's very little information written on power cards.  The instruction book had to be passed too often.

Surprisingly uninteresting game. I've been on something of a older euro mid-weight auction kick recently and this one pales in comparison to Fifth Avenue and even Taj Mahal. The group think necessary to make the Everyone's Happy auction work is not a feature I really get into. Especially with hidden goals, there is little upside in being the one to maintain the balance.  Put this into the same category as Ra: a little bit of calculation and even less thinking. The result is an almost tensionless game of featureless decisions. Even the blind bid in the offering phase lacks excitement.

Blind bidding, random card draws of fairly widely variant value, unknowingly blind competition for geometric advantages, fiddly scoring.  There's not a lot of recommend here other than the interesting and original auction mechanism.

Enjoyable game, fairly tactical in the auctions and bidding, but has a good strategic element as well.  The cards do add some swings of fate, but nothing too drastic in my limited experience.  I'm not sure all the extra thought is worth the payoff, but I did enjoy myself and look forward to playing this some more.  Certainly doesn't push Ra out as my favorite Knizia at this point, though.

This enjoyable Knizia that feels more sprawling than most of his games. At first I was charmed by the various choices, but the more I think about this game the more I prefer RA--which gets to nearly the exact same choices with a third of the rules. That may just be my aversion to the power deck (and mechanisms like it) speaking. I have a feeling the game would be more interesting if it was just taken out of the game, which would make the auctions a little more dynamic.  In any case, I've only played a single game and would be happy to play again.  The lovely interplay of farmers vs.camels vs. sacrifice to Amun-Re was more than enough reason to explore the game some more.

I enjoy the theme of this game, particularly the way the Nile floods in the middle of the game. Very flavorful.

Amun-Re feels very 'Knizia' to me. The way you are constantly needing to evaluate what things are worth...and the way that may change to different players slightly (or more than slightly) depending on other factors. The winner will be the person who was best able to find bargains and squeeze the most out of their actions...cumulatively over time. 

I used to think this game really needed 5 players to really shine. With less, the various bonus points cards conditions get harder to meet and the auctions for the second half are not as unpredictable as they could be (since some territories will not be in the mix). What DOES get less predictable is which bonus conditions you can fulfill, so purchasing cards during the first half is more of a gamble (with under 5 players). I think the game still works fine. It also may pressure someone to pay substantially more for a 2nd half province if they know that its their only chance to meet certain bonus conditions. Anyway, now I feel like it still works fine with less than 5, its just different. 



I suspect with more playings my rating may go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is sort of an average rating, with 5 players i think it is an 8 or 8.5, with less it goes down quickly. Some great mechanics working here of course, and it tends to be more tense that one would think.

RATING: 5
Amun Re is a game that I thought was pretty snazzy when I first played it, but with the benefit of hindsight I can say that was only because I hadn't really played all that many games when this one came out.

Basically take a Knizia-style scoring system ala Ra, add several dashes of the unknown via  power cards, and serve. The main points of interest in this game are the auction for the region cards and the sacrifice at the end of the round. The auction is fairly novel, and I wouldn't mind seeing it reused in a new game. The sacrifice is quite important, and it can be a good source of income, points, and stuff if you plan ahead accordingly. That said, it's just an in the fist auction, and it's usually fairly apparent who is going to be sacrificing, and how hard.

I can't really explain why, but I find this game dull, dry, and unengaging. 

Simply doesn't stand out in my mind as doing anything particularly well...I wouldn't mind playing it again but only would if someone else needed a fifth.

Update: Homesteaders has re-used the auction mechanic and actually scales effectively (in addition to just being a more interesting game to me)...thus, Amun Re is now completely obsolete for me.

On the up side :

  My favorite game of 2003, i want to play it every time i can find 5 players !
  In any situation (poor, no balanced pyramids or majority) you can win !!!

I won two games with the less money at end !

On the down side :

- I don't recommend it for 3 players because you can have some nasty situations like all the poorest provinces : it makes a strange game with very little auctions and buys

- Some of my players find it too long

I love ancient Egypt.  A lot.  More than that.  "It goes up to 11."  Yeah, that much.  So a game about ancient Egypt is going to appeal to me.  But when it is a fantastic game as well, with a variety of strategies, just the right amount of luck, and great game play, you've hit a home run.  Anytime anywhere - I love it.

Breathtaking game design although not necessarily that much fun, as should be expected from a major Knizia release...not as innovative as LOTR or as monumental as E&T, but still a rock solid, superlative game.  A lot of the negative/lukewarm reactions seem to be the result of the exceedingly high expectations Dr. Knizia has generated for himself.  After a number of plays, the game becomes far too mathematical and systematic but it's still well worth your time if you enjoy auctions/optimization games.

Excellent game involving many aspects. Just the basics involve bidding on plots of land near the Nile. Then building farmers and pyramids. Farmers to make money and pyramids to score points. The pyramids score points three different ways. In addition you can score and do other things with a plethora of power cards. Temples also score points. There is even a second secret bidding element involved when the contributions to Amun-Re are collected. Overall an excellent game with many possibilities.

Probably my favorite game for five players.  And oddly, I think I like this game with either five players or with three, but lesser so with four players.

I did go off this one for a short while, probably from playing it too much on SpielByWeb (haven't played it there for a couple of years now).  

Sometimes the lucky nature of the power cards (do you get the right ones you need, when you need them?) can be a little off-putting, or at least I know it can be for some people.

This is a great game as long as you are playing players who understand the mechanics of the sacrafice.  Too often have I played this online, and the people just don't understand when to sacrafice and when to not.  This game often gets knocked for being slow.  That is not true.  You can knock this game out in 45 minutes easily.

I think the reason I like this game is because each time I play it, I still feel there is more I can learn and do better.  There is not set way to win, and you have to pay attention to all other players or you will get smoked.  And, lastly, you can do badly in the first round and make a comeback.

Fun and interesting bidding mechanism - my favorite part of the game.  At its best it's a tense, point grab ... but at it's worst it seems like a handful of mechanisms cobbled together into a game that ultimately feels a little more random than it should.  One of the hardest parts of the game for me is getting efficient use out of the cards without getting too wrapped up in them.

I like this one. Its different enough from the rest of my collection to get me to want to play it in a regular rotation. Streamlined rules, and fairly fast game play (barring AP). Strategy is there, though its a bit of a one-up your opponents type game. Good theme and good gameplay.

RATING: 5
This game has the honour of being the first title I ever played at a game convention after I 'got into the hobby' more or less officially; it is also the first genuine big box boardgame I bought for myself. Regrettably, Amon Ra suffered from a number of problems which might have otherwise stayed my hand, had I had the experience I now have. First of all, it's not a good game to play with 3 players, at 4 it's okay, and it's not until you play with 5 that you play 'as intended'. 5 players is a problem in my neck of the woods. Second issue: the fact that there are so many little rules and twists means that the people you play it with must be able to put up with the game for a number of times at least. So I need 4 other players with gaming experience. That's an even bigger problem.

Other than that it is a solid, if a little dry title with plenty of tiny agonising little twists, especially in the second half of the game when the presence of the pyramids and stones makes the right choice of province to buy and work not easy. You need players with a good intuitive sense of numbers and return on investments to play Amon Ra: the game will therefore not appeal to everyone. Amon Ra is not easy on newcomers: explaning the many little rules can be brutal; nor is it easy on experienced players: one mistake/upstart in your cashflow will probably cost you the victory as you don't have the time to make up for the loss. Which is of course the challenge. The little shortcomings made me decide to give Amon Ra a slightly lower rating that it otherwise would've gotten.

[b]Update[/b] Amon Ra is not a game which appears often at my table, and when it did the other day I ran into some issues which crystallised a few thoughts I'd been harbouring. My partner obtained, through sheer luck of the draw, so many bonus point power cards that it was more or less pointless to continue past the first era. (We did, though, and she won, as I'd expected.) I then noticed that there are decidedly good and bad cards. Even though a big chunk of the game is in working out when to use the right card, it is [i]very difficult[/i] to win without their point and money bonuses. The game doesn't really offer an easy alternative to transform money into VP: pyramids are really not that interesting because they don't result in major score [i]differences[/i]. (Hence the power of good scoring power cards.) With less than 5 players not all temple provinces may come out either, killing off that strategy quite effectively too; and with 5 players (ought to!) know better than to let someone get his hands on all temples. There are a few suggestions for card improvements floating around, and they certainly will help a little, but still I wonder whether it does any good for the game as a whole. It will still be a rather barren base game augmented by somewhat juicier cards.

All in all: to my current eyes, the design feels dated and limited, which, given the elaborate ruleset, is not a particularly good sign. I've downgraded the rating by 1 point.

[b]Update 2[/b] No more worrying when I will ever play this. Sad to see my first genuine multiplayer boardgame leave the collection... but sometimes a gamer's gotta do what a gamer's gotta do. Downgraded the rating by one point to reflect the final sentiment.

I like this game, but not as much as I used to.  What it comes down to is that there is very little choice.  Basically this is a money management game.  Everyone does very similar things and the person that gets good cards tends to win.

My favorite implementation of this auction mechanism (same as in f.e. Cyclades). Only play with five. The tension between farmer- and camel-provinces and the sacrifice makes for interesting decisions. However, the buying of farmers/pyramids/cards is one of the weaker points (and not that different from round to round), but it's of course in the buying of provinces - especially in the Second age - where most of the game is. Not the most balanced set of cards either, I think. Still, a good game that I got a lot of play out before I sold it.

Considering that most modern euros max out or are best with four, a possible re-buy?

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]**  El juego más duro de Knizia junto con el T&E.

Es un juego con dos tipos de subasta; una de ellas es la típica 1 2 3... y la segunda es una subasta a ciegas, la cual a pesar de las quejas de muchísima gente, hace que sea una absoluta genialidad por la consecuencias que conlleva; por ejemplo por la posible rebaja de costes en la compra de un mismo material comprado anteriormente.

Juego muy matemático, pero gracias grandes diferencias entre provincias, al cálculo de futuras ganancias, a la pequeña aleatoridad de la subasta a ciegas, a la suerte en las cartas especiales que usa, a las diferencias entre viejo y nuevo reino y a las muy diversas formas de puntuar para poder ganar, hace que sea muy rejugable.

El juego se adapta perfectamente con 3 o 4 personas pero es mejor que se juegue con 5 para que salgan las 15 provincias. Todo el mundo debería tenerlo, convéncete de ello jugando en www.spielbyweb.com[/COLOR]

First play was a five-player game which is reputedly where this game shines the brightest.  It was an enjoyable game.  Especially enjoyed the Vegas Showdown-styled bidding system.  I played poorly: didn't have enough income coming in (even though I recognized early on the need to build this) and seriously overbid on a province after which my money troubles only intensified.  Although really I didn't do too badly, as I wasn't that far behind both the fourth and third place players.  Too early to rate.  Looking forward to playing again.

I like this as a game, but am beginning to worry that it doesn't quite work.  It requires all the players to get all the lands into play, but with eveyone sacrificing to Amun Re, it is rare to see the level below the 3-4 mark, making the desert bits not produce, but the fields produce a lot.  Hm... but maybe we just need to factor that into the auction values for the various provinces.

Good gamers euro style game.  Amun-Re is a fun euro game based on two ages of Egyptian history.  Players strive to erect pyramids, farm, and gain advantage and flexibility for future turns through money and card acquisition.  At the end of the first age, everything is wiped out except for the pyramids.  The second phase of the game starts and the players erect more pyramids, farm and work at gaining more cards and money.  Scoring is done twice in the game and the player with the most points wins.  Amun-Re is a good, fun euro style game with little down time.  It plays in less than two hours and is ideal with 4 or 5 players.  Also the bidding process for territories in the Egyptian empire is innovative and creates a good dynamic which players have to adjust to depending on how the other players play. This is a very good game for any gamers collection that likes semi easy fun euro style games.  This is one of my top 50 euro style games of all time.

I love the interplay in the "economics" subsystem and even the blind bidding appeals to me here.  Trying to set yourself up for power card bonuses, while balancing your money and competing with your opponents for bonuses is huge fun.

This title is still growing on me, especially with the SpielByWeb implementation now available.  With money and # of power cards open in that implementation it changes the feel a bit and I think it makes the game even better.

It's dry. I don't mind some dry stuff as long as the mechanic is good. It is. Minus one very big mistake. Too random to formulate a strategy. It's very tactical, but while sometimes I don't mind tactical games, but the scoring nature is against tactical play, which I find counter-intuitive. I don't feel like I have any control in the game, so I hate it.

RATING: 8
Mechanically, Amun-Re doesn't feel particularly innovative. All of its singular parts - triangular auctions, income management, infrastructure development, blind bidding, and so on - have been used, and used well, in other designs. But it is extremely tightly constructed. The purchase mechanic magnifies the angst involved in making big moves, the sacrifice system creates an interesting tension and narrative, and the board control reset in particular works really well here to ratchet up the intensity of the later auctions.

There is a huge disparity in the relative strengths of the various power cards, though, adding an unfortunate element of luck into the mix; poor draws can kill an otherwise well-played game. The replayability also suffers as players become more experienced, especially the first half of the game; the relative values of provinces stabilizes and the auctions become much less interesting until the board reset. But in general it's a well-made game and the first few plays after you "get" the game are spectacular.

RATING: 6
Good game, but I found it did not live up to the hype.  Far too many fiddly paths to victory.  It takes longer to learn than to play, which is a good sign if it's a strategy issue.  In this case, it's not the strategy that is rules-heavy, it's the special cases and exceptions that come up with each of the symbols and territories.  By the time you soak all of that in, you don't have a clue strategy-wise.  But it doesn't matter, you have to modify your strategy on the fly anyway, based on which territories and which cards come up.  Fun but not great.

Yet another auction based Knizia game. I like how everything falls together in this one and think the theme is better than lots of his games. An interesting auction mechanic (I think done for the first time, but it has since shown up in other games) and positional board play, among other things, make this a long time favorite.  Doesn't come out much any more but every time it does I think 'why don't we play this more?'

A solid, slightly heavier-than-normal Knizia game.  The bidding mechanics are important but not as dominant as in Ra or Medici.

When I first read the rules, I thought this game was too short. Like there aren't enough rounds. I couldn't be more wrong... This game is extremely well balanced and a lot of fun to play. Because each round is split into 3 different parts, the gameplay feels very varieted.

Good player interaction, good bidding mechanism. Sacrifice round forces players to consider the status of the other players in the game when making decisions. Always up for a game.

A little soured on the game now. You really have to count on other players to play rationally in order to make good progress in the game, particularly in the sacrifice. If players do not protect their interests here when their interests coincide with yours, you're kind of in a bad way. New players do not play rationally.

Another one of Knizia's gems from the old days when he still had a knack for making brilliant games. Although, in saying that, Amun Re is not nearly as tense and exciting as his best games and as such it probably drags a bit too much. You could do much worse than play it, but there are better games with similar mechanics around as well.

This was the first game I ever played at the Gathering.  Ever.  You'd think it would hold a softer spot in my heart for that.  I do like it.  It has several very intriguing elements in it.  I think the game is simply a little meatier that I am usually in the mood for.  Or maybe it doesn't have the type of social interaction that I want from a longer game.  Who knows!  I have only played is sporadically and I always like it, but it has never swept me off my feet.

Maybe a 7 that loses a point for bad components.  The pyramids are bad enough, but the double pyramids that you can only tell are doubles when standing are horrible.  Besides that, the power cards vary too much in usefulness (3-4 dollars, vs 5% your total score?) and the choices are actually pretty limited (max farmers, max cards, bricks you can afford each round).  Naw, it's definitely a 4.

This is a game of trying to optimize where you allocate your resources for maximimum points.  A challenging game that I enjoy.  However there isn't much player interaction.  Also, there is some luck in the drawing of power cards.  A opportune card is often the difference between winning and losing.

Amun-Re is another one that has been at the edge of my perception for a while, without me ever quite playing it. I’ve been open to trying it, I was just unwilling to purchase it before trying it, due to my shift in tastes away from the sort of games that Knizia offers. I got a chance to play it last weekend though, and found it to be rather interesting, particularly with the fact that pyramids that you build during the first round are still around to help anyone who wins the province during the second round and the variable player powers provided both by the cards and the provinces won. Still, despite my enjoyment of the game I do not think it is one I need to own, as I suspect I would rarely if ever get it on the table in the face of other games that are of greater interest to me.

The good doctor is back in Egypt with a meaty boardgame that has a lot to like about it.  Players play 2 "turns" - the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom.  Each turn consists of purchasing via Evo-auction a province, then developing the province with farmers and pyramids.  It all costs money, so you have to concentrate on income also.  At the end of the first half, ownership is removed, yet the pyramids remain!  A bit of down time whenever a player takes power cards, which is exaggerated with more players, however this is clever stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun Euro game, and I love the mechanics for the sacrifices to Amun-Re.  It is all pretty well balanced, and not all that many choices to the point where new players or non-gamers will be confused.  I think it's a fun pseudo-gateway game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The jury is in, and this is officially a stinker. This is the most heartless, robotic and transparently mechanized of Knizia's auction titles. It feels like a prototype of a game that was made 5 years before Knizia's amazing auction games... but in fact it was released after. Boring, klunkly, unintuitive, and uninspired. Has pretty pyramid pieces though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Will require more plays to rate properly. It's provisionally a 7 as it's obviously good. The heaviest of the Knizia larger box games that I have played. Imagine you need the higher player count for this one to shine. The rules really aren't that complicated, but subtle and difficult game play emerges from them, like all the best Knizias. However this is a shade harder than the others I have played. The power cards are an interesting and at first seemingly random addition to the game, though once familiar with them they aren't so bad. How much do I offer Amun re? It's uncertain. These older 'euros' are so much more interesting than their modern equivalents.

RATING: 6
A good Knizia game from his best period, but not one of the classics from that same period.  The auction mechanism is interesting, but the most interesting thing here is how the game resets itself halfway through apart from the pyramids, all of which remain.   The game has some parallels in its structure to Wallenstein/Shogun where you have 3 identical rounds, followed by scoring, then halftime, then do that again.   The scoring is a bit tight and a bit coarse.   Drawing the action cards feels pretty lucky as most of them aren't usually what you are looking for.   

I have some issues with the TMG production in the 2017 version.   The pyramids are the same color as the board, and therefore hard to see.  The double pyramids are still really annoying as you can't see the second pyramid from the back - it just looks like one.  The number of pyramid and stone bits is quite low, and you constantly have to make change, which you are doing all game long with the money cards too.   The auction cards could pop a little more off the board.   It definitely is a $30 game in a $70 box.

Végre ki tudtam próbálni. És tetszett. Vhol a 8-9 közt van, inkább 9-hez közel, de azért csak 8-t, mert azt olvastam, hallottam, h bár 3-5-ös játék, de csak 5 személlyel jó. Ha ez így lenne, akkor nem érdemel 9-est összegészében, még ha 5 személlyel meg is érdemelné.
Licitálás területekért, amik aztán a tied lesznek és adnak ezt azt, de csak a 3. fordulóig, akkor félúti értékelés, majd söprés. A második 3 forduló ugyanez -azt leszámítva h félidőben nem mindent takarítunk le, így a második félidő más alapokkal kezdődik-.
Licitálás nem csak területre: hanem a fordulón belül még egyszer, ezúttal azért, h milyen értéket képviseljenek dolgok /van akinek a kicsi, van akinek a nagy a jó/, és egyúttal lehetőség a kezdőjátékossá válásra.
Jól van szétbontva a két licitálás, közben épp annyi cselekedet, ami szükséges.
Aztán persze spec. kártyák bolondítják meg az egészet, s mint a legtöbb ilyen játéknál, érdemes abból minél többet felhúzni: hasznos lehet.
Szóval jó volt.

Amun-Re is a good interesting game. The fun part of Amun-Re is when you bid for the land and the sacrifice. To figure out how much each land is worth to you and compare its worth for the other players is amazing. This can do deeper than your average board game.

At first, I would always lose at this game. I have many games played and havn`t won once in many years. Oddly enough, my last two plays are two wins...one point win in both cases. I guess it depends on who you play against.

I don't know why I often lose. I guess I can't handle my expenses in this game compared to other games I've played which has the auction/bidding mechanic. 

I still have fun when I play this game even if I do poorly. Though, I know I could have played better when I have a poor performance. I always look for ways to do better and calculate my expenses, hopefully for a win. 

Having two rounds in the game and the fact the pyramids stays in the 2nd round makes it very interesting on how you bid for land. More so than in the first round. Especailly if you have 3 pts cards in your hands at the start of the 2nd round. Lots of things to consider and think about. Lots of different possibilities.

Maybe there is a better way on how to spend your money more wisely if you want a chance to win. How much for the land your want? How much to sacrifice?

Lots of choices on how much you spend your money in Amun-Re.

Something that I enjoy more now than I did at the begining. The game has grown on me with more plays. A real treat!

I played this two times on SpielByWeb just before they took it off. I'm not particularly drawn to auction games, but there was something about the way the different styles of auctions meshed together in this game that I really enjoyed. I would definitely enjoy getting the chance to play this in the future. Not sure how my opinion might change with more plays.

An excellent game with multiple paths to victory (or defeat), and plays particularly well with 5 players (less well with only 3). Extremely well balanced, and seems to produce tight games with skill and strategy being much more important than luck - which is present in the game but in a small way. Highly recommended!

RATING: 6
This is a highly regarded auction game played in two phases.  It kind of reminds me of Brass in that respect that some things get cleared off the board after the first phase and others remain in the second phase.  The difference is that the things that are left on the board in Amun-Re belong to no one and will be fought over in auction.  Amun-Re was the innovator in games that use the "you've been outbid so you have to bid on a different item" that's been found in Cyclades and Homesteaders.  I enjoyed that aspect of the game and the asymmetrical regions that players bid on.  I found the end game point cards and the randomness of the card to be of an annoyance to me.  Yes me, the card gamer, is complaining about card draw.  It was really annoying that after a person wins an auction that contains few/no farmer fields that I draw into a 9 farmer bonus point card or if I focus on getting the temples the, I draw no +/- 3 power cards.  Another disappointment in the cards is that you can go through the whole deck of cards and then be screwed out of getting point cards in phase two.  Overall, this is an interesting game, that could get better in my eyes with repeated plays but I'm not going to keep it, because with 5 people I would much rather play BSG, El Grande, or perhaps Game of Thrones.

I'm so happy that I succeed to get the old gorgeous Rio Grande Games edition, as the new edition made by Super Meeple is really ugly: the game board looks disorderly, the province cards look dull and I don't like the meeples.

Ok, this game is a strongly-designed game (I know you're thinking there's a huge but coming up, and you're right) but I felt Amun-Re's decisions were slow, somewhat limited and really not that rewarding for the time frame of the game. The most interesting mechanic of Amun-Re is abandoning your accomplishments mid game, only to re bid on them. All considered, I just didn't think the time investment was worth the rewards of playing.

Excellent auction and resource management game that is more rich in theme than Ra. Very tense and exciting game where every action of a player elicits a reaction from the other players.

Amun Re is a good, solid game. I can myself going gaga over this back when it first came out, but now I see it like Tikal - a solid game that's just not as sexy as the new stuff that has more things going on. I'm not sure what to do with this one as I think it handles 5P extremely well, but not sure it will ever get requested. I think I'll hold onto for a while and see how it fares against the other 5P options in my collection before I decide to do anything with it.

Disappointed with this. Way too many mechanisms shoved together, so lots of rules to understand first time. And lots of different scoring mechanisms, and lots of things with different values/weights. The fact there are a dozen action cards should tell you how complex this game is. I did like the auction mechanism, with the prices fixed on the cards. I very nearly won, but that wasn't totally through good judgement. I have my own copy, but it's going to stay wrapped.

RATING: 9
I must be partial to Egyptian themes.  Knizia's games often shine when bidding is involved, and I like how the pyramids remain on the board between the old & new kingdoms.

The game seems open to a variety of strategies.  I don't think the bonus cards are as imbalanced as most people say.  While they give a nice bonus for scoring, they don't provide crucial help along the way.  The non-bonus cards are able to be used throughout the phases of *every* round.  This game is best with 5 players since ALL regions are used (and with that, every bonus card will have meaning).  One of my favorites from Knizia!  This rating applies for 5 players.  Grade: A

I enjoy the game and admire its mechanics but it doesn't seem to have the "must-play" syndrome that a lot of great games have and doesn't hit the table very often.  For some reason, Vegas Showdown, which uses a similar bidding mechanism, garners far more enthusiasm.

RATING: 5
It's yet another uninspired game of bidding over arbitrary point conditions, except to make things worse it has high-impact power cards thrown in to potentially invalidate any real bidding strategy.

I read the reviews and was both cautious and hopeful, and I made sure to get my fare share of cards so I wouldn't bitch about them afterwards, and while I zoomed ahead during the old kingdom as the cards I picked up complemented my territories, I just as quickly lagged behind as I drew useless cards during the new kingdom.

Throw into the mix a noisy board that's tedious to count income and scores, and the whole ordeal is not for me.

I'll probably play at least once more just to be sure, but I can't imagine it'll improve.

RATING: 8
[Auction/Action, Investment, Economic, Egyptian] {5P:10, 4P:6, 3P:4} Yet another Knizia design with mindbending gameplay and scoring. This time, players are Pharoahs, and work to build great pyramids and offer great sacrifices to the sun god Amun-Re. The theme isn't as well-integrated as it is in Euphrat & Tigris, but it still works well with the support of the excellent Hans im Gluck production. It follows an auction/action format similar to The Princes of Florence, with a couple of interesting twists. Amun-Re is less accessible than Euphrat & Tigris, but it grows on you with every play. *** UPDATE: Not as mindbending as I initially believed (see Taj Mahal and Modern Art for that) but still an excellent resource management and planning game. Stays a nine at the moment, though I doubt that it'll be a ten... *** UPDATE: Finally settled on an '8' for Amun-Re. It's a great game, one that I'll gladly play anytime, anywhere, but as far as auction/action goes it's a notch behind PoF, which remains the king of its game format on the strength of elegance and theme.

RATING: 9.5
One of the earliest games I own and probably still my favourite game.  I've fallen out of love with quite a few of my Knizia games over the years but not this one.

For me, this is the most rounded 5-player game I own.  It is best with 5 (it does work ok with 3 or 4) as there are 15 territories and these are all utilised over 3 eras in a 5-player game.   In games with fewer players some of the territories are left unused and although this means no two games will play out the same I find I prefer 5-players.

The Board graphics and components are excellent and create enough basic theme to avoid the 'pasted on' slurs.
I've often been asked what we are playing when in a public area such as a Cruise ship lounge.

I might have to pick up a second copy as we always take this one on holiday/vacation and it's starting to look a little aged! :)

Most of the BGG users who I follow for having similar tastes to my own give this game a very high rating, but I just can't muster that much enthusiasm for it. No doubt, some of the problem comes from it being an auction game that my group only breaks out every few years, which makes for weak evaluation of the relative worth of the things you're bidding on, and thus weak play. That's auction games for you. But I also don't think there is very much room for especially interesting play. And the power cards are kind of annoying. Not many games have their optimal player count at 5P, though, so it has that going for it.

RATING: 8
Take a great auction mechanism, constantly shifting goals depending on what the other players do, and a fair shot of double-guessing. Add in the typically multi-layered scoring opportunities, and you have one of Knizia's greats. The reset point at the halfway mark in particular looms over every action in the first half of the game because the pyramids you commission now might be the ones that guide your opponent to greatness later on.

No doubt some people will find this dry and mechanical, too, but from erecting pyramids through sacrifes to Amun Re and the harvests at the mercy of the Nile, all the elements make a lot of sense thematically.

My first rating - 8 - has been elevated to 9 after 3 plays. The more I have played this, the more I like it. There's LOTS to think about each turn. Game play is really very simple, but the decisions are tough. My "9" rating is based on my love for BIG games (games with big boards and lots of bits) - as in E&T, Piratenbucht, Settlers (I know there isn't a game board - but in essence there is), Capitol, Wallenstein, Liberte, Princes, etc., etc. There is much interaction between the players which I also enjoyed. It has made its way into my top 10 and is closing in on top 3!
Just played it again after a 3-year lay-off. It is still an excellent game!

I'd been looking forward to playing Amun-Re, as Knizia's abstracts always stir me in the right way. Yes. Abstract. But, I enjoy his pasted-on themes regardless. Sadly, I was a bit let down. When I heard read the rules, I could not get a handle on what to do. There was a huge disconnect between all the scoring options. I feel Ra has a lot more symbiosis. Anyway, by the last round I was truly getting the game and actually felt it was a very tight game and an interesting approach to auctioning and purchasing. In that, I felt much warmer to it by the end and I think a second play would garner my favour a bit more. However, I can't remember the last time that I was so _bored_ watching other people's turns. Even with 4 players it took a bit of time to get back around, and watching other player's analyze their options was uninteresting to say the least. As such, I think there are games like this (even ones that Knizia has made) that have a lot more tension to them, even while you are waiting for your turn. I wouldn't refuse a game if suggested, but not one I'm really enamored with.

Amun Re is a unique gaming experience.  Although the auction ultimately becomes the primary influence in the game, as it determines which areas people control, the implementation of power cards, plus the addition of the second dynasty (forcing everyone to relenquish power over previously controlled areas)makes the auctions play out most differently than in other auction based games.  Balancing your economy, and building between dynasties is key. The blind bidding element between each round, for the favor of the gods, is also added dimension that makes balancing ones decisions more difficult.  Knizia again creates a tense environment by making us want to do more than we can, but also adding in more things we have to eventually be aware of.  This game strikes a nice balance between long term strategy and quick decision making.  A great game, but it falters increasingly with fewer players than the maximum.

Update:  This downgrade in rating is largely due to the lack of interest this game garners with myself and fellow gamers in my group.  I have not played it in a while and that should say something.  The down slide could be temporary as it may eventually find it's way back to the table and inspire a lift, but until then ... down to a 6.

I believe this is Knizia's most thematic game. The game itself is about the golden age of Egypt when countless pyramids are being built to honor the pharaohs. Players bid for provinces, develops the province and build pyramids. I personally like this game due to the unique bidding mechanic and the intense competition that every turn presents.

Rating after 2 unfinished games on spielbyweb.
There's ,,something" in this game that makes me want to play it and wait for my round. There are only 2 places for interaction: the bidding phase and the sacrafice phase. Both kick ass - being great and subtle. Managing money and power cards is also nice thing and makes the game thrilling. Surprisingly light.

EDIT

Few games at SBW.
GREAT! Best with 5.

After first (unfortunately 3p) face-to-face game. Really good. The new/old kingdom mechanism is awesome!

EDIT
Great, but somehow it wasn't played enough. The downtime was too huge. Sold.

RATING: 8
Now that I've played more than once, I'm starting to understand it more.  I'm terrible at managing my money, and my competitive (read stupid) nature makes me want to over-bid just to keep provinces away from my friends.

RATING: 8
Great auction mechanism. But the board art appears to be drawn by an elementary school child. Why must it be so butt-ugly? Looking at the game does not entice you. 

Update- Picked up a coy of the 2017 edition- what a difference! Beautiful & blows away the older Rio Grande edition. The board and pieces really entice one to play what is essentially an engine building racing game set in ancient Egypt- that is very sound. Not Knizia’s best but enjoyable enough. Worth keeping for now due to the newer edition.

A good game, with a few options on your turn and a good bidding mechanism for areas, which keeps that part of the game interesting.

You can be limited in terms of points scoring depending on what cards you are able to collect (you can chose to gain cards as part of your turn, at a cost, but you are given them blind, and some give you scoring opportunities and others give other advantages).  You are able to adjust your strategy if you get appropriate cards early enough, but collecting cards later on can just lead to frustration.

There are ways around the cards, but sometimes it takes too much time or money and is no guarantee of getting what you need.  I find this aspect of it a bit too problematic for my liking.

Had a great time with this game.  I really like the auction then purchase mechanic of Reiner games and it is done very well in this game.  Lots to think about and do but not overly complex, you have auctions, purchases, sacrifice, and harvest.   A very fun part is half way through you have to auction all the territory you just owed and built pyramids on so somebody else could now own and score off of your pyramids or visa-versa.  Very good game.

Certainly a well-produced and visually appealing game, that challenges players to control the right provinces, acquire income and build pyramids - it does have its virtues.  Obtained a copy via Geek Trade. Five players for this kind of game is tough to bring about, and it deserves to be played by players who know what they're doing (experience with the game) - a tall order.  Traded for Dos Rios. But, Dos Rios was traded for an incomplete copy of Hoity Toity-thanks Andy! However...

A game group member sold me his nearly mint copy for $15 and I couldn't pass it up.

Many thanks to my gaming friend Steve who let me borrow his copy, to try the game out.

Interesting game, where the theme really relates to and enhances game play. One of Reiner Knizia's games that really works.

There is a lot going on in this game at all times.  There are many interesting and unique game mechanisms, so it takes a game or two to master.  Once you do though, it is a fun, fascinating game with the best Egyptian theme I've seen.

The steep learning curve and the long game length (90 minutes is definitely an understatement of game length) make it one that can't just be pulled out to play at any time.

A wonderful blend of some other game mechanics: bluffing, biding, majorities and some intricated ways to score ("a la Knizia"). Its nice auction mechanics are present in more modern games like Cyclades, Last train to Wendsleydale or Homesteaders. One of the best Knizia games, youll need experience to win at it. The only related luck factor are the special scoring cards but is not a big deal and no game will be decided just because of luck. It takes one hour and a half for experienced players and its only drawback is that its a game for just five players, no more, no less.

After a number of playings on SbW, I've decided I like this game well enough, but it is not one of my favorites.  The individual aspects are all interesting enough, but somehow it doesn't all fit together in a way that would make a truly great game.

Update:  After many more playings on SBW, I've upped my rating from 7 to 9.  It took me a while to 'get' this game, but now that I do it is a lot of fun.  I'm not the kind of analytical thinker that does best at a game like this, but I find it challenging and appreciate it the more I play it.

It also seems to work very well in the SBW format.

We weren't able to play a complete game, just the first age, so I can't comment fully on the whole game. My initial impression from the mechanics and gameplay is good, however. I've always been a sucker for computer RTS games that involve gathering resources and building, and this game is similar in some respects to that model. When we added up victory points at the end of the first age, I was within striking distance of those ahead of me, but I'd also stretched myself thin on resources. One player, interestingly, focused heavily on farming and economy in that first age and was thus way behind on victory points but well ahead financially and in a position to take whichever province he wanted in the bidding round. It's a very intriguing game. Until I can play through to completion, I'll reserve my final judgment, but as of now, it's an appealing game with a nice level of complexity.

Personal: auction, management, bidding... 6 times, seem quite simple. The auction is great, fixed amounts and no option to outbid if you are taken out. Management and bidding are ok and easy for casuals. Only con I could say is you need 5 players to play this. You also have the clen up of the board after the 1st score (3rd turn) that makes the auction better for the last 3 turns
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A well-crafted game that ranks up among the best of Knizia's many auction/resource management games.  It's a tense game that requires players to plan ahead and budget carefully.  Amun-Re got a lot of play early, and I'm still happy to play it, but don't feel the urge to suggest it. Anyone who has basically mastered it will usually crush beginners, and so the fun isn't there if one player is better than everyone else. And after 8 games of this, I've yet to lose. It's the Puerto Rico problem. In theory, I like both games a lot. In practice, I won't suggest either one unless I find another player or two who can make the game challenging again.

The best Knizia game since Eufrat &amp; Tigris and LotR, although it has nothing to do with this game. Beutiful design and clever system, although he has borrowed from different systems. The bidding is like in Evo, although the overbid *must* bid in another province, when it&#039;s his turn around the table again. The bids are 1-3-6-10-15-21-28-36 for each province, as well as the payment for the number of bought resources (cards, stones and workers). I&#039;m told that this system exist in in Hare &amp; Turtoise. Highly recommended.

A fascinating game. Players aren't usually buying things; they are buying opportunities. They're buying fixer-upper properties in the hopes of scoring lots of points. Amun-Re uses a different auction system than Knizia's other games, what I think of as the "best offer" auction: bids increase according to pyramid scoring, and if you are overbid, you have to bid on something else. This makes players consider how much they are willing to pay at the outset because they may only get one shot.

THEN, after you play the first half of the game, there's another half where the board is almost fully reset, except players get to keep their cash and cards, and then they rebid on the properties they improved in the first half. This is just brilliant. There's also a collective blind bid to reach a certain threshold that is tense and awesome.

All told, this is just a fantastic game.

Just don't find that I play this enough to rate it any higher than a 7. I think I am beginning to find that the scoring in some of Knizia's games, while well designed, seems a little convoluted. I do like several aspects of the game: the balance between scoring and building up income, the tension surrounding the race for the most pyramids, the extra actions that come from the sacrifice and how they can affect pyramid majorities.

Game feels empty without 5 players. One of the few 'best with full 5' games (PoF, El Grande) I have really felt I am disappointed to play with fewer than 5. Without 5 you don't use all of the territories and this can really change the game.

RATING: 8
This is a really well designed game and shows Knizia when he is the best. There is a lot of room for both tactics and strategy with a pinch of lucky draws.

It works great with 4 or 5 players, but it isn’t really a good 3-player game.

Sixteen face-to-face plays, plus about twenty online. A rich, complex game that allows for a certain amount of strategic thinking without ever feeling heavy or draggy. It's bound to seem a little awkward and opaque at first, but once you've played a few times the mechanisms all click together and the game takes on a life of its own--like Ra, there's a weird feeling of bounce to the system where it seems like the players are participants in a larger story that's playing out on its own. Spooky!

Unlike some people, I think it plays just as well with four as it does with five. Three is a little weird because it can be much harder to pull off the power cards, but on the other hand it moves really quickly.

Played 10  Best with 5. This game goes down well with our games group. It is the first game to my knowledge that we have ever played on two consecutive weeks.

It will never appeal to none gamers but it really hits the spot within our games group. April 04

*UPDATE* 20th play and I am still loving this game. I don't think I have ever played with 3, all but a couple of my plays have been with 5. As a group we are fully focused on this favourite, it is a game where you feel very satisfied if you pull off the win.

Always exciting. Many ways to score and quite a lot of interaction. This has arguably more "flavour" and theme than any other Knizia game and doesn't feel dry at all. The game keeps exciting me after many, many plays. It might very well strike a more "ideal" balance between strategy and tactics (at least from my point of view) than any other game out there. I feel that I have a very good sense of the options available for strategic play, and yet I haven't quite "figured the game out" by identifying a set of key "ways to play" that would always work. I usually can't tell what my final scoring position will be until the very end, and yet the game doesn't feel "random". If a game can be "intuitive", Amun-Re certainly is.

When I said that Egizia feels like it's from 2003, this game is exactly what I meant. Even though I hadn't played Amun-Re yet and so didn't know I was talking about it.

I don't like all the work of turning coins into points as efficiently as possible, even though the auction creates lots of discontinuities and so maybe calling this an efficiency game isn't even right. And I am lukewarm on this style of one-shot special power cards. So what did I actually like about this? Hm. Adapting plans based on which areas come up for auction together was interesting. And I won, that probably helps too.

Only have one play in (with three players), so my thoughts will need more time to develop.  However, I rather enjoyed my one play of this game.  The reset halfway through the game adds an interesting twist, as one player can inherit the results of all the hard work of another player.  Plus, it has the Best Session Report Evar.  (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekforum.php3?action=viewthread&threadid=24697)
UPDATE:  I have several more plays under my belt now, and I agree with those who say that this game is better with more players.  Ideally, you want the full complement of five players.  But, when you do, it's a fine building game.  Of course, now my wife is schooling us regularly when we play....

Amun-Re is an area building game that masquerades as an auction game...or perhaps the other way around. Kiniza created something profound here. In Amun-Re, players auction to build up territories they control with various point scoring opportunities, but there are many decision points, offering twists and turns along the way. Money is the sole currency for all actions. Players must choose to use money to bid high for a location or use money to purchase point generation or use money to determine the nile level that decides what how much each item will score. Every choice a player commits to lessens their power to influence the others. Mix this with a unique bidding system where any player can force bids to increase for all or abruptly end the round, Amun-Re is a great system that is difficult to replicate. Card abilities can be random, but if everyone focus on drawing cards, much of the game is in everyone's control.

Typical point hoarding game.

Nothing unusual or exciting about this game. There are plenty of much better games out there.

At least the only luck element in the game are the cards.

Probably my favourite auction game set in Egypt by Reiner Knizia.

Very clever auctioning and purchasing mechanisms, with some interesting scoring too. Definitely better with the full 5 players, as otherwise some of the provinces don't come into play.

Not a bad game, but it's essentially an auction game with not many different strategies and significant luck of the draw. Also, I find it a little dry (no pun intended) and the artwork is lackluster. The plastic or resin pyramids (depending on the version) look pretty nice on the board.

Played only once and need more times to give a good rating.  Lots going on and hard to see what is important early on.  I didn&#039;t like Ra either until repeated playings and the game grew on me and this may be the same kind of game.  I do like the separate kingdoms where you may not want to overbuild in the 1st kingdom for fear of giving another player a juicy spot in the second kingdom.  Although the luck of the Power card draw seeme to really handicap one player and help a couple of others.  If the Power Card variation could be straightened out then this may become a 8 or 9 for me.

I like this game more and more each time I play it. When I first got it I thought that there wasn't much to this game, but this is one of those rare games that is far richer than it looks. Had to boost my rating after a playing a few more games and seeing how differently the game plays with each new session.

Essentially an auction game with some elements of resource management, Amun-Re didn't really click with me. It's well designed (natch; it's a Knizia), but I didn't find it engaging; and you can get screwed by the province draw and (especially) the power cards. Felt similar, but vastly inferior, to Goa.

Played it again after many many years. Well, it wasn't my most loved game back in the day and this didn't change.

Actually it's all about the cards you buy (draw), while you don't have any control over it. You may draw cards you'll never be able to use, while others get what they need. This will pretty much leave you behind and that's the main problem.

RATING: 5
Insanely dry with limited scoring strategies. A soulless game where "elegance" has prevailed over fun. The auctions are dry and discourage bidding against one another except in limited circumstances.  The cards are overly random.  It is essentially pay for a chance on 3 points or a chance on a free item (farmer/card/etc.)  I recognize that it is a tightly designed game, I just did not have very much fun playing it.  I think you could design it to play in about 45 minutes and have the same amount of fun.  Nothing innovative or interesting here.  The board looks like crap and the cards should just have text on them but instead have weird language independent graphics on them.  More of the same - smoothly designed no theme barely fun crap from reiner knizia.  What happened to the guy that designed E&T??

Was a little complicated to play for the first time.  Definitely intimidating for beginners/non-gamers ("I have so many choices; what should I do now?").  Will take more time to come up with good strategies and tactics.

I played a 3-player game, and found it less interesting because there is less competition for auctions.  Also, we never hit a harvest of 3 or 4, because we spent so little on the sacrifice.  In that kind of low-spending environment, the "8-gold caravan" province is worth a lot!

This is a really neat game with a lot of options that face you each turn. There's never enough turns to get exactly what you want done and the first and second dynasty re-alignment is really cool. Bad bonus card draws can be a hinderance, but there are other ways to catch up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
I definitely enjoyed this on a first solo play but don't feel I have a good enough feel for it to give a fair rating yet.  Probably somewhere between 6-7, at a SWAG.

Updated after 2nd solo play: this is yet another interesting Knizia auction variant game, with a decent theme, but I simply don't like it as much as Taj Mahal.

Perhaps it's the two scoring periods, or the randomness of the important power card bonuses, or the fiddliness of the golden ratio bid values, but somehow this one seems to play longer, with less bang for the buck, and isn't even as pretty to the eye.

Definitely not a bad game, just not my favorite among the Knizia auction games, unless played with 5, where it shines better.

After 3rd play (with 5 players) raising this to a 7.25, but this is conditional on a full player count.

Donated 1st copy, obtained replacement.

Amun-Re incorporates auctions and hand management with limited amounts of risk-taking to create an Egyptian dynasty to weather the ages.

Bidding as one of the main mechanism, and a score track around the board: looks like Knizia signature. And yes. It is a Knizia game.

Bidding to get a situation on the board and a first shot at the next round. Bidding to maximize or minimize the gain by sacrificing or lowering the sacrifice. Beside the distribution of the cards, power or regions, most of the game play is interacting with other players.

(03/2009) Interesting bidding mechanism, with category dominance for scoring, much like other Knizia games. The game drips with theme, as players build pyramids, till farmland, and make sacrifices to Amun-Re, only to see everything except the pyramids get wiped away due to the passage of time. Players then rebid to gain control of these pyramids to build more pyramids in a second "epoch", much like in Ra. I rate it a "7".

Update (02/24/11) 3 plays: the game is slowly getting traction in our group, as players get familiar with the rules and fascinating gameplay. Players competitively bid for various kingdoms, much like trying to buy primo beachfront property, trying to get the best deal. This is classic Knizia: "You don't want to bid too low, but you don't want to bid too high; you want to bid just right..." Goldilocks-style bidding. This also applies to spending money to improve the kingdoms with pyramids and farmers. Because of the progressively increasing costs of power cards, farmers, and stone (to build the pyramids), you can't go all out, because then you would not have enough money to make a worthy sacrifice to Amun-Re. If you win the sacrifice bid, Amun-Re will shower you with gifts to possibly take the lead in one or several scoring categories. If frugal or stingy, you can try to pull everyone else down, but also not get much in terms of progress. Interesting implementation of the "Prisoner's  Dilemma".

Great game. Its division between the Old and New Kingdoms gives it a structure quite different from most games, the bidding allows for  a lot of "I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me!" moments, and I love the building aspects because, well, I like building things.  Certainly one of the best Knizias I have played.

RATING: 7
Don't get the jump to the New Kingdom as they didn't build pyramids then.  Rather than skipping a huge chunk of history in the 1st Intermediate, Middle Kingdom and 2nd Intermediate periods why didn't they just say that the Old Kingdom ends then after the chaos of the 1st Intermediate Period life went back to normal and pyramid building continued in the Middle Kingdom.  Small point but if you know your history a bit grating.

Fantastic, Unlike most bidding games of this genre, there are 2 distint times during the round where players can interact.  I love the hard descisions that one must make during the game as well.. "Do I buy stones to keep up in the pyramid race, thereby forgoing buying power cards, and farmers?", "What amount can I safely sacrifice so that I have a good chance to come in first while still keeping the sacrifice in a drought situation?",  All the components work very well together.. really good game!

More complicated (i.e. strategic) than Ra, but still similar in its negative aspects: the scoring system is the game. It's very abstract and not intuitive. The board graphics and tiles make the game situation very unclear.

I understand its appeal, but don't feel like I want to learn its system.

El Grande has a far greater amount of things going on on the board but you can always assess the game situation at a glance. That is the elegance and usability which is missing from Amun Re. Maybe it was ahead of its time?

Un diseño de los mejores de Knizia que, una vez más, está ambientado en una civilización antigua cualquiera. El diseño ofrece cantidad de opciones estratégicas: elegir las provincias que te gustaría quedarte en la subasta, ir a por granjeros (que dan dinero) o ir a por pirámides (que dan PV´s), además de las jugadas "chupi" que dan las cartas. Añade a todo esto la gracia que otorgan los dos tipos de subasta: una con incrementos forzados (1,3,6,10...) y otra "ciega" que permite obtener recursos por poco dinero además de determinar cuánto produce tu provincia. Como se puede ver hay mucho en lo que pensar: cuánto pujar, dónde pujar, que desarrollar... Me gusta la sensación que provoca esta mecánica: la de intuir la respuesta de los demás jugadores en la subasta. No tengo claro si me gusta o no los bandazos que pega el juego (no sabes si jugarlo en plan "optmización" o en plan "intuición") PROS: La segunda parte del juego (cambia totalmente el valor de las provincias al conservarse las pirámides en ellas y desparecer los granjeros). Muchas formas de puntuar "a la Knizia": por pirámides, por granjeros, por mayorías de pirámides, por bonus especiales de las cartas, por oro... Esto ocasiona muchas estrategias. CONS: Es dificil encontrar la estrategia óptima en las primeras partidas. No es un juego para montar y jugar. No jugarlo con menos de 5 jugadores.

[ENG]

One of the best Knizia´s desings that its setting is about an ancient civilization. The design shows a lot of strategic options: choosing the provinces you like during the auction, going for farmers (and increase the money level) o going for pyramids (they give you VP´s), futher, there are a quite pretty cool gambles when you´re using cards. And more, becouse there are two types of auctions: first of them with fixed bids (1,3,6,10...) and the second is a kind of "blind auction" where you can obtain a bunch of goods using little money. As can you see, there is much to think about: how much bid, where to bid, what you need to develop. I do love the "intuition feeling", trying to gess what´s the another player thinking about his/her bid in the auction. I´m not sure if I like the wide variations of the game (I don´t know if I´d play it "optimizely" or "intutively"). PROS: the second part of the game (it changes the provinces´ value becouse the pyramids remain there and farmers don´t). There are a lot of ways to obtain VP´s "ala Knizia": pyramids, farmers, firs majority of pyramids, cards special bonuses, gold... this circumstance generates a lot of strategies. CONS: really difficult to find the optimal strategy during the first games. You should play it only with 5 players.

I really like games with farming themes. I've played Amun-Re game 40  times now and it keeps getting better, and with the player aids I've developed now I can teach this game fairly fast. Fascinated how Knizia is now designing games not so much on mechanics, but how he wants people to interact. Each round is a little script --you've got the besting of the province auction, the intentness of the build, then the tension and anticipation of the closed fist sacrifice, with the cheering and jeering by the players who prevail. Interesting that after Hans im Glück accepted the design they required Reiner to add the Power Cards as added spice.

Typical Euro.  Dry, dry, dry - sometimes I wonder why they even add themes at all to these things.  I wasn't terribly enthralled at any certain point during the game so I guess I'll give my standard response of "everything was well thought out and the mechanics were tight, yet player interaction was lacking and I felt bored the entire time."  Plus, I found not a single weaving hut to crap in which was quite a let-down.

One of Knizia's best designs.  For those who don't like auctions, fear not.  The auctions are quick, very structured and your bidding choices are tough but clearly laid out.  The auctions don't dominate the game.  The artwork and theme add a lot to this great game.

RATING: 10
Amun-Re contains many different elements but they are balanced well enough to form into a relatively convincing whole. The theme is attractive, but of secondary importance to the game mechanics. The scoring is typically (for a Knizia design) many-stranded and leads to some tense bidding in the latter stages of the game. The only element which detracts just a little from the game me is the randomness introduced by the Power Cards.

RATING: 5
It was a great game at first: a bit of territory control, a bit of licitation (original!), multi-dimensional scoring, resource management, different strategies...  All what I like.. (BUT -  see my edit note).

And THIS is the game which hardly (if at all) forgives even 1 (noticable) mistake, even at the very beginning.

Minor complaint comes from the role of temples - they rarely reach higher values and that way decrease usefulness of farmers and provinces containing temples (crippling that way one possible strategy).  It could be fixed by changing ranges on which the value of temples depends.  But on the other hand, maybe it's well thought and done for purpose, otherwise temples&farmers would become too powerful.  Who knows?

EDIT: After 9 plays I really have enough..  The game has SERIOUSLY worn out for me.  I have no fun now, more - I can't stand it any more!  Rank diving down.

Sold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Not an overly deep game by any means here but a strategy title all the same. I do find that the strategies are a little too obvious concerning the provinces although the power cards can impact your decisions. I can see why others have a quibble with the power cards, the game other than this is quite balanced (as usual for a Knizia) so the cards can really be the deciding factor with players of equal skill and it should be a close game unless you failed miserably in the auctions which can happen, especially with 5. Knizia certainly likes a little luck/chance in his games and this is it for this game but these are definitely not the "only" factor in determining the outcome, for example you can exert some control in the auctions to bend things your way, same with the sacrifice, etc. The 2 different auctions are quite good and most of the strategy comes in right here, I like that you only get 'one shot' at a province so you "go big or go home". I was surprised how tight the money was in this game which really adds to the tension. 

This was a fun game that needs more plays with more players, I see people saying it is only really good with 5 people and I think I can see why.... 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Another FTF game but with 5 players, much better than with three but rating sticks. We still didn't see the sacrifice get over the half way mark (into the higher numbers) except once. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Finally seen the sacrifice go up to 4 but it all seems too predictable as the only time it will happen is at the end when money is more in abundance.  5 players seems the only way to go for me. Overall a fun strategy game, just be prepared to have the cards you get dictate your strategic path. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8 => 8.5 This game grows on me just a tiny bit with each play, up to about 10 plays now. Its very enjoyable and would be rated even higher less the luck of the draw which can (but wont always) determine a winner in a close game with all good players, most games are close. Most likely my final rating

The good doctor is back in Egypt with a meaty boardgame that has a lot to like about it. Players play 2 "turns" - the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom. Each turn consists of purchasing via Evo-auction a province, then developing the province with farmers and pyramids. It all costs money, so you have to concentrate on income also. At the end of the first half, ownership is removed, yet the pyramids remain! A bit of down time whenever a player takes power cards, which is exaggerated with more players, however this is clever stuff.

The card draw is a little bit too random, some cards are absolutely useless to you unless you draw them at the right time, and some vp cards that you are aiming to complete you can be locked out of if the provinces come up for auction at the wront time (eg all provinces north of the river come out in the first two rounds, meaning that it is impossible for you to get 3 of them).

Going last in turn order is too powerful when it comes to building pyramids in round 3 and 6, allowing you to know exactly how many to build in order to win majority (being prepared for the 3/2/1 bonusus later on ofc).

The game also lasts way too long (well over an hour), and gets very repetative.

I see absolutely no reason to play this over medici or modern art.

I&#039;ve played this once so far.  The game was not too hard to grasp, although it&#039;s nearly impossible to know how much to bid on provinces.  Repeated playings seem like the best way to learn that.  It played okay with three, but I think 4 or 5 would encourage more aggressive bidding.  The components are excellent, as is the box - everything has a place to fit.  I think this one will see regular play.

I have played the game A LOT and in my opinion the game is, quite simply, marvellous. It blends various clever game mechanics, with the economic game feeling almost completely separate from, yet still integrated with the VP game. At first sight, the luck of the power card draw seems significant (and there is luck involved, to be sure), but with experience I find all the power cards useful, and extremely well balanced in their power. The game offers gutwrenching decisions almost continuously (but especially so in the province auction phase). Many German-style games are very tactical, ie. you can do reasonably well with only short-term planning, but Amun-Re is extremely strategic, so you *have* to think quite far ahead in order to do well. Highly, highly recommended. One of Knizia's best games, if not THE best.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2016)

Nowadays, I expect almost nothing from Mr. Knizia´s games, so when I played Amun-Re I wasn’t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. However this game was designed on 2003 so it seems I do like his earlier/heavier designs. 

The theme is ok and it feels thematic for a Knizia game but, in reality, the theme is rather thin.

The rules are very easy to learn and teach, you can do it under 18 minutes. Amun-Re´s components are great for such an old game and they look gorgeous on the table.

Amun-Re has bidding as its main mechanism and I love bidding games. The decisions are interesting, tense and non-obvious (how much to bid for each card, how many workers/pyramids/cards to purchase, how much to bid for the temples). It also has lots of player interaction. I love how the game resets itself at midpoint, so the players need to re assess their strategy and position (somewhat reminiscent of Brass). You really need to plan ahead if you want to win. 

Best with 5 players.

On the bad side, I feel the luck of the draw with the power cards can be more than I’m comfortable with. I need to play more times to check if this is indeed an issue for me but drawing scoring cards that you already accomplished or that are impossible to accomplish isn’t very fun or fair.

Bottom line, I need to play Amun-Re more times. For now I’m keeping the game and perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me. One of the best Knizia´s games I have played.

RATING: 9
Knizia got this one very, very right.  Tournament play online has renewed my interest in Amun-Re.  While it doesn't appear to have that much replayability, the guessing game of the sacrifice, unpredictability of the province auctions, and the bluff aspect of the pyramid building combine to make this title very replayable indeed.  I'm over 70 plays and still fascinated.

The luck of drawing or not drawing scoring cards can be an issue among players of equal skill.

I've played too many times online to have much fun playing this FTF, unfortunately, unless it's against other SpielByWeb players.  Let that be a lesson to me to avoid "playing out" too many other games online.

I've only played this once but my intial view on it was that it was just so-so.  I didn't really see the agonizing decsions that others claim make the game so great.  It just seemed like there weren't many choices along the way and while there were some big decsions to make I felt that they weren't agonizing because the right choice was rather obvious.  But in all fairness I should play this game a few more times before I completely write it off.  

**Decided to just trade it away.  With all the other great games out there it's hard for me to get a game to the table again that doesn't wow me or at least intrigue me the first gaming experience.

After two plays:

So far I find myself thoroughly enjoying this game. I really like the auction aspect of the game. I think it's handled very nicely. The auction is certainly better the more players there are but most are. 

There are many, many ways to score points thus many strategies that can be used. I like having that variety. 

It actually moves fairly quickly with what felt like little downtime. 

It's quite easy to learn and teach. I find it to be very enjoyable. The more the merrier with this one.

Pretty solid Reiner game featuring some nice mechanisms and interesting choices to make. Two aspects of the game prevent me from giving it a higher rating. First is the lack of alternative strategies to pyramid building, which generates far and away the most victory points during the game. Second is the imbalance in the strength of the bonus cards, with some being valuable whenever they are drawn, some having their value depend largely on when they are drawn, and at least one being weak in most instances. Still, not a bad offering and one I enjoy playing.

I had wanted to try this for so very long because it just looks so great. It's a pretty straightforward game with a set number of game turns, each consisting of a few phases. The auctions use preset increments instead of open-ended bidding. Pay attention up front to how you score--I undervalued sets of pyramids in particular. In the game we played, small sacrifices kept the harvest very small (it never exceeded 2), so players loading up on farmers got screwed. 

In the stable of Knizia games where you can score in umpteen different ways, I much prefer and will be sticking with [gameid=475].

RATING: 8
Amun-Re is a nice collection of good ideas. There are 15 provinces on the board. Each turn a player wins a province at auction, then players buy power cards (which give bonuses in certain game phases), farmers (which provide income) and bricks to build pyramids (which give points). Players then bid money as a sacrifice to the god Amun-Re. The total value of the sacrifice from all players combined primarily indicates how much income the farmers produce on that turn. Players can drive the total down by stealing from Amun-Re (if they don't have a lot of farmers, say), but those players miss out on the gifts bestowed to those who have sacrificed the most. Then income is determined. This happens 3 times until every province has been purchased. The first three turns are called the "Old Kingdom" - after which pyramids, temples, and power cards are scored - then the board is cleared of everything except pyramids and it starts again with the "New Kingdom".

Knizia built his reputation mostly on his innovative auction mechanics and Amun-Re is right there with the best. Amun-Re has two kinds of auctions: a set value auction for provinces which works great, and a collective blind-bid auction for sacrificing to Amun-Re, where the bids are all totaled together for a combined value that applies to all players equally. Some players are interested in keeping the sacrifice low, so landing a high sacrifice forces some players to throw in a lot of money. The game is not difficult by any means, but there are enough decision points to keep players engaged. I'm torn between scoring it a low 9 or a high 8. Like most Knizia games, there is enough randomness in the power cards to keep this solidly in the medium-weight range. I don't mind the randomness of the power cards, but the deck does get cycled through a few times and get less interesting as the options get more limited each time through. It's a bit messy, which keeps me from putting this with Knizia's top two games - Ra and T&E - but Amun-Re is a thoroughly enjoyable game.

Knizia's last gamer's game? Initially I thought it was merely OK but it has grown on me and now I really like it. It can suffer a bit when played with people new to it though, as they can tend to throw the game by bidding/sacrificing 'incorrectly', but with experienced players it's brilliant. A shame that it was removed from Spielbyweb as the online implementation was really good.

I have a bit of a love hate relationship with Reiner Knizia, never quite sure if I will like his games or not. This one I do like (Obvious from the rating). People always talk about his very light themes, but this one seems to stick to theme a bit better than most.

OK, the auction for each space does not make a lot of thematic sense, but building pyramids and temples, offerings to the gods, farming by the Nile etc, means there is plenty that does make sense.

Amun-Re is a bog-standard AA (Auction+Actions) game with absolutely zero theme.  Its completely abstract and any relationship to anything Egyptian is purely coincidental.  I found it insipid.  Sure, there is 'turn angst', 'multiple paths to victory' and 'agonising decisions', but who cares?  Thanks to Terry for allowing me to try this (at my request) but I won't be suggesting it again.

In Amun-re, players preside over two generations of development in different regions of ancient Egypt. Provinces are auctioned off, and from there, it's a matter of turning arable land to advantage (building income) and building pyramids. You are rewarded for complete sets of pyramids, having the most pyramids on one side of the Nile, settling only on one side of the Nile, or settling all in the north or all in the south. That's all well and good, but the bit of genius tucked away in Amun-re is that each player can affect the income of his or her opponents. The turn ends with a "sacrifice" in which all players simultaneously reveal any amount of tribute. If they pay in enough as a group, harvests are good (high income). If they are stingy or even steal from the tribute (yes, you can steal from the tribute), harvests are poor. This works because not all provinces are equally productive, so some players have a higher potential income but a higher incentive to worship Amun-re as well. Very cool.

Update: A second play convinces me that the 8 rating for this game is on solid ground. Undoubtedly a classic. The last great game for Knizia; he's had a seven year drought following it. I'm not sure there's anything in the game that will raise it to a 9 for me, but I'd be happy to play it just about any time. Requires a lot of skill. A very intense game; make a few mistakes and you will creep along in last place. 

2nd Update: We don't get Amun-Re to the table that often, but this is an extremely resilient 5-player game. Very tough push-pull going on from start to finish. Perhaps the strongest point here is that someone who is slightly behind can "play their ass off" and make up a little ground here and a little there... very satisfying.

Amun-Re is the last of the great Knizia strategy classics and invented simultaneous auctions as most remarkable feature. It's typically Knizia with its multiple scoring dimensions and perfect balance. A slight luck factor is present in the bonus card draws but experienced players will usually win this as they will know how much to bid on what and this is where the game is decided. Many claim that they only will play this with 5 but I enjoyed it with 4 as well. A classic that stood the test of time.

This is the game that I'm starting to see everyone list as "most underrated." If so many people say so, then how can it possibly be underrated? Regardless, this is a great game with auctions, money management, land development, and theme theme theme. I love how the game resets at the midpoint and the values of the provinces in the auctions shift. I think there is a layer of complexity that involves reading your opponents' motives and making them pay more in auctions to get the provinces they really want, but I haven't reached that level of skill yet.

RATING: 7
It took till now to play this, but I'm glad I finally did. It's an impressive exercise, and I mean "exercise" as a compliment here. The regions seem nicely balanced, as do the approaches to winning. I think I especially like how the midgame scoring has basically no relation to the endgame scoring: most everything gets "reset," although the pyramids remain. Not sure how thematic that is, but it certainly makes for an interesting task. Nice components and a good play time.

I can see how other comments I have read are truthful.  The Power Cards can indeed swing things at the end of the game, and the game does feel a little bit like a mish mash of various mechanisms.

A fairly quick resource management game. The major part of the game is just deciding how much of three resources (cards, farmers or stones) you want to buy. After that the game pretty much plays itself. Its interesting, but I really wish the cards had text. Its very annoying to constantly have to refer to the rulebook.

Knizia's auction system is great and the game as a process is good. A brilliant auctioning system is, however, overshadowed by perfectly unbalanced cards. You can win through skilled playing, but most probably you'll need a couple of bonus scoring cards even then. What bothers me a lot more is that you can play brilliantly, but still lose the game because of unfortunate draws. I don't know many other games where I'd noticed this could be possible. So, a 90-minute game is actually reduced into a 1-minute luckfest in the end where drawing the right power cards is the deciding factor. I've once ended second in a 5-player game where the winner won by 12 points. We'd have had equal amount of points without his bonus scoring cards while I drew a total of 15 cards during the game without getting any bonus scoring card. Also, the farmers always suck which makes it a little boring. Just go for the camels if you're willing to win.  Stupid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love games where you get your income, and then have to divide it up between everything you need/want to do that turn. Amun-Re does that, and does it great. Power cards to keep things interesting; cool twist on auctions; multiple ways to get income and score points. I love the mid-game switch, and I love the offerings, which are two weird, but interesting things that make the game different from everything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Balance of activities that are different from any other game I'm familiar with.  Each small thing is familiar; bidding for territory, building on territory, buying improvements with limited cash.   Lots of things going on, but they blend together really well.The mid-game flood and re-start is cool.Played in VA with a couple of hep cats.Would definitely play again.

A game involving auctioning off of provinces, then earning points for various activities including developing of those provinces with pyramids. It is a fun game with an interesting twist that comes in the second half. For the second half of the game, a new age begins and all of the provinces are re-auctioned before continuing play. This means that players may benefit in the second half of the game from improvements made by another player in the first half. It’s interesting and challenging to balance earning points in the first age vs. the potential benefit an opponent may get for those improvements in the second age (and vs. saving up money to ensure you can buy key provinces for the second age).

Excellent strategic auction and action game. Very nice components! The random selection of the provinces to be auctioned in each round ensures replayability. The drawing of the power cards might appear to introduce a high degree of luck, but each card has its value and appropriate use during the course of the game. Your strategy should be based on which cards you have or might get in the future (take in account the conditions to be fulfilled for the 3P bonus power cards). Try to control the province with the highest number of piramides on one of the sides of the Nile. Also the temple provinces combined with a high sacrifice can be quite rewarding. And of course, ... to be able to do all that you have to earn money via farmers or camels.

This game can be deceiving: what at first seems mostly tactical conceals some fairly deep strategies.

01-07-2015 - Played some time ago now with Aron and Bethany.  I liked it.  It's not too long and has pretty good mechanics.  The power cards or whatever are a little random and can be hard to make work for you (you really just have to just hope sometimes it'll work out with nothing you can do), but other than that it's s pretty solid game.

Amun-Re is a game I've played more online (at SpielByWeb) than I have in real life, though that's something like 4 plays, now!   It is one of only two games to have that distinction (Samurai is the other).  A large part of it is that the components are so pretty that they stand out even in an online representation.  A fun auction game that I haven't really wrapped my head around...yet.

The more I play this game the more I like it. Its really good. Clever bidding, different ways to score. One always has to choose between Stones, farmers and power cards. Doesn't ever seem like you can get all three. Kind of like "pick two: Health, Wealth, or Wisdom."

The fixed number of rounds helps make the game a very fun but also concise experience.  There is a good deal of player interaction in spite of the individual resource development.  The game also improves with the skill of the players, especially their ability to evaluate the provinces available.

Missing provinces can randomly affect power card goals when playing with fewer than five players.  To help counteract this, you can choose and reveal the missing provinces at the start of the game, but a full complement of five is still the best situation.

Played couple of times. I like the mechanism, which "start the game again" in the middle of it. Also the bidding-system feels good, but all the rest is somehow dull: there should be "something going on" on the board and more interaction between players. 

Now all you have to do is be ready on when it's time to bid: focus on some specific strategy and play three rounds to get that goal (all depends on your power cards which might give you up to +9VP:s). Also be sure that you'll get bonus points for the pyramids... and that's it.

New Release in March 2017

Each player wants, as pharaoh, to build the most pyramids. To accomplish this, he must first acquire a province, where he can trade and farm. With his profits, he can buy new provinces and building stones to erect pyramids. For all his actions, the player must make clever use of his power cards, and always offer appropriate sacrifices to Amun Re. Players must always keep their eyes on the goal of the building of the eternal pyramids or risk falling behind in points.

One of the more complex great Euros of its time (2000-2004, see Puerto Rico, Goa, Princes of Florence etc.) with a truly Knizian way of balanced gameplay even with a large randomizer factor of the several different card types. And the way of auction is pure genius; the sacrifice part is also great.

RATING: 9
[2008.Feb.19] A solid Egyptian-themed Euro by Reiner Knizia; one of his (pleasantly) heavier board games. The auction and bluffing aspects make the game shine, game-after-game. Buy power cards, farmers, and pyramid stones, and then pray it goes your way during the sacrifice. I hope you were able to placate Amun-Re. Finally, just when you get the hang of it all, it's time for the 2nd half—à la the New Kingdom. Good luck bidding on your provinces!

RATING: 7
I think this game is over-hyped.  I'm usually a fan of Knizia games but this one falls short for me.  As an auction game with a good deal of bidding, winning at it really comes down to the deck of power cards and who manages to draw luckiest, that is, whoever draws cards "MOST appropriate" to their circumstances will win every time.  I've played it many times and winning or losing "always" comes down to the lucky card draws.  But, this is a BOARD game isn't it?  The mechanisms are great though.  Evaluating what to bid on each territory is very interesting and I like the auctions.  The most consistent way to play seems to be to build as many blocks while buying farmers & cards and hope to get luckier than the next person.  The game does indeed have a great production quality and a really nice presentation, but I just can not "overlook" the fact that this game is really disguised as a "Draw The Right endgame Power Cards".  There is not other randomn/luck factor in the game so it essentially all hinges upon that one stack of cards and what other players discard.  I'd rather play a card game or something in half the time, or if I like these types of auctions then I'd suggest Vegas Showdown to be played.

RATING: 6
This game really is much more than an auction game although it centers around auctioning regions within ancient Egypt.  Each region will often provide different setups that will either aid in earning money for future purchases, building blocks for pyramids, farmers, etc as well as temples for scoring.  There is quite a few little details to keep an eye on to make sure one person doesn't get a monopoly on temple regions, etc.  Sacrifices to Amun-Re also give opportunity to determin income per farmer as well as grant opportunity to gain extra actions.  It definitely takes one play just to see the basic interworkings of the game.

I've generally cooled on Knizia's "classic" games. I can appreciate the design of them (such as the different epochs, partly wiping the board clean, here) but such a thing doesn't really do much for me anymore without more going on. There's nothing especially wrong here, but it's a game you pull off the shelf (maybe), play, and then put back, and how fun is that?

I showed up in the middle of a game of Amun-Re in progress. The game looked interesting, which is saying a lot since I do not lean towards auction games. To play well, it appears that you have to know all the ways to score (which are not that many, but took me a some time to understand) and how to use the action cards well.

If I have any criticisms from not playing, it is that the board is very cluttered. It was not easy for me to see "who had what". I would guess playing reduces this complexity as you mostly focus on the areas you control.

It seems a little bit fragile to me in the sense that if the other players aren't paying sufficient attention and working together to do something about it, one player can run away with the game (hint: don't let one player get all of the province with the most pyramids bonuses).

Good auction/building game. Unfortunately have only ever played it with 3 players and the auction can be a little uninetresting like this.  Need to get this to the table with 4 or 5.

The buying mechanic is clever, but can mean that people tend to spend about the same each time - although I guess the subtlety is knowing when and where to spend extra (or not).

Amun-Re is a strange, Lewis Carrol twist on the standard systems game (ie. Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, Caylus and the like). You have to invest in territory and infrastructure (farmers and pyramids) in order to establish income and scoring, only to have it blown up half way through the game *and* leave the pyramids for someone else to use later. No other game dares to have this kooky an income mechanism, and it works beautifully. The sacrifice is a weird informed-groupthink exercise, and the auction system is old hat now (see Vegas Showdown and Homesteaders), but in 2003 it was a platypus.

Somehow, the good Dr. Knizia has managed to avoid making Amun-Re feel like a jangly mess of mechanics, though. Where games like Caylus and Power Grid feel like a tangled mess, Amun-Re powerss along like a British roadster. I can't point to the difference with any confidence, but it is a question I will continue to study.

I will concede that the Power Cards can inject an awkward level of luck sometimes. While bad draws are not that big a deal, since you can cycle cards if you want to, it sucks when your opponent gets a magical run of useful cards. This is a small blemish, though, and one that I am willing to tolerate on occasion in order to enjoy the rest of this gaming symphony.

While I can't quite rank Amun-Re as highly as I do Race for the Galaxy or Princes of Florence, it is still an excellent heavy euro, and one I will happily play at any time.

Rating after only one game and maybe it wasn't the right crowd for this game. This a dry, mathematical game. You count a LOT of things. In fact, you almost always do math. I really like that... but my fellow gamers not so much. 

This is not an easy game to explain at first. Each phases has its quirk and the scoring is extremely varied. But after an example round everyone should be able to understand.

I really like the economic of the game. You have to get your "cash-engine" rolling or else you won't be able to do nothing. I like that each resources of the game is equally important: Farmer for cash, Block for VP and cards for some wildness. Each province are not created equal and on the first game it is not easy to see which province are best. I guess it comes with experience.

This game is great for 3 and only gets better with more.

Update:

Years later and this still gets played at least a few times a year. The bidding system that we now see in Vegas Showdown, Homesteaders, and even Peloponnes started here; but in a harsher twist in the "cannot bid in the same location once outbid".

The more the merrier but I've never been totally convinced that you have to play with max players for this to be a good game.

This is about my favorite game that I don't own (due to not being 2 player), I love the push and pull of the auctions and the offerings to Amun-Re, as everyone tries to get their little bit of Egypt as good as it can be whilst keeping everyone else down as far as possible.  Occasionally the luck of the special cards can affect the outcome too much and sometimes the group think pushes the farms to become too valuable (the desert folks should not allow that to happen), but part of the appeal is that you are not quite sure how it will all work out.

This game is quick easy to learn and yet fun with a capital F. The way the kingdoms are represented and the 2 ages link up with the scoring mechanisms makes it very interesting as there arelots of ways to shoot up the score track. The money earning in this game and the fact that one must start almost from scratch at the start of the 2nd ages means players must balance setting up thier economies with actually scoring points. Very good game!! I love it like Oedipus loved his mum, until he found out about the whole mum thing......

FARMING in the desert??!?!?

I think there may be a good game in Amun-Re.  I enjoy the auction and deciding which way to go on the sacrifice.  Choosing the balance between income, spending, and points is at the heart of the strategic decisions, and it seems you really need a good bonus card or two and to work to those cards to get much needed bonus points.

Its a fun, fairly light-to-medium-weight game that can be played in an hour or so.

I played Homesteaders before and both games use the same auction mechanism. The rating is based on a single play, all played Homesteaders before and I'm the only one who has not played Amun Re.
For a 3 player game, the conflict is just too few and most decisions doesn't matter much except the 3rd and 6th (scoring) turn. The luck from the cards make the game more variable and replayable, but also more random. Maybe the game would get better with more players.

Based on two plays. Power cards seem quite swingy - the particular card that I felt lost me the game first time out, won it for me on the second game when I succeeded in drawing a significant number of them, so feel justified in saying there is a bit of a balance issue there. Quite like it in all other respects.

I thought RA was going to be my favorite Egyptian themed game.  Boy, was I wrong!  This is a much deeper game, requiring serious planning and plotting in order to win.  While it will probably never be a gaming group favorite, it's certainly in the top 10.  It also has the distinction of being the only game I ever bought based on reading a Session Report.

RATING: 5
A bit slow for my taste.  The various concepts are interesting, but don't make a compelling, cohesive whole for me.  Not horrible, but not great.

The randomness from provinces and power cards can spoil this a for me.  I also find it generally too easy to make the decisions necessary. Only in the province bidding am I really taxed, and that's usually just a contest to make sure everyone pays enough for the things they decide to buy.

5 plays, 4 and 5 players.

I really enjoy how the pyramids are the only thing that survives from the Old Kingdom to the New, and gives the regions added meaning during the second half of the game. But the rest of it has that Knizia quality I leas admire, a bunch of abstract knobs with which to manipulate the game, especially scoring.

This game has gotten much better with age as I have began to understand the strategies more.  I think that my problem when I was first playing is that I was spending too much money buying cards.

There doesn't seem to be much strategic or thematic variation during the game, which makes it slightly too long for what it has to offer. Also, the player interaction is a little low and the power cards are a little too random. Still not too shabby, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Subtle, with lots of depth in the auction phases.  "Too much randomness in the power cards," some say, but I don't mind that.  Unfortunately, this game does depend on having five players, preferably all who have played the game before.  If you've got that, it's a great game, I say.

2 / 5 - Fair.

A very odd beast. It's full of opposites - objective analysis versus subjective valution, ruthless min/maxing which can be scuppered by random card draws. I can't quite make up my mind whether these drive the game or ruin it. For an elegant Euro it's got an impressive amount of thematic integration.

I love auction games.  In most auction games you bid for tiles or cards that give you special powers.  In Amun Re you bid for territory along the Nile.  This territory comes with special powers.  As with all auction games there is a learning curve (which territory is better, how much should I bid).  Amum Re has lots of player interaction (the auction, the cards, the sacrafice).

This game is one that really does deserve 10 out of 10. We all totally LOVE this game, played every day for 2 months since I bought it. I even went to the trouble of making my own Summary Cards (the original ones that came with the box weren't that good, we needed power card explanations, and a few important points that weren't on the original summary cards. I actually managed to put all info required to play the game on these full page (1/2 page folded) summary cards.) I'll upload the summary card .pdf if anyone wants it.

RATING: 8
An incredibly fun game with simple rules but deep and complex play. Two things keep this from being a 10. No effort was made at all to scale the game making it playable with only five. Also, all players need to be of roughly equal skill at auction style games as this particular auction mechanism is highly susceptible to poor play. 

Other than that, Amun-Re is a masterpiece. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
After several playings I am still far from developing a strategy for Amun-Re, and I mean that in a good way. There seems to be a lot of different but valid ways to approach the game. The many decisions throughout the game are both crucial and subtle. I look forward to playing many more times, highly recommended.

***UPDATE***

What the hell, this is a 10. The strategy does reveal itself after more plays. Basically this is economic infrastructure game where you're trying to convert money to investments to points.

One legendary game from legendaary Knizia. Heard lot of this and finally I got change to play this. I like lot ancient egypt theme. First player market and temple marker are superb. Pyramids looks nice. Board and cards are just ok. The game itself is auction for different land places and you can later build these land places farmers and pyramids. Middle of game everything expect pyramids reset to zero after scoring. This is clever mechanic. And in the end of the game is secodn scoring.

Game wasn't so good that I expect. Mid-game reseting was good and some other mechanics was also good. But maybe game needs some more playing to show it's goodnes. Now it's feel so typical euro.

Amun Re is something of a mixed bag for me.  I appreciate the auction mechanic and the cards which throw some random elements into the game.

I wish this part of the game had a little more polish.  Still, it has been enjoyable each time I have played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting and quite cut-throat bidding game with an element of luck. Sometimes the cards work for you, sometimes against.

One thing Knizia seems to do well is balance open information with randomness. I have some issues with the components - the bricks and bidding lozenges are a bit odd and the Pharaoh token is hopeless, plus the cartoonish graphics don't seem to fit the seriousness of the theme. Maybe Menzel should've done this one rather than Vohlwinkel? - but, otherwise, this is a great game that does a good job of hiding the winner right until the last moment.

If it weren't for the component issues, plus the fact that a few of my group already own it, I'd definitely buy this.

RATING: 6
Interesting bidding game. The number of turn makes it a closer game, but forces you to think short term. Nice play mechanics, nice mix of bidding game and strategic ressource building. But only 6 turns, although game time is good, having so little time forces you to act quickly. Holding your card and money is not necessarily a good strategies for more than one turn, but I still enjoyed the game.

I have since played Vegas Showdown which is similar in some respects.

If you like a bidding game you'll like this game.  You bid for different provinces in Ancient Egypt.  Some provinces are good for farming and others are good for building pyramids.  At a certain point of the game everything will be removed (except pyramids) and players will once again bid for provinces.  After bidding for provinces players will use their money to buy famers and construct pyramids.  The amount of money you will make will depend on how many farmers you have and how much money was sacrificed to Amun Re.

RATING: 8
Amun-Re is a good game whose most important feature seems to be the blind auction that determines harvests and allows players to win additional resources. In Amun-Re, it's a little too easy to fall way behind because of one mistake (getting cash-strapped, choosing the wrong province) but this is because the duration of the game is a short 6 rounds. This is definitely a game where the time-value of resources plays a prominent role. 

I don't find the luck element introduced by the Power Cards to be a flaw; few games with cards *don't* have that kind of randomness. However, the role played by table position, in tie-breaking and bidding, can be annoying.

Also: Before you play, make sure all players agree (either way) on whether or not Bidding Blockade may be played out-of-turn. The rulebook isn't clear on the matter. The game plays better if this is allowed, but a lot of players say it must be played pre-emptively, making the card very weak.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Auction for available properties that have their own unique bonuses, then compete to improve your lands better then your opponents. Improve in different ways and score points in different ways.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: The separation between old age then starting all over in the new age was interesting, as was the auctioning for areas at the beginning of each round.
 
Cons: Outside of those two pieces of mere interest, nothing else felt exciting or original. Just an average pick how you want to score your points, specialize, and crunch numbers like it's nobodies business. Probably the ugliest game I've played in that visually, the layout doesn't make the game very intuitive.

Other: Ok, ok. This is all initial impression after a single play. I'm sure I'll be giving it another try especially after I've read the rules, (which hopefully will help me better visualize the game).

Best Use: Need a brain-burn for 4 or 5 people.

After one play, would have to rate Amun-Re significantly below games of similar weight such as Traders of Genoa. I like the small role of chance. But the distinctiveness of this game comes from the bidding, and the bidding just isn't exciting if nobody knows what makes one province more valuable than another. Lots of zero bids this time around. Will have to read Alex's articles.

Sacrifice to Amun-Re which determines income your farmers produce for you.  Build temples for victory points and score bonus points for meeting certain criteria if you hold a power card.

At its heart, Amun-Re is yet another resource conversion game: you're taking gold and turning it into farmers, provinces, bricks, and cards, which combine with each other into more gold, more of each other, and--ultimately--points. No matter how challenging these games might be, I typically don't find them all that intriguing, but Amun-Re has been an exception. Its nuances have been surprisingly counter-intuitive for me, and I seem to love games with a dramatic "board sweep" at the half (e.g., Brass). Amun-Re probably benefits from a dedicated group of five, and I bet it was excellent online.

However, there are some downsides. First, it takes quite a bit a little longer to explain than I'd prefer. (I pulled off a quick explanation once by skimping on the Power Cards, just pointing to the last page of the rules to use as a reference. Big mistake.) For the uninitiated, turns can seem a bit repetitive, making the game feel long. You'll want exactly five players, which can be a tough number to hit regularly. Finally, despite Amun-Re's advantages over your typical spreadsheet game, there's only so far I can go with this type of game.

Hopefully, Amun-Re will get some traction with a regular group of players. It could go far under the right conditions, but if it's just coming out with new players every time, it'll probably hit the trade pile within the year, especially since others in my gaming circle own it.

RATING: 5
I wish the buying of resources wasn't as confusing - since each set of items has it's own cost, but you usually buy some of each at a time other people's counting always seems wonky.

It also feels like the game is longer than it needs to be - the second round of auctions is very exciting since people have more goals in mind and there are various states of pyramids already present though.

Another solid Knizia auction game.  The auction mechanic is unique but so far has not led to the bidding wars of other games in which all players are bidding on one item or lot.  I find the other phases of the game, purchasing cards, farms, stones, and offering sacrifices with limited resources more interesting than the auctions.  Good resource management and knowing when to build pyramids in mass seems to be the key to victory.

I really like this second Egyptian confection from Knizia, though I've only played twice.  Unlike most Euros where resources are tight, you're simply being given things throughout the game.

Good blend of blind bidding, auctioning and developing a simple economic engine. The most fun mechanism is the sacrifice and watching the tension emerge between farmers/temples and trader/pyramid builders. Balancing points earned between the old and new kingdoms is interesting, too. I'd rate Amun Re higher if the game wasn't so sensitive to the draw of the power cards, although I do like the idea of secret missions driven by the bonus scoring cards.

A bit disappointing. I really like the style of auction presented here, but just like Cyclades, the rest of the game built around it is pretty mediocre. I was really hoping this would replace Vegas Showdown in my mind, but in actuality it almost feels like Knizia's imitation of that system. Every region has its own rules and restrictions, and the only real room for creative play is through the cards, which range from being incredibly useful to being downright pointless. I thought the game was fine, but nothing I felt was worth playing again. 

I would rather play Ra if given the choice.

Amun-Re is a game with many faces. Is it an auction game, where your skills in valuating land and outbidding opponents gives you the edge? Or is it a building game, where your skills in managing your economy and improving your assets tip the balance in your favour? Or is it a conflict game, where you choose actions that benefit you and hurt the others? Well, Amun-Re is all this!

As a dynasty leader in the Old Kingdom of Egypt, you start by bidding for provinces. Do you want to build wealth through farming or trading? Do you want to acquire "safe" victory points by building pyramids or try your luck by buying unknown power cards? The choice is yours but beware, your success depends on all players' actions!

It is namely the god Amun-Re that brings fortune (good farming) or misfortune (good trading) to Egypt and his mood depends on the total amount that the dynasties sacrify to (or steal from) him. Your grand plans for your provinces will come to nothing if you don't take into account your competitors' plans.

So what happens if your land does prosper? Alas, the Old Kingdom falls apart and the New Kingdom rises. Everything your forefathers have built is doomed to vanish with one exception - the mighty pyramids. However, your tenderly nurtured provinces may now be acquired by someone else and it is not until the end of the New Kingdom that the worthy Pharaoh may claim the victory.

Upgrading to highest rating after playing repeatedly on Spielbyweb.com.  This game rocks.  One of Dr. Knizia's best games.  So mathmatically painful in the choices he gives you thru auctions for regions, building, farming and then making a sacrifice to the gods.  Right up there with the best of them.  Excellent interplay between players and I love the theme...very aesthetically pleasing and not that hard to teach really for a designer game..bidding is made simple by a bidding track and card management of power cards is important and challenging.

I have fallen in love with this game.  The great blend of strategy and tactics makes for a deep, interesting game each time.  There is so much to learn and know about Amum-Re that I keep coming back to it for more.  I especially like how the values of all the provinces change as the game progresses and depending upon how they come up for auction together.

I know some people complain about the power cards, but since you draw so many of them over the course of the game, it really seems to even out.  That is, assuming you remove the overbid on a province card, as this one is useless.  I will play this one with either 3, 4, or 5, as I enjoy the game in all its forms, but it is best with 5.  I came to this one late, but I'm so glad that I picked it up.

RATING: 7.5
Overall comment: an auction type game that requires the player to manage their money in different ways from spending to giving it away.  The bidding is unique in gaming and where you are in the turn order is crucial to winning especially with 3 players.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor):7 (expected a more interesting looking game and the pieces(ie. amun-re for example) seemed kind of cheap)
Family: 7 (sometimes requested)
Game group: 8 (all in the group will play but the game has has a sameness to it the last few times)
AP rating: 5 (some delays in the play)
Solo play: not yet developed

When purchased: 2007
Recommend expansions: none available
Age range: 10+
Luck factor: 2
Play time: 2 hours

Reason purchased: Geek analysis

Pros: offers a different take on the auctioning mechanic and puts the player in complete control of the outcome, the offering is a tricky action that ultimately sets up the next round
Cons: not much variety in the gameplay and the second epic can often be won by focusing on a single province which, when this is won by the player, often makes it difficult for others to overcome it.  This is as long as it wasn't overpayed for.

Recommendation: a good medium weight game that offers some strategic decisions, mostly with regards to cash flow, but does not overtax the mind in the process.  No big numbers here. It is a good game played in moderation.
Replay rating: slightly below average
Game value (plays/cost): Marginal (requests for play have fallen off recently due to the nature of the last 3 games played which seemed to be scripted)

RATING: 6.5
Highly anticipated release from Knizia in 2003. Players bid on provinces, buying power cards, placing farmers and build temples in ancient Egypt. Each round a sacrifice in money is made to Amun Re to determine how much further actions you get. It's a bit long, since if you make a mistake early, you will be out of the whole game. Some luck on the draw of the power cards (some give VPs, some give farmers, some give bonuses, etc). I would play it, but I prefer Knizia's other designs such as Taj Mahal or Euphrates and Tigres. This game also plays best with five players.

RATING: 7
Lots of little things going on instead of one central mechanism.  The rulebook is a little imposing for that reason, but Amun-Re is actually very easy to comprehend and proceeds at a good clip.  Its biggest problem is the ease with which you can draw totally useless action cards while somebody else draws precisely what they need to earn those few extra points that give them the game.

I've won games where I never scored a single point using bonus cards, and I've lost games where I scored several cards in a game.

Long before 'Legacy' games were a thing, Reiner Knizia created Amun-Re; essentially a short, bland auction game, followed by another short, bland auction game where players are now bidding on the partially developed holdings from the first game. A two-part Egyptian-themed Legacy game, if you will.

I'm not really a fan of auction games, nor am I a fan of any kind of serialized game, be it an RPG or a Legacy title, so the innovation of Amun-Re didn't excite me at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really fun auctioning game.  I liked how the auctioning numbers were written on the cards and had a high number that could not go higher.  Along the nile you may be trying to get all your locations on the east, or west, or the biggest pyramids, but to own one you need to win the auction.  After winning two auctions you can build on that spot and use it's abilities.  Half way through the game you will score points, than re-auction every spot, possibly giving all your hard work to someone else, which is fine because you may want to take advantage of another spot anyway for the latter half of the game.

Not sure if all I wrote makes sense, but the game is a good auctioning game with secret objectives and lots of room to change and alter your strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best part of this game is the bidding mechanic. If you get out bid you cannot just up the bid on the same region. You have to choose a different region. I really like that. It forces you to bid high for something want.

Probably a great game in its time, but because of this, may have inspired newer games such as Amyitis and Tzolk'in, which play similarly to Amun-Re but for the randomization factor of the power cards. Thereby making Amyitis and Tzolk'in improved versions of this classic.

I don't know what it is, but this just doesn't tie together well. It seems like you have to do a bunch of unrelated, random stuff, and the power cards make it even more chaotic. As much as I love Knizia, this game doesn't work for me as well as some of his others.

Good combination of hand/resource management and auctions. It seems very important to grab as many cards as early as you can. That way, you'll have a greater chance of picking up bonus point cards. It might be good to bid high during the 'appease amun-re' phase just to get three extra cards.

RATING: 8
I like the idea of having two rounds where you build stuff on first one but you cannot know if this benefits you as anyone can then bid for it on the second time it comes to auction. There aren't too many ways to score points and the points seem to be very tight no matter what (if at all sensible) you do because of this.

Another one of Knizia's best. The theme fits well with the gameplay, and the many interlocking mechanisms seem to interlace with the theme. That these mechanisms are broken into their own sections makes the game feel much simpler than it really is. Amun-Re is part auction, part building, (part deduction, for advanced player), part brinksmanship. Mainly, though, it is a wonderfully brain-burning money management game. Well worth playing again and again.The game's replay value comes from the fact that the mechanisms affect each player in slightly different ways, based on the provinces one holds and the cards in hand. After around 40  plays I still do not enough of a handle on all of them to consistantly win.An excellent game in my book, and its heart is much lighter than a feather.

The auction mechanism is ingenious but there's a lot more to the game than that. It's basically about resource optimization. You have to carefully balance your bidding, farming, and building actions to pursue the various public and hidden goals. Nice bits and one of the best looking box covers I've seen.

This is an interesting collection of mechanisms, but I think the heart of the game is two auctions - the novel way of bidding for provinces and the blind bidding for the sacrifice with different goals.

The game uses a bidding system like Evo/Cyclades/Homesteaders, where you place a bid with a marker and if you are outbid then you have to bid again. Nice majority based auction game, with several scoring methods woven together, though some of the things you get points for felt rather arbitrary/disconnected with the theme.

Reiner takes on another Egyptian themed auction game! Ra is really just a trick-taking game with some interesting ClipArt. Maybe Amun-Re is really the game he meant to make with Ra. Or maybe Knizia just really likes the time period. In any case, this is Ra 2.0, as if the designer just added one more hour of gameplay for lulz. While Ra is light and fun when it comes to an auction game, Amun-Re presents a beautiful map which deepens strategies and makes the game thematic and rich. Now, we're pharaohs who buy provinces, pyramids and prestige, competing to own the most profitable and prominent lands. Also added to your pain is the sacrifice to Ra every round to determine how much money your provinces stand to make. But not every province is made equal: some provinces need the sacrifice to Ra to be just a little less which makes them money and no one else. There are also endgame bonuses which you can earn, based off your province's positions on the map. All this can sound complicated and compared to Ra, it is. But I had so much fun playing this one! I loved the auction mechanic which let me see who was positioned where, I loved the action cards which "broke" the game in interesting little ways, I even loved that the game was divided into two "ages" where the same provinces you spent the game building up and improving might not come back in the second half! It's a great game and am so glad I own a copy!

Pulls together lots of elements well - blind bidding, worker placement, auction, etc - so that the whole makes for an enjoyable game. Frequent comments that it's under-rated I think come from the fact that most people like most of these elements, but few people like all of them, so there's always a bit that causes people reservations. Still, it makes it somewhat attractive to a lot of people. Playing with less than 5 gives a different game, and it's arguable that playing with 3 is best. It diminishes the auction, but puts a much higher importance on the valuation element.

Just played this again for the first time in a few years. It is still worth my rating. 

I realized that the cards are very important and since what you get is quite random you need to get a lot of cards to win, especially at the beginning of each age, before the deck is reshuffled, because then everyone is keeping all the scoring cards. Without plenty of scored scoring cards it's difficult to win.

I've really enjoyed this game, but I was mildly disappointed that in the end the victory can be due to the choices of other players.  I lost a game by a point due to a player boosting the Ra sacrifice on the final turn.  Regardless of what he did his own position was fixed, but the winner was set by this choice.

Considerably more complicated than Ra, a favorite, but I think there is place for both. Really like the auction system here, which Vegas Showdown later uses.  

I could see minmaxing becoming a problem for AP players, I am hoping it does not.

Initially bought probably 2007, then sold/traded it after playing someone else's copy, who was shite about teaching the game. Reading more about the game later and many geekbuddies comments made me reacquire in a trade 5/14.

RATING: 9
Amun-Re is one of Knizia's masterpieces. It is a beautiful and deeply strategic game with a consistently realized theme.  

The phases affect each other in multiple ways with lots of small feedback mechanisms.  I love the tension of the auctions. The key idea is that there is a battle going on between two dissimilar groups: the traders and the farmers. These groups are balanced in strength even though there are more farming interests than trading. Be sure to choose the winning side! You can't win by trying to be both.

After many more games it appears there is [i]lots[/i] going on that I did not see at first.  It is far more than traders vs. farmers—although that is a key theme.  Everything in Amun-Re has to be evaluated in relation to everything else, and the values change according to what stage in the game that you get it. 

BTW, Amun-Re scales well. There is a myth here on the geek that it needs five to be good. That's baloney. It is every bit as good with four, and quite playable with three.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Amun-Re is a bidding game in which there are multiple auctions--each player will get one of the provinces up for bid each round.  The provinces all provide different bonuses, and scoring cards in your hand may make some provinces better based on their location or their attributes, so provinces are worth different amounts to each player.  Bid amounts are fixed to triangular numbers, making it really important to try to figure out what others will bid, as going even one spot ahead of another player can get pricey.  The game is augmented by a building phase also based on triangular numbers, preventing people from saving up and doing too much in one turn.  This is one of my favorite auction games, there's just so much player interaction and so much to think about.

Don't even bother to play with less than 5 players, because it is compulsory to have all the areas, otherwise many of the bonus point cards seem rather useless. Auction system also seems rather pointless and empty with 3-4.

One of my favorite auction games. Evaluating the different provinces is really interesting, as their values change over the course of the game depending on one's particular strategy and set of scoring cards. The bidding system works wonderfully to force careful valuation as well as assessment of other players' values. 

I haven't played enough to have a good sense of how much depends on lucky draws of the right power cards, but there do seem to be good ways to ameliorate poor draws, such as focusing money not on winning particular provinces, but on building sets of pyramids or aiming for most pyramids on both sides.

A challenging and tense game. At this point Knizia is still putting together mathy bits (triangular progression, auctions, VPs) and the combo of mechanics still works (unlike, say, Palazzo).  There are benefits to every province, and you have to weigh them carefully.  There's a lot going on here, and several paths to victory.  Not much player interaction, which is involved almost entirely in the auction and (to a lesser extent) the sacrifice.

Knizia's best game imho. Quicker, lighter and more thematic than almost every other game he has done.  The competition in the sacrifices to Ra and the economics of farming versus caravans make for some very interesting gaming decisions.  Playing completely against the groupthink is a dangerous tactic but if you all think the same then you get very little benefit over your esteemed opponents. 

A great favourite for me especially considering the great swings in fortune that can occur between the old and new kingdom.  Finishing the old kingdom on 5 or less points is nowhere near the disaster that it seems so long as you have the cash to get all the best provinces in the new kingdom.

"Fresh" and "clever" are words that come to mind when describing Reiner Knizia's games but Amun-Re has neither.  But nonetheless, it's still a great solid game.  The "power cards" cheapens the game IMO and adds a silly element of luck into the game.  Played it a few times now, rating dropped down because "luck of the draw" will determine the winner amongst skilled players.

After one game, I'm craving more.  How to explain it.... I think what I like about this is that at first glance it seems 
cryptic and dull, but once you decipher the rules you can see a lot of interesting options on the board.  The 2-era/epoch setup is great, because pyramids built in the first will remain in the second - and up for anyone's takings!  A good theme, and I'd definately like to try again.

Played 2 games now, each 3 player -- this is my kind of game.  Neat bits, great concept, varying rounds, different goals, while also allowing players freedom to do as they wish, letting their true gamer characteristics shine through.  It's not cutthroat, but there is conflict - especially when 2 or more players are each desperately trying to win the auction of their shared victory territory.  More please.

I have played once, liked it, will have to play more to get a better feel for long term playability and so forth.  There is a lot going on in the game and wondering if there is too much going on?  Having said that, I did enjoy it so we'll see.

Good game, quick, easy for non-gamers to learn.  The auction mechanism can create somewhat of a learning curve, as experienced players will have a predisposition to what they think things are worth.  I really love the opportunity to steal from the offering to Amun-Re, a great ploy when you are needing those merchant camel points.

Appreciate the design, but felt a lot of potential points are tied up in card draws that may or may not happen. The long term strategy one could have is greatly affected by the choices and auctions they win, but feel those extra points could make the difference between a win or not too many times.

Excellent Knizia auction game. This is one of my very favorite games to play with experienced players. Sadly, it can be frustrating to play with people less skilled or experienced. Amun-Re requires calculations to find the best play. The question that the game asks of you is: 'Considering the optimum moves for the other players, what is my best course of action?' Finding your way through all the intricately interconnected aspects of the game, estimating expected values, and solving this constantly shifting puzzle can be extremely satisfying; winning feels like a true victory, one that you had to work for.

However, one player giving away a province too cheaply, messing up the sacrifice, or getting into an ill-advised fight, can throw off the entire balance. And when you've just racked your brain to find that 1 or 2 coin edge, seeing another province go for 20 coins less than it should, is not fun.

That makes Amun-Re a bit of an odd duck. While I normally play games for the social interaction, I'd rather play this online, and would perhaps even prefer playing against AIs. So, a game that breaks when people are being, well, people? It's not really the game's fault: chess is also only fun against experienced players willing to think.

Highly recommended if you have a group of 5 (or 4) serious gamers, willing to work their brains. But if even one of the players isn't in the mood for something heavy, do yourself a favor and find another game.

RATING: 7
First session with 5 which I personally found slowed the pace, increased the luck of getting desired power cards and made evaluation of each players vp status and intentions (during bidding and sacrificing) alittle foggy. Interesting mixture of mechanics and elements to consider, but feels alittle convoluted, though game sequence in Amun Re isn't repetitive as in Taj Mahal. Now played with 4, and more convinced that this is a 3 player game for easier assessment, and more skill involved. Finally played with 3 which made the provinces interestingly varied and game pace good. Amun-Re has some elements of Princes of Florence that I enjoy: the enforced pressure of matching conditions to get VPs and the bonus card and most money declaration at game end. In some ways, Amun-Re does it better than PoF: play is focussed centrally(rather than peripherally with individual playmats) making assessments easier; the "hare & tortoise/evo" bidding instils a tense and dramatic personality. I'm finding the game play and components provocative of the theme, so I'm charmed to play again. Just not sure if it will captivate the non-gamers I often play with.

This is a very challenging game with layers of short- and long-term planning, high degree of resource management, and lots of tough decision making. A very difficult game to formulate winning strategies. Very competative with great replayability value.
Increased my rating from 7 to 8 after 5 plays. 
Increased my rating again, from 8 to 9 after further plays.

Played this once and loved how the pyramids make the provinces extremely different in value in the New Kingdom (and often worth bidding up...making hoarding money for the New Kingdom a viable strategy). I had a lot of fun with this one...was way out in front after the Old Kingdom but settled for a tie for 3rd in a 5-player by game end. Hard to see who is really out in front due to the cards. Also thought the sacrificial bidding mechanic was neat (you can steal from the collection plate if you feel evil!)

Edit: A couple more plays and listening to the Metagamers' strategy podcast have elevated my rating to a 10. This game has the perfect mix of strategy and chaos for my taste and I can't recommend it enough.

Update: The power cards are slightly too swingy for this to maintain a 10 rating. Also, it needs an experienced group. Knocked it down a point.

It's a good game, but I don't like the power cards, too much luck in what you get and too important to get the right cards to make a high score. Still, the pyramids are cool and I really enjoy the egyptian theme and has some cool original elements.

My obsession with Knizia is getting a little out of hand, and Amun-Re was one of the few of his 'gamers' games' that I had yet to play. That was rectified in August (09) and it goes right up there with Ra and Taj Mahal and just behind Tigris & Euphrates (my all-time favourite board game). Like Ra and Taj it has an auction at its heart, but unlike those games there's more to it than just the auction. The auction itself has a nice mechanic and some difficult valuation problems. I also enjoy the bluffing and brinkmanship involved in the sacrifice phase. My only concern is that the power cards might be a little unbalanced and determine the winner in a close game.

Three times is the charm. I tried this twice before and hated it both times, I got screwed by the card draw. This time we played with a variant that allowed an extra card when drawing but the you had to discard down. IT helped, although one player still never drew any scoring cards. Won for the first time as well. Raised from a 4 to a 6.5 and am willing to play again to see if it improves. I still have reservations about the cards influencing the outcome too much.

One of my best games. Worth every second I have ever played it. So many killer decisions and tight mechanics that all depend on each other. My only complaint is that when playing with new players, you almost should bid on the camel provinces as new players will always be stingy with thier cash and never have enough/want to spend it on the sacrifice.

Solid, medium-complexity auction game. Lots of tough decisions regarding buying stone, farmers, and cards. The ancient Egypt theme is neatly tied into the game.

Another typical Knizia game. Simple yet the amount of option for VP is so divers that you need to wait until the final countdown to be sure of the winner. The theme isn't realy relevent and could have been anything. The bidding system is quite ingenious. A game were you are always on the lookout to balance money and victory points.

Un autre jeu typiquement Knizia, à la fois simple mais ou les possibilités pour obtenir des points de victoire sont tellement nombreuses qu'il faut vraiement attendre la fin de la partie avant savoir qui sera le vainqueur. Le theme n'est pas présent et aurait pu être n'importe quoi. Le système d'enchères est particulièrement ingénieux. Un autre jeu ou vous devez bien balancer vos choix entre les points de victoire et l'argent.

One of Kmizia's heavier games (a la Tigris & Euphrates) and once again, the theme is some random ancient civilization. In this case, it works very well because you are building pyramids and the game even plays in two epochs, the old and new kingdom, Egypt here we come ! The game can be very brainburning, especially for first-timers (like I was) because the scoring only takes place in 2 out of 6 rounds and as such, your actions and strategies build up to those phases instead of going for the quick points all the time. I love the auction mechanic that this game uses (the same as in 20th Century). There could be a tad more interaction in later phases, but what the heck, great stuff.

This game has two interesting auction phases per turn.  The second "sacrifice" auction is a communal blind auction that I've never seen in any other game.  The game gets low marks for being "fiddly".  It seems like a lot of time is spent fiddling with money, farmers, block, pyramids, cards, etc. and getting them in the right place and to the right player.  But the game is one I love to play.

I hate to admit it.  This game is good.  Knizia has actually scored one with me.  Damn him.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another Knizia classic!  I love all the strategic options the board offers: choice of provinces, farms or pyramids, and the interplay with the power cards.  Combine this with a strategic bidding round (the Sacrifice) which can reward low and high bidders, makes for a very fun and strategic game.  The only downside is the 3rd and 6th turns can lead to analysis paralysis, but even that is farily mild.  Great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
Rather dry exercise in resource collection.  It has an interesting 'auction' mechanism, but not enough player control over options, and not enough depth, to make it much of a game, in my opinion.  I'd probably be willing to play it again, though.

A Knizia game with a decent theme and some interesting auction and card-play mechanics. Amun-Re is one of those games that borders between merely 'good' and greatness, and I haven't quite made my mind up on it yet. Doesn't take away the fact that it's a pretty fun and competitive game to play, and worth the effort explaining the at-times (well, most of the time) tedious rules.

Only Knizia could have made this work so well. Susceptible to downtime, excessive mental book keeping, fiddly scoring and twiddly thumbs syndrome. But I love it. Typical Knizia with many ways to score and win. Not as clean as his older big box games and definitely needs the right crowd.

A bit confusing at first as it is hard to see what to do. After 4 play now? I can see a little bit of the diffente strategy.

RATING: 7
A tight game about spending just enough money to stay ahead of the other players in building pyramids while saving enough to win bids on choice locations. It's very easy to miss important details since workers, pyramids, and cards all kind of blend together to equal X amount of money and everything ties in to the auction which can end abruptly if you're not careful.

End scores tend to be tight, with the winner usually being the player who barely accomplishes some end game scoring goal. Overall, I don't feel the tension in this one as much as other players, and sometimes the scoring feels artificially close. It's a good Knizia, but by no means my favorite.

This game is fairly straight-forward, but is a fairly dry "convert money into VP" game. The auction mechanic is good in theory, but in practice is rarely that interesting. This is one of the very few Knizia games that feels under-developed: maybe the escalating costs for the auction don't work and stymie back-and-forth action; the power cards don't feel quite right as not drawing a VP card can be a major set-back and so maybe they need to be a separate decck or be draftable; and even the sacrifice round is a little too hard to finesse especially with regards to controlling turn order (which is critical but usually out of your power to determine). The time effects are nicely implemented causing quite different values for the three commodities across the game.

This is an interesting euro game that has a good mix of auction resource management and area control.  It has been thought of as another auction game by Knizia but really the feel of the game is area control that has auction and resource management on the side.  Only played with 3 and it seems there needs some stream lining with the cards with 3 players by I had a good time playing the game and the only real drawback was that there were a lot of cards that were not useable but you can get a coin for it at least.   first game was real close (4pts from first to last).  winner was determined by tiebreakers so there seems to be a real balance to the game.

A great strategy game, but a little heavy for some players, and success/failure often depends just as much on the other player's actions as your own.  To some, this might be part of its appeal, but others might get frustrated, especially if someone plays without fully understanding the implications of their actions.  This can make it really easy for another player to get a very large lead, or fall way behind.

The auction mechanic is fun and engaging. There are elements of set collection and area control that are puzzling and fun. I like adding to or stealing from the offering to help yourself. There are lots of ways to block and interact with the other players in this game.

Dislikes
Nothing specific to dislike. Can be a bit of a brain-burner trying to coordinate your sets and the area bonuses and the chaos of the auctions. This is not a bad thing but one is not always in the mood for brain-burning type fun.

Nice, elegant game.  I love it.  It&#039;s best to play it with someone who is overly competetive.  Bid them to death. Then, gime &#039;em the scroogy when they try for a flood and you bid -3 with a bidding adjustment power card.

~~after a LOT of online games (nb with open money)

Not my typical game but i seem to enjoy it. A thinky game that i feel even non-gamers would enjoy (will be trying it out on family at christmas). UPDATE: with more plays on sbw am finding it a bit too calculationary - nd to play more ptp methinks. Also i feel it's way too kingmakerish especially with newer players. however expect rating cld wll rise when finally play it irl

RECOMMENDATIONS:PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF - Princes of Florence.

RATING: 8
I enjoyed my first couple of plays.  Lots of neat mechanisms that intertwine while offering the opportunity to pursue different tactics in an attempt to maximize score.  Nice bits and look to the game also.  Only thing holding me back on the rating is that I did well in the first game with no clear strategy going in.  Perhaps that is the right attitude to have (react to the choices).  But I can't help but shake the feeling that luck of the power card draw has a factor in the game....Update, after a few more plays, still have the same thoughts with an even larger concern that the power card draw can unbalance the game.  I realize that one can spend money on cards as a choice to get the desired cards, but I still believe it adds too much luck into another wise tense little game.  Rating knocked down because of this....and because I firmly believe that this came must only be played with 5 players so that all provinces are in play instead of a random subset.

Seemed a little dry. Only one play under my belt so maybe I don't understand the game well enough but it seemed like almost all of the strategy was just how to value the different provinces... which isn't a deep enough game for me.

May need to re-acquire a copy.  John really liked this one.

I'm on the fence about Amun-Re.  Objectively, it's a great game and the one time I played it in person, I had fun.  At the same time, I've owned my copy for a year now and it has yet to hit the table.  Given how often I play games, that has to say something so I'm dropping the rating to 7.  I've played it a fair amount online as well, though (at SBW), and I'm finding I don't enjoy it as much there - probably related to the "play one turn then possibly wait for several days for someone else to play" factor that seems to kill auction games played by web.  For online play, I'm down to about a 5-6 unless turns happen really regularly. 

Mar. 30/09 = 61 plays at SBW to date (only 8 wins - I SUCK at this game!)

Pretty good auction game, but there tends to be very little outbidding until the final 2-3 rounds, and it is quite long for only having 6 bidding rounds in the whole game. I would always choose to play Vegas Showdown over this game, VS being more thematic and even though there are more options to choose to bid on each round, people are more likely to outbid each other just to prevent someone from getting something too cheap.  In Amun-Re, the risk of getting a province that you don't want (since you only get 6) is too high to outbid someone on something that's not the best choice for you.

--29Oct2005-- (after one play) A very nice design. Scoring is only modestly baroque for a Knizia - and summarized well on the (included) play aids.  Seems to play quite quickly, too.
(Though after a single replay, my enthusiasm is down a bit.  It's more tightly patterned and subject to card variance than I might prefer.  Not bad, though.)

A classic for a reason. All the points felt like a hard fought battle to gain, and felt very satisfying. The resin pyramid components are ridiculously cool, and actually feel thematic when halfway through the game the whole board gets wiped up except already built pyramids. If you haven't played it yet and like auction games, you're missing out. Even if you don't like auction games, you might like this one anyway since there's more to it than that.

Gola Hap-shet's session report got me interested in this game. It's very cool indeed, like a luckier / more approachable Princes of Florence. Plus it's got *two* super weird Knizia auctions per turn -- how cool is that?

After a bunch of games on SBW and a couple face to face, I'm finding that Amun-Re has a lot of replay value, and some subtlety in hand management etc. This is one of the better Knizias, I think.

Update: Dropped it a notch. The more you play, the greater the card randomness seems to be.

Update II: Becoming less enjoyable for me. I think initial turn order is an unbalancing factor too. Still a good game that I'm happy to play, but not up to the standard of Year of the Dragon etc.

One of the best pure auction games in the market, just one step behind from games like [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=245&Itemid=1]Phoenicia[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=1]Condottiere[/url][/i].  It has lots of things to think of, many combinations and options and an unintuitive Knizia's style scoring system.  The bidding mechanic, seen in other games like [i]Evo[/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=332&Itemid=1]Vegas Showdown[/url][/i], gives some room for players interaction, hard choices and strategy.

Randomness does not equate with luck.  Amun-Re demonstrates this.  The power cards provide balanced randomness.  You may not know which power cards you'll draw, but most of them will prove useful relatively soon.  It takes us a long time to play, but due to the round/phase structure, there is a sense of urgency throughout. 

Power cards are aptly named.  They're quite powerful.  After playing a second time, I can see that one's long-term strategy must take into account the power cards.  It's great to get bonus cards (a subset of power cards) early, so you can evaluate provinces with long-term payoff in mind. Choosing which provinces to pursue isn't just about immediate rewards.  No matter how enticing a province may appear, if it eliminates a potential bonus, think twice.  (Keep in mind, however,  that all bonus cards are only worth 3 points each, so they can only influence how much you're willing to bid for a province by so much.)

This is not to say that power cards are the key to victory -- only that ignoring them is risky.  It seems to me that it's a good idea to balance one's expenditures between no less than four of the five main avenues (province placement, power cards, farmers, pyramids and sacrifices), but I can imagine that as few as three of the avenues could work, so long as one of the three was power cards — and the [i]correct combination[/i] of power cards at that!

Four of the five sounds like a lot, but this is a rather subtle balancing act, and without power cards to add weight to certain expenditures, each arena must be well-represented. 

[COLOR=#006600][b]Possible variant: [/b][/COLOR]

Scott Nicholson says: "I wish the cards you bought were in two stacks - cards for bonus points and other cards. That would give you some well-needed choice about what type of cards you wanted."

Interesting idea for a variant.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

I avoided this game for some time.  I thought we had enough of "that sort of thing".  (Egyptian themed games?  Knizia middle-weights?)  Then we played it.  

Fun.  Challenging.  Engrossing.  

We own it because I enjoy the play throughout.

RATING: 8
Interesting game, and enjoyable. Decisions like many of the other great games, such as Puerto Rico and Prince of Florence.

Like many special power card games, you may want to correct slightly to fix problem of losing due to bad card draw. Suggested fix is "draw two, keep one".

In our group, this is a game that (almost) no one dislikes, and no one thinks is the best.

RATING: 5
Some of Knizia's older designs may have an evergreen flair, but unfortunately Amun-Re isn't one of those designs. To its credit, it is a touch more thematic than most Knizian classics and incorporates a few really clever mechanisms, such as the collusive sacrificial blind bid and the mid-game board wipe. But the overall package is peppered with tiny (yet important) rules exceptions and feels a little too dry. 

Another part of the problem is that elements of Amun-Re have since been adapted into more interesting titles which I'd rather play. The displacement-type auction is put to good use in designs like [thing=26566][/thing], and [thing=28720][/thing] implements the mid-game board wipe very well. The final nail in Amun-Re's sarcophagus is that the power cards are a ridiculous gamble. Given that cash is constantly tight, the idea of paying for a blind draw which could be worthless is terribly unappealing. A functional yet dated design.

[21 plays] 5,4, and 3 player games. Love it. A rare instance of immediately jumping up to a "10". Time will tell if it remains there, but for now, it is the game I most want to bring to the table again and again. It isn't easy to sum up my feelings about this game, but everything strikes a chord for me. The auctions are delightful, and everything else builds the tension around them.

Tentative rating.

Another Kniza auction machine, albeit with a slightly better sense of theme. Players are bidding on parcels of land in Egypt. The they use money to build Pyramids, place famers, etc.

There isn't the usual Kniza scoring twist but players score once midgame and re-bid on all provinces again and score again at the end. This means that if you spend too much money building early on and fail to reacquire the land, you're helping your opponent!

Heard that HiG asked Kniza to develop the power cards: good choice as it helps deepen gameplay.

Runs smoothly although I think that it's a little fiddly with all the components to move around the board.

Fair Knizia game, although the elements are a bit too familiar from other better games (his own "Ra" - his masterpiece). Tries the Puerto Rico concept of ripping good mechanics out of other games to put them together into something new - but it doesn't work as well as that game. Not sure I believe the whole Knizia story that he doesn't play anyone else's games (although he obviously takes mostly from his own but...uh...I'm pretty sure he's played Tikal after playing Amun-Re).

After a few plays this stands atop my "Knizia best" games. Amun-Re is as terrific a game as they come, filled with many choices and quick playability. Superb game to play on www.spielbyweb.com. This game is like entering a mad crazy go cart race ... every time it ends, I just can't get enough (irregardless if I win or lose). I just want to jump back in and go for it again!

This game is great fun, with bidding, buying, building, and plenty of agonizing choices to be made. The auctions in particular, are very well done and the game has excellent replay value. The power cards are somewhat unbalanced, but this only means that you have to be flexible with your strategy, e.g. no good VP cards, go for pyramid bonuses instead. There are many ways to win in this game.

Auction/bidding mixed with area control.  

The separate phases means players will have to pay to maintain their powerful areas or give it up to someone else.

RATING: 9
Yet another refinement of a Knizia auction game that everyone liked.  The board is (approximately) a 4x4 grid of provinces with the Nile running down the middle.  An auction system ensures everyone buys control of one province a round.  You then stock up your provinces by buying farmers, who make money, and pyramids, which make victory points (in a variety of obtuse ways).  Everyone then &quot;sacrifices&quot; additional money into the harvest: the combined sum of everyone&#039;s sacrifice determines how much money each farmer gets you.  After explaining all this, you&#039;d better play sample rounds, as there are all sorts of rules that only make sense after trying it.  You can spend money on random power cards, which either give you little perks or reward you victory points for shaping your strategy in unusual ways.  After everyone has populated 3 provinces, you calculate score.  You then clear out everything BUT the pyramids, do another 3 rounds, then do a final scoring.  To win you must combine your provinces and power cards into a strategy that finds as many different ways to score victory points without costly head to head clashes with others.  Monetary decisions include competitive bidding for provinces, working around penalties for buying too much of the same thing, and determining if harvests benefit you or your competitors more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Theme of building pyramids in Egypt and sacrificing for the harvest works well enough.  

With only 6 rounds (with the 3rd and final rounds being scoring rounds), I find that the game plays quickly and does not overstay it's welcome.

Nagy várakozással ültem le a játékhoz, amit bőven hozott, sőt. Nagyon jó licitmechanizmus, nagyon jó vásárlási megoldás, többfajta stratégia és egyáltalán nem bonyolult és nehéz játék az Amun-Re. 3-an játszottuk és meglepően jól működött, furcsa számomra a BGG-s nem ajánlott szavazás 3 fő esetére. Érdekes a két korszak megoldása, hogy egyes elemek felépítve maradnak a területeken, amelyeket újra meg kell szerezni. Nagyon jó játék az Amun-Re, talán egyetlen negatív megjegyzésem, hogy úgy éreztem a játék során, hogy aki az első korban lemarad sajnos nem sok esélye van javítani később sem. De ez majd talán több játék során jobban megmutatkozik.
Bátran ajánlom kevésbé gémereknek is. Szép kivitelezés, nagyon jó téma és szuper játékmechanizmusok.

[2012-01-14]
Nos bőven van javítási lehetőség a második korban, szóval ilyen negatívum nincs a játékban. Viszont a bónuszkártyák húzásakor fellépő szerencse annyira nem jól jön az amúgy teljesen szerencsefüggetlen játékba. Ettől függetlenül nagyon jó játék az Amun-Re, a pont most véglegesnek tűnik.

[2013-04-15]
A bónuszkártyák szerencsefaktora miatt mégis kénytelen vagyok rontani a pontot. Ugyanolyan szintű játékosokkal is simán lehet, hogy valaki könnyedén nyer egy játékot, a másikban pedig utolsó lesz. Ez azért a legjobb játékokra nem jellemző nálam. Ettől függetlenül a kártyákon kívül minden más nagyon tetszik benne.

VERY nice bidding and building game!

Cons: Definitely, again in true Reiner style, at times the scoring can be overly complicated. The rules are a bit awkward to learn and it takes a bit of hard work - moreso dedication :)

Pros: Once you get the rules, its a really decent game! Nice theme, multiple point strategies and some minor conflict and good competetion. A bit more 'adult' style strategy than usual for Reiner, and I would suggest that this game is for the 'thinkers'.

This is undeniably a good game.  I can see how people could love it, I guess.  I just have a hard time getting into it. Perhaps, because it is dry and mechanical. Perhaps, becuase it takes everything you have away from you as an easy out to prevent a runaway leader. 

I think that the easiest thing to forget about the game is that it is purely a "group think" system. Yes, there is a heavy level of clinical analysis (if you  want that sort of thing in a game), but it is irritatingly difficult to gauge what anyone values a region at.  Being outbid is eyerolling as it becomes incrementaly more difficult to remain in play. It seems you want to start with what the group value is for an item, but even still you are subjected to the folly and whimsey of another players disinterest in changing their strategy forcing themselves to perhaps pay too high, but leaving you with crap for options.  

Clearly that is the game. Usually a game that forces changes in strategies are exciting to me, but I feel that your options are dictated arbitrarily by others that, while justifiably, sometimes it comes from the betterment of their game, I feel that often time it comes from tertiary moves when there are no other engaging options available.  It also seems that there is often a dramatic difference in pricing for regions, but because different regions yield asymetrical results often a player can continually walk away with the regions they want for nothing, because other players aren't pursuing their strategy, yet there is no real incentive to keep that player honest as their regions would only set you out of the game if you were to win it.

The components are quite nice, and there is a fine balance to the game.  But at the end of the day, what it all comes down to for me was that there was just no fun factor.  I would probably play it again if someone offered, but I certainly wouldn't ask for it to come off of the shelf.  One of those classic games that walks a fine line between irritating and boring.

UPDATE: This has recently been downgraded to a 3.  After playing an utterly unexciting and repetitious game of Amun-Re I was made aware of just how much this game isn't for me.  BTW here is some advice, don't draw all Master Builder cards.

The theme works pretty well, and I enjoy the idea of Amun-Re-worshipping agriculturists vs. the nomads of the high desert sneering at the god in hopes of bringing about a poor harvest. As with many Knizia games, the complicated scoring system can make it difficult to formulate objectives. The bidding system is interesting; it took me a few turns to catch on to the fact that if you really want a province, you had better put in a high bid right away, because you might not get a second chance.

RATING: 7
I like the auction mechanism, I like the thematic tie-in with the passage of time and endurance of monuments, and I like the sacrifice mechanism.  I had to ding it from an 8 to a 7 because it really needs exactly 5 to play (otherwise you don't use all 15 provinces, which affects 3 of the 5 scoring power cards).  I'm concerned that the path to victory may be simply reduced to getting as many power cards as possible, but it will take more plays to confirm or refute that.  For now, it's a game that I look forward to playing.

I wish the cards you bought were in two stacks - cards for bonus points and other cards.  That would give you some well-needed choice about what type of cards you wanted.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
3 rounds then score; then repeat. Each round, auction (using an innovative method of predefined bid increments; if you're overbid you must bid on something ELSE -- similar to Vegas Showdown) for a province. Each province has different characteristics (# farmers allowed, earnings modifiers, # power card purchases allowed, bonuses awarded to auction winner). After the auction, players take turns buying stuff -- again with escalating costs (first is 1, second is 2, ...): power cards, then farmers, then building stones (for pyramids). The round ends with everyone making a blind sacrifice (or stealing 3 gold); non-stealers get a reward(s). Finally, scoring: get points for pyramids, sets of pyramids, most pyramids on one (or both) sides of the Nile, control of 3 particular provinces (VP payoff related to total sacrifice amount), and various power card bonuses. (Power cards also modify play throughout the game). After the first scoring, the process is repeated using the SAME provinces that came up previously (but with farmers removed; only pyramids and building stones stay from early kingdom (1st phase) to late kingdom. Most points at end wins!

This is a fun game; auctions can be tough, and the sacrifice for Ra is fun - especially since the rewards themselves can change scoring. The auction mechanism works well, too. We don't get this on the table much, but I've played a bunch on spielbyweb now - excellent implementation!

My rating could still fluctuate in either direction, but I think Amun Re may be overrated due to its author.  The design doesn't feel tight to me.  Rather, the cards seem too powerful, so many of the decisions during the game aren't as meaningful as they appear at first glance.  Also, the scoring system seems too convoluted.

RATING: 7
This is a standard auction game with one pretty unique feature that really elevates it and makes you think differently about the game than most others.

In this players will bid to win auctions of regions at the start of each round.  The regions will provide many different benefits from income, to farmers that will increase income based on that round's harvest, to building blocks for building pyramids, to special action cards that give players additional abilities.  After each player has won an area they spend money to buy stuff.  Either farmers, action cards, or building blocks.  Everything except the building blocks is limited by the region(s) they own.  The building blocks are arguably the most important from a scoring perspective though as once you buy three for an area it becomes a pyramid and those are worth the most points.

The really unique feature for this game though is that after 3 rounds the board gets scrubbed...almost.  Everything disappears, including players ownership of regions, except the pyramids which stand the test of time.  So for the second half of the game when regions show up at auction you may be bidding on an area where there are already some pyramids built and like I said those are worth the most points.

This creates a really interesting dynamic.  Every pyramid you build in the first half of the game could go to another player or not even show up at auction at all during the second half.

Not to mention the rest of the game is decent too, it doesn't do a whole lot new, at least not for 2015 (this game was originally released 12 years ago), but is a more standard auction/economic game.  It's this neat changing of ages that really makes it stand out.

Played this game with some old gaming friends from my childhood so it was a real "blast from the past"-experience. A different auction mechanic with some area control and the building of pyramids in a nice mix. The theme exists, and the plastic (?) pyramids are of good quality, but it's not so strong as I would like. I especially like the cleaning of the slate mid game (like Brass) when different areas suddenly became more valuable and available. The auction mechanic is almost the same as in Cyclades and I think its better done in that game. I had anyhow a fun time beating my old buddies and can play this game more times with a smile on my face. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a two part auction game. The first part of the game is you auction off the different areas on the board. Then all the locations will be wiped except for the pyramids. Now the locations will be reauctioned. I prefer Ra, but I'm also not a fan of area control. I also found the cards to be too random. This game very much needs a player aid for the scoring. It was very frustrating to constantly pass around the rule book to remind yourself what is being scored.

I think played the latest version (2017 kickstarter?) and it had a nice production value. The pyramids were very well made.

I'm rather precariously balanced atop the "take it or leave it" fence with regards to this particular game.  It's got enough elements in play to make it somewhat interesting, yet it still comes across as feeling dry as the desert sand.  At first glance there appears to be a fair bit to figure out, particularly with regards to auctioning provinces and giving sacrifices, but it is fortunately a simpler game than appearances would lead you to believe.  Not a bad game.  Not a great game.  Would be willing to play it again, however for my ancient Egypt fix I tend to prefer "Cleopatra and the Society of Architects".

The components are very good - colorful mounted gameboard, thick chits, ceramic playing pieces, and somewhat durable small size cards.  The rulebook is very good too, well written, in color, and contains many examples.  Game length is good at about 90 minutes.

[many plays]  A great game.  Fairly easy to learn, and plays at a good pace.  Yet it is very strategic with auctions and blind group resource allocation as the main player interaction.  It seems like there is a number of ways to win.  I have had a good time each time we have gotten this game out.  Played it with the co-workers at work over lunch.  It didn't go over great.  The biggest problem is it took just over 2 hours to play which was way too long for over lunch.  Some of them thought it was okay, one person hated it, no one loved. They probably would cumulatively rate it about 5-6 or so,  my regular gaming group on the other hand likes this game a lot more, and probably would have it around 7-8.

I was really looking forward to this since it's supposed to be such a classic, but I found it to be more complicated than I'd like. I was overwhelmed with all the actions and had a hard time remembering what was what, but that just may be my cognitive impairment. It's also surprisingly luck-based due to the power cards, and eventually, I just couldn't get engaged.

[RGG 2003 Edition] {Egypt; blind-bidding, bidding, secret-goal, area-majority, epic, utility cards; optimal 5p} I have been to Egypt before and have an enjoyable time. For this reason, I like Egypt-themed games. And, I bought Amun-Re without much thinking. It turns out that Amun-Re is a decent strategy game with high replayability but a thin theme. Knizia nicely integrates several mechanics into Amun-Re: open bidding with multiple objects, blind bidding, area-controls and resources management. Despite the multiple mechanics, it is not overly complicated. Yet, it takes some time to explain the rules clearly.

Player interaction is strong in Amun-Re: there is strong competition in bidding the provinces, building pyramids and contribution to Amun-Re.  Players have to concentrate on how each player acts. Without knowing what others will do, a player can hardly win this game.

Amun-Re is multi-faceted - there are multiple ways of winning.  In addition, it is a tight resources management game.  As a result, it can be agonizing. Yet it is only moderately deep and down time is not very strong.  It is a game requiring good planning and is quite unforgiving. Since resources are tight and actions are limited, a player needs a definite plan to collect victory points: which provinces to occupy, how much contribution to make, etc. Bidding part is also tricky - the EV of each province changes during each turn of the game. It's also hard to determine the contribution to Amun-Re. 

Knizia makes Amun-Re even more dynamic with the 2-epoch system. If construction buildings are not destroyed in an epoch, the game will be static and everyone can calculate the score determinedly. With the 2-epoch system, it thwarts this deep calculation because everything except pyramids will be destroyed after the first epoch.

I was amased  to see this rated Knizia offering suffering from so many problems.

The game provides the perfect environment for:

1) Analysis Paralysis - Our first five player game went on for over 3 hours.

2) End game Bonus Cards that offer an 'all or nothing' bonus and no incremental rewards, for just missing out.

3) This is incredibly compounded by one of the  worst 'Kingmaking' mechanics I have ever witnessed. A trailing player with little or nothing to play for but with enough funds, can choose which of the two leaders he wants to screw with. As the leaders will probably have been forced to invest everything, in an 'all or nothing' region, the losing player chooses the winner abitrarily, presumably based on who he thinks may be leading at the time or some other such personal reasoning. Quite absurd.

Sure, there are some things in hindsight that I could have done to mitigate this, like trying to conceal any interest in my current Region but this would be covering for a much broken and easily abused mechanic and I no longer feel inclined to try.  

Amun Re is an absolutely awful experience in the wrong circumstances and fully deserving of one of the lowest ratings that I have ever given to a game. 

A BGG rating of 2 is by definition a game I would never play again.

It has some interesting mechanics like the bidding mechanism. This works brilliantly in games like Evo where it allows you to improve you dinosaurs' ability by small increments. But Knizia is mis-using it here as an integral part of the game for major game altering effects. 

I choose to outbid all the other reviewers that made this a top 50 'hit' and relegate it to the bottom of the table. Why? Because I can and have nothing to lose by doing so. 

Following in the footsteps of Ra: with it's a fast, tense and well integrated mechanisms, Amun Re demonstrates that even the better game designers can miss the mark by a country mile.

Advice: Stay well clear!

RATING: 8
Nearly all games have a theme but there seem to be few games where the mechanics of the game actually have any relation to the theme.  This is one of those games, and for that, I think it should be commended.  It is a fun and interesting game that uses a number of different concepts during each turn.  There is an auction phase, an purchase and asset management phase and a rather fun secret offering phase.  While player interaction on the board is minimal there is plenty of fun interaction during the bidding and offering phases and there is plenty of opportunity to hamper your opponents' progress.  My only criticism is that, even though it is not a difficult game to play, the rules are not particularly well written for a game that has quite a few different phases that need explaining.  But, that small negative is outweighed by the positives, fun interaction, great looking game, varied mechanics & strategies and a game that actually seems to match its theme.

Some interesting interlocking mechanisms in the game.  The power cards seemed to vary wildly on their impact to the game.  The auctioning was not as dramatic as in Medici or RA but there is a small element of jockeying and bluffing to it that I liked.  Money seemed to be tight and loose at times in the game.  You really need to understand the other player's motivations to effectively make the right size offering.  Overall, I thought it was fine, but not nearly as good as the other Knizia auction games.

Amun-Re is right up there with the likes of El Grand, Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico.  It is awash with theme, and looks absolutely stunning. The components are top notch, with the pyramids and stones having an authentic tactile feel to them. The artwork is gorgeous, and as with all Hans Im Gluck games, the meaning of the cards can be understood straight away.  

This is an easy game to play. Its not a heavy brain burner, but the different phases during each round offers variety in game-play and strategy and gives the players plenty to think about. It plays quickly, and the advertised play time of 90 minutes is spot on.

Played mostly on SBW.  It's a fun game.  I definately enjoy it.

It is not as good on SBW as it is in real life, just simply because the auction rounds take so long to play through.  

This one is a really tight game with unique mechanisms not available in any other game, because of the changing of the land from the old kingdom to the new kingdom, it is very thematic as well, and would not work with any other theme.

This game requires no further introduction, I am sure. Each player takes on the role of Pharaoh aiming to build the most pyramids and bring the greatest glory to Amun Re and his fellow Gods.

It incorporates auctions, farming, the clever use of power cards, offering to the Gods and a lot more. The theme is there, even if this is often held against the honourable Mr. Knizia, and you feel present, you feel like the Pharaoh trying to best your annoying family members all trying to supplant you.

The game plays from 3-5 players and best at 5, according to the BGG community. Our one play with 3 players showed the potential in this title, but also that it requires accomplished players to function. If one player is unaware of the intricacies of the game and its mechanics, the others may well feel the sting.

It requires an investment of time and through it a familiarity with the game to play smoothly and in a decent time frame. Our play took up to 3 hours, which did not feel long, but repeat plays at this length would - there is not enough to hold the interest as such.

Our caveat is, however, based on the required player count. The game was purchased on its reputation, without regard to the nature of our gaming group. It has for this reason been sold off.

Played this as a 5-player game, which I think is the best way to play this since it ensures that all provinces are taken. The auction mechanic reminds me of Vegas Showdown, but different in the sense that there are exactly X number of provinces to auction for X players which makes it a whole lot more competitive. The rest of the game seems pretty stock-standard of "get gold, build stuff" with some bonus Power cards thrown in. A good game, but I've got other games with similar mechanics and more interesting themes.

Never planned on buying this game, but it was on sale at WOTC. Really enjoy it and I think it'll be something our group will always come back to play.

I need a lot more 2 gold cards. Always seems to be running low on those. It might be from people breaking a 5 gold card to buy one item and need 4 back.

It's interesting how different this plays depending on how much people sacrifice. One game where two our of five people kept putting in -3 caused the games to grind down to little money all around. So everyone would spend most of their money purchasing. Bids and sacrifices were low. It was rare that we touched the 20 gold card.

In another game, we made a good sacrifice and money was plentiful. We bid more and sacrificed more. I think we bought more too.

Interesting game with a slightly different bidding/auction mechanic than most of Knizia's games. But in the end, there is just something that doesn't grab me about this game.

Auction based area control knizia? Sign me up! I am a big fan of auction based games as it really stimulates player interaction.

The communal sacrifice (helping farmers while hurting traders) mechanic helps make the game great. Very enjoyable.

Amun-Re is a solid and thoughtful title, but it doesn't have enough energy.

I appreciate the multiple strategies you can pursue. But there is too much luck of the draw when it comes to the power cards: the bonus cards are so much more useful than the special ability cards. And the auction system is too inflexible to be enjoyable. You have one shot to get the province you want/need. If someone overbids you, it is almost impossible to get another shot at it.

Knizias' best to my concern. What I really like about it is the non-linear path. If you build up, you have to consider, that you aren't necessarily doing it for your own good, but that halfway through the game the "cards" are being reshuffled. And with "cards" I mean odds!

Very solid auction game, which encourages a very high dose of reactive play as you are constantly moving your targets around the power cards you acquire and the properties you win in the auctions.

Overbidding is punished harshly, which may turn some off, but I'm fine with it.

First Impression:

A tough auction game.

Good Interaction without kingmaking and tough decisions without complex rules and analysis paralysis. A relatively elegant design that flows fairly well.

Whatever little theme is there is hardly ispiring. Modern games have spoiled me as I expect at the very least a decent attempt to carry the theme; this game falls back in this category.

I'd play again gladly as I think the game is very solid, but I'd also pass it without complain because of the theme.

The more I play this, the more I like it.  Great economic game system.  Does involve quite a bit of calculation to  figure your optimal bid and build, but I like some of that in a game.  Two mechanics that stand out are the clever auction process (bids in fixed increments that make overbidding progressively more expensive) and the fact that pyramids stay on the board between ages but ownership of provinces is re-auctioned, which means your buildings in the old kingdom can benefit someone else in the new if they have more gold with which to buy the built-up provinces.

Only real downside to this game is that it is so much better with 5 than with fewer players that it isn't worth playing unless there are 5 at the table.

Fun game.  Many decisions, a lot to look at, but at the same not an overwhelming amount to look at.  A gamer's game for nice medium weight.  I like how my brain is forced to work in this game.  High replayability.  Actually, the more I play this game the more I like it.  The nuances and tricks of this game slowly reveal themselves.  I think thats incredible.  Amun-Re is 70% resource management and 30% group-think.  The group-think aspect of the game is fantastic.  I like games that shine when every opponenet is comfortable with the game system and competent.  Amun-Re is one.  For me the game scales from 5-5 players.  I'm not sure how well it plays with 3 or 4, because I never play it with that number.


The sacrifice is one of my favorite game mechanics.  This is why this one is a keeper.  The more I play this the more I like it.

I like this game but it's one of those that I can't seem to figure out how to win at! :)  I seem to be doing OK in a lot of areas then it comes to scoring and. . . well I just don't advance as much as everyone else.  A good game no doubt though.

While it's only Reiner Knizia's fifth best game, that's just because nothing can top Tigris & Euphrates, Through the Desert, and Ra (plus it's just behind Taj Mahal).  This is an excellent game that combines a variety of mechanisms. I really like the concept of splitting the game up into the Old and New Kingdoms, and losing control of provinces but keeping the pyramids.  This is one of Dr. Knizia's most thematic and engaging games, plus the pieces/board are really nicely done.

Wow, what a great game [thing=5404][/thing] is!

Every decision has some sort of consequence: do I try to take this awesome province, but it will cost me. Then will I have money for stones, cards and farmers? And how much will I have left to give to Amun-Re? If Amun-Re stays in the 1 or 2 spot, my farmers won't help me enough for my next round. And this goes on and on. I really enjoy this sort of mind exercise. There is room for AP, but this is a problem of the players, not the game.

That happens because:
- At first you will need money for provinces (might not be much, will depend on how much the others want to fight for a place) - do you go for the one with a free stone? With place for farmers? With garanteed income? The one near the water? The one in the West bank?;
- Now you will need money for stones, farmers and cards - stones build pyramids, that translates to points, but you must remember that, in the New Kingdom (the second stage of the game), other player might take hold of the province;
- Now you will need money to offer to Amun-Re - how much will you get if it goes to 3? How much will the others? How bad do you want those three items? Maybe two will be enough, but how much will get you second place? It is time to go with the -3 card, get nothing more than 3 money, but you just might hinder the others deeply;
- Now you will receive some money, but the amount will depend on the level of the sacrifices for Amun-Re, and also due to the income provided by some provinces. You should have give more to Amun-Re? Well, now it is to late.

[thing=5404][/thing] might just be the game I was looking for to close the Holy Trinity of Knizia's games, along side [thing=3][/thing] and [thing=12][/thing]. And yes, they all can stay in the same collection, because they play so different from each other - [thing=12][/thing] is closer in theme and because both are auction games, but [thing=5404][/thing] didn't feel to me as much as an auction game, more like a work placement where the workers are money, piramids, farmers. It is hard to put into words, but if you play [thing=5404][/thing] and [thing=12][/thing] back to back, you will know what I mean.

The game also has nice bits, and the artwork, though not great, does its job rather well - the action cards are easy to understand even for players learning it.

I rate [thing=5404][/thing] "only" at 8, mainly because I need to explore it further.

I love an Egyptian theme, and this does feel quite in the spirit, with ownership and farming starting again after the flood but buildings left behind.

I struggled a bit with the auctions, as my wont, but the fixed set of bid prices helped, as well as the way you're selecting between several auctions at once.

I'd definitely give this another go.

Amun-Re was an enjoyable auction/resource management game that, in my one play, didn't have very cutthroat auctions. I still enjoyed the game, I was just surprised by the "everyone gets something okay"-ness of the auction portion; while there were certainly some locations better than others, it seemed to be good decisions in other parts of the game that really determined success. I liked the triangular costs for each thing you could buy, the sacrificing phase, the card play and risks therein, and the overall flow. But the similar auctions in games like Vegas Showdown and Cyclades just seemed to work better for me.

RATING: 6.5
Not bad for my first play with 5 players.  Finished third 2 points out of first place without ever pulling a scoring power card.  Part of this was card draws and the other part was that 3 of the players were experienced and kept hoarding the scoring cards whenever they picked them up.  With any luck, I could have been a first time winner.   

I see the potential for king making in this game by the player in last place.  To be perfectly honest, I believed I was way out of the game (forgot about the temple scoring - I had 2 temples) and decided to screw the player in first place by competing with him for the 5 point bonus for most pyramids.  Turns out I really helped myself by gaining the 5 points and he still finished 1st 2 points ahead.

All in all a decent game that will move much faster now that I know what the cards do and don't have to keep looking them up.  Also, a power card hand limit would definitely balance things out. 

My rating may go up depending on how my second game plays out.

Amun-Re is one of Knizia's heavier auction games. However, I love the theme in this game. The way the auction is conducted is different from other auction-style games It allows for last minute comebacks and unexpected swings in scoring. The management of money and scoring is tight and I love the uniqueness of the final offering. Thumbs up for the Knizia game and will ask for it anytime

Have only played it with 3p so far, which was a surprising pile of garbage for a Knizia design. I've heard this is way better with 5p, so I'll be reserving judgement until then.

UPDATE: Sold off before it got a second chance, plus-sized box and narrow player count ensured it never got picked over other titles. Shame.

Taught by BeyondMonopoly and others at PrezCon 04.  After two plays, this is a great, tight game.  There are alot of choices and many paths to victory, but not too surprisingly for a Knizia game, balance and efficiency are key.  You can pay through the nose to get exactly what you want, but you will be beaten by a frugal player.  You can be frugal and get by, but the player willing to pay for valuable things will win.  The correct path is probably in the middle and influenced by the people you are playing with.

Update:  Played my 3rd game and came in 2nd for the third time...  This time was with my regular game group.  The game played out a little differently, but still ended up with three players within a three point span at the lead.  Raised my rating from an 8 to a 9.

RATING: 6
This lacks some of the thrill of Knizia's other games and to my mind has needless complexity and too many ways to score points. One element I love, however, is that pyramids stay on the board from kingdom to kingdom. So what you developed to score points on in the first half of the game may score points for someone else if they outbid you in that province in the second half of the game. Still, not as nailbiting as Ra.

RATING: 6.5
I liked it a lot less after a 2nd play (rating from 8 to 6.5). The decisions in each phase are tricky and tension-inducing, which I like a lot. The auction, when taken alone, is great and leads to all kinds of double think and wonderfuly "gamey" feelings. The sacrifice too, a nice bit of fun-- even though I am not a huge fan of blind bidding (except in the case of Raj!) this is ok. And how to spend the money? Nail-biter for sure, especially when money is tight. Where it doesn't work for me is how all three things come together and interact once the very random cards are thrown in the mix. I think the variation in powers that the cards give leads to too much luck. In the two games I've played, I cannot look at various moments and say, "ahh that is when I  made a mistake!" instead I say to myself, "Ahhh, that is when I got so #$%$ (un)lucky." The victory seems to come down to whoever has the most "@#$#% lucky!" moments. When I presented this opinion to my game friends they suggested I was missing how much planning led to getting lucky-- or the "You make your own luck" defense of luck. I'm happy to play another few times to hopefully learn they are right! I'll revise accordingly then. But in the meantime, it gets added to the list of Knizia games that my freinds love, but leave me sort of meh. (ps. I'm *not* looking at you Modern Art!)

I never really feel engrossed in it.  Every individual mechanic in the game works, and they interact well, but I just never get the sense of tension that develops in my favorite Eurogames.

I think it hits a good level of complexity, but I think it ultimately falls just short of good game into "just another Euro" category.

(April 2011 update) - All recorded plays are face to face.  I find this game interesting with newbies who throw off the "scripted" nature that this one sometimes takes with certain players.    The cards do play a big factor in the game and "unlucky" draws can hurt, but it is a game - not a pure abstract with perfect info.


(2008)  After a 2nd face to face game, I am impressed with this game.  Works best with 5 players.  Play online at SBW a lot.

First Play - 5 players. Myself and another player were brand new to the game. The other 3 were seasoned vets. The rules were explained and they were simple enough. The power cards are all expalained on the back page of the manual. The entire game reminded me of a cross between Ra, Vegas Showdown and Masons. Bid, build and score. Proper bidding seems to be the difference between first and second and of course some luck as to which power cards you draw and when. I surprised myself by tieing for the lead at the end of the game on the scoring track and then by winning the game due to have 9 pyramids to the vet's 8. Using the last of my money to stay the Chosen one and getting the three stones needed to buld that 9th pyramid was the difference between first and possibly fourth!

It's an auction game blended with an area control game, and it comes together into a nice mesh of both.  There are several different sorts of auctions in the game, but it never feels strictly like an auction game; instead, it feels unique and interesting.  There are some issues with the randomness of the power cards granting a player a large number of points at the right time, but you also have to plan for some of those situations.  Best with 5 players, I think.  Its main issue with me is that it just feels very much like a standard Euro cube-pusher, and it doesn't give the game much staying power, even though it's a decent overall game.

Like many other Knizia games, this game has a bidding element which is crucial to your success especially at the later half of the game. The mechainics and options are well balanced and it will be tough to find a spoiler victory strategy in this game. Turn lag can be an issue with less exprienced players, but it only adds to your anticipation giving you a nail biting feeling. This is also a game in which you can't really have a set strategy going in as you have to be reactive. I had a blast playing it for the first time and winning that game is always a plus. ---Patrick :)

The primary reason I like this game is its theme to mechanics link. 

At its heart it is an economic game where you need to turn money into points efficiently. The theme is woven into this economic engine very well though. 

There is also bidding and simultaneous action phases, so subjective valuation of items and double guessing are also present.

My first plays were all with five players, so I was shocked to discover how differently this game plays with three -- and not simply because certain provinces never come into play. The value of the provinces varies greatly depending on when they come out and how many players you have, and that aspect of the game really appeals to me.

You have to judge what others will do on their turn, which will affect the sacrifice, your income (and theirs), and your bonus (if any), which drives the later rounds. Everything is interconnected and driven by the actions of the players, so reading your opponents is crucial to good play. This makes the game tougher for newbies, but hopefully they'll stick with it, perhaps on Spielbyweb where they can play many games quickly.

Great game, enjoy it tremendous! Very good auction system, we have had some hard 'fighting'-auctions during the 2nd Kingdom over some 'key' provinces. People complaining over the 'luck' of the power cards, should stop taking them too often...

A great game, rating is based on first play.  If anything, I see this rating going up, not down.  The board clearing mechanic was very interesting, and made the New Kingdom auctions EXTREMELY interesting.  Make sure with fewer than 5 players you do not use the -3 cards for offerings.
NOTE:  Increased rating to 9.  This game is great.  I think it is underestimated by some.

Board and pieces are great. Second time of playing and I  like it more than I did before.  It is similar to Goa in many ways - bidding for tiles/provinces first is player interaction and then a puzzle to use the resources you have most effectively, and buying cards to help you while keeping an eye on your opponents score.

One of my favorite Reiner Knizia games.  A full complement of odd scoring mechanisms wrapped around a whole bunch of decisions.  

Knocked down form 9 to 7.5 several years later.  The game hasn't aged as well as I would have thought.  Some of the mechanics are a bit odd, particularly the random cards.  Scoring cards are relatively important, and there often isn't much you can do to get them.

Played with 5, more fun with more ppl so that all areas gets to be bidded on and more chances to bid over others. as with other knizia games, alot of different ways to score.. money is not as tight as it could be, meaning alot of luck involve in the cards you buy.. definately very enjoyable, not the best however

The best auction game I've played to date. Everything is fairly balanced. There are very few chances for people to break the system. Players only receive advantages if other players let them get off with it for a cheap price at the auction. Can't speak highly enough of this board game.

A great auction and strategy game, with great components. The sacrifice to Amun-Re can go high, and it becomes a game of Temples, or the sacrife can stay
low and it becomes a game of Pyramids. A very fluid and tense game.

This great game has all the elements for a rich game playing experience. Egypt's cool cultural history is happily married  to a competitive pyramid-building game mechanic with lots of dynamic options and directions to take your kingdom. Love the concept of the Old Kingdom leading into the New Kingdom. The game is wonderfully produced -- especially the plastic pyramid pieces. This game should be in your collection!

Auction strategy to place farmers for income and build pyramids for area control of Eygypt.  One of my favorite auction mechanics placing a player pawn on escalating value card tracks until all players have won a territory ( works best with full player counts).  I love the themactic relationship of the destructive but revitalizing powers of the Nile river floods washing away the farmlands along the delta and how this plays on short and long term strategy of the re-auctions.  I also like the elegant market mechanic for increasing unit costs with larger quantity purchases.  Visually, the appearance of pyramids over the rounds is satisfying and I love how it conveys the passage of time. The gifts to the Gods phase is another highlight that drives opposing player objectives for points or income mathing out the gift value of your territories while predicting the gifts of the other players (also better with higher play counts). Lowest common denominator scoring is another strategy factor that I enjoy.

A classic auction and action game. I love the area auction mechanic, and I really like the "offer to Amun-Re" and the way it influences the Nile level, which then influences income from farms or caravans. I feel very much like I'm playing the players in this game - a hallmark of Knizia games.

Add me to the list of those who were underwhelmed by Amun-Re. Played one 5 player game. The "luck of the draw" re the Power cards can be overwhelming. I got 5 builder cards in the game and 1 increase farmer income. One other player got one builder card. We were both somewhat screwed by this. Didn't like it with three. Too much rides on the initial auction bids, the values are too calculateable, "camel" strategy can be overwhelming, etc.

first game pretty good. will improve second game round when we knows it a bit better. actually, after a couple of games, i'm leaving the rating as is. I like the game, but it's not smacking with fun...it not bad...further plays have proved me wrong..this is another knizia gem that shines with 5..
UPDATE May 09. The more I play the worse (or better my opponents get) I get. It's still one of Knizia's final Big Game greats IMO.
UPDATE Dec 09. Well, I'm slowly getting better at this game. There are so many strategic avenues to pursue. I consider this to be one of the later Knizia classics. Rating up from 8 to 9. Might even make the coveted 10 rating in time.

RATING: 8
Before I started playing a more diverse set of games (wargames, silly games,  Ameritrash games, sex games - OK, maybe not the last one), Amun Re was easily in my top 10.

It's a game of remarkable restraint, in that a player who establishes a significant lead in the first half - which is often the result of fiscal irresponsibility - isn't guaranteed to maintain that lead and win in the second half.

I'm always a sucker for unique auction mechanics, too, and the must-bid-elsewhere-if-overbid mechanic was original when Amun Re was first released.  To add to the game's depth, the changing province values (based on pyramids not being washed away, etc.) and bonus scoring cards are bound to shake up players' "how much is this really worth?" bid appraisals.

The only points of complaint are that the randomly drawn bonus cards can swing games, and the game just doesn't scale well.  Playing with five is the only option for a truly competitive game.

Played a dozen of times face-to-face as well as on SBW (with 5 players). The game has some good mechanisms (auction system, Nile level), limited randomness, and interesting decisions - and it is not too long. A negative point might be the way ties are broken for sacrifices (by seating order, which is more or less random, but always go the same way). Also, I am not convinced it works nearly as well with fewer than 5 players.

Do I like this game so much because of the Gola session report, or is it really that good? Either way I love playing.

It's an economic engine game with multiple well-balanced paths to victory. It doesn't require as much arithmetic as Power Grid, and is more straightforward than Puerto Rico. The biggest drawback is that it needs exactly 5 players to be at its best. Try it on www.spielbyweb.com (play by email) to get a feel for the game.

Lots of player interaction through an original auction system, combined offerings and having to watch what others are building.

One of the best Knizia games for me. The mechanic used to bid on the land areas works wonderfully. I also think it is cool that before the 2nd part of the game, people lose their areas, and you have to bid again to get them. It makes the game tense and interesting. **Update; it didn't hit the table in 7 years so I let it go. Maybe I will regret it, if so, I will just buy it again.

Possibly my favourite Reiner Knizia game, and since I have more by him than any other designer, that's saying something. (Although that's partly because he's so prolific.)

The territories use a very interesting and different auction mechanic, and the sacrifice uses blind bidding with the twist that the total matters as well as the individual bids, and some players will want to lower that total rather than raise it.

Having only played it twice, I don't have any in-depth comments yet, but I loved it both times and hope to get playing it again soon!

The bidding game mechanic is fine as is, but the power cards unfortunately take a lot away from the game. It increases the luck factor tremendously, making it rather difficult to plan strategically. The game may also benefit from playing with money open rather than hidden. Player interaction is not high, just mainly the bidding and sacrificing phases. Downtime can be substantial. Game board is a little difficult to decipher but other game components are fine.

Really liked my first play, but we missed several rules that could have had a significant impact. Lots of nice options, but like Merchants of Amsterdam, I got a very strong feeling that the game helps the rich get richer -- if you have more money, you get to spend more on your actions to get what you need to generate more money. Fall behind that curve, either through poor decision making, poor luck of the draw from the Power Card deck or a poor farmer payout when you really need it, and it seems like you can quickly find yourself out of the game by the halfway point. I've enjoyed my subsequent plays more, but I'm not completely convinced of the game's long-term strategic replay value, despite really liking the components, mechanics and decisions (few though they seem to be).

Let's get the bad out of the way first.  I don't think I'm very fond of the card drawing luck factor, and I'm unsure if there are mechanics in the game that mitigate this (I suppose besides the numerous opportunites to procure more cards, but even that doesn't guarantee anything).  Need more plays to get a better feel for this, but besides the aforementioned dislike, I really did enjoy playing Amun-Re.

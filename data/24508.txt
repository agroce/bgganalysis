I'm really enjoying the game right now.  It has that tile laying I love, and it's just aggressive enough for me.

We mostly play this 2-player, and have started to limit the tiles to 24.  I really like this variant.

Something about this game I can't quite grasp.  I can't seem place my tiles so that my opponents can't screw me over, or somehow get set up to place the valuable buildings.  Maybe it is just too abstract for me.

RATING: 7
Tile-laying game with great components, and multiple paths to victory.  Definitely has a similar feel to Attika (same designer) while still being a completely different game.  Works well as a 2-player, decent as a 3-player, haven't tried 4 players yet.

Each turn you lay a tile, and then HAVE to build (if you can't, you automatically lose).  When you're laying tiles, you might want to spread them out, and hope to quickly build the simpler buildings (huts), or you can layer them upwards, in an effort to build the more difficult towers.  There's another type of building to build as well, that is relatively easy to build either vertically or horizontally.  If you manage to build all of 2 building types, you win.  If the game runs until the end, then you want to have built the most of the most important building, then the most of the second-most important building, etc.

There is some interesting stategy in that you can destroy other player's settlements, but in many cases, it will be more beneficial to destroy your own.  Looks like a simple game, but there's definitely some things going on, as a plus, it can be a very quick and easy to play game.

Elegant components and mechanics, which are clearly hiding some depths of strategy... but it'll take a few games to wheedle the out!

RATING: 7
I think that the high chaos abstract multiplayer games just rub me the wrong way. I felt like my actions didn't really have a clear effect on the game, which, when combined with the high chaos, just frustrated me. This felt very similar to Clans in that sense.

So far, every Merkle game I've played I haven't liked (Attika, Funny Friends, Attribut). Still want to try Meuterer and Verrater, though, which sound pretty fun.

UPDATE: Upgraded to a 7 after playing the game 2-players. It plays much much better that way, like your usual two-player abstract strategy games (only with luck in the tile draws). It's also better with three versus four, though it'd harder to win since people can work together to prevent a win.

Taluva has brought me a lot of joy since purchasing it. The rules are simple and relatively clean and easy to explain. The concept and theme are great and at the end of the game it is really quite pretty to look at. I've had no trouble getting people to try this one out.

Plays pretty fast, without loosing on strategy. It's like "fast play Java". Very nice and tough components and the way the playing area builds up in 3D is ingenious.

LIKE: Simple rules with clever playing makes this game interesting. Chunky tiles and nice bits. Small setup time.

DISLIKE: Adding volcanoes can be confusing for non-gamers. Some non-intuitive rules when expanding, but minor.

OVERALL: Needs more plays, but seems like a fun, quick game.

Juego de construcción de isla, con losetas tri-hexagonales, que se van apilando en vertical haciendo niveles por erupciones, y colocando tokens de chozas, torres y templos, quien consiga antes colocar todos los edificios de 2 categorías ganará. Cuidado que puedes eliminar completamente chozas del contrario y propias, al pisarlas colocando losetas, pudiendo separar un asentamiento en 2, pero no podrás pisarla si hay una única choza en un asentamiento. Casi abstracto, muy curioso, muy recomendable. Por lo que llevo visto, funciona mejor con 2 o 3 jugadores.

An OK game.  I'm not big on this sort of thing, though I do prefer the two player Fjords to this.  I just felt that something was lacking and I prefer to think about how you need to place each tile whereas for the first level here you can just about place them anywhere.

An excellent tile laying game. Easier to teach and play than Carc, but just as much strategy and tactics. Artwork on the (very thick) tiles is stunning. I would recommend this game over Carc as an ideal gateway game.

This has the potential to replace Carcasonne as my tile-laying game of choice.  Game board development is tight even in a two-player game so player choices are constantly interacting.  I am thrilled with how the island develops, and good play is rewarded with more interesting island configurations.  The one drawback is that explaining the rules always makes the game sound more complicated than it really is, and the objective of the game is opaque to some at first (enough to turn off a couple people) because of the seemingly random multiple win conditions.  I would not be surprised if the game designers came up with a ruleset to create an island, and the win conditions were selected during play-testing to guide interesting island development rather than thematic consistency.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fairly deep game.  Abstract in nature.  Place tiles and pieces according to the rules; try to get rid of 2 of the 3 types of pieces before anyone else.

Experienced players have a decided edge.  There's a good bit to be said for interfering with other people's plans, as well as for having back ups for your own.

I really like how this game develops.  It starts small and then balloons out to provide an increasing number of choices.  I also like how there's player interaction, but it's primarily indirect - as in interference rather than confrontation.  Also a relatively short game length.  Don't play with the AP-inclined.

A great, fun game that I strongly recommend.  Doesn't rate higher because, while strategic, the game is short.  Develops well over the course of the game, but the available options/choices are constrained and do not enable a player to pursue very [i]complex[/i] goals.  Excellent as a shorter abstract.

RATING: 7
In the distant past clans compete to build villages on a volcanic island which is constantly changing landscapes. Each turn, players place a new triangular tile to increase the size of Taluva or change the existing topography. Player's can add temples and towers and huts to the board in an attempt to score the most points. A great tactical and strategic game, easy to learn, the board is different every time which leads to no game being the same.

RATING: 7
In Carcassonne, what's on the tiles is all important and your meeples are just markers for claiming a score.  In Taluva terrain is really just a means to an end, which is creating settlements with your building pieces.  Tiles can be overlaid; indeed you will want to do that, both for the satisfaction of reducing  opponents' settlements, but also because towers can only be placed on (three-) high ground. Towers seem like the highest value buildings because they literally tower over everything and each player has just two.  In fact, it is the number of temples placed that can win the game.  I think that the geek voters are right and Taluva plays best with two.  Higher player counts bring a degree of chaos.  Taluva is a quick, thinky little neo-abstract, which is fine with me.

I own the Ferti edition, which improves the box artwork by replacing the constipated guy in a loin cloth of the HiG/Rio Grande edition.  The tiles and pieces are as beautiful as in the original.  Production quality is very good, with the tiles  nice and chunky.  The rules are clear and well set out.

Good tile placement game. The game is easy to teach and play. The components are really nice. I like the pseudo-3D effect of the island as we build it higher and higher. It takes about 30 minutes and it is suitable for both casual and experienced gamers.

RATING: 7.01
All games played 2-player only.  Rating is based on such.
Initially I dismissed this game and after the first two games. I was not impressed but I revisited it to give it a second chance.  It seemed as if there was too little to be done to stop an opponent, yet too much "take that".  My initial rating: 4After several more games I've become aware of the subtle strategies of both tile placement and settlement expansion.  The game has really proved to be very confrontational and efforts to control your opponents options must begin with tile and volcano arrangements.  Each game has increased my appreciation for this game.  I especially like the bits as well.  With a nice drawstring bag, this could be a nice portable game that is eye candy to the passerby as well.  Current rating now 6.5 and may go up further.For informational purposes; The game was initially played over lunch on sucessive days.  Two plays per.  With so little time between playings, it was easier to build on past experience to play better with each game.
Update: Played with variant using only 12 tiles per player and found the game more enjoyable.  Breaks the threshold between an OK game and a good game. Rating now 7+ after 6 games.

March 2013: A confrontational game about grabbing space to build on a rapidly changing volcanic island.  Very abstract, but also pleasant to look at.  The best move is often unclear: there are ways to commit to a long-term plan that are not immediately obvious to new players. 

With two players the number of tiles needs to be reduced: 30 feels about right if you play aggressively.

This game has a nice blend of difficulty, play length and style.  It is both an area influence and tile laying game.  Strategies are subtle and players need to keep an eye on their options and what the opponents are doing.  It plays well with 2, 3, or 4, but strategy is slightly different with each.  In this regard it plays similar to Attika (also designed by the same designer).  Likewise, there are 2 methods to win - a quick win and a long win.  Inexperienced players will see quick wins, but long wins will be the norm for experienced players.  If you like tiles and area control - this game deserves a serious look.

After a lukewarm 1st impression, I'm starting to really enjoy this little abstract. Comparisons to Java are apt due to the 3D island building and the need to cutoff settlements for tower and temple building.

Like Attika (by the same designer), I think this is really a two player game, with any more players adding a "No, you stop him" element that I find distastefully in a low-luck abstract game (again, like Attika). The 3D element is nice, and I'd like to try this with 2.

Placing here is cooler because, unlike Carcassonne, you can place tiles on top of each other and makes some cool effects.  The game is a bit too abstract for me.  It is a decent game but it is too light for me as well.  There are many other games that I would rather play.  I am glad that I played it though.  I think when I play it more I will see more of the kingmaking and would drive me absolutely nuts.

Taluva is a three-dimensional more strategic version of Carcassonne.
Compared to Carcassonne, it has a more strategic approach to tile laying: you need to "build" your chance to place the most difficult pieces during the course of several turns, during which you must disrupt other players' plays as well.

A wolf in sheep's clothing. This looks like a pretty little tile laying game and it is to some extent. It is also a fairly direct if lighter game of logical combat. A game of blocking and attacking for area control and a bit deeper than it first appears.

[i]Taluva[/i] is a new game that manages to be nostalgic.  I know that description sounds like a paradox, but when I play [i]Taluva[/i] I am reminded of other games.  The presence of volcanos and spending resources to climb higher are reminiscent of [i][gameid=54][/i].  The shape of the pieces themselves, stacking and aligning land types feels like [i][gameid=855][/i].  Growing the play area organically without a formal game board has been lifted from Merkle's own excellent game, [i][gameid=8051][/i].

The production value of this game is beyond [i][gameid=855][/i]-esque.  The tiles in [i]Taluva[/i] are [i]thicker,[/i] something I would not have thought possible.  The rules are simple if you're learning them from someone who already knows the game, otherwise they are missing a couple of small but critical clarifications.  A few pointers: any time you want to expand a settlement to a higher level, you [i]must[/i] have the prerequisite number of huts for that new level.  You can never have a single hut on a level two space, for example.  You can place a Temple (or a Tower) as the linking piece between two settlements, even if one of them already has a Temple (or a Tower, if you're placing a Tower) in it: select the [i]other[/i] Settlement as the one for which you are placing the Temple, and ignore all others.  Minus one point for these oversights, as they unnecessarily increase the learning curve.

With enough patience, the game comes together beautifully. The artwork is attractive, and a completed game looks fantastic on the table.  After a couple of learning sessions to familiarize myself with the rules, I had an "aha!" moment where they all came together.  I realized how simple the game really is.  There are plenty of opportunities for players to interfere with each other, especially since there is no penalty for playing in a different area of the board -- unlike [i][gameid=8051][/i], where a new settlement requires extra investment. The two-player game is more strategic simply because there are fewer players to get in the way.  The three-player game requires a more defensive mindset, and there can be [i][gameid=8051][/i]-like experiences where one player is forced to stop the opponent to her left.  I haven't played with four players, but I imagine that the game becomes even more chaotic.

[i]Taluva[/i] is a strong game in its own right even though you might feel as though you've played it before.  Some portions of it are recycled, but they haven't all been brought together this elegantly.  I'm looking forward to my next game.

This game is a race to get your pieces on the board. Each piece has different placement rules. So far, only huts and temples have won the game. Different strategy may bring the towers out more often.

I've taught this game to a number of people and at first this game's rules seem overwhelming.  What I've learned at least is that it's best with 2 players, especially if you are trying to play for your first time.  There are a lot of little tricks to the placement of the game-board pieces for protecting your huts that I didn't understand at first, but now I find myself watching my opponent's strategy to see whether I want to crush them or just help my own settlements. There is a deep feeling of satisfaction that comes with crushing your opponents' pieces to be sure, but you always have to keep in mind the game objective is to get rid of 2 sets of your pieces not only to smash!

When reading the rules, I thought it must surely be a quite simple game and not too strategic. Now, after playing it a few times with different people, I am surprised about the cleverness and complexity of the game. There is so much to think when placing a tile and where to put huts, temples and watchtowers. You always need to watch your co-players and anticipate their next move in order not to fall behind.

An abstract game with a South Pacific theme pasted on. It works well with two, three, and four players, though we play with the rule that you have 12 tiles per player. Reducing the number of tiles when there are fewer than four players prevents all the games from ending in a premature victory.

[A friend gave me his copy.]
This game really surprised and impressed me. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Having just played Java (another 3D game), I wasn't looking forward to it that much (I like Java, but I wouldn't want to play it every week). But Taluva has a very different feel while retaining that cool aspect of building out and up to create an awesome-looking board by the end. Unlike Java, the game goes very quickly, because players don't get stuck trying to calculate out seventeen different possibilities. You only get two moves--place a tile and place a wooden piece--so there are fewer choices. I also liked that even with four players, it was still slightly strategic. True, several times someone took the spot that I was gonna place my piece in, but I was able to grab and build up a couple of areas before someone else interfered. With four players, Java is pretty much just tactical. With instruction, Taluva took 30 minutes, and I was totally ready to play again as soon as it ended. It's an excellent, quick-playing, meaty filler. I expect that my rating will increase from the initial 8 after repeated plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Beautifully elegant and works great with 2 or 3, perhaps a little chaotic with 4
The key rule is that if you can't build, you lose, which constrains your other building options elegantly and makes for a tense battle that often leaves all players within a move or so of winning at the end. Three player is great since effective  ganging up on the leader needs intelligent cooperation between the other parties, neatly avoiding the Attika "It's your problem" issues.
And afterward; a game where you can stand back and admire the visual glory of the finished board.
UPDATE: Increased rating to 9, still finding more neat twists. Strategic placement of the tiles to set up or prevent village self-destruction keeps the game endlessly fascinating. The more we play, the more often towers take on a role since the fast temples-and-huts win gets blocked. Often see wins with forks these days, you can block my last temple but only by giving me space to build my last tower....

A bit abstract -- the game is virtually randomness- and luck-free -- but neat, and really, really quick.  It fits a similar niche as Hey! That's My Fish!, but this is more beautiful and has much less setup time.  (Not as good, in my opinion, though.)  My wife doesn't like it, because it's hard to see a good move on your turn.  It's not a casual game, at least with 2 players.

It is a racing game of sorts, in which you're trying to make each move as efficient as possible.  Games will usually be [i]very[/i] close.

I've played with 2, 3 and 4.  Some people think it is an excellent two-player game, but I prefer it with more, definitely.

Recently, I have begun to put much more emphasis on the designer of a game, because much experience has shown that certain designers either make games that appeal to me or for whatever reason hold a better grasp of what makes a good game.  With respect to Merkle, I remained dubious before playing Taluva.  Verrater and Meuterer rank high amongst the games where my opinion differs vastly from that of the BGG populace.  These two games suck.  However, despite some minor blemishes I really do adore Attika.

Well, Taluva is not only Merkle's best game, but a great game by any standard.  I would put it up as the epitome of German design goals as it packs a lot of game into very simple rules and a very short duration.  Amazingly, the game boasts very strong tactical tile placement and a bit of strategy in deciding which buildings to puruse.  Also, due to some smart design decisions, it avoids the usual problem of analysis paralysis usually associated with tile-laying games of this type.  Yet for all its excellence in game design, it doesn't neglect more visceral "fun" elements such as crushing people's huts with a volcano.

Highly recommended to everyone.

Plays a bit like a more competitive, three-dimensional version of Carcassonne.  Not bad, but we end of picking the former more during game nights.

Taluva reminds me of Carcassonne (its rules are very simple: lay a tile, place a meeple/building), with more interaction: there are many opportunities to mess with your opponents' plans.

Taluva has cool bits, and is a nice, simple strategy game.  That is, a little too simple.  We could wiz through a round in 10 minutes.  It's not the type of game I'd want to play many times in one sitting, so setting it up for such a limited amount of play seemed pointless.  The game isn't terribly deep, so it often felt like a race more than a punch-counterpunch duel.  Sold it.

Nice abstract tile layer. The rules are simple but the  rulebook is awful, so after a bad start and a few queries on BGG we had to scrap our first game and start over. Once we got the hang of it, it started to get a puzzly feel in the way that many abstracts have. You spend much of your turn thinking about where to place, trying to make tile configurations that your opponent cannot break up while also fulfilling one of the victory conditions. Bumping people's huts doesn't hurt them nearly as much as you might think it does, and you can quickly dig yourself into a hole if you use up too many of your own huts. A lot of room for growth and mastery.

A (totally awesome) gift from my 2012 BGG Secret Santa.  Getting an expensive, out-of-print game is really going above and beyond the call.

This is probably my favorite 2-player abstract.  The tile draw provides just enough randomness that you don't feel compelled to plan too far ahead, but not so much that you feel it determines the game.  It's simple to teach and quick to play, while offering plenty of strategic decisions.  And it looks super cool.  What more could you want?

The box says it plays with 2-4, but I think of it exclusively as a 2-player game.  With more players, it's too chaotic.

Just got this game recently. So far only a few 2 player plays, 1 with 3 and 1 with 4. I'm still trying to figure out the strategies in this game. It seems somewhat chaotic to me at this point. It seems to be more fun with more players but possibly less chaotic with less. The placement rules are difficult to teach and remember. Possibly the best part is how esthetically pleasing the board looks while your playing. Hope to play some more.

An excellent family game! There is quite a bit of room for messing with your opponents, but the spirit of the game is not as mean as in some other games of this type. Take notice when someone else is about to build a temple and try to stop it with clever tile or hut placement. That is, unless you immediately need to set yourself up to build your own temple. In that case, let some other player take care of it! Also, watch where you place your tiles, because you might be able to use a volcano placement to split a settlement into two parts to prepare to add another temple. When playing defensively, it's most important to concentrate on the player who goes immediately after you, because no one else will have a chance to limit their effectiveness. Conversely, if you are currently playing for your own gain, expanding settlements, try to not leave the player immediately after you with a really advantageous opportunity.

Nice big chunky tiles (are they the thickest ever?) and a clear game structure don't quite disguise the essentially abstract nature of the game but do hide it well enough for me to enjoy it.  It also plays very quickly for what is a solid light middle-weight, which is a nice bonus.

RATING: 9
This has grown on me with repeated play. It's beautiful once set up, it's simple, it's got some interesting tactics. It's a bit of a trashing game, in that you have plenty of opportunity to slow down and interfere with your opponents, but the trashing is subtle enough, and requires enough cooperation, that it doesn't seem to suffer as horribly as the designer's previous game, Attika, in which keeping the player on your left from winning was an overriding objective in the game. Here, you're trading off the need to get ahead with the need to cooperate with other players to slow down a leader in much more interesting ways.

I think the game is simple and clever enough that the tremendously well-done presentation and decent theme for this category of games kicks it up to an 9 for me, and it's almost certainly a keeper.

Almost no randomness.
Seems awesome from 2 to 4
More chaotic with 4 but still fun. 

After a while, I start seeing that most game end via tower/huts. Easier than temples, and very hard to stop.

It's a bit cold an unintuitive for new players, but so beautiful

[u]September 2008:[/u] Gorgeous game, nice to play, a great filler I wanted, a great filler I got. Not that intense, but very smooth to play.

[u]Nov 2008:[/u] After a play with my dad (not a big player, prefers abstracts): seemed to think it was a bit complicated, then again, it was late and we had a bit too much to drink at dinner.
My first 3p game: liked it a lot too, but I prefer the 2p game.

[u]May 2009:[/u] After my last play, I realized I didn't like the game that much. However, the beauty of the pieces makes up for it and is the real enjoyment here. Without the beautiful parts, I'd say this game is a 5.5.

RATING: 9
Wow - what an excellent and unique game this is! Never played anything like it, and the first time I played it, we played it 3 times in a row which is very unusual for my group! I have played it quite a lot compared to many other games. However, somehow it seems that people are torn between this game; some love it, others really don't care for it. I'm definitely in the first group.

Regarding the strategy, I need to say that it does seem that it's easier to win by placing and getting rid of your towers and huts compared to the temples, but that might just be because of how we play it. Also, I mainly play Taluva with 3 players total, so the tiles don't deplete and we always end up winning in the premature way. With 4 players, the stack of tiles might run out, and then the winner is determined on the number of temples, so temples are much more important with 4 players! In order to make it a more tense game for 2-3 players, you can remove some of the tiles so you can run out of tiles and find a winner under the normal victory conditions, and I guess the towers aren't the best then. We like to keep all of the tiles in our game, though, so towers win most of the times. Only a few times have I seen a game being won by placing all your temples and towers, but it's very rare.

Also, it's a pretty big advantage to be the starting player as the game can be over immediately when a player only has one type of buildings left; if you start, you kind of have an extra turn as you're closer to getting rid of your buildings, and I've seen in a few of my games that other players could win in the same turn as the starting player did, so that's a little imbalanced. 

Still, it's a great, fast and tactical game and is a good choice to play for both new players and true gamers as a light "filler" which can be played in 20 minutes if you know the game - we are actually finishing most of our 3p games in 15 minutes, sometimes even less.

Taluva is gorgeous to look at when you are done, and I really recommend this game! The only downside of this game is that it's OOP at the moment, but if you can find one, even if it's expensive, buy it!

RATING: 7
Let's start this with an "8" rating, though it might go up or down with more plays. It's hard not to compare/contrast this with Carcassonne. Carcassonne is light, random, simple, and playful (unless you really play cutthroat). Taluva is tactical, thinky, and a bit obtuse. There's some complexity in remembering the restrictions to each building type, and the pros and cons regarding where to play tiles is not immediately obvious. But unlike Carcassonne, there's a lot going on here and it offers greater depth.

One thing for sure, the game looks gorgeous as you lay tiles, stack them up, and create an island.

Update: surprisingly, I traded this game away. It's a good game, and looks gorgeous on the table. It's just a tad too abstract and simply wasn't getting played with any real frequency. Given the fact it is not widely available, I figured it was good trade bait.

First impressions after one play is that there is an interesting - and very mean - little game here, but it is likely too tactical for my tastes.

What a pleasant surprise. This game has a unique feel and has been extremely well-received by all the local players I know who've played it.

Firstly, I love the physical components. Very Java-like tiles, nice and thick. 

I also like that there is no scoring or VPs to calculate. There are simply winning conditions. Also, per the rules, you can be a "premature winner". That kicks ass!

The rules are straightforward, but the decision-making is rich. Also, this game doesn't FEEL like its obviously derivative of any other game. It has its  own unique niche.

The weak point would be that it has the Puerto Rico syndrome...where a weak player can unintentionally throw the game to the player after him/her in turn order. There is not mechanism to mitigate that phenomenon. But with players of comparable strength, its a good contest.

I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

When I win a game, I like to feel like it was because I had a good strategy, I was really lucky, or a combination of both.  In my first game of TALUVA, I won and I had absolutely no grasp of strategy, placement tactics, and I was hazy on one or two of the critical rules.  Talk about unsatisfying.  TALUVA is a reasonable abstract game without a lick of theme despite a handsome production that plays sort of like JAVA stripped of A LOT of fat and without those stupid, pointless festivals. As a simple, tile-laying/placement game TALUVA is moderately successful as long as it doesn't break the 30 minute time barrier.  There are a few opportunities for destructive, confrontational play that can swing the game one way or another but mostly it's a pretty light affair.  I don't hate the game, but I don't feel terribly compelled to play it again either.  Fans of ATTIKA, JAVA, FJORDS, and those types of games will probably get at least a couple of games out of it before the realization of the game's shallowness and repetition sets in.

It took me a while to rate this but a recent double-play of three then four helped me decide what I thought. It can seem a little lopsided, especially with mixed abilities/experience, but once players learn what to watch out for it becomes nicely taught and competitive.

I much prefer it with three as with four it's a little too chaotic. With three you can't let things go in the same way and every turn is a tension between having to block/frustrate one of your opponents and attempting to build your own base. It feels like one of those games that get better the better you and your opponents get.

Probably a better game than my uninspiring first experience conveyed. It didn't seem like there was enough that could be done to prevent an opponent from going out by using all temples and huts...unless the rule about squashed huts being removed from the game was wrong and they were supposed to be returned to the player it seems unlikely that there is often any point in building towers.

RATING: 7
Fun tile-laying game with beautiful bits which add considerably to the game. The fact that you can grow your little island upwards gives it extra appeal. However, I'm not so sure yet about the game play. Originally I envisioned something of a Rat Hot, which can become really, really mean at times. Taluva is far tamer than that, as huts already placed already count for you. The only way to hinder someone then is by cutting short the size of their settlements so they can't build temples. But as I haven't seen a victory by placing all tiles, I fear the temples are rather redundant to begin with, and are just useful to threaten with. As it is, there isn't much 'game' in there.

I think I'm going to fiddle with house rules in order to emphasize nasty play. The game's rating is an undeserved 6, and should go up to a 7 once I'm done with it.

[b]Update[/b] As it turned out, the simplest way of fixing matters is also the way present in later editions of the game: simply remove a number of tiles prior to play. I'm not sure I agree with the 12 tiles per player-formula in those later editions; this seems to curtail the other victory condition too much because play turns a lot more agressive. I'm going for a 14-13-12 variant for 2-3-4 players respectively. Upped the rate too.

What a delightfully simple and elegant game.  This was easy to learn, and the complexity of strategy revealed itself quickly so I could see plenty of replay potential.

The board builds out and up with thick chunky tiles as players try to expand their settlements with huts, and set up a good arrangement to add temples (for expanding outward) or towers (for expanding upward).  Blocking and destroying your opponents settlements are key to victory.

Beautifully made, plays fast, and works perfectly for 2 players.  Really glad to have this added to my collection.

Production: Hefty tiles with attractive artwork.  Nice wooden bits.  Play: This plays fairly quickly.  It is difficult to know whether I am exhausting my huts at a good pace.  It is interesting trying to keep the tiles bunched together, to make it easier to increase their level, but keep my settlements spread apart, to make them easier to separate.  I can't get my brain around the strategy, though.  I find it very difficult to even get a single non-hut on the board. (2 0 2) (2 plays)

Not a bad abstract -- tile-laying mixed with building placement, almost a la Carcassonne -- but with so many more interesting games to play and re-play, I have little incentive to retry this one. A game like Kingdom Builder which has come out in the meantime has much greater interest to me, more variety and complexity, just as attractive and more fun to play.

Extremely robust and simple mechanics which result in deep and varied gameplay = good game design.

"A poor man's Java." That was my first reaction after playing it at the Spellenspektakel 2006. That sounds condescending, but I don't mean it in a bad way, it is still a solid game and it looks gorgeous.

I can't put my finger on the sore spot, but the game felt a bit limited in choices to me. I didn't have that "wish I had two turns now" feeling like I have in Java. Less screwage, less analysis. I'm sure some people will prefer Taluva for exactly those reasons. And yes, it plays as fast as stated.

A filler that runs much more deeper than it seems.

This game has an abstract nature that is very well masked by the skin provided by the theme. Beeing so, the game has an appeal, as there are just a bunch of simple rules to follow but capable of demand some strategic thinking, as the interaction and competition between players is high.
The 3D ideia is very nice, the game is visualy very rewarding and it is usually over in less than an hour, even there is some room for AP.

Interesting tile builder where the victory condition is who can build the more glorious village on a constantly erupting island. I liked that the game end is triggered by the players and not some random timer. Victory is also simple - it's about how many village pieces you place. Can be very cutthroat where you take a move simply to prevent or harm an opponent. Quick at 30 minutes I'd play this one again.

I was not convinced on initial plays, but this game lives up to the hype. Gameplay is deep and the variability between games is surprisingly large given that I'm playing all 2p games against the same opponent. The components are beautiful and create a very pleasing tableau as the game goes on. It's really a shame this game is still hard to come by.

RATING: 7.5
With it's take a tile, place a tile, place a marker (a settlement in this case, rather than a worker) mechanism, the comparison to Carcassonne is inevitable. However, I do think that Taluva occupies a different niche: it's quicker and less involved than Carcassonne  but for a half hour game it is very involving and the two possible end / victory conditions (which in the games I've played come up roughly equally often) make for some interesting tactical choices.

Also, in terms of visuals and tactility - it's one of the finest games I've played.

Perfect as a quick filler or as an introduction for new gamers.

2006-10-20: Played it twice at the spiel. One two- and one three-player game. Seems to be a nice, kind of abstract game where you try to either build more temples than your enemy or you go for a quick victory by building two out of three building-types. Good thing about it is that you can really screw the other players plans. Plays quite quick. Will surely try it again in the future.

Nicely presented tile laying and placement game.  Players on their turn draw and place a landscape tile, which can expand an ever growing island laterally, or start growing volcanoes vertically.  After placing a tile, the player takes one of four building placement options - placing huts, temples or towers.  The game is over when all tiles are used up, or when one player has completely placed two or their three types of pieces.  The game is fine, simple to pick up and play, but super bland.  Good for a few plays before trading it on.

What a great, neat little game.  The pieces are gorgeous, and the mechanics are quite interesting.  It's definitely an abstract strategy game though, don't expect much theme.  I really like the way the board develops over time, and the mechanics are simple to learn, but offer a fair bit of depth.  I felt as I played my first game, new insights were gradually coming to me in how I could better position my pieces.  Also, I love that the ending can be triggered in different ways, which can sometimes sneak up on you, and can reward smart tactical play with a nice surprise victory.  Looking forward to future plays.

Decent game - at the same time expansive and limiting. After several turns it seemed like my moves were dictated more by my opponents than myself...some people might call that "interaction". I think the most strategic moves happen early in the game - removing pieces, blocking unfavorable "eruptions" - after, you just sort of play it out and do the best you can. Also, winning player was first player, and won the same turn I would have. Maybe I wasn't aggressive enough? but he was aggressive and I still would have gone out *shrug*. Not crazy about it.

Drop down some hot lava fiery death on your opponents while positioning your settlements to avoid the same fate. An attractive game, although I can't help but wish the tiles were bigger.  Gameplay-wise, feels like any number of other tile-laying games: advance your own victory conditions while simultaneously trying to foil the plans of your opponents. A decent contribution to the genre.

UPDATE: Played a couple of competitive games recently. Multiple routes to victory more apparent. Strategy deeper than first realized. Ratings upgrade.

Taluva is a good tile laying game with a lot of player interaction.  I feel that it will scale well regardless of the number of players but more than two will add some chaos to the game.  I consider it to be a good gateway game because there aren't a lot of rules and the play time is short to allow for multiple games.  I think Attika is the more popular game by this designer but I prefer this one because the game feels less random.

A beautiful game in terms of presentation and game material. Building the ever-growing mountain world works great and allows for many interesting placement decisions (as well as looking really great). The rules are simple and quickly explained. Where the game falls down a little for me is that it inevitably runs down to a kingmaking finale if played with equally competent players. In our game it ran down to this: Player A couldn't win anymore, but could prevent player B from winning, which he did. Player B could now not win either, but could make a decision that either could make player C or player D win. It lies in the nature of this game that situations like this WILL occur, and one thinks if there couldn't have been some other design decisions to prevent this. With part-time gamers this problem won't be as evident, though, and this game will certainly be enjoyed if played in a family setting, as it isn't too difficult to grasp.

[6 plays] I think my judgment on Taluva is that I don't like it because I don't enjoy the experience of playing; I don't like the way the game makes me feel. Even when I won, which I sometimes did, I didn't enjoy it. 

We played, as often in Carcassonne, with drawing a tile at the end of your turn, so that you have until your turn comes around again to think about where to put it. Whatever plan you come up with, though, will inevitably be blighted by some action taken by another player. If it doesn't happen till the person right before you, then you will be sitting there taking time to re-plan. Or you can make multiple plans--I'll do this, or if this gets blocked I'll do that, or if this and that both get blocked I'll do something else--but it doesn't help much; either they all get blocked, or there's such a multiplicity of them in your head that you can no longer recall which was your favorite. 

In addition to "I was going to go here and start this great thing, but he blocked it," there's also a lot of "I started to build this thing, but couldn't finish it before someone interfered with me." So it's a constant cycle, or rather a plethora of constantly overlapping cycles, of having your plans crushed and thwarted. And you have to watch this play out in relatively slow motion.

After Santa Cruz had the distinction of becoming the first game in my little 'collection' to be rated a 10, I decided to check out the designer's other works. After all, such a brilliant game must have an amazing designer who has developed OTHER brilliant games right? Taluva stood out to me [the artwork and production quality is excellent] and after a year of seeing if I could find it and being unsuccessful, I ended up ordering it from Italy. I needn't have bothered. It is something that just passes the time. Maybe it's better with more players? I am not usually bored by games because I love the game-playing experience, but this one really was boring. No tension, no excitement, nothing particularly interesting happened...no thanks!

Gorgeous components, and pretty simple rules.  There are many subtleties to the design that are easy to forget -- you can only start a new settlement at ground level, for example, which (intentionally) greatly limits your ability to block opponents going for towers if you're not already in the neighborhood.  The tile draw *usually* doesn't matter, but sometimes helps or hinders your ability to expand settlements.

I like tile placement games becasue the randomness of the board makes games different and one has to "think on one's feet".  It does bring with it though the problem of "luck of the tile draw" and the analysis paralysis problems of some people (so I will watch who I am prepared to play this with).  It is supposed to be 45 mins of fun (and is with the right people) but with the wrong people can easily become 90 mins of purgatory, hence my medium rating.

Quick simple streamlined rules in this one, tiles are wonderfully thick and chunky and gameplay is pretty good too.

It is a little dissappointing however that to determine the winner we had to go right down the list of tie breakers, sort of felt anticlimactic. :(

Very quick and I made some poor choices initially until I grasped what was going on. Not sure how competitive Taluva really is but I'm keen to get a copy and play it some more. ***  Got my copy and really enjoyed the game. Paul and I kept fighting, so Mike had an easy win. It shares this with the designer's Attika, you've got to co-operate to keep others from winning. I enjoyed the tile building much more than in Java, and I found the need to some huts in reserve so you don't get eliminated to be a tight restraint. A nice balance of build or block, a quick game, good fun, well worth getting.

RATING: 4
Played 2 times with 2 and 3 players.

JAN 2012: I have been trying to trade for a copy of this for 3 years. I owned Java (twice) but heard so much about Taluva being similar (and shorter) that when Java went up in value, I thought I'd get rid of Java and acquire Taluva. Good thing I played it first. As abstractish as Java is, Taluva is much, much more abstract. And the parts of Java it gets rid of are parts that I like (except festivals - I hated festivals). So now I have neither, which is probably for the best: as good as Java is, it doesn't seem to go over well with anyone I teach it too. 

JUN 2014: My opinion two years later is the same, but worse. Taluva is SO dry and simple. It's missing the story arc that Java provides, but the reduction in time isn't worth the trade-off for me. Downgrading from 6 to 5.

Volcanoes and huts make great neighbors in this tile-laying, building construction game.  The beautiful components come up and get buried as the changing landscape moves the game along quite nicely.

RATING: 8
Almost without fail, the first time someone plays this they have no idea what the goal is, or where there's any place to even begin to develop a strategy, so I can see where some reviewers are coming from thinking it's pointless or overly abstract.

That being said, after the first game, once you have the game mechanics down and you can realize how they factor into the progression of the game and how you can use them against your opponents things get fun I think. A strategy will start to develop; I'm not going to lie and say this is the most thought-provoking game in the world, so it may be a pretty simple strategy, but there is strategy in this game. Utilizing different terrain types, planning the landscape to use different building types, blocking opponents moves, etc.

In relative terms, compared to the greats this is probably more like a 6.5 or 7, but I bump it up to 8 because it's: casual, fun, really nice to look at, a great two player game, and got a high replayablity factor.

Initial rating: 9 I love this with all players.  I don't agree that it's /too/ chaotic with 3 and 4 players.      The game scales well from 2-4.  The decisions are equally difficult no matter the number of players but it changes character depending how many you have.   So with more players the more skilled player will usually win, it's just not assured which makes it a bit better to play with people of different skill levels. It's darn good looking, too.  It's everything I love about the tangible nature of boardgaming.

15+ plays: 7.5 I enjoy the game a lot, but it's probably because it's short.  Each game starts to feel the same after a while.

The tile stacking mechanism feels different than in other similar games. It works really well. The rest of the game is interesting and the winning conditions makes it possible to go for various strategies. An impressive feat is that every ending condition seems to occur almost simultaneously (update: this is only true for a 4 player game, unfortunately with less player, the sudden death is almost the only way to win). The minor drawback is that, as they are, the rule favor the first players a little bit too much since a game can end prematurely, giving one extra move to some players. This can easily be corrected with an home-made variant though (ie. complete the current turn...)

Egyelőre csak magam ellen próbáltam, de nagyon tetszett elsőre. Tipikusan olyan játék, ami tetszik, de szinte tuti, hogy sose leszek jó benne, mert túl absztrakt nekem.
Nagyon egyszerűek és  frappánsak a szabályok. Bárkinek meg lehet 5 perc alatt tanítani, mégis komoly fejvakargatást okozhat egy-egy lépés. Két dolog nagyon tetszik benne, mindkettőnek hasonló hatása:
1. Nagy dilemma, hogy ha szeretnél valakit jól felülépíteni, akkor előtte terjeszkedni kell körülötte, amivel neki csinálsz helyet. Ugyanez igaz arra is, hogy ha te szeretnél terjeszkedni, akkor azzal megteremted a lehetőséget másnak arra, hogy felülépítsen.
2. Ahogy egyre közeledik valaki az idő előtti győzelemhez, úgy nő meg annak az esélye, hogy teljesen beszoruljon, és azonnal kiessen a játékból. 
Szóval mindkét dolog állandó dilemmát okoz, ami már-már fájdalmas tud lenni.

Kíváncsi vagyok az első éles játékok után mi lesz a véleményem.

Két és három személlyel is nagyon jól működik (biztos 4-gyel is).

Zseniális ez a játék. Pofon egyszerűek a szabályok, mégis minden mindennel összefügg benne. Igazából nem is hiszem, hogy a készítő mindezt előre tudta mikor megalkotta, szerintem ő is csak utólag, tesztelés során konstatálta mindezt.
Csak azért nem adok 10-est, mert érzem teljes értékű társasjátéknak, mivel annyira egyszerű, absztrakt.

RATING: 5
If you want to compare Taluva to other games, Java is likely the obvious choice simply because of the three-dimensional hex playing field. If you go beyond the (great) looks, however, it feels much closer to Carcassonne, albeit quite a bit more abstract.

While the game does have opportunities for clever tactical play, winning or losing seems to depend a lot on how much the other players are willing to invest in destructive play. And that's not a good thing, in most cases.

Taluva is definitely one of the stranger tile-placement games I've played.  The rules are simple, and yet strategies aren't revealed until you play a couple of times.  After that, the subtlety of the game comes through, and you begin to see that your move might have more repercussions than believed.  Taluva is quick to play (it feels like a race, somewhat) and there is always motivation to play another time.  Apart from play, the components are beautiful.  The wood is artistically designed, and the tiles are the thickest you'll ever see in a game.
It is perfect for 2 players as well.  Excellent!

Beautiful game! We really enjoy this game. The carcassonne like feeling added to the vertical stack mechanic makes for a fun and tense game. It is really nothing like carcassonne but I can see it will be unfairly compared to it. Both games are great but are really different. The components of this game are excellent! Thickest tiles I've seen. Wood bits are very well made. This one will hit the table often for a long time to come. Very easy to teach to anyone as well! It can be played in a friendly "just build your settlements and I'll build mine" mode or in a cutthroat "volcanoes destroy your settlement!" mode.

Based on 3 2-player games, and 1 3-player game, all using the "12 tiles per player" variant.

With two players this game is brilliant.  Lots of strategy, but extremely quick to play.  And the art is nice to look at as well.

Three players wasn't quite as good.  There was a bit of king-making in our game at the end.  I still enjoyed it, but 2 seems like the sweet spot.

Taluva is a very pretty game - nice artwork and stylish pieces.  It also plays well for a strategic game.  As two player there isn't too much that is random about it, but still has many options to try and forward your cause (getting the most temples, or other instant victory conditions).  I'm looking forward to trying this with several different approaches.  The ability to stomp out some of the other players' troops with a volcano makes you feel good, even if you're not doing so well on the game-end conditions.  Quite a good thinking game.

It's a beautiful and quick playing abstract/tile-laying hybrid with a lot of interaction. The randomness of the tiles is the only thing that prevents this from being a pure abstract but as I don't usually like abstracts, I like that randomness. The rotation and placement of the tiles end up mattering more anyway. The tiles are beautifully illustrated and the 3D landscape that you end up with in the end is wonderful.

The gameplay has very simple rules, but there's plenty of opportunity for smart plays and counterplays. The 2 player game feels like a power struggle and it works very well. It can be hard to grok the 3D and volcanos and it can be cruel at times, but still a lot if fun!

Played this immediately after Santorini twice now, and it just feels more interesting.  Maybe it's because it's more open ended and feels more strategic.

I'm reserving judgement on Taluva.  My first two plays (both two-player) were fun, but I think the game may ultimately be too shallow for repeated play.  Is it possible to reliably defend against what your opponent is doing?  Are there different strategies that are viable?  Is the first-player advantage too severe?  Is the game decided by luck of the draw?  All these questions are gnawing at me.  Maybe they'll all be answered in Taluva's favor . . . but I wouldn't bet on it.

Very chess like. I have to admit that I get tired playing games where I must think 4-5 moves ahead in order to play well. You have to keep a constant watch over the board so that you will: 
     1) see and be able to stop your opponent's obviously good moves (sometimes this means seeing 2-3 steps ahead, because it is very easy to notice an opponents play after it is too late to stop it)
     2) not make a play that will help your opponent as much or more than you. These types of plays are very easy as your opponent can make just as much use of your tile placements as you. 
This is definitely a game where even the most basic strategy will likely ellude you until you have a handful of games under your belt. Has hit the trade list in search of a game that will see more plays.

nice wood bits, pretty tiles, interesting but not combersome mechanics.  Probably a good addition to anyone's collection who likes games like Carcassonne.  This has a little more "take that" in it.

Taluva is the creation of Marcel-Andre Casasola Merkle, designer of such games as Attika, Meuterer and Verrater.  It is essentially a tile-laying game, but tiles can be stacked, creating a landscape that expands both horizontally and vertically.  The challenge is creating and noticing placement opportunities that will allow for the placement of huts, towers and temples.  

The game does require a certain amount of visualization skills, as players must be able to discern favorable placement opportunities and work towards long-term goals.  These plans can be upset by one’s opponents, but part of the challenge is in overcoming these obstacles.  In these respects, Taulva reminds me a bit of a simplified version of Java, one of Wolfgang Kramer’s excellent designs.  It is easier to play than Java, but it still requires considerable skill and foresight to play well.

Taluva packs quite a bit of skill, tension and strategy in less than an hour of playing time, and seems to play equally as well with three or four players.  Games develop differently each time I’ve played, which keeps it fresh and challenging.  While the game is accessible to all skill levels, experience counts, and it truly shines when played with a group of seasoned players.

RATING: 9.5
Excellent game, with simple, elegant and streamlined rules. It does borrow a lot from "Java" (which I also enjoy very much), but it's much faster and more family-friendly, still keeping good tactical depth. It's equally important to position tiles and your pieces. Likewise, hindering other players is as important as improving your position. Two-player games can (or must) be very confrontational. I can see the potential for kingmaking with more players, but otherwise it scales very well and is an almost perfect design. Being very beautiful doesn't hurt, of course.

some good tactical play in a 30 minute game.  blends elements of carc, t&e, java, and gheos but probably more like java than anything else. draw a tile, play a tile, play one of three types of game pieces (a la 'follower').  tiles are like java tiles, and height plays a role in one of the rules, but not as important as in java.  similar weight somewhere between gheos and java, but closer to gheos.

Another hidden gem as far as I am concerned. Have only played a couple of times. Not sure why I have not recorded the plays here, but they were 3 player I think, maybe 4.Its a bit of a race against time as there are not enough tiles to pursue too many different scoring angles. Got to pick something and stick to it.Otherwise you might find yourself left behind.

This game was recommended to me in a forum thread where I asked for games with deep interesting strategy that played in less than an hour.  Several of the games from that thread I have tried were duds - Taluva most definitely is not!  This fast playing abstract has beautiful pieces, and a number of tense decision points.  Your opponents are trying to get rid of their pieces and trying to screw each other at the same time.  You aren't just trying to drop as many pieces as possible though, you are trying to set yourself up for success in future turns while limiting your opponent's success through your choices.  Its fast and deep.  The downside is its themeless and can cause some analysis paralysis as people consider what everyone else might do.  This is Carcasonne for people who aren't handicapped.  Its totally abstract, but a very deep and interesting game!

Quick-playing, beautiful-looking little game with interesting victory (and defeat) conditions.  Works best with two players.  With more than that you have kingmaker issues and Attika-like "obligated moves" such as: "I have to play here or else my left-hand opponent will win."

The theme is quite thin but works well with the bits; it was clearly pasted on, but is a good choice.
So the game is a multiple player abstract, much like Attika or Magna Grecia.
It works perfectly: the comparison with Attika holds quite well, it sports simple rules, needs thinking and luck, though less so. If you hated Attika because the theme was pasted on, you won't like this neither. It is certainly a bit on the cold side, but is aesthetically pleasing and quite challenging.

This is a beautiful abstract game that plays in 3 dimensions. I can't remember what I traded this away for, but I regret it.

Update (August 2014): Played it again a few years after having traded it away. I still think that the game is absolutely stunning, simple, and quite quirky and clever. It certainly isn't the most intuitive game, but that makes it somewhat interesting. By this, I mean that the way in which the game plays out is not so transparent, causal, and tactically separable (e.g. a move that immediately hurts your opponent might be beneficial to them in the long run or moves that benefit you might not only benefit you). This adds a particular flair to the game in the same way that a game like TZAAR might -- it's not clear what the best, or even what a good move might immediately be, and that is, in my opinion, part of the mystique of this game.

Update (november 2014): I recently acquired a second copy of Taluva. This, when playing 2 players, allows for the possibility of not only double or triple Taluva, but QUADRUPLE Taluva. This turns a largely tactical game into a largely tactical game with a larger strategic horizon (which is a welcome change). Not to mention that the large resultant island is absolutely gorgeous and far more diverse from game to game. Upgrading rating from 7 to 8.

This was a very interesting game which I would like to play more.  The tension between using all your pieces to end the game early and getting stuck with no legal play seems to be the area of the game with the most space for exploration.  That should be good for maybe 5 games, and maybe I will find more to enjoy (other than the beautiful island that gets built)

Very easy rules yet deep strategy. You are building up slowly, piece by piece but your opponents sometimes have a chance to destroy you. It was confusing at first but to the second game it cleared noticeably. The artwork is outstanding however the game could have get a better theme.

Pros:
-Easy rules, yet deep strategy.
-You have a chance to destroy your enemies villages, that i love.
-Eye catching artwork, is always a big plus.
-It has a big replay value.

Cons:
-Can be confusing at first.
-A bit expensive for what it is.
-Because this is an abstract game, the theme is lacking.

Taluva is a solid, appealing abstract with beautiful pieces that have the look and feel of quality.

It's a very nice, quick-playing game with a tropical island theme, and supports up to four players.

The game is played on a three-dimensional island, built of extra-heavy three-hex star tiles by the players during their play. Each depicts a volcano, plus two other island terrains, sometimes matching but more often not.

Each turn players take and place a tile, then play one or more buildings onto the board.  The tiles can be piled, by putting the volcano portion of the tile on top of another, but in a different orientation, so tiles are completely supported but do not pile directly atop each other.

Because of the random tile pull/play, the board is basically unique every play, and the 3D effect can be very interesting for strategy.

Players try to run out of two sets of buildings; however, if they cannot play a building legally, then they are out of the game entirely.

Of course the timing and pre-planning of placements can be thrown off somewhat by the random tile draw, or by opponents' moves, which keeps the game fresh.

I've rated this a 7, but I am tempted to increase it, because I think it's really a very good game, and the board builds to an attractive and beautiful structure, with the wooden buildings and the piled volcanos.

This was out of print for several years, but like Merkle's game Attika this is a really terrific themed abstract, and I'm glad to see it available again for others to enjoy.

Good game, I had a very good time during first game!
Feels like it is a little "chess-y" in the sense that I expect experienced player to really get an edgz on new ones because they can read the board better, and would learn a few "patterns to win". And that's both good (game durability) and bad (adaptation to new players), thus the rating.

Fascinating variant of the Carcassone mechanic of 1) draw a tile, 2) play it, and 3) play your meeples. Except in this one, the tiles are tri-hexagonal, and tiles can be placed to bury your opponents in lava! The only problem is that the early part of the game is trying to determine the best course of play, as there is no way to foresee the future; you just react to the tile you just drew, trying to maximize the benefits. Still, the components are gorgeous, with the super-thick tiles a pleasure to play, and stack, sort of like in Java (which I wish I could find a copy of). Seems fairly random, but eventually, long-term plays can be setup with deliberate tile placement. All in all a fun, fast, simple game, that belittles the deep tactical and strategic play that lies beneath its pretty exterior.

Update (10/31/09) 4 plays: Played this twice in rapid succession one evening. I'm still befuddled by the lack of any long-term strategy that is apparent; the game is mostly multi-player solitaire, with some interaction of the "you screw me, I screw you" variety. It is also somewhat dependent on what tile you happen to draw this round. Perhaps this game doesn't work with 3 players. I like it, but am beginning to wonder about the "strategy"--there's plenty of tactics, no doubt.

Update (08/09/10) 6 plays: The game is rather chaotic and random in the beginning, as each player does his/her own thing, but then becomes a tactical game of move/counter-move when play-sequences become apparent. It still hasn't gotten any traction in my gaming group.

What a beautiful game - both visually and in terms of elegant game design!  It plays very quickly, even with new players, and gradually reveals a huge amount of strategic and tactical depth.  There are three different "layers" of interaction: the two dimension structure, the three dimensional structure and the myriad ways in which settlements can expand over the surface.  This is surely the tile-layer that Knizia wishes he could claim as his own...

What an interesting tile laying game, with what I suppose is really a geological theme.  Death and destruction can actually a be good thing.  The game is visually beautiful and very clever.  It's important to get your buildings out while avoiding running out of huts too soon.  Thinking ahead helps--and looking carefully at the board is essential.  Very pleasant, very interesting, and on the whole, one of those quasi-abstract games with simple rules but a good amount of depth.  Very good.

A very clever abstract strategy game. Success demands planning ahead, but at times it makes more sense to interrupt your own plans to interfere with another player. Stopping a player from placing a temple by crushing part of their settlement can lead to enough "high ground" to wind up giving them a tower instead. Subtle, very strategic, very satisfying to see a plan come together for an unstoppable win. Expect to play it a few times before you realize all of the implications of what you and your opponents are doing.

[b]2-3 Player Review:[/b]

This is my go-to drinking game. Whenever just drinking a few Kirin Beer, shooting the breeze, and chilling, Taluva will hit the table. The speed of play, ease of rules yet surprising level of strategy, and organic nature of the game board, make it a hit every time. 

There isn't a massive level of difference between 2 and 3 player counts, except for a slight amount more randomness. And after introducing the new end game condition for tied games ...keep on building... the tension and out enjoyment has increased event more so. 

It's my favorite gateway game but leaps and bounds. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- The artwork and pieces are beautiful
- I can't help but take a photo of every island once the game is complete. They always look so interesting and cool. 
- The strategy is intense, especially if you resolve tied games by continuing to build until someone can't make a legal move. 
- Very quick and easy to teach. I've never had someone new to board games not enjoy themselves on the very first few turns. 
- Plays very quickly.

[b]Cons:[/b]

- The great game-play and simple but smart rule set makes me wish there were more building types. 
- Some advanced terrain types that add add to the strategy would be super sweet too!

  Played first time with 2P, 3 games in a row. The first game will be shaky with some rules questions and no strategy.  If you quit after one game, it will just seem like a random placement game. 2nd game will go smoother, and by the 3rd one you are no longer discussing options with your opponent, you are trying to lava them.  Some say there is a kingmaker problem, geez, the game is 15-20 minutes long, but yes, if you make a bad move, you can find yourself trying to catch up, but there is the chance your opponent will miss something and then he is behind.  Either way, the game plays fast so I don't see kingmaking as an issue such as it would be in a longer, drawn out game.   As for abstract, eh, maybe, I HATED Clans and Samurai, but this is nothing like them.  Can't compare to Tikal, Java or Attika, but it does feel a little like Carcassonne, but much deeper.  I really enjoy it and want to play again, and so does my non-geek husband.  Plus, the scoring is soooo easy, no points to count, no tokens, easy! LOVE it.

Java-lite? Yeah kinda and maybe the easiest way to sum it up. I love the 30 minute game time and the great quality components along with the low price. Probably the thickest tile stock I have ever seen, perfect insert and they even included empty bags for the pieces!

Fairly light playing although it took one game to get a sense of the strategy and it does allow you some creativity in a Java kind of way. It does feel very much like a race as essentially that's what it is, a race to get rid of your pieces.  

This is what I don't have enough of, meaty fillers for the weeknights so I might have to pick it up. There is jusssst enough to keep you interested, I'm just not sure yet for how long (I'm thinking 10 games which would be good for me, will update)

Very short, light game, with deceptively challenging tactics and some amusing moments.  You are natives living on a volcanic isle.  Each turn you place a tile and then place one or more villager pieces according to certain rules.  You win if you get two of them entirely out first or if you get more out then everyone else when the game ends.  Best part is when you place a tile on top of other tiles to form an volcanic eruption, squishing another player's villagers.  :)

The tile artwork on this game is horrible for me, being partially color blind. The lagoons and the mountains looked alike! The jungle and the volcanoes looked alike. Most of the artwork was muddled. The game itself was decent, but not very thematic or original. It's a slightly better than mediocre game.

You're looking for the best placement of your pieces, which you try to bring about by your placement of the tiles.  You also have some ability to interfere with your opponents as you try to minimize their ability to interfere with you.

So far I am very impressed with this confrontational tile-placement game. The game is vaguely reminiscent of Carcassonne (place a tile then add "meeples"), but with room for a lot more 'direct' nastiness. The connection to one of the designer's other games, Attika, is also there: Players build towards the final victory condition, but all the time have to keep an eye out for sudden death victories.

I am not sure how stable my rating is yet: It feels like Taluva is the sort of game I could easily tire of (or where, at least, I could tire of the nastiness involved). Until then, it's a solid '8'.

This is a well-designed game that has surprising depth. 2-player games are very good, but I found that more than 2 players led to the situation where one player is forced to make less than ideal plays for himself in order to prevent another player from winning. It turns into a cycle of "take that", which I dislike

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2012)

It’s been years since I last played Taluva, and I don’t remember much about the game. I only remember that I liked the game at the time and that it had an abstract component to the strategy. I remember it was a hard game for me and for that reason I want to play it again. When I do I will come back and do a proper comment on the game. Besides that, I also remember I thought the game had gorgeous components and they looked great on the table.

For now I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system.

One of the reason I like this game is because of it's scalability from 2 to 4 and that it is a really nice three player game.  Unfortunately though in the three player game one person often has to choose the winner of the other two players.  For example, their inaction may cause one other player to win.  This has great bits and I'm always up for a game.

RATING: 7
Very pretty, but extremely abstract play. In spite of being slightly sort of Carc-ish (in as much as you draw tiles and play them to create areas which you place pieces into and try to own) which we play brutally, my wife finds Taluva probably too confrontational for her tastes. It's the ability to actually destroy each other's pieces, she says, except she does enjoy Nexus Ops
:what:

Personally, I suspect that when we have an abstract game it becomes player versus player instead of fungoids vs crystallines, and in player vs player you lose a little bit of "yourself" when your pieces (and plans) get destroyed. Maybe.

Eventually traded away. (I don't usually trade stuff.)

An interesting game.  There doesn't seem to be a lot going on... I mean, 'play a tile, add a piece (or pieces)...'

But, after a couple of plays, there is definitely a lot of strategy.  Do you attack a neighbour to try and force him to continually expand with two or more huts, forcing him to expend his buildings faster?  Do you scatter a number of single huts all over the board, knowing that they cannot be covered, then expand them all for a temple win?  Coax an opponent to build a level 3 tile next to one of your settlements, knowing that you and he are the only ones who can build towers?

Aggressive play appears to be rewarded.

Lots going on for such a simple game...  a definite winner.  Best of all... it plays in about 40 minutes with 4 players so it should see the table a lot this year.

Evil Carcassonne-Chess. Very good components and feels great to build the landscape. More cerebral and with more interaction than I had expected (expected something like Carc, but this is much more about blocking opponents than screwing up for others than Carc is) Gets even better with more plays, shows that replayability doesn't always require multitudes of setup variabilities. Clever game with few rules and simple, yet impressive components (even though I would have loved for the temples and towers to have been a little more 'cleverly' designed)

RATING: 7
For as light as this game is mechanically, it plays very tight and a single mis-played tile can cost you the game. Attractive, well-made, and fast, this game should have a pretty wide appeal. It's a good design. The box, though, is an unjustified space hog!

Although folks say this is a great game for two, I think the game is ok for two but plays FAR better with 3 or 4. I think a big part of the appeal for me is the beauty of the multi-tiered landscape that evolves. It's really gorgeous.

Taluva es un juego abstracto sobre construir una civilizacion en una isla volcanica.

En cada turno se coloca una loseta y una o varias figuras. Con las losetas se trata de abrir un camino para tus figuras, o cerrarlo para las figuras de tus rivales. También puedes eliminar figuras de tus rivales con las losetas. Una vez colocada la loseta se ponen las figuras que se puedan.

Buenos materiales, y además queda muy chulo.

Taluva is a good abstract game about building a civilization along a volcanic island.

Each round, you will have to put a tile and one or some figures. Using the tiles, you will try to open a way for your figures or to close an opponent's way. You can also eliminate your opponent's figures with the tiles. Once you have played your tile, you will have to put one or more figures.

It has very good components, and it also looks so cool.[/color]

RATING: 7
There are few games which look better at the end of the game. Each game will create a completely different world of tiles and pieces. But there's also a game in there that is much deeper than the simple Carcassonne-like turn mechanism of first placing a cardboard tile and then placing a meeple suggests. Actual gameplay is more akin to a multiplayer abstract than Carcassonne. It is essential to plan your position a few turns ahead while not neglecting to thwart the preparations of your opponents. Our results were so close that there is a potential for kingmaking. Could this be avoided with more experience?

In short - Carcassone 3D. Similar tile draw and placement, but in this game there is no requirement to match one tile with others. Similar building (meeple in Carcassone) placement, only here there is no need to take them back. It is interesting that even buildings, that are removed from the game, are also counted for final scoring. However the most interesting aspect - map building upwards. Because of this you must plan where to place the tiles in order not to make too much holes. It is not hard to place the second level tile, but much harder to place the third one.

Trumpai - Carcassone 3D. Panašus kortelių traukimas ir dėliojimas, tik tiek, kad nereikia sutaikyti ką prie ko dėti. Panašiai ant kortelių reikia statyti pastatus (žmogeliukus Carcassonėje), tik tiek, kad čia nebūtina (o ir nereikia) jų atsiimti. Įdomu tai, kad net gi iš žemėlapio pašalinami namukai skaitosi skaičiuojant taškus. Na bet įdomiausias aspektas - kad žemėlapį galima statyti į aukštį. Todėl reikia tokius dalykus planuoti ir neprisidaryti per daug skylių. Antrą lygi pastatyti nėra sunku, bet trečią jau kur kas sunkiau.

RATING: 9
Mr Casasola Merkle has made a game that has a clear reminiscence to his former hit Attika, but these two games are still considerably different from each other to maintain the interest in both. Especially the difference between the two is huge in the looks. The box cover of Taluva is horrible, but what's inside looks really, really good. With Attika these are quite the opposite. Componentwise this may be the best game I've played. Mechanically this also works quite beautifully and probability of possible player elimination seems to be exceptionally low, which is just good. Two routes to victory is also good, even though the ways are not so far away from each other as in Attika and the so called regular path to victory seems to be not so usual. And just as with Attika rules are almost simple and really clear.

A little bit of luck, a little bit of chaos, and if everyone dishes out a little bit of pain now and then this is a great game. Each turn you have to make the best of what you have, while trying to think several turns in advance and hope the tables aren't turned on you until that time (or just be really clever with your tile placement to protect what you need to protect). The bonus for me is watching the island grow and change. Of course it's kinda fun to immolate your opponents' villages (or yours!) with hot lava death too...

Here's a game where the 3D levels you build up actually mean something and where it's possible to match them given planning and the pieces at your disposal. It's kind of like what I wanted [thing=16497][/thing] to be. In every game I've played, the "exception" end-game condition of all-of-two-types has been met before the regular end-game condition. The bits and artwork add lots to the enjoyment of the game; I don't know if I would play it if it were just colors and shapes.

First impression based on one play only.  I do think this game is cleverly designed... it's just that these highly geometrical abstracts are not really my cup of tea...

Also this game is kinda ugly.

In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.

Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.

[2007.Mar.02] In essence, this is a 3-dimensional, tile-laying game by veteran game designer Marcel-André Casasola Merkle. The rules are simple: (1) draw & place a new tile on the gaming surface, and (2) build (at least) one building on one of the tiles. One of the unexpected aspects of this Euro game is that players can be eliminated (which is an unusual trait for a Euro). However, this only happens if a player truly mismanages his/her settlement resources (i.e., buildings). The Rio Grande Games publication is quite appealing with elegant, wooden building pieces (3 different types) and game tiles reminiscent of Java's thick, meaty tiles.

Several games.  Been there, done that.  Nothing wrong with the game, other than a lack of fun, but it's pretty much recycled.  Slightly better as a 2 player.  I'd play again, and I might even request it, but I wouldn't buy it I don't think.

The 3D element in this game is very interesting and the game looks beautiful.

But it is a very abstract and bland game mechanic wise.

The reprint has a larger box, which is ridiculous.

a really interesting 3-dimensional abstract tile-laying game where the goal is the deplete two of your three component types while attempting to foil your opponents from doing so.  with three players, there is a chance of having kingmaker issues.

Simpler 3-D tile mountain building abstract than Java.  Basically, one seeks to erupt to victory via placing more temples or placing all of two of three types of pieces.  Play a tile and then build.  If you cannot build, you lose.  It is a beautiful abstract, but not seeing much play.  Thus, the game is moving on, and, I'd rather play Java and the extra complexity that game brings to the table.

This is an okay tile placement game. Much more enjoyable and brain burning than Carcassone. The components are extremely pleasing to the eye, especially at the end of the game when everything is out on the board and in view.  Cardboard is nice and thick for the tiles. Plays pretty quickly, and has some interesting choices to make. Player interaction is a must. This might even go up with a few more plays. Theme is rather pasted on though, but pasted on in a pretty good way.

RATING: 5
Carcassonne-like game with rules that allow for your meeples to grow and spread if given the right tile lays.  Somewhat interesting, but hard to plan ahead given that your tile plays each turn are, like in Carcassonne, pulled from a random pile.  Played 2-player, would be willing to give it a try with 3 or 4.

Nice 3D tile game.  Beautiful bits.

Destroying your opponents huts can give great feelings to those who like confrontation in games.

The rules for settlement placement are somewhat contrived, which forces you to re-read the rules if you are not accustomed enough to them.

Suffers from the "Kill Dr Lucky" syndrome, where you might have to sacrifice yourself so that the leading player does not win immediately; that's something your other opponents will appreciate.  So, it's best to play with players of a similar mastering level--or don't have a good player sit to your right.

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating after 3.5 plays (the 0.5 is from my practice game with myself, which I lost). The big confusing part of explaining this game has to do with the temples and towers. The alliteration of these playing pieces makes them difficult to distinguish the rules for each. Once past this hurdle, however, the game is a fun abstract of blocking and island building.

[update1] Rating now a 9. The rules are simple but there is a lot of depth here that isn't immediately apparent.

[update2] Rating back down to 8. It turns out we were playing with the wrong rules. I thought the "expand" option meant you had to expand all connecting hexes of the same landscape. Also we missed that you cannot destroy a settlement. This slows down the game considerably and can limit tile-laying options. Do I sense some house rules in the works?

Quick to play/teach.  Offers a lot of strategy/tactics.  I love the components and visuals of this game.  I believe this will become a staple in my collection. I feel like anyone can play and enjoy this game. Beginners will be able to play and enjoy it while more advanced players will enjoy the challenge of playing most efficiently.

The only downside is in a 3 player game there can be some kingmaking.  Would not recommend with 3 but with 2 or 4 this is an excellent game.

This one will definitly take more plays to ferret out the strategy. I'm actually worried that there isn't very much here. It's a light, fast-paced game, and has some nice elements in that you can create situations for yourself to get out multiple pieces. The luck of the draw seems mitigated by the fact that there is such a wide variety of terrain, and the fact that you can build upwards (which also allows you to play multiple pieces more predictably).The one thing that got me with this one is that there doesn't seem to be much of a way to affect other players' progress, and the game can end quite abruptly. At the end of our first game I felt like That's It?!?".

Competitive, fast-playing, and engaging title.  Not truly thematic, but the theme works for what it is.  Generally very close games, in which every tile and building placed can mean victory or defeat.  Use a timer to ensure AP does not handicap enjoyment of title; played properly, game can be easily played back-to-back.  Easy to teach.

Never should have sold this one.  Hopefully it will receive the rumored reprint in 2013.

A great 'high concept'-game: Very simple to learn, abstract but still manages to tell a story, deep strategy, beautiful pieces and board (I totaly lost the first two games). 

Remember to tell new players 117 times, that you win with temples, not towers - intuitively, you would think otherwise because there's only two towers and they place highest.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While the artwork is very nice, this is really an abstract tile laying game with a very loose theme. Several ways of winning mean that there is a variety of strategies. There is a small amount of luck involved in the tile draw, which abstract purists won't like, but it also means that the game never feels totally lopsided in favour of the better player.

The components are top-notch. The wooden pieces are attractive, and the cardboard tiles are very thick and sturdy. Again, abstract purists will probably lament the absence of bakelite (which is indeed a lovely material), but there's nothing to fault here.

Boooring! This game slightly reminds me of Java, but at least it's shorter. There is no feeling of theme at all, and a strong 'bash the leader' element, that makes this game specially displeasing.

First impression after only one opportunity to play.  I would like to play it again, the game has piqued my interest.  Very beautiful presentation, the wooden game pieces are evocative, the tiles are thick cardstock and beautiful to look at, the island as it grows really looks like the growth of a volcanic island.  One of the best looking abstract games that does not look abstract.  The gameplay requires multiple tries before I can pass judgment.  The first game is definitely a learning match, there seem to be many things to take in at once.  I like the fact that it has simple rules and is quick to play.  I sense that it has depth, I will just have to play it more to see how flexible the strategies can be and whether it can be proactive as opposed to mostly reactive.

Played once. 3D landscape building with a strong puzzle component (turn optimization). Possible endgame problems (only with 3-4 players) similar to Attika (I noticed only after concluding this that both games are from the same designer). (2007)
Played again seven years later. Somehow I liked it much better this time. There's still a weakness in that a bad move by an opponent can gift the win to another opponent, but otherwise it's fine. Rating up from 5 to 7.

The art is distinctive and evocative, but added to my difficulty in visualizing the game. Or at least the successful way to play it. This was 4-player, and I'd like to try again with 2. I think it'll end up being a little too dry, analytical, and maybe unforgiving of mistakes for my preference.

2 plays with 2 players.  I felt that the experience was brain burning and dry and not in a good way. Despite the beautiful tiles, the game is a pure abstract.  Not to mention that the game has analysis paralysis and kingmaking issues.  If you are in the market for a FUN tile laying game check out Carcassonne and its many variations.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very nice tile based game.  Players build a three dimensional island on which they have to build settlements comprising huts, towers and temples.  There are restrictions on how buildings can be placed and the terrain can be changed to accommodate or confound placement.  Players must always be able to place or they're out of the game.  Lots of nice little strategies to use.  The biggest weakness is that, particularly in 3 player games where open discussion is allowed, one player can easily become kingmaker, which is always unsatisfying. Probably better with even number of players.

An abstract game that looks great on the table and is fast to play. The gameplay (though easy to explain) is a bit odd and I can't think of another game like it; it combines a balance of building, destroying, and racing, and it took a couple of games for me to start to get the hang of it. A good amount of thought for a filler.

RATING: 7.78
First grail game. Bought an imported copy since Funagain has a monopoly on US distribution and currently has it listed as being $10 more than an important version. Seriously.

Game Quality: A solid multiplayer abstract that could almost fall into the filler area. Certainly a two-player game using 24 tiles can be cranked out in 15 or so minutes. Rulebook is four pages and that's being kind. There's a low amount of interaction but just enough to where it isn't that vicious of a game. The components are really stellar though. Random factor will go up as there are more players so people need to decide where they want that to ultimately fall. 7.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: If I was hell bent set on just getting one multiplayer abstract Samurai would likely win out if I ultimately wanted to classify it as an abstract, but I don't. Samurai gives a feel of being the meatier game and those tend to win out for me. I still think I would. Due to various issues, I fear this is becoming not worth the cost in terms of bang for buck. Granted, as I write this Samurai isn't either due to its current OOP status. If this were priced reasonably, then absolutely. 7.

Do I want to play this if asked: There's not a ton to mine from the game as it is a rather straight forward with little options type of game, but it is enjoyable for now and has the advantage of being easy, quick, and visually appealing enough to where I feel like it fills a role. Splendor is another lighter multiplayer abstract that is solid, but this feels like the decision making process is more open. 8

Overall: 7.78.

Rating Potential: The more I play it, the more I like it. Might be limited in how high it goes since for now I view Samurai as the better game, but there's not much separation.

RATING: 7
Nice game. Looks great when finish.

I enjoy the 'take that' aspects of crushing out other players settlements. Crushing out your own can be advantageous as well to open up opportunities for placing more towers and temples.

Plays well with 2, 3, or 4 but it is a different game with 2.  The game always ends when someone builds all of 2 of their components.  I like the game most with 3 or 4.

Not a heavy game but it is thinkier than it might first appear.  Not Carcassonne-ish or Java-esque in any way.

- La règle un peu floue sur un point essentiel qui change énormément l'approche stratégique du jeu; en dehors de la règle d'extension de village, doit-on placer un bâtiment seulement sur la tuile qu'on vient de poser (à la carcassonne) ou peut-on le placer sur n'importe quelle tuile? Il semble que la règle officielle concerne la deuxième option. Par contre, selon mon avis (et selon celui de quelques autres), le jeu gagne en profondeur stratégique en suivant la première option.

I really like this game (unfortunetly the wife isn't so keen on it).  It's a 3-dimensional tile laying game akin to carcassone, but hinges a lot more on strategic placement rather than opportunistic placement.  Doesn't use VP's for winning (a good thing for a change), and with multiple end/win conditions, keeps things very challenging and tense.

Terrific tile placement game.

I love the 3rd dimension, à la JAVA and the building placement.  I also love the mechanism by which you could lose the game all by yourself if you are not careful.  Great stuff and I would even go as far as to say classic stuff.

Taluva is a complete dud at us, all because it's so damn beautiful. No one willing to destroy anything on this enchanted tropical paradise failing to understand the basic strategy of the game. When I dare to place a volcano on a hut I get banished from the table and have to stand in a corner. It's fucking crazy; here's a fantastic game, themed horribly wrong.

Have played several times with 2 and 4 players so far.  It's simple, clever and beautiful, all things I like in a game.  I really like the way that if someone attacks you, it generally opens up other options for you that may be even better, so attempted attacks on others are risky.  Decided to bump it up from an 8 to a 9.

Taluva est un jeu de placement simple mais riche.
Perdue quelque part au milieu de l'océan, se trouve une île au terrain torturé et à l'activité volcanique importante. Elle voit plusieurs peuples en dédoudre pour tenter de s'y implanter, et comme l'espace est trés limité, la lutte promet d'être intense et rapide. Le jeu propose à chaque joueur de prendre en main la destinée d'un de ces peuples pour essayer de le mener à la victoire...

18 oct 07. Essen buying spree.

Beautiful looking & fairly short tactical game. Actually an abstract in disguise, but the glued on theme works for me. Works with 2-players as well, gets more cut-throat with more. 

Playable in a "filler" time of 30 minutes with 2. Yes, it looks like Java, but it's a totally different game. I like it a lot.

Update after a half year and plenty of games: rating goes UP. Love to pull this one of the shelf for it's "light" feel, but fascinating gameplay.

NL: prachtig tactisch legspel waarbij je probeert voor je tegenstander(s) je 2 torens en 3 tempels te bouwen. En daar offer je af en toe eventueel een van je eigen hutjes voor op...

Vlot spel, met zijn 2-en in een half uur te doen. Blijvertje.

I'm still not sure about Taluva even after 10 plays. On one hand, it's a beautiful, original because 3D, tile laying game that has the right length. On the other hand, I suspect that the screw-the-other moves which destroy huts simply are not useful enough for oneself's game plan. As such, the game would actually discourage interaction, taking away any most of the "game" there was. A game like this absolutely NEEDS a balance between helping self and screwing others.

A hearty "Meh" for this one. The artwork is nice, I can see why an abstract fan might get into this, but it's not my thing. It just doesn't draw me into the action or immerse me in the theme, and it's more or less a puzzle that (like most puzzles) intrigues me for a minute or two then fades quickly.
I'm never quite sure whether to nod in appreciation or shake my head in bemusement at the way Euros lamely attempt to paste a theme on to games that really are just abstract, competitive puzzles. Do Euro fans really need these (usually) pasted-on themes to enjoy the games? Are the cute volcanoes really a selling point on this one? Does it really make it more fun? Couldn't the tiles just be shapes and the buildings just pieces?

Tile-laying abstract with a lot of meaty choices where tiles can be layed next to or on top of one another.  I imagine this would be great as a two-player.  It's good with three but that introduces a bit of table-talk and possible kingmaking (same problems with Attika).

Gorgeous game with simple rules that can be taught in a few minutes. Even when playing with an AP prone opponent, a game shouldn't take much time, as you only get 12 rounds each. Setup goes just as quickly as teaching the rules. I don't know how much emergent complexity that can be found in the small rule set. I might get tired of it eventually, but after 7-8 plays I'm eager to play more and explore new paths to victory.

This game was much more fun than I was expecting. It's basically an abstract. It took be a couple plays before I began to see opportunities (for myself or my opponents) and could properly strategize and block. Very fun with three.

First play - "this game is awful, I have no idea what I am doing, or why." Every other play - "this game is fantastic! I want to go there, but I can't because my opponent will exploit it, but if I go here, I can really screw him and then win the game by doing this, this and this". A quick game where it is vital not to leave yourself open to an eruption that sets you back a turn or two. Changes wildly with 4 players, but still a top notch game.

This great essentially abstract game is Java-lite, with the look and feel of the great game Java but without quite the complexity of that game. Here you place a single tile and then place one or more buildings. There are no action points to plan out meticulously as in Java. So if you love Java like I do, but don't want a game that can bring out the AP in players, this is a great game.

Deeply flawed game - no green pieces.  Apart from that, an excellent 2-player game.  Lots to think about, a small amount of randomness in the tile draw, but still very strategic.

"Of course, Taluva is a tactical and strategic game, where accurate evaluation of every position is required for the placement of every tile and pawn, and where errors are never forgiven. I had not guessed that it was also a fast paced and dynamic game, reminiscent of Carcassonne %u2013 but a more involved, more pure, more concentrated Carcassonne." - Faidutti

RATING: 6
Only played two thirds of a game so far, but it's strangely interesting. My analogy is a smarter and more interesting version of Carcassonne with a touch of Tikal thrown in. Its got some nice production values. Its nice to see some hefty carboard used, which is necessary I guess to emphasise the three dimensional aspect of the game, although the tiles artwork is a bit too busy for me. I'd be willing to try this game a few more times, but I'll want to familarise myself with the rules before playing again (the person who explained the rules to me did a typically crap job of it). I suspect that this game may be a bit too abstract for me to really enjoy over the long run.

Well, it's pretty, I'll give it that. As far as a game goes, it feels a little meh. Don't get me wrong, I think there is room for creative play, and I like how the game changes with different player counts, but the game feels a little samey from game to game. I think abstract fans could very well enjoy this game, but for me, the tile placement was a little unexciting, the game can degenerate into serious AP, and the main strategy seems to be to get your temples and towers out ASAP. I wouldn't mind playing this if asked to, but it didn't rock my world or anything.

Great game, great components.  I've never seen cardboard so thick before.  3-hex tiles that you use to build up the terrain, volcanic eruptions that cause the landscape to rise, thus allowing the placement of your towers.  Played numerous times, and it always ends with a premature victory, by playing all of 2 of your 3 types of pieces.

Taluva reminds a bit about games like Java, Carcassonne and Torres but with much cleaner and more elegant mechanisms. You play on an island that is changed by tiles being placed next to other tiles or on top of them so that any previous settlement are partially removed. On this island you must play out your three kinds of settlements: ordinary huts, temples which require settlements of three areas and towers which require heights of at least three areas. The tiles can be used not only to block or harm other players but also to open up new areas or even split own settlements and allow the building of more temples and towers. In other words, strategy and tactics in many different dimensions!

In this game, the tiles are composed of three terrain hexes. There is always a volcano and two different types of either lakes, woods, scrubs, and ore. Tiles may be placed on top of other tiles, provided the volcano flow is different. Players must place huts, temples or towers onto the tiles. Huts can be started individually, then expanded onto like terrain. Temples can go on a settlement of at least 3 huts. Towers can go on level 3 terrain. Tiles placed on top of other tiles may wipe out huts, but may never wipe out an entire settlement. The winner is the person to get all of 2 types of buildings on the board, or if the game ends when all tiles are drawn, the person who has the most temples.

This is a game that I liked quite a bit the first time I played it but subsequent plays lowered my opinion. It's certainly not a bad game - in fact, the tile laying and building rules are rather clever. The problem is that every game I played felt almost exactly the same, even though the victory conditions are varied. At this point in my collecting of game, this one just doesn't make the cut, though I would be willing to play it from time to time if it were requested by others.

I am always on the lookout for games that play well for three players, and this one does.  I found the strategy in this game very alluding.  I couldn't figure out where to place the tiles optimally, or when and where to place my own buildings either.  In the end I just was starting to get a grasp on the strategy and it was over, so it plays quickly as well!  I like that this quick game has such complexity in it and I hope to play again soon.

Super easy-to-learn rules and very fast play are their 2 main advantages.

Also, the components are great. The land tiles are ultra-thick and the insert is cool.

But the game is completely abstract (gameplay feels even more abstract).

I have not played it out, but I guess it has at least several games until we get tired of it.

Still, it's a game that very few people will fall in love with.

I traded it away because no one wanted to play it. I still think I would have enjoyed some other games.

RATING: 7
First impression: Only played as an 2 player game. Game is an abstract with some paste-up theme. It's a good game but I wouldn't want to play it with more than 2 players. The way game is a all about actively building your own position and ruining it for other player(s), I don't think it works with 3 or 4 players. There it isn't always obvious who you should hit which leads easily into (unconscious) kingmaking situations. As a two player game it works very well and ending conditions are cleverly crafted. For some reason I like this more than many other abstracts.

I've revised my ratings for this a few times, and ultimately it hits a 9. It's one of those games which is simple, but has endless subtle wrinkles in it. I'm always learning and figuring out new strategies, but it's not so overcomplicated that it's beyond my grasp to play well. An excellent game.

RATING: 6.5
OK game, a combination of tile placement and area control. I find some parts of the rules a bit counterintuitive considering the game theme (i.e.: huts can be destroyed by the lava when a new tile is placed on top of them, but only if there are 2 or more of them. Towers and temples can not be destroyed by the lava, but huts can.)

RATING: 6.3
Non so cosa sia ma non mi convince. Troppo astratto, troppi calcoli, troppa paralisi d'analisi per essere un gioco da 45'. Per il resto non c'è che dire, molta strategia, zero fortuna (ad eccezione di eventuali errori di chi vi precedete che possono condizionare la partita) con regolamento semplice e set-up veloce. Un gioco che sta riscuotendo un buon successo ma rimane un titolo che non mi coinvolge.

RATING: 7
One of those games which can sway violently between screwage and mutual co-operation, depending on who you play it with. Looks gorgeous on the table and the luck of the tile draw is very well-mitigated by player ability, although the bits are a bit less tactile than I'd anticipated. Classy gameplay with plenty to keep your eye on, given the relatively simple ruleset.

Further Thoughts: This has dropped down the ratings now, purely because games can be ended too quickly via Hive-type thinkiness. It's ceased to be enough fun for its length. Downgraded from 8 to 6.5.

I liked it much better with 4 players. I didn't feel nearly so picked on. 17Mar07--I won! Luck of the Irish, or do I finally get it? 21Oct07--I beat Bobby4th in a 2-player game! One out of Three ain't bad...right? 03Nov07--The closest game ever. Four of us played. Any of us could have won. It came down to the last tile. Bobby and Caitlyn ended up with each other's tiles, I think. Kyle's a lucky bastard. He got a "premature win" on his last turn, preventing me from winning with the most temples played. At least that's how I think it worked out. I know I got the bastard part right anyway.

[b]Taluva[/b] was a TasCon 2017 auction purchase.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm going to have to stop saying I don't like abstracts; if you paste a good theme on it and have really nice components I'm in. Taluva joins Barony as another abstract I really enjoy, the fact that both feel like area control games definitely helps. The production is as good as Barony, which is saying a lot, the tiles and wooden pieces are beautiful. The tiles are also extremely thick so the expanding board you create looks impressive by the end of the game. 

The rules are deceptively simple and easily taught, but Taluva is a deep game with room for clever play. It can be just as advantageous to destroy your own pieces as well as your opponents, so the destruction of pieces doesn't feel particularly nasty. I wouldn't describe Taluva as a take that game, instead it you are constantly jockeying for board position as you race to place all of your pieces. 

Taluva has become an instant hit in my house, garnering a lot of plays in a short amount of time. I should also note that this game flies by with two players, we can get in a couple of games in a little over a half hour. Taluva will definitely be an evergreen in our collection.[/i]

Purchased September 2008. I love "Attika" by Mr. Merkle and I'm impressed by this game's overall rating, given that it was published in 2006. More abstract than "Attika," but no less challenging. I give a clear edge to "Attika" for having more feel of a theme, but this is definitely a game in which one has many options to think about simultaneously. Although this didn't click for me the way "Attika" did, I played it enough to see this mainstream Euro as worthwhile to play once in a while, in my book. However, I traded it, September 2010.

Fun game that appears to scale well from 2 to 4 players without too much king-making, which I found surprising given the nature of the game.  It seems that squashing one person's holdings tends to just give them a better opportunity down the road, so great care must be taken before plunking down a tile just for the sake of 'hurting' someone.  I like it a lot, not least because the components are excellent.  Thick, chunky tiles and very pretty to boot, coupled with unique-looking wooden bits make this a game that nearly everyone stops to take a closer look at when it's on the table.

Seems like a somewhat random game.  My first play I was able to trick the other players to get my towers out easily, which is the reason I am not a huge fan o this game.  For players familiar with the game, it seems there would be a lot of kingmaking.  The components are nice, and it did play fast.

A nice tile laying game that I find to be aesthetically very appealing. It's almost as if the goal of the game is to make it as beautiful looking as possible and if possible also earning some points. Very nice. It's actually more tactical then it might look at first. If you just play it the way you'd play carcassonne for example it's just a simple "race" game to see who's the first to dispatch his two types of buildings, but you can actually interfere quite heavily in an opponents game, since the towers and temples require specific conditions to be placed, you can actually, especially in the case of the temples mess in others' affairs. Can be quite interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick filler, with different strategies for 2 vs 4 players (never tried it with 3.) With two players, the trick is to run out of two types of pieces before your opponent (usually huts and temples.) With four players, you need to place as many temples as possible before the tiles run out.

Simple to learn, lots of interaction. A great game for anyone and works well with any number of players (2-4). You need to get rid of two types of your pieces by playing them on the board, which is being built by you and the others. But as two of the types of pieces have specific placement rules and others can use tiles and pieces to block you, there is a constant battle for location. It is a really nice looking game as well. They chose nice colors and the design was really though out so that it looks a certain way.

Taluva is a three-dimensional tile-laying game in which players are trying to run out of two types of wooden tokens.  The three types of tokens all have different placement rules--huts are kind of generic, temples reward spreading out, and towers reward building up.  The triple-hex tiles can either be placed at the edge of the map, or on top of other tiles, potentially destroying existing tokens (which go out of the game).  It takes clever play to maximize your own placements while denying the expansion of others.  This is probably my favorite filler game.  I love the spatial thinking, and being forced to react to the play of others, both offensively and defensively.  Plus, the game is absolutely beautiful.

For how simple the game is overall, it was actually a lot more challenging than I expected. Very aesthetically pleasing. The original version is just as excellent as the deluxe version. The only thing I've noticed in the deluxe version is larger pieces for everything. It looks nice, but it's too much of a table hog.

We did mess up a critical rule though that you cannot cover up a settlement completely. This wasn't too much of an issue, but it always felt odd to me that you could just kill off someone else's starting settlement. With the corrected rule in place, the game is much, much better.

Update: With repeat plays, I have to say this game has really grown on me. I liked it a lot on first blush, but it's just so quick playing and pretty. It's like a less involved Carcassonne with a upward spatial aspect which I really enjoy. A keeper and one I'm glad that I finally got to play. I almost passed this one by.

Solid game of abstract placement of tiles and wood.  I like the different triggers for game end and winners.  I like the interaction between opponents, especially with burying and blocking each other.

Another MACM game I enjoy. Extremely lush production - just beautiful to watch the game unfold. Played aggressively, the 2P game has a lot of interaction and tactical challenges. Similar to Attika in weight and abstraction, though plays a bit quicker. I'm interested in picking up a 2nd set for Super-Taluva.

Update: There's a lot more tactical depth to this game than to Attika. The 2P game is largely a battle of tempo, with each player trying to set up build combos while blocking the other. There's definitely a learning curve in figuring out the best placements and responses. Learning how to use extra layers to make safe valleys is key, as is taking advantage of the fairly rare tiles with identical landscapes. This is an excellent game between two experienced players.

The progressive volcanic birth of an island has to be one of the most satisfying board game mechanics ever devised.  Flow over your own huts to build another temple!  Provide a tempting target so that an opponent sets up a place to build a third level for your tower!  Place exactly the number of huts you have available by flowing into three different hexes!  And all along collectively give birth to a new world isolated in a sea of potential.  

So simple, so beautiful.  Another human invention I feel was ultimately inevitable.

A suprisingly simple game that plays quickly with a heck of a lot of brain burning.  It's an interesting game of maniuplation and anticipation.  The game does look good, perhaps a bit convoluted and to its detriment, as the land pieces look so 'busy' that it can be hard to get a good overall picture of the board.

So what happens?  In this game, players are given a bunch of huts, a few temples, and then a couple of towers.  The goal is to try and use all of two kinds on the board before your opponent does.  If you can't do that, then at least have the most of the best kind on the board.. but be careful!  You have to be able to build at all times, and if you can't, you lose!

So, players take a tile and lay it down, anywhere on the board, provided that it touches with an already existing piece.  Eventually, the island will grow - upwards - via volcanoes.  Players will be able to play new tiles on top of existing onces.  This could possible displace some pieces while creating opportunity for others.

I recieved this in a trade and I quite like it.  It's simple as heck.  It would have been good if the game could support more than 4 players, but as is it's a decent title.  For now, I would be happy to play this again.

Beautiful pieces, easy to learn, but it does values euro mechanics over theme. Rules restrictions may seem a bit arbitrary for some, but most love the beautiful pieces and simple gameplay. A great example of a game that is "easy to learn, but difficult to master".

Reminds me of Tikal but much, much lighter.  There's some very interesting balancing mechanics that are streamlined into the game.  Squishing other players prevents temples, but can help make the foundation for towers.  The fact that volcanoes must be layed upon volcaones seems to create situations where one can't squish too many times in the same area.

It's quick, reasonably elegant and nice to look at. I'm really bad at this kind of spatial abstract though - I find it hard to envisage how the island is going to grow in 3-D. And there's something slightly irritating about how little it usually matters which tile you draw compared to how much it might matter right at the end of the game.

Right off the bat I can say that I adore the bits & pieces of this game, nice artwork, sturdy tiles and cute little buildings, great. The game itself is a Carcassonne plus 3D plus Puzzle variant which is more intricate than it looks. I have played it once and was overwhelmed at first and intrigued later. I reckon that the game becomes more cutthroat and interactive the more experienced the players become and start minding not only their own business. A good game with a slightly confusing final scoring system but other than that, thumbs up, this is subject to increase in rating once I get my head around it.

Players take it in turns to place tiles that make up the Island, through a series of volcanic eruptions. They then place their meeples, which come in three different flavours. Each flavour has a different set of rules for how it is placed. And the simple but elegant objective is to be the first player to get rid of all of two different types of meeples.
This games strengths are its simple rules, quick play time, and the visual effect of the gradually increasing height of the island.

Normally, we detest negative player interaction in games (e.g, 'take that!', backstabbing, etc), and though this game has that, it's not a major issue because often, the negative interaction (the volcano tiles) can end up helping you, and none of your work is really ruined. Taluva is very light and quick, we play a game in about 15-20 minutes max. Really fun!

Once upon a time several years ago we were turned off by this game after an incompetent explanation by someone at Essen.

But I was curious since people praised it, so finally we played it again at Brzeski Festiwal 2010-01-31 and liked it enough to impulse purchase it that very day. Nice simple clear elegant rules - I don't know why the explainer had such trouble explaining it to us at Essen. :)

It's one of those games where the strategy seems quite nonobvious the first time you play. That gives us a fun sense of aha-discovery. And it seems to work fine with 2, 3, and 4 players (with different feel for different number of players).

Plus the tiles are really thick and chunky and sturdy and nice feeling.

Finally, the game is very quick to set up and put away, and doesn't take too long to play. A big plus for us!

--Oct2007-- After one 2p game, it looks quite amusing.  It's basically an abstract - though not quite as clean a formulation as a Gipf game.  There's a bit of randomness (in the landscapes that appear with the volcano on each tile drawn) but it doesn't seem to overwhelm play.  I'd be very happy to play again.
--Dec2009-- After a play with 4, I think I prefer the 2p game.

While building a beautiful 3-D landscape, you easily forget that it's basically an abstract game of territorial domination. Marcel succeeds where other, more complicated games like Torres or Java fail. Plays quick and the playing field is of exactly the right size.

RATING: 5
You know, it really is Java lite. Plays fast, but it's not overly spectacular. I find there's a lot of competition in the "not overly spectacular" game section. The advantage of Taluva over many games in this category is that it's an okay game that you can squeeze in before the real gaming begins, so I suppose it has a place on the gaming shelf. Can can suffer from the multiplayer problem of the player who's picked on the least will win. Frustrating at times with three players - two or four seems to be the right balance. The last few turns can be a foregone conclusion. If there's competition at the end with a multiplayer game there seems to be a big kingmaker potential. So, it's visually great, but the problems needed to be ironed out somehow with potentially clunky rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty, pretty... I love the aspect of the finished game. Plenty of opportunities to mess up with the plans of your opponent(s). Somehow, two-player games are often too close... three-player is very nice if all the players master the game and don't let a leader run away. Four-player I have yet to try...

I'm not sure this game gets enough love.  Some of the rules are a litte non-intuitive, but I really like this quick-playing tile-laying strategy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like the look of this game. Each tile is in the shape of three hexes; one of the hexes is a volcano, and the others are various terrain types. Each turn players place a new tile and then make or expand settlements.

To play a tile, you can either expand into the ocean (adjacent to the board on at least one edge) or an existing volcano can erupt, allowing you to overlay the tile on existing tiles. Tiles can get as high as three "stories," although the placement rules make that challenging to do.

Placing a tile over existing tiles (erupting) is a little complicated: you overlay a tile so that the volcano hex on the tile being placed sits over the volcano hex on the tile underneath. Tiles may not "perfectly" overlay each other; that is, a tile must sit on top of at least two other tiles. You may not cover temples or towers, but you can cover huts: these huts are removed FROM THE GAME. You may not do this if it would cause an entire settlement to disappear.

To make a settlement you place a hut on an empty, non-volcano, first-story hex.

To expand settlements you can play a temple, tower, or hut adjacent to an existing settlement of yours. Towers may only be placed on a third story hex. Temples may only be added to settlements of at least three hexes in size. When huts are placed, you put one hut for each story. To expand with a hut, choose a terrain type that is adjacent to the settlement, and place huts in each adjacent hex of that terrain type. This is a fast way to get rid of your huts. You may only place a temple or tower next to a settlement that doesn't already have one, although it's okay if this action causes two settlements to merge, even if that gives it more than one temple or tower.

And you want to get rid of huts, but not as much as you want to get rid of temples and towers, because you score for having the fewest settlement pieces in your supply at the game end. The player with the fewest towers wins, or if that's a tie, then the fewest temples, etc. You can also instantly win the game if you have only one KIND of settlement piece left (e.g., all huts).

The distinction of "fewest in your pool" is important. You're not trying to get more pieces on the board, so much as you're trying to get rid of pieces. So placing your tiles on top of other people's huts doesn't hurt their score any (the huts are removed from the game), although it may impact their ability to add more pieces to the board.

I enjoyed the game and would be happy to play again.

First impression.  For a fairly quick abstract (although would probably bog down with AP once played a few more times or with the wrong players) with a surprising lot of meat for a simple rule set this hits the spot.

Very pretty and interesting spatial placement game that forces you to think spatially in 3 dimensions instead of 2. Interesting win and lose conditions mean you can sometimes teeter on the edge of either. The strategy is counter-intuitive and subtle, so some tips are probably necessary when teaching newbies (what, I should destroy my own huts?). I think, with a good teaching job, this can be a very impressive game to non-gamers with its visual impact and refreshing strategy.

2009: 8. Similar to Samurai, you've got simple rules that are easy to pick up but the implications of those rules aren't realized until after a few plays.  You again also need to co-operate at the same time as you're competing with your opponents in order to place your pieces.  *Amazing* production values, the game looks beautiful. However, hasn't really been a hit with my gaming group, so haven't played much.

2013 UPDATE: 8. Played the game a few times last Christmas and had some surprise wins for my brother in some one-on-one games.  In this mode, it really felt very chess-like, or reversi or go: you're sorta waiting for the other player to make a mistake and be in a position to capitalize on it. Want to play more now, but to enjoy it I think I need gamers: it's too easy to dominate and walk all over casual gamers.

Definitely scores points for gorgeous-looking components. The tiles are thick and colourful and the wooden bits seem to be original and not recycled from another game. Gameplay however, disappoints. Players draw a tile to place each turn. Tiles have a variety of different landscaps that affect how settlements expand. Players then either place a new settlement or expand on an existing one. The object is to get get rid all the pieces of one type. Tile level, terrain and size of settlements affect how pieces can be placed.

What irked me was the volcano terrain. Each tile has a volcano terrain that can be used to destroy any settlement (with more than 1 village in it) it's placed over. This means that players can constantly do 'take that' moves if they want to. Someone who carefully places his settlements at the edges and flies under the radar will do well. If two players get in a Volcano war, expect them to hand the game to the other players. Kingmaking anyone?

Cutthroat game. Period. This IS a 2 player game. 3-4 player games are not fun unless EVERY PLAYER goes after the player before them. It plays awesome as a strategic 2 player game.

Very nice looking game.  Game itself seems interesting based on one play, but need to try it some more.  It reminds of the layers of Java, I game I love, so quite possibly the rating will rise.

Pretty difficult to figure out strategy the first time I played, but interesting.  On a side note, you really have to feel sorry for the Taluvans what with the endless volcanoes and some roving yahoo who wants to put your skull on his crotch.

Interesting tile-laying mechanics. The theme is very far off and I would prefer such games to just be abstracts and say so.
Production is nice and everything is beautifully done. The game works well.
It is just that I would prefer a real abstract.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very nice low key two player game.  The gameplay builds much the same way that Java does in how you want to divide settlements to shift your people away from sections.  You want to cordon off your folks from the temples or towers you just built.  The board has a nice growth to it and it never feels overly lucky or out of control.  Two players is lovely, three players is a little better.  I'd imagine with four this could get quite chaotic.

RATING: 3.5
The strategy doesn't make any sense. The weird volcano thing doesn't help either. Are we supposed to want to get flooded by lava or not? I assume if I worked at it for long enough I could uncover the subtleties, but I don't think there's enough buried here to make it worth the digging.

This game is fantastic. It's one of the first games I introduce to new players.

The game is abstract but the theme adds an excellent look. Highly recommended.

My track record with abstracts is poor.  But this game is just a blast to look at and play.  *Update* - after collecting dust for over a year, got to pull it out again and realized why I liked this game so much in the past.  Just an excellent, fast-playing tile-laying game with a lot of choices and fun.  Absolutely gorgeous.

Great tile-placement game.  The game is absolutely beautiful and it plays very quickly.  There's some interesting choices to make in balancing the advancement of your cause to preventing others from making progress.  A quality game in my book.

UPDATE:  While beautiful, quick, and fun, it appears that the simple strategy of trying to place all of your huts first generally is enough to win the game.  Given the lack of interesting strategic options, have to lower this down to a 7.

UPDATE #2: Moving back up to an 8, as I find it fun and entertaining to try to win without running through all of my huts.

UPDATE #3: It's pretty and it's fast, and it looks great on a table in a coffee shop, but I don't think that it really has a ton of replayability. Still fun to get out now and then.

RATING: 8
A great little tile laying and building placement game.  Awesome for 2 players (but we recommend playing with only half the tiles, as suggested by some BGGers), and pretty good with 3 or 4.  Great looking components, only 4 pages of rules (of which half are examples anyway), and finishes in less than an hour.  Like Carc in some ways, but quite unlike it in others.  Highly recommended, but not all that easy to procure these days.

RATING: 4
Interesting tile-laying design that I found difficult to learn. The rules aren't complicated so much as unintuitive compared to other tile-layers like Samurai, Carcassonne, and Attika. I prefer those games for their purity and simplicity. But I like the three dimensional aspect of Taluva; it's visually striking, particularly at the end. 

Despite the eye candy, I find the game oddly unsatisfying to play. I'm not sure why.

It isn't very compelling; it's much like other games of it's ilk.  It would be fine as a light game for a family and is of similar weight to Carcassonne.  The nasty part of putting tiles on top of other tiles dries up pretty quickly.  With a few more plays (and the right ruleset), I found that I enjoyed this game more.

RATING: 6
It's an abstract game, apparently with kingmaker problems if played with more than 2. Players have 3 types of tokens: a bunch of houses, 3 temples and 2 forts. Tiles are 3 hexes attached in a triangular setup, with different types of terrain. Each turn you must place a tile, then place a token (lose if you cannot). Tiles may be placed on top of each other, but never exactly on 1 tile. Houses are placed in all like terrain hexes (you pick type) adjacent to your village (=group of houses). Temples must be played on level 2, but only 1/village. Forts must be played on level 3 (only 1/village?). When laying tiles on other tiles, can play over houses (removed from game) but not temples of forts. First to play all pieces of 2 types wins!

The pieces are beautiful! The game is actually pretty good, although I don't care much for abstracts. If you do like those this is likely like up your alley!

A fun, quick tile laying game.  The rules are simple but there are several little tricks you can use to slow down your opponent or help yourself (hopefully both in one move) that you may not discover on your first play.  It's very good with just 2 players but I enjoy it with more, too.

BestWith:3>4>2. Very good with 2 (we use 2 sets of pieces each) [Abstract]

Björn's Description: "A fast three dimensional tile placement game. With really cute huts and volcanos, that can destroy the huts."

Use 12 tiles per player (times sets being played if playing multiple sets). We play Variants 1 and 2.

Variant 1: Two player, with each of us controlling 2 colors which are considered the same.

Variant 2: You cannot connect settlements if it will cause multiple towers or multiple temples in a settlement as a result.

Variant 3: Double Taluva: 3 towers, 4 temples, 30 huts, and 18 tiles per player.

RATING: N/A
It's a filler. A good solid filler. It can be fun if everyone tries to destroy everyone's settlements. Lots of volcano activity thats what we're suposed to expect from this game.
I'm glad I bought it.

UPDATE
Great game for 2 players. I have lots of fun playing it with 3 players but with 2 is how the game really shines.

Played it 4 times in a single day, seems quite enjoyable. I suspect the rating will go up. Seemed to work fine with 3 and 4. Got around to playing it 6 times now with only 2 (3 different opponents so far.) Seems to work at all numbers. Despite the rules stating the normal ending is when all the tiles are used up, we only came close to this ending with 4. With three and two, the end is always when someone builds all of two kinds. (Even second place in a three player achieved this goal.)

Very nice multi-player abstract. I was afraid this would suffer from the Attika-syndrom, where players are forced to prevent the player to their left from winning, giving other players a free ride. But this is fortunately hardly noticable and even if it would, it still plays great with just two. Would like to play this more often.

I'm glad I bought Taluva. My wife likes it because the rules are short and easy to understand, and it presents enough interesting tactical choices that I can enjoy it as well. It's lighter than I want when playing with hard corps gamers, but a very good choice in social gaming situations.

Update: It turns out my wife really doesn't like it much, and we've stopped playing. However, it was simple enough to learn and attractive enough that we got through 9 games, which made it a worthwhile purchase.

I have mixed feelings about this.  For the most part I like it better than Attika (by the same author).  But we seem to get a kingmaking situation in the endgame practically every time, and your success does depend a bit too much on what opportunities your righthand opponent is kind enough to leave you with.  On the plus side, it's fun to figure out what you can do with your turn, and it's nice that there are different ways of sneaking around toward victory.

Came in expecting to really enjoy this, but just was left feeling a bit empty.  The lack of congruency in landscape leaves it looking much more jumbled and ugly than Carcassonne, and the victory conditions just didn't feel all that interesting to me.  Easy to overthink.  I liked the neat vertical building but just overall felt unimpressed.

This is a splendid game of tile and building placement based on a volcanic pacific? island. The game tiles are very solid (and extremely colourful) and this helps enormously with the 3D element of the tile laying, as the island not only grows in overall area but upwards. AP can cause a bit of downtime with the wrong players but even my slow group managed to finish a 4 player in 90 minutes. Played twice with 3 players and both times the game was won by a player using up two types of building.

Thematic tile-placement abstract strategy game. On each turn players have to draw a tile with three different terrain types on them (one of which will be a volcano) and place them alongside or on top of other already placed tiles. They then place a building of three different types, each with their own placement rules (huts can only be placed on a level one tile, towers on a level three tile, temples next to a settlement consisting of three or more occupied land spaces etc) with the aim of exhausting their supply of two types of these buildings thereby winning the game. Both aspects of the gameplay require quite a lot of thought and decisions have to be made on whether it's best to place tiles to benefit yourself or to hinder your opponents. The theme fits well into the game and strong strategic play is generally rewarded making this overall a good abstract placement game.

tl;dr: classic style euro

This is kind of the quintessential clean, elegant, classic euro: few components, few rules, good deep strategy and tactics.
This game has one type of tiles (with different terrain types) and some wooden bits for each player. Everything has some fairly easy to grasp placing rules and there are fairly easy end game conditions and scoring. It all comes together in a fairly short but very replayable game with good strategy and tactics.
This game doesn't work great with 3 if 2 players go head to head, as the third player will come out on top. But in games with minimal interaction it works great with all player counts. I think it's also excellent with 2.

I enjoy Taluva greatly. Partly as its a joy to watch the Island and its civilisation grow in-front of you, and partly as the game-play is both simple yet imaginative. The volcano building mechanic is very clever and provides plenty of different opportunities to build your settlements, and destroy others!  This is an abstract game at heart, but the gorgeously thick land tiles, and the neat wooden huts, temples and towers really do a great job transporting you to this strange land.

Very interesting gameplay with the 3rd dimension playing a factor (i.e. layers up allows other pieces to be played). Strategic placing of pieces makes you consider your options carefully.

Also like the ability to win in more than one way - lets you sneak up on the other player if they aren't considering your plans.

The game itself is very tough to formulate a strategy at first blush, but after a few games under one's belt, different tactics and strategies become apparent. I've played it 2-player 3 times, 3-player 3 times and 4-player once. 4-player might be a bit chaotic, but it is still a fun game. The thing I like about this game is that it only takes about 30 minutes to play, but one feels like one has made the same number of decisions in a 90 minute game. This game is very solid, well thought out and play-tested. Highly recommended.

Bright colors, thick chunky tiles, and beautiful artwork are essential to the Taluva experience.  Without them, this is an inspired but routine abstract game that successfully, but barely, integrates the third dimension into gameplay.  In other words, the illusion of mountains and valleys is more successful than the rule that requires towers to be on top of mountains.

Upon further review, my wife and I agree that we both really like this game.  I had bought it in my very first large online order, played it once, we both hated it, and traded it away.  I recently came into a copy via math trade, and we both found that we actually liked it--the key is not expecting a Carcassone-type game.

I had a two-player learning game last night.  First impression of this game is how utterly BEAUTIFUL it is.  Rules/mechanics are quite easy to pick up, and the game plays fast.  Who knows how it will hold up in replay value, but for now I eagerly await my next game.

Update: Played one 3 player and one 4 player session yesterday, and we had so much fun I just had to bump this up to a 9.  3 player was markedly more exciting than 2 player (but 2 player still more strategic), and 4 player was utter CHAOS but made you think about every move you were doing!  What a great game.

Update: Played another 4 player game.  This one was enjoyable as well.  I am bumping this down slightly because this game was rather bumpy.  Specifically, one player kind of made his own little peninsula late in the game, and none of us were able to counter it without scheming amongst one another.  Kind of a weird "kingmaker" feeling resulted.  Oh well.  Still a ton of fun to play and will never decline a game.

Actually a really fun game with 3 or 4 players, trying to figure out a way to build up an interesting area without giving too much advantage to those around you. Lacks tension in 2p game, even with reduced tiles, due to better enabling turtling. There just isn't enough motivation to interact with the other person.

First Impression:

A great light tile-laying game.

There is some good strategy here and the game flows well and very quick. The final result with the multiple levels is also very attractive.

I didn't like the possible player elimination near the end of the game. It's ok to slow down a runaway leader (which however is not at all an issue in this game) but still it feels cheap when you're suddenly out because of slight miscalculation or an aggressive enemy block. It's less of an issue however in such a quick game.

All in all I did like this game.

Visually stunning game -- a completed game is really something to behold with its multiple levels, bright colors, and interesting pieces.  Gameplay is very intriguing as well.  It's tile laying, but feels different from most other tile laying games due to the vertical element.  I found it interesting with 4, but IMO it really shines with 2 because there is so much more control and room for thinking ahead (and it isn't about leaving a blocking move to the last person who is able to do so).

SOLD (March 2015) --- While I definitely didn't like Marcel-André Casasola Merkle's most popular previous release (Attika), I'm hoping that Taluva takes more after Java, one of my all-time favorites.  This looks like it could be a great lighter 2-player version of Java, but then again Wolfgang Kramer has some awfully large shoes to fill, which I'm not sure that Merkle can do.

About [thing=24508][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=24508][/thing] is a tile-laying game in which players put Huts, Temples or Towers, each with their own restrictions and requirements (Temples demand a settlement of at least 3 Huts; a Tower must be placed in a third-level tile).

The game has very simple rules, but the placement of tiles, the actions of expansion of the settlement and putting other buildings, allow for a good amount of depth and some strategy, mixed with a lot of tatical play, since you don't know which tile you will be using next.

There is direct interaction during play, since the addition of second and third level tiles can, and usually do, cover and take out Huts of other players, normally preventing them from being able to build a Temple. However, is unlike that the damage done is too harmful: is more often simply a bump in the road, a delay. as settlements can't be fully destroyed. Yet, as [thing=24508][/thing] is pretty tight, is possible that a small delay of one turn can mean losing the game. It is the nature of the thing: one mustn't losing opportunities.

The production value of this new printing is great: the tiles are thick, sturdy and colorful; the pieces are of wood and nice to the touch; the box is huge and keeps everything in place - but is a hassle to put everything back once the game is done.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
As per the description: each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.

Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.

The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main one is: where to put the tile drawn. This has several considerations: board state (the formation and what the others and you have on the board and where), what the player wants to do (expand to add more Huts, put a Temple or a Tower, block someone else, split a settlement, etc) and, finally, what she doesn't want to do (this is important, as laying a tile can be more useful to the others than to yourself, as they can use it to place tiles in the second or third level).

[thing=24508][/thing] usually requires forethought from the players: you are laying the foundations of your next plays right now. This isn't a complex and intricate demand, but sure carries weight and is key to doing well.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good production value;
- Language independent;
- Easy to teach and to play, but with a good amount of depth in the gameplay;
- Tight game, with the decision often coming in the final round (and this is a game that can end early, not with a predefined number of rounds);
- Constant interaction and fight for space - the destruction of Huts isn't, normally, crippling or too harmful;
- Short playing time with a good pacing and little downtime;
- Is nice too see the evolution of the board, growing and rising, dotted with buildings.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Mostly abstract gameplay.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like playing a little more complex version of [thing=822][/thing]: [thing=24508][/thing] has more types of things to add (three or four types of buildings), more ways to place tiles (in three levels), and is more agressive, but the heart of it is the same: lay tiles and put stuff on them. There is no cost to this, no economy - at the most a small amout of resource management: with meeples and Huts (though finishing the Huts can be good, is also very possible to not be able to build in one of the next turns and be eliminated). It is hard for someone that enjoys [thing=822][/thing] to be displeased by [thing=24508][/thing].

Overall, [thing=24508][/thing] offers a fine mix of simple rules, good depth, a nice amount of interaction, and a lively pacing, with short downtime, all put in a pretty to look at and handle package.

Meh.  Not too  much of interest here.  It's ok but would rather play the similarly themed, but more complex, Java instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tile-laying beauty. This is such a wonderfully elegant abstract with a great tactile side to it as well. Thick cardboard tiles that also serves the purpose of making it easy to judge the level of the terrain, three different kinds of wooden buildings you need to place. It is a nice feeling building the island and you can look at end product with a satisfaction of having built it. Plenty of tactical play and dicker in the game. I like the control you have in a two-player game. Only downside is that it does not seem to reward mastering the game much.

Expansion: Taluva Extension.

Very open-ended game. At first it was weird trying to figure out what to do and why, in terms of strategy. It's the kind of game that says to you: "Here's how you win. Go." And that's it. Definitely rewards repeated play. Taluva is going to give an advantage to spatial thinkers, and will probably turn off those who avoid such games.

the quality of the game is impressive, and this is one of those "plays quick but plays deep" kind. like, Carcassonne for hard cores. I respect the game an awful lot (all this is after 1 play) but not sure how quick I would replay it myself...too thinky.

reminds me of shear panic--a good looking high quality "quick" game that is actually an abstract with a lot of thinking. the game we played was very quiet and intense.

I play this game like I play Carcassonne, against the same opponent every time, and it's become a real tussle. The games have become extremely close. We have noticed that it's invariably the start player who wins (in games between the two of us). It doesn't take up much space, so we can take it along to a coffee shop and play it there. That's not a bad way to spend an afternoon at all.

This must be one of the prettiest abstracts out there. The end result of any game is just plain gorgeous!

I am a fan of Merkle's design and Attika is an old favorite of mine. However, Taluva really fell flat for me. The game play was plain and as my partner commented "needlessly complicated". While the game play is not complex, something does not feel right.It feels like you have many options for tile play but when it comes down to placement of buildings, it is really tough to prevent your opponent from placing or building their pieces since they get a fresh tile placement every turn. This means that you can agonize about how to destroy your opponent's moves or block their placement, but it is really hard to do that without sacrificing your turn. This means that the game has a very solitaire feel to it and it is just a race to the end to see who finishes first. Not really very enticing for me. A pass for me.

7/2016:6
There is an elegance to the game, but also a certain amount of cuthroatness to it. I have reacquired, replayed and then sold off the game again, twice around. After my initial sale, I thought perhaps I made a mistake. The game should appeal to me: the simple Knizia-esque ruleset, the strong spatial tile-placing elements and a highly acclaimed designer whose previous designs I thoroughly enjoyed.  While I didn't dislike the game, I wasn't exactly moved by it. Player who enjoy the slow buildup felt frustrated often by more aggressive players who constantly sought to take advantage of tile placement to destroy villages. While this can indeed be attributed to clever or superior play, it clearly destroyed the fun for some players who couldn't maintain presence on the board. This feature will be a turn off for some and a turn on for others. Getting the correct group to play this game will be crucial for all around enjoyment.

It sort of feels like Carcassone plus volcanoes equals Taluva.  Not that that's a bad thing; I think that Taluva represents a new and interesting direction for groups who like tile laying games but for whom Carcassone has worn out its welcome.

I really like how the game-end condition is in the hands of the players and that their is a clearly defined long-term strategic element (which types of buildings will you try to build) and a host of short-term tactical elements (where to place your tiles, to try to build your buildings or prevent your opponents from doing the same, etc.) that have to be taken into consideration if you want to be able to accomplish your strategic goals.

Last but not least, the theme in Taluva is great and it is incorporated into the mechanics (volcanoes anyone?) seamlessly.

An interesting tri-hex tile-laying game...very attractive to look at as you build the 3D island.  Still developing my strategy, but I can see some strategic depth. It's a really good game, but my wife isn't crazy about it and we have other games that fill a similar niche...so on the trading block it goes.  I think I'll miss this one though....

Colonize the pacific island of Taluva as volcanic activity causes it to rise out of the sea. Unique tile-laying game where tiles can be added above one another creating elevation.

C'est supposé être un super jeu abstrait de placement de tuiles. Mais le thème est inutile. C'est n'importe quoi. Une mécanique originale en 3D car on monte en hauteur avec les tuiles.

A pleasant surprise.  I eschew most tile-laying titles as too light, but this game has just enough to satisfy me.  While [gameid=822] fails to hold my attention or offer enough choices, Taluva offers strategic and tactical flexibility.  The variable endpoint makes the game much more tense, in my estimation. You can hamper other players, but you have to be careful, because it may ultimately help them by giving them more space to expand.  It's clever that way.  This game adapts well to the playstyle of the group, which is great for both gaming with your most cutthroat get-together, or as a lighter endeavor with some more casual-minded friends.

One play so far. I was a bit disappointed with game play.  The game is beautiful, the tiles are gorgeous and the bits are fantastic.  Tile placement is one of my favorite mechanisms so I had high hopes that this would be a really good game.  In our play it seemed a bit flat to me.  There is a height mechanism that reminds me of Java a bit.  I would play this again but my guess is that this will remain a pretty average game for me.

It's wonderful and beautiful :) the volcano looks astonishing! purely strategic. unfortunately, my co-players don't see that in it and I have to play... alone. but this game allows this mode. I can master my tactics however don't know against whom... ;)

RATING: 5
This is another "race game disguised as another sort of game" game, and I'm not keen on race games overall.  I just don't like that there's only one winner, and that the other players don't even place in the overall competition.  That being said, it's not a bad game.  The building rules mesh well with the tile-laying part of the game, and while it's not the most thrilling game you'll ever play, you can get a nice feeling of gentle competition from it.  I can see it being a good family game.

Visually very nice - I like the geography/topography and how it develops. Good with 3 players, a bit tame with 2.

Tile placement. Very pretty [geekurl=/image/1441006/taluva](now with new box art)[/geekurl]. Hopefully the new publisher Ferti is maintaining the component quality as the original game. 
Simple rules; easy learning-curve; complex play.
Although it seems that the safest place for a village is in a deep valley between two volcanos...

A beautiful cerebral abstract tile-laying game with an island theme. You place huts and try to place temples (near 3 or your occupied spaces) or towers (at a height of 3). You can either go for most temples followed by most towers, or you can try to run out of two of your components.

Completely abstract, and I've no idea where some people are coming from with these "light/middleweight" remarks.  This is a brain burner! I'm glad for that, but it isn't what I was expecting.  A bit disappointed that the terrain types don't figure more prominently into the decision space.

An abstract brain-burner with lots of spatial placement. The bits are amazing - thick cardboard triple hexes with beautiful, distinctive terrains,  and the wooden structures are also unique - no wooden houses here!  I really like how you get to stack the pieces and build actual 3D landscapes.  Underneath it all is a punishing abstract strategy game - the only random bit is the tile draw.

Un juego interesante y visualmente muy bonito.

Las primeras partidas parece algo soso, pero en cuanto le coges un poco la estrategia necesaria, la agresividad del juego aumenta enormemente y con ello la diversión.

A fairly clever take on a tile laying game.  However, I'm not sure if the game works very well, as I haven't been able to figure out from my play of the game yet whether you can really ever plan to put up towers, or if they get put up only when others make mistakes.  Also, it really isn't different enough from Carcassonne or Gheos to really merit a place in the collection.  Also, with two people, it is quick, but not particularly interesting.

RATING: N/A
Island building game in the style of Java, but a little lighter and more enjoyable. Just like in Java, you get a lot of freedom to do whatever you want. Maybe too much... Taluva is basically a race to see who needs the fewest turns to win. I'm not saying the game is bad: in fact I would take it over Java any day. I just don't really enjoy either of them.

It is beautiful and I like the 3D aspect of it. But for me I felt like everything I wanted to do could be done by opponent on his move, thus blocking me from doing it myself. If I want to pick an abstract game to put on the table, I don't think it will be this one.

A game that can't find a suitable audience in an era where the "abstract, or close to it" genre has largely been driven underground - perhaps permanently - by gamers with a craving for frothy fillers, thematic fantasy play, and victory point engineering.

Rules seems very complex about how you can place huts, towers and shrines around the map. Mechanics looks interesting. You are really building an island and watching vulcanos erupting.

Timothy Pinkham's "Brief Overview Series" video made me buy this game, and I am more than pleased! The game is very engaging, deep and fulfilling, while still moving at the speed of a power-filler. It feels kind of like YINSH in how easy the rules are, yet with very deep gameplay. I must also mention that the game is absolutely gorgeous!

I love this game more with each play, and must give in and rate it a perfect 10! Love it.

RATING: 8
The theme of building an island from an erupting volcano works well for a game that's abstract. There's plenty of strategy in Taluva but those who enjoy building for fun will like playing too. The rules are simple but there's quite a few of them to remember, making the first play a learning game. Fortunately the game plays quickly. The weak player in a multiplayer game can hand the win to an opponent but games are so short, it's a minor annoyance.

Quick to explain and play... deep abstractish feel... gorgeous components... scales well and a joy to play!  

I particularly like that while drawing certain tiles can be more or less helpful with a tribe expansion, most of the time you can make the play you want regardless of the terrain shown on the tile.  Finding positions where your tribes are safe and can expand the way you want them too is very engaging and covering you opponents (and occasionally yourself) in lava can get pleasantly vicious.

A first impression score, I don't know if I really didn't like the mechanics or I just haven't understood them fully.  I am willing to try again to see if the play experience improves.

Update #1: A slight increase (0.5) after a couple more sessions under my belt.  There is definitely a bit of strategy involved in Taluva than I first had thought.  I do feel that it seem to ends as soon as the board becomes interesting.  Still not fully convinced that it's as great of a game as Will think though, but I'm definitely not as adverse to playing this as before.

I liked this better than the first time I played, although in both games I didn't quite grasp the implications of my moves until about 2/3 of the way through the game.  Intriguing, and upon revisiting Taluva I'd like to play it more.  Always a good sign.

Underrated area control game.  If you can get past the name and ugly cover art, this is a great, simple, fast playing game.  The key to winning is balancing placing tiles to build settlements while at the same time blocking opponents from building temples and towers.  There's a lot more strategy in how you actually place a tile too because the location and orientation can reduce your vulnerability to having an opponent destroy some of your huts.  Can get nasty when your volcano messes up your opponent's settlement.

Nagyon hangulatos absztrakt játék, némi konfrontációval, de még bőven a tűréshatáron belül. 4 fős próba volt, de így is lement nagyon hamar, viszont megvannak a mélységei. Jó minőség, szép grafika, ajánlott darab.

A "megvannak a mélységei" az enyhe kifejezés. A gyk. 5 mondatban elmondható szabályok után akkora pofára esés jön, de természetesen jó értelemben, hiszen egyáltalán nem olyan egyszerű a dolog, mint ahogy kinéz.

After 10+ Plays: The first game in a long time that I went out and bought right after playing it.  The pieces are beautiful, and the mechanics are really interesting.  Just as in this designer's other game [gameid=8051] the direct player interaction and non-VP-oriented winning conditions are a nice change of pace from many of the other Euro's.  I really like how there is very little luck, even though it is a tile-laying game, because in essence all the tiles are the same except in regards to one of your action choices.  A win will usually come from good strategic planning, and not from drawing the right tile at the right time.

I love Lost Legacy, but so after playing only the Staff of Dragons deck, this set is much less fun.  There could be some interesting use of cards to swap in, but by its self, i did not find the Staff of Dragons even close to the same level as The Flying Garden ￼& The Starship.

I enjoyed Love Letter quite a bit and Lost Legacy is even better! I'll play any of the Lost Legacy sets anytime someone wants to! They're all really fun, but I think I'd rank them the same as the order in which they were released. This one being the second release means it's also my second favorite. The mechanics are still fairly easy to understand and explain, but it adds to variety and interest if you're starting to tire of the original 2 decks. I've mixed this one all together to make one big deck before and it works nicely. Haven't tried mixing decks from other sets yet...one step at a time!

Another fun version of Lost Legacy with two new flavors! 
I wasn't sure what the rules meant by "Trash", so we just set those aside, tapped, and didn't include them when adding up the totals for the Dragon cards. This means I'm not totally sure if I played it correctly, but it was fun!

Lost Legacy is Love Letter with decisions and game. Not sure yet which set I like best.

After finding the right group for this one It was great.  The  Dragons set was wacky and fun.  I like it more than love letter, but it isn't as light and therefore much less accessible to new gamers.

An improvement over Love Letter. There is some problem with player elimination, but less so in these two sets than elsewhere. I enjoy the plays that make it to the final guess more than those where players are knocked out early. A quick game with just enough strategy to keep it interesting.

I didn't love the original Lost Legacy; it just felt like Love Letter but less fun. But I rather enjoyed Lost Legacy: Binbo Tantei to Inbo no Shiro and Lost Legacy: Hyakunen Senso to Ryu no Miko. They seem to play much better 2p than Love Letter does and they expand the game system in some interesting ways.

Not quite as good as the original, but these decks do both add new strategies.

I enjoy this separately from AEG's version of Love Letter. The twist in game winning conditions and card powers make for a completely different game. The artwork is also amazing!

A 'Love Letter' deduction variant of sorts with a fantasy theme (Vorpal Sword, Dragons!).

A single card is set aside face down as the ruins. Players start with a single card, draw one and play one card each turn. Card effects happen. Rinse and repeat. If all but one player is left, said player wins.

Otherwise, if the draw deck runs out, the 'investigation' phase begins. The player with the lowest number gets to guess where the number 5 card is (in someone's hand or in the ruins pile). Guess wrongly and it's on to the next player. Player who gets the guess right wins.

Fun, with a little more meat to it than Love Letter but loses some elegance in the process.

With 2 players the game is easier to control, and there's actually less chaos. With more players: it's harder trying to count and track cards.

Plus points: comes with 32 cards in the deck. Essentially two different sets of cards that can be played alone or mixed. Or combined for even more player chaos!

Take Love Letter and change the focus from holding the highest card at the end to trying to know where a certain card is and you have Lost Legacy. For more fun include two different sets of sixteen cards and the ability to mix and match cards to make your own customization.

If you're trying to figure out what this stuff is in English once AEG releases it, this set will be Chronicle 2. Welcome to 2013, North America!

This is my least favourite of the Lost Legacy sets with instant eliminations, lots more elimination and very little in the way of actual deduction. Just a bit shit.

See my review for Lost Legacy below.

Thus far with two plays, the consensus is that Lost Legacy does not measure up to Love Letter. While game play is relatively similar, the "novel" elements of Lost Legacy with the extra end-of-game deduction step and the ruins felt redundant. It is entirely possible that since the cards remain unique and players are not familiar with the card powers, the subtle strategies are not yet evident. Then again, this is a 10 minute, 16 card game and the strategies shouldn't really be that tough to tease apart. While I am less vocal about my opposition for the game, I can see why folks prefer Love Letter. The verdict is still out there and repeated plays are necessary before a final conclusion can be drawn.


Note: Having extra cards in the ruins is a little odd. Especially if you know Lost Legacy is in the ruins but have to guess which card is actually the Lost Legacy. Just pure dumb luck for having picked the right card?

Decks (#3) The Vorpal Sword, and (#4) The Staff of Dragons.

I love how in this Lost Legacy set they didn't just give you two decks of 16 cards, but also two variant setups combining the two decks.

I'm just as thrilled with Lost Legacy as I originally was with Love Letter, but Lost Legacy is more satisfying to my gamer needs. I can tweak decks to get different versions of gameplay, and even then each of the six decks which I own play differently. I just love Lost Legacy!

The Lost Legacy series is basically an evolution of Love Letter. They both feature 16 cards (per game, but in the former you can play with more cards to accommodate more players), and similar mechanisms: hand size of one card, draw one, play one, and discard openly in front of yourself.

The difference is that Lost Legacy has become even more of a deduction game. If the deck runs out, you take turns, in ascending hand card order, to guess where the Lost Legacy card is in the game. This can include a new area called the Ruins, which starts as one card off the top of the deck during setup, but can grow from there during play.

The additional deduction aspect is great. I love this game so much, it is now firmly cemented in my top ten games of all time. However, this is just the introduction to the system for me, the decks keep getting better. Decks five, and six are incredible! Please give this a try.

Deck (#3) The Vorpal Sword is good with 2-4 players, while deck (#4) The Staff of Dragons isn't fun at all with only 2 players, but works well with 3-4 players.

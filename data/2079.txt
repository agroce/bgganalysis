Rulebook is poorly written, with excessive errata.

I really wanted to like this game, but playing it was an exercise in frustration.  You need to constantly flip back and forth through the rulebook. I knew I couldn't take it anymore when I decided to go nuclear and prayed to roll a 1, 2, or 3 to end it all.

Solid treatment of a hypothetical land war in Germany in the 80's. For wargamers, the rules pretty straightforward and handles a number of awkward weapons and operations (airstrikes, chemical and nuclear weapons, axis of advance) in a straightforward manner.

RATING: 6
Good enough as a light simulation, but NATO's best
chance in this game is to go nuclear on turn 2. They
will never have anything like a 50/50 chance if they 
allow the Warsaw Pact to advance much. If they do go 
nuclear, it's essentially over - either they lose 
immediately, or so degrade the WP's offensive capability
that the game is over. If you're into the gameplay (as
opposed to exploring what the incursion will look like),
don't bother setting it up - just roll a die at the beginning.
The outcome is preordained otherwise.

Using a bidding option (and removing the nuclear) would solve this issue - but then
the game would encourage play which does not match NATO
doctrine. The NATO player would be able to fall back further
than plans allowed. 

VPs system discourages use of Soviet chemical attacks,
which is my biggest gripe about it as a simulation. It is
also possible to obtain silly airspace results. Interesting,
but these little issues taken together have always soured
me on the design.

Agreed - this game is dated.  However, its treatment of operational-level NATO vs. Warsaw Pact actions in central Germany is comprehensive.  Abstracted to just the right level for its scale, it may not give you a feel for the tactical battlefield, but it gives you an idea of how Corps-level and above combat would have happened had World War III started here.

Let a co-worker borrow this once in hopes I could get it on the table, and it came back without the rule book.  It's why today I am a bit like Scrooge when it comes to sharing my games even though that attitude doesn't really help with getting to play them with others.

Not that NATO was that great of a game either, and I am sure that the ratings on the units would annoy me today its just that I can't replace it reasonably and I never played it.  So its this gamers true WHAT IF/WHAT IF.i.e.what if I could play the 'What If 'Warsaw Pact & NATO duked it out in the mid=80's game.

I had to bump up my rating after thinking about my experiences with it. Very nice game with high quality comnponents. Focuses on the ground conflict only all air/sea actions are highly abstrated.

Why does every WWIII game have the Soviets invading the West? In reality, it was the West (the US) that was more likely going to start the war. 

These games are all a bit of Reagan wet dreams (see VP's game on Nicaragua).

I love this game. It makes a major operational campaign with air and sea power elements actually playable and fun. Have played a number of times both two-player and solitaire. Yes - nuclear winters have often resulted, but then that was a very possible outcome had such a war actually broken out (thank goodness it never did!)

I have played this game twice, prior to logging plays on BGG.

RATING: 7
An interesting and detailed account of 80's WW3 in Europe, this colorful wargame comes across at first as being rather unconventional (nukes, chemical weapons, etc.) but under the hood it is actually fairly conventional. 

There are twenty something phases per turn, giving the game a very process-driven turn sequence, much like other complex games of the era (Advanced 3rd Reich comes to mind). 

NATO is not overly complex, but all the types of movement take a while to get a grip on. There are tactical and strategic road movement, airborne, air ferry, amphibious transport, sea ferry, rail movement, helicopter transport- each with their own set of rules and criteria for use. But when all is said and done, it's only a midweight game in terms of complexity, the movement rules being the only thing that slowed my learning.

There are some nice bits of chrome- refugees clogging roads, NATO Border Troops adjacent to the Iron Curtain- that really add to the theme and gameplay, while taking little toll in additional rules weight.

I least like the ludicrous nuke rules. Declare tactical nuclear war, and roll a die. On a 1-3, you automatically suffer a decisive defeat! Game over- you lost. Sure, this is a deterant, but perhaps a victory point cost would have been better. Bringing 16 turns of careful maneuver down to a heads-or-tails coin flip feels sadly random, anticlimatic, and silly.

Still, there is still a lot to like here. Fans of cold war era wargames will certainly not be disappointed. This game is just a lot of fun. Three scenarios (along with a long and short version of each) provide some nice replay. Once the convoluted turn sequence and movement rules sink in, it plays fairly quickly and smoothly, with only occasional rules referencing necessary.

The first adult level wargame I bought, back in the 90's at the tail end of the classic era of wargaming. It was half off from a gaming store that was dying when the hobby seemed to be dying as well. 
Saved lunch money from school for a couple weeks to snag it. Still play it periodically, very good game.

Victory Games' best selling wargame and an excellent game as a game. I was the art director on the cover for this game, and bought the cover photograph from one of Manhattan's great stock photography companies, and I still brag about this cover to this day. I am convinced that the packaging, price, and total value of this game represents an ideal in wargames, back in the day, and perhaps even now.

Tough, convoluted game.  Although the concept is good and I really wanted to like this game, the play is disjointed and too complicated.  Rules are poorly written requiring constant referencing and backtracking as they are filled with exceptions to the exception to the exception and scattered everywhere.  All this rule referencing has the effect of slowing play down to almost a crawl.  Great concept, but overall the game falls apart in the execution.

-------Break Break----

After giving this another chance I'm liking the game much more. The rules aren't as complex as I originally thought and with the errata make play much more manageable. I will play this again if given the opportunity.

I bought this way back when (1989) and didn't much care for it.  Hated the absracted air rules, but maybe that was because I was already hooked on The Third World War series by GDW

RATING: 8
Very Good: Operational - Modern - Easy/Medium

Plus:
-Great theme
-Innovative system that works very well
-Clear rules
-Nice map
-Evocative; chemical warfare, tactical nuclear weapons all is there

Minus:
-Odds favor Nato imo; without chemical weapons the Pactdoes not have a chance.
-Counter quality so, so. You need a loop to see info.
-NATO panzer divisions have same strength as soviet panzer division but were in fact twice the size...despite this the odds still favors NATO...

The good old 80's....I wish I could go back to them! I wish as well this game was slightly more balanced as it is fairly impossible to win as the Warsaw Pact.
This game depictes the good old days NATO vs. Soviet in Europe. Detailed yet very playable. Got the hang of it after playing twice. It plays relatively quick once set up is done. I like setting up games so there is no issue.

The only issues I faced playing the game were the weak Soviet forces / counter quality. I never managed a conventional win and to stand a chance, chemical warfare is a must by the pact. It takes a while to cross the border and no real suprises are possible for the Russian player and when trying to penetrate. 
Allied forces or reinforcements can reinforce the good defensive ground fairly easily. Will set up another game soon with some good old 80's music at the background.

Detailed, not too difficult, great 80's topic but replayability value is average as options are limited and NATO forces relatively strong. Game system is innovative and works very well.

RATING: 1
Seems amusingly out-of-date now, but who could have foreseen the fall of the Berlin Wall? Not a bad fantasy simulation of a general war in Germany in the 1980s. However, it suffers from two problems. First, the air rules have been abstracted to the point that they're counter-intuitive. The second problem is more serious. As soon as the Soviet side uses chemical weapons (and they will), the NATO player must go nuclear or lose the game. Once the nukes fly, it's a 50-50 chance that the world will be destroyed and life as we know it ends. Whoever opened the nuclear Pandora's box first loses a moral victory. EVERY game I played ended this way -- like in that stupid Matthew Broderick film, Wargames! Ugh!

Want to play the quick version of NATO? Flip a coin: Heads and NATO loses (and the world is destroyed), Tails and NATO wins (and the earth is safe). Some game! Sold it in 1991...

Good scale and presentation, somewhat too complex for a hypothetical war, good detail, bit some dubious assumptions, and a particularly serious flaw when it comes to the use of nukes (by which I mean that you can be getting your ass totally kicked, and then suddenly win the game at the end by converting it into a nuclear exchange).

Against general reports about this game ,I bought this game in 2007. I strongly recommend this game due to several reasons:
-Rules are really simple. So one could easily convince a friend to learn & play and avoid playing solitaire.
-Only 1 mapsheet.
-Offers a variety of strategies for each side, with plenty of smart options to provide extra punch for own offensives or damage your contender options before he hurts you. I was really surprised to see all of them allowed with such a simple rulebook.
-Nice simplification of air power, while giving both players something to worry about.
-Colourful counters.
-Highly replayable and enjoyable.

Played this game quite a few time in '83/'84.  I thought the refugee factor--which hindered unit movement on roads--was a great mechanic.  I wanted more tactical nukes--but this ultimately led to endgame with the world going Global Thermal Nuclear War when this is really about conventional war.  Now, this game seems really dated but at the time, was a good hex & counter game in the '80s.

Decent 'Pact vs NATO effort. Gets the full Victory Games treatment with the great looking components. I particularly like the color-coding of the symbols that indicate unit id's, (combat bonuses for unit cohesion). Playing without the chemicals or nukes, (for playability sake), it seemed that a draw was the unavoidable conclusion. Not so interested after that. And GDW's Third World War series knocked this one off the shelf, permanently. No regrets playing this one, though.

RATING: 8
As a growing child during the Cold War, the confrontation between the East and the West is still something of a cult and mystery which deeply attract me.  I find everything about Cold War fascinating and therefore perhaps I rated it a little bit higher than others who evalute this game purely from the angle of gameplay.  The hard and soft factors of the modern military units are integrated into the combat design, to a degree that reflects the major military theory in the 70's and the early 80's.  The game has many nations to participate in a hypothetical war broken out in Germany.  The Cold War is now over, but the Cold War enigma still tainted in my mind. I do not know why this game just got an average below 6, generally not received well by the players.  But I think it is a game full of charisma as compared to other NATO games.

While the components are certainly a product of the 80s and although you may take some exception to the designer's rationale on various things (chemical warfare, German units rated higher than U.S. ones, airpower, etc.), this is a good game worth playing.  The three scenarios offer quite a bit of game play and it was good to relive the WWIII gaming days when I was a lot younger!

Man, this is still some really great stuff. The game always presents a strong narrative and there's just so much packed so well into the design.

Extra half point for the nuke rules, which I think are brilliant. Played strictly, they break the frame of the game by forcing the player to gamble everything--not least the time already invested in setting up and playing--on a coin toss. No modifiers, just a straight up odds or evens. Having to pack up and put away a game prematurely is probably the only kind of deterant a wargamer can understand.

Anecdote: I once used NATO to generate a detailed World War III scenario for a term paper in my high school social studies class. I got the paper back with an "F" because the teacher thought I had copied it from somewhere. So I brought the game in, laid it out and explained how it worked, and got the paper back the next day with an "A." My first AAR. :-)

Game has a fatal flaw: Nuke will always be used if the need arises, which it usually does, and then the game ends one way or another, making everything you played up to then pointless.

Heretical, but I prefer this to Third World War, mainly because it plays much faster. In TTW, formations take ages to kill off, particularly as they get to regroup when out of combat. TTW has the best air rules though.

Pretty straightforward game, apart from the horrible airspace/supply rules, which confuse most players.

Played it once by now and found it a little bit disappointing. Some rules are rather strange (like the way the first turn is played or the supply ones).
I had more fun with Third Wold War Battle for Germany (GDW).
Thus, I would give it another try if I can.

I consider this game WW3 on the cheap and easy.  The components are nothing special, but simple and effective (NATO icons).  The rules are very clear & easy to understand and include some effective player aids.  Game play is not overly complex even thought the sequence of play looks a bit long, and ran smooth and fairly quick once you've been thru it once or twice.  There are not lots of variants or extra details on the rules to add flavor, but overall this game conveys a good play of WW3 at the division level.  I think my only major complaint is that the OB seems a bit dated (i.e. the research captures more late-70s NATO capabilities rather than the mid to late-80s the game is supposed to cover) with relatively weak US units and NATO airpower.  One word of advice for the WP player - use chemical warfare and use it lots!

A very exciting game on perhaps the most interesting and plausible of past hypothetical wars. Terrain and river hexsides are absolutely crucial to a good NATO defense. A coin-flip automatic loss rule keeps both sides from resorting to nukes until it is absolutely necessary to avoid defeat. This gives the dilemma considerable weight and tension.

RATING: N/A
Operational level simulation of potential NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict in Central Europe. Designed to be played in one sitting, NATO combines ease of play with a sophisticated integrated system of unit differentiation, command and supply structure, air power, force projection, chemical warfare, and tactical nuclear warfare.

A "quick" WWIII in Europe game.  The quickness means simplification of the game system.  Good for playing in one (or maybe 2) sessions.

This was the 1st Victory Games game I played. I liked the complexity level (low), but didn't like the huge amount of record-keeping involved.  Reminded me of some of the yaquinto games--I liked 'em, but too many charts to keep up with.

Since I got it as part of a bundle and it wound up costing me $1.25 -It's a great game!  I had to reproduce some missing counters, but once done I did get one play in, and it was a fun and interesting game - a keeper.

It's not a time period I have any particular interest in, better put, I'm more interested in other periods.  This period stuff always make me think of Tom Clancey, and I don't care one bit for Clancey or his work.  Despite my bias, this game comes across very well.

RATING: 7
looking for an opponent - Good representation but can fall down with the soviets capturing the US air-landing reforger sites too easy. This really limits the US re-enforcements and is an obvious implied objective for the Soviets to win the game.  Otherwise excellent and a good scrap with some hard thinking to be done.  A easy set of rules to get playing so most of the thinking is on the game and not the rules but lots of challenges nonetheless as NATO desperately tries to hold on for the yanks to arrive.  Give 3 different start-states, Strategic suprise (like custers last stand for the NATO player, tactic suprise and NATO at the ready (v.difficult for the Soviet player)  great game

I have fond memories of my first game of this. My opponent insisted on rolling for the situation even though I suggested we start more simply with an even situation. He played NATO and rolled the complete surprise situation. The free world ended that game, lol. Also the Soviet marines single handedly took over one of the 'Low Countries'!

If you're familiar with such wargames, it can be a lot of fun.  Many complain about its being "dated."  Well, of course.  It's a fine simulation of a war that never happened.  Think of it like old-time science fiction: Heinlein or Asimov.  Just because it didn't happen doesn't mean you can't enjoy simulating it.

If only the airspace rules made any kind of sense . . .

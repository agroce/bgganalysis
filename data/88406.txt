"Space [thing=5206][/thing]" in a solitaire format.  A tight design because your fleet is composed of a variety of ships with various strengths and weaknesses.  If you move, you cannot fire that turn, nor can you be hit because you are warping around the screen.  You have to think carefully in how you coordinate your units.  Crazy fun and challenging without being impossible.

This is the best spirit of the old microgame, but vastly improved.

The idea of the Titans being a computer AI fits well with the card idea of play. The rules are set out well enough to play and learn at the same time. The first time play through for me was great. That is a big deal for me with any game I get. If it is bugger to set up, learn and play on the first game, then  I tend to rate it down a bit. A great game that I will constantly revise the score to as I play more scenarios.

I've played several games of Astra Titanus already and I think it's excellent. The game comes with 8 different scenarios (9 if you were within the first 50 people to buy the game), and i'm sure even more scenarios will be released in future expansions. It will take quite a while to finish the initial group of scenarios though. They're quite a challenge. 

There are also some scenarios which use asteroid fields, and they change the map every time you play. Even if you only played the game until you beat all 8 of the scenarios just once, it would provide many hours of entertainment, and would be well worth the price.

Astra Titanus is OK - for a solitaire game.  There's not a lot of room for strategy - basically you just throw all your ships at the alien supership at once, and hope you kill it before it wipes you out.  I always think how cool it would be to have something to play alone, but it never works out that way.  Although I kind of enjoy AT, I have learned that games are for socializing, and that solitaire games suck for that.

stop the giant ship with your fleet. THis game seemed to have very limited mileage to me. Once you've come up with a reasonably sucessful strategy you don't have to radically change it to much for each scenario. it just becomes a case of tactical position of your ships for max damage/min risk. As with many VP games, the production values are terrible.

RATING: 6
Super-simple space shooter game. Your ships warp around the board while a lumbering, behemoth Titan makes its way to it's target. You keep trying to hit and destroy the Titan before it blows up the target. Solitaire play is handled by cards that dictate how the Titan will move and attack that turn. It's fun to play, feels like a very light Starfleet Battles, but the Titan is unfortunately too stupid: you feel like an ant trying to push a bowling ball.

RATING: 9
This is a fantastic game. I bit my tongue a bit when buying it because of the components (which are attractive but sub-par in terms of quality) and the price (which is high for the components you get), but I'm very glad I didn't let that stop me from picking it up.

I love sci-fi and I was after a relatively short game where you control capital ships during fleet actions, and AT delivers exactly that. The premise is excellent, the little touches that imply the nature of the AT universe -- like TDF ships only moving using jump drives during battle -- and the core mechanics of the game itself are all excellent.

It's tense, too. My first time out, I lost a few ships right off the bat before I got my feet under me, and the Titans are terrifying. Surprisingly, it tells a story as well; I wasn't expecting that. When the Titan devastated Starbase Tau, I thought about all of the people that had just been wiped out; ditto when it destroyed my ships.

This is only my second solitaire game (Arkham Horror was my first), and it's every bit as good an introduction to that mode of play as I'd hoped. And in play, the component quality fades into the background, too.

05-Nov-2016:  This is a light, solo wargame with a cool, interesting sci-fi theme.  The player controls the TDF (Terren Defense Force) and must defend against one (or more) Titans...very large, very powerful alien war machines.  There are several scenarios in the game that offer differing starting positions for both the player and the Titan.  The rules tweaks for each scenario really add to the theme of the game, giving each one a different feel.

With a reasonably simple ruleset, the game provides a solid challenge and a great narrative flow.  So far, I've only played the first two scenarios, but they each presented a different experience and story to tell.  The Titan is controlled by a small deck of cards that shows movement and attack priority for each of its weapons.  There are four different types of Titans in the game with an additional one (and new scenario) available in the files section.

This is an excellent addition to the collection for sci-fi fans looking to try out something in the wargame genre or for others wanting something quicker and lighter than the bigger wargames out there.  It plays in well under an hour without much rules overhead.  There are plenty of dice rolls here, but thus far I don't feel luck the game is too luck-based.  It just adds to the story.

The designer has written on this listing that he intends to rewrite the rule book. Good: it's underwritten, under-illustrated, and leaves much unexplained or ambiguous. The design itself is okay, and is solitaire-friendly--big, bad spaceship comes through your sector of the galaxy and your many, puny ships try to stop it. If that idea appeals to you, then this game works. Acquired August, 2012. Sold, December 2012.

I really like the theme and the titans. The mechanism for slowing the titans down and their different weapons is interesting. I found, though, that this is a game where the winning strategy is pretty obvious, but the hard part is executing it perfectly. And with the variation ships being just a matter of hit points or damage rolls, it didn't feel like losing any particular ship was a big deal.

AT is a very well done game.  The card AI helps organize solo play and the rules are well thought out.  Far from just an OGRE clone (but close enough to scratch the itch), it presents unique game play that's fun.  The FTL jump phase and trying to outguess where the Titan is going next is brilliant and maddening at the same time.

A really nicely done solo game.  The titan behaves randomly but not stupidly.  The humans have lots of tactical choices and tradeoffs, and even some strategic variations for how to plan their defense.  The system is easy to execute quickly without too much fiddly stuff.

update:  unfortunately, not all scenarios are as awesome.  The harder titans end up being just more random and reduce the viable strategies you can use.  And there is more massing ships then rolling lots of dice one-by-one (for both sides) as a result. I preferred the first scenario, where attacking in waves made sense, and you had some strategic choices about where to hit the enemy.

2012-01-16: Thanks, Secret Santa! :)

Fun solitaire sf wargame. It has a nice retro sf feel like Steve Jackson's Ogre (an obvious inspiration), but with Saberhagen-style berserkers in space instead of Laumer-style bolos on land.

The rules are fairly short and simple but unfortunately have some unclear places and errors; be sure to download the FAQ ( http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/63672/faq-for-astra-titanusunofficial )

As a solitaire game it starts to feel repetitive in terms of strategy and tactics, but I still took about 30 plays before completing all 8 scenarios successfully, so I certainly got a lot of play out of it! I expect I'll still bring it out occasionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Here's what I think based on 5 plays of S1 and S2.

[b]What I like[/b]

:d10-1: This is subjective, but I like the theme. A fleet of human space ships making an apparently hopeless stand to save humanity against a massive and insanely powerful alien space ship.

:d10-2: AT has a small footprint, both on the table and on your shelf. Most of my games, like all but three others, are in boxes and take up lots of shelf space. I'm kind of a snob that way. However, this takes up virtually no space on my game shelves. I could have hundreds of games if they were all this size. It also doesn't require much table space. It's easy to set up on a small, firm board and then store "ready to go" on a shelf.

:d10-3: The challenge. It's brutal. At least in the four games I've played. I lose many, many ships. Sometimes I lose them abruptly to the intense and devastating fire from the Titan. Once I lost all of my ships. The enemy really feels like a massive beast compared and my ships feel tiny and insignificant.

:d10-4: The rules are short and for the most part easy to understand. You'll have a few questions as you play your first couple games that you'll need to look at the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Astra_Titanus_FAQ#]FAQ[/url] or scour the rules forum to answer. The designer seems to be very involved and quick to respond.

:d10-5: I really like the movement mechanic. The Titan moves through each space and its move is governed by a random card draw and the state of its Drive System, which can be reduced by successful attacks. The TDF units move my jumping their ships and pass through spaces between their start and end spaces. The catch is they must move at least half of their movement points, so they don't get to make fine adjustments if the Titan made an unanticipated move. But they can move to any space between minimum and maximum range once they commit to a move. The other catch is that TDF ships must commit to a move before the player knows where the Titan will move. So there is a great deal of uncertainty when you are deciding which ships to move.

:d10-6: Combat is fun because the Titan has four different systems that the player can target. Each weapon system has its own unique attack, range, and defense rating. And the defense ratings are different among the various Titan models. As the Titan takes hits, its capability will be degraded resulting in fewer attacks and a slower speed. Some TDF ships may carry missiles which attack the Titan separately from the standard TDF attacks. They can also be destroyed by the Titan, so maneuvering ships to get an ideal shot without being destroyed before launching adds another tactical element to the game. And the Titan, well, it puts out a lot of devastating firepower until you can start applying some damage.

:d10-7: So far the game plays very quickly, at least on the first couple scenarios. I like that as I tend to play many long campaign style games.

:d10-8: I see a lot of replayability within this small game. It comes with eight scenarios and while each scenario has a fairly scripted setup, some variation or randomization is present to allow flexibility from the beginning. There is also enough randomization between the card draws and die rolls that the game should play out differently each time, even if the player uses the same general tactics.

[b]What could be better?[/b]

:d6-1: The rules leave a few situations ambiguous or unaddressed. The answers are readily available here on BGG in the rules forum or on the FAQ. So not a big concern.

:d6-2: The counters are small, I think 1/2" at the biggest with the missile counters being smaller. The map is thin paper so you'll want to exercise a little more care with it than a mounted map, but it works fine. And it helps give the game a smaller footprint and cheaper cost. They are nothing to complain about and are certainly serviceable, but it's something to be aware of if you really like to grade components. I believe there will be a significant improvement once this game gets the Gold Banner treatment.

:d6-3: Probably the most important minor concern for me is that in a couple of my admittedly "too few" games thus far, it's felt like I haven't had a chance. My units have been obliterated by game end and defeat was all but certain early on. It's still fun to play out, though it's been slightly frustrating to realize I had no hope from the beginning. Most of this I'm sure is do to learning the game and being ignorant of effective strategy which should come over time. Luck does play a big part with the card draws and die rolls but right now I blame my newness. This is definitely not a game that a player can win all of the time, and I will expect to lose frequently. I just hope I get better so I feel I have a slim chance most of the time at least.

[b]In Summary[/b]

Astra Titanus is a quick playing and pretty easy to learn game that involves tactical maneuver and asymmetric forces to resolved a solitaire conflict in space. There are many meaningful decisions to make regarding when and where to move your ships, how to attack the Titan and what systems to target, and when to jump damaged ships away to attempt repairs. I don't have any serious problems with this game and I foresee myself enjoying it long into the future. As such, I think it is available at a very reasonable price.

[b]Who might like this game?[/b] 

Sci-fi fans, wargamers, solitaire gamers, those who like narrative creation, and those who like challenge and don't mind losing.

[b]Who stay away?[/b]

Those who like to or need to win frequently. Anyone not interested in a combination of sci-fi, wargaming, and tactical maneuver.

Very enjoyable solo game that is not too hard and not too long. Production value is of a good PnP.

You will get a lot more value out of Astra Titanus than most video games (and at a lot cheaper price!)

RATING: 6
early rating after a few sessions. got this as filler while i consider Space Empires 4x, which has been on my wishlist since forever. (i just know i may never have time to play it.) 

this is fine. the comparison to Ogre is right-on, although i find Astra Titanus' theme more compelling. it's a lot more fun to imagine some Borg-like technology coming to wreck your civilization and armadas of starships going out to stop it. 

Fleet space battles, love it! The storylines of Star Blazers, Macross, and Star Trek (Borg episodes). Love it!

component wise, the overall cost (with shipping) might seem a little high for what you get -- but having a small business, i understand the price-point. "hand-made" here is a matter of economies-of-scale, not so much the craftsmanship of components.

what matters is i'm having fun. what i like most is that it has a small footprint and it it plays quick enough to enjoy on a school night. (i plan on taking AT on an upcoming Disney vacation to play in the hotel while the kiddies sleep.) 

the physical size and game's scope fit neatly into my own gaming constraints. for that, i look forward to adding more of VPG's titles to my collection.

At first glance, not all that original: an homage to OGRE (in space), updated with cards to become a solitaire game.  Still, a neat idea and fun.  Will it be reverse-reverse-engineered to become a two-player game?  Will we see expansions, mirroring GEV/Shockwave/OGRE Battlefields?  Lots of potential.

But what do I think about it as it is now?  Rather fun, with a pretty good solitaire mechanic.  Not totally crazy about the defense fleet's jump movement, but it's still a good game.

Great solitaire game that allows you to make meaningful decisions (where to move your units, when to attack, what part of the titans do you attack) - while fighting that creeping sense of doom that engines of solo games typically have.

Re playability is fairly high - multiple scenarios and the variation in the Titan movement ensure it.

Component quality is below average - but so is the price - so in that sense is all worked out.

While I have enjoyed several Victory Point Games solitaire games, this one fell flat for me.  After 2 games, I still don't see many tactical decisions other than 1) try to position yourself within range of a Titan who will move before you can fire in a completely random direction and 2) decide what to aim for.

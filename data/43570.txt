I'm not sure what to think about this one just yet (and after nearly 20 plays!). Even at 18 plays I have not figured out the right strategy (just one win) so it is quite frustrating to play... yet I keep coming back. 

I had the same experience with Onirim, except that after 10 plays (almost all losses) I figured it out and now I win that game most of the time. Onirim is quite relaxing to play, and I can get in a quick game in 10 minutes. I haven't quite got there yet with Friday. I have a little more time until Hostage Negotiator arrives from KS, and then I might be retiring this game. We'll see.

It is hard to get the rules right because cards have a lot of specail abilities and its hard to play them in a right way. Also its unclear when you are allowed to use something and when this is not allowed. 

I am not shore if I play the game in a right way even though I have seen many youtube videos and read the rule book. This game seems to HARD to win at least in the way that I play it.

A mecânica do jogo é original e elegante. O tema é bem divertido e nada infantilizado. A curva de aprendizado é difícil e nos conflitos maiores a quantidade de cartas na mesa e a influência das cartas umas nas outras tornam o jogo um campo minado pra errar regras.

Although it has a fun theme, it misses it by having you literally want to lose early to gain the ability to thin your deck - a common strategy in deck builders. The combos on the cards are not great in my opinion - something needed to make this game pop more. So in the end and after a single play, I'm not really willing to explore it more.

(Solo)
3/20/13 - First play. Fast light game. Lost in Red phase on my first play, so I didn't do too bad. Good Deck management game. It can be played solo, (only) it's quick, it's easy. It is tough, but I don't mind a challenge now and then. I'll give it a few more plays before I pass final judgement.

4/3/2013 - 5th play and first win. While difficult, this game is addictive. It's easy to set up and tear down, plays fast, and is fun. I find myself thinking about it even when not playing. I just wish the theme was more interesting. I really think this system would lend itself well to sci-fi or superheroes.

4/7/2013 - 10th play. Friday is a challenging game that is great for a fast gaming fix. My only complaint is the theme which is...unoffensive if uncompelling. It does nothing to suck me in and want to play. Fortunately the gameplay is fun enough to keep me coming back.

Good game, drags too long for a solitaire, I also felt that it was easy, I always get to the fight-the-pirates-stage and it is all down to the final battle. If I could just avoid the tedious built up which is long and monotonous but that would cut out 95% of the game.

Friday is a nice filler solo game. Although I dont really like playing solo this game seems like a perfect fit for a solitaire. Not too much time needed. Just little space on the table and lots of time to optimize your play. You certainly will get better with more plays but the start is very frustarting and hard. But better than winning too easy, huh?

The thorn in every deckbuilding game's side is deck-thinning. For the mechanism to work, there must be appropriate risk and reward to building or thinning your deck. 

Unfortunately, Friday is too easily 'solved' by simply thinning your deck as quickly as possible. There are a few rules of thumb you learn pretty easily and then you simply apply the same way every time. 

If you haven't played a lot of Trading Card Games or Dominion, this might be fun for ten plays, but I felt like I worked this out on the second play.

Simple and pure deck-building game, that is a perfect introduction to the genre. Deckbuilders are often criticized for being multiplayer solitaires, but this makes them good solo games.

Since it's a single-mechanic game in which you use all the cards several times per play (except the pirates cards), it's a great game to explore deeper and deeper.

A small, inexpensive solo game. The idea is that you are Friday, and you are trying to train Robinson Crusoe to get off the island. So you start with a hand of cards that represent Robinson's skills/state of mind. You take two cards off of the encounter deck, and you choose which encounter you want to send Robinson on. Then you flip over the number of cards allowed from that encounter card, and see how Robinson's skill/state of mind value compares to the requirements of the encounter. If you fall short, you can pay a life point to bring out another card and try to succeed, or you can pay the difference in life points, and for each life point you are forced to discard, you can trash a card from your deck. If you pass the encounter, you get to keep the card, which on the lower half is a new Robinson skill/state of mind (representing what he learned from surviving that encounter's adventure). 

There are a lot of factors in play. You need to run through the encounter deck at three different levels. Green (easy), yellow (medium), red (hard). The numeric value required to complete the encounters increases with every increase in difficulty level. So the first time through, you might think it's great to try to fail as many as possible to thin your deck of those bad -1 and 0 value cards, but then you'll have more encounters to face at those increased difficulty levels. Conversely, if you try to win as many encounters in the early round as possible, you may not get to trash as many cards as you like, leaving you with a lot of duds coming out in those harder levels. You also need to consider your life points, as when they run out, you instantly lose the game. So sometimes you fail a lot of encounters and cut cards, then realize you are dangerously low on life. Thankfully, many cards you gain from passing encounters along the way give you special actions, like +1 or +2 life points, +1 or +2 cards, destroy/trash a card, -1 to the encounter's pass level, etc. So those are also a consideration when you decide which encounter to go up against, as you can see at the bottom what skill/state of mind you'll gain from passing. On top of all of this, every time your deck runs out and you need to shuffle your discard pile and cycle through again, you add an aging card, which represents the passage of time on the island and how it wears on Robinson. These are tougher to remove from your deck, as you need to discard two life points to rid of them or use a trashing card. 

If you survive making it through all three difficulty phases of the encounters, you go up against two different pirate ships you must defeat. So essentially, you are not only building a deck to go up against encounters, you are building a deck that will defeat the pirate ships at the end. If you reach the needed level, Robinson makes it off the island. If not, well, he doesn't.

Very well done! Reading the crappy rulebook, I was prepared to hate this game, but I had a lot of fun playing it. Theme is really comical, although pasted-on, and the art could be a lot better (Crusoe's expressions are almost identical from card to card, which is a shame since this kind of assignment is a wonderful opportunity for artists to have fun with faces). Also, I hate the unsleevable card size, but hey, all of this doesn't matter, because this game is a blast.
PS: This was my very fist deckbuilding game, and I have to say I will be very curious to try more.

This is a very fun little solo game. One of the best solo games I have played. You feel the theme when you play, even though it is the mechanics that makes it fun.

The only "problem" I have with it (is the same problem as other games of the same type have) is that after you have beaten the game, it's all about maximizing your score. (My top score is 122 points.) To optimize your game and try to find out the best strategy can be fun, but after a while one gets a little tired of this. 

But that said, this is a game I can highly recommend to people that like to play games solo.

I love this game. An easy-to-play, solitaire-only deck builder and certainly one of those small-box games that punches way above its weight class. Friday is as entertaining as it is brutal, so don't expect a high win ratio while constantly wanting to push yourself to beat the little sucker.

The theme is nicely landscaped and the growth mode of the game through the cards, fully represent.
It's card management game and as soon as possible rid of useless cards that you have in Robinson's deck initially, you will better face the dangers that appears to you.  
Each time you finish the cards of Survival deck, added a card of aging deck on survival deck, and this make  survival deck more difficult.
Finally, having passed through the 3 colored rates, you come face to face with pirates. Giving you the battle and with a little luck you can win.
In conclusion, playing this game, you can say that is pleasant one.

Neat little solo game! Throughout the game, you have to chose which dangers you want to face. It takes a while to find a good balance whether to take on the big challenge or to solve the easy task. The prudent choice switches during the game  depending on which stack of cards has just been reshuffled. I have not won the game yet, but after 6 rounds of play, I came close to the last challenge twice - the pirates.

A deck builder for one? Yes, Friday fills that niche (was there a niche for a solitaire deck builder?) quite well. Fun but challenging. You start so weak you can barely do anything but then you start building yourself up little by little. Nothing is easy however and at no point does this feel like something you can breeze through. Alas as a solitaire game it won't hit the table much but it's a good way to pass 30 + minutes if you're itching for a game and no one to game with.

First solo game I've played.  Hit it 2x in a row to start, lost both times but developed much further in the second game.  Enjoyed, intrigued.  I see Geekbuddies complaining about the rules, but I don't have any questions yet aside from, "are hazards/fighting cards in play at the point of death discarded before scoring?"  Pretty sure this is going to get dozens of plays, which is more than I can say for 95% of the games I own.  Recommend to just about any gamer that will give a solo game a chance.  And I've found it fun to do post-mortems with other players.

I'm really intrigued by this game and would like to try it. Oops, I ordered it!

It took me a few plays to get a strategy figured out, so now I just try to maximize my score. Not bad for solitaire. Plays fast.

Traded for Animal Upon Animal in February 2013.

Traded. It started to feel same-y. Also I'm having less time playing board game solo lately. When I do though, I much prefer short game.

Pretty addicting solo deck builder. Rules are somewhat fiddly, at least more so than I was expecting. This was the main issue for me at first but I then created my own player aid to help kicking off the game quicker each time, and clarifying the vague card effects helped me getting in to the momentum. It plays about 20-30 min and the experience is pretty satisfying. A lot more game-y than Onirim which is a plus.

Love Friedemann Friese titles, and while I've only got a few so far I plan to buy all the ones domestically available in the US. Friday is a sweet solo game where you are basically trying to survive as a Robinson Crusoe until you can be rescued. Works quite well when my little boy is taking a nap.

11/29/14:  The more you play, the better you get.  On the other hand if you stay away for a while, it's noticeable that your play isn't finally tuned. This game is a great value for the money, and I always want, just one more game. 

9/14: up to 90 plays and overall winning 1 game in 5 on level 4.  My September games I've been winning 1 in 4 games.

9/7/14:  Probably took me longer than others to figure out, the game, but I've got over 70 plays in and still enjoying it.  

8/15/14: Sleeved with Swan 57x110 sleeves hand trimmed.

3/22/14: 22 games under my belt, and finally won at level 3.  The game's still enjoyable so upping my rating to a 9.

2/6/14: Nice little deck builder.  The first time through I had no idea what to do, but after the game I had a pretty good idea of what to do.  After losing the first several games, I started winning around game 5 at level 1.  Good gradual learning curve.

RATING: 6.335
This is a fun little deck-building solo game. There are a lot of tough decisions early in the game revolving around when to win fights and when to intentionally lose them. This definitely involves some strategy and tough decisions. This is a pretty fun and portable game to take on trips by myself.

Update: I still enjoy this game a lot, but I have other solo games I play more, so I got rid of it.

Update 2: I kind of regret getting rid of this one. I still have other games I love more, but this was so great to pull out for a quick and challenging solo play.

Solitary games are very scarce, so games like this are always welcomed. plays in 25 mins.
It seems that the only valid strategy you can use is to lose several hazards at the beggining of the game, you don't have much of a choice.
It's a deck building game, where you try to get rid of weak and useless cards.
This a tough game, even on easy it's very dificult to win the game.
The 3 small playing boards aren't really necessary, but are a nice touch and add to the game quality.

The problem with solitaire games is they have to compete with Civ V, and you can't win that battle unless the power goes out.  Friday is a fun game once get your mind wrapped around the basic concept of having to intentionally lose fights in order to thin your deck of bad cards.  The fun is in playing lots of cards and chaining their abilities to win a tough fight, though, so like all deck-builders it is a mixed bag.

RATING: 7
Tök jó játék! Egyszerű szabály, pörgős az egész, egy parti akár pár perc alatt is véget érhet, de max. 15-20 perc, ha már ismeri az ember. Nekem Friese-től a PG után ezt tetszik talán legjobban:) Persze erősen vitatható, hogy ez társasjáték a fix 1 fő miatt. Sokféle taktikai finomság tűnt fel benne már így néhány parti alapján is. Elég nehéznek tűnik, már a legkönnyebb szintbe is beletört a bicskám.

12 parti után úgy érzem, level 3-ig reális esélyem van a nyerésre, de a 4-dik szintet esélytelennek érzem...

Clever little solitaire game. After around half a dozen plays I had an 'aha' moment and proceeded to win 3 of my next 4 games (at Level IV difficulty), losing only to an obscene draw (Cannibals hitting a STOP card as the first draw during the green phase...).

I enjoyed this but after the aha moment and a week of play I'm done.

RATING: 9
Just two starting games.  No chance of winning the game at the moment.  It is good, fun, and challenging.  Components are more than ok, price is good... it looks as a fabulous option for a solitaire game.
UPDATE: After 7 games, 3 victories, still level 1.  Scoring is not as high as others report (max about 80).  Still under investigation, but the game is fantastic...
UPDATE: 10 games.  Still not getting even close to the reported scorings.  I guess it is because I always almost ran out of live tokens.  Probably need to change something in my approach.
UPDATE: On my 11th game I could get more than 100 points.  Clearly, live tokens make the point...
UPDATE: 2013/09/16 First time I play level 4.  Great game!  It makes the game more difficult, for sure, and I was for several battles with 0 life points, but could survive and finally beat both pirates!!!  I could score something about 75, which is quite good for level 4.
UPDATE: 2013/12/03, new record, 84 points in level 4.

Friday is a little clever game I can see myself playing quite a while in the future when I will be in the mood for some solo play!
It's a deck-building game where you start with almost only bad cards in the deck, so the thinning is mandatory. But if you thin too much the aging mechanic will punish you...
The game is very tight, and you can really feel that every choice (and you have many of them, each turn!) is life or death!
Last but not least: somewhat, the theme can be felt while you play (even if the game is an abstract at its chore), and it is not a bad accomplishment for such a little game...

Solid little deckbuilder with a unique theme and play style. I play a ton of games solo, so I wouldn't think that a game made specifically for solo play would have a unique feel for me, but the brilliance of how the theme meets the design in Friday makes for a peaceful, contemplative, deliciously solitaire experience. Great travel game, too. I don't reach for it too often, but I always enjoy it when I do.

I like the idea of solitaire and solo-play games, and I think this has pretty nice theme in it, but I find it feels fairly solvable - which I suppose is an issue with solitaire games.  Admittedly, I have only beaten it once, but I felt content enough to put it back in the box once I did.  I might pull it out again, and I'll have a very relaxing time when I do.  Overall, it's a nice experience.

RATING: 7.5
Fun, light, solo game with interesting strategic choices as you transform your deck via it's deck-building mechanism. It'll probably lack longevity once you get used to the puzzle provided, but that's to be expected for a $12 game. This and Space Hulk: Death Angel are my favorite small-box solo games. The rating is capped at a 6.5 or a 7, due to the longevity concerns, but do not let that deter you. It is well worth the money.

*Edit, June 2017: so it's held up better than I expected. I'll give it a small bump, since it continues to be engaging after 10+ plays.

RATING: N/A
This is hard! I'm not sure yet if the game is always winnable or if certain card configurations are actually impossible to overcome. I hope it is always winnable with correct play, but I expect the reverse is true. I've definitely gotten better at the game with more plays, but it remains to be seen whether I'll keep playing this one.

It is a very quick (sometimes too quick) solo play though, easy way to kill a few minutes between other things, which is probably its biggest appeal.

Deck building game that doesn't cost a fortune.

Why 8.3 ?

- Solo play
- 20 minutes of FUN
- You try to beat your scores
- VERY challenging. I don't believe a bit you can win 50% of your matches in the first 10 trials or you CHEAT.
- Such a game for the price of a cinema ticket deserves being promoted.

After 8 plays I still didn't get to the Pirates in level 1. It was very close though, but the last challenge cards beat me. I still went along pretending I beat that last challenge ... and lost to the first Pirate of the two with 23 vs 30.

Great game. a certain BUY.

Edit : upped it to 8.8 after the launch of the App.

Wow!!!! Solitaire deckbuilding, who would have thought of it? Freese, that's who! I so love this game. I would put Onirim as my number #1 solitaire only game, but this one is close. Culling the bad cards from your deck (by intentionally losing battles) as fast as possible is the winning strategy, but it can be tough, especially on Level 3 (less starting life, extra aging cards in the mix).

Very much a game of balancing winning the fights (and gaining cards in your deck) and running away (and trimming cards from the deck).  I like the mechanic of Robinson aging and becoming weaker as time goes on, keeps pressure on the player to continually trim the deck, and Robinson feels like he stumbles as he gets older but is definitely stronger on the whole.  Nicely done.  Graphics are quite fun, conveys the feeling that poor Friday the native is burdened with this hapless character that washed up on his beach.  

I found that I'd definitely missed a rule or two my first play, and the game is much more challenging once I used all of the rules.   lol.  Raising my score, I really like this one! (raised my score again - such a great solo game!).

This originally didn't resonate with me and I donated it. Trying it again now that I have a lot more board gaming experience. I might like it better with a better understanding of the mechanics.

Raised rating from a 5 to a 6.5. Am liking it a lot better now that I have a better understanding of its mechanics in general. Still not a game I really gravitate toward, but I feel the new rating is more applicable.

Hey, this is fun! I've played twice and lost twice but can't wait to try again. Gameplay is tight, clean and quick and packed with lots of interesting decisions, the worth of which become apparent soon enough in the game to give a real sense of movement in the game. I could see this rating going up and replacing the role played by Space Hulk: Death Angel. It has significantly less theme but less screwage from the dice. It's too quick to have the gravitas of a longer solo game such as Ghost Stories, but, wow, this is a pleasant surprise.

Excellent, intense solitaire deck builder. It's like solitaire Dominion, except you win new cards in ever escalating battles instead of purchasing them, and there is a steady flow of cards with negative value that sneak into your deck. Like Dominion, there aren't a ton of options at every choice point, but the simple choices have high stakes and subtle effects. That makes for a light feeling, but deeply satisfying game.

The theme is fun and it's both terrifying and hilarious to be in a tight spot, fighting cannibals, and you turn over the card you really need and it's... "Moronic", as in you're so nuts from living alone on an island that you've lost your marbles.

Great for playing with kids, if you act as a team.

Addictive!

I love deckbuilding and end up home alone a lot when my wife works the late shift. My only regret is I didn't buy it earlier. It took until play 7 to squeeze out my first win. I hope I haven't 'solved' it. Repeated plays after my win should speak to that.

UPDATE: I definitely felt like I had solved it after I won. The next 3 plays were very unremarkable so I traded it away.

I really want to like this, but the theme just doesn't resonate with me at all. 
I initially had fun with this and even included it on my 10 x 10 Hardcore challenge list. I thought if I forced myself to play it more I would see what many are talking about. Didn't happen.
I like the mechanics for a game every now and then, but I come back to the theme. After I play I always feel like I would have rather spent the time playing something else. 
It is small enough that I will hang on to it and play once a year, but I will never be a diehard that aims for a game of Friday every Friday for a year.

This one is a strange duck, at least for me - a solo game with Euro mechanisms that works!  Likely this is the case because it was designed as a solo game only.  Most Euros with a solo option (like almost all of Rosenberg's offerings) are distinctly uninspiring, in that you are basically puzzling your way to a high score.  With Friday, you are trying to kill pirates, not score better than last time, so the theme is there, and happily the game is decently tough, even in "normal" mode.  Is this the only FF I have left in my collection?  How did that happen?  (Don't answer that).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very challenging game with some really clever, thematic mechanics. It's a brilliant touch to have the aging cards get introduced to your deck every time you deplete it, keeping you from culling too many of your weaker cards. On the other hand, you absolutely need to get rid of some cards to make your deck more efficient. Finding the right balance between them is key.

Unfortunately I have not yet been able to find that balance. I frankly don't believe people who say they won their first game (or who win most of the games they play), but I'm also notoriously bad at deck builders, so what do I know? I've played 6 times now and still haven't won. The good thing is that this means I have lots of challenging playtime ahead of me.

RATING: 8
Played a couple times (both losses), and it's pretty clever and fun. And not easy - food is very tight. You can't be cavalier about spending food to win challenges. It seems to be all about identifying cards you need to add to your deck, knowing when to take risks to try to get the really good cards, and what to do when you have a lost challenge but not enough good cards to destroy. As long as you have 0s and -1s to burn on a lost challenge, it seems futile to spend resources to try to win. You'll probably need to learn to do a bit of card counting.

For the love of God, get a rules editor. It could be the original writing, it could be the translator, but this is another Friedemann game that is fundamentally simple, yet with in infuriatingly confusing and imprecise rules set.

While I probably won't be sitting down for many solitaire games, this game is quite addicting and challenging!  Pretty tough to beat, especially as you feel your way through your first couple games.

Most deck-building games seem to be largely solitaire exercises anyways, so it makes a lot of sense that a purely solitaire game would be designed with the mechanic!

I can totally see playing this more if it were an app I could play on an airplane or to kill some time at a restaurant or something.  As a physical game, however, I doubt I'll end up playing it all that often, despite how good it is.

I did a lot of research on this game prior to purchasing, and yet, it still felt foreign when I started playing. Although I started to pick it up quickly, some of the rules just didn't make sense. Thankfully others had some of the same questions and I was able to continue. When I finally felt comfortable with the rules, I found the game to be very entertaining. I played several games over two days, and again after a week. I didn't feel as if I got the same results, but I did notice that there was a certain way to play which would eliminate the bad cards, therefore aiding in the winning of all future cards. It may not help win the final battle, but it can lead to stagnation during main game play, imo. But, I do really enjoy this game, and it is one of my favorite solo play games!

RATING: 5.5
Solo game where the good luck I had in the draw for my first two plays leading to what I have to come find out are rare wins kind of turned me off.

If these mechanics were on a multi-player game, I would probably end up rating this much higher simply because I love the whole thinning and increasing as a result of success and failure. 

If this game were implemented as an Android game, I would definitely rate it higher because then the game would lose all the tedium of shuffling, flipping cards, moving tokens, setting up the game, activities I don't mind in a multi-player game because it's a social activity, but in a solo game it feels like busy work, and spending over half the game doing busywork all alone is really boring.

It is kind of fun to make an occasional impulse buy at my local game shop. It's fun to roll the dice on the chance that I might find something really good, and I like supporting local retailers. 

The problem is that so many of my impulse buys turn out ot be utter shit. Friday, a sort of clever solo game, while it isn't quite shit, is really not my type of thing, and had I not been getting all spontaneous I probably wouldn't have bought it. Lesson learned.

While it wouldn't make me like the game any better, the rulebook really could be clearer. There is no reason for a simple eurogame to have so many ambiguities.

Deckbuilding fans: you owe it to yourselves to check out Friday, whether solo gaming is usually your thing or not. I'm not generally a solo gamer, but Friday caught my eye awhile back and I'm very glad I tried it! 

There's a lot to like about what Friday brings to the deckbuilding formula. The main source of tension is in the hazard cards - every turn you must encounter one and fight against it. Here's the catch, though: winning AND losing fights are equally important. You have to decide which fights to win and which you're better off losing - and you can lose a fair amount of health doing either. Wins net you new, more powerful cards for your deck while losses allow you to trash unwanted cards from your deck.

It gives the game a nice choice point during turns (something not all deckbuilders have) and trying to win a fight often involves a small press-your-luck element as you pay life to draw new cards and rely on your knowledge of what's left in the deck and lady luck to bring you a win.

Another welcome little wrinkle in the design comes from the aging cards - essentially, every time you cycle your deck you must add in a penalty card. It's a really clever way to discourage pruning your deck too much and adds just that extra little bit of friction to make things interesting.

Mechanically this game is probably more like an 8, but I personally don't find upping difficulty levels in these sorts of games to be all that thrilling so now that I've conquered it on one difficulty level I can't see it getting super frequent play.

High Score: Level 1 - 68

This is a frustratingly brutal one player game. It's easy to learn, quick to play, and very difficult to win. I like that it is very quick to setup and play especially if you play multiple games in a row. The length is very good for a solo game. Now, if I could only beat the "easy" level...

Update: Now that I've beaten the "easy" level...this game is more of a puzzle than a game.  Once you figure out how to beat it, you've essentially "solved" it. There is little chance of losing after that. However, still a great game that I like to pick up and play once in a while

Played twice and just not feeling it. Maybe it's because I am finding it very difficult, but I'm not even getting close to facing the pirates. A few plays and I've barely sniffed the red round of cards. The way the fight cards work is neat since once defeated they get added to your attack deck, but the victories to gain those cards just felt so few and far between to really be of any benefit in later rounds. I think for me the two main downsides are that three times through the fight deck feels like one too many times and the fact that managing the different decks throughout the game felt tedious. I had different piles spread out on my table and at times had trouble keeping it all straight. If this was an app I'd probably have a lot of fun with it, but at this point I'd rather get out the Star Realms app or something from the Oniverse and play through that.

Elegant, thematic, hard to beat, interesting and utterly engaging. One of the top solitaire games around and arguably the best game of Friese.

+ clockwork mechanisms that work great together
+ interesting and tough decisions all the way
+ deck recycling timing decision is paramount
+ enough goal variety to keep replayability high
+ highly vocative theme
+ nice art and sturdy components
+ small box and play footprint

= some card counting memory needed to play very well

Fun little solo game.  Didn't get it at first but after a youtube video watching the play-through, it was easy enough.  After about 10 losses, I finally won after drawing some easy (16pts, 20pts) pirates.  Good game for solo, and can finish in about 20 minutes or so.  Update...Friday is an asshole.

Nice solo deck building card game that once you learn the rules is good fun.  I'm just learning and have yet to even get to the pirates yet. It will feel like an acomplishment once I defeat the scallywags.  Looks to have very good replayability so I can see this one staying in my library forever.

I found this rule set can be a little difficult to grasp and in the end I needed to find a game play video. This is a stripped down deck building game and the rules are simple, if not easy to read.

To play this game well you have need to explode out of the traps like a race horse.  Too little or too much aggression and you will lose.  This does remind me of  mage knight where you can triple your first score by game three. In both games I reached a plateau by game three and progress is now much less trivial.

Wanting to play this more, but has been enjoyable so far.  Out of 12 games played (as I write this comment), only one "win" by defeating both pirates.  But I view this as a good thing.  If the game was too easy, then I'd grow bored of it quickly.  

Nicely constructed "deck management" game.

I don't normally like playing games solitaire, but this is a fun little game.  I am sad I took almost a year to sit down with the rules to play it.

For what it is, it is a lot of fun.  At some point, it may become no longer challenging, but I am far from that point.  At 8 plays, I finally got a single win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great little solitaire game with the neat conceit that obstacles beaten with your deck turn into new cards, while older and worse cards can be removed by losing to those same obstacles.  Unless your deck is well-tuned, you will progressively lose life points with either option, so the game becomes an interesting mix of balancing adding new cards, destroying old ones, and managing your supply of life points such that you are making progress while still being insulated from disaster.  Add 'aging' into this, which serves as a timer by adding a bad card every time you cycle through your deck, and there's a nice range of decisions to make in every game.  Randomization keeps it spiced up, as is usually the case in solitaires; you know the initial configuration of your deck, but the hazards/opportunities, aging cards, and the pirates you fight at the end change every game. I can see somewhere around 50-100 plays coming out of this before it gets old.

Production values are good, with humorous art, nice life tokens repurposed from Furstenfeld, and some probably extraneous play mats in a little square box.  Setup takes a little while, maybe five minutes out of the box, but resets of the game once you lose (or win maybe) are a little shorter.  It takes up a bit of space on the table, so probably not an airplane game, though the ingenious traveler could probably manage by ditching the mats and using a different system to track life points.

There's something inherently sad about playing a board game by yourself, so purchasing a game that can ONLY be played solo makes for a rather depressing transaction.  But undeniably, this is a niche that needed filling for me and many others, and Friday fills it with aplomb.  

The way the game progresses and forms a sort of narrative arc is really clever; you always feel completely unprepared and under-powered, and most of your victories feel like they're by the skin of your teeth.  Yet somehow, by the time you reach the seemingly impossible pirates, you have quite a lot of tactical options, and can sometimes just steamroll right over them.

Negatives are that it can become a bit difficult to keep track of what abilities you have and haven't used in some of the bigger fights.  

Also, I could be wrong,  but with the way the aging deck is implemented, it seems unwise to ever go after the harder hazards if you can avoid them; the big rewards aren't better enough than the small ones to justify going through your Robinson Deck so much faster.  So the game might suffer from lack of strategic variety, or perhaps I'm the one lacking the imagination to see other viable paths to victory.

RATING: 6
This is an extremely fun solo game, and there is a lot of game in this small little box. You are trying to get off a deserted island (Robinson Crusoe theme) but your starting deck is filled with terrible cards. As you defeat hazard cards they become better cards for your deck and you can also rid your deck of the bad cards in some cases. In the end you have to face some pirates as well. Lots of strategy to this one.

This is a tough game.  I've yet to win, and barely once made it to the ship card.  My rating might change once I "get" this game and am able to beat it.  But right now it's beating me.

Picked it up again after a bit of a hiatus, and beat it two times in a row...I think I may have had played the rules wrong the first couple times.  Because this time around was quite a bit easier.  I actually want to play it now on a harder setting.  I do want to double check that I am playing the rules correctly.

Nope! Played the rules wrong, once again.  Just can't seem to get it to work for me.  Might not last too much longer in my collection. :(

RATING: 7
Obsessive little game. My first deck building game. At first, I couldn't figure out how to beat it! I've won at all levels and now play only at level 4, but I've beaten it once at level 4..

I actually learned a lot watching my 10 year son play it. He often refuses to accept defeat against a hazard and thus build a strong deck. But he winds up with too many aging and 0 … cards which comes back to bit him later in the game. But it was his risk taking that provided to me the initial keys to figuring out how to win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In this solo adventure, you're doing a little deck-building, continually trying to burn bad cards while overcoming hazards to add in some good cards.  If you haven't drawn enough good cards to defeat a hazard, you can give up precious life points to draw more.

Most cards have a special ability which is where the real meat of the game takes place.  All the while you're balancing two decks which accelerate the game each time you shuffle, leading you towards a very tough confrontation with some pirates.

I want to love this, but so far I just like it.  I can see playing this regularly until securing a win - but will the increased difficulty levels be enough to sustain interest in the long-term?  I'm not sure.

RATING: 9
Very fun and interesting little deck building game. Much more deeper than seems at first. Although the game variance seems not to be very strong (the winning strategy is quite similar in each game), the tactic decisions are interesting each game.
So far one of the best options for me when I want to play some quick solo game. Also this is my choice when I plan to play outside my house - it is very portable and the game itself is very relaxing and easygoing.

What I like:
- I like the deckbuilding part of the game, for the mostly trash like deck you built a powerful one. And every mistake you did during the process will come back for you.
- The game is very portable, just a pack of cards and some tokens. You even don't need the little boards to play it.
- Game time is perfect for me. Although It is not short as for example in The Lost Expedition or Mint Works, the average time is cca 20-25 minutes for me and I always want to play one more game.
- After 100 games I am still not tired of it at all. Contrary, as I know the game more, I believe I enjoy it even more.

What I dislike:
- final fights could be tougher, you should win almost everytime when you get there.
- the art is somewhat cartoonish and not very well put (compare with once mentioned The Lost Legion). The card images are samey with just some different detail. But I must say that I don't look at card images during play in general so this is only a minor issue.
- Sleeves. There is no good sleeves available for this game. And You will need them - there is a lot of shuffling. I have sleeved it, but the sleeves are a bit bigger and very soft. I can imagine how it should be played with proper premium sleeves

What an interesting game. This is my first true solo game.  I picked it up because it was the highest rated solo I could find.  Solo isn't my genre, but I thought I'd try it out. It's a little weird for me--not this specific game, just solo in general.

As far as the game is concerned, it's an interesting puzzle. It can teach the same skill required in most deck building/limited resource games. It requires multiple plays to get the balance, while at the same time there are nice randomizers that will make it different every time. 

Not sure I'll go hog wild because of the solo focus, but for its genre, I have nothing but good things to say.

Avec ce jeu en solitaire, le joueur aura à coeur de mener Robinson à quitter l'île où Vendredi coulait des jours heureux. Et il aura fort à faire pour que ce civilisé survive aux dures conditions de la vie en milieu sauvage : explorations dangereuses, recherches de matériel sauvé du naufrage, rencontres avec de féroces animaux et de non moins féroces cannibales.
Si le matériel reste en-deça des standards actuels, il n'empêche que Vendredi est un jeu réussi. Remporter (enfin !) la victoire apporte au joueur seul face aux cartes une immense satisfaction. Un système de niveau durcit les conditions de victoire pour les plus courageux.
Une petite boite au potentiel ludique énorme.

A great solo card game when you have to wait around, don't feel like reading a book and don't want to drain your phone's battery.  I think of it as robinson crusoe light.

Fairly difficult solitaire game that can be fun in the right occasion but feels like it lasts one round too many. To date, I've never made it to the pirates but have come close a number of times. Does take longer than I would like to setup due to the number of decks that need to be separated.

[16 May 2017] - 6.75 (28 plays)
This game is a neat little push your luck solitaire game that has some tokens to fiddle with, cards, decisions to make and gets progressively harder. It's probably one of the best games that I've played solo and it fairly compact. With 28 plays, I can say that I'd rather be playing a game with another person. This will work in a pinch or when I need a break from a screen (I do write software for a living), but social interaction is one of the reasons I started playing games. 

[16 May 2017] - 6 (28 plays)

I've left a little bit of a margin in my rating to allow for a "deluxe" version that ups the quality a bit more.

Very clever deck management game. The balance and decisions between adding more cards to the fighting deck vs thinning out the cruddy cards (at the cost of life points) is very subtle and entertaining. And that's when you've already got past the basic decisions of going for easy or hard hazards. And the fact this also feeds into how fast you churn the fighting deck (and hence age Robinson) makes for some tricky choices.
Plays very well and fast. Definitely one of the better 1 player games out there. An absolute bargain at the asking price.

(Hard to rate it an 8, since who would "I suggest it" to given its a solo game? But its an 8 anyway.)

Not a bad little solitaire.

Has plenty of decisions that one encounters through out the game, but not as many as I initially thought.  

Has replayability as a time killer.  Takes little time to set up, and clean up.  Win or lose the time spent playing is time spent that I enjoy spending.  Winning still feels like an accomplishment, and winning streaks become the standard of measurement.

My only beef with the game is short sided creativity.  There are only 5 types of hazards...which means I do the same thematic activity OVER AND OVER again...boring in a thematic sense...A little more creativity could have gone a long way in this game.

Friday is a nice solo deck builder. I like it's puzzle aspect, I enjoyed all my plays of it and it surely has some replayability. So why no higher rating? In the end, I wish this would be an electronic game. For a solo game, it surely needs a lot of table space and forces you to do a lot of (simple) math in your head, especially in the last few rounds. Maybe, this could have been a little more streamlined.

Also, I wish they had used square cards instead of the rectangle ones that are included in the box. Since you have to rotate them after they have been used, you mess with your layout all the time.

All in all, I would recommend Friday to gamers who like solo games. For the prize it is sold, you can't do anything wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After my first couple of plays I probably would have rated this an eight or a nine but it quickly lost its luster.  I wouldn't say that the game is solvable but an optimum strategy is available.  The game still holds up because there are interesting tactical decisions during play but winning or losing hinges on a few key decisions and the luck of the draw.  Play count indicates sessions not individual attempts.  I will keep it because nothing else in my collection really fits the slot of short solo Euro.

RATING: 4
This game is just so-so. I knew going into it that the theme wouldn't (and still doesn't) appeal to me. I typically like solo card games, but this one just missed for me. I can't quite put my finger on why, but every single turn just felt dry and uninteresting. Perhaps it had to do with the way you defeat a challenge: drawing X cards and checking if you number is bigger than the challenge's. The special abilities of the cards added some mild variety to the turn, but none of the cards combined in truly interesting ways and the whole deck-building aspect felt lackluster. The aging cards also felt a bit weird to me, as thinning your deck is supposed to be a core tenant of deck-builders. However, Friday punishes you every time you cycle through your deck, making deck thinning an much less attractive (and viable) tactic.

Maybe I'll come back to this one later and it will surprise me, but quite frankly I'd rather spend my time playing any one of the Oniverse games instead.

Very clever mechanism for a deckbuilder: inefficiency causes you to gain detrimental cards, which then must be removed or played around. I think I've only seen this in Friday and Mage Knight. I wish there were penalty cards for Arctic Scavengers solo setup...

It's a good enough game. It opens you to the idea that playing solo is fun or at the very least, (for others) viable. I eventually sold mine because I had better solo games/ deck builders. I later found out why I sold my copy; the game practically plays itself. The decision aspect is in choosing what challenges you want to fight/ put in your deck. If there were more choices other than what cards I'd fight and put into my deck, I guess I would have kept it. I just felt like I couldn't affect how I would win in the game. (If say, you had cards in hand which you could choose to play rather than blindly drawing, it'd be somewhat better. Granted, it wouldn't be the same game) For what it is, its okay and still playable.

A solitaire game where the player is Man Friday, training Robinson Crusoe for his battle against the pirates.  A nice little deck churning card game.  The player flips up two "encounter" cards and chooses one to tackle.  Cards are then flipped from the "Crusoe" deck to either defeat the encounter, or be defeated.  If the encounter is defeated, you get the card to add to your deck - typically a good thing.  If you are defeated, it drains your life, but you get to trim your deck and get rid of weaker cards - making you stronger (deck) and weaker (life) at the same time.  After three runs through the "encounter" deck, hopefully your Crusoe deck and life is solid enough to defeat the pirates.  Fantastic solitaire game - mechanically simple, but serves up some tough choices for the player.  A gem.

Tough solitaire game with simple rules (still managed to screw them up, drawing from the aging deck instead of the action deck...) which plays fast.

This is a clever game in a nice package that feels like a deck-building trainer.  I don't feel like it has much replay value for me.  I beat it on hard after 3 games and feel kinda done.  Going for higher scores doesn't appeal to me much - I'd probably rather go back to solo Thunderstone!

Friday and me have a weird history. I bought it back in my hayday of game purchasing, when my collection amplified tenfold. Back then, with near daily game days with the housemates, I pulled out Friday once when I bought it, struggled through the rule-book, played it once, and it then spent years in the drawer of my shelf.

In the past week, years since the madness of numerous game days and now with game days coming only once a month (if that,) I rediscovered it in my draw and gave it another try. I've since played ten rounds and have yet to beat the easiest difficulty. I am determined to win, and having a blast.

RATING: 7
Friday is a fun "solo adventure" that uses deck-building as it's central mechanism. The game has a nice arc to it, as you help Robinson navigate the green, yellow, and red phases, and then the final showdown with two pirates. 

During each phase, there are winning strategies to develop your fight deck engine. The final showdown is fun, because many fight cards will be drawn as you use the cards special abilities (+1/2 cards, exchange, copy).

Friday does play similarly each time. Once you understand the winning strategy, you just need to execute it. The final showdown pirates do not offer much variability: the strategy against them all is to build that fight deck engine and then let it run. I wish that the different pirates would force the player to tune the fight deck a certain way (but they don't).

I think it curious that many commenters consider this game to be "hard". After several learning plays, I now rarely lose (on Level 4). Perhaps because I have played all the Oniverse games, I have sufficient experience with randomness mitigation strategies that are common to solitaire games. I do consider all of the Oniverse games to be deeper experiences with juicier decisions.

I'm happy I bought, learned, and now own and play Friday. It's a small game and rather inexpensive, and I've definitely got my money's worth.

Picked up a copy at my local game shop the other day. I have wanted this game for some time now and was not disappointed. The game is a wonderful randomized puzzle where sometimes you have to work through the fact that you cannot control everything but can do your best to level the odds to be a near even chance of winning based on your choices. Great little solo game that I will keep in my collection.

RATING: 10
The beginning of the Great Solo Initiative of 2017. For years I had a strong affinity for cooperative games because my wife liked them so much.  I got a LOT of coops so my wife would play with me.... In the fall of 2016 (six weeks after my stroke) my wife left me. By early 2017 it was clear she had no intention of coming back any time soon. Now coops leave me feeling a little empty. So begins my quest for solo games. The first one I bought in this flurry was Friday .... and boy does Friday set the bar high!

At its heart it's a mini deck builder. You'really helping "Robinson" (the rules make it clear that the character is "based on" Robinson Crusoe) prepare to battle pirates at the end of the game. You do this by facing wild animals (which apparently include chickens, based on artwork on the cards) cannibals, and exploring the island. These events give Robinson weapons and experience, but through the whole game Robinson also ages, slowing him down and limiting his fighting abilities. 

This game is smart and tight. But most of all it is fun. It's a 45 minute game that I play back-to-back-to-back. This will be the solo standard for years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best solo games I've played as you choose which cards to deal with as they come out.  The mechanics are easy as you draw and either defeat the obstacle or spend life points to draw more cards/get rid of cards.  It gets more and more difficult as you go on and that is definitely a good thing as you will be wracking your brain to do certain moves while avoiding aging cards that hinder your progress.

RATING: 6
(Revised from 9)
Am I playing this wrong? As the losses have stacked up, my interest in this game has cooled off considerably. I've tried multiple strategies, and read all the forums, and I still suck at this game. I want to have fun, not get kicked in the face over and over and over...

(Old review) 

So basically, I should never end up on a deserted island, because I'd be dead in like 5 minutes, if Friday is anything to go by. 

The learning curve, thus far, is fairly steep on this game. Perhaps it is akin to climbing a mountain, in that you must take it one battle at a time. The battles that I have fought hard, and won, using special skills, and pushing my luck, have been quite satisfying. When death comes, and the game ends, I feel resigned, and thoughtful. "What would I do different next time?" "What worked well?" "What definitely didn't work, at all?"

Decent card stock, clever design/mechanics; an elegant, fun little game, with some big moments.

Great little deck builder. A good bit of luck is to be expected with a shuffled deck, but you do get to make some important, informed decisions along the way. My biggest negative is how messy and cluttered the table is during the final stages of the game.

Friday is actually a nice little solo game that is very light but difficult to master. The setup is quick and easy but beating the game is actually extremely tough.....on the easiest setting. I have played about 7 games and have one once on the easiest setting. My lowest score is -65 which is basically the game kicking dirt on you while youre already down. Guarantee new players will not even come close to winning much less even finishing the game for the first couple rounds. Tense, many decisions to make, and if you flip the table there isn't much to clean up.

Do you pay life to draw extra cards and beat the encounter?  Or do you pay life to escape instead so you can cull the crap out of your deck.  Make your deck too small and you'll age too quickly.  Do you risk going after the big encounters while they're still relatively weak, or pick the easy encounters and conserve cards?

Best thing about it -- no having to beg somebody else to play a game with you!

A challenging solitaire deck-building puzzle with a fun theme. I especially enjoy having to take risks to draft the cards I want, love how natural the increasing difficulty feels, and appreciate the overall progression of the game. The pirate battle creates a really cool "end game" moment for each potential victory.

This is definitely one that I'll play when the mood strikes. I love that it's a solo adventure because it means I can play when I want, which is wonderful. I also dislike that it's completely solo because it means I can't play it with others when I want. Overall it's a smart little game and one I had fun playing and plan to enjoy in the future.

RATING: 8.5
A deck-building game, which is normally not my cup of tea.  I tend to be more visually oriented and prefer a game with some kind of a map...  However, the game is quick and a scratches a different kind of itch.  After 4 plays I know that I like it but I sure as hell haven't worked out a winning strategy.  But it's one of those games where losing just makes you want to try one more time.  And I love the small box; storage is at a premium in our apartment!  Note: increased score by 0.5 once I FINALLY won a game!

Wow.  What an amazing solitaire game!  So much fun to play.  It's very challenging, and you have to use your cards just right to have good chance at winning.

Once the player reaches the pirates, the game game goes from very good to "epic".  Don't be surprised if you need to cycle through your Robinson deck a few times... drawing card after card... reshuffling and drawing card after card again (and spending LIFE to do so).  It's at these moments that yield "nail-biting" suspense and you need to carefully contemplate ALL strategic options for one false move and you will lose!  It's a great game to have in your collection, and I don't see myself tiring of it anytime soon.  Grade: B+/A-

This game is so close to being perfect.  My biggest gripe (and the thing that prevents it from being a great game) is that the rules are almost impenetrable because of just some poor German-to-English translation.

More compelling than it ought to be, probably due to the core mechanisms whereby 1) you know what each task is going to give you and, when you succeed, that card is rotated and out into your personal deck, and 2) you can choose to fail a task to purge a card. It's just a slick little package.
Update: I eventually sold this to make room for other games, and because I don't tend to play solo games. But I almost regret it. Something about this game has stuck with me. It's a fun little puzzle, and the art and even the little chits get it just right. Just super-charming.

[b]THE GOOD:[/b] My initial enthusiasm for the game was good. Colorful graphics, fun theme, easily engaged mechanics, neat development of difficult, small tablespace, quick playtime.

[b]THE BAD:[/b] Despite all this, after four plays, it's already feeling quite samey to me - a problem for me since variability of play is my number one priority.

[b]THE VERDICT[/B]: A light, but challenging solo deckbuilder with fairly simple mechanics, but an interesting 3-levels-and-a-boss play arc. Not a lot of variation between plays. [b]No need to own; happy to borrow.[/b]

3rd play. Level 1, 33 VPs. (46f-10a) + 15p + 0LP - 18h = 33VP.

The best pure solo/solitaire board game you can get right now. The game offers varying amount of difficulty and is quite challenging. You make your deck stronger by removing weak cards and gaining stronger ones that make defeating encounters easier. You will have a harder time acquiring cards as you will have many cards that do not add anything to your attack value or worse has a minus value. After going through the final hazard level you will have to defeat the 2 pirates that you draw from the start of the game. The game is very easy to learn and understand and the most challenging thing to understand about the game is the interaction of the card text effects and how they work. The instruction book makes it very clear how it can be used and there is good video on youtube that explains all the game effects very well. Very small game size which makes it another great stocking stuffer and portable game. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a great solo game!

I could be missing something in the strategy, but it seems like each game follows the same pattern. Thin deck of negative and 0 value cards and get cards to trash bad ones in the first round, always go for the highest numbered ones in the last two rounds. It's still a good solo game but not as varied as I'd like.

Purchased as handy solo game.  Do remember that you start off with 5 plus points over 4 cards and 5 minus points over 5 cards in the deck, as well as the 9 zeros, so if you choose a hazard card with a 4 or 5 before you have won any additional fighting cards you are going to lose against it and have to pay heavily - only worthwhile to get rid of minus cards if you have a run.  Having not picked it off the shelf for a year or two it took me a game to get back into, but really the rules are fairly straightforward once your brain is in gear.  Choose your hazard card.  Fight it with your free card draw allowance.  If you haven't beaten or equalled the hazard value, which enables you to add the hazard to your fighting card deck,  choose to pay a life per card to continue fighting it with additional cards, or pay the hazard value in played cards plus lives for the card to go away till the next round, discarding as many of your undesirable fighting cards as possible up to the number of lives you have paid to get rid of it.  Special abilities enable you to add or lose lives, draw or destroy cards for free, reduce the hazard value, copy abilities of already played cards etc.  If you survive three rounds of hazards then you can try to beat two pirate cards which have high values and often special conditions.  Plenty of replay value for occasional players, but not enough strategy for me to be interested in regular play. Might feel differently if I were on a desert island.......

Interesting solitaire game. Difficult but doable. I lost my first game, won the second barely.

Rating of 7 after 1 Play - resounding loss (didn't make it out of hazard level yellow). Definitely worth a few more plays before I settle on a long term rating. It is the best solitaire game I have played. First play requires the rule book in hand. The rules of set-up and play are there - but require careful attention. Much easier to learn from another player than from the rules. I did appreciate the page in the rules that gives 3 different courses of action to take given the same situation. That gave some strategy pointers straight away - needed for a solitaire game.

This is quite a bit of fun! Very frustrating, but engaging decision making.  I really enjoy the game up to the pirate fights. The pirates are not difficult to beat, per se, but they take a lot of points to kill, and keeping track of the fighting value total and unused and used special powers can get be a bit of a mess. Might have to use tokens and a calculator to keep track as I throw down against these pirate-shouldered patch-eyes!  Otherwise, a neat solo game that deserves repeated plays.

Friday is a lot more punishing than I expected it to be, but that makes it even more satisfying. The components are nice & the footprint is small. The gameplay is very simple but the strategy builds up as you collect new abilities on cards. I like having to build your deck through combat rather than just using resource cards to get new cards every turn. I like the scoring because I can track my progress and even if I lose, if I scored better than last time I feel like I accomplished something. All in all this is a really fun solo game with a lot of replayability.

What a weird and wonderful little game.  You actually feel like you're training and getting stronger as the game progresses.

Second play: Wow.  Even more clever than I originally thought.  There are a lot more meaningful decisions to be made than I first thought.  Minor quibble: there are a lot of opportunities to miss small rules or miscount.  My second play was a lot smoother than the first though and I found myself referring to the rulebook only a few times.

Broke this out on a whim...so interesting.  Is there an optimal strategy?  Obviously, trashing bad cards is very important, but having to choose between the two hazards that come up each turn takes some thinking.  Do I go for the higher point value knowing that if I fail, I can trash cards?  Do I pick the easier one to save life points, knowing it may hurt me in the long run?  Do I pick the card purely for the special ability?  0-3 so far.  I need to play this several times in a row tonight.

Sweet mother of god, my first victory with 26 points.  Not a great score, but I'm just happy I finally won.  

Argh - instead of thinning the deck, I thought I'd see what would happen if I tried conquering as many hazards as possible and just use the Destroy special ability cards to drop the weak initial cards.  I couldn't defeat the second pirate card (40 HP).

After 8 plays, as a solitaire game, this one is pretty hard to beat.  It plays in under 20 minutes, and set-up is fast.  I'm starting to have concerns about it getting played out eventually, but since I'm still playing at the introductory difficulty level, I can't be sure yet.  

Moved on to Level 4.  Lost my first game before even meeting the pirates.  

Yet to win on Level 4.  It's a tough one, and just getting to the red stage is a feat in itself.

Level 1 record: 3-5  
Level 1 high score: 97 points

Level 4 record: 0-12

It's hard to make good solitaire games. This one tasks you with teaching Robinson Crusoe to escape your island. It's a great variant on deckbuilding, where you have to fight cards to subsequently add them to your deck, representing the experience gained from the encounter. Lost encounters allow you to discard weak cards instead. When you shuffle the deck you add an ageing card. discouraging too much tuning. Very good.

RATING: 9
It has a very, very clever deck management mechanics with multi-functional cards which somehow manages to integrate a deep sense of progression and well paced increase in difficulty and challenges during the game. All this without dragging on and a perfect climax to the game (final stage boss if you like) that isn't impossible but manages to feel epic (in a mini way) the game only takes about 15-25minutes to play. Its a game that needs surprising amount of skill and strategy for a solo card game. Highly recommended.

I am giving it a 9, not because its huge or compares directly with my other 9 of 10 games, but for what it was design as:  A short solo adventure, its just about perfect.  The best I've every played.

(not a 10 out of 10 because after 9 games I manage to beat the Lvl 4 difficulty (toughest in the game) with 119 points! (suffice it to say that's a pretty high score), so I guess they could've made it harder, the beauty is I still don't mind going back and replaying in despite.

Fascinating little solo deckbuilder.  Gotta play at level 4 for the full hurt.  Although you may find yourself always tending to the same play, some of the pirate ships encourage trying some new tactics.  There are good decisions on how fast to trim your deck.  Too fast, and you will age too quickly and run out of food trying to get rid of the worse cards.  Too slow, and your deck will be too clogged to defeat worthwhile hazards in the red era.  After many plays, it is too samey to play more than 2 or 3 quick games a week, but still, that's a LOT of play from this little gem.

But way too hard. This kind of game is so unenjoyable for me, playing over and over to try to get an edge, eek out a win.

RATING: 7
The theme works brilliantly for what's really happening! I love the incorporation of a simple and effective aging mechanic. I see how it's like Dominion/Thunderstone but more personalized. I sometimes get that Onirim 'already screwed' feeling but I feel as if my choices are much more important here. It's deeper than Death Angel, but not quite as a bigger solo game like Defenders of the Realm/Ghost Stories.
High regards for the portability and speed of the game though. Recommended even if my score isn't all that high. (C'mon, it was $12!)

The only straight solo game I own (so far) but it's a great one.  Whenever I play, I play a dozen games in a row.  It's challenging but tremendously fun and once you master the easy level, there are built in more challenging levels.
There's obviously a bit of luck to every game in the card draw, but a skilled player will be able to minimize the luck factor (though you can never relieve it altogether)

Most of my gaming is two-player with the wife but she gets tired of games far faster than I do. She will go weeks at a time without wanting to play board games. So, I have, by necessity, gotten into solo games (I also really like Friese's work). This is a fun but very challenging solitaire experience. I have only beaten it once. Traded away.

A fun game to play individually, although it doesn't give you an option not to. I've played this game a few times now but haven't made it all the way through the game yet up to level 4. So far it has been a fun experience. I can definitely see myself learning the strategy a little more each time I play. Since i haven't officially beaten the whole game yet i'm not sure how the replayable this game will be afterwards. I'll come back and update my comments and rating if i find that it isn't much fun to replay the game after beating it.

Friday is a pleasant and satisfying solo experience for me. In comparison to other solo games I've played (which is not that many), it's low-stress and plays relatively fast, perfect when I want to engage my brain for a little while. It's a lot of fun to start the final battles with the pirates thinking that Robinson can't beat them, and then figure out a way for him to win.

Friday is a well-crafted solitaire game with some subtlety. The game works so well because it presents you with multiple goals that are often incompatible.

Your deck starts off being absolutely terrible. Most of the cards have zero or negative values. In order to get rid of those cards, you actually need to lose fights. Losing fights drains your life points and brings you closer to death, but it also allows you to learn from the experience and trash one or more of the cards you played that turn. But in order to get better cards into your deck, you need to win fights. Just knowing whether you're trying to win or lose a fight is not always easy.

Another tension involves the deck cycling. On one hand, you want to cycle your deck quickly because you are constantly improving it. On the other hand, you must add an "aging" card to your deck every time it runs out - and these are terrible, nasty cards.

Mentally keeping track of what's left in your deck is very important. Be smart about which challenges to face early. You'll want to cycle your deck quickly so that you have as much power as possible by the time you reach the yellow challenges. This means tackling many of the harder challenges right from the very start, just to cycle your deck and pay to dispose of most of your bad cards.

Friday does an outstanding job of conveying its plot and setting, which is especially impressive for a small, mechanically-slick card game like this. At the start of the game, our "hero" Robinson Crusoe is a bumbling fool who doesn't have the skills and knowledge to survive in the wild. As he decides what risks he is willing to take, you can guide him in learning new skills and eliminating the worst of his mistakes. By the end of the game, he is haggard and worn, but also cunning and deadly. Where the balance lies will determine whether you survive the expedition.

Journal of Friday's Expeditions:

Level 1: dead, 115

Level 2: 54, 159

Level 3: (skipped)

Level 4: dead, 63, 82, 113, dead, dead, 78
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really good solo game that employs an interesting drifting mechanic (discarding bad cards is as important as getting the good ones). In essence, this is a deck-builder. The art could be clearly improved, but the theme is strong and well-linked to the drafting mechanic. Robinson's abilities improve over time and in order to have any chances to win it's crucial to use them wisely.

Great game! Use your encounters with various hazards to cull the bad cards from your deck and add better cards to it. The game plays quickly and has a unique theme that fits perfectly with the gameplay (effects of aging, increased danger, and a climactic ending when you're least ready for it). It's a light game that's not simplistic and is compelling enough to merit repeat plays.

Intriguing. I tend to be a very good "sight-reader" of games (i.e., I'm a decent player from my very first playing and know what I want to achieve right away). Not so with Friday. Realizing that you *want* to lose fights is non-intuitive and recognizing when to lose and when to (try to) win is not so easy. Being solitaire, this complexity makes the game what it is.

I suspect that once I've figured out how to play well, I'll lose interest, but for now, I'm enjoying exploring the game.

I should like this game very much.  It does what it wants to do very well.  I think my problem with it is just that I don't seem to be getting any better at it so it is getting repetitive.  I still like to pull it out once in a while, I should probably try it a few more times.

This is a great little game. I love the small box that it comes in. Makes it handy for travel. It is a very engaging solo experience. I like it more than Agricola, maybe only because it requires far less setup and tear down time. But, it does take up a fairly large footprint for a solo game. Think of it taking up maybe as wide a space as playing regular solitaire with a 52 card deck, but about a 1/4 more table space out from you. This game has a wonderful theme as well.

Surprisingly challenging solo deckbuilder.  Definitely a right way and a wrong way to play this game and win it.  I've beat it on the hardest level, but you need some luck, and don't make any mistakes.  One of the best solo games I've ever played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's a lot of big decisions and lots of game in this little box. Every turn there is an event and first you have to choose whether you want to challenge or lose. Losing allows you to remove cards from your deck but it also removes life points. If you decide to challenge there is still a chance that you'll lose but if you win you get to keep the event card. This way you will strengthen your deck. You don't want your deck too bloated because there aren't that many powerful cards to keep and you don't want your deck too thin because every time you have no more cards to draw you have to add an aging card to your deck which are the worst cards in the game and cost 2 life to remove.

Pros:

-Antoine de Saint-Exupery said "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away" and I think he'd be delighted after playing this game. All the fat has been trimmed and only the absolutely essential gears that cause this game to run have been left behind. This might be the most streamlined game I have ever enjoyed playing. Nothing feels like it has been sacrificed to fit in the box or to meet a certain playing time. It's damn near a perfect design.

-It's portable. All you need are the cards really. The lifepoints can be tracked on paper or you can use coins or M&Ms.

-Don't let the simplicity of the game fool you, this game is hard to beat. I'm more than a dozen games in and I don't have a near fool proof strategy yet. The one time I did win might have had more to do with luck and intuition than it did clinical decision making.

-Almost each card has a special effect which allows you to set up cool combinations when those cards get drawn. Also there are different Pirate abilities so there's a nice selection of end game bosses that will change your strategy according to what you'll be up against.

-I like games with a level system or a timer. In Friday there are three levels of difficulty that you will be advancing throughout the game and this gives me a good guideline to what kind of fight points I should be pulling out of my deck, which makes it easier for me to gauge where I should be.



Cons:

-I don't know why the cards have to be such a weird shape. I thought about sleeving this game but then I looked for sleeves and they don't even make a sleeve this size. What the Hell Friese?

-There isn't a lot of depth here and I'm a guy who likes depth. After you run through the game once there aren't really any rulebook checking or going down different roads to victory in the game and this stuff I love.


All in all Friday is a fantastic little game. It's portable, it's cheap and there is plenty of replayability here.

8/10

Mechanically it's an interesting game.  But the theme is absent, and the "survival on an island" was my prime deciding factor to buy this game.

Very enjoyable solo game with rich decision making -- do you whiff fights to 'learn from them' (i.e.,trim your deck at the expense of receiving crippling aging cards as you cycle through your deck faster), pick challenges you might not stand up to so easily (but will leave you in a terrific position moving forward), take the easy route and hope the pirates you face at the end of the game don't grind you into the ground? All in all, Friday does a really great job of capturing the desert island survival theme and provides interesting decisions (and enough luck and variability so that the game is never solvable) to make for a solid and quick solo game.

RATING: 7.25
Friday is a challenging little deck-builder, with aspects of Thunderstone style themed deck-building, tuned to a solo gaming focus and with a decent dash of Pandemic style deck-driven events.

Players need to thin their decks by losing to island perils, but they also need to accumulate more useful action cards by defeating the island perils, while maintaining a good stock of life tokens and also clearing out the barrier aging cards.

All of this requires some difficult decision making, and a little luck of the decks involved.

The artwork is simple, but appropriate, the price-point is low, and the gameplay is... well, let's just say I haven't won the game yet, or worn it out.

I like this game, but I don't love it- on the other hand I think it does what it sets out to accomplish quite well.

After about 4 games I think this starts at a 6.75 for me.  We'll see whether it grows on me more over time or not.

PS: Noticed a major rules miss on my part, enabling Friday to spend additional lives for more fighting cards, and won for the 1st time on my 8th game.

This greatly enhanced the interest for me- it made it possible to win!- and that change makes this an easy 7.25 rank.

RATING: 7
I like the game mechanism: it's a deck-builder, which you can thin out but there's an adverse effect to thinning (that aging cards come out & get added more often).
The theme is displayed in a lovely way, with humour all around.
I just wish it was partially harder, but it's been neat to play! I'll definitely lend it to my friends and tell them to play it.

An amazingly addictive little game.  You can struggle over many playthroughs, but when you get on a roll and *finally* get to the last pirate ship and your score slowly creeps up towards the goal and you're down to your final life tokens and that final do-or-die card flip puts you over the top...pure joy!

I never thought I'd like a solo game but I love this one. It's going in my backpack to always have with me. The game is super smooth, no accounting (like many other solo games).

I have played twice so far, and it feels further away from a game of "patience" than my only other solitaire game Urbion.  It provides some genuinely interesting decisions.  That said, I doubt a solitaire game could ever score much more than this for me because I definitely prefer playing games with other people!  Perhaps you should consider it to be 7.5/7.5...

A great little solo deckbuilder. Great fun the first few runs but once mastered doesn't offer too much more other than a time killer - The included difficulty variants to add to replayability however, and there are mant self imposed restrictions you could add. The art and theme are good fun!

One of the best solo-game experiences. Though beeing such an unassuming little card game, I will happily choose this over playing most of the other solo games out there, and trust me when I say that I have tried a lot of them. Over the years, this still remains so enjoyable and I´m still getting a liiiittle bit better at it everytime I play :)

This, and my game (LOTR: the adventure deck game) are the only games (both short card games) that I love to play again, again, and again, anytime I can.
I usually play 4-5 games a day of Friday... And I payed 15 euros for it: I certainly got my money's worth.

The game is a lot deeper than one may think at first and lends to lots of decisions, both tactic-wise and strategy-wise. My favorite decisions are when I realize, throughout the game, that I need to thicken my deck, or destro a few aging cards, or that my deck is too slim, and I run into too many aging cards.
The results are visible right away, and it's a lovely feeling, that you get rewarded for planning, and thinking.

Great game.
Dunno how long I'm going to play it, as I think I wore it out, but, it's a great great game.

EDIT: Dropped from 9 to 7: after many (MANY) plays, the game became beatable in SO many ways, I can't play it anymore. I might play it again but I get no more challenge from it. It's a keeper though, as it still is a GREAT game.

Won the easiest level on my 5th try with 82 points, then move to level 3 after that because it's easier to setup than level 2. Won with around 50 points after about 3 tries, with one HP left.
Pros: a good enjoyable compact solitaire game, the final battle with the Pirates feels epic! 
Cons: takes a while to learn to play the game properly. the real enjoyment in this game (for me) comes when your deck is full of goodies, means you must go through a lot of losing the combats to throw away the bad cards on the beginning of each game.

Nice little solo deck-builder. I played only couple of times, but quite enjoyed it. Once I got to play it, I appreciated the cleverness and entertainment of that game, but realized I  not really avid solo gamer. When I would already play a solo game, I don't want only a small deck-builder but something more demanding, which my wife would not normally play.

The classic "get this if you want a solo game with a small footprint". I actually don't get to play it as often as I'd like because I have so many solo games. Just the same I really like having solo games that don't have a real fighting/war theme. I mean, there's fighting pirates and cannibals, but not really.

Played this dozens of times through, got the app to make sure I wasn’t doing something wrong, I wasn’t. Over a hundred plays now and not one win.

RATING: 7
Its a very nice theme, fairly portable, fairly fast and very easy to learn, rules were quite clear mostly and in the end I think its a well designed game, more so than most of the FF titles I have played, this could be his 2nd best!  

The theme comes through a little, but not as much as I hoped without mechanics really supporting it, what you have here is almost a pure deckbuilder. I have not played many other solo type games so don't have much to compare to, but it seems to me things were well thought out here and/or playtested well from what I can tell so far. 

There are some decisions to make here, more so than Onirim for a comparison anyway. You have to decide how fast to trim down your deck, and then how fast to add back to it as well, those are your main over-arching decisions, then there are smaller micro ones that which cards to toast and which to add, how many life points you should spend and when and where to push your luck. So far, these decisions feel meaningful to me, where as in Onirim they did not largely due to luck being too big of factor, its a factor here too of course but much less so far as I can tell for now anyway.

Love this game. It's right beside Imperial Settlers as most addictive solitaire experience. The score keeping is multifaceted so there are multiple goals to work towards, and the deck-building is tempered with simple resource-management. This would be a marvellous thing to give to an only child.

A fun little game to while away an afternoon.  I found the learning curve to be quite steep... game play is dictated by the pirates strength numbers and can vary immensely.

I think that it took eight or nine plays before I even came close to winning and now, after close to 30 plays I can beat Level 1 most of the time.  Level 4 is still a challenge.

Quick set-up and play time mean this title will definitely get more plays than many of the other solo games I own.  A gold star for Friedemann Friese!

I finally did it, picking this up at my favorite game shop in town. It is my first 1 player only game and so far I am very pleased. It is hard, very hard... or I am just really bad at it, but I am having a blast working through the game.

I've played 5 times so far, winning my 3rd game and then trying twice on hard (and getting wrecked). I will be going back to playing the basic game until I perfect my strategy.

Solo deckbuilding done very well. Friday is quite challenging to beat, and it rewards strategic play. I only wish there was more variety and thematic depth to the cards.

Also one of the best rulebooks ever written. Short, precise, explains the game very well and has bonus info from the author.

An exceptional solo game, if you are into that. My go-to when I want to kill 15 minutes. Takes a play or two to grasp the usual FF game rule weirdness, but after that, it is easy to set up, quick to play, and satisfying. Early in the game you want to be defeated by hazards in order to get rid of all the terrible cards you start with, but you still need to get through your first deck run without losing too much life. Losing now to improve your deck for later is what makes this really work.

Brilliantly designed little solo game, possibly one of the best solo games I've ever played, especially for the shorter game range.

Best theme ever for solo game.  I mean, come on, stranded on a desert island?  Perfect!

2015: Downgraded from 8.2 to 6.5.  Didn't stand the test of time.  
While I can appreciate the game design, and how Friese was able to make a solo game more of a game than a puzzle, it just didn't really click with me.  I'm not really into deckbuilding.  And while I do like it, I'm trying to maintain my collection size, which means that there's no reason to have a game I like, when I could switch it out with a game I love.

Traded away along with Field Commander Rommel for Race for the Galaxy.

Neat little game which is easy to bring to the solo gaming table and plays very quick. I'm not a huge fan of deckbuilding but this one feels ok. After a couple of games you have broken the code which makes the game less interesting.

RATING: 9
This game is very clever. I am not a huge fan of deck building games but it works extremely well here. You start with a deck of fighting cards with combat values or -1, 0, 1, and 2. The average strength is zero. Each turn you draw two hazard cards and choose one to battle. Hazard cards have a value you need to equal or exceed with fighting cards, and a number of fighting cards you're allowed to draw for free. You can draw more at the cost of 1 life point each. If you fail to beat the hazard you have the chance to remove some of the fighting cards used from the game. If you win you get the hazard card which has a fighting card printed on it's lower half. 

There are lots of interesting decisions here. Do I want to win the battle or loose to get rid of cards. If I do want to win what are the odds given the current make up of my deck. Am I willing to spend life points to push for victory? 

You go through the hazard deck three times, with the threats increasing in difficulty each pass. Then you must fight two pirate cards which are essentially very challenging hazards. 

The theme is surprisingly well integrated. Each time you go through your deck you age and add an ageing card (sight unseen) to your deck. Ageing cards are bad, but you can get rid of them at a cost.

The game is tough and has a scaling difficulty, giving a good amount of replay value. You calculate a score at the end, but you only win if you can defeat the pirates. I prefer solo games that have a definitive pass/fail ending since this makes for exciting game play, much more so than calculating a number and comparing it to past games. Of course those numbers are interesting too so it seems Friedemann Friese wants to have it both ways here, and I think it works well.

I have only played a handful of times so far, but I am a bit concerned that I will fall into the same style of play every game. I'm not sure how the different pirates will really influence my deck construction. It seems I always want the best cards regardless of which pirates are in play.

I love this game. I can't imagine a better theme in a solitaire game. I feel like I'm coaching Robinson Crusoe. It really turns the Robinson Crusoe concept of colonizing the noble savages upside down. Who is teaching whom after all?

Every decision feels unique and important, with a healthy balancing of deck building and push your luck. If playing alone doesn't turn you away, play this game!

RATING: 2
A tedious game, if indeed it is a game. The theme is tissue-paper thin, and I was underwhelmed by the mechanics. Your decisions are more or less made for you, and you find yourself repetitively and robotically picking cards up and putting them down again without any hope of anything interesting happening. You build a deck that gets better until you lose, or more rarely, until you win. A dull game which if you lose, you feel meh, and if you win, you either feel much the same, unless you feel meh. I ran out of any expectation of fun about 5 minutes into my first game. The art is a crime against eyeballs, even by boardgame standards. The best thing I can say about the game is that the box isn't very big.

Inspired by Robinson Crusoe, you deal with hazards in three increasingly difficult phases. Over time, you can cull bad cards and gain better cards as you prepare to battle two different groups of pirates (different each game). Essentially, this game forces you to manage your health, as it is needed to draw extra cards and is spent when you lose against a hazard. This is a quick and enjoyable solo game.

7-8回プレイしているが、まだレベル１で勝てない。面白いことは面白いが、ソロゲームで一回も勝てないと他の面白さも正しく評価できそうもない。そのため、評価少し辛目。
オニリムにはカードの特殊効果などないことや、拡張ルールがついているのでゲームとしてはオニリムの方が好き。
デッキビルドのシステムは、（ドミニオンよりも）このテーマとあっていると思う。それに、ドミニオンよりもカード枚数少ないから、片付けも楽。それでもPC版があればと思ってしまうが。

何回かトライしてやっとコツがわかって勝てた。だが、他にも勝つルート（こつ？）はあるのだろうか？そう考えると、そのツボを外したら勝てないゲームということで非常につまらないのではないかと思っている。残念なゲームだ。

Nice little solo game - looks kind of unimpressive, but it really is a tough and rather unforgiving deckbuilder with interesting decisions.

Once you were victorious at level 4, it loses this trait, but still remains a great and challenging solo game for every now and then...

Disclaimer: I played 3 times and lost every time. 

Game is hard to win, but very addictive: once you "get it", there is that One More Play feeling. There are enough choices at each turn, theme feels good. At first it may seem there is not much variation in the cards but there is plenty in the combination of the cards.

Manual:  the manual does not take you by the hand. It consists of two leaflets. One shows the setup, the other describes the game round. It is important to sort the cards on the amount of green "hearts" in the corner first, and keep the special -3 very stupid out. The manual does not mention that. I had to re-read the manuals several times, and after watching some yt reviews I finally got it right.

A minus point for the bad manual and the fact that even on easy the game will be too hard for the majority of gamers (let alone the human population).

The game has 22 wooden chits that don't even resemble hearts, but the 2 are never used so what's the use? I can't see how anyone can say this game is repetitive - the pirate ships are very different each time and sensational. 

I bought the dutch version for 10 euro from summoner, sealed and new and all.

Awesome solo deck builder with various levels of difficultly.  I lost in my first play, but that only makes me want to beat this game even more.  I really like how the life tokens are manipulated for losing against hazard cards or for simply for drawing additional Robinson cards.  The ability to thin cards from your deck after a loss is genius.  The three step levels help prepare your deck against the final pirate attack.  Every time though your deck you have to add an aging card.  Everything works beautifully.

Brilliantly designed mechanics and solid gameplay. Friese brings the same important decisions and focus on calculation to this game as to other titles. The game features a 'normal mode' and a 'hard mode', but apart from these, each game is very much like the others (the random pirates don't seem to make much difference to me, but perhaps it's more obvious on hard mode).

An excellent solo that's worth playing (and playing until you win) at least once. I think the replay value is too low to make it a permanent part of my collection.

I played 5 games so far on two separate days, first game was surprisingly good, almost beat both pirates, failing by a life point or two! And then the rest of the other 4 times Robinson were too quick to die.

I feel that this game is heavily rely on how the cards are shuffled and dealt. I am not leave with much options during gameplay and even if you have conserve life points carefully, Robinson can still die quickly. It's a fun game nonetheless. Would recommend this for someone looking for a solo game.

It's a solitaire deck building game.

Users state the following issues: The game is repetitive and there is little choices so it almost plays by itself.

nice solo game.  I usually don't record solo plays of games but as this is solo only, I will.  Reminds me a lot of Pathfinder Adventure Card Game solo.  Both involve weighing sacrificing life against building your deck.  While PAC may be a more interesting game because of the adventure path and persistent characters, I think this offers more interesting tactical decisions.  They play in about the same time.  can I justify owning both?  Friday is much easier to set up.

Also a winner thematically.  I really like how it models how Crusoe overcomes obstacles or deals with failure.  And the aging process.  Really well done.

I was able to pick this up at a neighbor's garage sale.  As it turns out...I still really don't like deck builders all that much.  The game is challenging, but I didn't find the challenge that interesting---the choices in how you build your deck to meet the challenges on living on the island felt very mechanical and I didn't feel the theme coming through (maybe some tenuous connection to becoming "more experienced" over time).

Session Review
First game - first Victory (47 points level 1). A little disappointed because I thought this game is so difficult that you will be crushed in your first games.
Have modify the difficult level. Second Game (level 1) = Victory with 92! Easy going. 

Level 2: it was a better challenge. I get totally crushed in my first game. The second game was very close to victory. 

Game Review
I like the mechanism (deck builder/deck thinning). 
Nice little solo game.

Strong solitaire game, games start to play out similar once you know what you're doing but the variety from the draw and the final pirates as well as the varying difficulty options keep a sense of challenge to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I thought I was good at deck builders. I was wrong. After 6 attempts at the easiest level, I still haven't been able to encounter the pirate ships. This is probably a really good thing though, because once you learn how to beat the game, I feel like each game experience would feel way too similar. 

I really like though how you want to lose hazards sometimes, and ideally by a specific amount in order to cull your bad cards. Also the choices of which hazard to encounter and ability to manipulate what you draw next makes this game have decisions besides deciding what you want to go after and sticking with it as a lot of deck builders have an issue with, although the number of deadweight cards in this game make it hard to get combos going and makes it lose that engine building feel.

Not a fan of the artwork, and when playing quickly since there is very minimal artwork differences it can be easy to miss ability differences between cards.

Out of the first ten plays, I've only won three times.  And that's on the easy level.  My instinct on this game was that there was too much luck in it.  However, I'm getting better at it and realizing there are ways to control the outcomes.  This is a really well designed solo game.  I'd far rather play this than mindless watch a 30 minute sitcom.

Great little solitare game. The first 3 levels did not challenge me but the 4th is proving to be a good challenge. I really like the art in this also. I do hope there is an expansion with a few more cards to mix things up a bit. A couple extra aging cards would be cool (shuffle them remove x cards, different combinations to make it harder).

I've gone from being very lukewarm about Friday to now appreciating what a small stroke of genius it is. I think that realisation has partly come about due to having played more games to compare it to. The art work has grown on me as well, although I'd be first in line if the next print run came with a re-skin. It really deserves it. Admirably tight game design and hard as nails. Love it!

This Rating just went up.  There is way more to this game then at first glance.  Also, I found myself getting more immersed each time I play.  It's as though I'm absorbing the theme.  Gradually introducing aging cards, developing the character, and some repetition (you are trapped on an island!) all makes the game feel like a journey of survival.  Nice.

6-25-16--Lent to James as he is interested in trying out some solo gaming.

5-8-13-arrived yesterday (amazon.com) and tried it out today.  it is fun and addicting.  the only solo game that i have found engaging so far.  (i do play Walnut Grove solo, too, which is OK).  I think i am just more of a social player, like interaction with opponent(s) and miss it when there are none available.

I only got this recently, but it is awesome. I wouldn't compare it to solitaire. You are playing cards from different decks against each other, and rather than building straights from alternating red/black as in Solitaire, there's a whole story going on in Friday, with hazards and events galore.
Great box, great (amusing) cards, neat lifepoints that aren't just generic eurogame pieces, great gameplay, simple rules with a lot of depth and replayability... it's got a lot in a little box.
Couldn't ask for more. Not only the least expensive but also the most fun solo-only game I own (solo-only meaning it is made for 1 player, and no official rules for 2+P exist).

Man, this is a good little game! Small box, relatively few components (and the boards aren't even strictly necessary -- this should travel really well), but lots to think about. Even on a first play it comes in pretty close to its listed play time; it's short but very sweet.

Friday started hitting my radar around the time I began getting tired of deckbuilding, so I initially dismissed it. I'm glad I changed my mind and gave it a shot, because the deckbuilding is incredibly well implemented, not an afterthought in any way, and a lot of fun.

The whole game is fun, in fact. The artwork is charming, the theme is cute, and it's a challenging game even at level 1. It has a puzzle-like quality that I enjoy, and I can see that it's going to be enjoyable to try and conquer it at higher difficulties.

---

Five plays, two wins, and Friday moves from an 8 to a 9. This is a gem, particularly because it can be played so quickly yet delivers a satisfying and challenging experience within its short play time. After a few games I rarely need the rulebook, too.

An okay solo game, with a nice small footprint. Deckbuilding gameplay is solid (I like the idea of adding the aging cards over time, and the economy of cards is nice) but it does feel a little same-y after a while as you're basically always facing the same problem on card after card, just with different numbers. Not a fan of the artwork.

After 8 plays:

Feel like I have the rules and basic strategy down (at least for lvl 1).

A deck building game that essentially involves sacrificing life to toss bad initial cards, while building in more powerful cards (careful consideration needs to be given to when to push for these).  

I quite like how the mechanic ties in with the theme - Robinson's experiences make him stronger in two ways: 1) causing him to lose his weaker traits when he evades a tough encounter, and 2) gaining new strengths when he overcomes encounters.

Plays quickly, very portable.  All up, a nice little game.

Surprisingly challenging and motivating to try just one more time. It took me three games alone to beat the game on level 1. Time will tell though if I give the game another try once I've beaten it...

Browsing through the Friday blog retrospectively, I'm amazed how much of the finished game was there from its very inception.

Great mechanics and theme... This is the best deck builder I've ever played! But there is also something missing. Some games create a memorable story that leaves you feeling like you've experienced something deep and important and others just leave you feeling empty. This game has interesting choices but leaves me feeling nothing.

It is a beautiful piece of machinery but it's not art...

I opened this game for the first time less than two weeks ago and have already played it 18 times.  It's addictive and challenging and so satisfying to win. The first few days I was thinking about it constantly and couldn't wait to get home to play it (we've eaten out way too often these past couple of weeks because of Friday).  

I was excited to teach the game to my son, but now I'm regretting it because he's addicted too and we've only got one copy!

Fun game which scratches the board game itch when there's nobody to play against. What could a more appropriate theme for a solo game?

After over 30 plays, I still haven't mastered this game. Each game really does play out differently, although my life points are always very tight, it seems. The Phase -1 card is a must to do well, win it at all costs!

The battles against the pirates can be a little tedious. It's fun to combine all the different abilities earned throughout the game, but I'll need to figure out a sensible way of keeping track of just how many fighting points are on the table when there are 15-20 cards in play.

The actual game design is outstanding. Would rate it 8 or even higher if the rulebook wasn't such a game in itself (= to figure out how to play correctly - some more pictorial examples and a precise description of which card type is which would have helped for starters, also a glossary of card effects should not be described in a consecutive way but with redundancies). The clumsy rules are accompanied by  clumsy artwork, which I don't like at all – why oh why didn't Maura illustrate this?
But you should ignore the above except for the first sentence: great and hard solo gameplay!

A very enjoyable Solo game. It's not rated higher because I'm not a huge solo gameplayer. I enjoy it on occasion but boardgames are about people as well. That being said, sometimes you just want to pish wooden bits and cards around and there's no one else to play with.

RATING: 8
It's a format solitaire gamers know, but the changes made to the typical structure work so well that it will surely lead to many a forehead slap and an exclamation along the lines of, "why has no one done this before?"  By cards having dual purposes, allowing dangers to be selected, not including specific "this trumps this card, unless trumped by this card" situation, and working through the deck multiple times it completely eliminates the basic issue of entirely being at the mercy of the deck, or in the most basic terms, minimizes the role of luck.  I think it easy to say it established a new standard for this type of solo game

Solo deck builder. As Robinson ages, more bad cards are introduced into his deck, which you have to mitigate by winning challenges against hazards and "destroying" unwanted cards. By game's end, your deck must be strong enough to defeat 2 pirates.

Excellent little solo game.  Allows for some good decision making and a nice mix of strategy and luck.  Since you're only usually dealing with 2-3 cards at a time, luck can play a heavy factor, especially early in the game.  However, I think this helps feed the strategy since you need to make every single card as valuable as possible.

I do find this game to have some interesting challenges and decisions, but I don't think I'll play it too often. If I want to play a boardgame on my own I'm spoilt by a great choice of fantastic iPad versions of games.

This game feels a bit like work, a sort of fine line between a brain-teasing challenge and tedium. The gradual deck-building can feel repetitive. Actually managing all the cards and decks isn't to bad; the game runs smoothly and there is very little set-up (there is lots of shuffling during the game, however).

If I feel in the mood for an 'analog' solitaire experience it'll be by far my first choice. I might just be more inclined to read a good book, that's all.

[u]16-Jan-2013[/u]: Hmmm...what can I say about this [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/blog/1597/mo-plays-friday-100-times]that I haven't already said[/url]?  I love this game.  It's portable.  It's easy on your wallet.  It's fun.  It's challenging.  This is an all around fantastic solitaire game.

Admittedly, this eventually comes down to a game of numbers.  Will your deck be strong enough to beat the ever increasing strength of the hazards you will face along the way?  I think the theme is there if want it to be.  And it is a fun one.  The artwork, while a little cartoony, really does add to the flavor of the game.

If you enjoy deck building games like Dominion and are looking for some solitaire time, this is definitely your game.

A deckbuilder. Wait, keep reading!

You start out with a fighting deck (same deck every time, only shuffled) that kinda sucks. You flip over two hazards and choose one to fight. Do I fight the easier one with my crap deck and get the bonus the hazard provides, or do I lose to the harder one but get to kill the crap cards in my starting deck that I flipped over? If I discard the harder one, I'll have to fight it again after reshuffling the hazard deck, only instead of fighting it on green level, I'll have to fight it on yellow level. But my deck will be much better by that point. Of course, each time you reshuffle your fighting deck, you add in an aging card which can absolutely screw you over at a crucial moment no matter how good your hand is. And say you're fighting a higher-end hazard with your great deck and pull out that aging card. Balls. It doesn't lose the game for me but it might in the next runthrough of the fighting deck. But I really wanted to win this hazard I'm fighting because it provides a +2 life special ability and I'm so close to beating it! So do I lose now so I can kill the aging card (knowing full well that I'll never be able to beat the hazard the next time it comes around on red level)? Or do I eat it and win? There is so much uncertainty and risk management, and it's all so simply laid out! Wonderful game.

*edit* After playing this more and more, I love it. I love pulling it out. I love playing it. It's really grown on me and I can't see it stopping until I master it on the hardest level. I also have played Thunderstone Advance and Mage Knight: Boardgame. While the others have their pros, this game has them beat in terms of the ultimate deckbuilding mechanic. It's perfection! Ok, close to perfection. It's a 9. The only reason I give it 1 mark off is because this is not a game I'll be playing forever. I'll eventually master it and never touch it again. Having said that, attempting to master it is enjoyably addictive!

*update* Having played many other games, this game is still awesome. But I'm lowering it to an 8.5

Was not a fan of this. Seems artificially difficult. The game is built so that you are unable to win encounters early in the game. It's not even a matter of getting lucky and winning against an encounter, it is designed with the intention that you forfeit most of your early encounters. I understand that you should not win all or even a majority of your early encounters but this game is just ridiculous.

I love deckbuilding games, but I am not a fan of this one. The starting deck is so bad it makes you lose a lot of life in the beginning. Trying to randomly draw to a certain number feels like a negative proposition to me. I am way more frustrated at bad draws in this game then any other deckbuilder. I guess you can remember what cards are in your deck and remember which ones have been played already. That is no fun to at all. I hate the art also, the components are pretty good for the price. This game is no fun to me and it makes me angry.

An excellent solo game that implements deck-building really well. Nicely challenging: so far winning about 20% of the time on the easiest two levels.

Holding level 4 in reserve for a final challenge. [41 plays]

Interesting experience - first you don't know what to do but afterwards it really flows well, won twice on easy mode - will try more difficult modes afterwards. Good thing is that Willem can already start playing this game all alone by himself.

The game itself is a sort of deckbuilding - where you try to cull your deck of cards, adding better ones in and removing the weaker ones, trying to optimize your deck by the time the pirates attack the island.

Similar to Jason Rohrer's video game "Gravitation," (and unlike some of "Dominion") almost every mechanic in this game represents an aspect of a person stranded on an island. Friday is an excellent example of multiple cycles interacting, and as of now, I want to play a lot more of this game! Kind of surprised that the concept of multiple interacting decks in a deck-builder doesn't exist elsewhere, to the best of my knowledge.

I really love this game.  It's a character-builder/deck-builder game, and it changes every time you play it.  You are playing against the game - just like traditional solitaire - so don't expect to win very often.  But the ebb and flow of the game is really solid - with the character of Robinson beginning as a dummy without many skills, and gaining skills as you beat challenges.  But beware, take too long to beat challenges, and Robinson ages - causing him to take minuses!  It's really tricky to play to gain good cards while also removing bad cards.  Strategy is key!

Interesting solitaire deck builder.  The first time I played it, I had to refer to the rules a lot until I got more comfortable with the game (I won with 14 points).  My second game was smooth and I lost to the first pirate. It comes in a compact box and can be played on a small area so it will be perfect for overnight business trips.

RATING: 6
Fun little solo deckbuilder with a decent sense of humour in the cards ("Islands for Dummies", anybody?) and a wonderful mechanic whose subtleties only gradually become apparent.  As I have drifted away from LOTR: The Card Game because of the deck-building and layer upon layer of exception text (even though it is the better game) this has come into its own.  Whether it will live enough over 50+ games remains to be seen, but it has had a good start, even if I clearly have some way to go to get on top of the strategic considerations.

Update:  I have drifted back to LOTR and now doubt that this will survive to 50 plays.  It's ok but never really grabs me, and I am rarely emotionally involved in the outcome.  It is a poor relation to LOTR in terms of expression of theme, I suppose.

A cooperative solo game with a nice theme and manageable influence of luck.
The four levels of difficulty do not add that much. If you lived long enough playing through the stack twice, you already know that you are going to win. To get there, however, is pure luck of drawing.
Still, I like the game for what it is, and the components are great.

It was okay but I tend to dislike the randomness of the card flips semi co op games like this (essentially a 1p co op). I suspect I'd prefer playing something like Forbidden Desert solo personally.

This just didn't grab me and I suspect I'm not much of a solo gamer. Solo games also have a higher rules:play ratio since they need more Rules making an AI, which is annoying a bit.

Anyway decent. A bit push your luck based and not a ton of strategy imo...eventually with enough plays you'd def win.

This game never leaves my suitcase. I frequently travel for work and this is the perfect game to satisfy my board game fix. The game box is quite small and can easily be played in a small area. I was surprised that a box this small could contain a good deck building experience. Personally I find the game quite challenging and the difficulty can easily be customized.

I recommend this game to anybody who travels frequently and enjoys deck builders.

As any small solo game, it has its limitations, but it does what I wanted it to do; give me something interesting I can play by myself, sitting in an indoor playground while my kids are getting rid of some surplus energy (or a similar venue).

It's Mini-Dominion!  Like Dominion, the idea is to create a tight little income (or strength) generating engine.  However, the addition of the life point system in Friday makes it a little less forgiving than Dominion.  

About 10 plays in on the easy level and I've only made it to the pirate ships once.  Despite all the losing, I keep coming back for me....and clearly I've got my work cut out for me.

Over time, my interest has waned.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] Level 1 alone was a challenge at the start. (4 plays required for first win.)  Nice design with a decent deck building theme (final pirate battle has a swashbuckling feel to it if your deck is solid...  And, the artwork grows on you quite a bit over time.  Now, back to my peaceful island...  [Level 1 Win Score: 63] Level 2 - One attempt so far... Second attempt was better - made it to yellow - but a high value card taxed my abilities and ended the game...  Game is currently "slightly" addictive.  Third - dead.  Forth - dead (2nd phase, but still dead...).  Fifth - still dead.  The aging cards are really tough to deal with...  This game ended with card 1 = Stop!  Ouch!  Sixth/seventh/eigth - more of the same.

Also numerous sessions via iOS application on iPhone.

This is a really good solitaire puzzle.

The replay value is high, comparable to the card solitaire game Golf.  The cards are holding up nicely, too.  The time to play vs reward/effort is high, again much like typical standard card solitaire games.

I have only gotten to Level 2 and still enjoying it greatly.  I wish I could get this in an electronic version.

Why this is not a 10:
-> too light-weight
-> zero interaction (duh!)
-> I need a mental break!
-> like card solitaires, I need variety after a while
+ its' best attributes are its' worst faults!  short, simple, solo, challenging

While I cannot rate it a 10 for BGG, I highly recommend this for solo play.

It is a solitaire game that doesn't introduce any revolutionary concept. It's just a deck building game with a push your luck element added onto it, and some other twists. For example, you will spend life points to filter your deck, and once you exhaust it you will add aging cards that will penalize you; if you filter it too thin, aging cards will kill you.

It's a matter of finding a balance bewteen these concepts and some others, and forming a deck able to defeat the always difficult final enemies.

Once you figure out the balance needed to beat the game, it's a matter the draw of the luck. There are several final enemies, but they are too similar. And as I said, solo games are not my cup of tea. That means its replay value is quite low for me.

The manual has some holes, some things are not well explained. The cards are OK, they have an odd size that fits their content. The mats are not necessary and the life points wooden tokens are wheat spikes... Why?

心得:
蠻不錯的單人算牌遊戲
主要策略應該是在第一輪用完自己牌庫時
盡量把0跟-1的牌清掉
phase-1的牌不一定要有
+2牌跟+1或是+生命牌都蠻強的
第二輪自己的牌盡量要想辦法拿sort或exchange還有destroy
後期看情況可能也要清掉些低攻擊力的牌
另外策略點是不一定要抽到免費抽得牌數，要看狀況停止
規則:
1.起始將老化牌分強度洗勻，最強的三張放下面，剩下七張放上面(-3拿掉)
2.隨機抽兩張海盜牌，難度牌黃綠紅疊在一起
3.個人牌堆，探索牌推各自洗勻，照難度拿生命
4.每回盒抽兩張探險卡，則一探險根據目前難度得數字，跟該探險卡可抽的免費卡抽牌，抽牌一張一張抽，免費牌數可不抽滿，免費牌放左邊
5.可用1生命抽一張牌，牌放在探險牌右邊
6.牌的功能使用完後橫置
7.功能結束後，成功把所有剩下牌根探險牌丟進棄牌推，失敗，數值差多少掉多少命，且可移牌出遊戲
8.剩一張探險牌時可選擇挑戰或不挑戰，結束後難度提升一級，紅色難度完就挑戰海盜
9.每次牌庫不夠抽就加一張蓋著的年老卡並洗牌
10.贏兩個海盜，或是生命低於0(可等於)，或是全卡用完打不贏海盜皆結束遊戲
11.抽牌能力放在右邊，每張雙倍只能作用在一張卡，排序三張可看下三張任意排序，且可棄一張，交換棄一張抽一張，交換兩張如果要用第一張來換第二張，第一張能力不可用，放在牌庫底如果是拿免費牌，可補抽一張
12.四個難度 A: 20命 B: 隨機加一張年老卡 C: -3年老卡洗入年老牌堆 D: 18命
13.記分:所有牌數值相加，年老卡總是-5 + 15分一張海盜卡 + 5分每命 -3分每張沒完成的探險卡

A deck builder that's so finely tuned that every decision you make, and you make one every turn, seems vital. You start with a deck of mostly bad cards. Each turn you flip two encounters and choose one of them to "battle" (ie flip x cards and you need y points on your flipped cards to win). Win, and the card you just bought gets added to your deck - it'll be better than the cards you have plus it'll have a cool power (like draw more cards, double another card's points, etc). Lose, and you lose life points (you only have so many) but as compensation you get to thin your deck and remove low value cards (which you also need to do). But you don't get the cool new card. And you're only allowed to thin if you have enough life points left to spend. Lose all of them and you've lost. So sometimes you aim to lose, sometimes to win, and knowing which when seems the key to the game. To win, you need to get through the encounter deck three times (and each time the score needed to win gets higher) and then beat two big boss pirate encounters. And each time you go through your deck, a bad card gets added, so you may not want to thin your deck too much, or take too many cards with powers to draw more cards. Finding the right balance given how the cards come out (and there's obviously a bunch of luck in that) is the charm of the game. It adds replay by having 4 levels of difficulty to work your way up, each level seemingly a small step, but it's surprising how big a difference that small step makes. It's good value if you enjoy patience type solo games.

"Clever portable solo deckbuilding game. Randomized pirates, plus optional difficulty levels, give this game replayability."

What I like:
- Portable
- Interesting decisions
- Different pirates each game
- Increasing difficulty levels as you get better

What I don't like:
- Being a strictly solo game is limiting
- Hard to remember which phase you are in at first
- A couple rules could have used streamlining

The BGG-voted weight of 2.1 seems reasonable. Initial rating of 8 will probably slip to 7, simply because it's a solo game.

Just got it with Speicherstadt (16/03/2012) and it looks like it could be quite fun. I like the game components.

Tricky thing this one... a nice solo deck building game (one more) to pass the time when I'm on my own. The difficulty level seems pretty harsh as long as you haven't figured out what the best strategy is (my case). I really like the components that come in the box. The tiles on which to place the cards are totally unnecessary but a very nice addition! FF could have just thrown in the cards but did a little extra there for visual appeal, which is very thoughtful! He's clearly trying to buy his place into player's hearts :D Well done Friedemann!

- A noteworthy comment on the rules: Well done FF!! A clear improvement over all the other rules you have made us read so far! Much less confusing than anything I read before coming from 2F. CONGRATULATIONS!

[b]Nice solo fun[/b]

I have given this game away. I still think it's a great game but I'm finding I rather do something else when I'm on my own than playing solo board games :)

I got to thinking “this is a 10” after about 6 to 8 plays. It took time to appreciate the genius design of this game. It takes some plays to understand rules and card instructions and nuances. When you do everything clicks and each game is quick and full of hurrahs or aws. It’s smooth how you as Friday help Robinson get over his weaknesses and guide him to gain experience. As that goes on aging takes place but when guided well it is countered by the use of tools, expertise, and better weapons. If all is chosen well you lead Robinson to dominate the island. This grueling exercise in turn prepares him for the final battles against the pirates. In my case for every time i felt that something was too hard or too easy or that it didn’t make good sense I stopped and took another look at the rules and at the posts on bgg. This answered all questions that I had and the next two or three plays elevated the experience to a ten. Friday is a great game!

Fun solo deck builder.  Quick play and engaging, but starts to feel repetitive after a while.  You kind of have to follow the same strategy each game (thinning out bad cards while trying to keep your life points up), but there is a ton of game to game variability in setup and the luck of the draw. Card powers are fun and chaining them is even more fun.  For solo play vs other solo games and/or games that you can play solo, I give it an 8. I recommend as a solitaire game to absolutely anyone, especially for the price.

Rating after the first 5 games! Well done Solo-game! I like that the game gives the player the feeling of being able to decide for a strategy. Not just pure luck, even if there must be a high luck factor in a game like this! The theme is fresh, even if a bit absurd (if the only motivation of Friday really is to get his peace back why not shove Robinson from a cliff and being done with it? ;-) ) The only two nitpicks are that there could be more variety in the different adventure-cards. But maybe Friedemann is keeping them for an expansion? ;-)
Second the rules could be clearer in some points!
After 11 games I updated my vote: This is a clear 8 for me! Very well done!

I've had a handful of plays of this game and each time I play it, the more I seem to dislike it. I'm not a huge solo gamer to begin with, but it feels very repetitive to me. It's rather difficult and can be frustrating.

Plus, I'm rather annoyed that the card size was unsleeveable. You make a card game that I can't sleeve and needs to be shuffled often. Ugh.

This game is quickly solved in the base strategy. After determining a robust winning strategy, most games are a win. There is certainly some room to improve the final score, with some nuance in detail decisions. Getting to develop a robust strategy is fun, however. I only lost once to the pirates. If I lose, it's during the first two deck cycles.

My rating is a hybrid between the fun I had exploring this game (8) and my intentions to go back to it, now (6).

Since most deck-builders seem to be almost solo games anyway, this is a great fit, and I'm certainly not a solo gamer. The way the end-game pirates force some deck customisation avoids the thin-as-possible strategy that seems to dominate most deck-builders. One of those games where you feel you have to win a game before packing back up after a session.

A lot more fun than it deserves to be. I like deckbuilding/card drafting games when they are well done, and this fits that bill. It can be a tense fight to stay alive, or a push for a high score. Maybe that's just my uneven play. Somehow, this feels oddly thematic to me, though there is no sensible reason it should be. Nevertheless, I find myself spinning a narrative while playing, which makes this a really enjoyable solo 20-30 minute experience. Never play Klondike solitaire again!

Some very clever twists on deck building with the penalty for each time you go through your deck and the unknown cards that get added. 
There's definitely a skill to develop and the simple setup and ruleset is very nice. After a few wins, though, the mystery starts to clear up and the limitations of the deck building mechanism start to appear.

This is a terrific strategy solo card game! It is designed with a number of difficulty tiers that allow you to scale as your skill increases. Unlike many solo games, this is dynamic enough to maintain interest, yet challenging enough to provide a rich sense of accomplishment when you succeed in getting Robinson off the island. All this, and it's compact enough to take anywhere. 

This is a must have for all solo gamers!

Clever solo game. There are always options to weigh - you may even want to lose fights. You get better at it, but don't feel like you're solving it. If there's a dominant strategy, I don't know what is is (yet). The theme is light, and I stopped paying attention to thematic text by the second play.

A fun little solo-only card game. Called a deck-builder by some, but I don't really agree all the way. You have some good cards and some bad cards in your deck, with the goal of thinning out the bad ones. Not much decision there.

The game, however, does present you with plenty of choices and can be difficult at times. I'm not a fan of the artwork at all. Also, there are some finicky timing rules and things that are obviously an artifact of less-than-perfect rules translations. The BGG rules boards will oblige, but still a ding against it.

1st, 2nd: had my ass handed to me almost everytime. I'm starting with 22 life and still can't seem to get anywhere! still fun!!!

3rd: was able to beat the game with 22 life. my strategy was to whittle down the the hard challenges and hope for the phase-1 card to reappear. Finally, it was easy to pass the red-phase and on to the pirates.

4th game: started with 22 life. beat it with lots of life to spare. Had 2 fairly easy pirates.

5th game: started with 20 life but had to end game prematurely because I accidentally cheated. The phase had increased to yellow and I forgot to fight at that level for quite a few hands. I was wondering why I was doing so well!

Cute little solo deck builder I got for when I'm alone, but I'm finding wanting to play Alien or Ghost Stories instead when those times come. It's a bit repetitive at times...draw card, okay yeah, explore the island again, draw. crap! draw. crap! draw...etc

I just find the level of excitement to be ever so constant. Other solo games or co-op games with solo variants have an element of stress building or random chance that hits you in the face or keeps you on the edge. This one I find is a bit mellow and I'm just sitting there drawing cards, getting frustrated at my dwindling health chips haha.

I must be missing a gene when it comes to deck building games. Because so many of them (over)reward deck thinning, which is to me the exact opposite of building a deck. So what gives? What am I doing? Deck building, or deck thinning? I do remember sitting on my office floor playing this game, excitedly losing and trying again, and then again, and it occurred to me as I lost a bit of enthusiasm each time that I was never going to enjoy this, as it was pretty much going to play the same way every time, with the exact same "thin your deck early" strategy. I'll take a plain ol' deck of cards for solitaire still. Or some of the Oniverse games. But this one was a disappointment. I learned the game and then over three plays it taught me to not care anymore.

Takes way too long for what it does. Also, hard.

Card size is an abomination. Don't expect to sleeve.

Found out I'm never willing to play the game because of how long it takes but at the same time how inconsistant playtime is due to losing before reaching the yellow period.
The first turns are boring and always play the same. And losing to them is annoying. Definitely a miss for me.

I do not like games that are puzzles you don't win until you figure them out. I like games that are fun regardless of how many times you play them, win or lose. And this fails to deliver. It's a challenge you want to win. Until you don't, it's a boring math fiddly thing that takes 20 minutes too much.

I'll stick with Onirim for a small card game with low footprint. Much more replayable and enjoyable.

I don't really have a lot of solitaire games to compare this one to, besides cooperative games. I can say, the art is to cartoony and corny for me, and the theme is average at best. The gameplay is solid. I am not sure that this game will have a lot of replay-ability though. The second problem with this game is that it outstays its welcome. Each game takes me about 45 minutes, or more, to play and I am moving at a decent pace. This time is with me usually losing about 3/4s of the way through. The theme, art, and even gameplay is not worth 45 minutes. It would be much better at 25 minutes. I see how the box says 25 minutes. I'm not saying this is a bad game, I'm just saying that for it's length I would probably just rather play Legendary, Flash Point, or Pandemic solo instead of this one most of the time. Still a nice addition to the collection that will get a couple plays most months. Its one of those games you sit in front of the TV and a watch some football for a few hours and play two leisure games of. ***

First game was fine, second even better, thirds was fun - but then it always felt samey. I'm not a big fan of solitaire games, but there are some which I enjoy (check Shadi Torbey's stuff, "Onirim" and the rest). This one became boring after several games, to the point I just don't think I will every play it again. 

As to the mechanics: it's a simple deck builder (something I normally enjoy, but not here for some reason). You start with a horrible deck of cards and try to trim it by intentionally loosing encounters. There are some decisions involved - when to give up and when to draw more cards at the expense of life points - but for me, it became automatic. Sold it!

Christmas 2014 from Mum and Dad.

Excellent little solo game that I have had a lot of fun with. It is fun to build up your deck and then use the cards that you have stretched and strained to acquire. Later turns have a nice problem solving edge and the outcome is always so finely poised that a tight game is almost assured.

It is hard to imagine a better solitaire game coming out of a small deck of cards so, for that reason, I have to score it highly. It wouldn't be fair to compare it to a big sprawling eurogame.

I won't usually take the time to play a single-player game, but Friday was a pretty fun romp in the shoes of Crusoe. Very challenging. I think it will take a few more plays to even be able to beat the easiest difficulty level. Need to take chances earlier in the game instead of saving all the tough cards for the end. On a side note- the rulebook could use some reworking to make things more clear.

Solo deck building game. The game has three stages:

RATING: 8.5
Rule book is pretty bad as it has a lot of translation problems so it took a while to slog through this despite it being relatively short.  Interesting game just for the fact that it really seems to take a few plays to get the hang of this.  I know there is a very well thought out game in here but since i lost so bad on the first play I need to play a few times to even determine if it is fun.  I hope after a few plays it ends up a being the short little intriguing solo filler I was hoping for.  

after the second play I got to the first pirate and lost badly.  It is a really interesting game and definitely a solo deck building game.  There seems to be a really tight window when determining when to get rid of cards and lifepoints and gain cards to you deck.      This game is just intriguing and fun.  

Update:  I thought the rules were a little more stringent than they actually are.  I realized this on the last turn of my forth game.  I didn't actually break the rules but I was making it much more difficult.  This is a great little game that really captures the theme in a very well done deck building (or molding) style.

Wow.

This is a well-thought out concept for a solo game. Brilliant design. There couldn't BE a more fitting theme.

When you overcome a hazard, you gain a valuable skill (fight card). When you fail, you lose health, but also learn from your mistakes (rid yourself of bad cards)

The gameplay has choices with consequences, with an excellent deck-building mechanic.

 3 epochs and a boss level provide a rich and satisfying experience.

Friday was 'fun enough'. What I do recall from my first play(s): The learning curve seemed, at first, staggering. Many repeat losses later and suddenly you start to venture into the yellow danger level, then red, and all at once you taste the encounter against the final pirate ship...only to lose. However, that taste was enough for me to persevere. I knew it was possible. Through diligence, and a little providence, I was indeed able to attain a win. And again. And again. So there seems to be a certain tried-and-true path to victory in this game. However, that does not help its case in seeing time on the table once more.

After a lucky first win and then getting thrashed a couple of times, I started to get to grips with helping RC to survive. I am not a gamer who searches for the strongest strategy in any sort of methodical way and I like that Friday supports intuitive play, where most of the time I just go with my gut instinct, while avoiding stupid decisions. On this level the game is fairly winnable but still reasonably challenging. 

So yes, for me it's a fun play. The theme is cleverly intergrated and reasonably immersive. A couple of games easily clock in at less than an hour. If this sounds like you, give it a go and also check out "Lord of the Rings - The Adventure Deck Game", which is another solitaire that is mildly challenging and similarly fun. I know I'll be entertained by both these games for years to come.

RATING: 6
lacks much depth, but it's very clean.  IF you start with more health, the game gets easier (obviously) but also much more strategic (not obvious, but seems to be true).

With more life, you can make more sacrificial plays and bold trade-offs, instead of just skimping by and hoping for good luck.  I find that the game is much better that way, even though I usually like solo games to be brutally hard.

Who ever thought losing so often would be so enjoyable ... wait what?

I've lost each game I've played and for some reason I just keep coming back.  Each time I get a little better at it and I know it's possible to win.  It's like a puzzle almost.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Brilliantly designed cards and boards 
- - SUPER clever use of space and design to make the cards not only easy to read and distinguish but also allow for dual purposed cards. 
- - Cards are easily sorted back out once a game is over.
- - Boards show symbolically what you do with their corresponding decks.

- Really clever mechanics 
- - Escalating difficulty.  Robinson ages each time his deck runs out (getting another bad card) and a new difficulty phase begins each time the hazard deck runs out.
- - Purposely lose at a hazard to 'learn from it' and get rid of bad cards.  Or get cards with the 'destroy' ability to allow you to weed out bad cards on the fly.
- - Special abilities on cards allow you to make some pretty cool combos

- Losing multiple times does not detract from the experience.  It merely makes me want to play more to refine my techniques.

- Scalable difficulty overall; once you've 'mastered' Level 1, there are several more levels of difficulty to try.

- Great for travel:  Small footprint and small storage.  Easy to take anywhere.  No noisy components.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- If you do not like losing a lot, this might not be the game for you.  Losing frequently when first learning the game is common.

- No sleeves available.  If you are a sleeve fiend, there are currently no sleeves available for these.  They're out of print and there is only one maker who has sleeves for them since they are an odd size.  However, this is not necessarily bad.  Since the cards are white/grey core and white-ish bordered, they do not show any obvious marking even after many play-throughts of the game.  I can riffle-shuffle them to my heart's content and not care too much about getting dings on the edges.  It just would have been nice with sleeves since those help when shuffling smaller decks.

This is my first solo only game that I purchased a deep twist on solitaire that makes the game interesting with all its different activities going on.  You play Friday helping Robinson Crusoe make decisions to survive on the island.  The game gets progressively challenging but is a fun little solo game.

Direkt rákerestem, és ahogy a BGG helyezések mutatják, azt kell mondjam, kifejezetten csak és kizárólag solitaire játékot alkotni művészet!
Eléggé egy "elfajzott" dolog ez, elsősorban wargame műfajban találni ilyen játékokat. Azt gondolom, hogy a Friday egy igazán egyedi, és különleges darab, a fentiek pedig csak megerősítenek ebben.
A játék megvalósítását tekintve azonban lehetne kiválóbb is (gondolok itt arra, hogy talán nem kellett volna teljesen egyedi, "nyújtott" kártyaméretet használni, illetve, hogy létezik ennél jobb minőség is - miért nem műanyag lapok???). Ezeket az apróságokat leszámítva viszont nagyon jól elszórakoztat az egész. A Robinson kerettörténet többé-kevésbé illik is az egészhez (igaz, hogy a végén miért kell kalózokkal harcolni az rejtély).
Aranyos egy darab, Friese mesternek sikerült egy igazán egyedi dolgot alkotnia. Javaslom, hogy mindenki próbálja ki, még akár az lelhet benne szépséget, aki idegenkedik a solitaire-ektől.
A szerencse szerepe koránt sem nevezhető elhanyagolhatónak, de hát ez természetes velejárója annak, ha az ember egy lakatlan szigetre vetődik ;) Előny ezzel szemben a gyors setup és a 15-20 perces, rövid játékidő (szemben mondjuk egy normál társas egyszemélyes variációjával).

My rating is very much related to the fact that it's a 1P game.  In other words it is great for what it is and I'd rather play it than most any other 1P game with the same time frame.  It's fast, short, & smart but with a serious challenge.  Friday and Mage Knight tend to be the only games I play alone, obviously two very different games but excellent, one short the other long.  I'm generally not playing much alone but when I do I have my go to games...Happy!

One of the better solo-only games out there. It's essentially a deck builder, which isn't easy to do with just one player.

RATING: 8.5
This game is amazing. A solo deckbuilder that plays in about a half hour and offers incredibly difficult choices. It's so good the way it penalizes you for drawing more cards, both by giving up precious life points, and then ultimately by drawing aging cards. The tough part is that you may need to draw more cards to defeat the hazard, which will then turn into a GREAT card for you. Do you burn through your deck quickly just in the hopes of getting that valuable 4 strength attack card, but take an aging card and lose a couple life points in the process??? These decisions are not simple or obvious in any way. This game is amazing.

Great solitary game by Friedemann Friese! And a hard one ... I can tell. The gameplay is so simple but there are tough decisions to be made and in the end you lose in most cases. Nevermind: just try again to get rid of Robinson! I really can recommend this to people who want a solo experience which is played in a short amount of time and which is nevertheless more tactical than you might think.

Loved the first game, even though I  Got disgustingly beat, but it was a fun loss. I seee myself playing this little game for a while, as I have a lot to explore before beating level 4. 

I've gotten creamed in my 4 games.. Very tough. I like that though, means replay value will be high. 

Finally won a game, but what a sad score lol. This game is tough.

There's a lot about this game that usually wouldn't appeal to me (solo play, deck building) but it seems to work. Play is quick and fairly straightforward once you have the hang of it. Of my first 4 plays, I managed to beat the game once. More importantly, I want to keep playing...

:d6-1:  heard this was fast, and a great one. Especially for playing multiple times.

Fast,easy setup, are big pluses in my big. Setup doesn't automatically kill a game, but it makes it need some area to really shine in to offset it, or be pretty good in a couple other areas.

I enjoy this a lot as a puzzle because it rewards calculated risks. You can't win by being passive in this game -- you need to use card counting to your advantage.

The only bad side is that once you get on a roll, the games tend to play out the same way each time. I only play once a week (on Friday) at most so that's no biggie.

It took me long to like Friday. After the first two sessions I was about to rank it 5, but I decided to give it a few more tries. That has been a good decision. Friday is fantastic solo card game. It comes in a small box, has minimal setup time, plays in 15 - 30 minutes (I am sure that experienced gamers can play it in 10 minutes), and doesn't get boring. The decisions to make are not obvious but not too complicated either. It is a mixture between skill (craft and optimize your deck) and luck (card draws).

Perfect for a quick solo play.

When I am having more time, I will go for a round of Mage Knight.

Btw, Inception is another fine solo card game. And it is PnP.

Overall a good solo game.  I haven't played it enough to understand the long term replayability, but it took me about four plays before I figured the base strategy and won a game starting at easy level.  It actually hit the spot one time when I really wanted to game and had no opponents.

Knackeschweres Solitärspiel mit Deckbuilding-Mechanik von Friedemann "Funkenschlag" Friese. Gefällt mir auf den ersten Blick recht gut und wird noch für eine Menge Durchgänge gut sein.

RATING: 8
For a solo game this is a very good effort. Decisions right at the beginning are a bit obvious, but then get more and more challenging as you progress. It's quite tricky and the game is good that way because after many plays it's not getting boring because it's a challenge. After a couple of games you do sort of work out the better way to play, yet it remains enjoyable as something to play that's light and easy with regular tense moments where you wait to see if the right card will turn up. I'd really like to see this as an iOS application so I could play it again and again while travelling because it also happens to be rather addictive. Nice small box and low price for a good game make it a real winner. I've played it happily as a cooperative game with my eight year old and playing that way helps if you're feeling a bit dubious about the whole solo game experience as it becomes a cooperative experience.

Very euro.  Very dry, nonexistent theme.  But I absolutely love it.  Every game plays completely differently, every time I finish a game I want to play again.

8/15 after several more plays, I'm not getting any better at this.  not sure how I feel any more...It's probably just me.  Smart design, not sure how much fun it really is though.

Played this thing way too many times before I finally beat it.  Even now it's still tough.  Fun little solitary game, the rules are a little tough to follow, but the board here at BGG helps with some research and most questions you might have are probably already answered there.  Just don't lose any of those little life tree pieces, I have no idea where you'd get more of those.  Lose a couple and you'll have to swap them all out for some glass counters or something.

A great solo card game.  Use your cards to try and survive on an island.  Victory gets you more powerful cards while defeat costs you life points, but also a chance to dump those weak cards.  Very thematic for a simple card game.  Can you become strong enough to defeat the pirates in the end?!

RATING: 7
Fun at first but once you find a strategy that works is comes down to implementing the strategy with little decision making. My strategy is go for the expensive cards. Use them to get free draws to clean out the garbage cards. If a card is not won with the free draws in the first round, let it go, maybe draw one or two more to get rid of more garbage cards. You then have enough points to easily get any card in the later rounds. After figuring this out, that game is pretty mechanical.

You are cast as Robinson Crusoe, struggling to survive on a tropical island. When you encounter a hazard, such as wild animals or cannibals, you use the cards in your hand to combat it. If you succeed, the hazard card goes into your discard pile and become available to you after the next shuffle; that's pretty standard deck-building fare. But in a clever twist, you can also improve your deck by losing to hazards, because it is then that you can remove bad cards from your deck entirely.

Thematically, you get stronger as you overcome challenges, and you "learn from your mistakes" when you fail. Very clever, and quite addicting.

[17 games] First game, I lost. I lost badly. It is going to be fun trying to get good at this game. I've enjoyed solitaire card games occasionally over the years, and this looks like a meatier, more open decision tree. 

Second game I learned a bunch, but I still have a long way to go before I'm playing really well. I love that there is some meat to chew into here.

3rd play. Lost against 2nd pirate. Getting better ... maybe.

Next 9 plays. Trying new strategies and usually getting worse scores. There is some meat to this game! I have yet to triumph against both Pirates.

Most recent play Sept '13.

RATING: 7
A fantastic solo game. Easy to learn and easy to set up. Not so easy to win. Varying levels of difficult to ensure replayability, and it includes a score sheet so you can track your progress. 

My main complaint is the amount of space it takes to play- can be quite a lot once you fight the pirates. Keeping track of all your abilities and fighting points also becomes tedious once you reach the pirates.

"[b][thing=43570]Friday[/thing][/b]" is a really slick deck-building designed by [person=141]Friedemann Friese[/person] (yep, the same guy that created "[thing=2651]Power Grid[/thing]").  I've played "[thing=36218]Dominion[/thing]" quite a bit with my gaming friends, but the novelty started waring off pretty quickly after playing other deck-building games such as "[thing=53953]Thunderstone[/thing]," "[thing=69789]Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer[/thing]," and "[thing=68425]Eminent Domain[/thing]."  I grew tired of sitting around the table and more or less playing a multi-person solitaire game.  After all, if I wanted to play a solitaire game, then I should just do that on my own when nobody else was available to play, right?  Okay, there's more to those other games and it's not that I dislike deck-building games, but I'd rather use the time with other people to play a more interactive game.  However, "Friday" is an excellent way to scratch the deck-building itch by myself.  This game is packed full of strategy and theme and is another game that's [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/video/13965/friday/]easy to learn[/url], but REALLY difficult to win!

 Bought this in order to study the deck building mechanic as I am considering using it for some project of my own. Nice small box solo game, provides an interesting challenge and it's pretty short so you don't feel like you've wasted a lot of time on it. I guess that when I start to beat it regularly I'll pass it to some friend as a gift.

 On the negative side, the theme is blah and the artwork is very childish, to an extent that it's annoying when one plays the game.

Nehéz objektíven megítélni egy egy játékos játékot, mint társast. Nálam nagyon fontos a társaság, azért játszom elsősorban. Nem nagyon ülnék le sokszor egy ilyen játékhoz, még ha nagyon jó is volna. Ettől függetlenül Friese játéka tényleg jóra sikerült. Sima pakliépítő pasziánsz, aminek nagyon jól eltalált a nehézsége. Az első szintet is csak ötödikre tudtam megnyerni és még van három nehézségi szint. Így, aki szeret maga játszani annak sokáig jó kikapcsolódás lehet. Sok múlik a szerencsén is. Aki szeret maga játszani mindenféleképpen próbálja ki. Objektíven lehet több pontot érne, de nálam nem kaphat többet egy egy személyes játék.

Friday is a very interesting take on deckbuilding and one of the best combinations of mechanisms and theme that I have ever seen. The game forces you to make some tough decisions about how to improve your deck and manage your food. It takes a few games to get the hang of  how to play optimally, but once you do, it's quite enjoyable. Ultimately, the game suffers from being too easy to predict once you understand how it works. By the time I hit the last level of difficulty, I pretty much did the same things every game with luck being the primary factor in whether I won or lost.

I must say, I watched a how-to-play video by eekamouse and I was not sure if I'd like it. It looked interesting, but I didn't know how fun it'd be... My initial impressions were wrong. This is a fun game! There are some interesting decisions to be made. It took me 5 tries to beat it on level one, and after 6 total plays I plan on progressing to level 2. I imagine this getting some good play time for those times when I don't have others to game with. Highly worth the $20 price tag.

Friday is an interesting take on deck building.  In this solo you are helping Friday, who was marooned on a dessert Island. You have a small deck of starting cards that have a fighting value and maybe some special ability.  You have to fight through progressively more difficult challenges all the while adding cards to your deck.  As you pass challenges, you add the card to your deck which makes the deck better.  Oh you can fail challenges too, which makes you lose life, but you also get to cull your deck of crappy cards.  

All in all it is a fun little card game I can play while watching a football game or some such.

I really enjoy Friday - even if I find it quite hard and it regularly kicks my ass.  This is my go-to solo game.  It's a pretty small package, so it fits into whatever bag I'm travelling with or taking to the pub.  It's easy to set up, plays pretty quickly, and always keeps me entertained.  I can see this being a staple for a while.

Absolutely great little solo game. It really shows that this is designed as a solo game, when compared to solo variants of most multiplayer games. Just a lovely little game that I'm very happy to have on my shelf.

Friday is a highly addictive little solo game. The theme is very thin - despite having read Robinson Crusoe several times as a boy, I feel no immersion whatsoever. The appeal is strictly from the delight found in solving difficult little problems.

There are 4 levels in the published rules, with apparently minuscule changes from one to the next, but in practice you find that the game truly is that finely tuned. There is also a 5th level, suggested by the designer, where you start with 2 fewer life levels than at level 4. I played 30 games before reaching the point where I needed that challenge. I don't see any end to the replay value, because it will always be possible to remove another life or two as necessary. So far I've won with every number of starting life going down to 13, but hit the wall at 12.

I am normally into more complex games, and more thematic games, but this one drew me in. I'm glad it did, and recommend that others give it a try as well.

Update: I've reached 100 plays. Considering how many games I own, and how many options that gives me, I think 100 plays speaks for itself. This game is special, no mistake.

I have about a dozen plays in.  Name of the game doesn't fit and the reference to "life" tokens seems off as well.  The game plays well and has some replayability.  Its a 7 for now.

RATING: 9
An amazingly big game in a small box. Friday strikes exactly the right balance between luck and strategy, and you really do feel like you are influencing the growth of Robinson Crusoe (you play the titular character, and you spend the game teaching RC how to fight). Very cleverly designed. I know the art has some detractors, but I quite like it; it's silly, fun, and it fits the theme. I'll be playing this one a lot.

Superb, elegant, and surprisingly thematic solo deckbuilding game with marvellous artwork.

Each turn you draw hazard cards, which require a certain amount of time/effort to get past, represented by a number of cards to draw from your Robinson deck. If you defeat the hazard (drawing cards equal to its difficulty), you learn some new survival skill, rotate the hazard 180 degrees and add it to your Robinson cards. If not, you suffer a little but can unlearn your weak habits and thin your deck of useless cards. Each time through the Robinson deck makes you age a little more (painful aging cards); each time through the hazards ups the difficulty, until finally you face the pirate attack. Just try not to die.

Luck of the draw plays a factor, but so does skill and strategy. Of course nothing compares to a real opponent, but Friday wrings more fun out of random card draws than I would have thought possible. It's an addictive little gem that, like A Few Acres of Snow, puts all of those tedious Dominion derivatives to shame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great solo-game, its hard to win level is surpassed by its fun factor. Each game the player has to adequately address the scarce resources he/she has and try to adequately manage the hazards the game presents in each turn. Lots of re-playability and continuos strategies and tacticts makes this game a must-have.

RATING: 7
[RGG 11 edition] {Adventure; deck-building} Friday is a fun little game.  This is surprisingly challenge for me.  As a solo game, I think this is more fun than Mage Knight and Le Havre (at least with much simpler set up).

The strategy is easy, as all other deck-building games.  You have to get useful cards, and destroyed bad cards.

Most of the tension comes from the ageing cards, which would cause you trouble at the wrong time.  The hazard cards, on the other hand, are not as sexy / dangerous, esp. if one can collect most useful cards at first two phases.  The final showdown with pirates directs the card collection strategy.

The card illustration and the tokens are fun and cute.

Replayabiltiy is average.  Not a keeper in the long run.

I really like this game. Its the only solo game I have played so it is hard for me to judge it compared to other solo experiences. It plays quick and has a good balance of luck, strategy, and tactics. It keeps me coming back.

I hate to say this because I wanted to like it but I found this game boring. The artwork is meh, the theme is bland and I never really felt like I was apart of any story. I think the rule book is confusing and I had to watch a few playthroughs to really grasp it enough to play on my own. The couple of times where I made it to the pirates (end game), I was unsure if I misplayed something because of the many extra "special ability" moves within a turn that can be played. It turned into a giant cluster of cards in front of me, some turned this way, some turned that way, and I still had to look in the rule book to make sure the actions I took were legal. Overall, I didn't enjoy it much.

If you're stranded on a desert island, then you can use this game's bits to make fishing lures, its cardboard box to shred for tender and kindling for a fire, and its cards as survival biscuits because they've been secretly infused with calories, vitamins, and proteins in the event of disaster.  The game will keep you alive until rescue or until you're captured by pirates or eaten by cannibals.

RATING: 5
Clever but limited solitaire deck building game. The idea is to successfully negate a number of hazards (depicted by cards) with your existing deck of cards. Once beaten the hazards become part of your deck thereby strengthening it. The hazard deck has to be beaten three times at which point you can attempt to win the game by defeating two pirate cards with your deck. This is a challenging game in many ways and you have to make good decisions on whether to be successful in acquiring hazard cards or not as you try to build your deck most effectively (it tends to be advisable to go for the stronger cards first as they become increasingly difficult to defeat as the game continues). A nice touch is that once you've exhausted your deck, before you reshuffle, you add an ageing card which will negatively impact your deck. The game does scale in difficulty based on your skills as a play but once you've played this a few times you're unlikely to see a lot of variety in the way the game pans out.

Nice game, has some challenge to beat on hardest level.

However, after two plays find my interest fading away already. Not much change in game-play, it remains an abstract 'grind away' type of game.

Might as well whip out my Agricola or Mage Knight and try to optimize scores. Or try a solo Pandemic with two characters.

Think I'll be holding on to this until I've beat it on hardest level after which I'll sell it off/trade it away.
Can't seem to find any reason to hang on to it after it's beat. Bane of all 'purely solitaire', I guess.

Traded it away at the Essen math trade 2013.

I'm a little undecided on this one. It doesn't *feel* like a deck-builder which is a big bonus and it makes decent thematic sense as to what you're doing.

I'm not yet convinced whether I like the balance of luck and skill, but I'm willing to experiment with the game a bit more before passing judgement.

It currently feels like a puzzle that I'm trying to solve or at least partially optimise, which I guess is what it is, but it doesn't feel quite enough like a game...

Update: I'm starting to see some decent choices to make whilst playing this game - I think the page in the rulebook which tells you a series of ways you could approach a problem is key to unlocking the depths of this game. 

Rating up from 6.7 to 7.1.

Meh. I'm not sure why the designer calls this Friday, when the story doesn't remotely reflect the Robinson Crusoe narrative. And why is the player a territorial and misplaced "Friday" facilitator instead of just Robinson Crusoe?  This gripe wouldn't really matter, but I do think this disconnect mirrors the chief problem of the game, which is that it has no depth and is wholly numerical.

Never once did I feel any sense of adventure or place in this game, where I got progressively better as I learned to better count cards and weigh the odds of garnering requisite numbers.  So basically this is like a regular playing card game (poker or blackjack or solitaire) with some special abilities, some goofy artwork, and zero world building. It's hard to imagine players even bothering the read the one word flavor text after a game or two--it's simply lifeless ornamentation.

I am a fan adventure fiction, the Robinson Crusoe novel, and solitaire adventure games (Perdition's Mouth, Mage Knight, Warhammer Quest ACG, Citadel of Blood, etc.), but by the fourth game of "Solitaire: The Numerical Card Game (with Pictures)," I realized that I would be giving this thing away. Too themeless and numerical to even be a gateway game, but perhaps thrilling for the Dominion crowd (though that at least broke ground for better games).  Time wouldn't pass faster for any castaway stuck with this.

Really enjoying this wonderful little press-yr-luck deck-builder.  The thematic setting is solid and helps build the suspense during some of the tougher decisions.  Am I ready to go after these cannibals now or should I bide my time and scout the island to build experience? Not sure if the long-term replayabiity is there, but after a dozen or so plays, I feel I'm still getting deeper into the system.  There is real strategy here.    

I may rate 'Friday' even higher in the near future...  as I'm getting the feeling that this is *the* solitaire card game that I was hoping Onirim would be. Maybe even better than 'Loyang'.

::UPDATE:: 9/26/13
I still think the game is a fine piece of gaming design. However, I've decided it takes a bit too long for what it delivers. It's also pretty cumbersome in the final few turns. The cards really start to pile up and it gets a bit frustrating counting and recounting all the card effects. Then it gets even more complicated when you start tapping the cards you've used, etc.

Still good. I just grew tired of it quickly because the the things above.

I bought this game to take with me on a trip to France in April 2012. I arrived in Nice and stayed in a great boutique hotel (Hotel Windsor - highly recommended) in which every room was decorated by a different artist. My room was decorated by Claude Viallat. A week later I visited the Museum of Modern Art in Nice and the major exhibition was by the same artist on the theme of Robinson Crusoe - quelle coïncidence! Not sure what this has to do with the game though. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays: I'm finding the game pretty hard, winning once in 10 games on the easiest level. Stays at 7.

Very nice solo deckbuilder with some interesting twists. Definitely worth it if you want something that can be played solo on a small surface and is easy to carry around (even smaller if you ditch the box and the boards and only carry the cards and something to count life points). It is not dominon, but it carries quite a punch and has a really nice structure for a pure solo game.

Finding a game able to be played with a single player is difficult, but this game manages it.  Although this is a single player game, we often play it as a co-op 2-3 player experience, with everyone offering what they would perform as an action.  Fairly difficult to win, but always entertaining.

This one simmers a long time as a very difficult game. I must've played 50+ games before scoring a win! They'll be more frequent now that I have better understanding, but the difficulty optionally scales with your skill, as well! Lots of game given how small and simple the underlying mechanisms

RATING: 7
[thing=43570][/thing] is a solo game with a little of push your luck aspect, but mainly a deck building aspect. In the game you are Friday, trying to teach Robinson to survive the dangers of the island while also wanting that the castaway leaves the island as soon as possible, so you can get your life back.

The way this happens is: every turn, you reveal two hazard cards and choose one of them to face. The hazard cards has a number to be beaten depending on the phase (green, yellow or red) of the game. The cards also has a number of free cards you can reveal from your deck. The cards in your deck has numbers on them - in the beginning of the game (for level 1), they are 2, 1, 0 and -1. Most of them are 0 and -1, so even a challenge of 1 can be difficult early on - Robinson is [i]really[/i] bad at doing stuff. You can pay with life, 1 for 1, to draw more cards. If you beat the hazard, you take the hazard card into your deck, and now it will serve as knowledge (half of the card is the hazard, the other half is the knowledge part), and this cards are much more useful to Robinson than the ones he starts the game. If Robinson fails to beat the hazard, you must pay in life to reach the difficulty number (so, if the number to reach is 2, and you got -1, you must pay 3 life). But this can be a good thing, almost a necessity, since when you pay life to get rid of a hazard, you can also get rid of cards - for every 1 life you pay, you can trash one of the cards revealed to face the hazard. This is how you can get rid of that 0 and -1 cards.

Everytime your deck is depleted and you must reveal a card, you shuffle the cards adding to the deck one aging card. These aging cards are really bad - going from simple -2 to -5 numbers, but some have other effects - cancelling the card with the highest number, stoping the free cards received by the hazard card, and so on. You must pay 2 life to get rid of them (so, if you paid 3 life to avoid a hazard, you can take out a revealed aging card plus one other normal card).

After the hazard deck ends three times (one for each phase), Robinson must face the pirates, represented by two cards that he must face one after the other. If the defeats both, he can leave the island and Friday is finally free to rest. If Robinson fails or dies, technically Friday is also free to rest, but he will probably fell a little bad about the whole thing.

Anyway, [thing=43570][/thing] is a great solo game, that plays rather quick (around 30 min) and offers a lot of choices to be made in such a small frame of time. I enjoyed it completely, well, except for one part: the damn card size! The cards are longer than normal USA size, but have the same width. The artwork is good, like a Robinson Crusoe graphic novel for kids.

RATING: 6
No idea how to rate this. There isn't that much here. You can play it a lot of times until you learn the most reliable ways to beat it. Reminiscent of a puzzle in that way, and I don't like games to be puzzles.

I can't complain about what [i]is[/i] in the game, except for the rule where if you run out of cards during the boss fight you just autolose instead of being able to reshuffle discards like every other time in the game. I'm just not sure how I can be responsible for how many cards I have left when I'm often desperately drawing as many cards as possible just to try to stay alive.

I got this game wanting to see how the mechanics worked. The deck-building thing is kind of interesting in that having a card in your deck isn't necessarily good even if it doesn't, strictly speaking, do anything bad. The dual purpose hazard cards, which when defeated become abilities, could easily be rethemed as monsters and loot. A slick way to simulate an adventurer leveling up as he defeats monsters.

But, the mechanic for getting rid of unwanted cards doesn't seem to make much thematic sense. It's weird to be able to choose to throw a fight, in order to get rid of weaknesses.

...I think this is my only deckbuilding game and I'm pretty sure I will never like this mechanic. I'm OCD about shuffling thoroughly and I don't like that I can't easily visualize what I currently have.

I tried playing this when I first got it, but is there something wrong with the rules? I was unsuccessful at making it work. Will have to give it another try. Something I'm not understanding.... Hmmmm.

I finally taught myself this game correctly on a vacation in Cape Cod 2013, and have played over 45 games, yet won only once. It's really hard to win!!! I guess solitaire games are supposed to be. I really like the way kulling cards costs life and makes you age more quickly unless you thicken your deck with wins. I've gotten a lot of fun out of the many plays of this game.

RATING: 8
A very well done solo game, with a lot of depth and strategy. Huge replay value due to the different difficulty levels, and 16 different pirates of which you only fight 2 per game. Box says 25 minutes, but plays closer to 45-60 depending on how much you think about your moves. Expect to get beaten (and badly) the first few plays.

I would rate this game an 8 based on design and price/quality ratio alone. Based on the enjoyment I get out of it, however, I would rate it a 6. Therefore, my rating should be regarded as an average. It is just that I do not really enjoy solo games, and all the card drawing and shuffling make me long for an iOS version of the game. Still, the game feels very well designed and well balanced. I immediately played a second game after I failed the first.

Interesting integration of press-your-luck into deckbuilding.

[i]"Very poor. Annoying, I plan to never play this again."[/i]

Mechanically promising but not that replayable. Dominant strategy is immediately evident with any amount of deckbuilding experience.

I wonder if this could be made better by removing the "destroy" effects and rebalancing, as those cards almost completely negate the ageing mechanic beyond the first two shuffles.

Edit: Have dropped the rating a lot as I have no desire to play this again.

Simply said, one of the best solitaire game out here. The usage of card as challenge which turns into ability when cleared is brilliant; it translates the experience system from videogames into boardgames. And the most important thing: the gameplay is very clever, the learning curve is quite steep for this one so this means player’s skill really matters.

But since i step into videogames again i dont have enough time for solitaire gaming anymore, so this one is leaving my collection.

There is a pretty thin margin between "too much deadwood" and "too thin to survive the aging cards." Striking the correct balance seems to be the key to the whole game. (Well, that, and knowing which cards are useful in which circumstances, and how to prepare for the pirates you'll face, and...)

RATING: 6
It seems that there's a specific way to approach this game -- go for the higher-difficulty cards early and save the lower-difficulty cards for later times through the deck -- but I wouldn't say I've mastered the game, so it's hard to say if that's a prevailing way to play.  It's a neat take on the deck-building idea, though it doesn't feel too much like a deck-builder, either.  It has a nice tension, as well as a significant "One more time" feel to it, but I wonder if I would be interested in playing it more once I won it.  The turns seem to be very self-determining (which is a characteristic of most deck-builders), but the fun part is applying your special abilities the right way and knowing when to spend your life points to draw more cards, or lose a fight to get rid of cards you don't want any more.  It's not a bad way to pass the time, since the game takes less than a half-hour to play once you know the flow of the game.

Wow. It has been a while that a game completely blew me away like this one. All the excitement that I felt when I discovered the elegance of deckbuilders came back to me while genuinely being enthralled in the solo experience. The last couple of games I played do not even get close to this one.

Even more, at its heart this is a card counting, push-your-lack game. And I hate both these mechanics. But here the betting really adds to the thrill and the counting is doable by any first grader.

The amazing aspect of Friday is that it gets the balance of discarding and hoarding cards just right. The difficult decision is in eliminating cards despite the fact that they seem valuable. Your deck needs to have both engine-building elements (e.g. draw more cards) and powerful "hit points", and the balance needs to be adjusted to the overall game state.

Brilliant. Elegant. Addictive. Simple but deep. Evolving and full of interesting choices. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.

The only caveat I have to a full blown recommendation is that the play deck only consists of about 60 cards, so once you figure out how best to solve the puzzle the game may lose some of your interest. It's only a 15-20 dollar investment though, so by the time that happens most people will probably have already gotten their money's worth.

Finally beat it!

Level 1 = 85 points
Level 2 = 57 points

Ottimo solitario, uno dei migliori a cui abbia giocato, a volte si fa confusione con tutte le carte tirate in gioco e sopratutto con l'utilizzo delle azioni speciali, ma il gioco è veramente piacevole.

Good game! First Friedemann Friese game, and will be looking more into his games! This is a very difficult solo game! Challenging and addictive! Keep wanting to come back and play it more! If you like solo gaming and deck builders, you should definitely check this out.

RATING: 6
Very clever and addictive. Strange artwork, but no matter.

I only got about 8 plays out of it before finding solid heuristics, not the 20-30 plays I'd hoped for. Guess I'll just pass it on to a friend, so no real complaints there, but I'd hoped for more.

Let's call it an 8 while learning, and a 4 after.

Solo Deckbuilder. Sounds boring? it's not it is super addicting and really satisfying (and tough) on level 4. It gets way easier the more you play it at this point I could probably win 50% of the level 4 plays which I think is perfect.

RATING: 5
Torn between this one. On the one hand, I appreciate what the game design tries to accomplish. And also that the theme matches. On the other hand, for me it's a game of card counting which I'm not a big fan of. I'll keep the game and sporadically play it as it's very potable.

This game packs a lot of challenge into a small box. It doesn't have the greatest art, and the cards are an odd size (hard to find sleeves that fit them), but it is incredibly portable and has a lot of replay value.

Tried it for about 15 plays, then decided it's not for me. You have to work with the hand you're dealt, which - if less than optimal - makes it too hard to even get close to winning.

Solo deck building card builder. Avoid random powered pirate ships and get off the desert island. Upper and lower sided card play that is well integrated with theme. Can purposely lose events to strengthen deck but thinning the deck and cycling deck faster causes age cards. Adds a legacy component. My wife and I love playing this traveling. Leave the game boards at home. Fits on the airplane tray in front of you. Cards are showing wear.  Need to find sleeves for this card size.

Interesting solo deck-building game. There is quite a bit here in a package that still feels quite light. It's a short solo fix with some challenge (especially as you play higher levels). 
'18/01/05: After playing a few more times, I feel like this is a bit "solved" in the sense that I am able to win fairly easily on the higher levels now. I guess that is to be expected since there isn't a huge amount of depth here. Good for 10 to 20 plays, or more if you just enjoy the activity.

This tiny little box has a good game inside. It is an ideal solo game, easy to set up, not much space required, and most importantly, engaging to the end.

I won on my first play of this...but did not have the sense to record that play...because winning did not come easy, so it would have interesting.

The whole package could fit easily in a suitcase, knapsack, or even a purse.

Don't leave home without it.

Fantastic solo game.  Feels random at times, but there are some interesting decisions IMO and it can feel very tense for such a simple game.  Small box, low price, relatively small footprint.  Sleeves are a bit of a pain, though.

I half-participated in a friend's game to get a feel for the rules and the system.

I'd like to try it once myself to give it a fair shake, but I'm completely anti-solo so it won't be a purchase.

My solo time goes towards video games or rules reading, not solo board games.

I play almost no solitaire games; I'd usually rather read when it's just me.  But for some reason I find this pretty captivating.  For being just a few decks of cards, the game is very evocative of the theme.  There's certainly randomness, but you can learn and do better with repeated play.  It plays quickly, 20-30 minutes for me.  The flow of the game becomes natural very quickly.

It took me seven plays to beat the game on level one, so I'm off to level two next time.  We'll see how that goes.

This game has some tactical decisions to be made, push your luck mechanics, nice combos and, on top of all, it is incredibly challenging!

Love it.

Interesting solo game! Doesn't just feel like solitaire, there's real tactics and strategy. Kind of like a good co-op, but for one!

This is a really cool one. A singularly solo adventure? And a deck builder?? Leave it to Friedemann Friese to create one of the strangest games I've ever seen or played, but man, what an adventure! Solid mechanics and a very unique take on deck building, this one is a must have for its low price point and for its solo nature, if that's your kind of deal. I love the ideas present here, and the art is silly but enhances the narrative that's being told through the game mechanics. Do you take the hit or go for the lesser evil? What you left behind will be coming back for you later so watch out! So cool.

There are times, that one of us doesn’t want to play a game, and the other one does want to play a game. Or has other tasks to fulfill, before he/she can take part in  a game. For these occasions is Friday. Easy, fast, and playable with just one. During a turn has to to two things. 1. Draw a card and 2. Resolve the card.

In basic, that really is all there is in this game. Nothing special, just fun.

RATING: 8
First impression:  This is a very dynamic deckbuilding game, which like [thing=11][/thing] has an ever-changing deck, based on what is pulled out of play.  The deck of challenges you face is increasingly thinned as you cull the good cards for "your" deck, but the faster you cycle through that deck, the faster the difficulty rises, and the sooner you have to face pirates.  Stripping your deck down to a lean machine means you cycle through it faster, and each iteration adds a horrific Aging Card to your deck.  Fascinating stuff.

Upon further play: Choosing your combos, and gauging your odds really make this very cleverly designed game.

The mechanics of this game seem to be a bit tedious. You are more engaged in drawing, putting down and putting back cards than in deciding something.
That could maybe change if you always keep track of the remaining cards - but I didn't like to do that...

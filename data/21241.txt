The game is excellent. The classic 'knife fight in a phone booth'. I love the way the token pick up makes you think both tactically and strategically.

One of the most favorite wargame on board.

All of the Armies in starter packs is pretty balance itself. Each faction has unique advantages and abilities on its own makes the game memorizable. The game mechanics somehow a little complex but can get used to it on few mactches. The time required for a game is quite low (avg 30 mins). The mechanics of the game itself highly depends on unit placement and moderate of luck on unit/action drawing. This make each game not only has high replay value, but also create more possibility of 'playing on same faction match up. 

Strangely, this game resembles some elements of chess, which I enjoyed it.

On the other sides, each factions has limited playstyle due to specialed traits. Also, the game and its expansions do costs a fortune, espectially in Asia, so I rate this game 9/10. (However, I think this game deserve higher ranking so I rated it 10 in BGG)

I like the concept of the game and the strategy involved , the assymetrical races, the quick game play and above all a very easy and straingh forward game mechanics. However this is not a game for non gamers and additionally experienced players will crush non-experienced ones. Also the phase of resolving battles requres a lot of focus and precision where you need to look at all the very small simbols on all tiles and consider them in order to play the game without mistackes. This can be a bit of confusing.

Great 1v1 battle game.  Feels like something in between the Hive and Battlecon.  It's abstract and thematic.  There is also just enough variance in each of the different armies to make the game asymmetric and interesting.

RATING: 5
I'm not a big fan of luck-driven boardgames, but I actually really enjoy the game as an iPhone app - as such it works well as combat resolution is automatic and there's no downtime due to AP.. it's very fast and in a right kind of way, frustrating. I'd rate the [i]iPhone app[/i] around [size=12][BGCOLOR=#66FF99][COLOR=#66FF99]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]8[/b][/size][COLOR=#66FF99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - it's a highly addictive game I "love to hate". There's a lot of interesting tactical depth to this puzzle game despite the considerable luck element. 

However, as a [i]board game[/i] Neuroshima Hex is quite terrible.. Long downtime, AP, difficult calculations.. the game takes way too long for what it is. If the game would be short you wouldn't perhaps feel [i]quite[/i] as bad for being screwed by bad luck in the random tile draw, but the game always seems to take forever and people get frustrated and mad at each other. As a board game I'd rate it [size=12][BGCOLOR=#CC99FF][COLOR=#CC99FF]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]5[/b][/size][COLOR=#CC99FF]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size].

One more thing that has to be said is that you really need to play the game dozens of times before you get a hang of it. Basically you have to familiarize yourself with every single tile in the game and memorize the content of every faction deck to be able to appreciate the tactical (can't really say "strategic" as the game is too random for that) side of it. Between highly experienced players the game is probably very interesting, but new players: expect your first 20 or so games to be chaotic and disappointing.

An abstract which is VERY well-disguised as a futuristic battle game. It's not bad, as I tend to shy away from abstracts as I get older (oddly enough).

I was looking for an elegant tactical factions game - it was this or Summoner Wars. They were both cheap, so I bought both. Both got some play time in the first few months, both were enjoyed and quite a bit. However, a year and a half later, SW is still a game that I am excited to play, while NH sits on the shelf. Still a good game, but not as portable and, for me, less balanced and more abstract than SW. 

...and yet it has certainly stood the test of time in my collection. Rating going up from 8 to 9.

RATING: 8.5
Neuroshima Hex has this cool post-apocalyptic theme.  But it's the gameplay that's really engaging.  It's cool to look and see who will kill who when the time comes to fight, because that will often change over the course of the interim turns as some units move away, others come in to block ranged attacks, and still others come in that will kill the attacking unit before it gets a chance to attack!

The booster tiles and bases have interesting, thematic effects as well and definitely lend themselves to different types of play.  The different factions play differently against each other, and since your options are limited by the tiles you draw (and you can only use about 2/3 of your deck since you discard the other third) the games are very tactical and don't seem samey.

A very good game.

It is a bit random but not too much. It is fast so can be used as a filler but is interesting enough to play only this game for entire evening. It requires little space and could easily have a travel version (but it does not).

The rules are simple and easy to grasp.

RATING: 6
A pretty abstract war-ry themed game where your armies slug it out on a phone booth sized board.  The strategy appears to be hit your opponent's HQ as early and as hard as possible, and preserve the units in contact with the HQ so that the HQ is pinned, can't provide its bonuses to enemy units.  What happens away from the HQ doesn't seem to matter too much.

This is a really fun game so far.  I think it works best as a two-player game, as every three-player game I've tried has had a kingmaker problem.  It is awesome head-to-head, though.  I want to play this one some more!

More time has passed, and this still holds up great as a two-player game.  I really enjoy it.

Maybe I missed something.  I marvel at the comments this receives from my Geekbuddies.  It's not bad, but it's not all that and a bag of chips.

The name is Ameritrash, but the gameplay is Euro/abstract (think: [thing=9674][/thing]).  The only random part is the piece draw, which is pretty much what a worker-placement game has and this reminds me of.  You place them, you calculate your success.  Even the end game screams "Euro" (something similar to [thing=9209][/thing]), rewarding the guy who jumps out to an early lead and then churns through his pieces.  If your combat markers show up at the end, it's really hard to score hits, ya know, and if your final draw is 2 combat pieces -- well, what good is that?

I played 2 games, using the 4 factions in the box, and it seems to depend a lot on bad draws.  For instance, in one game, I drew 3 of my 4 combat markers in the first 10 pieces.  I had 2 out of my first 11 pieces that were actual combat units.  In another game, after a big combat, my opponent drew a lot of combat units and I could not.  It's not management as much as dumb luck.  I could calculate combat results and end game winners long before they happened -- again, that "Euro feel".

Maybe I need to play it more often: I'm open to it.  Maybe it needs a house rule, such as a limit of 4-5 tiles, instead of 3, and a requirement that you play no more than 2 and discard at least 1.  Or dividing the stacks up in units and tactics and having you select where you draw from.  But doing that just makes it more Euro, but in it's current state, it just seems like the game is misfiring on a cylinder.

Neuroshima Hex! is a strategy game set in the post-apocalyptic world of Neuroshima, a Polish role-playing game. Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch, and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles: soldiers, support tiles, and special actions. You win when all enemy headquarters are destroyed or when your headquarters is the least damaged at the end of the game.

This was described to me as "A knife fight in a phonebooth."  Entirely accurate.  The gameplay is strategic and entertaining, with interesting choices and options.  However, it's also somewhat luck-based.  If you turn over great pieces, you'll likely do well.  While the other half is strategy, since the fighting is within the confines of a phonebooth-sized piece of real estate, it's quick and dirty.  Strategy plays a part, but it's not strong enough to fully capture my interest.

A good, fun game, but not quite right for me.

Great fun.  Knife fight in phone booth my aunt Nelly; this is much more like competitively building two Heath-Robinson (~ Rube Goldberg) machines that snake around each other  and try to take each other apart every now and then.  The only side I'm not really a fan of is the neojungle (an expansion team); it's probably balanced on average, but it seems to produce not very enjoyable lopsided games.

RATING: 10
Why I think you should play this:

*Like Claustrophobia, the European influence to the theme makes it compelling for me. Somewhere between Terminator and Mad Max the factions find character. 

*The small board and colourful hexes keep the theme and present a unique aesthetic. I also enjoy the terrain add-ons in the first expansion and the Duel board for two-player games. 

*The asymmetry extends beyond simply the theming to very different styles of play for all of the armies (including some excellent fan expansions). Although the contrasts can produce disadvantage, it never leaves one army at an impossible vulnerability to a specific other.  

*For me, this game condenses what I liked about miniature wargaming (asymmetry, positioning, basic strategies, complex tactics) and eliminates what I didn't (expensive miniatures, unclear rules, customisation). That is plays in < 30 mins. is a big plus.

[With Babel-13 and Duel]

Quick, fun, I am not very good at it.

Takes tile-laying (sort of), wargame mechanics (lines of fire, position, damage, initiative, sort of), card drawing and hand management (sort of) and Blue Moon-ish "decks" with special powers and personalities, and produces a unique, fast, deep (I think, so far) game.

This is a tactical strategy game that appears to be lighter than I hoped for.  On the upside its accessible to a broader audience. My eight year old daughter gets it and enjoys it. However the differences between the units and 4 main teams should give the game good replay value.  I have enjoyed the couple games I have played so far and can see playing this a lot.

A post-apocalyptic conflict game with some of the feel of an abstract; sacrifices, pinning and Kings (HQ) to be protected at all costs.  As this suggests, Neuroshima Hex isn't just a jolly shoot-em-up, but offers plenty of challenges to make the best use of your units.  

The four armies provided in the box are nicely varied, while the expansion Doomsday Machine are quirky fun.  Plays in 30 minutes with two.  My one four-player game ran much longer, but was still enjoyable, and it was nice to play on the full board.  

The rules seem complete, but are not the easiest to reference.  Production of the board and pieces is pretty good and the artwork is evocative.  I'd highly recommend downloading the army reference cards from BGG.

En este juego no existen las "interrupciones". Durante tu turno los otros jugadores no pueden modificar tus acciones con eventos y cartas especiales que te obliguen a cambiar de idea sobre lo que tienes que hacer.

El juego permite entre 1 y 6 jugadores (En la caja vienen 4 facciones básicas y una facción avanzada que, se supone, es algo más complicada de jugar). La modalidad de 1 jugador consiste en una baraja de cartas de desafío. Cada carta te asigna un objetivo que debes cumplir, te especifica la disposición inicial del tablero, las losetas que se pueden utilizar y el tiempo o movimientos requeridos para completarlo. La solución a cada desafío viene detrás de cada carta.

One you get past the rules, it has great combat mechanisms that DON'T have DICE (major plus for me).  The one negative is that it is possible to go ages without getting an attack card, but I suppose there has to be some level of randomness in a combat game.

A good two player game, and a standout because it offers something fairly unique.  

I like that all of the randomness comes up front in the tile draw, but from there you can manage it and reasonably calculate the outcome of your placement.  It's also pretty tactical vs. strategic, which things moving along quickly.

Tried this as a 4 player free for all, which was too chaotic and had too much downtime.  I think it might work much better with teams though.

RATING: 9.5
This is the only game I have on my phone and I have played it heaps - probably too much. So many tactical decisions and so much variety with the different tile draws and armies. This game is unlike any other: so well designed and so much fun to play. I haven't played it as often on the actual board game but always enjoy it when I do.

After only one play, I have to say I really like this.  There are a lot of possibilites for expansion, and there seems to be a lot of good (fairly simple) tactical decisions to make.  Played quickly and seemed like it would be easy to teach too.

RATING: 7
Lovely tactics game with well balanced forces and a unique way of starting battles.  Each phase is like a little puzzle with not only the need to balance force but also initiative which makes the game a bit of a brain burner, but with enough luck to keep new players competitive.  Need to play more...

RATING: 6.5
For fans of abstract games and wargames, this is a nice mix.  Game play consists of playing unit tiles down in a hex grid.  Location and orientation matter, so players need to be thinking several turns ahead to what may come out next (for all players).  The game comes with 4 unique armies that can be played off each other.  The mix of these armies and the randomness of the tile draws ensures that the gameplay is different in each playing.  Normally, this variability is a strength in game, but with this one, the differences in armies results in a rather unusual set of learning curves (1 curve for each combination of armies),  Until all the armies are known and how they fare and match up against each other, the game can leave players feeling more played than player.  That said, if enough effort is made to understand the unique advantages and weaknesses of the forces then the game provides quite a bit of strategic options - all in a tight and quick playing package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An abstract with a wicked-cool theme. This is NOT a tabletop miniatures-ish game. It's also not a Carcassonne-ish tile-laying game. It's just...Neuroshima Hex. I like how each army has its own feel, and the random tile drawing might irritate some people, but I think it forces you to be more tactical.

I love the game, but find some of the app battles really damn hard, and haven't had anyone locally to play the board game version. Post-apocalyptic theme, based on a Polish RPG I have yet to try. They transformed it into a hex-based tile warfare game with a lot of strategy to it, but at its core, the mechanics are quite elegant and make a lot of sense. This new edition looks great and comes with 5 armies to start with, and there are more you can add on.

Szokni kellett kicsit a látványvilágát. Talán jobb lenne, ha kevesebb szerepe lenne a szerencsének, pl. ha nem csak 3, hanem 5 lapkát fordíthatnánk fel. De egyébként nem bántam meg, hogy kipróbáltam. Azért nem veszem meg, mert nem igazán tudnám kivel játszani, túl speciális ez az absztrakt wargame... A hivatalos játékidő meg egy vicc. Mi legalább 2 óráig ütöttük egymást. Rosszul csináltunk valamit? 4-ből 3 bázis megmaradt a végéig...
---
Volt már fél órás partink is, szóval mégsem elírás a játékidő. Nem tudom, mit csináltunk azon a 2 órás partin:)
---
Rájöttem, hogy ezzel a játékkal az a bajom, hogy hiába ülne le közénk a világ legjobb Neuroshimása, ha látnánk, hogy jól áll, elkezdenénk ütni mindannyian, és lehet, hogy utolsó lenne, holott végig tökéletesen játszott. Vagy lehet, hogy a világ legjobb Neuroshimása kivárna, hagyná magát ütni az elején, és csak a végén vezetne, épp ettől ő a legjobb?:) Egy biztos, teljesen hektikusnak, majdhogynem randomnak tűnik a partik végeredménye... Ettől nem is érzem komolynak, pedig amúgy annak tűnik. Kár érte:(

First session.  The game is a very good 2 player game.  The team version works very well as well.  I like that each faction has a different feel to it and they are very balanced.  I have played as per rules of drawing 3 tiles and discard 1 every turn and I have also played with every tile is accessible from the get go.  Both rulesets played very well with the all accessible being more stressful than the former because if you lose it is all your fault :p.  You cannot blame lady luck for your loss. :) The game is quick unless you have an AP player which makes the game really drag.  I suggest getting a chess clock since the game plays like chess in a way that every move has repercussions.

A "miniatures" close combat game that is not bad at all. Your tiles (units) have various abilities that affect the (very small) field of battle, which is constantly changing. That's one of the things I didn't like, I'd like a larger grid with some permanent elements on it. The tiles that provide abilities to adjacent units could be made to withstand more hits and the board could be larger. Having said that, if you don't mind that the game is on the verge of being characterized as abstract, you'll enjoy it.

Solid light tactical combat game, not sure if it could be classified as a wargame. I enjoy it better than Nexus Ops because it is a more elegant design. No cards to worry about, no dice to roll. Overall there is less luck and more room for strategy. I think this is even better than Titan.

Je trekt random 3 van je fiches, waarvan je er 2 op het bord legt.  De anderen doen dat ook.  Maar tegen dat het weer aan jou is, kan je veel zijn kwijtgespeeld of juist niet.  Lastig om alle effecten in te schatten.

Ook lastig om alle symbooltjes te onthouden; ze zijn echt niet straightforward.

By far the most used game in my collection. Amazing tiles. Each faction is like a brand new game as each faction brings it's own abilities and uniqueness which will challenge even the seasoned of players. Tons of army expansions will keep you busy for years.

Analysis Paralysis can be tough. In some cases it's been down right ridiculous with this game. While they share many similarities all armies are specialized so it takes time to adjust to new abilities that may touch the board. Also, you can just throw out that 30min play time written on the box. I've played this game probably 3 dozen times or more from 2 player to 5 and I've only been able to wrap it up in 30mins just once. Normally, look for 1-2hrs(or more) depending on player count and familiarity with the game. 

The game is more than worth the buy. It REALLY shines once you start getting the expansion army factions.  The only down side with the game is the expansions come with papered instructions which can get funky looking after repeated folding and unfolding. My suggestion is to cut expansion instructions to size of base game box and laminate them for forever use.

Chaotic skirmish game that feels like an interesting mash up of something like chess and a miniatures game. The movement is largely tactical, but each army's strengths and weaknesses inform how you plan our your tile placement. Feels kind of random the first battle, but the learning curve isn't too steep. You can pick up the basics in a single play. Fun, quick, intense skirmish game with some truly unique ideas.

Best played as 2-player. (I really, only play it that way, and rate the game played that way.) Really interesting play, and dynamic tactical situations. The now 9 armies feel different, all have different twists, with not too many new abilities thrown in. Make sure to play with The Duel rules/board, as this gives more choices of what to do with a not-so-great draw of tiles. Plus, its a battle that lasts 30-45 mins.  Great!

Bought from Games Chain in Chatswood; missing one commando token from Outpost (token was replaced quickly and easily, thanks to Z-Man).

Owned iPhone version before I bought physical copy - iPhone version sold me on this game, now I'm hooked - great abstract strategy game. Theme didn't really grab me, but the game underneath it is great. Ignore anyone who bitches about luck - the game is about fast gameplay and making the most of what you have. Sure, sometimes you'll lose becuase of a bad turn, but it's pretty rare, and most of the time you'll be at fault, not the draw deck. Ultimately the length of time between battles ameliorates any bad luck turn-to-turn - you always have two or three draws between battles and the game is about initiative, not draws.

I love how well-balanced all the armies are - I have won and lost with all of them in all sorts of matchups. Great game, can't see myself ever getting bored of it. Can't wait to get expacks with new "armies".

Neuroshima Hex is an abstract tactical combat game (think chess) set in a post apocalypse wasteland spread out on a Hex Grid 5 spaces across (7 spaces for a 5 or 6 player game).  Players take turns placing their Base on the Grid and throughout the game they take turns placing troops, support units or triggering actions until the grid is full.  Then in descending order of initiative the units will take shots at each other or fight in hand to hand combat.  Slowly they eliminate each other until the grid is mostly empty and start all often again.  The last player standing, or the player whose base has the most of their 20 life points remaining, is declared the winner.

What makes Neuroshima Hex so interesting is the Armies.  Each comes with 35 tiles and is unique in their composition and combination of units, including a unique player power.  The uniqueness of each army contributes greatly to their overall strategy and players really get a feel for the style they are geared for once the units come out.  One army may be a marauding band of hand-to-hand brutes while the other may be a mobile strike force of specialists.  These strategies really start change up once you increase the player count from your initial two.  The opponents will get more opportunities to exploit your armies weakness while in the cramped quarters you will get more opportunities to maximise your unique capabilities.  

Neuroshima Hex changes from a strategic came to a tactical masterpiece once you set up however.  After placing your base you will shuffle the remaining tiles face down and you're at the mercy of the draw.  Even worse, out of the three titles you draw each turn you must throw away one before you place the other two.  This really leads players to decide best possible action, sometimes when none is optimal.

Despite the agony of choice and the seeming cruelty  of the draw, Neuroshima Hex never feels luck driven and is incredibly well balanced.  Once you go down the rabbit hole of expansion armies, you'll find endless replayability and tactical joy.

Only played once but finished in 1/2 hr while learning the rules also. Picked up the icons pretty easily and some of the strategy as this game could really have some depth if you wanted to play that way. Friend compared it to Hive which I agree with his analogy. Limited number of choices with each piece having a very specific action that it can do. I guess this would be Hive on crack. For a light yet deep 1/2 hr. game with lots of good, tense choices to make we'll be using this as our starter/ender/filler for quite a while. Great game!

The small board crams units in close up, with tension mounting and a chain of events building and building, just waiting for something to happen. Then someone plays an "attack" hex and it all kicks off, clearing the board for more unit placement!

The different armies have different focuses, such as close up brawlers, long range shooters, which determine overall strategy. 

I've played this quite a lot now and still think it;s great. I actually owned the expansioon before I owned a copy of the base game, which has to be slightly unusual!

It's awfully clever and doesn't become boring after many, many games. 
It still has its flaws with its randomness sometimes,  but that also means fun. I hope this game develops in many different ways with its extension cause it certainly can do that and even more!

While I Like the concept of this game (unique factions, tactical combat), they manner in which it is implemented it just a total turn-off for me. There just isn't enough  control over your army to give the players any sort of feeling of accomplishment. Even worse, a bad draw could leave you totally hosed (as was I in the first game I played). A gamer buddy of mine likes this but I just don't get it. It was boring and tedious.

Pretty decent little game. While it is a very high strategy game, the order in which tiles are drawn can really leave you miserable some turns. While there is some diversity to each color and their "deck" they don't really stand out from one another enough for me. The map is VERY small which causes a lot of conflict to ensue but often leaves you unable to setup any meaningful attack combos. This game is a great little filler as it doesn't take a lot of time and it's easy to pick up and play. While it's not my favorite game ever, it's still a good game and worth playing for sure!

In storage?

Rating based on one play of base game only.  Very cool combat game that feels more abstract than anything else.  Plays quickly, has lots of cool choices.  Only complaint is that it got a bit bogged down in the middle because one of my opponents had a lot of net guys, so there was an entire portion of the very small map that was static for the last 2/3 of the game (since his net guys were shielded off by HQs, other net guys, and guys of mine who could not move).  Very much looking foward to expansions for this!

Aggressive tile-laying game with asymmetric sides. 2-player games is probably the sweet spot, as it avoids the problem of kingmaking in conflict games. The main problem here, though, is luck of the draw, which can be significat. For that reason, the game should be played at a good pace.

This is definitely simpler than Vortex/Maelstrom, but I don't think it's really any better.  It's almost pre-programming and doesn't fit the theme particularly well, though I concede each faction does play differently.  Perhaps I'd like it better strictly two-player, but my one play at ConnCon this year made me realize I am better served by keeping Vortex and not chasing this game.

I can't wait for this one to arrive!  Ignacy and the team at Portal are a great bunch of guys.  This game looks great!

It has arrived - can't wait to play!

Update:

Game has arrived - I have played two games and tentively rate this game an 8.5 -  My rating will probably go a little higher as I become familiar with the special abilities and symbols.  I have really enjoyed the tense action of this clever tile placement game.  There is a definite 'building' feel to the tension - and then a massive explosion when someone plays a 'Battle' action tile.  I love the interactions, the tension and the aggressive nature of this game.  Brilliant and fun!!

Update:  Bumped up the rating.  This is an awesome game.  Very fun, tense and intelligent.  This is one of the best I own by far and away.  If you like fast playing and yet highly involving and intelligent games - this is one of the very best.

Much more interesting than I thought it was going to be. What I thought was a tactical war game is actually an abstract game with a war theme. The choices you get are very interesting, and I like that the factions are all unique. Choosing when to do battle or when to place a tile can be very tricky. I play this all the time on iOS, and I just wish they would introduce some more expansions for that platform. A nice game, though!

RATING: 8
I enjoyed this.. but something feels missing.  I believe it's a little too reliant on luck, and the armies don't seem exactly balanced.  If there was a way to seed my hand, a la Samurai.. I think I'd enjoy this one more.  Shoddy components/cutting bring this down slightly.. hopefully the reprint will be much better.

Update:  I got the reprint.. the box is huge for what you get, I'm guessing it's to hold future expansions.  The quality is much nicer, though I do miss the spinners for keeping life.  There is one team that seems extremely hard to play, I'm hoping that will balance out in a 4p game.. though I'm guessing it won't.  Overall though, this is a great, tactical game.

I find this to be clever fun. It's short, constrained, and fast-moving, which I like. The armies have good variety. Different matchups play very differently. If you avoid the free-for-all games like the plague (if you must play multi-player, play 2-on-2 teams), there is fun to be had here.

My only real reservation about it is that it can be a bit of an analysis trap. Because of the randomness of the tile draws, I'm not sure a huge amount of analysis is rewarded, but some definitely is, and with combat being deterministic and all it's a bit prone to absorbing more energy than the game is really worth. Like Carcasonne, I think it's lighter than it actually looks or plays.

But, if you can avoid that and keep the game time down to 20-30 minutes, and keep the pace going, this is good fun I think. Not a top-tier type, but fills a niche.

Updated 5/29/10.

I've exclusively played this game 2-player, in the event that provides some explanation for the low rating, but this one just doesn't really work for me.  For a game about futuristic cyber-wars, the gameplay is too analytical, and the resolution of battles is too mechanical.  It literally put my opponent to sleep on the last play.  

The whole thing feels much more like a puzzle than like a game with any sort of flow.  I never had the sense of accomplishment or progression, in large part because the game lacks the capacity for long-term planning or for any sort of dedicated path-dependent strategies.  The random tile draw feels extremely limiting, perhaps because the tiles have such wildly different effects.  By contrast, the two games that I would most compare Neuroshima Hex to are Attika and Samurai.  I rate both those games significantly higher because the disparities between the benefits of each randomly-drawn tile are minimized, the decision of when or where to play randomly drawn tiles seems to have greater strategic significance, and the game (usually) requires progressing through all the tiles, so that lucky draws are counterbalanced.  

In short, Neuroshima Hex isn't a terrible game (I didn't want to gouge my eyes out), but its a game with dreary gameplay that stands in stark contrast to its dynamic theme, with mechanics that feel artificially constraining and uninspiring, and with considerably better competition in the genre.  Decidedly mediocre.

Really enjoyable abstract tile-laying battle game.  It integrates the theme very well for this type of game and is gorgeous on the table.  The strategy is deep and varied, offering tons of replay.  Each faction plays very differently and the asymmetrical gameplay is phenomenal.  It also plays fast (45 minutes) so it will hit the table often.

I suck at this game. Oh well, hopefully that will go up with more plays. Anyway, these might sound like weird connections but I think fans of Mr. Jack and Ingenious will dig this... it's all about how to place your tiles to get the biggest payoff for the next battle. Luck factor is apparent (tile drawings) but the game is so quick it's not a huge deal. Also will appeal to those who enjoy risk management, especially when you KNOW your dudes are going to get hit and you're scrambling to take the least damage.

I'd like to play this more to get a better feel for it, but there's nothing here that's really calling me back to it....

I hav now played 2 more games with Laurène and 17 games online, this game is just GREAT!!

I've actually highered my rating from 8 to 9.

*Now she doesn't seem to have that problem anymore

[u]February 09:[/u] Ok, Lowered back my rating to 8. I still enjoy the game a lot, just don't think it deserves a 9 anymore...

[u]May 09:[/u] To expand my comentary. This is a very good tactical game. However, I regret it has no long term strategy aspect at all.This is pure tactics. Since I'm not a big fan of tactics, I won't rate it higher than 8. As long as I'm concerned, a rating of 8 for a pure tactical game is more than excellent. I love how different the armies feel and how they are balanced (though I may not have played enough with 13 plays to know for sure, at least I can tell one is not blatantly stringer/weaker than the others).

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 7

RATING: 5
Rated "8" after one play, and this will end up anywhere from a 6 to a 10. I won't know until I become more familiar with the strategy. The symbology is not as tough as, say, Race for the Galaxy, but there's a minor learning curve with the powers and abilities of each piece.

Also, strategy is not immediately apparent. I don't think I'll have a firm grasp on how to strategically play until after 5+ games. However, this appears to be a surprisingly deep, strategic game. I'm intrigued, and I want to learn more. I'm especially curious to try team play with four players.

Update: played this again recently, and looking at my original comments, I don't  think I can say it's as deep as I first suspected, but that doesn't mean I like it less. There's plenty to study, but there's luck of the draw. If it lasted 2 hours that would be frustrating. But for 20 to 30 minutes, I view it more as a fun and aggressive "super filler."

Update: played this the first time as a four-player team game. It was not as cluttered and confusing as I thought it might be. I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, it is definitely unique. But there's a few strikes against it: the symbology is tough to pick up, so the game demands a number of plays. It's probably best as a two player game, and the luck of the draw can be pretty brutal... bad enough that you're left with no real decision on your turn. I can't figure out if this is trade bait or not.

Update: well, the answer ended up as "trade bait." I traded this in a math trade for Samurai. I can see where others will grow to really like this game. But for me, the fact that it is really best with two, with a steep learning curve of iconography, and a noticeable randomness of the draw... I just got other games I'd rather be playing.

Juego muy curioso. A su favor la calidad de sus componentes y el diseño de los mismos. La temática no es apta para todo el mundo ni para todos los generos. Es un juego abstracto camuflado en un juego de guerra pero que te introduce bien el tema. Es muy interesante que venga con cuatro ejercitos y cada ejercito se juegue de una manera. A mi me queda la sensación de jugar a un Carcassonne con bazocas en vez de granjeros. En cuanto a las partidas son rápidas y tienen su miga, para aprovecharlo de verdad y sacarle el jugo creo que hay que jugarlo mucho y con la cantidad de juegos que hay ahora mismo eso es difícil de hacer. Una buena opción para los amantes de abstractos o los wargames ligeros. Con la persona adecuada puede llegar a enganchar. Si te lo vas a comprar te doy un consejo, pasa de las expansiones para picarte los cuatro ejércitos ya tienes que jugarlo mucho. A cuatro me parece muy caótico. A tres no lo veo.

iPad version. Only played vs. AI so far. Great simple tactical game, thinking about picking up board version to play with my gamer buddies.

I think this is one of the few games where the ipad version is way better than the board version however, due to all the weird modifications that affect what order pieces get to act in battles. 

This is probably a 7 or 8 on ipad and 6 on the table.

1 play (2x2 teams) - I like its mix of 1970s-80s game style hit points fighting and 90s-00 style euro multi-function hex play.  There's a lot to like, but I also think there is a clunkiness in the mechanic, maybe too many small rules, multipliers and special cases which end up making me feel a little more distant from the game.

It was interesting how the battles were planned for but it seemed that so much depended on the luck of the draw.  There were rounds of combat where I couldn't do anything at all.  It was an interesting theme and neat army concept but the lack of strategy caused by the cards really brings it down for its length.

RATING: 7
A neat little game with quick play and a good level of in-your-face-ed-ness.  The only things that disappointed me were a bit of fiddliness about some of the rules and misunderstandings about the icons, which should go away after a few plays, and the player elimination which is something that can be bad, though the speed of play lessened the effect of that.  I can see this getting better with more plays with experienced people as well.

RATING: 2
This game is essentially a "snowball fight with modifiers" with the potential for more than two players to participate. The result is a game that is essentially going to produce as the winner the player who got picked on the least - not necessarily the player who planned the best. If you don't mind that kind of game then go for it and play this game. I personally don't find that kind of dynamic in a game very rewarding and I most likely won't be playing this again as I find no intrinsic satisfaction in a victory earned simply because I was ignored enough by the other players. 

Even if I were to play a two player game where problems with triangulation are not an issue, the luck of the draw is strong enough in the game's design to cause me to want to rely on a thematic experience for satisfaction instead of on the game's mechanical aspects. However, this game is more of a collection of abstract mechanics rather than a thematic set of mechanics designed around telling an interesting story. The result is that I probably won't play this ever again unless it's a two player game and, even then, I'm not inclined to play it.

Its a colorful game, with an interesting theme...but it comes off feeling very much like an abstract game. That's not a knock, but is a bit of a mismatch with the thematic battle game the box makes you expect.

I've only played twice, but I would tweak the rules SLIGHTLY in a way that I think improves the game. I would distinguish the tactics and units on the back of the tiles. You'd essentially be deciding which of two piles to draw from for any given tile draw.

In each game, we had situations where a player drew all tactics and could literally do nothing but discard on his turn. With the way the endgame tempo occurs, its a pretty large disadvantage not to be able to do anything on a turn. 

The different armies are interesting. I've no idea if they're balanced. The game plays quickly enough, and works well for what it is. Its reminiscent of Vortex, although more streamlined. Some people will prefer the special abilities of the Vortex tiles more, but I like the simplicity and finite nature of NH better.

I've been on the fence about this game for ages but I finally got to play and it was excellent. This is truly a great tactical battle game. Deep but fast with some great concepts.

If you like a quick tactics based game, this game is awesome. I love the speed of it, the intensity of the battles, and the unpredictability of what is going to happen during each battle sequence. This is a game that can reward a person with brilliant tactical play one round, and completely mess up their best laid plans the next.

Only complaint I have: This one can be difficult to teach, they're is lots of iconography involved. And it doesn't seem to go down well with everyone (definitely not a non-gamer friendly game)

[u]Innovative[/u] "chess-like" game easy to learn but hard to master. Very high replayability and deepness, tough tactical decisions (and some strategy as well), asymmetric armies. Best with 2 players.

My edition includes 5 extra tiles: the [i]Alabama Mercenaries[/i] expansion (v2.5) and the [i]Mad Bomber[/i] mini-expansion (v2.5).

Love this tile laying war game with an SF theme.  It feels so hopeless as you battle to damage your opponent's home base more than they can damage yours.  Each set of tiles represents an army.  Each tile has various powers, some of which face only in certain directions.  Tough decisions abound as you decide which tiles to keep and which to discard out of the game, where to place a tile, and which direction to face it.  Battles can be forced by playing a tile or occur automatically if the board is full.  Tiles killed in battle are removed from the board, freeing up space to lay more tiles until the next battle.  Replayability is great as each army is different with its own powers and strategies.

-.5 for the box with the bottom half completely sealed off and hollow. Are publishers really that desperate to try to make their games stand out? It's really a shame for those of us who value shelf space more than retail presence.

I'm really enjoying this one. A few plays in and I'm not sure whether all sides are balanced, but some of the imbalances we thought we saw turned out to be completely wrong. We thought Blue was the best and Green the worst, until I just destroyed Blue with Green. It has just the right amount of theme, but really it's pretty abstract. You places units on the board, and they don't do anything until a battle happens, which is about once every few turns. The board is mostly static except for a few units which can move, and a move tile which les you move a unit. For sure there is a lot of luck, though, and probably 80% is tactics, and only 20% strategy beyond current turn. It's about being opportunistic and grabbing a few hits of the opponent's base when you can get them, even if you need to sacrifice units in the process. As someone mentioned to me when I was considering this, this works well with people who like gipf games, but want more theme, and are ok adding some luck of the draw into the mix.

RATING: 7
Clever concept but prone to analysis paralysis. After several attempts with casual gamers, I consider it as not adapted to this audience. Not due to the complexity (mechanic is quite simple) but due to the concentration/experience required to play it correctly. A seasonned player with good knowledge of the armies will be very difficult to beat.

For me, you need at least 3 players to play this one. Armies are not very well balanced, and on top of it, getting new tokens is entirely random. I like its theme though.

Amazing what a cool theme can do for what is, essentially, an abstract.

The abstract mechanics are already pretty good, mind you; however, making the leap from "make the arrows point at other arrows" to "make your mutants kill other mutants in a nuclear wasteland!" does wonders for the fun-factor.

The theme understandably put off my wife, but I enjoyed this one very much. After three plays even my wife admitted this is a very good game. It's got plenty of interesting tactical decisions and plays quickly enough to fit in games at times when longer stuff of similar weight wouldn't work. The four races seem to be extremely well balanced also and provide a lot of good variety in play.

It definitely seems better with two than three or four. Once you start adding more players, the board becomes too chaotic. I'd like to try a team game with four players, and also a four-player game using the extra ring of hexes to enlarge the playing field.

Edit: four players using the extra ring around the standard board worked pretty well. The space felt about right. Still want to try a team game.

A game of positional advantage distilled down... I can't say "to its fundamental essence", because that would be Go, but down to a fairly concentrated brew, abstracting away the majority of things you see in wargames. (This is war-themed, but not a a wargame - unless you count Go as a wargame, in which case it totally is.)

I quite like it - the spatial / timing combination of battle resolution appeals very strongly to me, and manipulating it can be a great deal of fun. I suspect that the luck of the tile draws will start to irritate me as I play more, but for now I'm enjoying it too much to care. (Besides, house-ruling for more tile control looks easy.)

Gamers I trust have told me to never, ever play this 3-player, and to play 4-player only as 2v2 teams. I can believe it.

Nice mix of four different armies (35 units each). Great replayability with the random tile draws causing a different sequence of moves every time. Can and should be played quick. Good opportunities for elegant plays, and works with kids as well as adults. The tiles could have been printed more professionally, as for some of the units the centering (front and back of tile) is off. You can always use draw bags to draw the tiles, though. And you should play this game.

At first glance this looked like a take on Nexus Ops, a great and chaotic game, but once a few games have been played it becomes clear that there is much more to it.  Given the basic board is limited to a 9 by 9 hex area things get very complex very quickly.  Its one of those games that you will want to keep going back to again and again to try different things, and to enjoy the absolute carnage when a battle is triggered.  A little gem.

RATING: 4
I've played this 2-player, 3-player, 4-player, and 4-player (teamed) with a lot of different race combos.  The verdict: this game is seriously overrated and overpriced.  3-player is awful (gang up on the loser), 2-player is somewhat okay, 4-player is a mess, and 4-player teamed is simply frustrating because of friendly fire rules.  

Incidentally, those rules make certain team combos way unbalanced, and the only way to beat them is to hope that team gets a bad tile draw. Random tile draws make the decisions, not you. 

Summary: If you're tempted to buy this because you're thinking 'How can a top 200 board game be bad?', don't.  It's bad.

iOS Version:  I'd give the iPhone version a 7 though, because of no AP and challenging AI players.  

UPDATE: Honestly, if you just accept the fact that it's pure tactics, it's not terrible considering how quickly it plays.  Still bad; just not terrible.

Multiplayer is the very definition of bringing lightsabers to a knife fight in a phone booth. Absolutely chaotic and fun, I definitely prefer scoring based on damage to other HQs rather than current HQ health when playing multiplayer. 2P is a highly strategic game, the disparity of powers and abilities that each army has balances surprisingly well. Mephisto and Dancer are a blast to play in 2P, very much unlike the other armies. Own all English printed armies, not sure if I should wait for English reprints of the remaining armies or just buy Polish versions and print out the English rules. I like having a consistent print quality with expansion army rules.

Why I still haven't reviewed this(if these can be called reviews, lol) is beyond my understanding. Waiting for better times, I guess.

It's my first serious board game(except for Hive which I bought in 2011 but played only a few times and completely forgot about it; Neuroshima arrived to me in December 2016) and the one which I've played the most times so far. This is a superb 2-player game of infinite replayability and quick play time - it takes only 30 minutes to play so you can do it at any time and any place.

Tons of expansions; every single one is worth having. The game is constantly developing and new armies are already in progress.

I've been playing the game on the iPhone for a couple weeks before playing the board game. I definitely like playing the physical board game better, but the game is great either way! The forces are all equally balanced and play in entirely different ways. Fun and tactical game, battles are great and unexpected at times. Enjoyable and excited to play more, especially since games are short! (20-30 mins). No one in my group could turn down this game!

Fast and fun light war game, great for 2 players.  There's plenty of variety in the factions, the rules are easy to pick up but there's tons of strategy and a touch of luck (random unit draws), and it takes virtually no time to set up.

At first I was a bit put off by the artwork, but it's actually pretty good. I find that we haven't been back to play this since I first bought it though...

The gameplay was rather simple to learn (basically draw three tiles, discard one and play/save the other two), but the complication comes with having to know what each unit can do, and having to know what your opponents tiles are able to do as well so you can react each turn.  I really enjoyed the first few games, and I am guessing this will be a game I will be getting expansions for sometime down the road.  The length of each game is short enough that I can get a few games played in a sitting, which is a bonus.

De 2-4 jugadors (podrien jugar 5-6, inclús a 8 si s'utilitza tot el taulell, però com més jugadors, més s'allarga la partida pq no pots fer res en el torn de l'altre, i esdevé massa caòtic).
Funciona molt bé a 2. Crec que és el número ideal.
Duració: 30 minuts
Joc de batalles, tàctic.
Assimètric: 4 exèrcits de característiques diferents --> Molt rejugable.

An excellent game, good for 2-4 players. 3 players leads to 2 on 1 teamups, but 2 player games are good for quick almost chess-like matches. The small board and limited options per turn make for a quick game, but strategy is still required, and each race plays differently (although they are not very balanced, IMO).

After one play.

This game is a real brain burner in some respects.  It definitely would take multiple plays to develop a cohesive strategy.  Throughout the game, we missed several things due to the shear amount of information (and rule exceptions) that are on the board at any one time.  I would play again, but there are large number of games that I would choose well before this one.

I love the fact that there are many different armies that have asymmetric abilities.  The game does a good job to forewarn you of the strategy you might want to employ given the skills of you units.  The components are nice, and the board allows variability in size.  Although, the different color spaces are hard to remember sometimes.  There are a few confusing mistakes in the rule book, but nothing that is not logically rectified.  

If theme is a huge deal to you, this game does not quite deliver.  The theme, while it works well, does not have any real connection to the mechanics besides a little bit of flavor.

Even after all this years, Neuroshima Hex still feels fresh. Whenever the game hits the table (or my tablet, which seems to be the more common scenario these days), I'm surprised how different it is from all other games I've played.

The available armies are all very well balanced although it might not appear so on the first few plays. While there are some rather straightforward ones, most of the more advanced armies from the expansions (like NeoJungle or Smart) need a few learning games before you get an (rough) idea on how to play with or against them. But that is part of the fun and maybe one of the few drawbacks of the game: It's best if you have at least one dedicated opponent with whom you can delve into the strategic depth of this game. Then (and only then), Neuroshima Hex is a blast!

(PS: I've only played Neuroshima Hex with two players and can't comment on any other player count.)

[2011-02-12 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]
This one is a very clever tile-laying game. Full of decisions but thanks to the random draw of tiles, it isn't overwhelming.
The armies all play very differently. Some are stronger in melee, others kill better from the distance and some specialize in disabling the opponent's units.
While building up your army on the player board, there is a lot of tension and when it comes to fighting, there will be a lot of casulties.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have yet to try four players, but based on a few two and three player games, it really feels like the only bad thing about this game is the blue army's initiative is so high in addition to their HQ pumping it, that you can't really touch their units before they get a devastating attack that leaves you at the disadvantage.

As I have played more I see how amazingly balanced the game is. I would say in general these four armies are the vanilla power armies. They are simple and each new army seems to add more interesting elements.

I have heard this described as "a knife fight in a phone booth."  While that is an apt description, it's only partially correct. 

I think the best way to imagine this game is to visualize the mousetrap experiment they use to help kids understand nuclear fission - take a room full of mousetraps, and set a ping pong ball on each one, then toss in another ball.  In just a short moment, almost all the traps have been set off, and all the balls are bouncing around everywhere.  Then, just reset and repeat the process.  That's this game in a nutshell.  Chaotic, brutal, and very very fun.

I'm going to buck the trend with this game in my rating.  I think it's below average in the amount of depth that it gives for the number of rules you have to learn.  I've played over 10 times and I still have to consult the manual almost every game to remind myself what some of the units do.

I've only played 2 player games on the iPhone app, so perhaps that explains my contrary experience.  I'm also not a fan of exceptions, and it feels like this game has a lot of exceptions (well, they are simply different types of units, but there are a lot of different types, and the symbols are not intuitive - they just have to be memorized).  The game is also a bit of a puzzle game, which is one of the types of games that I dislike.  While it's not difficult to figure the puzzle out, you have to take a little bit of time to think it through, especially to make sure you have not forgotten how oneof hte symbols works.

--- edit ---
I have now played the game as a multi-player game, and it is MUCH better.  Instead of a below average rating of a 3.75, I'd give it an above average rating of a 6.25.  So I am rating it a 5, the average of my experience with it as a two player game and my experience with it as a muti-player game.

--- edit ---
I raised my rating to a 6 (which is pretty darn good for how hard I rate games).  I still don't like this as a two player game, but there is something very fun about the multi-player version.  It's got a nice mix of strategy and luck.   

--- edit ---
Played it face to face, and I'm returning my rating to a 5.  I like the computer version better because the program figures out and resolves the puzzles (I mean battles).

This looked like it would be exactly my kind of game.  But the static sides makes it old after a game or two, and the unit's life expectancy being a turn at most keeps any game from getting emotional.

Update 6-4: Should improve as a team game, but Red inexplicably kills his own teammate.  More of a 2-1-1 then since Red can't do combos. And going 3 turns in a row without drawing a unit is a flaw in the system, not bad luck.

RATING: 9
Players play a futuristic faction, battling with their forces on a tiny hex based board.  Players take turns to draw back to a hand of three hex tiles from their pool of 35.  Tiles can be saved, discarded or played onto the tiny 19 space game board.  Tiles are split into "forces" and "actions".  Forces take their place on the board, actions do stuff with the forces.  The forces have several attributes - facing, type of attack, initiative, toughness, etc, and can also be modified by "modules" which connect to them.  When a battle triggers, it's all resolved in order of initiative - totally luck free (well, if you forget the tile draw aspect).  The winner is the player who deals the most damage to their opponents HQ.  The four factions that are included in the game are nice and different.  Bold symbols (apart from armour, which is easy to miss) make everything clear.  Great little game - only played two player so far.

I really like this one a lot.  I love how it feels like both an abstract and a combat based strategy game.  It also has a puzzle aspect, when trying to find the best placement for a piece. I also love the asymmetrical teams, different unit stats, and the brightly coloured pieces.  Unfortunately Kelsey does not love it as much as me, so I don't get a chance to play enough.  I also haven't tried it with more than 2 players yet.  This is my top request if I am gaming with another gamer who knows and likes this one.

At first, the battles can be a bit confusing to resolve (both in your head and afterwards) but that is something more time with the game will no doubt make much easier.

Another in the line of 'intriguing games that I don't play enough of.' Through my understanding of the game mechanics, I would only ever play this 2-player, due to the small map size and how very cramped it already feels playing 2-player.

I adore this idea in combat - players set up units, aiming in particular directions, with different priority and effectiveness, but not acting yet. Then, at some point, on player drops the token which instigates battle and everything breaks loose. The units are decimated and only a few tend to remain standing through the absurd crossfire. A lot of fun, I probably just need to get more games under my belt to offer a deeper opinion.

Picked up the 3.0 edition. A decent buy, but with the low prices the 2nd edition is now found at you might want to consider getting it instead. You get new art on everything. Different rather than better or worse than the old, and a new 5th faction. The Doomsday Machine are interesting and very different from the other factions i have played.

Neuroshima Hex could be accused of being made redundant by the IOS implementation as it is a simple tile placement game. But its a tense tactical 90min game that takes 2-5 players well and has plenty of colour to it. Also i don't have an Ipad.

I'm STILL really bad at this game, but I have decided to up my rating from 8 to 10: This is simply one of the most remarkable game designs I've ever encountered. I was recently talked into trying a 3-player game, and it was one of the best sessions of any game I've ever had. Outstanding.

Hex based tactical warfare.  Sounds good but I would rather play Maelstrom/Vortex.  With only 30 tiles available in the game (and only a little more than half of them are able to attack), the luck of the draw seems to have a large effect on the outcome.  Example: Let's say in my first 3 - 4 turns I draw two combat units whereas my opponent draws about 4 - 5, that puts me at a major disadvantage because my units will likely die in the first battle and it's possible that none of my opponents would if he had a chance to lay some of those five units after I placed my two.  In future rounds, I would now have all of those units to deal with and only limited/suicidal spaces to lay my own units.  This happened to me on my first game.  It was annoying to lose in this manner and even if it happened to my opponent rather than me, I would feel no accomplishment in winning.

Only played the app, and really don´t have any desire to play the physical version. This is a game that shines as a video game, since it´s fast, strategic but also heavy on luck. When an app game is between 5-15min, a bad luck draw doesn´t bother that much, but if I had to suffer through 30-45min staring at a board and calculating the battle results myself, I think I would be pretty bored and annoyed...
But all in all, a great game for your phone.
And btw, I only learned to play the game through Youtube and a how to play -video. The ingame rules were horrible imo.

Wow.  A game that has random interaction elements that remind me of Roborally, yet with a simpler mechanic.  I am not a fan of war or combat games, but this one was tremendously fun to play.

Edit: As I have now listed Heroscape as one of my "10"s I guess I am a war/combat game fan.  And I love Neuroshima Hex even more on the Ipad!

An abstract war game that i really like.  Definitely different than any other war game I've ever played.  It can be played quickly and taught fairly quickly as well.  The different factions all play very differently but I am still somewhat concerned that the red army in the base game is over powered.  Need to play some more.

Pretty cool confrontational version of the draw a tile and lay a tile mechanic. Good graphics and easy rules. I didn't like it more because of the downtime, and the sheer chaos and confusion of the changing state of the gameboard. Some will really, really like that aspect of NH.

Interested in trading my 3.0 MOLOCH tiles for the 2.0 MOLOCH tiles. POTENTIALLY interested in trading my 3.0 outpost for 2.0 outpost, too. Both trades are dependent on condition of 2.0 tiles and on whether or not the 3.0 armies are the same as the 2.0 armies. Interest: 5/5

Neuroshima Hex may be the greatest light-strategy game to ever exist.  The game is incredibly simple but don't let that fool you as tactically it has a lot of depth and strategy that; while the game has elements of luck and chance, typically Neuroshima Hex doesn't weigh too heavily upon them.  The game also has a wide array of expansion armies to expand the already very high replayability.

Games are fairly quick, and work on ramping tension, quoting Zee Garcia, "It's like a knife fight in a phone booth."

I will add a caveat, this game is really a two-player game despite what the box says.

Neuroshima Hex is solid strategy combined with instant gratification in a box (or on a mobile device).

RATING: 6.5
Not exactly my cup of tea, but it works very well for what it is. The very small battle area made positioning crucial, and since the tile draw is random, getting the wrong tiles at the start can be a big limitation. I can see why people enjoy this game though, and the potential in the system is high, so it could develop its niche in the market. The graphics are okay, the rules are well enough written, but the printing was a little poor. The graphics are offset on the tiles, so higher quality control is needed. The game system could lend itself to a boardgame version of Tower Of Defense games.

No jogo nos controlamos facções que tem caraterísticas ligeiramente diferentes.
Basicamente, em cada jogada você coloca dois de três peças (tiles) que tem variadas funções e habilidades que funcionam isolada e combinadamente. Basicamente, estas funções tentam eliminar os tiles dos outros jogadores para conseguir infligir danos nas bases de cada jogador. Fantástico!

RATING: 8
(Rating for 2 player game.) Very enjoyable tactical 2-player battle game with a quick playing time. Luck of the draw play an important role, but you still have to carefully place your fighters. It's not a brainburner, so it can act as a quick filler. Finally, the diversity of the deck means you have to adapt your strategy to the group you're playing. I didn't play enough games to comment on balance.

(As a side note, it somewhat reminds me of a side-game that was included in the PS2 title Yuyu Hakusho Dark Tournament, for which I was a programmer. Needless to say, Neuroshima Hex is light-years ahead.)

Well, for me it is still most likely one of the best games that came from Poland and it's a boardgame I am pretty much always happy to play. That explains the high rating, really - just tell me to play it, and I will!

It's thrilling, quick, full of tension and the theme is very well suited to a game of brutal fights, where tokens and tactics goes together in a surprisingly clever and deep strategy game. Sure, luck is still a factor here, and yes, some armies are a bit better or worse against certain opponents, but the game is still well balanced for such asymmetry in the factions and thanks to the rich amount of expansions, quick gameplay and adrenaline pumping action its replayability is amazing.

On the new 3.0 edition: I decided to but the old 2.5. Why? I don't like new graphic design. For me it's chaotic. Probably because I got used to the old edition. It doesn't matter - whatever you choose, you'll be happy, cause it's a great, great game!

Fantastic & fun. Close quarters battling that's sure to quicken your heart rate. The older map-board is hard on the eyes, but the latest version (3.0) improves it exponentially, for this reason the 2013 edition blows away the older one/s. The counters are well depicted and evoke theme. Game play is thankfully very quick with not too much AP. A definite keeper since it plays so quickly & is deep for it's simplicity.

Rating based on one 3 player game in which I got smoked.  There is possibility here, but no way do I care to own the edition I played, as it is of very poor quality and priced through the roof to boot.  When Z-Man  publishes it I might add it to my collection.

Update:  Due to the better quality of the Z-Man edition, I've added NH to my collection.  Although it is hard to get opponents for NH, it is somewhat compensated for by the fact that it lends itself so well to solitaire play -- playing the various armies against each other has been a hoot.

I've found the game to be too chaotic for my taste and traded it for Notre Dame.

Light wargame with abstract tile placement as its main game mechanic - players place their units (tokens) on a hex grid needing to manage combat range, strength and initiative order to take out their opposition once the combat is triggered by either player - and the timing of triggering combat is very critical - fiddly and and this is all really much better done on a computer. Components are good although some token backs were misprinted in my set enabling identification.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely enjoyed this game.  The differentiated sides really make it much more interesting.  It plays fast and loose with lots of unit losses and nice take that moments.

I would say that it is a bit too abstract for my tastes, sometimes you don't have much sense of a battle between these crazy sides.  It's still at its base a tile laying game.  Also, the version on the iPad has completely fired it.

Played a couple of times, thought it might get better with familiarity. Played it a couple more times, and can't see playing it again unless I was indulging someone.

The problem is simple: There are two types of tiles in the game (well, technically there are three, but two are grouped together in the rules...) 'board tiles' and 'action tiles'. The 'board tiles' are the ones you need, they represent 'units' and 'modules'. *Only units can attack!* So if one player is drawing 'modules' and 'action tiles' while the other is drawing 'units', guess who wins? 

Waaaaay too random for me.

Very quick, very brutal and unforgiving to mistakes - this it what makes this game shine for me.

The games concept and mechanics are very easy to understand but applying each tile to its full potential is hard to master.

Very well balanced too.

Sometimes the luck factor (drawing tiles) can ruin a game ... but the unpredictability is necessary for the tense gaming atmosphere in my opiniopn.

Sold to make room for Edition 3.0

When you think nothing else can be invented for Hex!, a new expansion comes out and brings new strategies and possibilities to the game. That goes for armies, different boards and even scenario based play. Hex! plays well with two, three and four players, I haven't played it with five or six, but I think it still gives a lot of fun :) The great, atmospheric artwork lets you dig into the theme.

Neuroshima Hex plays 2-4 players, but I've only played with 2 and it seems like it's probably best in that configuration (total guess).  The interesting thing about this game is that the battle resolution is totally deterministic. When a battle happens, you progress through numbered initiative phases. Certain characters strike or fire in specified directions on a specified phase. But it they're knocked out before that phase happens, they'll never get to attack. There are also character boosting tiles called "modules," and various fast effect tiles. What makes this tightly scheduled battle system work is the way that characters and other tiles are randomly drawn each turn. Even the timing of the battles is controlled by specific "battle" tiles that give players the option of initiating a battle when drawn.

The victory conditions themselves also add an interesting tension to the game. Each player controls a powerful headquarters unit, and the player who inflicts the most damage on the enemy headquarters wins the game. Things develop such that players often have to choose between controlling the board on one hand, and attacking the enemy headquarters on the other hand. One usually comes at the expense of the other.

Futuristic and yet slightly abstract area control game. You move your units around and try to get more of your force pointed at a unit you are attacking than they have on defense. Reminds me of Diplomacy in that mechanic.

I want to love this, and bet I would if I played it with the same opponent and the same armies a bunch of times. But for whatever reason, I'm not moved to pull it off the shelf very often.

Maybe part of the reason is that there are rarely dramatic moments. The game's structure is ingenious, but it lends itself to a slow accumulation of damage on the enemy HP and a sense that not much is happening.

RATING: 7
A solid combative abstract-ish game. Lots of replay in the box and a bunch of expansions to get into too. Game itself feels quite well tuned and tactical. 

Different starter factions are really well balanced and the 3 player is just as fun as the two for me. Mechanically the game is surprisingly intuitive and can be well understood after a couple of rounds. Trying to make efficient piece trades while setting up to hit the enemy base makes for a high-tactics feel with a bit of strategy in trying to setup certain arrangements of pieces. Pace is nice and the swings between the setup of pieces and battles means there are plenty of little victories (and defeats) that keep the game tense. 

"Drawing" tiles annoys me, so hard to shuffle them. Probably going to switch up how I manage that in the future (Bag to draw from?).

A quick and easy conflict themed game.  Lots of random draws keeps things unexpected, while the set values of pieces makes for a "luckless" combat system.

More players = More Chaos.

Played one two player game using one of the teams from the base game against one from the expansion. I had no real clue what was going on and then the game ended. I think I would need to take a look at all the different tiles of all teams first so that I know the kind of thing that can be expected to come out and what might happen. It's short though so I'd try it again without too much hesitation.

Love the simplicity of the game. Rules are explained in 3 minutes. The art is very good (whether v2.5 or v3.0), BUT, it is mostly cardboard. No minis or other bling. For %50 MRSP, I find this game too overpriced.
Whishlist: A double printed board with a map including terrain features or weather which influence combat. Minis with the information on the base "a la X-wing". A solo version which includes a campaign. The current solo puzzles are a good idea, but with the breadth of the RPG, give us a story to play through.

Very novel tile-laying game. The special powers of the tiles aren't difficult, but the interactions of modules and bases get tricky; as a result, the game feels less streamlined than it ought to. It's very much a puzzle kind of game, and I still like it despite the fact that I don't enjoy puzzles.
[EDIT] After more than a dozen plays I increasingly suspect that success is very heavily reliant on the order in which you draw your tiles. That is not good. Time might tell. The game is also very prone to fruitless AP.

Interesting, but very difficult to parse what the effects of placing will be sometimes due to the fairly complex interactions. I felt the beginnings of AP setting in sometimes, but only having a few tiles at a time to think about placing, and sooner or later everything getting shot helps keep it from becoming a problem. The information display on the tiles isn't as clear as I would like.

This feels like a cage-fight with cyborgs and guns. A very good abstract with a surprisingly strong theme, which makes me like it while usually hating abstracts. There is luck involved, but so is in war. And in this game it seems that good playing can overcome small rough patches easily.

One thing I really like in this game is how different the armies are from each other.

This is a really great little game.  Whoever described it as nexus ops advanced was right on the money.  It has a little more meat on its bones than nexus ops.  Our first game was slightly prone to analysis paralysis but I think as you learn the rules better there won't be so much agonizing as to where each tile is placed.  If this had been themed as a star trek ship battle game, it would probably be somewhere in the top 50 right now.  I like the theme it has, and the game has a number of interesting mechanics and variables.  The decision making is gut wrenching and you will be second guessing yourself a good bit.  Great little game, and the rating might rise with more plays.  VERY rich game for its short length!

I really want to get more, and not just solo, plays out of this one. Amazing mechanics, very simple and fast gameplay, lots and lots of tactical options and tons of decisions to make.

Even when I first bought the game, I underestimated it a bit. There's a lot of depth in the different armies, and fast armies (Outpost) play very different from hard-hitting slow ones (Moloch).

What's great as well is that the hexes have different meanings, are either for placing on the board or for adding effects like movement or battles - this makes every army a kind of deck that can be played more or less efficiently.

The fast play time makes it a lot less important that occasionally, battles are decided by lucky draws. All the more reason for just one more game.

Complaints that this game is abstract and puzzly are confused and misguided. There is a tremendous amount of action and excitement, twists and reversals, packed into this little game. Games are over in 30-45 minutes, but they are very intense, absorbing and layered. The build up and resolution of battles makes for a very dynamic game.  While the battle resolution is diceless, it still offers some surprises as the board changes with each step in the battle. Best of all, each army plays completely differently. This is asymmetrical gameplay at its finest, and it guarantees endless replayability. Awesome, awesome game. Babel 13 is a fantastic expansion.

The more I play this, the more I like it. Easy to teach, extremely replayable, can fit in to almost any game night schedule, and very unique.

It's certainly unique. Every friggin' piece has some special rule or gimmick but at least the iconography is pretty good and the provided piece manifests are clear. I played a 4-player free-for-all which seemed less than ideal for such an abstract game. The result was incredibly chaotic due mostly to the vagaries of the player personalities involved which ranged from purely analytical to completely arbitrary. Seems like you'd have to go with teams or just stick with 2-player on this. Also, the red army seemed severely overpowered in this particular case. Still, I'm slightly intrigued by it and would probably give it a chance to grow on me. I also happen to dig the theme and art, even though they are just thematic icing on a highly abstract cake.

Updated rating from a 5 to a 7 after playing a couple two-player games.  My first impression was pretty sour on this game, feeling it to be too random and ultimately a crapshoot on who won.  You were just reacting to the board, not doing much thinking about where to place stuff other than 'protect self, hurt others'.

I still feel it is too random.  If one player chooses a hand of all specials and no units, he is at a huge disadvantage.  The hex draws are very unforgiving and there is no way to mitigate your risk of random draws.  It also still feels reactive but the more times you play through, you can get a feel for what units will work where and what synergies you may encounter.

Overall it still doesn't wow me, but it's a fun little game that plays relatively quickly at a fairly low level of complexity.

For my first and last game ever, I played The Outpost, with 4 player cut-throat. For my first two turns I pulled three move and two battle tiles, which means I was unable to field any units for those critical turns.  For the next frustrating, boring, lopsided 90 minutes, my command center got shot up, and I was only able to field at most one or two units per turn, before they were immediately destroyed. At several points in the game, I fielded valuable tiles in unusable locations, just to cycle through the tiles faster. Yes, The Outpost seem to have neat units, but what's the point? The Borgd won by a wide margin. Never ever ask me to play this game ever again. Never. Can you tell I am livid? I am! THIS GAME SUCKS! And that's my opinion.

Oh, and then I find out a week later we were playing it all wrong... go figure... Rating: "1". Broken.

Huge box for very little components. Feels a bit overpriced.

However, game is fast and good. There's enough theme to forget that you're playing an abstract, and enough randomness and player interaction to keep you interested.

As a euro gamer who hates violence, this game is supposed to be everything I hate. The theme turns me off, the graphic design is ok at best but... Man do I enjoy this game!!! The tile placement us very tactic and is so abstracted that it becomes a battle of wits. The flow of the game is great and there not so much downtime between turns. I like it way to much for the gamer I usually am. As an ex-chess player this game excites my mind:

There was this one time I listened to J. Barzone on audio book while I was doing graphic design.  There was another time I tried to rewire a ceiling fan...what do these things have in common?  Each time I did them I felt like my brain was going to overheat and leak out my ears...And you know what, afterwords I bragged to my friends about it...Same with N.

Bought it, tried it, loved it!! Highly recommend getting this quick and thought provoking game. 

It combines strategy with combat, tension regarding what the other player(s) will do and is quick enogh that you can either sneak in one quick game, or play loads of games all night. 

The variety in the different armies give the game quiet a bit of life and replayibility.

Firstly, it's good to see some innovative game design coming out of Poland, but lets hope that they continue to develop their ideas as there are some problems here (and I don't just mean the off-centre printing in the original edition). There's some skill in where you place your units, but you're the victim of the tile draw, you may be desperate to take an action, but if you don't draw the right tile, you can't. Big battles are fiddly to resolve and there are all the usual problems of multi-player wargames: if 2 players fight another benefits, kingmaking, you name it.

This is very much like a streamlined version of Nexus Ops -- smaller board, no cards, no tower -- but with special powers for each of the units that you bring on the board.  It's very confrontational and often unpredictable.  It requires some calculation to see what all the results of any given combat will be.  Enjoyable, but it can be pretty rough. (1 play)

Having played 2.0 and purchased 3.0 sight-unseen, I have to say that I actually prefer the earlier artwork by a large margin.

Aug08: Surprisingly fun little game here!  It's got plenty of conflict, but it's pretty quick to resolve and fun to boot.  The rules flex the same muscles as Race for the Galaxy.  If you can quickly grasp the way "Consume" works in RftG, then resolving battles in Neuroshima should be easy for you.

I also like the tough decisions you are faced with every turn.  You have to through out a tile every turn, and you just never want to.  You need to go on the attack and also on the defense, and it's just tough to do both.

I don't think the included armies are all that balanced, but they sure do offer gabs of replayability.  It also seems to play better with the fewer number of people.

I also suggest waiting for the Z-Man import.  The current publication has a few usability issues that hopefully Zev will clean up.

RATING: 10
An eminently repayable light war-game, very tactical and reasonably strategic. One might consider it rather like chess, only instead of setting the pawns and pieces out in a specified fashion, players take turns drawing a few at random and placing them wherever they like. Surprisingly deep, with importance placed on orientation of the hexagonal tiles; but the random draws and multi-stage combat can make it difficult to reason about (IMO).

I own the boxed game, but I’ve played the wonderful iOS version many more times. The boxed game has the drawback of rather low build quality — the pieces are cardboard, many of them are printed off center, and it was easy to lightly damage a few of them when poking them out of the sheets they came on.

A Polish post-apocalyptic game.  As of this writing, I have played it twice.  Once a 4-player team game, the other as a 1-on-1 game with 2 players.  They play very different but are both enjoyable.  The four player was more random, while the two player was a little more strategic.  

This is a game that should be played quickly and will really suffer from analysis paralysis.  Players who feel the need to compute every possible variation for their moves will drag this game down quickly.

The first couple of times I played this game, I thought: "Why the hype?  It's so random."  But the more I played, the more I realized how the mechanisms and components work together to create something that is as much strategy as luck-based. Certainly your carefully orchestrated attack can be destroyed by your opponent drawing the right tile at the right time, but overall, knowing your army's strengths and weaknesses, knowing how often certain tiles are likely to appear (like roulette), and making intelligent decisions are just as important in factoring who wins and loses.  A champion shouldn't be decided on the basis of one game, but a best of seven would certainly indicate the better player.  The clincher I think is the length.  Playing two games in 60 minutes is not unreasonable for two people, meaning quick, tactical fun with deceivingly simple decisions required on every turn.

Great hex based army placement game. You alternate turns placing units on hexes until someone decides it's time to start a battle. The board is the perfect size that the game doesn't bog down too much when fights are triggered and each army feels very unique and it's fun to resolve a battle and see what scraps happen to be left after the massacre.

Plays quickly and the hex tiles are easy to read and the reference sheet for the army is great and gives you counts of each unit in your army which helps make decisions easier sometimes.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (March 2010)

I really REALLY like Neuroshima Hex! One of the first games I played and one of my all time favorites. I generally don’t like chaos games (I can’t plan ahead so it’s mostly luck), so I think this game is great only for 2 players (preferred option) or 4 players in teams, otherwise it leads to kingmaking and the player who stays out of the fight wins easily.

The components and the art are high quality, the time play is relatively short and each unit offers a wide spectrum of tactics. Also the theme is awesome!!! Best Polish game ever. 

Nowadays I play this a lot more on the Ipad than the physical version. The iPad makes it so easy to play as it handles the bits automatically :D.

After more than 5 years of continued play, I still enjoy Neuroshima Hex! a lot. I have bought everything I could for the physical and the online game and I always want to play it. I love that the game still gets support and new expansions every year.

Neuroshima Hex! has a feature many of my favorite games share as well (Dungeon Twister, Summoner Wars, Dominion). In each game you only play with a small subset of the possible armies (4 with the base game, much more with the expansions) adding a lot of depth and replayability with very few rules overhead.

I’m not sure I like the new 3.0 art, buts that’s maybe because I was accustomed to the old one, however on the iPad you cannot choose the old art and it is a shame. 

On the bad side, I recently bought the 3.0 Portal edition just to found out that the Doomsday Machine army wasn’t included in it, it is included only in the Z-Man edition. I felt cheated because this information isn’t widely available AND I exclusively bought that edition of the game for that army. They should make this a lot clearer. I already sold my copy of the game and I kept the 2.5 edition.

I recently played a face to face Neursohima Hex! Game and I felt it dragged a bit. I’m spoiled because I use the iPad version all the time. The only occasions I want to play face to face is when using additional rules that aren’t available in the app (energy, teams, campaign) or with armies not yet in the app.

Due to this, I’m downgrading its rating, but I still feel it is a tremendous game and I still have in in my game collection.

Played this for the first time in Aug. 2009. I've wanted to try it for a very long time, but the timing just didn't work out till now. I enjoyed it.

We played twice. So this rating and reaction isn't locked in yet.

The first game was a 4 player game and we got some big rules wrong. We worked them out as we played forward, a bit messy, but it worked. I won. The rules we learned in the play (now that we have them right) make a huge difference. 

The 2 player game that followed was with Dan. I pounded him in this go. It was a slaughter, but it was fun. I'd definetly play it again and each exposure would make you better at it.

What to think of the game? 

I enjoyed it over all. 

It had the feel of a collectible miniature's battle game (like Warcraft) without the collectability. 

There is a lot of tactical play with the tile draws, but there is also real strategy in knowing your troop count, abilities, and where you position and plan. I seemed to grok it very well and quickly.

I seemed to really enjoy it actually. I'll have to pick it up I think.

I'm concerned a bit with the tile draws being to impactful to play, but it didn't actually bother me in the playing even when I drew poorly, but it could kill you if your HQ gets pounded down before you get units on the board.

In the four player game, I could tell Kevin was going to come back as he had many units still undrawn and the end game would be close. He didn't see that at first and thought he was getting pounded, but his HQ had not taken enough damage to drive it down.

I won that game by one point. It was a good rebuild for Kevin and with Dan and him coming at me, it ended up being a good fight (Adrian got pasted early, but it was due to the missed rules and not his fault).

I like the no luck combat, the various phases of initiative and the bonus tiles. 

The iconography, much like Race for the Galaxy, works, but takes a bit to learn. Once you learn it, it seems straight forward.

Played this alot on ios.  This is a great setup game that almost feels chess like,as players draw their pieces and play them to the battlefield, before the inevitable conflict which almost eradicates everything from the board and you are left to count the cost of that all important missed opportunity, before building up again ready for the next conflict.

Quick to play and lots of fun.

Definitely not my type of game - sci-fi combat!  But.....I appreciate the gameplay.  I'm not a huge fan of discarding a tile every turn, but it keeps the game moving quite quickly.  Only played a single 2p (Red vs Blue) and we ran out of combat tiles a little over half way through because of bad double draws - seems there should be a way to ixnay that.  The placement and initiative works very well though.

Excellent game. Like a complex chess match where you must think many moves ahead. As a 2 player game this is an absolute battle of wits. With 3 or 4 players it is chaos and still a ton of fun. Recommend this game to anyone who likes complex strategy games and enjoys head-to-head battles. Keeping this game forever and have almost every army/expansion available.

I like the thematic differences in each of the four armies which leads to an endless variety of re-playability, and the draw3/choose2 mechanism helps to alleviate some of the randomness in the draw.

RATING: 8
Futuristic combat with military units on hexagonal tiles that are placed in a grid and then, with another tile, ordered to open fire. Luck in the draw and what's available plays a HUGE roll, while each faction takes a play or two to understand the nuances of its best strategies.

BIG PLUS: unique game mechanic
PLUS: fast play, interactive
MINUS: learning curve over which piece does what, luck required

A rather fun tactical blow stuff up sort of game. With 3 or 4 players it can be a real backstabbing affair. I just got the expansion and really like the idea of having custom terrain to vary it up a bit. We tried one game with 4 players, a larger map, and some terrain, but it may have been too large a playing field, definitely not the carnage we're used to

RATING: 7
An engaging little wargamey abstract (or abstractish wargame?) played out on a small tactical board of hexes. Four factions are available that all play with subtly different types of units. Each player defends a home base and deploys units that can do ranged or melee attacks--and receive strength/initiative bonuses from other adjacent tiles. Periodically battles break out that are resolved quite simply in order from highest initiative units to lowest. It has a moderate initial learning curve, but plays fast and offers plenty of good decisions for its heft. 

My rating is based on the genius official iTouch app available for the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick game of tile laying as players are trying to deal the most damage to their opponents base. The play is on a small board and there is a lot of bloodshed in the game. The armies that come with the game each have a different feel to them which is nice.

RATING: 10
Every time they release more armies, this game gets better and better.  Awesome, quick, purely tactical game.  Lots of luck (less so with Duel rules), but the games are fast, so who cares.  The iOS app, and the fan armies only add to the appeal.

RATING: 7
Fun game for playing lots of pieces, and then resolving all their effects at once, sometimes with surprises. Feels like a competitive, combative puzzle, or like a knotted up shoelace you're trying to untie while trying to knot up the other player's shoelaces.

RATING: 7
A combat game fought by randomly drawing army and action tiles and placing them on a tightly confined hexagonal grid. When a battle action is played, or the board is full, battle ensues. The game is entirely tactical. Players position the tiles they draw as effectively as possible. The base game comes with four armies that have different strengths and weaknesses, and more are available through expansions. The random draw ensures that battles between the same two armies never unfold the same way twice and increases re-playability. There is enough difference between the army units so that the considerations taken when playing a tile are fresh with each placement.

If this game were any longer, I think the random draw would bother me. But the 30 minute play time (up to an hour if you have slow players) is perfect for the kind of game this is.

Un juego táctico donde tienes cuatro facciones diferentes a elegir para jugar sobre un tablero hexagonal. Cada facción tiene un estilo de juego único, pero están bien balanceadas.

A pesar de que no me gusta el tema del juego, está bien diseñado, con un tablero y losetas muy coloridas. Los símbolos de las losetas son bastante buenos y muy fáciles de entender. Pero si lo que estás buscando es un juego temático mejor olvídate de éste porque es un abstracto puro.

A tactical game where you have 4 different factions to choose for playing on a hexagonal board. Each faction has a unique way of playing but they are good balanced.

Despite I don't like the theme of the game, it is good designed with a very colorful board and tiles. Symbols on tiles are also quite good and very easy to understand. But if you are looking for a thematic game you better forget about this one because this game a pure abstract game.

Post-Apocalyptic Ameritrash Mexican-Standoff Chess.

It's got that "if I take you, then you take me, then I take you..." dynamic that occurs with captures in Chess, but, here it's on steroids.

Loved the post-apocalyptic theme and back story. This is a hex-based spatial battle game with an appealing mix of strategy and tactics, randomness and careful planning, which feels very thematic. Each army is asymmetric, so it's fun to discover the strengths and weaknesses of your particular army. It's got an interesting rhythm of "pulses" of bloody battles throughout the game. We played with 4; because it's kind of chess-like, I think it probably would play best with 2, due to downtime.

Note: 3rd ed. has solo variant!!!

UPDATE: having tried the Android App, 2-player against AI, it plays much better 2-player.  Upgrading from 8.5 to 9.5.  Awesome game!

UPDATE:
Upgrading from 9.5 to 10, and this is going in my Top 10.  Brilliant game.  The expansions completely change the strategy and are fun to explore, like Neojungle & The Dancer.

This is a fantastic tactical game with a great post-apocolyptic theme.  It is fast, furious & should be mainly a 2 or 4 player game.  A 3 player game is fun but the tendency to gang up on one of the three players becomes a focused situation (hence the "9" rating) which can leave one player finding themselves thrown into the RAD ZONE--getting nuked off the board.  Players can easily get three games under their belt in a one game night session.  Excellent for filler for a game night which ends early & nobody wants to go home just yet--break it out!  People who like tactics will go for this.  People who like chess will go for this.  It's awesome & I intend to play a lot of it in the near-future.

A strange mix of abstract and thematic (probably more abstract) where players control armies and try to destroy their opponents base. The draw 3, discard 1 rule is a brilliant thing, forcing agonizing decisions and leading to another level of strategy.

This game reminds me of a cross between MtG and Hive. Top marks for player-aid and clear rules. All-in-all an excellent brain-burning filler.

A quick and fun play. 2-4 different factions with different strengths, weaknesses and tactics do battle on an apocalyptic future battlefield. From quick early skirmishes to bloody larger battles where the life expectancy of a combatant is measured in seconds, the fight is fierce. The enjoyment of the game could be hurt by over-analysis causing it to drag, but avoiding that leads to a great play.

RATING: 10
I love this game.  Mechanically simple, strategically deep with just enough random chance that a relatively new player can stand a chance against a more experienced player (especially in multiplayer).

Variant rules in the box AND an extra (slightly overpowered[Doomsday Machine]) race available in the box, so you get a LOT of value out of the starter set alone.

I have very little negative critique for this game, occasionally mother fate can see it fit to screw you over, this can be remedied by a slight modification on the draw rules for more experienced players (to ensure less random and more strategy).

This is one of the most succinct games around and there is next to no setup time and gameplay is short (don't recommend 4 player as it starts to drag.

I would buy this & all the expansions if I had the free money, space, time to play and friends to play it with regularly! :)

The variety in each tribe is just so good. The individual armies create a beautiful asymmetric experience. There is  luck involved, but thats mitigated by player skill. If you make better decisions then you will most certainly win. Adapting to the draw of tiles is what makes the game so tense. Ultimately making for a super competitive experience that involves a lot of tactics.  The game length also makes this neuroshima wonderful for a late night game.

A deeply abstract, very complex game (with additional layers of complexity each time I play it) that masquerades as a light, multiplayer wargame. The mood isn't as engrossing as other games, probably due to the arcane nature of the sheer amount of information they put on each tile. A big chunk of each game I've plaued has involved trying to figure out what each of the small little icons mean. This slows the game down and also means people make a lot of errors during their turns. 

This game also irritates me because it comes in a gigantic box relative to what you get for it. Not a big deal and it's nothing I took points off for but that kind of thing just personally bugs me.

One of the best games I've played. It is fast paced with quite a lot of thinking. Not much of planning actually, more like adjusting to the current situation on the board and taking advantage of drawn tiles. Rules are simple but offer endless possibilities.

The biggest downside of the game is randomness. It can lead even the best player to losing the game.

It's designed for two players and works best for two. Three player game often leads to kingmaking. Four player game in teams 2vs2 can be fun from time to time, especially if one of the players has Moloch army.

No matter how many times I played it I could never get into this game. I understand the puzzle-like aspect of the game: that you are in this chaotic firefight in a small arena-like area and you never know what is going to happen next. But for me, the random tile draw killed the game for me, because it makes the game too much like Klondike solitaire. There is little sense of strategy here, and NH is obviously intended to be a strategy game. Like cooperative games, how you do depends almost entirely upon what you draw, and I don't like that.

As the game continues, you expect the tension to mount, but as the board fills up you actually have fewer and fewer choices, so it is obvious what you should do each turn. Ultimately, the fact that you cannot choose when your units will fire their weapons killed it for me. You have all these badass units in a rich post-apocalyptic setting and yet for the most part they just stand there.

I like the idea of setting up your units in a confined space, and the units here are very well done, but what you do with them (or, rather, what you can't do with them) makes this game fall flat with me.

Chyba najbardziej znana gra Michała Oracza. Kilkanaście różnicowanych gatunków pszczół a jeden ul do zdobycia. Zwykle walczą na raz dwa gatunki, na przemian atakują swoich rywali i ich królową. Grzeczne są i karne bo każdy czeka na swoją kolej by użądlić w zależności od poziomu swojej inicjatywy. Wojownicy mają zróżnicowane umiejętności i bronie, niektórzy mogą atakować w kilku kierunkach, niektórzy tylko osłaniają lub paraliżują przeciwników. Brak trutni. Nikt tu nikogo nie zapyla. ;) Dwa nowe gatunki już powstają w laboratoriach czyli MOracz pracuje nad dwoma nowymi frakcjami - jedna może nawet w tym roku na Essen.
Sprytna i bardzo popularna gra, szkoda że w klimatach postapo. Równie dobrze mogło by być o magach w świecie fantasy, o postaciach z bajek robiących sobie psikusy walcząc o tort, bakteriach chcących zdobyć DNA komórki lub jak wyżej dzikie pszczoły. Wiem że to nie o pszczołach ale dla tych co nie znają to wszystko jedno co napiszę, ogólny zarys jest prawdziwy, a ci co znają przecie nie muszą czytać ;p

The different armies are asymmetrical, but balanced. No dice, although there is the element of luck in the drawing of the tiles! **** Played with four in two teams - great fun! Probably best as a pure two player game.

I love this game!
Nice and short, easy to pick up (May take one game to fully understand)  Simple strategic placement of units to battle it out, team up or do a free for all.
Simply put, all units have an initiative, and attack in turn order.  If someone places a unit attacking your base, you can place a faster unit attacking his unit.  In turn you can kill his unit before it attacks your base.
But battles don't happen that fast.  Usually he will counter you by putting a unit to attack your unit that is attacking his, that is attacking your base!  Get all that? :D
Good cause that's just the tip of the iceberg

I love a well-done, abstract game, which this is.  NH packs in a lot of flavor, with four interesting armies that work differently.  Randomness generates tough choices and replayability.  It plays fast.  The only downside is that I perceive a hierarchy of power influencing the outcome of two-player games.  From most powerful to least, the armies are: 1) Borgo, 2) Outpost, 3) Moloch and 4) Hegemony.  I would prefer greater balance.  Borgo seems particularly out of line.

A really really good game which suffers a bit because of the phenomenal app. It's better in its digital form than in its physical one. Nevertheless a game with a ton of replayibility. It plays very fast and straight forward which I like. Sadly for a two player game it hasn't got the right setting to play it with my spouse. It's too dark and post-apocalyptic for her taste.

Tight tactics game that feels very much like post-apocalyptic chess. Easy to teach, quick to play, with good amount of depth. Would like to see a little more variety in the units and board.

Juego muy interesante. Sólo lo he jugado a dos. Combina perfectamente mecánicas de "abstracto sesudo" con combate futurista y conquista, además los 4 bandos son distintos y se juegan de forma diferente. Lo único "malo" es la alta influencia de la suerte al coger aleatoriamente las fichas, a veces hay rachas que no te permiten casi jugar.

A hex-tiled armies medium wargame that's played on a hexagonal arena filled with hexes.  Each piece has it's very own special powers and abilities, and some with area effects and some with multiple attacks and different varying degrees of skills.  Very innovative design with hexes, tactical skills and cumulative effects from round to round.  It's fairly simple to play as you just simply draw a tile and execute at least one or two of them...  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Aggressive tile laying game in which you are seeking to take out your opponents' base/units.  Some tiles are units with varying abilities and some tiles refer to instantaneous events such as battle, move, grenade, airstrike and the like.  Each of the four armies have different units which will force you to implement different strategies in most instances.  Interesting concept for gameplay, I just didn't really enjoy the game so much.  Game play is much better if you can play with a knowledge of what strengths and weaknesses each of the different armies have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Euro style gameplay and components with a conflict/wargame agenda. I like this type of game, in general. There were things with Neuroshima Hex that bothered me some. The random pulls can really imbalance a two player game if the pulls aren't equal. Exponentially so in a four player game. Still, not bad.

Is Poland the gaming heaven? This is the second game from Portal Publishing that has been excellent. I wanted this game for so long, and it didn't disappoint. 

[u]Updated Comments:[/u]
After trading away Neuroshima Hex a number of years ago I recently got a chance to give it another go, and I am really glad I did. The rules are tight, and the gameplay fast and furious, and easy to understand. NH is still one of the most tactical games you can find in the non-wargame space for boardgames. The new armies definitely add to the complexity and the replayability of the game. The components are pretty well made, although a better graphic designer could really have made this game really pop. Although I really enjoyed my game of NH, I don't feel as though I need to have the game in my collection.

Unique light wargame with a great deal of tactical interest.  Clever manipulation of the initiative, placement and facing of units must be combined with timing the battles to optimize one's play.  Tile draw and placement reminded me vaguely of Knizia's Samurai but the conflict is obviously much more overt.

Great game for 2. You can get unlucky with tile draws, but it isn't that big of an issue as the game plays relatively fast. Biggest problem is the possibility of over-analysis.
Also the Dutch/German edition doesn't have player aids, and the tiles aren't really perfectly cut (centre is off), which is unfortunate.

One of my all-time favorite games.  It takes the abstract strategy of Hive and muddies it up with variable powers, and a dash of luck, which takes the pressure off some people.  When you lose in Hive, it's because YOU lost.  When you lose in Neuroshima, there's a good chance you were outplayed, but there's also the possibility you had some bad luck.

Each faction plays/feels different, some of which are so different that it almost feels like a different game.  Each requires different strategies to play/play against, creating TONS of variability with the total amount of factions.

A great tactical battle game that does not strike me as being nearly as abstract as I heard it described.  Definitely has the feel of a knife fight in a phonebooth at times.  If I am looking for a tactical conflict game, I would play this in place of C&C games, because you could play NH twice before you even set up the scenario for C&C.  This has replaced LotR:tC as my two-player quick conflict game of choice.  The mechanic of  essentially combining gameplay with setup is done brilliantly.  The tile draws and no-luck-combat are just the right mix of luck and strategy to keep maximum tension going through the game.  This really is a two-player game.  I have not and do not plan on trying multi-player much, as it seems it is prone to frustrating AP and two-on-one situations.  

Update:  I am hooked!  Looking forward to trying out fan-generated armies and whatever new ones Portal is putting out.

The apparent "resolutions" calculations seem to have a great educational benefit (read: heavy analysis) but MAY kill it for the students I have in mind who would be playing it; in that it would take forever to complete a game. 

Maybe, get them hooked on an iTouch version and then consider the game.

Played once against my friend in his iPAD. Very abstract game which may be interesting for someone, but definitely not my cup of tea.

I absolutely love this game. I have purchases only the app, but love it so much I'll get the board game to introduce it to my group. The strategy, the competition, the frustration, the brutality, the cleverness, the strange backstory. There is nothing not to love about this game. Don't let the theme fool you; the gameplay here is spectacular and uses the theme only to advantage and perfection. Get this game.

After several games against humans and many against AI, I know clearly see what a great game it is!
With 2 players it's much more strategical once they both get to know the armies, so as to know what tiles are remaining.
With 3-4 its pure chaos! Everyone against everyone and you hope that they won't gank you!
Great expansions, much needed after a while!

Fun ameritrash with some cyberpunk bands killing each other following a complex tactical pattern.

I found this game fun to play with any number of players, from 1 to 4. Also I've tried six different official sides and each one has different strengths and weaknessess, making each of them interesting to play, while remaining balanced.

RATING: 9
Man do I love this game. Before trying it I heard it described two ways: as a knife fight in a phone both, and as being like filling up a room with mousetraps and then tossing in a ball. Both analogies are apt, brilliant, and entirely fitting.

With very low rules overhead and a short play time, NH crams a ton of tough decision-making, just the right amount of luck, a great deal of variety, lots of tension, novel gameplay, and a ton of fun into a very, very tight package. It's a thing of beauty. It's also easy to learn and easy to play without lacking strategic depth.

My only niggling complaint is that the board is too busy. I wish the game came with an alternate board of the minimum size necessary for a two-player game.

Rating based on 3 players.

This is right up my alley. Head-to-head tactical fight-n'-fight, a constantly changing puzzle with deterministic combat, a little bit of hand management to introduce an element of timing, and some luck-of-the-draw. It is a little bit on the fiddly side (I can imagine how the digital version would be much smoother to play), but I imagine some of that would be lessened with repeated play. The setting of the game holds no attraction for me.

3 / 5 - Good.

I can see where the fun is in this - there's a good balance between the random nature of the tile draw and good strategy and tactics in using what you've drawn. However the entirely deterministic nature of the tile effects is hugely off-putting - trying to work out what will affect what when both during planning and battles is a pain in the arse. I'm also turned off by the somewhat abstract nature of the game: there's no narrative or sense of maneuver here at all.

I have played this game, the app, and the puzzle app to death and I still love it. Abstract puzzle-wargame with decks of hex tiles. Utterly superb system with very different armies. Yes, luck of the draw can affect how well you do, but good play will out. The tactical variant reduces the randomness, but it also realllllly drags the game out. I own the Z-Man 3.0 edition which has clearer art and the previously Essen-only Doomsday Machine army.

Best played as a two player duel.

Amazing game!  Plays fast and really easy to understand rules.  It also helps that all the necessary icons are on the tiles themselves.  You can clearly see how each units shoots \ fights and in which direction.

I love thematic games; theme is the 1st thing I look for in a game.  I was initially unsure about Neuroshima Hex as it looked too abstract for me; the whole puzzle element of it and the mechanics. For example, the fact that units cannot battle until a battle tile is played (or the board is full), seemed anti-thematic for me.  However, once I started playing it all fell into place.  The theme really comes through for me, and each unit \ side feels like it should.  Fast scouts, tough lumbering robots, nukes, etc.

I also enjoy the Android App version which is a great way to play NH! on the go.

Fast, exciting, and very tense - it takes the strong points of games like The Duke, For the Crown, chess, etc. and mixes it with deck builder/trading card games while smoothing out the deficiencies of both.

The forced discard and small "hand" size smooths out good draws and bad draws from players and the small board size favors fast and frantic action, even if you're a defensive faction like New York.

The number and variety of other units keeps the game feeling fresh, as games will require different tactics depending on a lot of different factors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Neuroshima Hex is a fast pace "Wargamy" strategy game.  You control an army and you must destroy your ennemy base or at least weaken it enough to win the game at the end of the quite fast phases.

I like it but I found it was lacking in the depth department.  Maybe it was because the chance is a somewhat big factor in the order in which the tile are gain.

In any case, since the game is so fast pace, it could be a good idea to play reverse role like in Space Hulk or Command and Color.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An unbelievably complex game for something so simple. Lay a bunch of hex tiles, each of which can be attacking, defensive, carrying initiative or modifiers. Each army is different, with units which have special strengths and weaknesses.

For something so straightforward, there's a lot of depth and complexity, with various tile interactions further complicating the mix. The basic mechanisms are really straightforward - lay two of three tiles and discard the other; draw back up to three as the next person takes their turn. When a Battle tile is played, perform the actions on the tiles in order of initiative. It's genius, but it's also very easy to miss something, so there is complexity in the tile interactions which isn't always obvious and things can get missed. With so many armies, and with the variety of abilities, learning how to play them can be daunting, but the replay ability is excellent. If you're not a fan of reading swathes of icons, this probably isn't for you.

This would be a 10 if it weren't so easy to screw up the book-keeping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The perfect two player game for me. The confined space and the clever core-mechanics grant a solid base, which the different armies can use in their unique ways to create a fast flowing, mind-blowingly exciting, deeply satisfying battle which requires fast thinking and quick adaptation. 

To make it even better, the game has the most prolific fan base, constantly pulling astonishing armies out of the hat, giving the game such variety I can't find anywhere else.

The most common complaint against NH is the randomness of the tile drawing, however it's based on mainly prejudice or after one or two plays. Knowing your armies and wisely taking risks you can effectively manage your hand to reduce the luck factor. You can still lose because of an extremely unlucky streak, true that, but most of the time the better player will win the game. Moreover, taking away the randomness would reduce the game to a sterile puzzle, as exciting as a Swiss clockwork.

Interesting game that powers along, but there seems little value in not churning through the tiles as fast as possible, might be different with a 2 or 3 player game. And if there's one thing I dislike in games, it's churning cards or tiles as fast as possible (might as well play "Go Fish" or "Snap" or "Simpson's Slam Dunk"). Nice theme to the game.

RATING: 6.5
Intriguing title. Relatively simple and well streamlined rules for a simultanious-action tactical combat game. If selected right, the factions play noticably differently. Suffers from slightly non-distinct iconography on the tiles, especially for the distinction between health and initiative, and from cognitive overload from a huge number of things to consider when placing tiles, which might make playing with AP-prone players a tedium. The same goes when resolving effects: it is easy to make mistakes due to the wide array of interactions to consider. Recommended for people that like tactical battles with little luck involved.

RATING: 8
Totally in love with this game right now; it's my favorite in my collection.  I love the asymmetry of the armies, and the brutal immediacy of every turn.  While there is some long-term strategy, most of game is played in the HERE and NOW, where every new tile can be a game-changer.  And it's oh so satisfying when you can set up your tiles to pull off an awesome combo and you get to battle before your opponent goes and screws it all up for you.  Every game is different, and every battle feels like a mini-climax.  

A thrilling, tactical, bloody, awesome game.

Edit: (6/19/11)  I brought this down to a 9 because I don't feel the burning need to play it all the time.  I still really enjoy the game, but it's not perfect.  It's hard to put my finger on why it's not a 10, but I think it may be the AP that can occur, as well as a little too much randomness.  I still really like the game though and am looking forward to playing with my new copy of the Babel 13 expansion!

Edit: Somewhat sad to be trading this away, but it just doesn't see any plays with all the other games I have now.  Also, there's the excellent tablet version to play when I get the itch.

Edit: REACQUIRED!  Found v2.0 on the used shelf at Millennium for $20.  Took a look inside and BOTH Babel13 and Duel expansions were inside!  And, based on how the counters are bagged, I have the feeling that these were punched and never played!  I couldn't help myself.  Welcome home, friend!

RATING: 6
I'm torn on this one. It is not, strictly speaking, a wargame or pure AmeriTrash. It could easily be an abstract, and it's got a strong puzzle element.

However, the theme, board and pieces, plus the fact that there are lots of shootings, maulings and explosions, make this interesting to me.

Certainly the luck element is strong in the tile draw. However, I have not played it enough to decide whether the luck element is too strong. I'm leaning toward the conclusion that the game is short enough that I don't care.

My main complaint (again, regarding the Z-Man 2nd edition) is the horrific rulebook with tiny black print on a dark red background. Clearly this graphic design element was created by a monkey or an A.I. or someone who ate lead paint chips as a child. How in Hell did this get approved? For your sanity and your eyesight, download the BGG file with the red background stripped out and print that.

The rule book isn't especially well written, but I didn't find it to be all that bad. Certainly it's not as clear as the typical Euro rule book. But Euros only need two-page rule books (half of that being pictures of beige cubes), have no complicated moving parts and have no impenetrable mechanics other than (maybe) a scoring system that defies all sense and reason. Compared to a wargame or pure AmeriTrash classic, these rules are pretty easy.

Pay no attention to people who complain about the "math" and the simultaneous combat resolution. It is not difficult at all in practice. A couple battles should be all you need to grasp it. I'm not a math guy at all, and I have no trouble with it. Frankly, it's simpler than a lot of the "count the number of merchants in red spaces, subtract a point for every blue latrine inspector in your hand, award five points to the person who captured the Trophy of Beigeness and give five, four, three and two points, respectively, to the players with the most orange jesters alone in a space next to a foreign dignitary marker" type of scoring systems.

The components are nice, there's a reasonable amount of variety in the base game (Z-Man 2nd edition), it's a fun kind of asymmetrical and I flat out enjoy chaos and carnage. So I think it is fun for what it is and will continue to be an occasional play for me.

I'm slightly concerned that the Moloch bomb piece is too powerful. Just knowing it's out there strongly affects how you place your pieces, effectively shrinking the board.

The Android app is pretty good, too. No tile shuffling, setup or math worries.

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  Neuroshima Hex! is a battle game with a very puzzly combat resolution.  It takes place in a post apocalyptic world where several different factions, which all fight in their own unique way, battle for supremacy.  It plays 2+ players, but it's best at 1v1, IMO.  But because of the random draw of unit tiles each turn and the nature of the game's initiative resolution during combat, it works quite well for me solo playing all sides.

I had played a couple hundred sessions of this game via the iOS app before finally breaking down and purchasing a physical copy.  Since then, I've played several times against myself and have a blast with it.  I do love that puzzly nature of the gameplay, and with so many different factions available, the matchups are endless.

The version I have also comes with the solitaire deck of game puzzles, but after looking them over and setting up one or two, I decided it was just too fiddly for the effort.  Only a small number of specific tiles are seeded to the board, and you are allowed to use choose from only a small handful of specific tiles to solve the problem being presented.  In that amount of time, I could almost play a complete one on one game by myself...which is preferable.

[u]18-Nov-2017[/u]:  Just a brief comment to retract my statement about the solo cards.  Yes, they are very fiddly, but after playing a few of them now, I actually enjoyed the process of setting up the specific situation, decided on my solution, and resolving the puzzle.  I would say my preferred way to play solo is still two-handed, but I am looking forward to trying more of the puzzles, especially as they increase in difficulty.

Each player chooses an army and then shuffles a stack of tiles that they draw from.  These tiles contain various troops and modules each with special powers, boosts, attacks, defense, etc.  Tiles are placed on one of the hexes (usually surrounding your base) within the small board everybody shares and they fire, defend, etc. towards certain hex sides.  Enjoy the powers and the tactical play but was nonplussed by how stagnant the board was.  Tiles are constantly added and removed but armies don't really move around.  It's sort of a multi-player tower defense game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great. Also, not like chess! A little work the first time through to figure out what all the symbols mean and more importantly how they interact. The helper modules or whatever they're called are particularly interesting - could take a while to figure out how to best use those. You're going to have good replayability because of the different characteristics of the different armies. And I really don't mind the luck at all. Drawing three tiles mutes it, and more importantly it's such a quick game that you're probably going to play again anyway. I could easily see playing this ten times in a row, which I'd much rather do than one longer game.

Way better with two than with four, which adds not only a kingmaker issue but a whole mess of AP.

RATING: N/A
I think that someone described this as throwing a ping-pong ball into a room full of mousetraps. Not sure I have much to add. Certainly, choosing two out of three randomly drawn tiles seems to add to much luck. (Is there a variant where I get to presort my stack of tiles?) Not attracted to the many additional armies and the overall puzzle-like appearance.

(020914) The android version. I can understand how this might be slightly unwieldy as a traditional board game. However, I don't feel that it would detract from the fact that Neuroshima Hex! is a brilliant game that plays quite fast once you get it down, offers excellent tactical possibilities, feels extremely balanced after 30-or-so plays and most importantly, keeps entertaining. I've been recommending this for most of my friends.

Played once with four players (with no teams), three times as a two-player game, and twice as a four-player team game.  The game is far better as a two player game or a team game.

In this game players draw chips that represent units, which they then place on a board to use to attack other players' units or bases.  Each player has distinct forces that have different abilities, which require different strategies to use effectively. Battles only occur when a specific token is drawn and played by a player, and during battles _all_ units fight (not just those of one player), making timing of battles important (and also making it deliciously uncertain when a battle will occur).

The map was extremely tight with four players; it was very hard to build up combinations of characters before a fight began.  This game was fairly frantic with four players, but with two it was perfect.  There was much more strategy involved, yet the board changed frequently enough that building massive (undefendable) combos was pretty much impossible.  

This game needs at least one preliminary play through to see how it works and get a feel for the units.

[Update: Initially I gave this game a 7.5 after a four player game; it's now got 8.25, thanks to the good two-player play.]

I like this tile laying game. Lots of variety with the different factions. It is a nice tactical puzzle.

Downloaded the free iPhone app for this game, Neuroshima Hex Light, in which you can play one race or so, and on the easy setting.

Seems interesting but hard to make out. Don't quite get it yet.

Place tiles to destroy your opponent’s tiles.

Plays: More than 100, all on iOS against the AI.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 30 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict.
Randomness: Medium – tile draw.

Replayability: High. It’s quick so why not go again? There is also depth to explore.
Fun: The fun lies in working out the tile puzzle to your advantage. 
Memorability: Low, it’s really an abstract puzzle game.

Thematic integration: Weak. The presentation is weirdly heavy on theme, but it plays like a puzzle abstract.
Components: No comment, only played on iOS.

Who will like this: The iOS version is perfect for gamers that want a quick gaming fix when they have a minute to spare. I have a hard time seeing who would play this face to face.

A game I really wish I could have addicted at least SOMEONE in one my of groups to- I really think this is a stellar, surprisingly difficult design. Perhaps the disconnect between expectation and reality does this one a disservice; this doesn't FEEL like one might expect a wargame to feel. There's nothing else really like it.

New rating - 8.5 to 9.5 on 12/26/17

After many, many moons of owning this game, I finally have a moment and the wherewithal to compose a short review. This continues to be one of my favorite games of all time, in spite of (because of?) many dozens of playthroughs with veterans and novices alike. A game which FORCES tactical thinking due to a limited hand size, a constantly-changing board, and pieces with such small survivability as to be the chosen poster children for "impermanence" as an idea... keep on signing me up.

Imma keep playing.

Quite a thinky little tactical game. Although it plays quite quickly, this one's worth taking a little AP to fully appreciate. Reacting to the board and what troops you get, whilst thinking about the possible interplays of which troops may come up next gives a lot of juicy bang for your buck!

RATING: 9
I find Neuroshima Hex! to be endlessly intriguing. I've played it well over 100 times. It's very tactical, but it certainly pays to track your enemy's capabilities and remaining potential. A clever, experienced, and knowledgable player should be at an advantage. Yet after all those plays I am still nagged by the feeling that a few too many games boil down to the luck of the draw (hence the rating of 9 rather than 10).

I have the Babel 13 and Duel expansions and several additional armies: Dancer, Mephisto, Mississippi, SteelPolice (store-bought), Behemoths and Uranopolis (home-made). Favorite army: Smart. Also have the iPad game and puzzle apps, which are excellent. [124 cardboard plays, and 500+ more with the app (mostly four-army games)]

I have recently gotten into this game, though I have had the APP on my phone for awhile I had never really played. When I finally set down and played a game it is right up my alley! The games are quick and hardly ever last over 30 minutes! The strategy and background fluff are all very well done. There are no extraneous bits of artwork or things to detract from gameplay. It is as if the designer took a game idea and stripped away everything he didn't need or would slow the game down. I actually started playing this game when one of my beta testers ask if I was trying to make my own version of Neuroshima Hex! when I introduced them to my upcoming game Strategy Tile Battles. I replied that I hadn't really played it and started playing, STB is different but I can understand their initial question (they had only read my write-up). 8/10 Try it! TCG players will feel at home as will wargamers!

It turns out I like the idea of this game far more than the actual game. Severely overrated game. It's completely possible (and not all that rare) to lose the game within the first 2-3 turns just by getting crappy tile draws. This fact alone makes it not my kind of game. It gets a few points for concept, though. Could be a decent game if they managed to mitigate the luck a bit better, and addressed some of the balance issues.

Cool mix of Carcassone and Summoner Wars, yet very different! :) Many cheap expansions. Scales well, asymetric, a little abstract but theme integrates well. Each game is different, and there is lots of space for customization (e.g. draw 4 tiles, not 3 to make game even less random). There is little space for luck, only in tile drawing - all the rest depend on you and I really like that.

Latest release is super cool and beautiful. Having said tLat, I think v3.0 is underrated, because rating is common for all versions. Latest is just so much better in terms of both production quality and rules/balance... you can safely add +1 to the bgg rating.

Very logical puzzle-ish strategy game. Great theme although it is kind of pasted on. The multiple interactions on the (small) board can get complex fast and when battles start, all hell breaks loose.

A very abstract wargame that is extremely fast and fun to play.  PROS: Little luck (tile drawing); unique army composition; fast play (at least for 2 players); high replayability.  CONS:  Not much for the high price tage (nice unecessarily big sturdy box, but just okay components--mainly a bunch of thick stock counters, but not much more for almost USD$60); should have included reference card; rules could be organized better (and clearer).  Overall, pros outweigh cons.  This will see a lot of game play over time.

I love the tension in this game: a gradual amassing of pieces, and then every so often someone lobs a tennis ball into the roomful of mousetraps and the destruction begins! That said, battles must be rather tedious to work out by hand: I've only ever played this via the cellphone app, which makes battles whizz by in a hurry.

AFTER SOME MORE PLAYS: eh, base game feels just too random. You can't plan because you can't hang onto tiles, and sometimes you just get stuck drawing a bunch of action tiles or boosters when you need firepower to lay down on the board. The right move and strategy are pretty obvious (create as thick a wall of your own pieces around your HQ as possible, and point guns at everyone else). Lots of fun, but limited.

UPDATE:  Yeah, I'm lowering this a bit.  Where NH fails for me is in its "gamey-ness."  The pieces are powers are so evocative, but the rules choke off the innovation and jerk you out of the narrative.  Too bad...beautifully produced game.

A cool, crunchy, sci-fi battle game with some lovely unique combat mechanisms.  It took an hour of reading from the rules and a false start to get going for our four-player session, whereas now with one game played I could explain this in under ten minutes.  We did NOT play with the deathmatch scenario, so with 4 players there was a lot of "beat the leader" and kingmaking going on.  Still, a very thematic, unique and quick game.  I look forward to more from this "franchise."

RATING: 10
This game is excellent.   Plays very fast with a built in timer in that you must throw away one of your tiles every turn and when they're gone the game's over.

Truly horrible decisions to make every turn.  You must draw so that three tiles are in front of you and you MUST discard one of them never to be used again.  Most often you will find yourself and others lamenting that if you could just place all three you would have that game in the bag!  But it is not to be... Which one goes to the garbage and what will you do with the rest of them?

Strangely it's both very abstract AND very thematic at the same time.

I have come to really love this game.

I would very much like to make some custom armies for it.  With this option it has the potential to stay fresh for years and years.

This is a unique and excellent design, which pits two adversaries in a tight battleground as they aim to maneuver their faction to take out the enemy's headquarters first. 

Using hexagonal units, the game plays much like an abstract as the players position their units to make the most of melee units and long range troops. As each new unit is added to the field of play, the rules of engagement can change and all manner of chain reactions can occur. 

Neuroshima Hex is as much puzzle as it is game and finding the chink in the armour of the opponent is what it is all about. 

Really great stuff.

My love for this game faded a little with time, but I still like it. I love that it can be complex with few pieces. It's not super elegant and has a modestly high learning curve, but when played with the right opponent it can truly shine. 

The luck element is present as you draw tiles, but you can still choose what do do with them! Also, each and every faction feels different from all the others. Fun!

Really fun game that is also well designed, technically and aesthetically. A few shortfalls prevent this game from being excellent. Currently I prefer the iOS version of the game.

PROS
-Quick.
-Intuitive.
-Good decisions, planning and tactical.
-Great iOS app, streamlines the game. 

CONS
-Can have a lot of account keeping during a battle, which is prone to error and increased game length. However this is eliminated in the iOS app (automatically done perfectly).
-Unfortunate luck of the draw can be devastating to your game, leaving you absolutely helpless in some cases. Furthermore winning against an opponent that was in this situation is not enjoyable at all.
-Potential uneven matches between certain decks. For instance, on the iOS version, I win consistently against all AI matches except green faction (me) versus the red faction. Red can completely nullify and out-manevoure greens special abilities and strengths easily.  

LIKE TO SEE
-One or two time chance to mulligan (re-draw) at any point during the game. Anything to minimise bad luck of the draw. 
-Have some instant actions that can be played at any point in the game (e.g. a mulligan or move troop action). These could be as cards or square chits that are not shuffled into the deck, able to use one per turn and discarded once used.

The ultimate mexican standoff game.
Everyone places their soldiers and aims at each other until someone plays the shoot token. Then, of course almost everyone dies. 

Can be described as a knife fight in a phone booth. It's a tight space and almost everyone dies....

You really have to think ahead in order to win this game.

Played the app version a lot but I won't log those plays.

[b]Theme: 5/5[/b]

[b]Luck: 3/5[/b] This was what caused this game to not be a 10 rating. This used to be my favorite game. This probably won't happen in every game, but you will eventually pull a full hand of modules or instant actions tiles, or pull very few units until the end, or draw a ton of units in the beginning and have to keep discarding them. For how quick this game is, and the fact that your opponent will probably occasionally come across this same problem, it isn't game killing, but it is frustrating, and it isn't frustrating for the right reasons.

I'm surprised at how much I like this game.
Although there are many different kinds of units in the game, it is very quick and easy to learn. My son and I thought that we'd try it out quickly one day before going out, and ended up playing an entire game with no problems.
My 10 year old son likes it very much.

Update 3-12-09: Had the game for about a week and am bumping it from an 8 to a 9. Already logged 16 plays. It's fast and fun and unlike anything else in my collection. Both my son and my main gaming buddy really like it, so it should see plenty of play.

RATING: 7
Neuroshima Hex!'s iconography is far simpler to understand than I expected. To aid players, reference cards are provided for each faction.

The whole game feels like one of those Mexican standoffs that you see in action movies where two characters who don't trust each other point guns at the other's head. Then more guys pour in on either side and begin pointing guns at the other team until someone trips or coughs or something and then everyone starts firing and a bloodbath ensues. But then it happens again, and again until one side is well and truly dead.

Neuroshima Hex! is easy to learn, quick to set-up and to play, and random enough that new players have a fair chance at winning.

I only wish that I had gotten version 3.0. The graphical changes streamline the iconography a bit and the 55 solo puzzles give the game life when no one else is around to play against.

A conceptually brilliant battle game. Quick, tactical, and confrontational - "a knife fight in a telephone booth," in the apt words of Zee Garcia. The asymmetric armies are a primary attraction but also the game's downfall, as few of the matchups end up being fair. The red army feels a bit weak against the yellow and green armies; those in turn get clobbered by the blue army, which is itself vulnerable to the red army. The only evenly-matched contest is between yellow and green, and that is a disappointment.

RATING: N/A
With all of the different pieces to keep track of, this is a difficult game the first time through. Also, since you pick up 2-3 tiles on your turn, your options are fairly limited. I'd try it again, but it's not high on my priority list. There is alot going on all at once. You need to keep track of which pieces are netted, which have bonuses, which are targeting other pieces or bases, and which are able to move. There is way too much happening.

A very original, short, abstract wargame with variable player powers. The four player team game is excellent, but a has a bit of downtime. Best with two players.

The second edition has a larger board, which could be used for scenarios later on,  but the graphics are better in the first edition. Also, the second edition uses a scoring track instead of the hit point wheels for the bases, which is a serious downgrade in usability.

Facciamo a botte in questo wargame, scacchistico, profondo, cattivo ma simpatico. Un astratto 'ambientato' dove non manca la componente fortuna (pesca delle tessere), ma il gioco riesce a conquistare comunque grazie anche all'asimmetria delle varie truppe! Da provare. Simpatica anche la versione a doppia coppia, ma il gioco mi sembra adatto soprattutto per 2 giocatori.

(own Android app)

First of all: I really suck at this game. :D
It's what I would call a "semi-abstract" game and I really don't know how to rate this. I enjoy it quiet a bit, but played it only once - I think - actually on a board and there it's just a little bit too much bookkeeping, which to me kind of gets in the way of the flow of the game a little. 
I do therefore much prefer it on phone/tablet as the app does all the bookkeeping for you. 
So in the end I'm not sure how to rate the "boardgame" itself as a big part of me enjoying it, is due to the app making it easier.

I have only played the Android version. It almost feels like a more abstract iteration of Magic the Gathering, but with a nice spatial element integrated as well. It can feel deterministic, but there's a simple beauty to the way earlier decisions hugely impact the game. 

I also like how players decide when battles occur, rather than automatic attacks every turn or whatever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played it once. I think the gameplay itself is probably worthy of an 8, but the game can drag a bit, and there are potentially lots of fiddly tile management things to do. These knock it down a point. This one benefits from playing on a tablet, I'd imagine.

RATING: 7
First play (3p) the other night. I liked it, as did one other player (the third is more of a strategy gamer and found this game a little too loose and not-his-cup-of-tea). I definitely feel that knowing your army's capabilities is huge - which means there's a learning curve to ascend. Given how much fun the first game was, it's a hill I'm looking forward to climbing. My thinking is that this might shine best as a 2p game - the three player Deathmatch was awfully tight quarters. Perhaps extending the board into the red hexes would help, as players could position their forces more strategically? I'll need to cast about the 'net to see if there are any official variants for multiplayer.

還不錯玩的戰爭版塊下棋遊戲
不過APP玩起來可能會方便很多
不然光是算誰先啟動就累了
發現現在多數電玩版桌遊都是這個領域
規則:
*(兩人規則)每人拿一個種族的35板塊洗勻蓋著，總部20滴血(圖板紀錄或是用記錄轉盤)，隨機起始，起始先放總部到圖板上，次家再放，然後手家抽一個板塊放面前可棄或保留或使用，次家抽兩個同樣使用或棄掉或保留
*遊戲目標先把對方總部20滴打完，或是結束時總部血比較多
*遊戲照順位每次面前補到三個開的板塊，棄掉一個，然後剩下的使用或棄掉或保留直到結束
*如果玩家面前三個都是使用板塊則可以全部棄掉重抽，可重複多次
*板塊分兩種，使用板塊使用完功能棄掉，單位板塊則放到圖板上
*戰鬥 當使用戰鬥板塊或是圖板放滿時啟動，照啟動數字大到小一個一個啟動板塊攻擊同數字的同回合造成傷害，超過血量的就棄掉，沒超過的放受傷標記，觸發戰鬥的玩家結算後結束回合不能棄或使用板塊
*當有玩家抽完最後一個板塊，該回合結束後對手再進行一回合後就入最後戰鬥，遊戲結束，有人抽完板塊時不能使用戰鬥板塊，平手再進行各自最後一回合在戰鬥一次(沒板塊的不能抽)，在平手就平手
**板塊簡介**
>上面數字是啟動階段，有兩個則每次戰鬥會啟動兩次
>短三角一個會往該方向相鄰格攻擊一次
>長三角遠距離往該方向攻擊第一個看到的敵軍一次
>圓弧 該方向遠距攻擊-1
>網 該方向相鄰單位放置一個網，該單位所有功能取消，不能攻擊只能被打
>箭頭 該單位每回合可以移動一格或是換方向
>盾牌 每個盾牌多一滴血
>模組 只對有長方形相連的單位有效果 可加攻擊加啟動，或是代替檔一滴血
>移動板塊 可移動一格換方向或是換方向，被網不能移動
>往後推板塊 一個友軍把敵軍往後推一格，使用後如果後方有兩個則對手選擇退到哪一格
>手榴彈 消滅一個跟你總部相鄰的單位，總部被網不能使用，不能用在總部
>狙擊 對一個單位造成一 點傷害，不能用在總部
>空襲 照上選擇移格跟相鄰格的所有單位一點傷害，包括友軍，對總部無效
*總部不能打另外一個總部
*兩個網板塊互網會互相取消沒效果，如果串聯一樣取消
*啟動數字最低是0，不會到負的
**變體***
*首家起始抽3棄1，選1使用另1只能存著，次家抽3棄1，兩塊可使用保留或棄掉
*更策略 每次補到6個，棄1，一定要保留3
**3人**
1.起始首家抽1，次家2，三家3，之後正常，任何一個玩家抽完板塊其他人在一回合就進入最後戰鬥，總部0滴的馬上淘汰板塊移除
2.設置同1但是總部起始0滴，每次造成總部傷害加一滴，先20滴的獲勝
3.1打多 單1的起始20滴，另外兩位13，順位為首次首三，起始照這個順位抽1抽2抽3之後正常，最後比總血量
**4人**
分兩隊，每人15滴血，起始照順位抽1抽2抽3，順位同隊不會連續
同隊的軍隊不互打，模組跟總部效果彼此會有作用，只是不能控制對方兵

It's like Knizia's Samurai (ie playing out tiles from a limited draw from similar decks) but beefed up to allow attacks between tiles. It's clever - tiles can only hit in some directions (if they have superior initiative) and can get whacked from other directions, so there's constant turnover on the board. But it seems purely tactical and all about making the best of what you get when you get it. I liked it, but not enough to buy.

The first play is tough since you are not sure of the subtleties in the interactions and what mix you have for your selected faction, but still a very cool game. By placing tiles, of armies or bonuses, you try to kill your opponents base. Do not get caught up in board control, you must ensure to kill off the enemies base. I only played at two, but at four you play in teams, which I would also like to try.

Good, quick game which pretty much anyone can pick up and play. If you play like I do, a match will be over in 30-40 minutes. If you need to mull on how to play, this game will easily last you a full hour.

The theme doesn't wow me, and it feels like there is a bit too much luck for such a tactical game.  That said, I really liked the time-based attacks and the asymmetrical balance of powers between different armies.

A clever, well-designed game.  Each game feels different (in part because of the random-ness of tile draws), and, in general, there isn't much collateral damage (that is, even in multi-player, people really only get hit when targeted).  As the game goes on, the leader tends to quickly be targeted, keeping it pretty well balanced.  That said, detecting the endgame and being able to prepare for it is key.

Would like to play more (particularly with 3 players), but I enjoy it more and more each time with 4.  I've had one two-player play, and that's where it is definitely least likely to be naturally balanced.

*Updated* Two-player play is far more chess-like in that experience will (usually) win.  Also, this game is my kryptonite. I have won one two-player game (in a best of 3 showdown…which I lost 1 to 2), but otherwise lost every other match.

Play mostly on the app. Great design, which really makes you feel great when you manage to use Neojungle correctly and get a 20-0 defeat on Smart or Sharrashm but I have a hard time getting 2p games on the table, so it's going to likely remain an app for me.

Such a tight and interesting tactical game.  Build networks of threats upon threats upon counterthreats, then watch it unravel in one cataclysmic battle.  Then build it up again!  Simple yet endlessly recombinable.  Each of the factions has their own dynamic and approach which really give them a personality.  So many options in such a tiny space.  The tile draws can be brutal at times, but that is all part of the game: make the most of what you have.  Always having to discard one tile makes for delicious choices, and the simplicity of either playing, keeping or discarding the other two conceals the depth in this gem.  Wish I could play it over and over again.

It's ugly. Total annoying. Makes you believe there is only tactic and not much luck. In fact, it's all in the draw for that round. You can try to optimize your counter placement, but the next draw (either your's or one of your opponent's) will ruin all your ideas and plans. This judgement is based on only one playing with 3 players. I will not play it again. Only under protest. Oh yes, and it's extremely ugly. IMHO.

The components present the wrong impression of the type of game this is. NH is closer to a CCG (Magic, etc) than a hex based wargame. From the 20 hit points for the HQ's to the tile combos this is a CCG with tiles (similar in many ways to Vortex). Where it excels over the CCG's is the added complexity offered by the 'position' of the units. In Magic, a card played is effective everywhere; it simply targets the opponent. In NH, a unit must be located properly in order to deliver the maximum (or any) damage. This added complexity elevates the game beyond a typical CCG type game. 

The variety of the armies is interesting as each is sufficiently different to require unique strategies. 

Do not become attached to any particular unit as battles are frequent and devastating. It is not unusual to see the board fill and then empty several times during a match. Once players know the rules and the armies, the game last 20-30 minutes which is perfect. 

(I have heard this described as a future history version of Knizia's Samurai with combat...lots and lots of combat.)


This has been a very pleasant surprise.

9 - This is a recent addition and I completely love the game, played it 1 on 1 and 1 on 1  on 1, so far and it's a ton of fun.  in a 3 way game everyone feels like they're getting ganged up on and tries to form treaties.

*****Retrospective*****
6 - I purchased this game about a year and a half ago and it has sat unplayed on my shelf since then.  The problem with the game is it isn't impactful enough to draw repeat plays when you have to do all the bookkeeping on a battle.  Maybe I played the phone version too often, but the battle takes too long to calculate out and deal out lots of damage tokens and that's the entire point of the game.  I love the game, I love the componants, but I feel like the digital version works better because it does the combat for you.  If the hexes were bigger it might be different, but at this point I realize the only reason I haven't traded this game off is because I love the digital version too much to let go.

A neat, fun game, full of strategy and a little luck, with some built in timer mechanisms to keep the game brisk. Area control in tight quarters and asymmetrical play. The mechanics make me think of the sort of brawls you get into in Tactical RPGs, where you're chipping away at their troops, and they at yours, and it just is a bloodbath Worth playing, and worth buying at a reasonable price.

A Chess game of a new age. Easy to learn, hard to master. The current amount of different armies (11) makes the game very different every time. Each army has a specific "way of winning" that you must first learn and turn out to your advantage during the game. Lots of calculation and strategy. One of the games that I can play anytime, anyday.

Avoid killing other players' armies if it's not necessary / doesn't serve your plan - you don't get points for that. Only HQ matters! This is the mistake people usually do at the beginning. 

Absolutely great iOS implementation - probably one of the best iOS games ever made.

Also, board version very nicely priced.

I am not a big fan of sci-fi settings in general, be it in movies, books or games. There are no many sci-fi films I like and those I do like are masterpieces and there cannot be an argument regarding their quality really (Alien, 2001, Star Wars etc.). When it comes to games, the same applies. Neuroshima Hex bears a post-apocalyptic sci-fi / mad max earth setting and despite the good execution and love for detail in creating the theme kit does not do anything for me. The game however is great and I like the mixture of puzzling and drawing luck, because a game without random mechanics usually does not appeal. The different "races" or "factions" are diverse enough to make the game interesting over a long course of time, however, I found that those differences, while they are definitely in place, are not that evident and apparent during gameplay which is a shame because it would have been nice for those subtle difference to have a bigger, observable impact on the game.

Great game... Tile placement, lots of strategy, throw in attacks on other players, add a bit of puzzle-like elements.  This one can get a bit "thinky" or even bring out the AP in some, but still fun.

Also, the two iOS games that have been released are EXCELLENT on iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad.  The base game can be played against an AI opponent(s) or against multiple people passing the handheld back and forth.  The second App is called Neuroshima Hex! Puzzle and it is geared toward solo play.  It really brings out the puzzle element of the games and teaches a lot of strategy and how to use certain tiles correctly.  VERY good.

Great short tactical game. I play it only with 2 players, and in my opinion game is much better this way and i rate it as a 2-player version. Meaningful decisions, easy rules and great replayability are strong parts of Nueroshima Hex. Do you want to concentrate on atacking your opponent's base, defending your own or maybe whipe the board out of enemy troups? You can do whatever you want and there is a lot of possible choices and strategies brought up with many armies and simple, elegant core system. 

Iconography is unintuitive in some cases and with some combinations of armies you need to check with clear rulebooks but other than that it is a flawless 2-player abstract game for me.

Cool idea for a 2-4 player hex-based conflict game.  Slick execution with some interesting possibilities.  This game took longer than advertised, but with experience, that might improve.  Much better (and quicker) as a 2 player game.  Component quality is extremely disappointing.  Balance and luck seem to mar a potentially interesting tactical game.  Rules are often found to be lacking.  Team play is interesting, but still suffers many of the same problems as the 4 player game.

No disappointment here. Great artwork matching the story. Surprised this does not have a higher thematic ranking. I would love to see a Big Box edition, well not for me more to recommend for anyone wanting to get into Hex! I already own it all or almost. And there is the only problem I have. Components and the box seem a little off. There are print runs from two different publishers so they do not match up on thickness or card stock. The box is great however I am unable to stack on it because doing so would warp the board. Lighter than Checkers and most of the time the theme holds it down from feeling as heavy as Chess. Chess timers would be a great ad to this.

It's a very unique game. The flow of turns is a bit clunky feeling to me. Feels like there's a very small amount of choices that can be made each turn and they all depend on the random token draws. There's some decent strategy in a two player match, but four people felt way too chaotic.

Semi abstract with elements of engine-building and warfare. Hexagonal tiles are sequentially drawn and placed by opposing players / teams with an ultimate goal of attacking and destroying the opponent's HQ. Each tile provides unique value, such as long range damage, short range damage, protection, movement/repositioning capabilities, etc. When the board is full or a battle tile is played, warfare commences in "incentive" order, removing hit and destroyed tiles and delivering damage to each HQ. A truly unique game, I've never played anything like it.

Kudos to Michal Oracz and to the playtesters !
Just one remark (Iello French edition) : the compartments for the tiles cannot be covered correctly (by the rulebook or the map, for an example). If the box is tilted, the tiles all get mixed : I shoved the compartments and used ziplock baggies to put the components in them.

This game is a masterpiece in my book. Yet, working out how the battles resolve is so cumbersome that is falls apart to the point of feeling like a brain surgery without anaesthetic.

The process is also very prone to mistakes which is not what you want to hear from a game that requires concentration and careful calculations such as this one.

Better in iOS/Android flavour, where the hard (and error-prone) work is done for you. I would even go as far as to say you should get a tablet and skip the physical game.

Asymmetric armies are squeezed into a confined battle plain until a battle is triggered.  Then a cascade of timing and attacks occur to inflict damage (hopefully on the opposing HQ) and clear out units.  Spiced up by the random draw of one's forces (coupled with a mandatory discard) to make this an interesting tactical game.  The random draw and limited tile options (2 per turn) means that some analysis helps, but not so much that one gets lost in an analytical fog a la chess.

Z-Man version. Started as an 8. 
After several plays, this has become a go-to staple of our group. There is some unpleasant variability in the draws, but it's never been horribly crippling or unduly beneficial. 
Truly, never the same game twice, and it's incredibly fun to play different armies. For those with AP, or prone to overdiscussing options, I highly recommend a 1-minute timer per turn.

Interesting abstract placement game in the guise of a postapocalyptic wargame.  The only chance and hidden information is the order you draw your tiles (like Cave Troll).  Plus you can set up, play, and put it away in less than a half hour.

Not sure about this game. It's got a lot of fun strategy in the game that can fall to hell in just a couple of actions. But watching the action unfold is all part of the fun. It may not go exactly as you planned because you may have overlooked a rather important detail.

I have had fun with this game. Though it's abstract in a sense, the asymmetrical nature of the four factions coupled with the art give this the theme necessary for me to enjoy. As many others have described, it's analogous to a knife fight in phone booth. Normally I enjoy feeling a sentimental attachment to my cardboard troops. In this game that's the wrong feeling to have. Your troops will die quickly and die often. I do think the mechanics operate well enough with the theme and bits create a short narrative experience of gameplay. 

[b]Things I like:[/b]
:d10-1: Asymmetrical factions. Discovering those and utilizing/mitigating them as necessary gives the game a strong lure. Each faction has it's own unique feel.
:d10-2: Artwork and theme. They really help this feel like something more than an abstract.
:d10-3: The gameplay. It feels like it was playtested thoroughly. Each faction has its strengths and weaknesses. 
:d10-4: Quick play time. It's fun and possible to squeeze in more than one in a session.
:d10-5: The sudden eruption of battle when you don't expect it or don't want it. I really like how the battle system works out. It creates some tension.
:d10-6: I like the feel of hurriedly deploying my forces and reacting to the enemy's deployment.

[b]Long live the Outpost![/b]

--Jun2009-- Cool stuff.   After a couple plays, seems like a very tactical short exercise in the vein of _Dungeon Twister_.  It definitely looks like there's a lot of "better play" available if I was to give it more attention.

If you are looking for 40 minutes long 1vs1 typical tactical game, extremely easy to learn and fun to play - this is something for you. And yet - game has much more to offer. There are 10 official armies, another 10 fan-made armies, many other additions, scenarios. Plus, if you like to modify game on your own, community support is superb. You can invent your own army, test it and share with others. A must have for all casual players that would like to have a quick half-an-hour game with friend (or more epic 2vs2 or 3vs3 even variant)

RATING: 3
Not my favourite genre. Players place hexagonal units on a hexagonal board and initiate battles. The aim is to inflict 20 points of damage to enemy's base. With 4 players there are two teams competing and when one base is destroyed the game ends. It's fairly complex even for an experienced player to figure out which things happen simultaneusly and which one after another and what is the final result. Also the game has 75% downtime in the 4 player version unless you you allow checking the next turn's tiles beforehand.

Really great game, one of my favorites. It's extremly replayable deep strategy. Easy to learn hard to master. 

Yeah the tiles drawing is random, but as your stack is drained out you can predict what you can draw. True mastery is when you track your own and your oponent stacks like this. Preparing to what might come and what cannot.

You set up traps and plans within plans. Strategy is really deep and engaging. Its like chess - at first its just straightforward simple game then you learn to employ complex strategies and you discover whole different layer of depth.

Random draft just means that good player will win most of his games but not every game. Then again its the games you loose not the ones you win that matter. If you are loosing you are learning. You stop learning when you win constantly.

My only gripe is that playing with more than 2 players is tedious and some factions become really unbalanced.

Also some add ons (Dancer and Mephisto) are like taken from another game, I dont recomend buying them at all.

Fast, exciting, intense. I find the basic mechanics very clever. These are very abstract, but the theme is well depicted in the art and the differences between the various armies so as to give the game sufficient SF flavour. I couldn't play it for a whole evening as even for me it sometimes seems a bit too luck-driven. However, the mix of armies--bolstered by the expansion--do give it quite a good degree of replayablity. EDIT: Now I've had a chance to play this face-to-face (before I had just been playing on-line), I'm even more convinced that this is a fun game.

RATING: 6.8
Interesting game,i like the mechanism of discarding 1 of the 3 tiles each turn, i think that has some elements of the chess (the ability to see 3-4 moves ahead)but also has some serious problems (in some turns you can't do anything to avoid your defeat and what about the nets? cant rid of them if your opponent close the gaps)

This game feels like a mexican standoff. Gangs/factions deploy their troops and once the fight starts, then everybody shoots. It is awesome. Factions play very differently which is a good thing.

The playing area is tiny yet good. The game is very tense and there is no downtime since you have to pay attention for how other people play.

Very high replayability.

A surprisingly fun abstract strategy game and one shich I did not think I would like from the initial description I had heard.

A tile-laying game in which the tiles frequently break out into battle, destroying one another in complex chain reactions.  The game takes some explaining but is fairly easy to grasp and doesn't take too long to play.  It's pretty different, so I recommend anybody who enjoys tactical combat and/or tile-laying to simply try it if possible.  This works very well as an app; in person, players will really need to focus to make sure they are evaluating the results of battle correctly, based on many initiative and combat numbers on different tiles that can also be modified by other tiles and effects.

Love this game. Although, my impressions were quite the opposite after my first game - I thought that it is extremely luck based and that the tactical side is ratehr poor.

Now, after a lot of games played (mostly app), I am sure that the luck is involved but more important is what and how you are trying to do. Althoug, I think that in case of live players game it is much better 1v1, instead of 4p deathmatch.

I borrowed an I-phone from someone so I could play this game before I bought it. 
After paying against the AI on the app with each army many many times, I fell in love with the game and bought the board game. 
I love this game! 
I really like trying to figure out how to win even with poor tile draws. I feel like this game is all about reacting to your own tile draws (Luck), while also reacting to what your opponent does. 
Awesome game!
Did I mention that I really like this game?

Essen 2007 kiállításon többször is elmentem mellette mivel rajta volt a listámon, csak az a csúnya fényes bevonatú tábla riasztott el. A második kiadásban ezt orvosolták nagy örömömre. A táblán zajló események egy mészárszékre hasonlítanak. Nem szabad hosszú időre tervezned, hanem a pillanatnyi lehetőségeket kell megragadnod. A pálya mérete sem engedi a hosszú időre való tervezést, igazi konfrontatív játékra kényszerít. Alapvetően két személyes, (mi hárman játszottuk, nem ajánlott mert itt tényleg elrontható az egyik játékos játéka) de lehet négyen is játszani, akár csapatban. Minden színű csapatnak más és más egységekből áll a serege. A játék végén az nyer, akinek a bunkere túlélte a csatát vagy a legkevesebb sérülést szenvedte el. Absztrakt játék egy jó témára ráhúzva. Biztos vagyok benne, hogy feljebb fog menni a pontozásom, csak ki kell próbálni páros játékos számmal.

Neuroshima Hex is a fun game, although I found the random tile draws to be frustrating at times. If you draw all of your modules early, and don't get any units, there is nothing you can do. 

I like the variety in the factions, and this improves with expansions. 

The strategy is not always particularly intuitive, and it takes me a few games to get into the rhythm of the game.

There's a really good game hidden in here, which IMO can probably be brought out with some house rules.  The biggest problem is the usual one with random-card-draw games, where runs of extremely useless hands can suck the enjoyment out of the game, but I think that it's addressable.  The game is quite fun when people are drawing well, as it stands.

RATING: 6
Has the optimize-what-you-drew idea of the Carcassonne family, turn-by-turn basis, which I hate. This is mitigated by knowing each other's decks and formulating a long-term plan based on what is yet to come up, but therein lies the dilemma: I think learning the decks would just create frustration that your tiles didn't come up in the order you want, or your opponent just happened to draw it at the right time. A game like Summoner Wars isn't trivial with what you drew, so it's fun to think about your turn even when you don't know the decks and what's on deck.

Reminiscent of Samurai, which has own (symmetric) decks, but has hand management.

Might grow on me.

-Excellent 2 player asymmetrical game

-Low complexity/High depth
-Heavy tactics for short game
-Great army variety (with many expansions)
-Short game that doesn't feel like filler
-Light theme serves mechanics very well

Cons:
-Poor rule book (Improved for Ver 3.0)
-Okay with 3 players, not recommended with 4
-Luck of the draw can make for a uneven game (though this is rarer than many games with drawing mechanics)

Misc:
-Short setup/take down time

RATING: 7
A brilliant and innovative game.  The tactical depth is surprising, and every game plays out differently.  The 4 armies (I'm speaking of the base set only here) require use of different strategies.  The only negatives I have noticed:

1.  The armies are not *completely* balanced.  The Outpost, in particular, are weakest and most difficult to play effectively.  However, this can be fixed by giving them Mercenary units and possibly a couple house-rules.
2.  Bad draws (esp. in the early game) can make your life very difficult and sometimes, impossible to win a particular match.  

However - I wouldn't sacrifice the use of different (asymmetrical) armies and randomness since these elements add so much re-playability to the game.  

Update (5/20/14): I hardly play this anymore, and while I still respect the game, it doesn't hold the same appeal to me that it once did.  Downgrading to a 7.

2008: 8. I've really grown to love this quick-play tactics game, but unfortunately have not been able to convince many in my gaming group to play it with me much.  Must try harder, as there's a gem of a game here.

2013 UPDATE: 9. Brought the game and its expansions to a board game day with another circle of friends and the game was a huge hit amongst all who played it!  Several had never heard of it before and two said they were going to go out and buy it right away. I still see some issues teaching non-gamers this game, but if you have friends who are already familiar with different "armies" and units in a game, then they'll get this easily.

2016: UPDATE: 10. Been playing more PvP on iPhone and I'm upgrading again. The asymmetric nature of the armies and absence of CCG/"deck building" mechanics is something I'm really enjoying. There's an element of mastery, learning the match ups and how to "pilot" a faction in different situations. And yet the armies are not too difficult to learn and games play quick. Still continue to be impressed after this game years after.

Clever tactical tile-placement game. Players draw three, discard 1 tile each turn, and places tiles on hex board. Tiles have different attack and defensive abilities. There are also tiles that grant bonuses etc. The object is to place tiles in such a way to 'hit' and deal damage to the enemy base. When all tiles have been played, the player that deals the most damage wins.

Gameplay is easy and the game doesn't get overbearing. However, it suffers from one of my gaming pet peeves...the over-reliance on iconography. All the tiles have symbols that require a reference sheet to decipher. With four different armies, that's alot of referring. Ugh. Really grinds the game down.

This game has simple (when in English) rules and plays pretty quickly, but it's so easy to miss something and get yourself annihilated.  It has a lot of puzzle elements, which I like, but the theme doesn't do much for me at all.

Abstract, Skirmish. Nice little "themed" abstract. The different factions and multiplayer ability add a little spice. Not complicated and plays pretty smoothly. Would be great as a computerized game.

And yes, the iOS version is great. Ended up trading this once our plays dropped off.

Egyedi mechanizmussal rendelkező hatszögrendszerű játék, négy különböző egységekkel rendelkező fajjal, magas újrajátszhatósági faktorral. Negatívumának hozzák fel, hogy a négy faj különböző erősségű, de az eddig játékomban éppen a legerősebbnek mondott faj lett az utolsó és a második leggyengébb győzött. Az igazi negatívum csak annyi, hogy a játékosok 4 letehető lapból gazdálkodnak csak, ami miatt a szerencsének meghatározó lehet a szerepe, amit több lap kézben tartásával azért lehet módosítani.

[2011-08-06]
Főleg kétszemélyes játéknak tartják, sokan hárman nem is ajánlják, de az eddigi tapasztalataim mindig rácáfoltak erre. Én bátran ajánlom 3-4-en is a játékot, jó játékosokkal tökéletesen működik így is.

[2011-08-13]
Azt kell mondanom a fajok kiegyenlítettségében én nem találok hibát. Mindegyik faj győzelemre vezethető jó játékosok kezében. Ahogy korábban írtam a lapok húzásában megjelenik a szerencse, sőt lényegesnek is mondható, de úgy érzem ez jó játékosok esetén van idő a kompenzációra bőven.

RATING: 7
unique little tactical battle game. Cool asymmetrical armies. I like it, but don't love it.

Both players set up the board for the next battle, and when it comes, it comes by surprise. Deterministic combat makes it pretty objective who wants to fight and who does not, but with the predictable tiles mixed with the random drawing there's a bit of drama and tension as you scramble to set up an offense, defense, a special ability tile, or a battle tile before the next battle happens.

When the board gets complicated, keeping track of who will benefit more from a battle can be pretty tedious, and it's hard to keep a running total of things because of the tactical nature of the game.

RATING: 5.5
I'm hard pressed to call this a wargame.  This feels much more like a Knizia tile laying game.  Everything feels static, where movement, unless it comes naturally to a piece, is almost always the clear discard. The pieces, despite the art, feel abstract, in fact the whole game feels like a mathy laser puzzle.  

I feel that I might like the game more if you kept the action tiles separate where you could draw from either actions or units if you'd like this would encourage pushing for actions, or now having your actions wasted when you have no pieces on the board.  
 
All in all this game is too dependent on drawlogy for me to want to play it again.  I respect the design, but it just doesn't feel finished yet.

The game also suffers from the whole, why should I attack the leader when you are only attacking me syndrome.

Light Speed is similar enough, has just as much game, has more control, is more intense, has a sense of motion, and is done in 5 minutes. Why play this in comparison?

There's something about this game that draws me in, and I don't typically like Chess-like games.  However, it appears to have one major flaw... landslide victory.  If, after the first major battle, your opponent loses most of his units, you might as well stop playing the game.  There's little chance of recovery.

RATING: 7
I thought this game was pretty good with 2 people, but with 4 people it came alive!  It's always a tough decision when choosing which tile to discard (you must discard one from your hand each turn). 

The units and modules are fun to use and find combinations for.  Some counting comes into play as well as you make decisions on whether to discard a certain tile because you always know exactly how many you have left in your deck (if any!) If you discard it now you'll never get another chance to play it!

I'm torn by this game. It's a flavorful abstract (if that makes sense). Each army has its own thematic characteristics, its plusses and minuses. Each turn is a puzzle to be solved. I like that puzzly flavor. On the downside, the game is very random. You're stuck without whatever you draw and sometimes you just draw awful. In the long run a good player will win more games than a so-so player but the short run can be very frustrating. Also, "solving" battles can be very tricky. It's quite likely you will make mistakes, or even that you and your opponent will both miss something that would have changed what happens. Purely as a game it works better on the iPad for that reason (the computer does all that battle solving). Of course, if you do both get some battle results wrong you'll never know.

It brought alot of personality to the game and the descriptions in the rule book made it feel like their was a larger story going on. Can't wait to try the 2 player version.

iPhone play only, against computer.

An abstract game, really, but with a theme that makes it feel a bit less so. It works pretty well, and I imagine it would be pretty tense in real life (esp with more 3-4 players, since the board size does NOT increase). Need to try it against a person!

4 different armies are available. These are mostly pieces (all hex tiles) that attack in 1-6 directions, adjacent and/or ranged, for 1-3 damage. They also have initiative 0-3, and possibly bonus HP (most units die after 1 hit). In addition, there is a headquarters (20 hit points; you're eliminated if it gets down to 0), modules that give some adjacent hexes bonuses or penalties, and several single-use action tiles (move tiles, attack hex adjacent to HQ, drop bomb on hex and hit it and adjacent hexes, and push a tile into an adjacent empty space). Each army has a different configuration, and will need to be played differently.

First few turns, just place your HQ. During game, draw to hand size 3, then discard 1 from game; either play, discard or keep the other two. Battles ONLY occur when you play a Battle tile, as well as a final battle at the end of the game. Battles are in descending initiative order (so low-initiative units may be killed and removed before they ever get to attack). 

The game end is triggered when a player runs out of tiles; the others get one last turn, then the final battle occurs. The player with most HP left on their HQ wins.

This is a neat little battle game played with hexagonal tiles.  I really like the spacial element of the game as each tile does certain things in only certain directions.

However, there are many other 2-player battle games out there and this one feels more empty than those better options.  It actually feels pretty theme-less, more like just putting tiles down on a board and facing the numbers the right way which starts to trend dangerously toward abstract territory for me.

RATING: 9
An asymmetric tactical combat-oriented tile laying game, with multiple armies vying after a very small plot of land.  Theme galore as well, drawing on the Neuroshima RPG universe.  The art is just amazing in the 3rd edition.

While it is not uniquely better than any of the pure games of a certain genre (eg, it does not beat games like El Grande for area control) the fact that it meshes all those element together so seamlessly is what makes this special.  While there are some complaints about it being "fiddly" the rules are nowhere near as complex as a wargame, and can be easily explained.

This game also ranks high for me, because the theme comes through in a very strong way.  Also, what you are doing makes sense game wise.  You can develop a narrative. You feel like you are there, in the trenches of this post apocalyptic wasteland

I think there is a nice combat game here, however it has one major drawback.  The drawing of the tiles randomly can seriously hamstring you if you keep drawing action tiles that don't allow you to attack or defend very well while your opponents whittle you away.  I won my first play and didn't feel I earned it at all.  My two opponents semi-ganged up on me at first and after they had taken me down quite a bit went after each other.  One took the other out but doing so then weakened him to the point that he was easy for me to knock off without really doing much.

It's decent and I do enjoy it, but not nearly as much as I hoped I would.  The small playing field is really deceptive.  It requires good tactical thought, but the overall game is too simple to be enjoyable after a few goes.  I might consider adding an expansion to it to see if that helps beef up the complexity.  As it stands, I've won all 4 of the games I've played and have not too much interest in playing again.

An excellent tactical battle game that plays quickly and delivers incredible bang for the buck. I particularly like asymmetric games, and Neuroshima Hex shines in that regard. The units don't just differ slightly; the four armies provided each have a unique feel and require different approaches to be successful.

Combat is resolved deterministically, but the order in which tiles are drawn introduces a random element that players must contend with. Some draws will be no-brainers in terms of what to discard and what to play, but I've yet to see a full game that didn't provide numerous tough decisions.

It's probably not really fair to rate this game after a single 2-player game, since it seems like the type of game whose rating would go up with more plays and an increased familiarity with the various components, but I'm not always a fair person!  So anyhow, THIS is my type of tile-laying game!!  You've got melee attacks, ranged attacks, grenade attacks, sniper attacks... all sorts of attacks, really!  Mind you, as a result of all that attacking, the tiles that come into play don't often remain in play for very long, which might take some getting used to for those of us who are accustomed to other tile-laying games.  But I absolutely love that each army is a completely unique play experience with various strengths and weaknesses.  And there are no farmers in this game - the players only have to worry about the likes of Butchers, Hunter-Killers, Annihilators, and Gladiators, none of whom are as sneaky as farmers!  It's a cool game, but I do have some gripes about the physical components.  First of all, the theme doesn't grab me at all and I find the artwork to be rather cheesy, but that's purely personal preference.  Secondly, when you buy this game, you are paying for a lot of Chinese air - the game box should have been about 1/4 of it's current size.  Thirdly, I find the rulebook to be nearly unreadable (even with my reading glasses on!) due to small font on a dark background.  And finally, if they're going to have such a big box, they should have at least made the rest of the components larger so that players can tell at a glance what the board situation is without having to hover over it too closely.  But that griping aside, it's a fun, light, quick-playing game that I'm looking forward to trying with 3 and 4 players to see how that changes the play experience.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 6/10

I've never played anything else quite like it -- a vicious, tactical tile-placement game (wargame?) with very different factions and a lot of replayability.

The biggest problem with it is that tile draws are random and poor luck can be the deciding factor.

After several hundred games online and against the iOS version I finally played the physical boardgame. It's slightly less successful there because managing tokens and resolving battles is rather more fiddly without a computer to it for you.

Played one four-player two vs two team match and immediately the whole group saw the potential of this game. A lot of strategical tile placement involved.

One minus comes from quality of the components, it's not FFG or DOW level.

In un mondo devastato dall’ottusità del genere umano, micidiali eserciti si fronteggiano in desolate lande adatte ormai solo ad ospitare desolati campi di battaglia. Indomiti ufficiali senza scrupoli schierano i propri soldati sul campo. Silenziosamente, come una marea oscura, finalmente le unità muovono i primi passi tra le macerie e i crateri di un mondo nuovo. I cecchini, chini sulle loro armi, attendono, trattenendo il respiro, le prime avvisaglie dello scontro. Pericolose come squali in cerca di una preda si radunano le macchine. Bande di cacciatori induriti dalla desolazione, stringono le fila, stretti alle loro lame, nascosti tra le rovine delle città ormai ridotte in cenere...

Couldn't quite get away from this one which was lurking on my wish list for a while, but picked it up at Leisure Games on a browsing session, and boy am I glad I did.
Knife fight in a phone box is the perfect description for this game. It's punchy, agressive fun, but without ever feeling too chess-like. Renders games like Hive obsolete. Own it, love it, want more of it.

All in all, a game I never get tired of playing, and regret being unable to play as much as I'd like to.

war game  condensado, mas muito tatico ,em que tentamos levar a base do nosso adversario a zero, alguma experiencia necessaria para se conseguir jogar bem, raça vermelha um pouco desnivelada das outras....Mecanica curiosa ,de retirar 3 tropas e escolher 2 para se colocar no tabuleiro.
A guerra irá acontecer quando o pequeno tabuleiro ficar cheio ou alguem escolher o tile da guerra. Jogo que implica treino, dado a colocação correcta das tropas e o conhecimento das mesmas não ser muito indutivo. Quando dominado , viciante!

I 'own' this game, but only my iPhone. My rating is based on games vs. the AI and not other players.

Update: I've now played it once as a 5 player game and twice as a 2 player game.

The player elimination kinda sucks, but it was much less complicated to calculate initiative etc than I thought it would be.

I've played this ALOT on the iPhone and am increasingly of the opinion that the starting tiles can decide the game. Get bad tiles and you can be 10 hit points down by turn 2. Get good tiles and you can turtle your base or set the whole game up too easily.

Rating down from a 7 to a 5.8.

Finally got to play this.  The game is actually very fun.  But, the random tile drawing has somewhat ruined each game I've played so far.  It would be nice if a new mechanic was created to mitigate the randomness a bit.

Regardless of that fault, I really liked playing this.

RATING: 7
This is a very good game that I enjoyed a bunch more than I thought I would at first glance.  I'm a little hesitant of games which have so many different factions as they can be imbalanced, and only more play would let me figure out whether or not that was actually the case.

But the interaction of the pieces, and the tough tough decisions that you have to make on which pieces to play, where to play them, and which way to orient them make for some really nice options always available to you and things you can do.

RATING: 7
A decent little game.  Conflict oriented games are not my game of preference but I found myself not minding this one due to how short it was.  The random draws of the tiles could certainly swing things one direction or the other, and I believe king making is certainly possible in this game.  Still fun to play however.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For 3 players this game is bad (atack the leader), for 4 the board is too small, team variant is ok, but there`re much better games for 4 players. But for 2 players Neuroshima Hex is great.

Very often you want use all three tiles and it`s not always easy to choose wchich one do you discard. Interesting is: i hit him for 3, he hit me this unit, but in phase 2, so i hit him first in phase 3 and so on. Maybe during the first it seems to complicated for such fast and easy game, but after few plays it`s not so hard.

The game is very tactical, but you will play better when you know the armys. Nice that every army is diferent. But you will see the character of outpost only in the 2 player game.

Sometimes you draw only bad tiles and you can only loose, but usually the game is very interesting. After the battle the boards usually clears and you start from the beginning. So the game is very dynamic.

The King of the hill (second side of the first edition board): not so good. You must put tiles on the hill, also when you don`t need it - your oponnent wouldn`t have a adventage. So you don`t have so much choices like in the standard game. With Borgo this variant is broken! Borgo has a very high initiative and with the bonuses from the hill they are unbeatable.

I don't like the fantasy theme, neither rpg, but otherwise the game is truly great. Well-balanced armies, needs thinking, but it doesn't suffer the decision-paralysis. Surely the best Polish game ever, but it's also great comparing to some Western projects.

After playing so much on the iPod, I'm feeling a little burned out on the game.  It is a fantastic tactical game;  each turn is its own puzzle that gives you multiple options.  The game isn't about grand gestures, but often about nickle and diming your opponent to death.  I prefer the post-apocalyptic theme to something like sci-fi, and it's not as common as generic fantasy.

One big gripe is that you can find yourself in a position where you know one player will win because it's impossible to get board control over them.

RATING: 8.4
This game pushes all the right buttons for me. I'm not even sure what to compare it to, but the whole strategically setting up your pieces for a potential battle where all attacks trigger at once, not sure why but that makes for a really fun abstract. I, like many others, feel Neuroshima Hex! lends itself to app play, as there is almost like this extra player, ie the 'computer', which resolves the battles and reminds you how much of an idiot you are when you forget to see that 4 on your opponent's sniper at the back of his base. And yeah, it can get complex. You really need to pay attention to the interactions of all the pieces, like any good abstract. 

I'm not a big fan of more than two players, as it just devolves into this chaotic mess, but as a two player strategy game? Wow.

This game became a standard for high-quality abstract strategy games for me. It's highly playable in various number of palyers including solving puzzles in a solo play. Theme and artwork (while not that important for the gameplay) fits nicely and armies are very different in feel and way of how to play them. Combinations are almost limitless and overall this one shouldn't be missing in anyone's gaming library if he likes abstract strategies.

RATING: 9
Amazing mechanic. Great theme (albeit completely pasted on and can be easily rethemed with no fun lost)
For me this has the same elements of problem solving like Hive, but the randomness brings just so much to the table. 
You may loose due to bad draw, but when you win with drawing poorly, it's that much more satisfying. 
Plus you can convince people who are not that much tactically thinking to play because of the luck element, so they may just win.

RATING: 8.5
Might just very well slip into the top 10 of my favorite games.  I cannot seem to win, but I think that the game is tremendous.  Basically an abstract, which is shocking to me, because I have very little interest in abstracts (see: Attika), it can be decided at times by the draw of the tiles.  The game is designed so that you feel so pinched at nearly all times--there is just no way to really bust out and lay waste to the enemy most of the time.  

The theme is very interesting (post-apocalyptic warfare), the bits are very well done (though many of my tiles have slipped printing), and the artwork is incredible.  It is one of the most interesting looking games that I have seen.  Outside of those, the gameplay is smooth, quick, fighting is frequent and bloody, and the replayability is immense.  

Highly recommended after a half dozen plays.

RATING: 6.75
Asymmetrical battle game on a tight playing field.  Player elimination in 3- or 4-player games is a letdown, as are highly unlikely tile pulls (particularly when your attacks are bunched up early).  Two-player games remove the elimination issue, but there may be some questions of balance between different forces.  More plays should give better insight.

Playing this too much in too short a time (9 plays in 3 weeks) may have soured me on this, but I may get back into it.

This has seen more play than any other game I own. With the right opponents, it's fast moving and feels like a combination of puzzle, card game, and war game. With the wrong person, though, you could end up spending half an hour waiting for that person to figure out their turn.

My advice is to gang up on people like that to knock them out of the game early, and to never agree to one-on-one games with them.

Played this at the Z-Man booth at Cancon/AGE 2010. Involves a lot of positioning and tile placement before a battle token is played and chaos reigns supreme. Can be quite brain burning, and at times, way too random due to the battle units vs support units in the tile draw. Works much better 2 player than 4 player. A lot of fun, and I would definitely consider purchasing this in the future.

**UPDATE** 

I have purchased NH and find it to be a quick, fun, filler that shines when played 1 on 1. Quite random and highly tactical.

Great little game of tactics with a bit of luck thrown in there.  Played only once as a 2 player but I like it a lot.  Might be a bit of an AP prone game so choosing who you play with could be important.  I love the "throw one of your three hexes away" sometimes you want all 3 of them so badly.  Can't wait to give this a go again.

Fantastic fast-paced 2-player game. Cool tactical decisions. You can play it really off-the-cuff or take your time figuring out optimal positions for combat and still have a good experience. The battle system is cool, although with a busy battlefield it sometimes takes a little while to fully run through the battle in your head. With a little practice, this gets easier. Also, as tactical as the game is, there's still room for wider strategy.

They did a great job at giving the armies a different flavor. Borgo is always right up in your face, often with a lot of suicide attacks at the opponent's HQ (unless a Net Fighter is safely tucked at the HQ as well, then it's beatin' time). Moloch fights from afar, building a bunker and pushing people away for a safe buffer. Outpost is tough to predict due to its high mobility, and Hegemony dabbles in several things. Things like this make it very replayable.

The expansion armies are very neat too, but what brings this to an even further level is the Duel board. Highly recommended after a couple plays.

This is a fantastic tactical combat game.  Since the units that become available are random, this game rewards short-term tactics over long-term strategy, which is refreshing.  It's all about action and reaction until someone starts the battle, and half the field is wiped out.  Each army has unique and interesting units and feels significantly different from the others, so there is a good amount of replayability here as well.

The crux is placement of hex-army tokens on a small hex map in particular orientation, defending each player's headquarters.  Armies are different for each player, and drawn randomly.  After the board fills up or a player chooses to play a battle token, all hell breaks loose in a predetermined order based on the turn order hierarchy on each army tile.  There is a complexity of combat effects. Really fun and interesting. I also have the iPhone version which plays great!

Purchased from Mind Games, Melbourne, Australia.

I love this game. It's got a certain quality that makes it instantly recognizable as a great game. I have played games that grow on you, and I get that, but it's nice to have games like this, that grab you from the moment you play your first tile. 

It has been compared to Hive. I can see why, but I feel that the comparison can be misleading, as this game somehow manages to capture the feel of a combat game. It has some (perhaps a lot) of the feel of a tactical miniatures game. It doesn't hurt that the units capture the imagination. 

Fantastic game!

Neueroshima Hex is a tremendous innovation in board games, it's a real breath of fresh air in an industry that often churns out imitation after imitation.  It's a game of strategic placement with a combat theme - and the armies, while well balanced - are completely asymmetrical.  Games are tight and bloody, and while it's possible that a game could possibly drag down into slow paralysis with overly analytical folks - the game really feels like it moves at a quick clip.

RATING: 9
Pros:
+Strong and unique mechanics
+Quick asymmetric game
+Love the initiative system
+Lots of factions available through expansions, deep options out there

Cons:
-Some will be bothered by the 'calculations' (not mathematical) in each battle to determine who attacks who and when.  I like this, some don't. 
-Luck factor is a bit high in the tiles you choose.  The better play will still win more on average, and the games are relatively short, but bad draws can really cripple you at the wrong time. 

I really enjoy Neuroshima Hex!  It's a great 2-player option, unique from most other games, plays quick but deep, and I love asymmetric games with many factions available.  Really good and fun game that will get a lot of mileage, especially with inexpensive expansions.

RATING: 7
Initial rating 8. This game is so much better than I could ever imagine. I never though that a game played on 19 hexes can have so much tactics and fun in it. One of the best games I'v played so far. Plays well both with 2, 3 and four players, is relatively short but still gives a complete satisfaction.
edit: after some additional plays it seems that there is quite an annoying luck factor involved. As the game is otherwise very balanced, one unlucky draw of tiles (usually too many instant actions) can put you in a hole you'll not crawl out. -1 for that.

Fantastic game! I prefer playing with variant where you're allowed to draw up to 5 tiles instead of just 3. When you draw 5 tiles,  you put 2 back, discard 1 and keep the remaining 2.

Working out combat isn't particularly difficult, just need to grab a few extra coloured tokens and just note down which units have acted! The ios does have it charms though, working out combat for you, the fact that I can play it at any time of the day or night. Learning all the different factions is really fun.

Best played quickly, this isn't the kind of game where you want things to drag.

Very clever tile-laying game that plays exceptionally well with three players. Good combination of random elements and planning balancing luck and skill. Has a strong theme of post-apocalyptic gang warfare well adapted to mechanics. Balance between playable gangs is not absolute but that is also part of the fun. We use combined hit points (30 per team) for the four player game to prevent ganking, otherwise splendid as it is. Very strongly recommended.

It's like [gameid=3], the collectible card game!  Each of the armies in the game is a little different, and each has their strengths and weaknesses.  I have a soft spot for variable player powers, and this game does them very well.  The iconography takes a little bit to get the hang of, but by the end of the first game, I felt very comfortable with how battles would work.  The map is very claustrophobic.  I have only played this two-player, and was surprised at how much I like it.  In fact, like Samurai, I think it might be better with two, or a maximum of three players.  Any more and the chaos can quickly spiral out of control.

A quick 2-player game with a lot of maddening decisions. Play is similar to Samurai (which I've only played once or twice a while ago). Draw 3, discard 1 and play (or hold) the other two. Open fire when most advantagous to you and hopefully damage your opponents base more than they damage yours for the win. We played 2 games using all the factions that the game comes with; Robots beat humans and the scum beat the mutants. I'm looking forward to more of this.

Neuroshima Hex is a strategy game placed in a post-apocalyptic world of Neuroshima (a Polish RPG). Each player leads one of four armies: Borgo, Hegemonia (Hegemony), Moloch and Posterunek (Outpost). Each army deck consists of 34 tiles - soldiers, support tiles and special actions. You win when you destroy all enemy H.Q. or your H.Q. is the least damaged one at the end. A second edition of the game was released at Essen 2007 with updated graphics and a new, larger board. A special Essen pack sold there also included the Neuroshima Hex! - Doomsday Machine fifth army expansion. Expanded By: Neuroshima Hex! - Mad Bomber, Neuroshima Hex! - Doomsday Machine

The strategic learning curve on this is pretty steep, since each army plays in a completely unique manner. The iconography isn't all that clear either, at least for someone who doesn't play on fairly regular basis. Those are my only (not to mention very minor) complaints, it does a nice job of putting an interesting wargame skin on what is really just an abstract tile laying game. Neuroshima Hex! is honestly one of the best games of this type I have played. It reminds me of Hive, but with much more chrome and complexity (in a good way). The ios/android app is also very good, but do yourself a favor and get a hard copy to learn on. The player aids in the box are well worth it when you are learning the game.

One of the most fruitful creative areas in game design lately seems to be taking two disjoint genres and merging them into a quirky and awesome game.  Video game designers, especially, have been exploring this concept (see: Puzzle Quest and Henry Hatsworth).  This is the idea behind Neuroshima Hex.  It's half tile-laying game, half fighty game.  Both halves are simple by their respective genres' standards, but together they are so much greater than the sum of these parts.

The coolest aspect is that each army is unique and plays completely differently--I love asymmetry in my games, especially confrontational ones.  The whole module/unit/action tile division allows a lot of flexibility in army design.  The subsequent expansions and fan armies offer wildly different experiences.

Just a fantastic game.  One of my all-time favorites.

Super fantastic game.  The strategy behind this game is phenomenal.  I love the build up to the gunfight.

Decided to rate this so that people would have something other than shill ratings to look at.  Received for Christmas, and it is quite good.  The four factions all play differently.  Rulebook is a bit hard to navigate at times, but use of the F-bomb in the flavor text is a plus.  Plays very quickly, but beware of AP-prone players, they might make this game a bit of a chore.  Good euro (tile laying, reminds me of Attika) mechanics with violence and carnage.  Likely very fun with 4 playing as a team.  Played several times with 2 and it was a lot of fun.

My "breakthrough game" - Neuroshima Hex! got me into modern boardgaming and if it wasn't for this game I probably wouldn't be into this hobby at all.  

It used to be my #1 top rated game for years, but right now it was slightly overshadowed by a few other games in my collection (I'm probably a bit burnt out on it after so many plays) . I still love playing it though, it's a brilliant, timeless design and it will foverer hold the honorable spot on my shelf. Sure, there's luck in the tile draw, but it doesn't really matter in the long run - the better player will win most of the time. The amount of fun and replayability packed into this one box is simply astonishing. 

[b]/update, February 2018:[/b] "Objectivelly speaking" it's a 10, I've downgraded it to a 9 just because I'm a little burnt out on it after countless app plays.

RATING: 7
This is totally a cheat. I’ve played this before, but this is the first time I’ve ever played against someone. Also, we played using the iOS version of this game, mostly because my opponent lives all the way across the continent. Still, I think it qualifies as “not played before” and I log all of my online and iOS games when I’m playing against someone I know.

Now, about the game. It’s a thematic abstract game where you place tiles and try to destroy your opponent’s base. The tiles you place (I’ll call them army tiles since they look like soldiers) typically have damage on them that either damages tiles that are right next to it or in the same row depending on the attack type. The army tiles sometimes have other abilities like shields (to prevent ranged damage), nets (to prevent other tiles from attacking), extra life, the ability to move later, or other abilities (depending on the army). There are also tiles that let you move your tiles, your opponents tiles, attack a specific unit, a few few units, and start battles.

Battles are where everything goes down. Each of those army tiles has an initiative between 3 and 0. Starting at initiative 3 and all the way down to 0 (usually just the bases), every tile will attack. Any tiles destroyed are removed from the game. Those battles are started either with a battle tile or when the board is completely full.

In addition, there are multiple armies that all work roughly the same but have different wrinkles. One army might be more mobile, or have more armor, or use more nets than the other.

So we have a thematic game that functions a lot like an abstract game. There are lots of interesting mechanics and asymmetric factions. It can play anywhere from two to four, but most call it a two player game. There are additional factions available for purchase and the game is on it’s 3rd (or 4th) incarnation. You can play it cheaply on iOS or Android. That’s a lot of strengths.

Yet, I’m a little lukewarm on all of the factions. Some of them are just downright confusing and while the interface has a way to look up the different powers of each tile, it’s not as slick as other games. That being said, you can ignore most of the factions and happily stick to the four the game comes with, buying the additional ones later. That would be my recommendation.

This game is at least worth a purchase if you own an iPad, iPhone, or Android device. It’s a quick game that has some pretty interesting decisions to be made. I’m considering buying the physical edition because I like this one so much.

Post-apocalyptic sci-fi, hex tile placement, strategy game on a city ruin board map. Somewhat abstract puzzle with interactive battling. Has unique game play elements to me. No cards. Strategically place and face your units and time placement of special effect tiles.  Factions have different characteristics that play differently. Best part of the game is the bluff and counter and how it encourages tenuous negotiations between players.  Has a generous amount of iconology to get through.

I have played this over 800 times, and I still enjoy it.  I enjoy playing it online because of the turn timers and not having to bother with shuffling.  The game is quite balanced and, despite the randomness, the more skilled player will win much more often than not.

Wow, I didn't expect that. I think it's one of the very few Polish games that are actually popular outside of Poland. And man, am I not surprised: this game, being quite easy to learn, can be very complicated. This is pure tactics, and the theme is damn awesome. Different factions have different approaches to the game, and I find mechanics very much connected to their backgrounds. There's not that much luck involved, so if you're more strategy-oriented, don't even think - just buy this awesome game.
Well, the components could be something better than simple hexagonal cardboards, but they're good enough for me.

I only play it on my Android phone (save so much time). It is my default game that I play when I have some time to kill. It is simple but still has enought strategy into it. The randomness of the draw can make you win or lose pretty fast, but a game on my Android last less than 10 minutes, so it is not a big deal.

I played and loved the computer game!  I couldn't wait to get this one.  When I got the real board game, I was a little disappointed at the much slower pace as I taught people and as we played a lot of group games, but maybe now it will pick up.

Nice light wargame. You only have 2 of 3 units available to add to the board each turn. You have to discard 1 each turn so it is challenging. Lots of interesting decisions. Will take several games to appreciate the different races.

I have a problem with this game.

3. You really need to dig deep to get the most out of it.

Fun tile placing game that has extraordinary strategy all packed in a seven inch battlezone. There is more room for the expansions and for more players but its interesting fighting on such a small area! When the board is full then all the shooting goes down (we call this the toaster effect, with regard to the bathroom scene from Pulp Fiction). Wonderful game and lots of teams with different strategies make the replay value of this game quite high!

We almost always play this with a timer with 1-minute turns to make a game that could be a plodding, abstract brain burner into a frantic tactical free-for-all. The rules are a bit fiddly in places and the rulebook could have done a better job explaining the edge cases, but it is a fairly light game that lends itself to repeated playings.

Excellent game, good strategy... actually reminds me a little of that game they played in the Millenium Falcon on Star Wars but with armies and units.  Surprisingly close quarters game map where there may be 2-3-4 moves jockeying for position before a battle and then it's carnage! Comes with a good array of armies to start with.  I don't have any of the expansion pack armies, but might buy one or two.

Bookshelf Games' video review made me buy this, and I don't regret it.

I really enjoy the Neuroshima setting of Portal Publishing. The post-apocalypse has appealed to me since I was a teenager (blame Mad Max, Car Wars, and the Swedish RPG Mutant). While the theme in Neuroshima Hex! isn't that deep, and gameplay is reminiscent of a great abstract it still clicks and works well in practice.

Running a multi-player league of this in an evening should be a lot of fun.

I'm pretty sure we missed a lot of the rules in our first attempt at Neuroshima Hex since we were pressed for time.  Our explainer gave us a very brief overview of the mechanics but did not went into details of what each symbol represented, the order of conflict resolution, as well as how units affected one another.  So my initial impression was a game very reminiscent of MTG, albeit simpler and less cleanly designed (tiles just don't look as good as cards, nor carry as much information).  It also felt somewhat chaotic, random, and especially unbalanced for 3 players, since the third player can just hold back and watch the other two destroy each other.

I think Neuroshima Hex has potential and I would definitely want to try it again with a full understanding of the gameplay elements.

I feel very mixed up about this one. There’s a lot going on, while you’re playing. There’s a pretty important amount of luck involved in this game, because you have to draw tiles blindly. In one turn, you could draw three almost, at that moment, useless tiles. While in the next turn, you draw three tiles which you want to play all. The theme of the game isn’t that great to me. Personally I prefer a theme which shows some more history (WWII, Spanish War, Roman war), but that doesn’t change the gameplay. The gameplay is different from other wargames I’ve played before. No dice included for fighting. To destroy an enemies unit, you just have to do one thing. Hit it (or maybe hit it two times, if the unit has gain an extra protection). That’s it. And still it is very tactical. Every unit you place, you should think about how it would be rotated onto the board, because that could make a huge difference. Played this game with 4 players, but I think it might work better with just two players.

While I was playing this one, I was feeling like I was in the middle of a computer game instead of a boardgame. Could work nice on a tablet.

The player boards are thick and sturdy, even the art looks better. And personal health trackers aren't necessary, but they look great and fit in really well.

The fifth army, Doomsday Machine, looks like a complete powerhouse, and I cannot wait to see it in action.

This is a great combat game. The asymmetrical teams add replay value, and the random unit draws force players to adapt their tactics.

With 4 players, the metagame can really shine through as well. The board gets so tight that players need to make deals (at least temporarily) to get what they really need.

This is not a game that I would play if I wanted a strategic matchup, however. There is too much randomness to have any major control.

Короткий скирмиш со странной механикой - юниты практически неподвижны и "активируются" несколько раз за игру. Смесь абстрактной игры и варгейма. Короткие партию возносят её на высоту. Но уникальная механика сама по себе (в отрыве от даваемого преимущества по времени) мене не очень нравится. Расы не сбалансированы, рандом чуть выше, чем хотелось бы.

Highly tactical game that looks abstract but feels like a post-apocalyptic brawl over a spit of land. The different factions are cool and allow variety, though you're likely to play the same one many times in order to get to know them/identify with them (can't say that about an abstract game).

The expansions, Babel13 and Duel, add plenty of fun in the armies alone, while also providing variations to the basic system that can be tried out to mess around a bit.

Own all the expansions.

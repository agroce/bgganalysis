A few years back the Goldsieber stable got a sudden injection of high quality wooden abstract games when it simultaneously released this alongside "Cabale" and "Caprice". This is the only one that still comes to the table and it certainly has matured well.

p: I really love this one. And not just because it is made of wood and feels great to play. To me the beauty lies in the clever use of three basic elements that have their own inner logic (a sun across a rooftop creates a shadow, a shadow cannot sit next to a sun as it needs a roof to be able to exist, etc), making it a far cleverer game than facing a game with arbitrary rules for 3 abstract types of pieces. It is what sets it apart from the usual abstract fare. That the entire game including the board are made of wood is a rewarding bonus.

I feel this is best played with more adventurous players, as cautious play does indeed create a plodding game that generates long diagonal rows of suns roofs and shadows, with a similar row on the other side of "the street", and relatively low scores. But when caution is thrown to the wind, and people break the tempting cautious patterns, the intriguing depth of this simple placement game quickly shine through, and as placement become more challenging, game fulfillment also increases significantly.

The rules are very simple, but quite often sheer simplicity can be a bit tricky to explain. Playing it will clarify most rules immediately. Making sure you profit from other people's placement is key to your success, and it is often surprising where those positions are hiding. Keep an eye on other people's reserves as a sudden burst of roofs can mean the game ends quite a bit earlier than you might expect.

Maybe it's time to shout about it a bit more from the BGG rooftops, as it is the sort of abstract game that deserves more exposure to sunlight than it is currently getting. I have played it with many players who usually are not that keen on abstract games,  and even with them it usually goes down very well. It also scales well with different player amounts, another sign that this might be a better game than it is given credit for. Maybe it was simply to expensive in its wooden make-up to get that sales breakthrough that would expose it more to the right crowd, or maybe it was the other 2 titles in the trilogy that did it a disservice. Either way, don't let it disappear into the shadows!

VARIANT: This game becomes infinitely better when players break "the habit" of diagonal sun placements, and to force that on the players, it might be worth considering starting the game with a few elements already on the board. Even a few shadow tiles in random places (ignoring the question how they are able to exist) already seriously impede the possible locations for suns and direct positional play away from formulaic patterns as there are now bonus points to be had in far out places. This almost instantly creates the more "random" structures that enable far more creative and high-scoring solutions.

Another game with a scoring mechanic that is not for me.  I dislike scoring points in a game on every move; if I liked bookkeeping I would have been an accountant.  Such a shame, because this one is beautifully produced.  Likely I will re-purpose the handsome bits and board for some other game.

Given that I'm not a huge fan of abstracts, I was surprised at how much I liked this game. Simple, clever, very visually appealing, and the theme actually works, especially in conjunction with the very nice presentation. The tactics are subtle but not so tough that playing feels like work, so the game is fun to play (unlike similarly abstract, positional games such as Pueblo or Torres which seem like too much work for what little enjoyment or satisfaction they produce).

RATING: 7
One play - seven is about as high an initial rating I'd give to an abstract, which tells you I think this one is pretty good.  The sun/roof/shade mechanism is a bit more intuitive than many abstracts, so I suppose that helps.  The key is (of course) setting yourself up for big points without helping others, which can involve a small amount of feinting/bluffing which I like.  Not something I'm likely to pull, but would gladly play again.  **note** I see several others commenting on poorly written rules: since the game was taught to me and I did not read them, my rating does not reflect that.

RATING: 6
Siesta, like its sistergame Cabale (but not Caprice) is an underrated abstract game which plays very well with more than two players without feeling artificial or needlessly difficult. The players score shadows in the scoring unit called a [i]siesta[/i]: a row of suns, roofs, and shadows. A few simple placement rules drive the game, which isn't quite as simple as one would be inclined to think at first. It has less depth than Cabale which knows more about self-supporting structures and the race to obtain these, but it makes up in accessibility and tactical ease. I found it interesting to notice that Siesta isn't just about dumb point hoarding, but that trying to follow others around by inserting your own roofs in a not-quite finished siesta can be rather insidious. This strategy will of course not work all that well when there's just two players, but with more players such piggybacking can be quite worthwhile. I'm curious to see if this leads to a different mode of play when applied in a much wider extent.

I like this game. It isn't super, but it isn't totally silly either. And it looks very nice to boot.

Production: Beautiful wooden pieces in bright colors.  Even the board is wooden.  Play: A lesser entry in the category of point-maximization.  Any amount of cleverness seems to only result in an increase of a point or two in one's score for a round.  It's more like a puzzle, whereby on a player's turn one must look for the highest-scoring play, then await the next turn.  (3+0+1) (2 plays)

My tepid rating of this game is the result of about .5 of a game played.  For some reason I had difficulty following the rule of suns and shadows must not be adjacent...it totally wrecked the inaugural experience.  I'll play it again though and hope to get it right so I can get a better take on Siesta.After a 2nd game...I like this one. Obtained in Geek Trade.  I like a variant where both players place two suns (at least six spaces apart) that eliminates the diagonal sun patterns to some extent.

Great components, good game. I really do like this game, the occassional chance to pull off triple-siestas and such is quite satifying.

The only gripe I have is that once diagonal chains start, you really have no alternative but follow them through to the edge since losing those double-siesta bonuses would just be devastating. So the early game can easily devolve into a bit of 'double-siesta, 6 points' back and forth for a while.

RATING: 7
A simple positional abstract with attractive wooden components. Play is almost entirely tactical in nature, it's simply a question of seeing the highest scoring play on your turn with minimal lookahead, as setting up for a high scoring 'double siesta' is easily frustrated by an opponent. Scoring's tight so the player who takes the lead with the game-ending final turn will inevitably win. This isn't the best abstract in the world, but quirky enough for the occasional play.

The best of the three Goldsieber abstracts. Siesta actually has a whiff of a theme: suns casting shadows over rooftops–the more shadows you create, the more points you score. Everything's made of wood, board and pieces, and beautifully produced with a nice color scheme. It plays very well for two, three, or four players, a boon given that there's not too many good multi-player abstracts out there. The others in the series: Cabale (7), Caprice (5). [8 plays]

In this cunning positional strategy game players progressively fill the board aiming for sequences of pieces including a sun (from a reservoir available to all players), a roof to shine on (from each player's reserve) and the resulting shadow (from another reservoir for all players). Two elements of the game are particularly surprising: the "topic" is blended very gracefully into the mechanics behind the game (no sun and shadows together, a roof must be in between) and the way strategy prevails over tactics: there are no decisions that can really torture the player after a setup and a direction for the game are found.

Despite the materials being worth every penny spent (as usual for Goldsieber games) Siesta is essentially a multiplayer paper and pencil game. A very good one.

RATING: 6
Great bits. It's about setting up scores with your 3 actions, where a score is generated by a sequence of sun piece, one of your hut pieces, and then however many shadow pieces you can play before an opponent says enough. Which doesn't take long, maybe 2 or 3 at most. As you get 2 bonus points for setting up sun/hut combos at either end of a shadow string, you strive to set these up. As an opponent, it's just as much about placing pieces to deny your opponents as it is to set up your own scores. There's not a lot of lookahead, being more tactical, but there's certainly good plays and poorer plays based on how many future opportunities you set up for yourself. The game is about consistent scoring and it's extremely hard to get back into it if you fall behind. A decent game that earns it's spot on the shelves for its novelty, and it doesn't outstay its welcome at 30 minutes or less, but probably for lovers of abstracts only though.

This is a clever abstract game with three types of pieces: colored tents, suns (spotlights), and shadows.

RATING: 4
Players place suns, roofs and shadows, with shadows scoring points. Nice wooden pieces.

Unfortunately, with two players it's a tedious slog -- dramatic turnarounds are impossible given competent play, and competent play is easy. It's a case of scores slowly grinding up as your will to live grinds down.

The most interesting part of the system is the ability for players to score points for each other (i.e., the same shadow scoring for multiple players). In the two player game this is not useful, but I have some hope that the 3-4 player game offers sufficient scope for constructive collusion to make it worth playing.

An unusual abstract of tryign to build up scoring combinations, particularly the interesting double scoring combination. THere are a handful of placement restrictions,  players can jump in to share the points of constructions (which can be interesting) and the game is actually moved along by forcing players to score at least one on every turn.

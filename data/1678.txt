The switching sides part is pure genius.  That is why Mark Herman is ... Mark Herman.
In case you don't know what I mean, you play the underdog and if you do well, but not well enough to score the auto-victory, then you roll the die and there is a strong chance that you will switch sides.  If you take too long to beat yourself, the board wins, as happened historically.
It is too early to have a fully formed opinion.  My early impressions are that you need to get really lucky with the dice in order to win and it's better to send out a lot of tiny missions.  This is supposed to be a tough dude to win and I think it is.
There are better Mark Herman games -- because he's the greatest game designer of all-time for a reason (and his epic 2-player games are the best games out there!), but this is a really solid game and probably the most original idea I ever saw in a solitaire game, because you are playing against yourself and the A.I.

An intriguing solitaire game. The Peloponnesian War scenario suffers from an exceptional gamey stratagem.  The player can achieve a decisive victory if either side surrenders by the end of game turn 3.  With a little luck, the player can drive down the bellicosity of the Spartans significantly on turn 1, switch sides on turn 2, and then engage in operations designed to drive down the Spartan's bellicosity.
If these operations don't cause the bellicosity level to reach zero, there is turn 3 to reach zero bellicosity and achieve a player decisive victory.  

This tactic stands the design intent of switching sides on its head.  The simple thing is to adhere to the design intent of playing either side as well as possible.  A doable house rule is for the player to suffer an immediate defeat 
if the side he is currently playing reaches zero bellicosity
or if that side reaches a SCI of -3 at any point during the turn.

Another problem concerns Fortresses.  In the Comprehensive 
Example of Play, paragraph 22, the Athenians attack Thebes, a Fortress space.  They lose this battle and so must vacate the space.  But what if they had won?  Do they capture the Fortress without having to besiege it?  Do they have to besiege it next turn?  I don't know. A house rule over on web-grognard is as follows: "A battle in itself does not give control over an area.  Resolve an immediate siege after the battle if necessary." This solves the problem.

With the two above house rules, the solitaire game plays smoothly and is quite enjoyable.  The game is also a decent "history lesson" on one of the more fascinating wars in history.  I highly recommend it.

Very good solo game with lots of inovations.  You play against the system and you swap sides if you do too well.  Very different from other solo dice fests I own.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

Moderate complexity solitaire wargame that has truly unique rules for the A/I opponent: when you start to beat the A/I you have to switch sides! Designer Mark Herman figured (correctly) that the weak link of all solitaire games, be they manual or computerized, is the Artificial Intelligence (or A/I). What better way to get around that conundrum than by making the player play both sides, but only one side at a time! What happens is that when you start to achieve victory as one side the chances are likely that you'll have to switch sides and take the side you've just been beating up on! In addition to the fine game design, the historical lessons are quite deep here. Too bad Lyndon Johnson & William Westmoreland didn't play this game!

Si le thème est intelligemment reproduit par des mécanismes simples et efficaces, hélas, les directives du camp non-joueurs sont parfois aberrantes, voire suicidaires.
Il suffit à l'Athénien de conquérir une cité côtière à deux zones de Sparte avec un seul navire pour que le camp non-joueur spartiate envoie une force terrestre monstrueuse mais incapable de bloquer le ravitaillement par la mer...

RATING: 6
Rating after 1 full game and a couple half-completed games.

On the whole this is a decent solitaire game, and if you're a fan of this time period I think you will enjoy it. However, it's now going on 20 years old and showing its age. The rulebook could definitely use some clarifications and streamlining, and some rules need tweaking. I had a hard time keeping all the rules straight and made several mistakes, several times, in each of the games I started. The historical commentary and example of play were nice. The commentary itself needs polish, as it has an odd tendency to switch between narrative styles midstream.

I definitely recommend looking at http://mountford.net/ppw.

The good news is that you can make whatever changes you want for the solitaire game and, hey, no one will care! :)

Good solitaire wargame from Mark Herman, where players are trying to conquer one side and win the game before the system forces them to play the other side.  Some remarkable concepts from a remarkable designer.

RATING: 7
It has a nice map of the whole of Greece, the Ionian coast lines (modern day Turkey) and Sicily all of which had colonies from various Greek city-states. The map portrays city-states in a square and all squares are connected by lines to allow movement of troops and navies between them. The warring factions are Athens and Sparta hence the title of the game. In between you have very many allies and neutral city states that might change side as war progresses. Counters are simple depicting strength of infantry, cavalry and triremes. City states might send supporting troops, triremes, can rebel, be sacked or conquered according to political status. Although Battle clashes are abstract they give realistic results.  The game rules have solitaire suitability but give better results in a two-player mode. All historical events (political & military) can take place in this simulation.

Good historical sim, Taught me some history. I've left a session report on the page.  

Having read the history of this conflict the game has gone up a little in my opinion. It manages to distill the asymmetries and points of gravity into its game system. Its ultimately about destroying your opponents wheat supplies and trade routes and avoid direct conflict.

Classic era war between Athens and Sparta, with forays by both into the western extremities of the Persian Empire.  
Early "linked boxes", rather than hexes game (which to my mind better suits strategic games in the Ancient-early 19th Century).
Perhaps due for a CDG rework to take into account the intrigue off the battlefield?
Recall when I bought PW that it didn't have all that much "stuff" in the box for the price charged!

This is the best of the AH wargames - for me. Much shorter and much less complicated than their other war games. Yet it IS a wargame with lots of strategies and counter-strategies.

RATING: 8
Hard game to get a grip on, in terms of rules.  Does take some mental effort to get the box out and set it up, but whenever I have trouble doing so, I just go read up those great articles about this game in Avalon Hill's General Magazine and the game's history and BOOM, I am in up to my neck in ancient warfare.  As you know from the various bits of information online, you play both sides and I really think it works well for this game.  Its a deep game and takes a few plays to form coherent strategies, but once you master the rules and get use to this type of warfare, it is really fun.  I wish all those hundreds of GMT games came with solitaire rules such as this, I would be broke if they did!

I have only ever solo this, there are two player rules online and in AH general magazine that I have never tried.

Highly recommended for a near grognard that likes this sort of ancient battle theme.

The solitaire system is a nice rinky-dinky idea that works fine for a playing or so but is too easily exploited to provide a lasting challenge or carry an entire game. Beyond that, the forces are inadequately small and it is simply much too abstract to be a simulation (the Aegina sea route bottleneck, say no more!) yet overly complicated and lonely for Euro-gamers.

A perfect blend of historicity, philosophy, politics, military operations in a solitaire game format. Immerse yourself with this epic struggle between Athenians and Spartans in the classical world: Athenian coastal cities ravaging raids vs. powerful Spartan intercepting land forces. A delicate design with the perfect mix of fun, playability, replayability and complexity. Game mechanics is simple and yet operated in a clever system  framework. Calculating the shortest possible path to achieve victory per the victory condition is "the" addiction for a solo game, more so for this game as you strive to do that before the system calls you to switch to the weaker side for another uphill struggle against the better enemy, which not long ago, you just almost make him victorious.....Ground-breaking gaming concept and great simulation mechanics, Peloponessian War is the best and greatest solitare game in wargame history.  Read the designer notes and historical notes in the game, then read the book History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides.  You will love and be amazed by the designer's craftmanship.  An underrated creation and a real gem in itself, play it, fall in love with the game and the designer Mark Herman and this fascinating period in history.

It is very rare to find a good solitaire wargame design nowadays. This is definitely the one. The designer's meticulous design approach to things and the way absolved in a solitaire game experience is amazing. You would come to appreciate and awed by the "AI" system in a solitaire game, if this is ever designed as good as that like in Peloponnesian War. A good "AI" system is just like a good computer AI that you find immersed with in a PC game. In fact, designing a solitaire game is much more difficult than a 2-players or more wargame. If you can beat an "AI" opponent in a solitaire game, the sense of accomplishment is much greater than 2-players game because you "played" both sides and all that.

It is an excellent wargame. My no.1 wargame in my top 10 - happens to be a solitaire design. Its strategic depth and gaming experience that I had were unbeaten so far in my book. A fantastic game.

This rating is based on two plays of the solitaire game. It was fun to play each individual turn, but the mechanism by which you have to switch sides if you start winning prevents you from identifying with the side you're playing. Not sure I like that. I'd really like to try this two player.

There is also a fair amount of randomness involved; I normally don't mind randomness, but the amount here is right on the edge of my level of tolerance.

This started out as a solitaire game, where you switch sides if you do too well. The author's later fleshed out the multi-player rules, and seem to prefer that version.

For solitaire, the rules seem very rigid about choice of leader and path. House rules necessary.  I think WBC had some standards years ago?  Hard to score a knockout when you can't predict how many actions you will have.

Finally got to play this.  Got my butt whipped at the Archidamian scenario- I scored a big, fat 0 points.  Took me three hours to play the three turns.  Not always sure what I should be doing, and the orders of battles confused me.  My turns seemed a bit 'samey'.  Will try again, and I hope soon, so that I've not forgotten everything.

A solitaire game which had some interesting touches, like the player always playing the side that was behind at the start of the turn. Movement was unlimited and invading armies automatically trashed the territories they move through, while sieges were very difficult. as a result most of the game was marching and looting, which had some kind of historical validity, but there were sieges and battles, which as a play I would avoid.

RATING: 4
This seems to get very high ratings, but I don't really understand why. It feels too easy to "work" the matrix for the non-player power so that you can distract him by sending large forces on pointless goose chases, while you send lots of little forces to pick up large numbers of points. Sparta, especially, can have problems doing more than one operation as the forces it requires for some of the operations often use up most of its army. In the end, the augury roll for how many operations you can do is one of the key factors in whether you win or not.

The central dilemma of "do too well, and you'll end up having to fight for the weaker force" isn't as interesting in practice as in theory, as you only need to pick up points to win from the success of both sides, and not necessarily the defeat of one. Therefore, you can leave the other sides forces more or less intact and concentrate on picking up points through taking fortresses. 

There are also all sorts of strange little situations, especially those connected to when fleets unaccompanied by land troops meet lands armies without fleets. 

The victory conditions feel entirely wrong, too. According to the official victory conditions, there's no point playing beyond turn 3 in the campaign. And the Archidamian War scenario has exactly the same set up, but you need only 40 VPs to win by turn 3, whereas you need 150 VPs by turn 3 to win in the campaign scenario.

All in all, far less promising than the rules suggest. 

Traded for Rommel in the Desert.

Clever and easy to learn solo game. The system is no match after a few contests, but the 2 players version is still potent.

The Good: A faithful rendering of the Peloponnesian war.The Bad: A faithful rendering of the Peloponnesian war. Asymentrical war is pretty darn boring.

So far this my favorite point to point game after We the People. It certainly has some twists which I think represents the unpredictability of the period well.

Still the best solo war game.

RATING: 7
Peloponnesian War is the best simulation of history for an ancient world strategy game, because it overcomes one of the greatest obstacles for a wargame to recreate history: to PERFORM incompetently when PLAY competently.
 The flow of the campaign itself calls for some incompetent leadership for both sides.  So the solitaire rules let you in control for the competent side and the system operates randomly (therefore no guarantee for a competent, or consistent, strategy).  Of course the player would prevail, and then the system requires you to switch to the other side, allowing the other side to turn the table; much alike the Spartans did in history. 
At heart a ground-breaking solitaire game, it still command the best prices among those Victory Game products at eBay. But the claim of multi-player friendly simply backfires, as indicated from the ratings here, which I think the game should get the same applause as the We the People game.  Maybe it should now change into a Strategy Card driven format......

This game gets a solid 8 because of the unique solo-play mechanics involved.  That, and the deeply immersing subject of the game, the great struggle of brothers, Sparta and Athens.

This is just a classic in the solo-war-game niche that I had to get for the fascinating side-switching solution to the "AI opponents are lame" problem.

Enjoy occasionally. Definitely has flaws, but also some interesting mechanics. Almost always played solo. Should never be played with more than 2 players.

RATING: 8
Great as a solo game, or as a 2 player with a committed mate. If you're not into ancient Greece, you'd better miss this one because it'll puzzle you and bore you to tears.

I suppose that it's only fair to add that if you do like games like this - and I do, very much - then you've just hit paydirt, as those Yankees say. A splendid game that will frustrate you until the day you play it FTF. And then it'll frustrate both of you.

July 2014 - I keep reading of a reissue of the game, which is fine by me. I just hope they take the opportunity to update the piss poor counters (not worthy of such a game) and borrow some of the area control rules from more recent games.

RATING: 7
A solitaire game with this peculiar "switch sides" philosophy of design (something like "Geronimo" system)that I dislike so much. Best with two players; each taking one side and sticking to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A respectable attempt at a relatively simple and clean portrayal of a conflict that's very difficult to game. The side-switching solitaire mechanism is particularly clever, but can't really make up for some gamey-ness inherent in such a simplified ruleset (e.g. the Spartans effortlessly marching a handful of Hoplites across the entire length of Greece and Thrace into the Hellespont or Ionia and maintaining a position there indefinitely despite the lack of an effective navy). Still, the game gives a decent impression of the frustrating, asymmetrical nature of the conflict. Worth playing if you can find a copy for a good price, but not worth the current eBay prices.

One thing I do to speed up play is to put  green and red markers on spaces which will cause a defensive strategy if occupied.  I also place white markers on all the Coalition spaces (which are all the spaces referenced in the Post-Combat Movement Table), as you are not allowed to create a rebellion in these spaces (unless by random event).

The rules are loose, but it doesn't matter.  This gives you the freedom to make up your own and use the rulebook as a guide.  It's a game.  It's meant to be fun and to learn something from.  This it does exceedingly well.  I really enjoy playing it and I will surely come back to it again and again.

Haven't completed a game yet, but find the game mechanic very interesting. Not sure if it encourages or inhibits aggressive play, as you know you'll be playing the loser soon - but is that a threat or a challenge?

Really like the design. Very open ended seeming though and feel that I have no grasp on how to play the game. But that is not a negative. Looking forward to another run.

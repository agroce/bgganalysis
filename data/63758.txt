The apparently limited paths and my general inertia getting the sense of the game made me dubious at first but, as the PBEM game drew to a close I found myself getting impatient for my opponent to send me files (even though he is far more reliable than me). Good fun and will certainly be happy to play again.

An interesting game with some unusual mechanics. The ability to pick up troops and drop off, then pick them up again being one of them. Any 19th Century general would have been glad to have operated in the wilderness of Canada with this kind of ability. Still enjoyable with the naval rules adding a game within a game.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent, competitive game for both sides, and it's also a pretty effective simulation.  It does make a design choice to focus on the war along the US/Canada frontier from Lake Champlain west to Fort Mackinac.  Thus, many significant events of the actual war -- like Cockburn's raids along the Chesapeake, Andrew Jackson's campaign against the Creeks, the Battle of New Orleans, and the American and British warship duels in the Atlantic -- are left to be treated by means of Event cards.  The trade-off for this is that you get a level of historical detail that I don't think would be possible otherwise, with all counters representing actual units or individual warships.  (And the level of research that has gone into figuring out the capabilities of the various individual land units and warships is most impressive.  Clearly, this was a labor of love for the designer.)  

After one full play and two other games that are nearly complete (one on-line and one FTF), I am impressed by how well-balanced this is:  as with "Wilderness War," you may think you're finished at some point, but "it ain't necessarily so."  This is in part because the land CRT allows for surprise results even at very high odds, because leader quality, terrain effects, and unit quality are great equalizers.  (I do find the naval battles less satisfying:  the number of ships is more heavily weighted than overall ship quality, and most battles produce narrow and impermanent victories.)  The map, counters, and cards are all gorgeous, as usual with GMT.  Finally, the designer is extraordinarily responsive to questions posted in the forum.  This game has not only afforded me much enjoyment, but has motivated me to take an interest in the War of 1812 for the first time since my childhood.

Initial Impressions: This is a very thematic, historical card driven game. The designer has taken some of the best ideas of CDGs and melded them into a system that works. As you play through the game you get a real sense of playing through the entire war. Basic wargaming concepts are all there and the game isn't weighted down with lots of unmanageable chrome.

RATING: 7
This is on the light side of the complexity scale, requires about 4 hours to completion.

So far it seems that the US has the greatest challenge to win. However, the way that the card deck works (with several cards unused per game, the non exclusive deck and the very much variable CRTs makes each game quite different.

There are many strategies to explore with this very long front and deep theater of operations, so another gaming group could have markedly different results than us.

In general though, the design is sound, there are no issues with the rules and the flow is very satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10

There is much that I do not understand, and since one of the obligations to having a normal life means that I cannot follow every word written on CSW, I do not know why the designer chose to limit his map to this region of the conflict. Yes, we all know it is key, but in AtA raiding or capturing costal cities, small though they are, and raiding Native American areas can provide the winning edge. Seems we took the path of least resistance in Mr. Madison's War, which, by the way, "borrows" two book titles for its title. But then so does AtA borrow one.

Mr. Madison's War is a solid, thoughtful, design.  Although it does not hold up as well when compared to Amateur to Arms, MMW is a good game.

After more plays, my rating might change.  For now, hope reigns. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Tight, focused strategy game on the War of 1812 - a very under-appreciated conflict in wargaming. I own both this and "Amateurs to Arms" now. Both compliment each other nicely and offer very different takes on the war. MMW is exactly as its designer bills it - tightly focused on strategy, with each card counting and pre-planning rewarded. Nice and light - I need to get more plays of this in, at which time my rating may improve.

I now have the game.  I am giving it a provisional rating of 8 to start after reading the rules and play book.  The map is fantastic, however I would have liked it to be mounted.  The only negative to me is that the cards are a little thinner than I would like.  Definitely much thinner than Labyrinth and Washington's War.

Have now played a game and raised rating to 8.5.  Very good game that I will be playing more very soon.

Have now played more games and raised rating to 9.

Received the mounted map board and it is beautiful.  Not required but enhances the experience.

Mediocre game, with weak and clunky game design :
- Too many useless cards in gameplay (Vp cards, cancelling move cards, ship production etc.)
- Bad combat system : uneventful, random, very few to no causalities, no historical flavour.
- Vp system for areas is annoying and mostly meaningless until the last turn. Most of operations seem futile until this last turn when VP will actually mater.
- Global conception is weak and we do not feel immersed in the historical challenges and realities, we mostly watch scripted events happens to reach abstract VP.
- Map is not very well done, placing units on the areas hide all the informations. Also maps and connections are limiting too much game's options.
- The overall game is way too scripted : major operations, conquests, troops production, naval productions, forts are mostly scripted with limited room for player's strategy.
- The game lacks flavour in general and feels too generic.

RATING: 7
After the disappointing [i]Amateurs to Arms[/i] and the enjoyable, but too light [i]1812: The Invasion of Canada[/i], this feels like it hits the sweet spot for a War of 1812 game both in terms of complexity and length. If you're familiar with CDG's, you'll pick this one up fairly quickly.

There's some tension, the events seem interesting, and the level of chrome feels appropriate without getting out of hand. Supply is crucial, and managing your forces carefully is essential to victory. The dual-effect cards make it more likely you'll actually bother to spend time building up your navy and challenging your opponent more than once, unlike AtA. The combat is somewhat reminiscent of [i]1776[/i], with a potential for multiple rounds of combat in a single battle. The step losses generally mean a loss may be significant, but won't be devastating, which feels appropriate.

This is not to say it's without its issues. The rulebook could definitely have used a review from a neophyte, as it makes some assumptions about player experience that has resulted in a large number of rules questions, and there's some errata. The cards are decent, though a few too many are raw VP events. At least it's not as bad as [i]Amateurs to Arms[/i] in this respect, which had way way too many point scoring cards. Here it's at least it's not utterly unreasonable.

More significantly, I think the naval combat chart needs a makeover, as it's essentially an all or nothing affair since either your entire fleet is destroyed, or your ships are damaged, but naval repairs are free. Why go to the trouble of differentiating between schooners, corvettes and brigs only to resolve naval combat in such a coarse and uninteresting manner? Also, don't use dr modifiers with assymetric combat results tables. You get weird cases where bonuses actually hurt you.

On top of that, the game is a bit brittle in that the loss of Sacket's Harbor on turn 1 is fairly brutal, meaning experienced players should always play the Americans or it could be a quick game. Given that the British were ordered on the defensive at this time, their ability to invade south early with such superior force in 1812, and without penalty, feels a bit like a Canadian dream scenario.

I suspect the game will have a hard stop somewhere around 6-8 plays, though that's more of a function of the topic in question, rather than any particular flaw in the design. Still, that's not bad. Plus, it's short and can be played in an evening.

So, seems interesting, good for a few plays especially if you're a fan of the time period, but not at the top of the CDG pile for me.

RATING: 9
One of the better CDG wargames which does nicely in dividing the decks into each of the 3 years to avoid grossly ahistorical results.  There are also very few wargames based on the War of 1812; the one I owned before MMW (came from a S&T issued I believe) wasn't very playable.  Does a nice job of abstracting the oceanic naval conflict (often between just 2 vessels), yet giving the players the chance to manage the more significant naval conflict on the Great Lakes, including amphibious operations.  By keeping the scope of the action primarily to the northern border war, MMW also focuses correctly on those battles of greatest relevance to the War of 1812.  The rules of MMW are much easier to assimilate than some popular CDGs like For the People, Virgin Queen, Paths of Glory/Pursuit of Glory, and Empire of the Sun. Rulebook is understandable with decent cross-referencing and indexing to find rules when needed.  Playbook does a nice job of illustrating the key mechanics of the game.  If you're interested in late 18th to early 19th Century conflicts, MMW should be on your "wish list."

I enjoyed my plays and will play again when asked.  I certainly feel challenged to play better.

I don't agree with the reviewers who say it's a good rule book. It is not that good.  It has flaws that should have been fixed.  Experienced wargame players can infer the intention but a new player would be at a loss.  Like the way the die modifier for first player in 1813, if taken literally, is if both players have more than 6 VPs, both would automatically win initiative?  Also Combat reaction cards specify on the card if they are good for only one round.  The rules say it is the other way around, cards are good for only one round unless specified on card.   Also the word "enemy" is used where attacker or defender would have been much clearer.   There are others examples like that.  

The way the Lake Control works for VP's in the game, it likely will come down to big winner take all battles in the last 2 turns.

RATING: 6
There are some good things going on here, starting with the clear and well organized rulebook. I like the individual regiments and the interaction between naval and land operations. The situation offers a different challenge for both sides (British supply lines, American inexperience) and Collins captures this dynamic quite well. However, I have too many nagging concerns. The events are super specific and gamey, such as choosing between gaining victory points for naval victories in the Atlantic or moving Hull. This is a false choice in light of history. Decatur's victories would have no bearing on Hull's ability to move. To be fair, plenty of CDGs do just that, the difference here is that the game is operational in scope and does them just a little too often. Rather than there being a mechanic for leader death it is handled with specific cards, such as with Brock. Also, the CRT is too pro defense. All in all, this was a disappointment but not one without worth.

Excellent game. I play with my brother, and we both thoroughly enjoy it. It has the perfect balance between competitive and tightness of design and experience play. Currently one of our favorite CDG's and board game. After a few plays we can play it in 2-3 hours. Which means it gets played often and they are very intense games.

Have been playing with two variants that change Lake VP scoring and playing with an additional card draw. Have had a few great evenings.

A great game covering the War of 1812 around the Great Lakes.  Minor gains have to be held by small forces while larger gains require more serious occupation.  Sweeping advances are not realistic because the number of troops is so minimal and supplies are so necessary.  Always more fun than I think it will be.

This game does an amazing job of capturing the feel of the War of 1812. That's going to be off-putting to some people. The War of 1812 was noted for things like militia refusing to leave the country, inconclusive naval engagements and small forces overcoming much larger forces. The game duplicates these events in its mechanics. I'd give it a "10" except that I'm not always in the mood for War of 1812 weirdness. But when I am, this is outstanding.

The Game That Killed the War of 1812

It isn't easy to have 2 charts in your design and break both of them.

The land CRT is designed around the premise that Higher is Better - better units, leaders, cards, etc. give you bonuses; that is all fine.  However, the CRT has the cardinal sin of one result (9) being worse than the lower results (6,7,8) when you are attacking a fort.  In this case, the bonus actually hurts you.

The naval CRT is designed around the idea of wanting decisive single battles - again, all well and good.  In this case though, assuming both sides are evenly matched, there can be no decisive results; the most you can have is a temporary knock out of the lake with damage that is automatically repaired at the end of the turn.  To get the decisive results, one side needs to have an advantage, and in this case, only the disadvantaged side can have a decisive loss - why on earth would they fight? - you can vacate the lake for free at the start of the turn if you see the situation has changed.  The CRT enforces boring results.  Now, if you scored points every turn you controlled the lake and not just points at the end of the game, there might be some risk taking, but that isn't the game as designed.

From a historical perspective, I find it interesting that main source of any aggressive movement is the British into the US, rather than vice-versa.  Especially considering the fact that the CiC for the British was under orders to maintain a defensive strategy - shouldn't the game have some cost in VP or a necessary event to completely ignore the orders from their superiors?

Finally, IMHO, the pre-game turns are just a trap to see if they Americans can correctly defend Sackets Harbor.  Look closely at the impact of losing this space the first turn - there is absolutely no reason to play past this, so there is no reason to have it a possibility in the game design.  I'm sure both sides can make some bad moves during this phase, but other than that, it is just an uninteresting randomizer.

Between this and AiA, I can close the book on any hope that an enjoyable War of 1812 game will be made.

My preliminary rating is an 8 based on a read through of the rules and soloing through the entire first year. As others have noted, the complexity nicely falls right between We the People/Washington's War and Wilderness War. The playtime appears to be about the same as the tournament scenario from Wilderness War. There are a number of interesting variations in mechanics that may make this a real winner of a game if play balance ends up being good as well. My rating may rise after I get to play a two player match of it.

I pre-ordered Mr. Madison's War last year when GMT P500ed the game and I'm glad I did. I got a chance to play Mr.Mads War at Prezcon. Mr. Mads War is a classic card driven war game that is similar enought to Hannibal, WWr and Wilderness War and other game to make it easy for any card driven war game to learn.  Yet the game has enough rule changes to give the flavor and feel of one of the strangest wars in America history.

RATING: 6
Simple and plays fairly fast. I just found that there was possibly too much of the victory points available on the cards. I think that I had about half of my victory points via card play rather than what was on the map. I can see that the design intent of this is to have those card points account for parts of the war not on the map. I just couldn't get over the very abstract feeling of playing the burn Washington card when I had no troops anywhere past Lake Champlain. 

Definately worth trying a play through and I'd try it again, the actual game was very close with my opponent.

CDG of the War of 1812.  There are some unique concepts here and I especially liked the naval interaction on the Great Lakes, plus the game plays faster than one would suspect.  The issue is that it has the same problems that most CDGs have and that is not enough cards to do all the things you really need to do each turn.  What happens is that forces sit around in the same locations for long periods of time or there are no naval developments for well over a year.

I was curious as to how this game would cover the British invasion on the East Coast leading to the Battle of Bladensburg and burning Washington, DC.  A card takes care of it awarding the British victory points.  The Great Lake fleets remind me of a 19th century M.A.D. situation were the game can be won or lost in a turn essentially.  This keeps a constant chess-like game going as many players don't do the 'all or nothing' thing.  Components are top notch and unit counter density is low and rather manageable.  A good couple of hours can be entertained and rewarded with this game.

I love modern CDG board games and this is one of the best. Might be one of the easiest to get into as well. The game covers the actions around the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. All other events, such as the burning of Washington or the US Navy's famous frigate actions are handled by card events. The game has a unique setup in that both players use card values to move forces into position before the shooting starts. The Declaration of War is a surprise, and the pre-game preparations are over when it's drawn. This could result in immediate clashes if both sides had maneuvered forces onto the front lines during the pre-game, or the DoW could come out quickly, leaving both sides a bit flat-footed. Combat is simple, with terrain and Leader effects and combat cards, modifying a 2d6 roll. Results can be surprising and devastating, just as fighting was during this era. A great complement to my favorite CDG, Wilderness War.

RATING: 6
Serviceable but slightly lacklustre: tab A certainly fits into slot B; however, with so many great CDGs out there, especially from GMT, a card-driven game really needs something special to stand out these days. This, Mr Madison's War lacks. 

It's a shared deck CDG, where cards can be used for events or OPs. Basically, you are fighting over four major choke points, while making sure you don't get too far behind in the struggle for naval superiority. The British have to deal with the problems created by long supply lines, the American with their inferior troops and commanders. There are lots of points on the cards, and you don't want to find yourself so pressed that you can't play them (playing a card with points for the event is normally going to be a no-brainer). 

However, the game lacks tension. A CDG should thrive on the feeling that you have so much to do and so little to do it with. In Mr Madison's War, there is no feeling of urgency, that the next card could lead to triumph or disaster. I think there are various reasons for this: the bountiful points on the Event Cards, the spread of the VPs on the board and the ease of retreat before combat. In addition, too many events are too tightly scripted, meaning that they can only be used in very specific circumstances. I rarely felt the dilemma of whether I should use a card for its event or its OPs.

This is a pity as in terms of length and complexity it is almost my idea of perfection. The rules are between Washington's War and Unhappy King Charles in difficulty; the game seems to take slightly longer Washington's War. 

In summary, it's not a bad game, but I'd say that it's only really for those with a specific interest in the topic.

this is a really good game. especially for a Canadian, it's one of the few conflicts I can really get invested in in a  historical sense. the single 2d6 (w/+- modifiers) combat roll pisses me off and delights me in equal measure. I don't want to like it, but I do...it really raises the stakes of combat. Wouldn't want it in every game, but it works here.

it's locked in to a large extent w/r/t strategy, but this makes for a nice object study. recommended accompaniment to read: Pierre Burton's War of 1812.

DO NOT UNDERVALUE LAKE CONTROL! I've lost more than a few games by doing just this.

At this time I am reading the rules. The rulebook is well written and easy to read. My habit for a new game is to read the rulebook three times then play. The rulebook is done so well I feel I could play the game just after reading it just once. The examples of play and design notes were very helpful.

A pretty good game The British road network/supply line reminds me of the children's game Red Rover. What point in the line does the American player try to break? It has a nice intergration of land and naval action. I like the how there are cards for each year and when one discards them, they can't be used again. This makes if different from some of the other CDGs. Also I liked how there were more cards for a year that would not be able to get played, that way each game will be somewhat different. IMHO Gilbert Collins designed a very nice game on the War of 1812, I am glad I purchased it.

While this one is slow-paced and indecisive, it does present both players with an equal number of challenges.  The fact that blowouts are nearly impossible makes the game more engaging than many.  The slowness is a downer to some extent, but I enjoyed myself and I felt that the system was very appropriate to the subject.

Have played this a few times.  Both sides have managed wins so play is fairly even between evenly matched players.

*****Slapping a 7 on this until I can rate..... just so my comments can be seen by people who may be interested. Have a feeling the rating will climb.******


Liking what I'm seeing so far.

Non-generic units? Pre-war maneuvering? Total designer support?

I'm looking forward to taking this for a whirl.

I want to like this game - and I do I think it does a decent job of simulating the conflict - but honestly, it is a boring game.

Edit - Game got better in year 1814 - felt like I could do stuff.  I also suspect it will get better with more plays.  But I am somewhat concerned about the Naval Combat table - very swingy - especially with a +/-2 DRM card.

Nice small rules set and low unit count but still the full familiar experience found in other GMT CDG games.  The thin nature of the front and sparse units make it a challenge on where to concentrate you forces to effect a victory.

After a good half-dozen plays, and three pbem matches currently ongoing, I'm a fan of this take on the Lakes/Lawrence theater of the war.  The game hits somewhere between Washington's War and Wilderness War in both complexity and length, making it a very strong candidate for a pbem tourney/ladder (waiting anxiously for that to take off).

The Good
-Scale matches theater well, and definitely "feels" like the conflict along the us/canada border

-Individual units represented... love the granularity of sending the RNR up against the 1st Ohio.  It certainly helps "ground" the game.

-Quick, "light" wargame, which is pretty easy to pick up and, therefore, focused on the operational management of forces in a very fluid manner.

-Interesting mechanisms with the lakes and the combat systems.  Factoring in the "class" of the units works well here, and the management of the naval operations/lake control makes for interesting logistical knots to untie.   

The Not-so-Good
-There's an awful lot of "railroading" for a game of this type.  To cite several examples:

*Neither player has any real control over land reinforcements, which arrive on a pre-determined schedule.

*The two magic-bullet leader killed cards, targeting Brock and Tecumseh, are just off.  Harrison, Procter, Scott, DeRott could just as easily have caught stray (or focused) ammunition in battle as Brock or Tecumseh... 

*The same holds true for several cards in the deck, which are intended to mimic real events in a straight-jacketed way.  Forts can only be built in their real-life footprint, and only by pulling the named card... just seems way off.

*I generally dislike the negative-choice presented by having to choose between, say, playing a card that represents the burning of DC for VPs or for ops to move an army in the niagara theater.  I appreciate that it helps the narrative to have VP cards reflecting events outside the limits of the game landscape, but here it just feels a bit off. 

The Great

-MMW is just a really fun game, and does provide a strong narrative on the war for the lakes and the St. Lawrence.  I have several nits to pick with some of the card mechanisms, but none seriously detract from the overall experience.

Having played most of the War of 1812 games now on the market, this one likely has the strongest legs long-term.  MMW could well find the same level of audience as Wilderness War, given the similarities in complexity, style and length.

United States tries to overtake Canada away from the Brits. Conflict theatre is mostly around the Great Lakes. This is a card driven war game with point to point movement, lots of different units to control, and naval battles which I don't recall seeing much in this genre. Simplized combat. Reference the modifier based on forces differential. Compare a 2d6 roll against a results table. Reminds me of the old D&D crit table. Designer says the randomness built into the combat system is intentional to simulate the history of these battles. I like the event cards applying to specific areas to add more depth to the history of the engagement circumstances.

Fairly straightforward system, although the combat modifiers are a little tough to sort out.  Plays pretty smoothly and quickly, but I'm having a hard time deciding how to play well.  Naval combat is quite bloody.

I think players who enjoy "Wilderness War", "Washington's War" and "For the People" will like this classic CDG game. It fits in nicely between the French and Indian War and the  American Revolution.

Like most designers, I put in all the stuff 'I like' in CDG games and took out all the stuff I didn't like. So, by default it becomes one of my favourite CDG games.

I always used to think that a designer choosing his own game as his favourite a bit of a conceit. But I don't see it that way now for the reasons stated above.

If a designer takes out all the things he doesn't like in a game, it is only natural that that game might turn out to be his  favourite.

But, blowing my own horn a bit, I think this is a good GAME on the War of 1812 and a decent simulation. Also a good learning tool. Another objective of mine. I think players should learn something about a war while playing a simulation on it.

With my big, clumsy fingers I had my reservations with the high counter stacks of Mr. Madison's War. I could have hated the high frequency VP swings or die rolling luck factor, too, but the design earned its place amongst the other high quality card-driven GMT wargames in my collection. The swinginess means that you should never quit even if the enemy has a comfortable lead. The tables can easily be turned after another year further into the war. You can pour more manpower into a fight but there are only so many targets at any given time standing in the enemy formation. The Incredible War of 1812 has its pecularities and the do or die naval combat system on the Great Lakes alone is worth the effort. A Moral Victory result may not move the borders too much but all the more reason to have just one more drink in celebration.

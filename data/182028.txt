GAME: Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization
RANK: 3
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a great game, though I still don't understand why you can't draft military cards like you can civil. For a game where you have so much control, and military is so overpowered, the luck of the draw can really mess you up.

I've played this almost exclusively at BGO, so I'm not sure how high I would rank this if I had to play face to face and wait to play, which I can avoid with a turn-based online game.

RATING: 9.15
Masterpiece. One of the best game I've ever played. It has strategy, theme, interaction, lots of cards for replay value.

I haven't got a chance to play the original version of the game, but I wanted for a long time. Now I'm glad I did not, because this is an improved version of the game in every aspect.

Only downside is downtime, since every player has many actions during a turn. Also, long play time can be considered a downside - average 3 player game for us lasts around 4.5 to 5 hours - but when you have time to invest, that time invested is an upside to the game because of a very rewarding experience.

Update: average 3 player game now lasts only for about 2.5 to 3 hours tops, since now we all know what we are doing. With 4th player added, it can go to 5 hours easily. Great experience with 4, but huge time investment :)

I believe this is a perfect game. It accomplishes what it sets out to do, and does it in a perfectly satisfying and fun way. For having no map, it somehow completely delivers the same feeling that Sid Meier's Civilization (VG) does. It's odd to think that such a "dry" theme, with abstract boards and cards would have such a strong thematic feel to it, but Through the Ages pulls it off admirably. I really love this game. It's not my favorite game, but I have zero complaints about it and see it as always engaging.

RATING: 9
All the updates seem to make sense and make the game better, especially making the game less military focused.  This really improves the game since more cards and strategies are now viable. I also like the new graphic design.

This game is awesome overall (and likely highly addictive).

Substracting a world map from a civ sim gives this an appearance as gripping as a driving school lecture book. But what an ingenious abstractation of mankind's civilization (Western Europe's, to be honest) this game really is!

I love how this comes out in one piece with all mechanisms fitting perfectly together. Other games would have saved Leaders, Wonders etc. for some expansions' extra cash.

Please be aware that this game presents a misanthropic and bellicist view on mankind (as Sid Meier's Civilization series does) that one should always reflect!

Military seems to be too overpowered at the end of the game. Game was nice. I can't deny that. However duration is so long that I propably won't end playing this again. That is what lowers the score quite a lot. Game was good but I'm just not a fan of long games. This game has earned its rank 3 but I don't personally see much situations when I would play this.

Lungo, a volte lunghissimo, senza la scenografica composizione di un territorio da esplorare, conquistare e sfruttare per progredire al meglio e con un (doppio) regolamento che spaventa i più.

Meglio girarne al largo quindi? Macchè!

Un 10 pieno per questo gioco che, personalmente, mi ha fatto sentire più di ogni altro provato, sul tema, quel senso di crescita e sviluppo della propria civiltà attraverso un meccanismo molto semplice, nelle regole, quanto complesso e gratificante, nel saperlo gestire.
E' fondamentalmente un gioco di carte (che scorrono su un display comune), con una profondità incredibile e una varietà di scelte che permette sviluppi sempre differenti.

Questa è la mia scelta per un gioco di civilizzazione corposo, altrimenti un perfetto "concentrato" sul tema è The Golden Ages di Luigi Ferrini.

RATING: 10
The previous TTA was a 9, excellent Civ builder, and a game I will play almost any time. The only strikes against it were the randomish military draw/balance and the length. Length in and of itself was not a mark against the game, just limited how often I could play it.

This version streamlines some of the length issues, and addresses and rebalances a bunch of other things, based on data from lots and lots of plays. The changes to how military is handled are subtle but genius. As a result, the only reason I wouldn't play this game is if I don't have the time at that session. Flawless game.

RATING: 10
Guys, I love the original TTA, but this one got even better. The military aspect of the original game played a huge role on the game, that's why I rated it a 9, but it is really fixed on the new TTA. Sure the military path has it's reward, but it is more difficult to play an aggression or a war, and there is no more holy war, the devastating card that can put an entire well developed civilization on the stone age again.

All the changes I've seem are better than the original game, the cards are more attractive, even the usually skipped theocracy is now a good card to pick. The changes in rule are for better for sure. It is a genuine 10, one of my favorite games of all time even better.

Almost forgot, the art of this version is much much better from the original TTA.

Impressively designed game of sustainable growth with some hand management and a fun drafting mechanic.  What I like best is that you can accumulate points in a variety of ways without having the scoring devolve into a "points salad."  There's a victory track visible all game long, and you can plan accordingly.  Unlike a typical Rosenberg or Feld game, you aren't going to spend minutes tallying up points after the final round, and you aren't forced to diversify your approach in order to win.  It plays somewhat long, and the first few games might be awkward with a lot of down time as players take their turns, but this is fun and challenging game.

It should be named :It takes Ages, A new story of Accounting. You do not build a civ, it doesn't feel that way at all. It plays like a football manager game. There are some good ideas in the game, but the duration plus the idiotic subsystems make it sub par. One of the most overrated games in BGG. It has one of the worse combat systems in a civ game that i have ever encountered.

FFG's out of print Sid Meyer's Civilization is better in many ways. Nations also scratches the same itch but it's a 30min per player game. 

Also forgot to congratulate the new publisher on the serious component upgrade compared to the previous edition. CGE is one of the best companies in terms of cost to quality ratio.My hat is off to you!

Through the Ages is an outstanding game.
Its very well balanced, has high replayability value and offers a lot of strategic and tactical descisions. Its a lot better balanced than the previous edition, due to the change of the Napoleon card and the redesign of the war/raid mechanics. Its a tense gamefeeling, where you absolutely feel as if you are building your own civilization over the course of the time. What is really interesting is the trouble-shooting aspect in every single round. Every play you do has its own opportunity cost, so you are forced to think about to pick your best move and to balance out your civilization or to start switching to mass culture Porduction in the end game. Another interesting aspect are the different combos of cards (like Hanging gardens + basilica + michaelangelo) and how it effects your late game strategy (in this case going more on military to pressure your opponent, so you can prevent him from catching up later).  
A slight con might be the long playtime for new players and higher player counts (4 players), because it can really drag on then. But the game absolutely catches the theme and I'm glad to have this game in my collection.

Okay, the design of this game is just sublime. It is very well  balanced and every card in this game can be a part of a viable strategy. I really love the way the military part of the game works, its somehow appealing to both those liking player interaction and those not. The game can drag into 3-4 hours (maybe more)of gaming sessions,  but after you finish, you feel that you ve done so many things. Thats because every turn doesnt take much time and on the contrary every player just takes multiple turns per session.

I actually think the app is what is awesome about this game. I think it would be too much work to play as an actual board game (and too slow). As an app though, the computer automates all the tedious tasks. There are a lot of deep and interesting choices and every game is going to be at least somewhat different, and I would say the best player is going to win at least 80-90 percent of the time (people think there is a lot of luck, but I would say it really isn't too bad). One of the most brilliant card games.

This new edition looks superior to the earlier one, but that is the only comparison I am qualified to make. Great game where you are surging forward through history, the different ages represented as a sort of parade of cards that you're buying from. Lots of checks and balances in this game, managing corruption, preventing uprisings, deciding when to take military actions against other players, and I love the thematic abilities of the many leader cards, wonders etc that will be visiting you in the lineup. The events are also neat, how you're adding them for future turns, really ups the strategy. Not my favorite Vlaada game, but it might creep up there with future plays, because it is substantial and I've barely cracked the surface.

This is an absolutely brilliant card-drafting engine-building game. There is a plethora of interesting tactical and strategic decisions. Everything has consequences and the game bombards you with tons of concrete information to make informed decisions. Randomness is limited and when it does exist, it is controlled (auction/drafting mechanic) and/or player driven (events). But what I love most about this game is it feels like your walking a tight-rope; you want to optimize your engine but you want to be able to respond to possible aggressions from the other players. Thus, the game is quite interactive and builds tension by forcing players to make tough decisions on how they should distribute their finite resources. 

This latest edition changes the artwork, balances some cards, and makes some minor rules changes. Overall, it feels like a more polished version of the classical game. But I strongly recommend players purchase/play this version. Some of the minor rule changes (e.g. when military cards are discards) actually make a profound change in the game (e.g. reducing AP). And the rebalancing of warfare still keeps that element influential but prevents the 2-player game from being dominated by that element. 

Brilliant game. Love it! I've played this game a dozen times and want to play it more.

Ugyanazt a lehengerlő játékélményt adja, mint a régi TTA, de vannak dolgok, amik még jobbak. Először is sokkal szebb az új játék. Másodszor sok dolog életszerűbb lett. Pl. a különböző értékek korlátozásai megszűntek, a háborúban és agressziónál a seregek beáldozása megszűnt, a taktikák másolhatók, stb. Harmadsorban logikusabb és kicsit letisztultabb is az új tálalás, az ikonozás felhasználóbarátabb, pl. a kártyapaklis kis táblán, és a kártyákon lévő redundanciák is megszűntek.
Amit nem értek, hogy miért kellett 5 felé bontani a fő táblát. Sokkal több helyet foglal így!
Összességében egy amúgy is szuper játékot még jobbá sikerült varázsolni. Bár nem szeretem a klónokat, ez a 2.0 tetszik. Mert igaz hogy csak 2% az eltérés, és igaz, hogy aki az eredeti szabálykönyvet ismeri, annak elég átolvasni, hogy mi az a 10-12 apróság, ami változott, mégis... szerintem érdemi változások is vannak. Aki a régit szereti, az próbálja ki! Forradalmi újítást nem talál, de azért más lett, főleg a háború és az agresszió.
A 2 személyes játék továbbra sem rövid:) A szabály 1 óra volt, a játék 4 és fél óra:) De rövidíthető szerintem 2-3 órára. Állítólag a 4 személyes határozottan rövidebb, mint a régiben, mert kevesebb a 4 fős kártya.
---
3 db 2 főset játszottam, mindet más emberrel, egyikük már játszott a régivel, a másikuk még nem ismerte, de amúgy sok száz játékot ismer, harmadikuk nagyon ritkán társasozik. Nos mindhárom parti pont 4 és fél órás volt, plusz a szabály, ami 30-40 perc. Most azt mondom, nehezen hiszem, hogy 3 és fél óránál hamarabb lemegy, a 3 fős pedig legalább 6 óra szerintem, a 4 fős meg 7-8:) A kártyasor elejéről több személynél sokkal kevesebb lap esik le, és több lap is van a paklikban.

This is a game that provides players the ability to pursue a grand strategy. More importantly, it lets players sort through the numerous options and choose how they want to implement their strategy. Additionally, you need to be watchful over what the other players are doing to mitigate/maximize the effects of events and military.  The card play and hand building also provide another level of decisions, as you attempt to efficiently purchase cards. There's lots of engaging game play here--assuming you want to invest the time. 

Game sessions also exhibit a good amount of variation. Admittedly, the players drive the variation, but the game's system facilitates the players' ability to choose different strategies and/or influence the progression of the game. The ability for the players to craft the event deck is an engaging way to increase variation between plays. The game, for all its repetition from turn to turn, does manage to provide an arc. While most of the arc is simply power creep, it is satisfying to see your "civilization" hammer out those final rounds and generate victory points (even if you lose).

Now, for a few neutral/negatives. One: the production is about as abstract as I'll allow a civ game to be. Also, I'm not a big fan of the aggression/war defense mechanisms, but they do what they intend to do: inject uncertainty to a player's decision to play aggression/war cards onto a weaker opponent. Those mechanisms just aren't very interesting (e.g., one player plays an aggression card and the other discards a card to neutralize it). The visual aspects of the game don't really convey a built civilization, though I'm more used to the civilization video games, which do a better job in that regard. Finally, downtime can be a beast. You will need a ton of plays before this plays smoothly. At 2 players it might not be too bad, but if you have 2 or 3 newer players for a 3 or 4 player session, downtime can be abysmal.

UPDATE [8.6.17] Rating downgrade (-.5) to 8.5.  This is an engine building game with a civilization theme.  The engine building is the gem of this game.  The civ theme is too tacked on for me when compared to a game like Antiquity where you truly seem to be building a civilization.

Long game but doesn't feel long (time passes fast). Not to Heavy after playing 1st game (played without wars or agressions). It took about 3 1/2 hours for the first game and maybe 2h45 for the second one. My wife has a lot a analysis paralysis on top of that! But I'm confident that we can play a game under 2h30-3h once we know the cards. The game is AWESOME. Lot of tough decisions to make. What I like the most is that it's not a race like a lot of games. You feel you have time to develop you civilization with carefull planning. You don't have to do all in one turn. Like Tom Vasel said in his review, you want to do everything and there are a lot a good decisions you can make. So far, one of my top games!

I hated this game! Incredibly overly complicated for complication sake. It was just everyone doing their own thing and then every once in a while interest would conflict and then more cards and back to doing your own thing. You know what sucked the most? The game length. I got up from the table and just quit somewhere around 3 hours. The rest of the group was far from done. Screw this game!

After first play:
Wow.  I knew I would like this game, and it didn't disappoint.  I loved the Civ computer games as a kid and this game scratches all of those itches.  It is so fun to see your civilization grow and the design of the player board is so smart.  Half way through the first play everything fell into place as far as managing your resources and food.  The only knock against this is the length, but it is worth it.

Easily the best game that I've played, and has so much replaybility built into it. I've introduced quite a few friends to it and like me, they have become hooked on this. Can't wait for the expansion cards and iPad version from CGE in 2017! 

Currently am playing it multiple times with mates online. Highly recommended if you are into strategy/civilization type, deep thinking game. Only (minor) downside is the steep learning curve, but once you learnt how to play, you will find it hard to stop playing.

It's been said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. well i won the last game where joan of arc built the taj mahal so learn from that. 
Have you ever wanted to play sid meiers civilization but didnt want to throw away the best years of your life hitting 'next turn'? Well this is the game for you. You'll be throwing away the best years of your life saying 'whose turn is it next?' instead since this game easily takes 5 hours. 
As explained, you'll be guiding your civ 'through the ages' haha im so sorry. you have to keep track of all the fiddly bits yourself without a comp to handle it. Admittedly my favorite part of the game is where you shuffle some of the greatest luminaries, leaders, and wonders mankind has known into the TRASH. Fuck you shakespeare. 'much ado about nothing' sums up your legacy pretty well. the only time anyone ever reads your hack garbage is in ap lit. bye napoleon you fuck. Wat-er-looser amirite? psh who needs a code of laws? eiffel tower? more like ei-full-of-itself tower. Would not recommend to small children. quite complex and long. children may choke on the small pieces..and on the historical inaccuracy of this game.

I played two games of this edition and 14 games of the older one. This one improves the older edition and the older edition was a nine for me. 
Downsides: It takes some time, but you can finish a 3 player game of Through the ages in a little bit less then 3 hours, if everyone knows the game and playes fast, but without rushing it. There is no catch-up mechanism, but in a game like this I don't want one. Its brutal, but hey its politics and empire building.
Positive: Great engine builder. The engine has multiple aspects and you really can build it over a large amount of turns. The new card set is better balanced. The interaction is indirect, fair, but brutal (great). The amount of luck was reduced in the new version.

The longest and, arguably, most complex game that I truly love.  Building up your civilization is a unique experience each time.  And unlike most civilization games, it isn't primarily about combat.  Nevertheless, it is unwise to ignore military.

Great Game. The only reason it does not get a 10 is that you need to set aside 2-3 sessions to play; our group is normally 5-6 people so conditions have to be just right for this terrific game. Playing for 6 - 8 hours or more is worth the time investment. Once you get the idea down as to relationships between food/resources/workers etc. you have a much better idea as to how and what cards you should go after. So many different strategies as to how to build your civilization that this has a lot of replay value. We may not get to play it often, but when we do, we will invest 8 hours and it will be a great deal of fun.

This game seems more fitting for a person that likes to build up and use a military to conquer the world (or your opponent). Even in a peaceful game (no war or aggression) if your military is not a large part of your point generating engine, you will get left behind. 
It is still a great game and deserves the high rating it has.

It has a very comprehensive learn-to-play book.  You will almost forget the definition of "time" while playing this game as your mind fills with strategies, planning and calculation. The game runs pretty smooth that you barely have to look up the rulebook again once you know how to play. The theme is there, every single card reminds you the history. I would recommend it for those heavy Euro gamers that are looking for a serious gaming night...

Ez egy jó játék, igazán jó. Egyetlen egy gondom van vele, hogy hosszú, de egy órával ezt be lehet korlátozni. Méltán megérdemli a helyezését. Ezt az új verziót próbáltam ki és elég mérges vagyok a kiadóra, hogy nem adott egy csere készletet azoknak bizonyos összegért, amit be tudnának illeszteni a drágán megvett játékukba. EZért én nem fogm megvenni az új kiadást. Egyébként meg mindenki odáig van a grafikáért, ami tényleg nagyon szép és hangulatos. De nem érzem annyira jónak, hogy ezért lecserélje az ember a régi verzióját. A kis fakorongok a régiben egyértelműbben jobbak mint a a mostani igénytelen műanyagok. Csak ajánlani tudom ezt a játékot!

This game is super difficult in every aspect. I think it is actually the heaviest game I have in my collection (I didn't play Food Chain Magnate). But it feels great to build strong civilization that is super hard to do. Game is brain burning, it takes much about 4 hours and doesn't forgive even smallest mistake. For some players it can be very frustrating. It has very strong negative interaction between players if You're not playing with peaceful mode (ruthless wars and aggression cards). You really feel like a creator of something big, You feel presure, You just can't make bad decisions in this game. I've played this game with 2 other players (5 hours) and now I know that I will not play it again with more than 2 players. Downtime between turns was killing me. I don't think that small luck factor (card drafting & events) is a problem in this game. Overall one of the best games I've ever played. Worth every penny. After 3 hours the best startegy wins the whole game.

After having played the original TtA, I'm now no longer interested in this. I really appreciate the depth, but for me it was a fun-free experience. I'm not a fan of bookkeeping games. Especially a civ game. Thus far, Clash of Cultures is the best 'style' of civ for me. Just the right mix of euro, map, and game length. I'm glad TtA exists for those who enjoy it. For me, there are 18xx ways for me to spend that time.

5x5 2017.  The game is basically about managing and balancing a bunch of currencies- food, resources, science, happiness, military, and of course your population/workers.  All these interact in various ways and a it's complicated enough that managing it all is pretty interesting.  The theme comes through somewhat, although maybe not as much as I'd like, and it is fun building your civilization from antiquity through to modern times.  Although I can't help but feel like you're really doing the same stuff throughout the whole game- the numbers on the cards just get bigger.  And this is a really long game- with inexperienced players this is an all day epic.  The military deck, and the military aspect in general, is nasty but makes the game much more interesting and tense, otherwise this is multiplayer solitare.  But even with those criticisms, this is a pretty great civ game and that's no small feat.

The only reason I'm not rating Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization an immediate 10 is for the same reason its predecessor isn't a 10... getting them played face to face. I got Amanda to play this with me and, for the first time in forever, she did really well. Although I won in the end, she was ahead on culture till Age IV and then lost on a tiebreak for Impact of Science. Incredibly close game and I'm hopeful for more face to face plays.

Everything about this new edition is great. I love the cubes instead of the disks. I love the insert. The cards seem like they'll be ok although I'm still waffling on sleeving them. The player boards are a bit thin, but not too bad. The track boards are all great. The rules answered all of my questions (more exactly things I forgot) and I think it'll be a good reference once people know the game. My copy is missing the playbook which I'll acquire at some point on the very off chance that I ever choose to sell it.

The changes to gameplay all seem positive. I like the shared tactic concept although it does ease the tension of getting tactics cards (good and bad). On the other hand, limiting defense cards to the number of military actions is great and avoids people just getting lucky draws. On the other hand, being able to discard any military card for one defense makes it a little easier to get parity (a good thing in Age A/I). As far as the production/corruption switch, I see nothing but positives. Amanda had bronze all game (till she got Oil) and never had a corruption issue. Not a strategy I'd recommend but she (almost) pulled it off. 

Finally, the cards are also nerfed just enough that I kept making mistakes assuming I knew what things cost and what they did and only realizing too late that I was wrong. I'll get over it quickly, but in the meantime, I actually like it. 

Super happy I've got the new edition (and the old one) and this will probably be new release GotY.

Awesome version of the original, which I had only played once. Although we played a 6-hr, 4-player game, I could play again tomorrow. This game has incredibly deep strategic options, while still remaining streamlined in core concept. The buildings and other various cards chain nicely off each other, without mandating that you have an intimate knowledge of all the cards in the deck to have a viable strategy. The wars offer a great amount of player interaction without things coming anywhere near Ameritrash. Overall just an awesome game.

I've only played with 4 players, and definitely want to try out a 3-player game at some point. Can't wait to play again.

TtA is one of my favorite games (top 5) and one of my most-played games, although most of those plays have been online. I miss the early aggressions and some of the leaders from the original, but overall this new edition feels more balanced. That said, it really needs an expansion with more leaders and wonders to keep the game fresh.

Even better than the original! The art upgrade, though superficial, greatly enhances the game experience, and I like the changes that have been made: corruption is evaluated before production, so it's much easier to calculate, and I like how you can now copy other players' tactics. I'm unsure about no longer being able to sacrifice units, though, which was an important way to win aggressions (especially if you were behind in military). 

It's still the definitive Civ experience in a board game: tough, tight, epic, and eminently replayable. Vlaada at the top of his game.

Have played it multiple times online, but only twice in real life.

2p is very different from 4p as I'm sure 3p will be as well. Still getting my ass kicked in 4p online games. The game to me is all about balance. and once you figure out the rough balance of the game, you have to watch other players and figure out how to block, etc. The general rule of not taking cards for additional actions doesn't really ring true with experienced players.

Great great game. I can imagine it will be a beast to play live with more than 2p though.

Takes a really long time to learn and teach all the little nuances and rules.  The playtime will be approximately an hour for each player plus 1.  It'll be a lot longer if the players take awhile thinking of their next couple of moves.  For a 2-player game, it would be about a 4-hour game.  If you don't mind the time it takes to set up, teach, and play the game and you like civilization-type games, this is a buy for you.  Otherwise, there are other games that will provide you with the civilization aspect but with a lot less time.

After the four-person introductory game I say, meh. The different cards are interesting, but I never felt I was actually building something. Had this same feeling with Nations, so maybe I just don't like civ games. I'll give this is another try if someone suggests it before I trade it away.

RATING: 10
My rating is a little deceptive because TTA as a tabletop experience has enough serious flaws that I'm really reticent to bring it out. The amount of downtime between turns can be lethal, and it's a bear to teach. But as an asynchronous game online, I find the experience satisfying. My play count for this game is deceptive since I play it much more often online and I don't track async online plays.

Deep, deep heavy civilization game.  It is a really good game, but I think that I like Nations better.  I would play this again if someone else suggested it, but I won't necessarily say "hey, let's play Through the Ages."

Update:  I did play again.  And although I liked the game, the 4+ hour time commitment was just a bit too much for me - especially when starting at 9PM.  BUT - I love this game on my iPad.  It plays fast, and the computer does all of the fantastic mathy and maintenance stuff lickety-split!  So, I think I would probably rate this game higher if all that crap was done faster during game play.

I've only been playing this one online so far, mostly as a two player game. The modest tweaks between this and the base game are across the board good improvements.

It's still pretty much the same game, and I do like it a good bit with online play. I wouldn't want to be a new person trying to tackle this at a table of seasoned players, but if the players are balanced, this is a good, engaging challenge. 

After about 10+ plays, this game desperately needs an expansion to introduce some variety.

My feelings about TTA 2.0, in the form of a catechism:

[q]What is different in the new edition? Basically, a bunch of cards you never gave a second thought to in the first edition are now worth buying, and a couple of tweaks were made to the military side that makes that aspect of the game a little less exclusively decisive. The form factor has gone from spartan to pleasantly humdrum.
Is the new edition better than the old one? Yes.
Is the new edition so much better than the old one that the old one is now worthless? No.
Have I, personally, felt like it's worth it to get the new edition? No.
Why is that? Because I only play TTA face to face once or twice a year.
If I played TTA face to face, say, six or seven times a year with a regular group, would I upgrade? Yes, probably, assuming I had the money.
Would getting the new version be my first priority assuming I had the money, vis-a-vis the other things on my wish list? No.
If I had the choice between the new or the old edition, would I play the new edition exclusively? Yes.
Will I get the app version for iOS when it comes out? Almost certainly.[/q]

This is currently my favorite game in my collection. The components are very high qualify. There are a multitude of strategies and tech paths to follow, each of which is a viable method for victory. The box is designed to store components very well with a separate compartment for each piece piece and spaces for each board at the top. It plays well at all player counts, although a 4 player game can sometimes drag on if one of the players is going slow.  The game can last over 3 hours pretty easily so don't try to play it if you have somewhere to be. Overall, I adore this game!

A game plagued by long downtimes and constant cube accounting, yet a smooth as butter game that confronts you with simple yet always tense decisions. As fresh as it has been when it first came out, almost 10 years ago, and as exciting. The mechanisms are well-tuned, the art now is serviceable, even good, the components are very good indeed. 

An overall excellent game, and one I wish that it hits the game often. Two things that one needs to be mindful of: a) you need to find partners that wish to explore this game, as card and pitfall knowledge is necessary for enjoyment, b) you need to be appreciative of "procedural" games, as this game feels like a constant ledger manipulation. In a short of charming way, but still it does. 

I am unsure whether a better design that builds on this one comes along soon. This has not been Nations, or Patchistory or any other latecomer so far, but it is not out of the question that such a better design will come along soon, the grandiosity of the subject almost mandates it.

A well balanced, mature yet guilty pleasure. This new edition brings it up a notch and gives it a sharper edge needed to still sign today.

2-4 Best with 3
Amazing game. Only downside is how long it takes (around six hours for our group of four, much less if you play online through the app) but still and definitely our favourite game. Best brain burner! 

We do miss the map aspect that other games have (Sid Meier's Civ, Clash of Cultures) but none of them feels as balanced.In Through the Ages, the player that played best almost ALWAYS wins.

/edit 
After many plays we realised that once all players get to know the game well and perfect their strategy, the luck of the card draw (i.e. the sequence in which cards open) most times becomes a deciding factor in winning or losing. We need to give this game some rest and see it again with fresh eyes.

RATING: 7.5
The empire-building is very neat, and there's no doubt I enjoy this game. A few things hold it back from really soaring in my esteem, though. One is the classic issue of analysis paralysis. This game really suffers from it, and it makes for some slow turns. Another is that there's a bunch of fiddly little rules. You have to keep going back to the rulebook, and finding answers there isn't always easy. Finally, the sheer amount of bookkeeping required is a turn-off, especially in the end-game, where the rulebook isn't precisely clear on how everything gets tallied up. Here's where the app version would likely make the game a lot more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game.  Moderate learning curve and can take a few hours to play but always fun.  Plenty of paths to victory and you need to take a long-term view.  Naval technologies aren't included, except for the abstracted colonisation element.  That's a big gap from a history perspective but doesn't detract from the core of the game.  Highly recommend.

RATING: N/A
(Mildly interested in this based on the lowered emphasis on the military, but I'm leery based on reports that the leaders have been balanced out; unequal power cards is kind of critical for a game like this as it creates tension. Willing to try, probably not willing to buy first).

A masterpiece, TTA is one of the best games ever made. The only thing holding this back is that it's difficult to get to the table due to the games length and complexity. Works amazingly at 2/3 players, 4 causes a bit too much downtime.

The original TTA is a near perfect game. I have played 100 over games online as well as in league format with my friends. Till date, i still love every game of TTA.

the New TTA fixed whatever small balance issue that existed in the original. If the original was an easy 10, this is easily a 12.

The no sacrifice, discard for defence and simplified corruption are so good in improving the pacing of the game. simply love it.

now i just have to find a way to convert my original to this new version!

Really enjoyable game of preplanning turns, and juggling resources.

First play, full 4-player game, with all new players involved.  Took over 3 hours to get part way through Age II (with a number of breaks dotted in, and rule checking).  Definitely want to play again when we have more time.  Likely to try and stick to 2/3 player games when time is limited.

*Update* played a full 4 player game, took nearly 6 hours to complete!  Won't look to play with full count unless all are familiar with the game, and players aren't prone to AP.  Seems that 3 players is the sweet spot.

First off, this game isn't bad, it's just too big for my tastes. The rules management alone makes it a more of a tedious than fun game. I've come to find the main reason I play board games is to engage, compete, and problem solve with the people I know. And when rules and scopes of games become too large, I tend to end up lording over them like some sort of bureaucratic figure with my book of rules explaining what one can and cannot do. The simplicity is lost, and the focus is on the boundaries. Many tabletops overcome this with lateral thinking, however this game feels trapped within it's scope.

The strategy doesn't seem well balanced either, military being a pathway that once you're ahead, you stay ahead. I imagine that a game this large can't truly be play tested much. Far too many variables.

This is a Game with a big G. I totally love playing this. Deep thinky game with a lot of decision trees and a huge amount of strategies. You can feel like you are real leader of some tribe leading it through the ages. Economics works here brilliantly and everything is just perfect.

What I like:
- lots of strategy and tactics involved
- different paths to victory
- simplistic design (no map), just player board with some cubes and cards, yet one of the deepest games I have played
- theme

What I dislike:
- Took a lot of time to play this, I would like to play it much often but the time dedication is limited.
- The downtime could be very high in 3+ inexperienced players 
- Lack of solid solitaire mode (some kind of automa)

Definitely more streamlined than the previous edition. Leaders and wonders are more balanced and it seems the game is open for expansion too. The only complaint is it's hard to teach and hard to find players. But for a game of this size, the enjoyment is at least in line with the enjoyment.

Interesting game, with a long play time - which is going to be problematic getting this one back to the table. You have to have military and be in step with your opponent. Lots of things to manage with limited resources and actions. Tough calls to make early in the game. Is Nations not perhaps a thematically a better experience? The game is going to give stronger military players an advantage to pommel weaker military players in the third age ...

I would recommend this game to those who have the time to learn a game that rewards you and your players through hard work! The rule books are MEATY and there is a lot to digest, but once you do, you're laughing. There is an awful lot going on in this game and resource managing enthusiasts are going to love this. You need to strike a delicate balance to be successful, as everything is just as important as everything else. Be prepared for your first couple of games to last around 6 hours as you learn, but stay with it, it's a gem.

Liked the original, but this is a big improvement.  It doesn't feel as if military is nearly the dominant thing it was before, and the graphic presentation is much nicer. I very much enjoy the game, but the length and the fiddliness of tracking food, population and resources detract from the experience. A once or twice a year kind of game, but fun. Curious about the upcoming expansions.

Update: the app is very well done, and may kill face to face games for me. A game that’s as long and fiddly as this just doesn’t get to the table much, but asynchronous play over several days, with the app making sure no one messes up their bookkeeping, is the way to go. It even makes four player games feasible.

I try to keep my collection as small and varied as possible.  I don't have the space for every game ever made.  I like to have the best of each genre in my collection.  So I am going into this review of Through the Ages heavily biased towards not wanting to replace or duplicate the Sid Meier's Civilization (plus both expansions) slot.  And yet here we are.  Unlike Sid Meier's, there is no map here to explore and conquer.  Yet it's sitting at #2 on the BGG list, compared to Sid's at #137.  What gives?

Well, what a tremendous game!

One can really feel as if he was setting the fundations of a civilization and making it´s future development. Establishing the ways to gather resources, the form of government (with different features between them), the ways to expand science to further enhance culture (the aim of the game)...
The buildings, the equipments and the historic personalties that are presented to be picked up by the players are very thematic and come at the right "age" of time (that is antiquity, medieval, modern age, etc) and the personalties reproduce their historical role.
Through the Ages is a breathtaking experience though beeing, at same time, very demanding and heavy, with lots of AP, beeing virtually impossible the introdution of the game to people which are not gamers.

RATING: 8
As a big fan of the original game, I was skeptical about the new version. However, after playing it, I feel they've done a great job of streamlining parts and fixing some of the leaders' abilities. The new components are excellent, as are the end-of-turn changes. New events are also very interesting. I traded my old version, as this replaces it in every way. That being said, I've played the game (old version mostly) so many times, I'm a little burned out on it. I still think it's a great game, but I'd almost always rather play Clash of Cultures, nowadays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Pros:
- Highly replayable
- Tight resource management and card drafting game.
- Balancing actions and resources on each turn is very satisfying.
- Forward planning very important unless your civilization suffers from imbalance.

This edition further refines previous editions and streamlines the end of turn process for players. Really a gamer's game where civilization is abstracted but well represented by the different actions and resources you can juggle. Great components, artwork, and graphic design.

Cons:
- Steep learning curve and game play flow takes getting used to.
- Level of abstraction has to be learned and bookkeeping can be easily missed and mess up a session.
- Punishing game when military options are used against players but luckily has surrender/resign option.
- Minimum an hour per player, longer with newbies. Ironically feels like it ends too quickly in the latter half of the game despite everyone having more actions and longer turns since end game comes abruptly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Impeccably balanced game that simulates the feeling of playing Civilization without the giant parameter space.

In theory one could say the game runs a bit long but the game's rubber-banding mechanisms keep it close without being unfair, and hence it stays engaging throughout.

Above all this game rewards adaptability. Unlike some of the other greats in the Euro strategy arena, this one can't be decided by an early-game killer gambit. The adept player can always find a way to steal the game late.

I have only played the digital version, so I don't count the plays.

This game is fucking amazing.  You take the best parts of 7 Wonders, add engine building, and seamlessly integrate an auction based military system.  This game is awesome with any number of players, with four being my favourite, although I imagine it would take a hell of a long time to play in person.

One gripe, occasionally you don't draw the right military cards and you get seriously fucked over.  You can usually plan for this, but sometimes your planning doesn't pay off and you don't get a war or a tactics card that you need.  I'm stretching here though, you should definitely play this game.

(Note: This rating is for the two player game. I haven't tried any other player count and I'm not sure that I want).

Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization (TtA) is a long, fiddly game with quite a lot of negative player interaction. All ingredients that I normally don't like in my games. But strangely, I do really enjoy TtA. For everything that I despise in TtA there is something that in the design that makes up for it. The clever idea of letting the players seed the events, the sense of achievement when you make a long term plan work and most of all, the satisfying feeling of managing your own civilization through the ups and downs of time. It just feels wonderful.

Now, one thing you have to keep in mind is that you need a dedicated opponent to get the full enjoyment from this game. The first few games are needed to get the card interactions and rules down. It's after that point that you can really begin to discover the depths of this wonderful game.

Another thing: I can't really comment on which version is better since it has been years since I've played the old one. One thing I do like better about the new version is the fact that there aren't different play modes (beginner, intermediate and expert). There is only one set of rules, which prevents some of the confusion that I've always had in the old version.

Why is Nations rated so highly? People say it isn't a ripoff but in the first place, it is, and in the second place TTA is far, far better. 

Nations is like Rod Stewart covering Zeppelin.

edit: It is better than the god-awful steaming turd Nations, but in it's own way it's almost as painful. After 4 plays I dislike this for the same reason that I dislike Dungeon Petz, Galaxy Trucker, Space Alert, and especially Mage Knight.

I own and have played the first edition several times but this edition is much easier to learn and play. Huge improvement in all aspects.

Even though the playtime is long the game is engaging all the way, sure some people might get some super combinations and so on but the game is fun anyway. The wars and aggressions forces you to keep up military which is good. You can skip it altogether of course but it will cost you.

Don't play with slow players though and don't play with four. There is downtime (even though it can be easily mitigated by allowing the next player to start while the first one is doing production and so on).

Just an awesome game.  Even better than the original.  Military races can still occur, but that's supposed to happen in Civ games.  See my review of the original and then understand that this fixes some of the minor issues.  The worthless leaders are fixed.  Need more plays to determine if there are still any overpowered ones. I'd still remove "Classic Army" tactics from the Age II military deck.  But now instead of one person being the lucky recipient, everyone will get it.  So better, but not perfect.  I'll play this one any time!

Lovely new edition of Through The Ages, that instantly replaces my old well played CBG edition from nearly a decade ago.  The components have been given a dramatic upgrade, and the mechanics overhauled to give a smoother feel to the game play. 

Still one of the best games of all time.

RATING: 9
After over a dozen plays of this game, I definitely consider this game to have some of the best elements of any game that I own. Every game represents a variable order of cards, and as a result, the game changes every time I play it. Admittedly, although you can pick up the order and mechanics of the game quite quickly, learning and applying an effective strategy takes a much more concerted effort, and honestly, I suck at it, but I would play this game any day of the week with 2 or 3, and never ever with four because of the amount of lag and AP that players have to endure at 4 players.

So far I have played two times through the iPad version's long, beefy but excellent tutorial. Background: I love Civ games, and Civ 2 was my favorite game growing up. However, I suck at long-term strategy. Yet I keep coming back for more. This explains my love-hate relationship with TTA: ANSOC; I love it, I want to keep playing it, yet I also keep losing every time I play. I haven't yet managed to defeat the AI on Easy. Also, I'm intimidated by all the moving parts and bookkeeping (another thing I suck at) in the physical copy. I think I prefer the streamlined experience of the iOS version, which does a lot of the bookkeeping for you. Also, the iOS version is among the best digital versions of a board game that I have ever played.

I think this is the same game as [gameid=25613] (just a newer version).  

I love that game though, and it is one of the few games post 1995 I rate a 10.  This made some good minor changes that I think make the game a little better like any new version should, and 

Definitely in my Top 10 games.

Since I think this is just a newer version of [gameid=25613], I record plays of this as an expansion.

RATING: 9
While not drastically different from the first edition, everything here is a little bit better.   Or, in some cases, a lot of bit better - the graphics, the UI, the score tracks, the military system.   Many cards have been tweaked.   But, it is still the same game essentially.   So, this kind of obsoletes the first version (all editions).

I'm fully enamored with this game. There is so much to sink your teeth into. Replay value is through the roof. Once the rules are out of the way this becomes a blissfully enjoyable game. It's amazing how the game crecendos from relaxing in the beginning to absolute madness and tension towards the end. The game feels like a trip and I love it.

I call this "Civilization in a box" (yes, I'm stealing this from Tom Vasil xD ).
That's the kind of experience you'll get. One of the two best games from Vlaada Cvàtil (I love you Mage Knight).
Suggested for two players. More than that and it becomes so long that it's almost impossible to get the chance to bring it to the table (I do actually, I mean for the average person. Me and my friends are insane).
Start from antiquity, meet great philosophers and warlords, commit to discoveries and science, grow your civilization and evolve..
Deep and satisfying. Many of today's popular board games mechanics were invented here. You have to be fond of complex games, or it can be too much to handle xD

Dollars-to-play value is unmatched.  This game is possibly one of the very best you can put on your table so long as you are willing to spend the hours on it.  I wouldn't recommend any higher than 3p if you want to keep your sanity, but it can be done.  The improvements over the first edition are subtle yet very, very effective.  A lot of annoyances have been addressed.  If it's been some time since you played the original, you might not remember or even be able to point out specifically what the changes are, but overall, you will find that it [i]feels[/i] better.  The flow is vastly improved by some small changes to the gameplay pipeline and it's a world of difference.  The importance of military is still there, but the race is far different this time around and though you will have to beef up your defenses, you can win (as I did) without participating full-force in the arms race.  

Repeated play will make you a much more effective player as end-game scoring can feel swingy if you can't remember the cards.  A simple player aid of possible end-game cards would have gone a long way to making TtA2 a lot friendlier for newbs.  That being said, there's nothing stopping you from grabbing a few cue cards and just making your own player aids.

Thoughts after 2 plays: a 3 player short game and 4 player full game.

The game play (e.g. managing population/resources/science/happiness buying and playing technologies, etc.) is really enjoyable, among the best games I've played. If my rating was on that alone it would be a 9, but a couple of things knock it down a bit:

- Fiddly - probably the most fiddly game I've played, in fact, I think our final scores were only approximations... perhaps within a 10% error. Too many cubes and totals to track... can't see playing this without making some mistakes
- End game scoring - there's some randomness during the game, due to card draw and actions of players, but I think it's fine, what bothered me with the full game is the bonus scoring at game end... perhaps (maybe even likely) we played bad, but there were so many bonus cards scored at the end (at least 10) that it degenerated into a point salad type of experience; the # of bonus points scored was 1/3 to 1/2 of total points... I prefer the short game where the bonus are visible at the beginning
- Military - still seems very strong... we had one player, effectively knocked out of the game within the first hour and had to sit through the next 5... granted, he could have taken the "Retire" political option, but that's not how we roll. I'm not a "care bear" player, but there's a bit more conflict that I would like to see in a "strategy" game.
- Length - the game is really long... but this isn't that big of a deal...

Overall, I'll rank this an 8. After my first play I had this above Clash of Cultures, but now that I got a second play in, I'm not so sure... they seem fairly equal... and I would play CoC with 4 players, TTA at 2 and flip a coin for 3.

Through the Ages is mainly a game about balancing your workforce, military might, science, victory points, population, happiness, resources, food and two kinds of action points. Sound like a lot? It is and that's not even all of it. Not only do you need to manage the above, but you need keep your technology that revolves around these aspects current or risk falling behind. I found the above a little tedious especially with the large amount of bookkeeping that needs to be done throughout the game. It also felt like there had to be a little too much effort put into military. This is surprising considering that it's been toned down, compared to the previous edition. That said, the leaders, wonders, and managing/dealing with the various events keep things interesting.

In the end, Through the Ages takes ages to play. Therefore it's not a great game for me to to keep in my collection. I think when the app comes out it would be a decent game to play digitally, so all of the book keeping is automated.

Despite being an incredibly long affair, Through the Ages remains accessible. The mechanics are simple and clear, but the implications and interactions of the various mechanics make this game difficult to wield. Balancing military, population growth, and corruption, with the ultimate goal of maximizing culture is incredibly difficult, though equally satisfying. TtA is a game I strive to master, but with each game lasting an hour or so per player, improvement is an epic grind.

I enjoy the process of playing this game.  I'm not as sure from a competitive standpoint..., owing mainly to the ability of one player (regardless of which it is) to develop resources at a rate greater than another based essentially on the luck of the draw as cards become available). I'd already own this game if the box was a standard size - the 12.4" for example (it could be thicker to accommodate the added components, like Orleans Dlx).  

I really don't mind the length as it takes time to implement strategies and I use the down time to plan my next actions so it moves along pretty quickly.  With regard to the run-away leader issue, it does seem you can know what to do but just be unable to do it - even if you're willing to adjust your strategy.  You also may need to play a relatively aggressive game as not doing so will disadvantage your relative position. 
One note - the icons are not clear as to when you increase your rate of earning points vs earning points directly on a few of the tracks.

Updated version of [gameid=25613].  Improves:
1. The rules 
2. The balance of the cards 
3. The military system 
4. The artwork 

The bottom line: "Despite being a decade old, Through the Ages is an outstanding game of the modern era that can hold its own besides the best games appearing on the market today. A New Story of Civilization takes this winning formula and refines it with improved rules, better balance, welcome adjustments to the military, and an artwork makeover, to make it even better. As a civilization game, this new reimplementation of Through the Ages does an outstanding job of evoking a real sense of theme (despite the absence of a map); it has to be considered the apex of the civ-game genre right now, standing head and shoulders above most of the competition, with few games coming anywhere close to matching it. The need to cross the threshold of a relatively high level of complexity and game time will inhibit some, but those who aren't daunted by the prospect of investing some time into learning and playing this game will find themselves richly rewarded."

Only one game of the new version so far but I like what I see. I’m not one of these TtA experts – but, hey, I’ve read their threads – and many cards seem to be buffed up such that they’re more interesting. I welcome the idea of stronger yellow cards to supplement production and boost you through lean times and more interesting techs such that card decisions are even more fun. 

The de-emphasis of military is particularly good. Before the game felt like it fell into a battle between the guy who jumped out to a huge culture lead and the guy who bided his time building military so he could wage war and steal that culture at the end. The way you would sacrifice units often resulted in Pyrrhic victories.

That’s fine if you like that sort of dynamic but I prefer the new one -- you build a culture engine and a capable military to defend yourself and find ways to outdo the other players. No more end of game VP see-sawing and no more sacrificing of units –this is easily the best improvement in the game.

TTA is a game that demands your attention and repeat plays to truly play well.  It certainly is one of the better board games in the genre that I've played.  It's a pity that I don't have the desire to commit the time to it to get the most out of it.

We used 5 hours (!) on the first game with 3 players. That's too long for me. I can see that we may cut the time by 1-2 hours after repeated plays. It's very satisfying to play this engine builder. And the theme is implemented solidly. Especially, I like that you cannot avoid the military track. That creates a lot of good tension. However, the text on the cards aren't always clear, and we were forced to look up in the rules and check bgg several time (without succeeding finding the answers some times). I wished they had also been more thorough with the card text. That would have saved us some time. Anyway, a good experience, and I will play again. Rating might go up.

The balance tweaks are thorough, subtle, and much improved; I never really liked how military worked in the original game.  Every card seems valuable now given the right circumstances.  I cannot think of a modern game that has had as much data (through BGO) to look at and make balance tweaks than this game.  The overall graphic design and art in the game is also drastically improved; this is visually a beautiful game now, which certainly could not be said for the original.  This is a special game and certainly on the short list of the most prized games in my collection.

This is a great game and a lot of fun to play.  A very thought provoking game.  I have only played it 2 player so far and would really like to try 3 and 4 player.  Down sides are that the game is very long so if you don't enjoy long games I would pass on this game.  My second issue is that the game can become very one sided because their is no good way to catch up your military if u fall way behind.

Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization was one of my all-time favorite board games... Now, this is my favorite one, period. 

I love the new graphic design and consider that all its components have been improved. Most important: more than a half of the cards have been changed drastically, or at least tweaked, in order to provide a more balanced game experience. Moreover, all the rule changes make perfect sense and help "cleaning" the game system. 

I still consider the playing time as its biggest issue, though, because, even loving this wonderful game as much as I do, it makes pretty difficult to get this gem to the table. 
---

Extract from my previous comments on Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization:

Advice! This game is really tough and heavy! A "serious gamers game", in the, yes, questionable sense of the word. Definitely not the kind of game for casual gamers (in fact, this game represents the antithesis of the concept "casual gamer's game").

I'm absolutely in love with this "built a civilization" themed game.  Brilliant mechanics. Perfect balance between choices-risks. Very small luck factor involved here: the game result will rest on your desitions, never on a bad card drawing or something like that.
Perhaps the one and only problem I have with this game is its duration, 'cause it takes at least 4 -5 hours to finish a 3 or 4 players complete game (till the end of age III/beginning of age IV).

A masterpiece, a truly work of art in the world of board game design. My perfect 10.

Lowering my score to 8. Still an amazing design but several problems keep it from going higher:
- Military is crucial, to the point where it cannot be ignored. The player who does not keep up is basically at the mercy of the card draws, hoping the guy with the big army doesn't draw any wars. Which brings the next argument.
- All the might in the world can't help if you don't draw a single war, which can happen quite often. This makes the military strategy highly volatile. I'm not a big fan of success/failure depending on random draws.
- Runaway leader. There aren't any catch-up mechanics in place to stop someone once they get a good lead. It's pretty obvious who's going to win from very early stage of the game.
- Death spiral, especially related to military. Once you get stomped, there are very few resources left, so chances are you will be stomped again next turn, with little to do to defend, especially against wars.
- Some cards are clearly less useful than others, which funnels the game into repeating the same strategy over and over again.

Boring, way too hard to keep track. Way too hard to keep track of your opponent. People make mistakes constantly and don't get caught. Difficult to teach. Not enough interaction... just bad.

RATING: 10
This is by far one of the most interesting and fun building games I've ever played. From the get go you start of with this tiny civilization with spear and shield warriors, small farms, and mines. 

By the end you can be the civilization that invents space flight, the internet, and all sorts of marvels. You hire cool scientists and artists from Davinci to Albert Einstein, and even Bill Gates.

If you enjoy building games where you invent technologies, build wonders like the pyramids, and the Eiffel tower, and create vast armies, then this is the game for you.

The first play through, the starter book has you take out all the war and aggression cards, which I don't recommend. The main reason for the card removal is to make learning the game easier, but I felt without those cards it feels like the game is broken and building any military in the game feels useless. 

I followed the starter rules to the t the first play through, and let's just say the second play through, with the full rules, is where this game shined.

I was getting bullied by my sisters military in the first half, so toward the second half of the game I acquired more military technologies like modern marine footman and tanks. Then I let her feel the military might my civilization had attained!

I highly recommend if you like building games like Catan and worker games like Caverna/Agricola and if you don't mind long games. Expect about an hour per player your first play through, then as everyone learns to plan their turn on other player's turns, the play time shortens. 

You will also enjoy this game if having a powerful civilization that dominates others into signing beneficial pacts and treaties or destroying/pillaging ones that don't.

I don't recommend this game if your the type of person that only enjoys shorter simpler games, as this game is not short although you can use variants that shorten the game, like be done after age 2 like the starter book has you do. I really don't recommend shortening it though because you miss out on a lot of the really cool technologies, leaders, military stuff, and wonders.

One last thing to add. I'm starting to see a pattern in games that have Vlaada Chvatil's name on them, so far this is the third one I've owned and he's 3 for 3 with amazing games.

I like this game a lot, but I admit it is not for everyone. It is a very long game, even if you are familiar with it. Every decision matters and, of course, the players will want to make the best of their choices, thinking each one very much ahead, considering many possibilities, specially in a competitive environment. Because of it, the late game tends to be tiring.

Everything I love about the original game, but reducing the value of military/conflict - this opens up a cascade of strategies and (initially) appears to improve the game. Conflict and paying attention to military is still vital, but if playing correctly, that is closer to a cold war situation in most cases and not an all out battle.

Perhaps I've grown as a player since I tried this game years ago, or perhaps this newest edition really does fix the problems that I had with the first. But TtA is a great civilization game! I love games where you can watch the development happen before your eyes. The choices and decisions to make are plentiful and interesting. The competition stays high and the different routes to success all pose their strengths and problems if pursued. The idea that this game has been balanced by using data from thousands of online games is intriguing, and the balance of options can really be felt.  The new artwork is excellent.  I'm still not a fan of the fiddlyness of moving the cubes around all the time, and honestly I would have liked maybe different shapes for resources vs. workers (as my brain still couldn't differentiate on colour differences alone) but I'm sure this cleans up with multiple plays.  Also, this is a looonnng game which isn't always my favourite thing, but I didn't find myself tired with TtA at all by the end.  It can get a bit messy by the end with extra actions available and resources and food, etc., but it is all manageable as long as you stay focused. Overall- an excellent game!

This is hands down the best Civ game.  If you like Civ games, and you for some wacky reason haven't tried this yet, turn off your electronic device and go do so right now.  There are myriad choices and strategies.  Materials are critical but you don't spend the game Agricola.  Sorry, I meant starving.  We played the beginner version (in which you play 3 of 4 ages) and for two players who never played before, including putting stickers on pieces, the game was 3.5 hours.  So, keep that in mind.  Playing the advanced version on our second playthough was about the same time frame.  That being said the full version of the game is far superior due to the interesting cards in the final age.  Even though the full game makes the end game scoring more random, I still enjoyed it because it feels like the players get to determine what cards/commodities/stats score.  Excellent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Captures the one more turn addictive game play of the great civilisation games. Initially you feel overwhelmed by choice and the synergy between cards can be quite opaque. With more play you begin to see the patterns in the early draft that can drive powerful strategies. Single cards which seemed over priced when you first begin to play start to be worth 3 actions as you see the longer term strategy they enable. Fantastic balance and engaging game play make this one of my favourites.

Two issues should be mentioned. This game should never be played with 4 players unless they are all experienced and quick in their play. Otherwise, it can be a tedious chore that over stays its welcome. I do enjoy the different feel in the pace of the card row and increased interactivity, but simply can't stomach the amount of down time and game length with this many players. 

The upkeep in this games is not insignificant and adds to the time it takes to play. This has really been driven home by the release of the app, where games that previously took 3 hours can now be complete in under an hour.

The app has basically killed any want to play this at the table again. But, that doesn't detract from this being one of the all time great board games, and it will have a permanent place in my collection.

Along with all the other glowing comments let me add this one: this game has, hands dow, the best rulebook I have ever seen.  The game is complex, but every step is spelled out with clear examples, exceptions to rules are listed, and an incredibly helpful "fist game" is programmed out.  My group all picked up this game de novo, yet every time we had a disagreement on what to do, the answer was right there.

It is undoubtedly a good game. A really good game. But our game lasted over 5 hours. I don't see any reason for this game to be this long. I honestly stopped having fun after the first 2 hours.

Gave one of my very few 10 ratings to the original version. Played a mock-up of a playtest version a couple times, and while the toned down military takes it down a notch in terms of tension, I enjoyed it greatly, and this may also earn a 10 once I've had a chance to give it a few plays (I don't rate anything a 10 without many plays).

Amazing game that also has a fantastic app you should buy if you like Through the Ages.  Great engine building game where you take YOUR civilization from antiquity to the modern age. The advancing card row mechanic is perfect and allows players to take and hate-take cards they or their opponents really need. Military means you always have to keep within close distance of other players or say goodbye to your hard earned resources/buildings.

It's a great game, but it's  too long. I like the engine you create and how every resource is scarce and important, so there's always something to work on and something you desperately need. I really appreciate the level of interaction between players. There's some direct conflict and there's competition for cards, but you don't feel like players are targeting you or ruining your engine, instead it's all about how much you develop your army. You need to be aware of other players and you're interested in their turns, but you don't have to keep track of all of their resources every turn.

My one problem with the game is that it's long. It's rewarding and interesting because of it  because you see your civilization grow and choices in the early game affects the rest of the game, but it's also hard to justify playing this over playing 2 other games in the same time.

Playing TTA was sort of like reading The Grapes of Wrath: I felt I should do it but I question whether it was a rewarding experience. The mechanics are sleek and impressive but I didn't find them compelling. Player interaction is low and what there is feels a bit random, like in the event deck, or a plain beat down, like in the aggressions. Finally, add to that 10-20 minute turns (my first game with four took 5 hours and we still didn't get through the last round or two of Age III before Joey's was closing) and I don't myself looking forward to another play of this. 

PROS
-Art & components are high caliber.
-Mechanics mesh well and it is cool how the resources work.
-Card abilities felt thematic.
-Seemingly good balance, at least after hearing the stories of the first edition.

This is really a great board game version of the PC game Civilization. I really love it, but it has two major flaws, which brings the rating down 1 point each: Too long and Too fiddly. The icons are unfortunately not so intuitive as I had wished. I've tried it just once with the full rules and 4-player. Probably is the game best with 2 players, but then you can't use the pact cards.

After playing it over 10 times, I increased the rating to 9. But I always avoid to play it with 4 (then I would rate it 6) and prefer playing it with 2, as the time is normally less than 3 hours.

This new 4th edition, is even better, so I sold the old version aftyer buying this.

Excellent civilization game!  I have not play Sid Meier Civilization video game since the 2nd edition but Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization really reminds me of it.  You have to balance your Food, Ressources, Science & Culture production.  You also need to built Military units and keep your civilization happy.
You need food to increase population and feed them.
You need population to work in buildings or become Military unit
You need Ressources to produce Military unit and build building
You need Science to develop better technologies
You need Military to get benefit from event instead of penalty.  You can also hurts other player if your Military is stronger.
You need Hapiness otherwise you won't produce
You also need Culture because the goal of the game is to have the most Culture point!
If you love game in which you have many options but not enough actions to do them all, this game is one of the best that I know!
The only 2 downside are:
- first time can't be played in a 3 hour game night (at least not with rules explanation)
- there will be alot of downtime with more than 2 player

Haven't played the original so much that I can comment this one with any sense of what I'm saying. This is a long, complex and deep game. One which you need many matches to get a hang of, and after that, maybe years to master. 

As for now I enjoy it somehow, not completely because the nuances are lost to me and I certainly don't feel the strong lacerating feelings of loss and desperation other games give me regarding decision making (say Paths of Glory, or even Race for the Galaxy), and that is probably only because the consequences of my decisions are not immediately apparent to me. As such I need to play more, waiting for the divine inspiration of insight to suddenly click with my perception system.

What can go wrong with war game without a map? In Through The Ages: A New Story of Civilization, nothing. The cards are balanced, tactical move decision every turns of the game, having to react to opponent's move accordingly. Theme is amazing even though it's just pictures on card. However, experienced player will always beat new player's ass, so recommended to play with same level player.

A good example of a good reimplementation. The old version is still one of the better games, but this one is better.

What holds me back not giving a 10? Allthough watered down in this new version, the game still has a major focus on military (with no alternative compared to for example  Nations where you have military vs stability). The other reason is that it is a long game, which isn't bad persé, but it takes commitment (maybe i just have commitment issues ;) ).

These aren't critisisms, but these make it not a game for everybody (and maybe only for the connaisseur?). It's an aquired taste.

A brilliant, deep, strategic civ builder, with a fantastic new design to boot. I love the myriad of things that need to be managed, balanced, and prioritised, culminating in an exceptional game experience. The only cons for me, personally, are (i) excessive game length (which limits how often this gets to the table), (ii) fiddlyness/bookkeeping element, (iii) downtime between turns, and (iv) the fact that it can get quite aggressive, as I'm typically a pacifist eurogamer.

*Update: the brilliant new app alleviates most of my above concerns by making the game wonderfully accessible and allowing for immersive solo play against AI. Fantastic work by the development team; app gets a 10/10 from me.

This edition resolved a lot of the issues I have with the original.  It is much better playtested for balance and there doesn't seem to be the opportunity for effective elimination anymore.  But it's still too long for me so I won't ever suggest it.  I will probably play again though.

Civilization building as a theme isn't probably my favorite (I've never been much into Sid Meier's Civilization or other games similar to that) but because of Through the Ages and its great reviews I've decided to give it and some other similar games a chance to impress me. I haven't played this yet, but I will, probably soon.

RATING: 9.5
This is very similar to original Through the Ages, but with updates components. There are small changes here and there with largest changes to combat. Also a small simplification of production phase. Overall it is still excellent game and with better components it is an improvement. Only downside is that it now takes more space and the box is bigger as well.

Need to play this again, and with 3 players instead of 4 due to game length issues.  Seems like a great game with complex decisionmaking, interesting trees of dependencies, and balancing.

Military plays a role, but is hardly the whole game.

As a family of 6 (4 kids, the wife and myself) we rarely can devote board game space to something that will have to sit for days (work and school obligations), BUT about twice a year we pull this out and go all in.  We are definitely on the upper end of the 240 minute playing time, and that could be due to the fact that we play about 90 mins at a stretch.  Love the design and mechanics.  When we finish a game (win or lose) we really feel like we have accomplished a lot.

I'm not sure this is sufficiently different from the original to be worth a separate game entry, ok art is more attractive and the cubes don't roll away. At least the temptation to constantly attack the weakest player has been toned down. However, the game is still far too long for one that requires so much micromanagement and it isn't even remotely fair or balanced. In the game that I played, one player became a runaway leader simply by getting Taj Mahal built early, by the time the rest of us were generating that many VPs it was far too late. Not a game I'll be seeking out again.

Una obra de ingeniería lúdica. Combina muchas mecánicas sin que el juego chirríe ya que hay una buena cantidad de conceptos en él bien integrados: felicidad, corrupción, revoluciones, colonización, conflictos militares, cultura, líderes destacados... Largo. Épico. Debería venir con dos tardes libres incluídas en la caja. Buena mecánica la de acciones civiles/militares (varían en función del tipo de gobierno), la construcción de maravillas (consumen muchos recursos) y la de los pactos entre civilizaciones (para que haya interacción entre ellos). Cada turno es un ejercicio de control y ajuste económico. Contras: muy largo, acojona al más pintado empollarse todas las reglas. No tiene mapa. No tiene árbol de tecnologías. Pierde mucho sólo con 2 jugadores, aunque gana en agilidad y acorta muchísimo su duración.

[ENG]

A real game-engeneering work. It combines a lot of different  mechanisms without a crunch during the game: happiness, corruption, revolutions, colonization, military conflicts, culture, leaders. Long and epic. It should have two free afternoons inside te box. Favourite mechanisms: civil/military actions (they are different based on the current goverment), the wonders (they need a lot of resources) and the pacts between two civilizations (they give the game much interaction). Every turn is a tough control exercise and economic adjust. CONS: Long. Too long. And the rules are long too!! There´s no map, no technologies´ tree. It´s no good just for two players, but is shorter and more agile than the 3-4 players´

Sid Meier would and should be proud.

RATING: 3
When I see this game at bgg's number 3 game of all time I really question my sanity and on the tastes of the people who rate games here. I'm not saying their tastes are bad but they skew towards a direction and a place not venture by many.

TtA: ANSoC is by far one of the most unfun, tedious games I have ever played and I say that as someone who enjoys heavy euros. The issue is that this game is needlessly repetitive, highly finicky with lots of moving parts and lasts over 3 hours with 3 players. The amount of downtime per player is astronomical as you get past Age I and the turns aren't even interesting if it isn't your turn. 90% of what your opponents do just don't keep me interested.

An engine building cutthroat game shouldn't be decided early in the first half of the game with 2 hours left, nor should it take so long without giving anything back. 

If you enjoy doing work and taxes and filling out information on forms this game is right for you.

If as a kid you enjoyed doing homework only to have it be deleted and need to start over again. If that pleases you by all means by this game.

RATING: 9
Can't complain about it (it [i]is[/i] Through the Ages after all) but let's just say I'll continue to log my plays of this under the original TTA entry.  Apart from the military changes, most of the new rules seem to be for the benefit of playing at the table and I am so far exclusively an online player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Suggest: Enthusiastic

Conclusion: yes, comments on the web are right, it beats old version in every aspect, but the game length and the downtime remain. 

The most important improvement is the brutal nature has been moderated(luck on tactic cards minimized, no-sacrifice allowed). Especially in 3-4p game, the changes make this game more [thing=126042][/thing]-like

The second, probably as much important as the 1st one, is that the function and numeric values of cards are modified: all the cards that apparently weak in old version are strengthened. 4-5 2p plays so far, I suspect some culture-point based strategies (Michelangelo, Shakespeare) are overpowered, but I'm not sure and that's really minor.

Third, the flow is improved by the new production rule and the re-make on yellow cards makes it more easy and less luck-based on developing. Fourth, the components and the artwork are much more better.

A very good game but I regret the history ends so soon without seeing too great modern armies, developed cultural/scientist infrastructure and some sc-fi robot mechs. The focus is on early times. Religion not too important in the 3rd era but why not? Just add three more cards - a religion-based cultural scoring event, a John Paul II leader maybe a building/wonder(Caritas?). 
And do a lot of IV era future stuff as an expansion. Until then: 8/10.

One of the best game, about civilization building with hand management and euroish style.

It has offers so much choices for play, so much strategies and things to done. Events are surprisingly beautiful, agressions are harmful but not a destroying one, them gameplay accomplish to being a civ-like game and taking it to the map. The choice of not putting a some map on it, actually becomes weird for the first time but when you discover the aspects of the game than you understand why there is no need a map.

After several plays with app and tabletop: Magnificent. Truely brilliant game. It offers very unique strategies in every game with such a beautiful design. It gets better with playing.

Simultaneously too long and complicated, and too shallow and superficial to be a true favorite of mine.

Yeah, maybe for veterans there are significant changes here. For me - not. It still feels very much like the original...
It's not necessarily bad (I rate the original at 8/10), but I felt much more of novelty with several mini-expansions than with this edition...
I'm yet to experience 'the improvement': weakened military strategy, more balance in the military area and rebalanced cards.

EDIT: I cannot truly master it even after 35+ plays (incl. its predecessor's (i.e. original edition's) ones).  Almost every time I feel unfulfilled – a mix of my non-perfect (yet not explainable why) play and seeing many parts of the game remaining unused (rare wars, rarely/never taken leaders/wonders/buildings…).  Also, many routine plays and worn-out roads don't help the replayability.

So it went for sale becoming the only game I rate at 8 and which I don't feel compelled to have in my collection.  I can surely play it, but the game is so frustrating (for me) that it has lost the right to reside on my shelf :)

Sold.

Still, when I do manage to get a game, usually at holidays, it's quite fun.

My initial impressions of Through The Ages are positive. In my first few plays of only the "short" game, the game's engine-building is both satisfying and frustratingly tense. There is plenty of Euro-style "I wan't to do it all but I can't" gameplay as well as some more thematic direct interaction. Though it does run a bit long and can have some downtime issues (especially with higher player counts), I have enjoyed playing it so far and look forward to eventually tackling the full game.

Mentally exhausting but fulfilling game for those who like to "solve puzzles" - gathering pieces to create an engine to generate the largest amount of points within a time that could run out faster than you expect and with other external "hinder antes".

Initial Rating: 10.0 (January 2016)

Through the Ages is my number two game of all time so I was very keen to try the new edition of the game. As usual, Vlaada Chvátil (perhaps my favorite game designer) doesn’t disappoint. The game is outstanding. TtA was also one of two games I rated a 10 (the other is Dungeon Twister) and this edition of the game, definitively, improves it a lot so I would rate it an 11 if I could.

First of all, the art is great and very superior to the previous edition. This edition comes with two game manuals and they are also superior to the previous ones. They are far easier to understand and to find info quickly on them.

The game´s core remains the same, so if you already know how to play, the changes can be explained under 5 minutes, otherwise the game is a complex one to teach, with lots of rules (but they make sense). The playtime continues to be high, there are some changes that speed up player´s turns (now you have to discard military cards after you end your turn), but not by much. With 4 new players the game can take near to the 4 hour mark. Due to this, I have always preferred to play the game as a 2 player game or with 3 fast players, otherwise the downtime is too much for me.

About the changes:

•	Besides the art, some cards were tweaked a bit for balance purpose. I approve. 
•	Corruption is easier to visualize because it is checked before production. This change also makes a lot of sense.
•	As I wrote before, now you discard excess military cards after you played your turn. This speed up the player’s turn because other player can begin playing while you are discarding, but it also helps you military wise because you have more options in your turn. On the same vein, drawing military cards is no longer part of production, so you can always draw all your military cards, even if your civilization is in an uprising.
•	Now, when you replace a leader you get a civil action back. This is a nice to have change.
•	The tactics now work very differently. This is one of the mayor changes to the rules (all previous changes were very tame). When a player plays a tactic card, it becomes available to all other players after one turn. This makes thematic sense (if you see how your opponents are fighting, you can learn from them) and helps a lot to downplay a bit the (previously all important) military aspect of the game. The player who plays the tactic card still have an advantage as he used the tactic first and other players need to pay more military actions to copy the tactic.
•	Another major change, players are no longer allowed to sacrifice units during aggressions. This is a great change to have because in the previous edition, the player who had the best military could decimate other players armies without weakening his position as the defender always had to sacrifice units to avoid damage. I love this. 
•	Another change I love (and one that makes sense and helps gameplay a lot), when you are defending you can use any military card you have for a +1 bonus. This also helps to prevent player´s military to become the most important facet of your civilization.

I like all the changes. TtA had some issues with the level power of the military. In the game manual, it said that TtA wasn’t a military game, but if you had poor military, most often than not, you will lose as stronger opponents would destroy all you built and steal your culture points. This is all fixed in this new edition. Here military is important, but not overpowering, so all of your civilization stats are equally important now. Having saying that, I liked how military worked in the previous edition as well, it was a source of tension and you were always aware of your opponents’ military rating, however all the games developed in this way.

The game continues to offer complex decisions, basically how to spend your civil and military actions, but you have many MANY options each turn (another reason I prefer it with 2 players). Each action has far reaching consequences. 

Bottom line, the new edition of the game makes a great game better. If you disliked the previous edition, there isn’t anything new here that will make you like this edition (unless you hated how the military worked in the past, if so check it again :D). This edition is an improved and rebalanced edition of my number two game of all time so I love it. It is Chvátil´s masterpiece and the best Civilization game on the market (even though it doesn’t have a map).

Wow what a Great game!  I wanted to give it 10, but the play time is just a bit too long. (and maybe I'll revisit my rating after playing some more) Also I have a love/hate relationship with the managing of resources/food/corruption.  It's a fun, tactile mechanic and I very much enjoy it, but I think it slows the game play down a bit and wonder if there could have been another mechanism to calculate faster.

This is a great game for replayability!  The card seeding mechanic allows players to write enough of the script to try and to position themselves to take advantage of events in the future.

I really look forward to being able to play this again - it made seven hours fly by!

This wasn't "love at first play" for me, but once it clicked, I was hooked. Yes, this is a long, complex, and fiddly game. Sure, there are thematic oddities that crop up periodically (Napoleon commanding an Air Force?!). And yes, some of the artwork is a bit on the cartoony/juvenile side. Even with these caveats, Through the Ages is a masterpiece. The array of decisions with which you are faced each turn captures the tension and angst of empire management like no other game I have played. There is *always* one more thing you'd like to do on your turn (several, actually), so you are constantly evaluating the opportunity costs and timing of your decisions. You won't be able to do everything you want to do, and this is always a mark of a well-designed game in my opinion. Nothing feels scripted, and sometimes any one of several choices will be a viable path forward. This is a definite brain burn, but well worth it.

RATING: 10
The best civilization game, period. Removing the map and simulating scarcity and opportunity through an ever-evolving parade of cards allows players to focus entirely on technology and development (engine-building), reducing chance by removing exploration and minimizing the impact of discovery. When TtA first came out, it completely redefined what a civilization game is and could be. I understand those who say they miss the map. I enjoy those games as well, but they present a different problem to solve, one with a bit less control. Through the Ages is a deeply strategic game built on the foundation of many, many small decisions. Because each decision supports a larger story arc, you have an incredible ability to change your trajectory based on circumstance and have your civilization grow in ways you may not have initially envisioned. The gradual building of your civilization, brick by brick and card by card, creates a level of investment that I have not seen achieved by any other game, much less any other civilization game.

This edition is better in every way than the original. The components are easier to handle and much more attractive. It includes a traditionally structured rulebook, the lack of which was the most disappointing aspect of the original version for me. The rules are excellently tweaked to balance the dominant strategies that have been discovered over the last decade.

I can appreciate the strengths of Through the Ages - the required strategic planning, the management of competing demands, the variability. The game has real depth of decisions and is a constant challenge for the best players. 

But there are two major drawbacks that will ever keep this from becoming a favourite. The first is the length of individual player turns. Towards the end, turns of five minutes are not unusual, even for players who are not suffering from AP. I can't imagine playing TtA with the full complement of four players. The second drawback is the focus on military. There are lots of developments to improve production, science and culture. None of them should be neglected completely but there are workarounds if you fall behind in of these areas. But military is a must. Falling behind in this area is a surefire way to the demise of civilization. Plundering and war will strike weaker civilizations, stealing culture (=VPs) directly and crippling the future potential.

These two drawbacks relegate TtA to a two-player game for me. Potentially three players as long as no hardcore optimizer with the knowledge of optimal military engines is a the table. The new version went some way to alleviate the worst military excesses of the original but military might still is the name of the game.

Too much downtime to be played on board, at least for my taste. I am becoming more and more allergic to downtime. Bookkeeping is also very tedious, so I would rather play this online.  Could be a 9 or 10, if played regularly with same (fast) players, but that seems to be a dream never come true.

At its core this a good game. It is however fundamentally flawed as you have to be militant in order to do well. The game also lasts way too long and is rather creating a rinse and repeat feeling. Further weakness related to this is that all the cards are always in play. There is really no specific need to play this as Nations is also around.

Yep, this game is the real deal. It has so many things that I like: civ game, very Euro, very fiddly, superbly balanced, intricate and complex.

The game is actually not as difficult as I had thought. It is complex, there's so much going on, and everything is interconnected. So rich, so well-designed, and thought out.

Despite being a new and revised edition the game feels dated. The game takes too long, has too much downtime and it is too fiddly. The game is repetitive and the luck of the draw with the events and the military cards are present and can be annoying given the duration of the game. I'll probably never play it again.

New artwork is very nice, layout makes more sense though its a pity they didn't find a way of having just a single board rather than the 4 or 5 they have now. I like the addition of the clear plastic cubes over the previous versions tiny wooden disks. The cubes are so much easier to handle.

Changes are minimal but seem effective in stopping the runaway military issue. One caveat, that thought is based on just a single play so far.

Brilliant design and loads of fun to optimize your economic engine.  Nice balance between military and economic development.

I have several issues with this game. Fist of all, it is long and fiddly. Graphic design is also not the best what you can see. And finally, the learning curve is quite steep and unless you are experienced with the game, you will loose terribly. Also the player who starts losing in military power can leave and go home, trying to play further while ransacked every turn is the worst experience in this game. On the other hand, game is quite balanced, with a lot of challenges and choices and quite internally consistent. I prefer iPad/iPhone version of this game, where you do not have to solve issues with fiddly cubes and billions of cards on game board so the game takes much less time.

Based on one play. I've had the German edition of the original, but I'm still in the process of crafting paste-ups for the cards so I actually played this new version first.
It's really not THE civ game for me, and I really see it as more of a resource management Euro than a "real" civ game. And for an engine building efficiency Euro your play can be a bit at the mercy of the cards, especially if you're going for a more politics/military oriented strategy. Plays at a good pace compared to its weight, and will get a lot more play. I'll probably up the rating after a couple more plays, because it seems to do what it's set out to do really well.

It's such a shame that this game has some serious flaws because certain parts of the game is absolutely exceptional.  Most notably the whole army dynamic is really weird and it doesn't make any sens that you have to draw the right cards to be able to use your own troops.

That being said, there is a tonne of cool mechanics and enjoyable moments in the game and I have had some quite enjoyable games with it. In the end, the game is strangely neiched as the theme is great but the strategy is random at times and the mechanics are very quirky and tedious.

Improves dramatically on the original edition.

Needs more cards for replay value.

extremely fiddly, takes an extremely long time to learn and to play, but provides an unrivaled, epic experience of building a civilization from the ground up.

[Update] After "playing" this probably 6 times total, I finally actually finished a game all the way through Age III. A few lessons were learned:

1) This game takes ~8 hours to play with 4 players, including nearly an hour to explain the rules. This is even with players beginning their turn during the end-of-turn production of the prior player and without anyone suffering AP.

2) This game is extremely punishing. You CAN fall behind with a single misplay and then be brutally punished by your opponents (via aggressions and wars), causing you to fall further behind. In a 4-player game, this is more pronounced as, if you fall to last place on the military track, you are vulnerable to up to THREE attacks in a row, which can be devastating...

3) Military is the ONLY route to victory. I mistook this game for being a boardgame version of Sid Meier's Civilization - with alternative routes to victory through Culture, Science, OR Military (since these are the three 'scoring' tracks in the game). NOT SO! You MUST maintain a competitive military THROUGHOUT the game, or at least be working on an economic engine to become the strongest military. The game DOES NOT reward non-military play in any way that would compensate you for the very heavy losses you will take in Aggressions and Wars.

4) You will not even begin to understand how to play this game until at LEAST one FULL play-through all the way to the final scoring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A decent civilisation game. Still perhaps a bit too efficiency and know the cards focused for me, and less strategically and tactically dynamic than I want in a 2P game.

Also the pile on in a 3P game feels like a weakness of the game. The opportunity cost is low, and there's little dynamism created between the player left out of the combat and the two participating, it's very transactional.

The military and tactics system is clunky and odd.

I want to like Through the Ages more than I do. I want to love it as much as the people on BGG do. But I don't and I can't. There is nothing wrong with the game. In fact, for a CIV it is quite elegant and visually it looks stunning. This is a good, clever and well produced game. Why did I rate it a 7.5?

TTA is the heaviest game I have ever played. It will take you many, many plays to learn the game and familiarize yourself with it. Only then does it become a game to be enjoyed. My wife and I played it twice and both times we didn't even finish the game due to time constraints. This game is long. Only someone who has played this game A LOT can finish agame in 120 mins. This is a four hour game with 2 players and more with three or four.

So this is a heavy game that lasts hours. For this reason my wife doesn't like it and refuses to play it anymore. She feels exhausted after having played it and didn't enjoy the experience. I can't blame her. This is a gamer's game. A niche game for a hardcore crowd. I admire the game, I own the game and I enjoyed playing it. But I can't deny that the game's complexity and length are major marks against it. This game will probably rarely hit the table, which is a shame.

It's long and a bit flabby. It feels scripted and it's all pretty abstract. It punishes players once they get behind the curve and it's horribly fiddly, but when you get to the end of a game there's a real sense of satisfaction that you've tamed a beast and you immediately think about how you might try something different next time.
Feels like a 70's Avalon Hill game, but a bit more refined.

Truly fantastic game that I got as a 21st present, plays super well. Played it once on Tabletop Simulator before playing it in real life and it's safe to say that I'm 100% sure I played most of the game wrong. Therefore, this time round, the game took much longer than it did on TTS: from one hour online to two hours for a 2-player game. Now, this is the absolute maximum I could see a two player game going, and it took even longer with the absurd setup it needed and learning both the mechanics AND the rules at the start, because constantly throughout the game we were checking up rules, taking back moves to be valid, etc. 

However, with this said, it played relatively quickly once we got into the groove of the game, knowing what we could do and probably what we should do. Euros in general just take ages to play: look at Agricola, an absurdly long game with an absurdly long set up time that can take up to an hour for two players but is on the Mount Rushmore of Worker Placement games. You know what else is on it? Puerto Rico, Terra Mystica, and this game. Yes, with all the negatives about getting into this game, you can clearly see why this game is so well received. Every move has a lasting impact on the game, and there are multiple facets of the game to focus on. Building Wonders, urban buildings, farm/mine improvements; adopting new technologies; working current buildings or farms and mines to get improvements... there's a whole lot of choice and not enough resources to do everything.

This game brings a tightness, intensity, competitiveness and strategy that wasn't matched by anything since I first played Agricola. The game that could come close is Food Chain Magnate, but there wasn't that tightness in FCM since you had choices galore, you just were always making the wrong one. In New TTA, you really need to cover as many bases but don't try to be too well rounded or you become a jack of all trades, master of none. Sound familiar? (Just try to be safe and cover all bases in Agricola). I compare it to Agricola because Agricola is a fantastic game, and comparing it to Agricola in a serious tone is an accomplishment of itself. I'm not sure if it's better than Agricola, but I've played it twice and Agricola closer to a hundred times than this game. We'll see in a few more games. But there's no reason why this game won't be an instant classic and continual entrant in my Top 5. It has all the things I love about a game in spades. Well done Chvatil, another masterpiece.

Initial Impressions of Short Game Only: I've never played the Civ video games, but from what I do know about them I can see how this was designed to be Civ the card game. It has a lot less abstraction of non-combat and non-growth aspects of civilization that a lot of other civ-themed games have, such as maintaining "happiness" and needing to feed your people. Through the Ages has a lot of good things going for it, but honestly I think I would rather play Clash of Cultures or Imperial Settlers most of the time.

Compared to Clash of Cultures, they are of similar length, but Clash of Cultures has a map aspect, has a big plus of unique powers (at least with the expansion),  and has tech "fields". Now, you will start differentiating pretty early in Through the Ages, but the problem is outside of your leader you mostly just get bonuses in certain stats, rather than having abilities that feel completely different from others. Such differentiating stat boosts are important, but I want to have turns where I feel like doing something cool, not turns where I feel like I am doing more of the same. I also would guess Through the Ages has more tactical depth since what you do each turn depends a lot of what cards become available for cheap while still having strategic depth depending on what resources you produce the most of making it easier to get certain things, but I just love the strategic tech fields of Clash of Cultures.

Compared to Imperial Settlers I think Through the Ages is a much better designed game. After all, Through the Ages actually has a fairly decent level of interaction with the military level mechanic, whereas Imperial Settlers 80% of the time it feels like I am just playing multiplayer solitaire tableau building, with what feels like a tacked on raze mechanic to add interaction. This threat of my opponent suddenly boosting their military on a turn means I am actually paying attention to what my opponent is doing. The tableau building of Imperial Settlers also is too much and makes it feel like you aren't really playing a civi game. However, again, Imperial Settlers just has effects that feel more special, and it plays much, much quicker so when I do just want that tableau building feel I'd rather play it over Through the Ages.

I think I understand why this game is considered best with 3. In the 2 player game I played, a lot of the cards were burned in the buy row. Now, cards would probably also cycle as quickly with more players despite less cards getting auto-burned each turn, but it would feel like cards are being removed because other people were considering denying you the benefit of those cards, rather than because of just where those cards ended up. However, there is quite a bit of downtime when it is not your turn, so I feel like 4 player games might drag.

Very good game, not that heavy but with a lot of decisions and possibilities. Each game is different. BUT the game is too long - I dont mind long games but this one with 4 players is longer than Twilight Imperium with 6 players. I played this several times and couldn't finish once because after 5+ hours everyone was exhausted with headache. Interactions are minimal, you just need to control military of your opponents so you won't be destroyed. And yes you can be destroyed by opponents and there is no a comeback mechanism - you just need to wait another 3+ hours and you can't catch up. Game not for everyone.

The earlier version of this game made a really bad impression on first play.  Years later, I tried it out again and not so bad.  Further play on BGA showed that it can really shine.  I do prefer this newer version and it plays well on Boardgaming-online.  It must be difficult to balance all the cards, but I feel like it could use maybe one more go at it.

RATING: 7
The good part about this game is the artwork (amazing), the card drafting mechanic which keeps the game fresh, and the way everything is organized. As a history graduate and a social studies teacher, I LOVE the characters and what they do. 

My biggest complaint is the length of the game. I don't usually intend to spend 6 plus hours playing a card drafting game. I might expect that with TI3 or something wih moveable pieces. Since you take turns to do everything instead of one action, there's a lot of downtime between turns. And by a lot I mean wwwaaaayyyyy too much. 

Now for my own personal qualm, and this gave me an anurism during gameplay. Normally in a civ game you build wonders: the pyramids of Giza, the Collossus of Rhodes, Mouth Rushmore, etc. These are usually huge pieces of history that last THROUGH THE AGES (hence the name). So imagine my rage when next to these amazing advancements I find the technological wonder, the BRILLIANT and amazing important discovery of FAST FOOD CHAINS!!!??? The history major in me screamed and a little piece of me died on the inside when I saw that. Yes that's right folks, right next to the Sistine Chapel we have... burger king. 

That aside I love to end on good notes. The game overall is fun if you don't mind waiting for your turn to come up and if you have a dedicated group of friends that have a "day" set aside. You'll love all the historical references... well just about most of them in my case.

In spite of it's long play time, I get lost in the game and time just flies.  There's so much to consider and really not much in the way of rules.  And though it's abstracted in that it's card driven and there's no physical map (like my old favourite [b][thing=71][/thing][/b]), it gives the sense of building something.

There is just too much luck in this for me:
Say you fall back on military through bad luck (no military cards available on your turn, all taken by the other players), then through more bad luck your opponents draw aggression cards and hit you, e.g. killing population. Now you need to recover both on population, happy faces (since the dead pop pushed you over the limit), and military. 

That's not a game I want to play for 4 hours!

The best game in the world... yup, even better than all those galaxy games. Essentially it is a card drafting game. However, you are building a civilization, so resource management is huge.

Heavy economic game that features one of my favorite mechanics (card drafting) and one of my favorite themes (Civilization building).  There are multiple paths to victory, and the winning strategy is determined by what cards come up in what order. 

The military system is probably the weakest aspect of the game, but it is nice to be able to interact with the other players directly, something that is completely missing from most Eurogames.

Excellent game with almost endless replayability. Not too difficult to learn and so many possibilities and nuances to tactics and strategies for the more experienced player. Definitely feels like TS where one only becomes decent at the game after perhaps the 30th-50th playthrough, and even then there is so much more you can learn. Also many improvements to older version...  I like how normal cards can be used for 1 defensive bonus as well as military all round not being as powerful with necessary nerfs to Napoleon as well as common tactics area being introduced.

I rate it a 6 after two 3-player games. I liked it at first, but I find it too slow and too multi-solo. I´m sure it becomes quicker after ten plays, but I´m not willing to invest the time. Also I find the events too punishing, though I haven´t been punished by them myself. And I don´t feel like I´m building a civilization.

Amazingly strategic game that also requires a lot of rethinking while the card row changes and when opponents attack. Although it is mostly cubes and card pushing, the game forces a lot of interaction between players during confrontation attacks and cutting the queue to get a powerful tech card. It is so difficult to balance all the resources and science and wait, also need military to defend yourself. Unlike some resource management game where you can potentially stockpile and figure out what to do later, TTA demands you to monitor your needs and build costly technology or buildings just in time to do what you want. It is so engrossing and tense and just absolutely amazing. It would definitely be a 10/10 if the game just runs a little bit shorter. There is never a dull moment, but it is difficult to set that much time aside if not for online gaming.

I love the original.... This one looks really good but I am not sure the balance changes were for the best. I do not like how much easier the game became to mistakes, and the nerf in the military made the consequences rather small.

For now, I will stick to my old version. and pass on this one

This is, in my humble opinion, perhaps the most overrated game at BBG. Considering the complexity of the rules, I had expected to get really thrilled playing. Instead I find a rather complicated version of a rather standard worker placement and card building game. My personal view, is that if the game rules are complex then one should be rewarded by an exciting game. Given the popularity of this games, I was really disappointed. 

I would not recommend this game to anyone. There are plenty of other games that rewards you more or equal in terms of excitement that is much easier to understand. If you are interested, then you should be aware that there loads of small rules and restrictions to know before you are even able to play your first game, even with the so-called "First game" simplified version. I will not be able to convince my girlfriend to play this game again due to its complexity.

But yes, I may play this game again if someone else is really eager to play it. But I will not suggest it myself.

Outstanding game of managing a civilization from the ground up, rewarding strategic play which really gets you thinking about how you could improve for your next game. Almost all plays logged were couples games, and not necessarily playing the whole game at once - the four different ages allows us to mitigate the long play time by spreading ages across a couple of evenings. Recommended for anyone who enjoys civilization building, tight resource management and executing long-term strategies.

The biggest downside to this game is that, due to the same deck being used in each game, the only variability from game-to-game is the order in which cards come out.

RATING: 10
I have to say, the new version makes this one a perfect 10 in my book!

The improvements made are REAL improvements, the new way Corruption works is just intuitive and makes the gameplay so much smoother, and I mean MUCH... it's a world apart, in the old version it was a PitA the way it worked, leading to full turns being taken back because we only knew the corruption at the end, now it's so much easier to see it, it's immediate.

I also really liked the way the Tactics worked, not that I benefited from that, I was the one playing then and having them copied :p but it's a big improvement, as is the way that Wars and Aggression are now resolved... removing the sacrificing of units in the wars and allowing the discarding of any Military card to use it as a 1 defense point against an Aggression are excellent implementations.

I also liked the re-balancing done to some of the cards and the inclusion of great Artwork on the cards that make the game much more appealing visually!

I don't remember a single thing I didn't like about the new version!

RATING: 10
I'm fairly certain this is the best game I've ever played, and I haven't grown tired of all of the different strategies that can lead to victory. Hard to get to the table due to its length, and the app that was released emulates the board game so perfectly that I don't see myself playing the hard copy much in the future. Still, my favorite heavy game.

RATING: 8
Provides a strategically complex challenge which manages to stay fairly simple in terms of rules. Sure, there's a lot to think about, but the iconography and player boards are well done. This stands out among other complex games because of how the actions make intuitive sense. 

There are so many choices, yet formulating a general plan and strategy isn't too hard. "I'll build up my ore production, build a laboratory to increase my science production, then work on military before my opponent gets too strong." However, turns usually take a while, and with decisions having long-lasting consequences players might find themselves debating between different plans.

The card drafting method works great (removing cards at the end of the "market" and sliding them down). The order in which cards come out give every game many unique and interesting decisions. Sometimes it can seem a bit unfair when you aren't able to get that card you really wanted, but there are so many avenues to victory that skill is the primary factor.

The engine building and building up your civilization in general is very rewarding. There is the potential for a "runaway leader", mainly because of how strategic it is, but even in the last few rounds a lot can change. 

The only real flaw in this game is the length. It's very long, especially on the first play, and on the first play you might feel overwhelmed and end up not understanding how elements interact. Be prepared to spend 4+ hours (My friend and I took 6 hours on our first playthrough) not exactly knowing what you're doing. After you "understand" how the game works, the various elements work together very well.

Also, it can be very punishing. Getting behind a bit in military isn't really a problem, but being moderately behind can be *very* bad. This isn't necessarily a negative, but some might be put off by how brutal the game can be at times. (There is a peaceful variant, but you end out missing out on a lot of the game, and balancing is probably a bit off.) And as with many engine builders, if a player is not able to build a good engine, they will fail and might find themselves without any saving grace.  For example, not building an adequate food engine can leave a player with no reliable way to gain new workers, which can completely stop their progress.

The theme is integrated extremely well. It doesn't get in the way of the gameplay but makes actions feel more meaningful and gives the game more of a narrative. It does feel like true civilization building, even though it's all just cards.

Not for everyone, but those willing to take the plunge will find an extremely deep, brutal, and strategic Euro.

Edit: Lowered rating to 8 because it is a little too brutal and long for me. Getting behind in this game can be pretty terrible (3+ hours of being destroyed) so it's probably best to play with similar skill levels.

RATING: 9.5
I'll start my rating at 7.8 with a feeling that it will move after more plays.  My initial impression is that the game is way too fiddly for my taste: the constant accounting of action cubes and pushing of resources up and down my player board began to feel like quite a chore by the 3rd hour of play!

RATING: 9.5
So far I've only played this through the mobile app. I love this game so far. Everything works together so nicely. All aspects of your civilization must be balanced - you need science, food, resources, military, happy faces, actions, good leaders and wonders, etc... But you simply don't have time to do everything.

The game is tense and requires a lot of strategy. Most of the time you aren't doing well, it is because of something you did(or didn't do) several turns ago. But the game also requires you to adapt to which cards show up in which order. You have to make choices about whether to upgrade your farms now, or wait a few turns and maybe try to get a farm from a later age. You also have to adapt to what the other players are doing.

Overall, an excellent game. It's fun to build up your civilization, and if you play well, finally get an engine going that could win you the game.

Es un JUEGAZO. Si tenemos que decir algo negativo sería que tiene mucho despliegue y que es difícil de entender. Pero después de la primera partida va rodado.
Es un juego muy largo, pero que ni te enteras. Puedes ir a muchas estrategias y sin duda ninguna partida es igual que la anterior.
Los líderes tienen un protagonismo notable, una buena elección te puede hacer las cosas más fáciles. 
Es impresionante que solo moviendo unos cubos aporte la sensación de desarrollo de la civilización. Escala perfectamente en todo el rango de jugadores (2 a 4), si bien es cierto que a 4 tiene más emoción y posibilidades con las cartas de pacto, se puede hacer un poco pesado el entreturno.

Although only played the physical game twice, I've played a lot online.  This game (and its predecessor) is just brilliant.  Loads of depth, with several strategies that can be tried in order to ensure victory.  Be warned though that this is a bit of a brain-burner and has a long play time (which is why online is the better way to play IMHO).

Rövid idő alatt a legtöbbet játszott játékunk lett, ez talán mindent elmond... Amióta megvettem és este játszani támad kedvünk,egyöntetűen erre szavazunk párommal, így elég sok 2 személyes tapasztalatom van vele.
Első 2 játék viszonylag hosszú volt, de most már 2-2,5 óra simán végigjátsszuk. De tartalmas és izgalmas ahhoz a játékmenet, hogy a hossza ne okozzon gondot. A játék elején a civilizációnk fenntartása később a nyerőpontok kimaxolása miatt végig figyelni kell. Konfrontáció nekünk pont elég, a hadászatra rágyúrva eléggé meg lehet tolni ezt az oldalát is a játéknak.
Van egy 3 és egy 4 fős partim is benne, de ez sajnos nem mérvadó, nem gémerekkel játszottam, de azt azért hozzá kell tennem, hogy nekik is nagyon bejött a játék.
Nem játszottam az első kiadásával (bár nagyon szerettem volna), csak a szabálykönyvét olvastam át párszor, ez alapján összehasonlítani nem tudom. Érzésem szerint a kék kockák kezelésének megváltoztatása mindenképpen jót tett a játéknak, itt biztosan kisebb az AP veszélye a játéknak, könnyebbnek tűnik kiszámolni a korrupciót.

The app version is amazingly good. The game is a real feat of design, but my relatively low rating is because after you have familiarized yourself with the deck it becomes less interesting--I am not sure why there aren't variable decks a la Agricola to keep it fresh.

I can't imagine playing this much in RL, though--too long and too much bookkeeping for a game with this level of randomness. The way it incentivizes picking on the weakest player is also offputting (whereas it's usually impossible to tackle the leader head-on if they have enough military might).

This game saved my life during my Peace Corps service. Randomly found this one day in a mall in Manila. Bought it and played non-stop, two to three times a week for months. The biggest rating killer is the downtime between turns and the lack of player interaction. But I throughly enjoy the complex decision trees that come up in building one's tableau.

A great game at 3 players. It is long, so you've got to commit an afternoon or a whole day to it. It really plays a lot like the Civilization videogames, albeit without the maps. We've played it several time and enjoyed it. It will be on my shelf and occasionally on my table for years to come.

I've always been skeptical towards games that claim to be civilization games without boards. When I finally got to try the King of civilization games according to the Boardgamegeek list my prejudices were confirmed. I can see that there is a game where you draw and place cards to build combinations to improve your civilization in various aspects. However, I just can't see a civilization for all the cards and I prefer the similar but simpler Nation to this fiddly affair.

RATING: N/A
I can appreciate the design and scope, though as a game it's simply too long and over-bloated.

Updated rating after playing 15 or so matches using the app:
The way wars and conflicts work often results in all players ganging up on the player with the smallest military. And the more that player is ganged up on, the harder it gets for him to get back into the game.
Considering the length, I believe this is a critical flaw. 

This game is grossly overrated.

Wow, I was surprised by this game. It didn't look good at first because I'm used to seeing a map with explorable terrain in this type of game. Through the Ages doesn't have a map to explore, it's all abstracted into different types of cards that you hold in your hand. But it actually ends up working really well.

This game is made for real Civilization fans. Beware that it takes a lot of time to play, at least 1 hour per player and probably more. So I recommend playing 2-3 players so it doesn't take too long. There are lots of little pieces to keep track of as well. But it's worth it because this game gives an epic feeling of civilization-building that is hard to beat!

I like this one very much, although I understand that it may be not for everyone. 

It's well known that this game has high downtimes between turns, but I don't mind that as long as there is no AP. I usually enjoy watching how others work on their turns.

Another usual complaint is that the game is too complex to be enjoyable. Well, all I can say is that after a couple of games mechanics felt natural to me. Besides, the rulebook has improved a lot in the updated version of the game. 

If you can surpass the above, this one is of the most truthful thematic experiences you can get from an euro-style game in my opinion. The feeling that you get while your civ improves age by age is so good. It really feels that you are accomplishing something great. And the best part is that you will probably get that feeling even if you are not the winning player during the final scoring.

My advice to introduce new players to the game would be to tell them not to worry about winning or about strategy in their first game(s). I'd say that explaining most of the ruling before starting the game should be avoided. Allow new players to learn the rules little by little while they play.

I've played some of the original TtA, and this feels a very natural successor.  More compelling graphics, and cubes instead of barrels, both help maintain player engagement.

This epic sprawling and difficult-to-grok cob game gets an 8 from me — if I’m playing the iOS version, solo.  Zips along in around 30-45min, depending on how AP I’m getting, and I can play a full game on my commuter train.

Through the Ages is a true classic of cube pushing that I came to love for some unknown reason. Well, no. Not quite true. I do know what I love about the game, the only remarkable thing is that I love it despite being such a cube pusher.

Through the Ages - A new story of civilization is a game I didn't know and didn't want to get to know because the old one was good enough for me. But now I have played it.

Let's make it short: The new edition is better.
* The old graphic design had something unique that I really liked a lot. The new one is boring and average, but after about 2 minutes I came to the conclusion that the redesign is an improvement. Hell, yes! How could I be so dismissive?
* It's more forgiving and less frustrating, I'm just saying "corruption."
* Overall, the feel of the game is almost identical, with a few nuances that could be very important to some players. The military was restrained. Wars are not as disastrous as they used to be, aggression does not feel too nasty anymore. But that didn't change the fact that a neglect of the military can be severely punished.

One of my friends found the old version obnoxious, yet bought the new edition. And yesterday also suggested and, above all, did not ask to quit after midnight despite the considerable need to be fit for his job the next day. As I said, I found the feeling hardly different from the old TtA, but others probably take the new edition for a significant improvement.

Absolutely fantastic epic civilization card game. I've played several other civ board games, and nothing emulates managing a civilization like this one. You really feel the progression of each age and each turn provides really tough decisions. I feel like in other civ games you lose track of abilities as you evolve your civ but here that is rarely an issue. Will play this anytime and the artwork is top notch. Love this game.

Great mechanics, it flows well and you actually fell like building a civilization duiring  the first two eras. But after entering the second era it  gets a little repetitive. As others have said, a lot of the time is bookkeeping. Also very long game. Easily 5 hours for two players.

RATING: 7
Massive amount of time to learn and play. Took 15 hrs to get through first 2 player solo game to end of age 3. Constant rules references and many details to remember. Enjoyed it, but don't know anyone who will be willing to play this marathon unless 2 ages limit will get the time down to 2-3 hrs. Update: sat on shelf for 8 months. No one wants to invest the 3-4 hrs to play so it's off to the trade pile. Rating based on extreme length of game.

Update:bought the app. Much easier to learn and play. Rating up to 7. Still not as good as Nations.

I wanted to know what was with this game that brought it to the top 5 games of the Geek. But when I saw the disqusting components of the first edition I decided I didn't want to know anything else. 

Then I saw the new edition by CGE and the great introductory video by gaming rules. I fell in love and ordered it imediattely (46€ is a great price by the way). I always wanted a heavy game for my collection and now I got it and I am happy with it. 

The problem I had with other engine building games,was that I felt the game ended too early, before I even started to enjoy my empire. They are more like a race. The answer is Through the ages! 

Yes it's very long and I know that time is precious, especially when you have a job and a familly, but that's what this is all about. That is the game's advantage, not sth that must be fixed.

Fulfilling.- 

(Wife's Point of View: I never thought of teaching the game to her, but one day she saw the box and found it interesting. Maybe I will take my chances 
...and of course I won't mention anything about 3 hours playtime)

I havent played the original since 2,5 years and I can't say the differences makes any difference. The most unbalancing part of the original game was the military deck. What cards you randomly draw changes a lot what options and chances you have. They have fixed one part with the tactics, but the strength of having the right or any green cards to seed or defence/colonize cards when needed is still a randomised factor that make difference.

Essen copy which was sent to market with no handbook because Czech Games didn't have it ready on time. Happy to report customer service was very good and they are sending me the missing item :)

3 player game only to end of medieval age II took 5 hours. But we loved every second!

Downtime can be pretty bad on this game. After 4 plays - most at 4 to 6 hours we still haven't gotten to Age 3, so game length is a bit of a problem too.

A very interesting game, but I had the same problem with this game as I do with Agricola, Caverna and some other games in that I never felt like I was making progress, and it was just a constant, agonizing process of trying to keep my head above water.
Also a bit abstract, I would really like to have guys on a map, but I suppose that's personal preference.

Based this on the app, its a wonderful and addicting game. This game is ridiculously tight and ferocious; hallmarks for any rewarding and competitive cut throat games. Sadly for my tastes, its too tight and demanding but also too abstract. Sometimes I dont imagine a civilization in front of me but an engine. I can see why this is a classic but I can only play this on certain conditions (especially if played as a board game  which is rather more brutal to play on.)

The game was an okay experience. I love the civilization games and this felt like an entertaining substitute at the start. I have one major critique of this game, however, and it lies in how the mechanism for combat between civilizations works. In the computer games, you can fall behind in military strength (specifically when going for a cultural or scientific victory) and make up for that by turtling, scouting, and positioning. This is not even mentioning concepts such as Defender's Advantage, specifically in reinforcements. In this game there are no such intricacies. Your opponent can set back your civilization significantly by having just one more military strength than you. This happens within the course of one turn. Rinse and repeat and you are potentially out of the game. This is an issue that hurts the experience for me. For a game with so much depth, it's a surprise to see such a facile system in place.

Just some notes... I have just started playing through the ages. I have to say, the game started off with more complexity than what I have experienced in any other game before. However, through the ages provides an unique experience. One is continuously busy during the game. Even though this first game took more than 6 hours and was not even completely finished, I was not bored for one second. There are just so many things to do and discover. Although the game looks quite abstract, the theme was very much alive during the game.

A lot of impressions after 1 play:

+ explaining of the rules didn't take that long (but we both played civ games before, so were familiar with concepts as leaders, ages,...)
+ it's really cutthroat: it feels like you wanna do X things but your stone and/or food and/or science lets you do only X-3 (and if you have enough resources for doing X, you'll probably won't have enough action cubes :s)
+ Our game (with 2 all new) took 3 hours, but it certainly didn't feel like 3 hours
- How often will you play this game? With my cult-of-the-new urge, I'll be happy if I can play this once a year. And preferably you wanna play this with the same player 
- I say player, because this is a 2-player game at max, unless you like SM, then  I can recommend a 4-player game
- Exclude all the players in your playing group who suffer from AP, even if it's only a little bit

There is no doubt this is a well designed game with an epic scope. There is plenty going one and tons of choices to make. Lots of strategy and depth to be had here. Which should make it a game that I just love. 

But after playing my first time, I am not really wanting to rush to play again. For starters, the game felt a bit too long--although I have other games I willingly play for three plus hours, this one started to overstay its welcome a bit for me. Next, during the entire game I couldn't help but feel that I'd be better off playing it digitally. A good portion of the actual game is just updating your resources and rankings, essentially just doing bookkeeping. Many games have some element of that, but Through the Ages has a bit too much of it compared to actual game decisions to be great in my opinion. I have heard an app is supposed to be on its way and I suspect that would be my preferred way to play this. It just seems to be a bit too ambitious of a board game, straining up against what players can reasonably keep track of while still having fun. 

So all around, it's a very good game, but at least for me personally the length and bookkeeping aspects of it make me often want to grab for something else. 

Update: Lowering from a 7 to a 6 on the back of several plays in the app. The app is great, I would rate it very highly. And this game still does have a lot of interesting strategic depth for those who wish to explore it. 

But the app has confirmed my thoughts above: The actual board game is so much bookkeeping and not playing. The playtime on the app is blisteringly fast, and it takes care of all the calculations for you making for a much better experience. It reveals to me how much time playing the game in real life is spent on simply calculating the values and moving the cubes around correctly. It's still a pretty interesting game, but not one that I often want to play in real life.

At first this game was really intimidating, even just the layout of the rulebook (three colums of small text on every single A4 page... ugh). But when I finally got chance to learn it (1v1, me vs me) and after first real match against other human player, I really was in love. 

Extra heavy and meaty game, really makes your head spin. When playing 1v1 game has this kinda sweet abstract feel to it. I think its worth of your time and money... after third age when all is said and done you really feel like Einstein.

RATING: 7
There's a lot I want to share about this game. More than most games I've played. First of all, I am giving it a '7', so it is a good game, but not a great game, in my opinion. Some thoughts:

#1: Downtime is a serious problem for this game, even with just two players. We were both pulling out phones during the other player's turn. With four, I can see downtime being truly unbearable (unless you were playing this game while doing something else at the same time). You can't even really plan your turn in advance as the card river is changing all the time.

#2: This is a two-player game that takes 3-4 hours (and more with 3 or 4 players). There are so many other two player games that I would much rather play in that amount of time than this game. If I have that amount of time. I would want to play something rich with theme and more tension, such as War of the Ring or Twilight Struggle or A Few Acres of Snow.

#3: I want this to be a fun four player game, but I honestly don't see how that is possible with the amount of downtime it would cause. A two-player civilization game isn't a need for me. Is it a need for anyone?! If we're going to build civilizations, there should be multiple players interacting. 1 vs. 1 is not the right setup for a civilization game.

#4: It takes a long time to learn the rules and edge cases for the game you ultimately end up playing. The rulebook is helpful, but it's a 24-page walkthrough of a sample game, and that takes easily 90-120 minutes to go through, and then you still don't have all the edge cases right. I had to read both manuals, and then watch a play through video...twice before I could confidently jump in and run a game, and even then, I was looking up special cases the entire game. And, I am the guy who plays GMT and Avalon Hill games, so complexity doesn't scare me easily. It was frankly exhausting to learn this game for the level of fun payoff after it all.

#5: This should not be ranked as the #2 game on BGG. I am perplexed by this. Not because of my own personal opinion of the game as a '7', but because there is no way that the community actually believes this is the #2 game, especially in light of Pandemic Legacy being #1. Through the Ages checks all of the Euro boxes, but...it's 3-4 hours long, at least, and I honestly do not see a large community of gamers for this on a regular basis. You can respect it for what it is, but I really think this is overrated, even by those who like it more than me.

So, with all my negative feedback above, why give it a '7'? Well, because it is a good game (just not a great game). I am keeping it in my collection, but it's probably my lowest rated '7' in my collection, barely avoiding getting sold.

It will take a very special set of circumstances for me to pull it off the shelf and play it again. Those circumstances will happen again sometime, but I see this getting played 1-2 times a year, at most, and more than likely 1-2 times every couple of years. I would rather play this as an iPad game with a group of friends over a month or two of time than in a single session.

After 5 years of play, literally I "always enjoy playing".
Deep strategy, subtle tactics. Every game is different
Good at 2, 3, 4 players, it is a different game indeed at each number of players. Very seasoned players can have a 3 player game in 2 hr playtime
First 3-5 games will be very long, and seem as "almost solo play" or slow. Not at all, once you can play well. Forget about others ... and lose if any other one does not.

RATING: 5
Maybe one day I will give it a proper comment, but in the two games I tried (both 4p) the downtime & playtime killed it for me. There's just no reason to sit there for 5 hours doing essentially the same thing over and over, because the only thing that changes are the numbers. If you find it exciting to produce 3 resources with a worker instead of 1 in Age 3, then by all means, go for it. (Hopefully you also don't mind sitting out a game that went badly for you, with no chances to come back, because it will happen to someone sometimes.)

There is a good game in there, but it's not a game for five hours with considerable downtime. You can do the same thing in a shorter timespan, with less downtime and more excitement in, say, a game of "Nations". Never tried the older design, but I'm astounded how dated the new version feels. They ain't making games like this anymore, and for a good reason. I know there's a huge crowd of fans of this one, but I'm staying away.

TTA is a good but old game and you realize that during the playthrough. Many other games had copied several mechanics of TTA, maybe that's why I have the impression that I had played it already. 
+ artwork in general is beautiful
+ you really feel developing your civ
+ epic

- Downtime a.a. in the end
- too long
- cubes are not very handy
- too much focus on military
- difficult to catch the leader 
In general I would love to play it again, I guess every 1/2 year a full session would satisfy my desire to play a great civ game like this. On the other hand I really do not understand why TTA is currently #2 on BGG?!

The game play is wonderful.  Nice variance in games and many different strategies to use.  The only drawback is the quality of the game pieces (take that with a grain of salt, I'm very much used to FFG quality), and more noticeable to me is the poorly engineered layout.  The play area doesn't 'fit' well.  All the of boards work very well though, my criticism is a purely aesthetic one.

RATING: 7
I've played this twice - once as four-player and once as three-player.

In short, it's an amazingly well-designed, slick, replayable and thoughtful game BUT suffers horrbily from huge downtime and relentless 'mathiness'.

Here's some detail:

There is a lot of downtime. Using the downtime to calculate your next turn's actions is difficult because it will usually depend on cards whose availability can change with every players' actions. Unless you're a genius who can accurately predict what actions other players will perform, it can be easier to avoid the headache and wait until it's almost your turn before planning your actions in detail.

The downtime is especially frustrating because this game offers relatively little player interaction (it feels a bit solo). Many other games with a solo feel at least have the advantage of meaning you can plan your moves without waiting for other players. Not so here.

Snowballing might be an issue. The strong engine-building aspect means it's possible to fall behind irrecoverably. Certain parts of the game (military, events) also seem to result in greater damage to players who are already behind (although there are occasional, small balances to that).

You have to play in a very 'efficient' style. It's all about trying to make every cube and relevant card count every turn, with no wastage. So be prepared to do a lot of math in your head every turn. Personally, I prefer games with a lot of choices but not where 75% of each choice is math (i.e. not this one!).

Apart from the above concerns, it's mostly an excellently designed game. There are plenty of choices and it feels elegant, despite some fiddly bookkeeping. The way you have to 'design yourself' out of problems is smoothly done and will impress most people who like a strong puzzle aspect to their games. 

There's a mercifully small amount of text to read on cards and it's not difficult to scan the game table to see what's available and to broadly see what other players have got.

There are some clever systems that will appeal to more devious players. Interesting things are possible with hidden cards in your hand. Long-term sneakiness is enshrined in the way that 'event' cards are played face-down, only to activate themselves later in the game ... like 'selective' timebombs waiting to go off.

I remain slightly concerned that the game 'plays itself' to a degree. The player has the task of doing all the working-out, which can be heavy, yet the actual strategies can be fairly obvious - being based on what's available. (They're probably still much more interesting than those of 90% of games out there. This is the sort of high-quality game that makes you yearn for perfection). 

Still, an impressively put together game which will leave you proud if you win.

Also if you like Vlaada's other game Mage Knight then you might like this. It's a very different game but in some ways they both have the same feel, with some similar-ish systems and the same kind of 'zen epic journey' vibe.

I have never tried the original version and I am usually not a fan of civ games, but this game is really fun. It is complex, it is engaging how you develop you civilization and it can be brutal if you fall behind in the arms race. However, it is quite thinky and it takes a lot of time and I would only play it with max 3 players.

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Updated graphics and card design definately make this game look spectacular and colorful. New design choices are also more functional and aid in understanding the game.

(+) The closed economical system provided in 'Through the Ages' is by far the most interesting I have seen in boardgaming: the amount of different resources (food, materials, workers, science, happiness, military strength) and the way they interact and influence your game is nothing less than brilliant. This game is all about micromanaging those aspects and it is designed to create an interesting tension field between all those things you have to bear in mind. Doing things right and getting your stuff in order feels like a real accomplishment and in this the game is very rewarding.

(+) This is a very complete and balanced civilization experience. The game lacks a map and some bells and whistles other civilization games provide, but this game makes up for it by ensuring an engaging, clever and complete experience of growing your society. Very few games let each and every action matter as much as this game does and each step you take in TTA should make your potential grow.

(+) The meat of the game puts focus on building your own economy, but still the game offers plenty of very interesting player interaction. Assessing which cards opponents will likely take from the card row can make all the difference in the world, and you really have to keep an eye on the military effords your oppenents make. It is very unlikely that you can win this game by spending all your efford in building up a mighty military, but it is very easy to lose the game when your military might falters too far behind compared to others. Events, pacts, wars and aggression don't play out over a map, but their weight and significance in this game is very obvious.

(+) Military conflicts and tactics have been improved compared to the old edition. The fact that tactics can be copied after a while elimitates a luck of the draw aspect which could have occured before. The fact that military units no longer get sacreficed during aggressions or wars is actually an improvement and it avoids some potentially painful situations in which players could get utterly ruined by destoying their defensive forces. In this new system battles play out a little more tactical and they sure remain meaningful nevertheless.

(+) The game offers tons of possible strategies to follow, some being more risky than others, but all viable when executed masterfully. The luck factor is low (mainly involving event card draws - but this can be mitigated to certain extent, and also the order in which cards are put to the card row (there obviously is no way to mitigate this)).

(+) The cards are very thematic. The wonders you can build, the technologies you develop, the buildings you erect, the colonies you acquire, the type of government you introduce - they really do tell a story and you can immediately feel their effect on your game.

(+) This game grows immensely. Not only the table will become scattered with cards and markers, but you feel yourself getting more powerful. You start out as an illiterate bumpkin being short on everything but when you play your cards right you soon will grow to become a force to be reckoned with. 

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) The game is prone to some downtime as it can take a while for your opponents to finish their entire turn. This downtime gets worse as the game progresses as players get an increasing number of civil and military actions.

(-) The game can at times feel a little fiddly when pushing around similar small counters representing different things. Sometimes I get the impression that the game engine lends itself more to computer gaming rather than boardgaming due to the ton of things to keep track of. This imposes some bookkeeping in the form of tons of tokens on different sort of tracks. This bookkeeping, together with the downtime mentioned earlier makes the game flow less smoothly than I would like to see. My advise would be to organize efficiently: When player 1 finishes his action phase, player 4 refreshes the card row, player 3 handles the income tracks on the culture and victory board and player 2 starts his turn with taking actions - or something like that. Failing to get organized as a group risks making the game drag.

(-) With a ton of different sorts of cards, this game really is a pain to explain to new players. I guess this is the price you have to pay to play such a complete civilization game...

[u]Conclusion[/u]
I break down the conclusion in 2 parts:
[b]What do I think of this game?[/b]
First off, I have a deep respect for this game. 'Through the Ages' was, as far as I know, the first game to introduce a card row in which older cards get gradually cheaper - a solid mechanic which has since then appeared in many more recent games. The mechanic in which you put event cards face down in a 'future event deck' and draw another event card of the 'current event deck' adds so much to the gameplay and makes the game tell a story of its own, directed by all the players. Such concepts have added so much to boardgaming so I see 'Through the Ages'  as one of the big milestones in our hobby (along with the first 18xx-games, Die Macher, Catan, El Grande and Caylus).
That doesn't necessarily make it an exceptionally good game compared to younger games who have borrowed some of its innovatory concepts - but I think it is safe to say that Through the Ages easily beats mosts of its younger 'offspring'. The immensely rich closed economical system in this game is brilliant, perfectly integrated into the gaming system and grounds player actions into a bigger thematic story. This is a huge accomplishment for what basically is a card game! Stripped away from a big central board with a map, tiles with tons of different buildings, a bunch of tech-tree cards, different sorts of resource tokens, military figures, ... this civilization game offers more depth and storytelling than any other of its kind that bring all those bells and whistles to the table but fail at providing deep integrated gameplay TTA provides and which is required to make a civilization game float. I have seen 'Through the Ages' been described as an 'impressionist painting of history' here on BGG, and I think that is the best way to describe this game: without the classic features of a map with armies and cities on them, you don't literally see your civilization developing and taking over the table. In stead with some (in this new edition beautifully designed) cards and tokens on them, like an impressionist painter putting a drab of paint here to represent a river and a spickle of paint there to represent the sun, TTA captivates its playes by making them feel what they are accomplishing and by telling a deep and rewarding story for those who can see past the counters and tokens on the cards and tracks. The price for getting this deep and rich experience is that this game requires quite some bookkeeping and at times, certainly near the end the gameflow may stall a little. In Dutch we have an expression which translates something like: 'I gladly cover those small imperfections with the cloak of love' because TTA never fails to captivate its players with interesting challenges and rich gameplay.

[b]How does it compare to its predecessor 'Through the Ages, a story of civilization'?[/b]
In short: the new edition is better. This new edition looks spectacular which of course helps to get engulfed in the theme, but the new design choices are also very functional, making it easier to understand and explain the game. The changes made to many cards make more strategies viable compared to the old version and I very much like the updated military system making aggressions and warefare a little more tactical. With small changes in the timing of when players evaluate corruption and discard military cards, efford has been made to let the game flow a little more smoothly, which is helpful.


[u]Play time[/u]
Approx. 60-75 min / player (full game)

[u]Tips[/u]
[i]I have yet to test sooooo many strategies! I can really only scrach the surface here![/i]
(*) I would advise against significant investments in military early (unless many different oppenents start doing so). Investing your precious resources and actions into building your economy early will often be a better path to follow
(*) At the beginning of the game, in normal circumstances, you are mainly short of building rescources (and to lesser extent science). A logical first step is to build yourself an additional mine - but this really depends on the starting cards you choose
(*) Bear in mind that wonders do wonderful things, without the need to place a worker on them - this is a significant advantage! There are also less prone to aggression by opponents compared to regular buildings. However, bear in mind that the price of wonders goes up when you build more of them, so choose wisely!
(*) Unless you make use of special abilities like Robespierre, don't change your government style more often than needed as this will cost you too many science-points or actions (in my experience you better adopt one new government style or even remain a depot and boost your action potential with technologies and deal with the fact that you can only have 2 urban buildings of each type).
(*) When explaining the game, do take some time to go through the culture scoring event cards in deck III, they give strategic guidance to new players
(*) Military might alone will not win you the game, but if you lag behind too far on the military track, this will cost you the game. Don't fall too far behind as the game really can get cruel if that happens.
(*) With each decision, think of what that decision costs you on actions, resources, workers (and thus food, happiness and missed opportunities at other places), science, ... Think about the return on these investments. This is a game in which every little gain can make all the difference in the world. 
(*) When times get rough, often yellow action cards on the card display come to the rescue - they are important: use them!

It seems that the victor is generally known about over an hour before the game ends. It is possible this is the result of differing player experience levels. Some games you can enjoy even if you have no chance of winning, I don't think this is one of them. So unless you have players of similar experience level, it probably will result in a runaway victory. Its a long game with a fairly steep learning curve (at least from the strategy perspective) so you either need to commit to it or walk away from it.

I've always enjoyed Sid Meier´s "Civilization" kind of games. This "TTA" is one of them, and is one of the best  "game of civilizations" I know. This game is lovely, and the Spanish edition is superb (Devir have done a great work). Its new graphical approach and improvements in gameplay in this modern version have carved a game that already was very good. An outstanding game, long, deep but with easy rules once you get used to it, addictive, and very enjoyable. 

Now that I´ve played it for a long time, I must say it´s a very good "CIV" game, but too abstract and too much  "mathy" for my taste to be a proper "CIV" game. I like length and mechanics of this game, but at the end, I´d like to see a map, and my empire growing on a map, that´s for sure. But this is a "heavy-Euro-boardgame", and not a "ameritrash", I guess... Anyway, it´s a very good, and epic game.

Also, there´s an digital app, which is very well done. I play it on iPad and still haven´t managed to beat the difficult A.I. level. With the last patch (1.2.4 when I´m writting this) they´ve improved even more this magnificent app. They´ve added an option so you can see the opponent's turn in detail and at slower speed (I choose the slowest possible option to see step by step what the opponent has done and it's great!). For my level of play, the A.I. is very good and, besides, I have´nt had any single problem of stability.
Without a doubt, it´s the best digital (iOS) version of a board game. It´s just perfect!! Hopefully programmers will not break it with future updates ... If something works, better not touch it.
Excellent work of Czech Games!

So long, too much downtime. No catch up mechanism it's actually got a built in fall back mechanism where the further back you fall the harder and longer it takes to do anything. Actively encourages quitting early by having a rule to forfeit. Very dry and repetitive Euro.

This has got everything I enjoy in a good engine building euro. The first few turns feel like a uphill battle as you get your engine running. Every turn, you have more choices than you know what to do with, which forces you to make some painful ones. You never quite feel like you have enough of anything that you need. The game ends just as soon as you feel like you were making headway. Great game all around, hampered only slightly by the randomness of the available cards.

Very much like the previous version, but with some streamlining that makes things run a touch smoother.

I like some of the tweaks that speed up gameplay and make it less fiddly - like the corruption.,   I am concerned that the tweaks to the cards may have unbalanced the shorter 2 era game, which we play quite regularly, as the cards that are strong in that anyway have been strengthened to make them more playable in the full game, but I haven't played it to see yet.  All in all an improvement on the original, but not enough so that I'm going to rush out and replace my copy.

One of my favorit games of all time. I love how involved you get in this game and how every tiny decision is affecting how the game will play out in the end. Love the card drafting mechanism and the combination between strategy and a small amount of luck. It really fells like you are building a civilization and optimizing every aspect of it. The only downsides are that it takes a long time to play (which I think is fine, but i can understand why that puts some people off) and the down time you have when the other players takes their turn.

The new edition is a more balanced improvement of the original game.

While I recognized first edition as a masterpiece of a game, I was quite reluctuant to play it, as I got utterly destroyed every time by more experienced friends. While not the problem in itself - I don't mind losing - the game was rather long and it was relatively easy to get into a situation where not only you have no chance of finishing with same order of magnitude points as others, but actually can't do anything useful for yourself as your civilisation falls apart.

I am not sure how much of it is luck, how much rule changes, and how much just accumulating experience, but while I'm still losing here, I feel that what I do actually matters and that I actually accomplished something in the game. I certainly welcomed streamlining and shorter play time (without really affecting the number of actions in the game), but the most important change was the reduction in power of many cards. In general, all combos which resulted in geometric increase of power/production are now reduced to simply arithmetic increase; for example instead of doubling happy faces, each happiness source simply gives another one.

Hands down an improvement on the original. Cards look nicer, tweaks to gameplay improve the experience. Note however that the tweaks don't significantly change the experience, in particular the fact that this game can be long, and brutal in multi-player - they are simply improvements on the design. The original is still a phenomenal game, and indeed I own that edition, and am in no hurry to acquire this.

Finally played a FULL GAME, and it was amazing. Five hours flew by, and I was engaged the entire time. The only reason it's not a 10 is that, even though I'm engaged, five hours is a long dang time.

Having rated it's predecessor as a 10, this new version leaves me nowhere else to go! TtA is by far my favourite game ever. I love the new version - the tweaks to the brilliant original work well and the artwork is a thing of beauty. I've always been amazed that this very highly rated game has not been revisited by the publisher in almost 10 years, in terms of expansions or new editions. I hope this new edition will prompt further development - extra leaders and wonders will be great - and it would be awesome to extend the game into a further age. But for now - and for the foreseeable future - I'm so happy with this awesome game!

Played a bunch on the mobile app. Basically a card game with player mats for visual aids, but the true mark lies in how it conveys a story of rise and glory. Originator of many nifty things like the seeding of the event deck, the wonderful triple-nature of a yellow marker depending on where on the mat it is (land, worker, production), and the creative means of upkeep (consumption, happy faces, corruption).

The closet a game has come to perfection for me.  Still not there yet, but this version does fix the biggest issue with the prior version (losing due to not drawing a decent tactics card).  Weakening Napoleon also is a nice improvement as well as using any defense card for +1 defense, which makes it impossible to succeed on attacks unless the attacker is at least +3 strength early in the game.

Finally got around to playing new version after a year or 2 break from TTA.  Playing in 3 games on BGO.  Still great, still gives the same general feeling and I think all the elements that really pushed it to the top of my favorite games are still there.

Def like the aggression change for the early game in the discarding for defense.  Should make it easier to hang on if you are a little behind in military at the start.  Need more time, but I think the war change will be better more often than not.  It does seem a little easier to declare small wars now so they may even be a little better on average as you don't have to fear a huge sacrifice.

Card balances all seem really fun.  Rich lands I didn't even notice the change till deep in my 2nd game.  New reserves are great for flexibility.  Now they can all be tempting depending on your needs.  

Still need to test out changes to leaders, but so far seems like they are all great changes.  

Should pick it up and trade in old TTA if I can get some people to play a game a couple times a year at least.  

Looking forward to the expansion for new leaders as well.   Always liked playing the Global variants on BGO with variable setup of leaders/wonders.

I had never played the original version of TTA, but after playing this version I'm not sure I'd want to.  I've read about some of the differences (military and corruption) and I REALLY enjoyed this version.  I am a fan of civ building games, and this game felt like the king of that genre.

Brilliant revision to an already fantastic game! I'm not sure I agree that the sacrificing needed to be taken away. However, there are so many awesome improvements here:
- streamlining the end-of-turn sequence by rearranging corruption
- tactics becoming public, to limit significance of getting lucky in the tactic draw
- better action cards, more balanced leader powers

Great stuff!

Since I've into board games some version of this game has always been in the top-2 games on BGG.  I like civilization games too but just never got around to trying this one.  Well, no more and I love this game.

This is a card driven civilization game that is very, very similar to another game I have and love called Nations.  Each round you spend a certain number of general or military actions.  With these actions you can draft cards, which represent everything in the game from leaders and wonders to technologies and one time actions.  The further from the start of the row they are the more actions it takes to draft the card.  The rest of your actions involve playing these cards which typically also requires a certain amount of resources.  The one niggling thing here is you can't do things like just stock up on resources or workers.  Workers need to be happy and if you have too many they won't earn you resources.  And if you have too many resources there is corruption and some amount of them will disappear between rounds.  The way you mitigate this is pretty interesting as well, goods are represented by blue cubes on a card, the better the card (for example a farm that produces 3 food instead of your starting 1 food farm) the more each cube on that card represents keepign more in your stock.

The military piece also turns out to be pretty well integrated and important.  At the start of each round you have the option to play one political action.  These actions are either adding a card to the political deck and drawing one to play that round, an aggression toward an opponent, or an outright war.  Usually these involve rewarding the strongest player or just the stronger player on one side of an aggression or war hurting or taking something from the loser.  So you can't play this game like I always try to play civ games by ignoring conflict and just becoming a technologically advanced race of nerds.

This isn't going to win any looks awards with little blue and yellow abstract pieces representing your goods and workers.  The "new" story of civilization adds art to the cards that the old one didn't have but the art isn't super impressive but still better than blank cards.    But there is such a deep well designed game here that that's what is going to win you over, not looks.

As I said it is very similar to Nations and while I think this is the "better" game in terms of design, balance, and mechanics.  I think Nations is still very good and has a lot more variability.  I've played this game about 5-6 times now and I've seen every card in the game.  I'm already working out which cards are the strongest and which are the weakest and which strategies are better than others.  I think this game is very "solvable" or at least strategies can be easily optimized after enough plays.  I don't think that will happen in Nations.

Very interesting to hear of the changes.

As a TTA veteran my first (and quite probably misplaced) thoughts were that it is a nerfed TTA - tactics and sacrifice changes. I really like the fear of military in TTA, its the main reason why players keep their eyes on other players tableaus.

The other fears are that the balancing of cards is going to create a more bland experience. The joy of TTA is partly the spiky card powers. Please don't be anything like that abomination for milksops ('Nations').

Whatever happens I'm buying it and will be playing it to death.

Now having seen some of the cards it does up power some of perceived weaker cards ('Joan of Arc').

Not keen on new production style a bit beige and pastel and indistinct. 

First play. Smooth. Very close to original. Liked the toning down of Napoleon. 2nd play and admire the small changes but I don't enjoy it as much as 1st edition - partly because my formative TTA expereince was with 1st edition and I prefer the spikier parts of 1st.

I felt more like I was learning how to count cards than playing a board game.  It is a great idea, and I see why so many strategy lovers rate this game highly.

Cooler pieces/artwork and more streamlined than the first version. However, it is still way too long of a game for me. Sure you have a decent game in there somewhere, but after 3 hours, you realize there's still 5 hours to go of complex micromanagement of every little bit of your resources. This felt more like work than something you'd play for fun. Overrated/10.

RATING: 8.75
If there was a way to make it shorter, yet still as rich, with a little more player interaction, it'd be a 10.  Because it is so long, it doesn't hit the table that often.  Players with AP will probably need a timer to prevent excessive down time for other players.

Another downside is that at times it can be a bit of a numbers-crunching multi-player solitaire affair as each side seeks to optimize their engine (e.g., the production of food and resources).  There is some player interaction though: card draft blocking, occasional military attack, plus you'll need to keep a constant eye on your opponent's progress on military strength and technology (i.e., keep up, else prepared to get suddenly slaughtered in war).

Note that if you are a much more of a "mathy" or efficiency-mind person than your opponent, you will likely build a much better engine, and this will give you a BIG advantage later in the game.  To counter this, you may need to award your opponent with some sort of handicap at game start, such as an extra civil and/or military action per turn that lasts the entire game.

Overall, lots of fun, as you take a trip through time and build your empire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Truly improving the original, though the lengthy gameplay and the non-trivial learning curve stays.

Which is about the only negative to this game.  The new version improves on points the original, but especially so the warfare. It still hurts to lag behind, but you won't get totally crushed as defending (especially early on) has been made easier. 

Various cards have gotten tweaks so that now I haven't yet found a card which isn't useful in some situations. It now is even more about 'choosing your path': will you focus on culture, technology, warfare or resource gathering? Will you push the event deck as you anticipate it being stacked towards your strong points or will you try to avoid firing off events as much as possible and focus on your engine instead?

As far as I can see, leaders have gotten the most tweaks, and all have their uses. Awesome. As for eye-candy, the game now looks much better compared to the original.

All in all, I even worry it might be difficult to sell/trade my old copy. Which is a strange experience for a game in the BGG top 20 that deserves to be on any gamers' shelf if you like civilization building games and/or medium-heavy strategy games.

Length and weight is the only thing holding this off from getting playtime but if you think that would be no problem for your playing group, get this (or the original, which is still an excellent game by itself). You won't regret it.

This is a great game, but it has one serious flaw in its game mechanics.
You can plan your turn on the other players turn, but since events and attacks can have such a big impact on your plans you have to plan your whole turn once more on your turn.
This is a design issue that makes the game drag out to much,especially events on your turn right before you do your action phase.

I know it´s just my personal taste, but I don´t see enough of a story evolving in this game. I don´t feel like a leader of a nation while playing this, but like an accountant: Pay two of your As to get a B. Pay a B and three Cs to finally buy a building. Guess what - that building will give you later on in the game two As.
That´s it. Now - let´s seee, who can change his As, Bs and Cs at the best rates...to gain modifiers (again As, Bs, Cs)The theme is just poorly pasted on the game-engine and would also work good with every other topic.
If you´d ask me, the game should be named "A Bookkeepers Story of Civilisation" - but as I said, these are just my 20 Cents to a game, the community loves... AND:  the tutorial of the App is brilliantly funny!!!

Great game that rewards careful planning. Not overly cutthroat as taking cards you don't need punishes you rather than your opponent, but a tactical war can screw you over. Mechanics work well together, meaning that neglecting even one part of your civilisation can mess you up.

Best played in a three as there is a little downtime between turns and with four it can get a little laborious. Always happy to get it on the table.

Intensely deep, rich, and dynamic. The underlying systems are ingenious,  It is highly thematic. The strategies are intricate, and yet there is a degree of tactical necessity to keep you on your toes from game to game. There is a level of variance that I'm sure will bother some who prefer their games with no luck, but I find managing that uncertainty invigorating. 

It is a game that begs its players to achieve mastery, and yet mastery always feels just out of reach.

There is Through the Ages, and then there is everything else. It is the game against which I measure every other game I've ever played.

9 -> 10

This version is a little bit different, than the old edition, but after almost 2 plays (one was incomplete - to the middle of Age III) I think the old edition is a little bit better. Although the new one is still a great game.

Advantage of the new version
- The new cards: In the previous edition, there where some cards, that where realy bad, like Khan. Did someone ever choose this leader? This bad cards became new rules and are now better. So know every cards is really strong. Harder to choose cards.

The new cards are also more interesting, because they give you more different things (like only 4 points, but also 1 science instead of 6 points but no science in the old version) or give you a choice (like every turn do this or that).

-artwork: Tthe artwork is beautifull, but very important, during the game everything is clear like in the old version

-replacing a leader: now you do it as a free action, so you will more often replace your leader


Disadvantage of the new version
-Military is not so strong: I know the TtA is an economic game, but this military aspect was something interesting, something that you don`t have in other econimic games; in this version you still have military, but is not so powerfull. So tou could do more things to get points. In other word the new version seems to be more poor (only economic way, in the old version you could also the military way)

-Corruption is now easier to see (this is a clear advantage), but is easier to avoid corruption. Specially with the colonie, that now give you so many blue and yellow cubes. So you don`t feel so much presure like in the old version. The game is more easy. Fortunately still hard, but obvoisly more easy

EDIT: The game is easier when many colonies come into play. But if you want`t play many colonies there will be not so many in play.

Military strange is not so powerfull like in the old version, but a war can still be a danger for another player.

In others words after 2 more playes I see, that the disadvantages are not so huge. The new version is overall a little bit better, than the old version

The more I play this game the more I like it. It seems to be at it's best with three players, but we normally have four at our game nights, there is a little more down time and it is a bit harder to make any sorts of plans to your next turn with the extra player, but it is still very enjoyable. A few of the cards seem overpowered such as the technology trade pact, but it hasn't hindered our games yet. The war over culture is interesting in that it makes you have some sort of military, just in case someone blows you up. So far my group has gotten quite a few hours of entertainment here with countless more to come I am sure.

I think this has actually become my favorite game.  It is absolutely marvelous.  Every turn garners meaningful decision points, and when the game ends, a clear arc exists for what your civilization became.  So very very good.

I was expecting great things from this game, considering its rating. After getting it and reading the rules, I was almost sure I would dislike it. And after playing it, I can say it is something in between for me: positive but at the same time not as good as an 8.7 would suggest.

An incredibly deep civilization game using only cards and cubes. Features war, resources, auctions, science, and drafting in small ways. Turns are long but are engaging for the player in particular. Deep long game.

RATING: 7.5
The game is very well designed and the mechanisms all interact very very nicely.

Overall the rule set is quite minimal and the depth to complexity ratio is quite good, you get a lot of game to chew on without needing to focus a lot on looking up rules.

The only downside is the length of the game, it is quite long.  Even if you played at a rabid pace I can't see a 2 player game getting finished in much under 2.5 hours and with 3-4 player you are probably pushing 4-4+ hours for the full game.  

You can speed up the game with an assembly line like structure for the maintenance round but that can also make the experienced feel rushed.  Due to this and due to the fact that this game definitely results in players "rolling back" their half completed turns frequently it is probably best played on an App...and that makes me sad to admit.

The new version gets a slight bump over the old, the components are nicer, the play is slightly streamlined, the Military aspect is tamed slightly and the cards have 10+ years of balance, however the box footprint is at least doubled...which may irk some.

In short very good game, but can be quite long and fiddly.  I'd probably never shoot down a 3 player game of this but it might also be hard to find the other 2 players considering the time commitment.

[thing=182028][/thing] is a civilization game that is basically made of cards and some tokens. The games takes you from Age A, I, II and III, making your civilization pass through leaders, new political orders, technologies and developments regarding: farms, mines, arena, labs, libraries, temples, theaters and infantry - this are general names, don't take them to the letter (like, journalism is a library development, airforces are also infantry, and such). The winner is the player with the most culture by the end of the game, but during the game you will have to manage other things as well: food, resources, army, hapiness, population and ideas (is with ideas that you "discover" new techs, new political orders, new military units, and so on). Everything is important, and you can use them in different ways to achieve the same goal (more culture).

A player turn has two main phases: political phase and action phase. In the political phase you can start wars, agressions and treaties towards the others civilizations, and also you can play events, that will trigger latter, and thus you can prepare for it. In the action phase you use the avaiable actions to increase population, discover techs, put people to work, build wonders, put a leader in play, and other things.

However, the game doesn't [i]fell[/i] as a civilization game to me - I could basically be building one factory, improving machinery, hiring CEOs, disputing for selling deals, making advertisement and market wars and agressions, etc, and things would feel the same to me. Maybe I'm too visual person, but the lack of a board, miniatures, or tokens representing the armies, the new colonies, take away the sense of place, distance, size and quantity. I can't see and army closing in. I don't attack a given place, I just... attack the whole civilization, not a region, nor an important city. [thing=182028][/thing] is way more abstract than I like my civilization games.

As I'm not a very experienced player of the old TTA (9 plays total), the differences between the editions, while noticiable, weren't enough for me to even feel playing a new edition. It was mostly the same for the bigger part of it.

The main difference I did notice was: the military. As more often than not, in the old TTA, the game will be basically an arms race, in which the players try to build the biggest military might in order to beat someone else. And, as it worked, many times the one to be crushed won't be the leader. Will be the one with the weakest army, and this can (or can't) be the leader, but it won't matter all that much. Then, things can go to the "bullying" side, because, if someone attacks you, and you defend (using cards and sacrificing units), you open your civilization for an attack of the next player, and again, for the next (considering a 4 players games, in wich the next player after you attacks you), with you getting weaker everytime (and, thus, making even better to attack you). I really do not like this aspect of the old TTA.

Now the New TTA doesn't allow for sacrificing units. Also, every military card can be used (the the limit of military actions) to add a +1 in defense. This works really well to prevent some early agressions and, if no one could open a big lead in military, even wars in mid-game. Agressions will still happen ocasionally (as they only cost military actions, but have no other downside for the attacker), even if only to make someone discard cards. Also, the Tatics cards being public after one round is also a neat change: more then one time in the old TTA I would search for a fitting Tatic to no avail - now I can copy one someone else used. Simple and very helpful.

There was also several changes in leaders, yellow cards (adding options), and so on - but these were too minor for me to properly make statements about them.

The downtime (even with 3p) is still severe.

In the end, [thing=182028][/thing] is still not a game that fits right with me. Though it is pretty solid, I'm more of a visual person, and the lack of map, units, distance, areas and so on, make TTA too abstract to my tastes. The new TTA sure is, to me, an improvement over the older one, and I recommend it for those that liked [thing=25613][/thing], but were turn off by the military aspects of it. While one can't simply leave the milirary to the wind and go all peace and love, you will be able to do a little more of that here.

I started out loving this. The first few times the tension of the game into the second age was addictive. I always felt like I could have made better decisions and I wanted to do more (can't do everything in this game and the tension is delicious).

Then subsequent plays reveal that the game is essentially a combo assembly puzzle and they who make voltron, win. End of the game always feels abrupt and vaguely unenjoyable. Wars are very difficult to profit from making the military side of the game feel poorly implemented. It can wreck you if you ignore it but there's not a lot of feel good in it should you pursue it (military side of the game).

Needs another iteration to get this right.

No doubt better than old version: faster, more fluent, military more balanced. Over sized box is the only drawback if compare to previous version. I give 9 but I'm not happy with the ending of this game. Most cards become useless in the last Age, intriguing atmosphere of previous ages is lost, you have the only task to finish some super-wonder or etc. Ending turns to boring mathematical AP.

The undisputed king of civ games. Through the Ages proves that you don’t need a map to feel like you are building your own unique civilization. Through a very smartly designed resource system where you are constantly managing two separate tracks, often at the expense of the other and genius card play, your civilization grows and flourishes as time marches on. This is a demanding game that requires your full attention because a false move early on can spell disaster as costs increase and actions get more complicated. Overall, this game is a masterpiece and represents Vlaada at his absolute best.

Never played the previous edition, but this is definitely the best Civ game I have played so far. The rules are surprisingly easy to grasp, while decisions are hard to make - just the way I like my games. Constantly tuning your engine just to keep progressing is challenging and fun. There really is no single area in which you want to lag behind. The only reason why I do not score this game any higher (yet), is because downtime is pretty bad with four players and game length is longer than I would prefer. I did feel like even the "short game" outstayed its welcome in the end. Curious to find out if game length improves on our second play.
UPDATE: Played again (with four), and it was only a little faster than before. Really enjoy playing it, but the game is just too long to be wanting to play it again soon.

RATING: 8
Is one of those that rarely sees the table due to the play time necessary, and can suffer from being one of those games that you go and do your taxes between turns.  It's better than many other civ building games I've seen, but in future plays I'm looking to house rule a couple of things. Specifically the public building limit seems one too low at every phase of the game, such that there are a bunch of turns during which you can't draft a card because you don't have the space for it in your hand because you need two more turns for enough science to get something out of your hand that will make the next thing out of your hand cheap enough to play at all, and you just end your turn with 4 or 5 actions available two or three turns in a row because there's nothing else to do with them.

Upfront, I've only played this on the app, never the physical copy so far.  I do imagine that playing it in person, I'd probably get annoyed by the massive play time, I might get bored in between turns, and I might find shoving cubes around a bit tedious...  That said, I've been playing the App nonstop since getting it.  Over a dozen games a week.  I can't get enough of it.  So  many intriguing interactions and combinations and strategies to work through.

I do have to say, the game is pretty brutal.  It took over a dozen plays before I ran into a situation where I didn't have a good pull available to me, I fell behind in military and got completely pounded on by every other player effectively making me lose whole turns and fall further behind.  There isn't a catchup mechanism, people might offer you pacts, but they'll also be benefiting them.  This is pretty rough for a game that lasts 4+ hours to have to sit there and be a punching bag for that long.

I'm usually in the mood to play this, but it does have some issues. The length and lack of threaded turns gives way to too much down time. Many people either complain of the strength of military or whine that the game isn't interactive enough. I think Civ games are probably the only games that can bring different types of players together. This isn't quite dynamic enough to justify it's length, but the matrix of decisions gives me enough to be engaged. The game is about 70% of the way to being great. As it stands, its a re-dressed worker placement game. That's not great, but considering how overdone that can be, this isn't bad.

A good game that just tries to be too much. My comments about the older version apply here almost exactly. The only changes are that the worst parts about wars has been solved since and the components are a lot nicer. Other than that this still is too much mechanics for a boardgame and this is better played on the computer or tablet. Nations(with expansion) has just further solidified it's status as the go-to card civ game because you actually play a game and get some immersion. Even if TtA has the clear advantage on paper and is clearly superior it just doesn't translate into the actual gaming experience. TtA just feels like a battle to remember all the tiny rules and cube movements and whatnot rather than a game of civilization development.

I enjoy this game plenty, just like its predecessor [gameid=25613].  The basic mechanics of building your civilization without a map, and abstracting out the military to a track is a wonderful design choice.  The balance and decision-making is very well-done, and this is going to feel like what you want out of a Civ game, with a constant desire to get to your next turn, and lay down your new technology, and use your resources to grow your Civ.  It's still one of the best of the genre.

The changes made from the previous edition are all positive, from what I can tell so far.  Cards that were never used by strong players have gotten buffed, and cards that were almost always taken at 3 actions were nerfed.  Military has a more consistent application throughout the game, so that new players aren't quite as surprised when it comes into play in the last age.

The biggest problem I have with the old game is still present here, though, which is that the late game almost always devolves into a gigantic military standoff.  Wars over Culture, which steal points from one weaker player and give them to a stronger player, are even more powerful now.  This runs counter to the general rebalancing away from military that we were supposed to see in this new version.   Though I haven't played this version extensively, all signs point to it being just as present in the late game here, perhaps even moreso.  Experienced players can compensate for this, but this is brutal for newbies, and is the reason that I often reach for a different civ game instead.

Brilliant game, will play whenever I can set aside the time. Normally don't like games that are long, but this one is a winner and the length is appropriate for the theme and type of game.

Every play is different with different combos of cards popping up at different times. Balancing the management of your economy, science and military is challenging and engaging without being too complex to keep track of.

The theme is pretty strong and most mechanisms are thematically grounded in a clear way.

Not for every gaming group so make sure that you have people prepared to dedicate 6+hours to a game before you buy it. If you have enough players, this is a must have game.

It's still a very good game, but I don't think the new edition does quite what I'd hoped it would. Yellow cards, which were already close to too good, got better. Iron and Coal is still too expensive a path, except in peaceful games (which shouldn't exist). Several Age 3 techs are just bizarro expensive and will almost never be built (Oil esp.). 

And the new military means that parity through Age 1 and 2 should produce exactly no conflict, while Age 3 will produce predictable wars if enough disparity is allowed. I don't miss kingmaking, but the new method loses a lot of tension. Not allowing sacrifices also reduces the importance of a strong food (and to a lesser extent, rock) engine; you can't leverage a "wipe out and build back up in one turn" process, again robbing the game of tension and options.

It's just a safer, easier, smoother experience, and it's both better and worse for this.

(rating this based on the old version, and reading a list of  changes. the game seems definetly better, but my main issues with it are not fixed. although that would make it another game, so it's understandable)

There's a lot of things I really like about the game, but the point-at-one-person nature of wars and agression is something I can't stand. I think that is simply a design flaw. This is the main reason for my rating.

(btw this is based on one play, where I was the agressor, and won the game, but I almost didn't want to do it, but I said, okay let's play the game how it was designed. it seems it was designed for this, because I won)

There is also considerable luck with the cards, some of which is fixed by the new edition.
The game is also very long, which is understandable from a mechanisms viewpoint, but I'd just rather play two or three or ten other games. Also this length means that other than taking some interesting cards, you never really feel you did something big, but then again, just taking a card is not too interesting. I actually like the fiddly administration part of the game, but it never felt like it really mattered other than to not make mistakes there.

I guess I should try the simple game without agression.

edit: I did try the simple game. It's clearly not what the game was designed for, it's only maybe good for learning the rules. Didn't help my opinion.

First of all - this is a brilliant design, I love it. The new edition looks absolutely gorgeous. I'm really fascinated by how all these different layers of strategy come together and form a deep and rewarding game. It's just wonderful.

But in order to fully enjoy this game you have to play with the right people and with the proper attitude. Because although Through The Ages is amazing, it's also not without its flaws:

1. This game is really long when played with inexperienced players. When I play 1v1 with a pro, we finish the whole game in less than 2 hours (I didn't believe it could be done, but it's really possible once you know all the cards). Unfortunately, a 3p game with novices can last up to 6 hours (I'm speaking from experience here). It also generates an extreme amount of downtime which gets longer and longer as the game progresses. I can't imagine playing it with 4 players, you would have to wait 10 minutes before your turn arrived. Either play with pros who know the game well enough to make fast turns or stick only to 2P games.

2. If you are behind on the military track in a multiplayer game you'll be eaten alive by your opponents. Stronger players are either "preying upon the weak" or participating in an neverending arms race so that they can't be targetted by a war on culture card. You may be building an efficient culture engine throughout the game, but if you neglected your military forces all this culture will be "stolen" by stronger rivals. I understand that the whole point of the game is not to fall behind on any track, but I feel that military is too much of a focus and successful wars/aggressions can lead to a devastating snowball effect (not a good thing in a 6-hour game). In theory you might be playing with the peaceful variant, but I feel that the game loses that "special something" when you do that.

Just be aware of what you are getting yourself into and you'll have a great time with this game. It's amazing, but very unforgiving.

It's ok, but:
-too long, player's simply gets bored and no longer follow moves, other players do
-you feel most of the time, like you could done something better, that you have done something wrong and you have to fix it now. You don't have that feeling, that you did a great civilization and led it through the ages

A while back a few, I played a game of the original Through the Ages online with my co-workers. It was a memorable experience to say the least, with a back and forth swing of power as we would all ebb and flow with power through the ages. I wanted the game, but avoided it due to its length and age.

When I saw that Czech Games was printing a new edition with greatly improved art and some rules tweaks, I was interested. However, I saw that Eagle Games would be publishing and I wanted to figure out a way to avoid them if possible. At the time of my purchase, the only way to get Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization was through Eagle Games and it was running $70. Weirdly, it was cheaper to buy the Czech Games version from France than it was to buy it from Eagle Games. Crisis averted!

When the game arrived I knew I wanted to play it soon and I knew I’d have to employ some aggressive tactics to get my wife to try it out, but I also had a strong suspicion that she’d love the game. So, one night I setup the game and started briefly explaining the game, just bits and pieces and the overall flow of things and I told her that I wanted to play it tomorrow and that since it’s long we can just break it up over two nights.

We sat down to play it the next night and you could hear how overwhelmed she was as she took in the rules and mechanics. Different kinds of cards; cubes that are, but aren’t workers; consumption, corruption, production, happiness, culture, science, and so on. Yet, about mid-way through Age I, I heard a night-and-day change in her voice, the sign that she understood what she was doing and had internalized the rules! Awesome news! With that, we were off to the races and the game picked up speed and we finished a bit past our normal bedtime, but not too late. She liked it, she liked it a lot, and that made me a happy teacher.

This game is a classic, one of those games people talk about fondly through out the hobby and I can see why. I love how the game moves and how you feel a sense of growth and grandness of scope. I suspect this game will be an easy sell to my game group, but either way, it’s sticking around.

Through the Ages is heavy, abstract and long (about three hours) but the time-taken to journey from the dawn of civilisation through to the modern age feels very epic and is very rewarding.  It manages to capture the feel of the civilisation computer game without trying to replicate it.  The game does not provide any sense of geographic location (no map board) but everything else that might be expected of a civilisation-type game is present.

This is a great game but it is no substitute for the real thing (Civ computer game). The digital version (not the app but the actual Sid Meiers computer game)is a much deeper and much more enriching experience. That said though, for a board game this does a fantastic job and I enjoy playing.
My favourite mechanic in board games is some kind of engine building and this game has it in spades.

This game is so excellent. The mechanics are awesome - action point and a kind of card drafting, plus resource management. There are tons of strategies, and the game play is super tight. Yes, it's long, but it won't feel long when you're playing.

One of my favorite games (maybe my favorite?) - I play it on the app every day or so. Not sure I can give it a 10 because it's so much better as an app that cleans up the book keeping, and it's fairly hard to teach with a steep learning curve that I'd love to call "easy to learn, hard to master" - but I'm not sure that's true.

Long, deep, very strategic game. Rules-wise, it's pretty straight-forward, especially for a game of its depth. Wars and aggressions make sure player interaction is much higher than just card denial.

Awesome game! Can get quite thinky and its not an easy game to get people into. Theme attracts me as a Sid Meijer Civilization PC-game enthusiast, and it works great. I like how this game presents tough choices and strategical variety. Full game is a bit long though, so taking a break between ages (or for the transition into the final age) might be a good idea.

Took a few games to click, but this game is FANTASTIC.  The peaceful variant (no wars or aggression cards) will be played at my house since my wife isn't big on direct conflict, but I'm ok with that.  Each game is about adapting to the order in which the cards appear in that particular game. What works one game won't work another game, and that's excellent. Now that the app is out, I don't know that I have a reason to hold on to the physical game -- it's still great, but the app takes care of the upkeep much faster than an actual person can.

RATING: 10
Made great game even better with beautiful artwork and fine tuning to military and some cards.
It is still not a 10 because it's a "perfect game" mechanically - old flaws (from modern-day gamer's perspective) remain: longevity, downtime, upkeep (although streamlined)... - it is a 10 because it is a 10-worth experience every time through. Biggest + for me is even stronger now - abstracting history while keeping phenomenal historical feel.

I only want to play this more and more... it may well be, with Twilight Struggle, the greatest game ever designed. You can always add some negative - for example I didn't mention that it's in a sense always the same game cause you always see all the cards (unlike let's say Nations). 

But all analysis aside, this game has something special, and for me it's not just that it resembles Sid Meier's CIV, which I liked and played up till fourth installment, think it's a watershed in gaming, yet do not adore it. 
TTA has something undefinable - unlike even TS or HIS/Fief which I can brake down to basic factors of greatness. 

On the other hand - APP implementation is so good that it once again showed all the problems of the board game - upkeep and downtime at first place.

Este juego se ha convertido en mi favorito junto a Clash of Cultures. Through the Ages recoge en un juego de mesa toda la esencia del juego Civilization de PC. La sensación de ir progresando poco a poco con tu civilización desde la antigüedad hasta el presente (igual que en el juego de PC) es lo que buscaba. Además su reglamento es toda una obra de arte que consigue explicar a la perfección y con mucha claridad un juego de esta características. Y hay que decir que, aunque es un juego denso con muchas reglas, después cuando sabes jugar te das cuenta de que es muy fácil y fluye sin problemas. Otra historia es saber jugar bien... Otro punto a favor es su nuevo diseño gráfico respecto a la primera edición ya que éste es mucho más bonito y agradable a la vista.

En definitiva, no le pongo un 10 a este juego porque creo que no se lo voy a poner a ninguno. Pero con Through the Ages me lo estoy pensando mucho y puede que cuando pase un tiempo le acabe poniendo un 10 de nota.

Best game I've ever played. Played at 2 Bo31's in 4 day intervals as well as generally weekly games.  So much scope. Says 180-240mins playing time. That is absolute rubbish if you have any clue what you are doing. Time ranges (after you have played a lot):
2 player 20- 70 mins 
3 player 30 -90 mins
4 player 40 - 120 mins

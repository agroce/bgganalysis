1st play: a fairly unique theme with the main game being to run out and buy games and then return to your car. Trying to predict the hotness and play testing is included here. Mostly the gameplay is very repetitive from round to round and lots of randomness to overcome. It's probably actually a decent simulation of an Essen experience.

This may be tainted by winning, but I enjoyed the game. I felt like I had a plan and I pulled it off. Maybe I got extremely lucky as I was able to fulfill a lot more than everyone else for big points at the end. I assumed everyone at the table was very close to completing all (10) like I did, but I think the next highest was 6.

The game definitely isn't anything revolutionary or exciting, but it was enjoyable to me. I felt like I was able to make a plan, execute the plan with some struggles, and get to the end with a win.

This should have been about why the Allies didn't bomb Essen more during 1943-45. Now they torture us with stupid games for low IQ people. Call it redistribution not of wealth, but stupidity upon the minds of decent people. I hope the people of Essen are enjoying their tight orange or red pants.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (September 2016)

Since its release, I was very keen to play ESSEN The Game: SPIEL'13. There has been some games that feature boardgames as their theme, some of them I love (Time´s Up Geek edition, Ludoviel), some I dislike (The BoardGameGeek Game) so I was sorely disappointed in the game :cry:, it broke my heart :(.

The theme is awesome and the best feature of the game.

The art is ok, great cover though. The game components are ok as well. I love to see many of my beloved games in play :D. The entry tickets (to decide first player at the beginning) are nice but totally superfluous.

The English rulebook is very regular, it needs to be re redacted for clarity, as it is right now it has a weird redaction. It is confusing in many parts, for example they explain a lot of the function ONLY in the material description. In the material description they said you have to do an intermediate scoring at midday, but then later they refer to the same scoring as the morning ranking cards. At first I thought they were separate scorings. Other example, sometimes it refers to victory points as wining points and sometimes they use victory points. There are typos (like symbole). Actually, the rules are very easy to teach once you decipher the rulebook. You can do it under 10 minutes.

It plays (mercifully) fast. Around 100 minutes with the full complement of players.

The decisions needed to play the game are very light, basically where to go, what to buy and when to come back to your car (they are painfully obvious). There is an incredible high luck factor (a huge minus for me) in many ways: 

1.	How new games arrive thus deciding arbitrarily the value of a game.
2.	With the event tokens, some games will be discounted, some will flop, some are the buzz and you have no way to mitigate it
3.	The worst offender are the wish list cards. You can “playtest” a game to get more wish list cards and they can easily decide the winner of the game, if he is lucky. Besides, there is no point to do a draft at the beginning of the game with these cards. The games aren’t on the table YET! So the strategy of all players was to take the cards by color! It would be a lot faster and practically the same to give the players the cards at random since the beginning.
4.	At first I liked the morning goal cards, but after the midday scoring new goal cars appear in the game, These should be visible right from the start. It is luck that decides if the previous bought games will be of use with these new goals (in my game I couldn’t score any afternoon goal, it was impossible due to luck). Perhaps this is the way the game was intended to play, but I’m not sure because the rules doesn’t say (but I don’t think so), it only says “place the afternoon cards symbole in the side of the board”.
5.	The crowd tokens appear randomly and they can wreak havoc with your strategy. There is also considerable luck here.

To summarize, ESSEN The Game: SPIEL'13 has A LOT of uncontrollable luck and I hate this part of the game.

The movement mechanism is novel and thematic. You can move less if you are carrying more game, perhaps the most interesting decision in the game is to know how many boardgames can you buy before getting back to your car. 

I was expecting a heavier game, after all Bruxelles 1893´s designer (Etienne Espreman) also co designed ESSEN The Game: SPIEL'13 and I really like Bruxelles 1893. ESSEN The Game: SPIEL'13 is more of a light game, perhaps it is good for families, but that part also disappointed me. It is funny that there is a “family version” in the rules, the game is very light as it is.

I´m very disappointed, this was supposed to be the good Essen game (I bought the two of them) but it is a bad game for me.

Bottom line, I love the theme and that´s about it! ESSEN The Game: SPIEL'13  has a lot of uncontrollable luck, a confusing rulebook and features boring an obvious gameplay. As I was so hyped about it, I´m sorely disappointed in it :cry: I already sold it and if I never play it again I won’t be sad.

Good solid game, and I am frankly surprised to see it not get more attention here on the Geek compared to many of the supposedly "hot" 2014 Essen releases that fell rather flat for me.  It is not a gimmick, it's a game that does well as a simulation that befits the theme of a harried shopper in the crowds at the world's largest gaming convention:  How do I plan my trip to the hall and back to the car to unload more games, grabbing a quick snack to replenish my energy, watching the polls to see what games I need to add to collection while also fulfilling the wishlist items for even more bonus points.  Totally engaging, light to medium weight game that should be the part of everyone's collection, IMHO.

Questo gioco è una vigliaccata, specula sui sentimenti di noi giocatori, ci deride e ci fa il verso proprio in uno dei momenti più importanti dell'anno, ovvero la mitica Fiera Internazionale del Gioco in Scatola di ESSEN. Il gioco in se non offre particolari elementi innoviativi, è un gioco ad azioni che ha il merito di ricordare molto fedelmente le dinamiche, le contraddizioni e gli avvenimenti che contraddistinguono la fiera. Ed eccoci quindi con la nostra wishlist, con gli stand presi d'assalto alla ricerca di goodies o giochi ormai sold out, giochi presi in preorder e le immancabili file da imbottigliamento per troppa ressa, o lo zaino che diventa troppo pesante e allora le carse alla macchina per scaricare i giochi acquiatati, magari un nuovo prelievo al bancomat e poi ancora dentro nella magica fiera di Essen!

Very thematic game!! It´s even more thematic than some fantasy/sci-fi board games are. Simulates the Essen fair fever very well, at least the game hunting process and fun. I really love that they have used real publishers and games not some generic ones so this feels even more immersive and realistic. The game gets a bit too long with 5 players though.. so maybe 4 players woul be optimal.

 The theme of this game is you run your marker around the Essen board game convention buying board games. The more games you buy, the slower you walk in a turn. The game tiles show pictures of the games released in 2013. In some cases the theme hurt me, because you are rewarded for buying games you have a matching card for (thematically called your "wantlist".) This made me want to travel in time and stop me from buying certain titles. Other pictures of games reminded me of games I'd rather have been playing than this one. All that aside, if I ignore the theme, the game was an enjoyable pickup and deliver romp.

Played at Essen 2014. Before playing it I was very excited and curious about this definitely nice game idea! But playing it let me quite cold. Maybe one positive aspect is that you discuss about the games that are available ingame and have nice talks about them. But that can not be the aim of this game ... although it makes this game a bit more thematic and geeky!

This game wasn't really on my radar. It sounded too much like a gimmick and the art is ugly. But when I get the chance to play a game from the designer of [thing=144592][/thing], how could I pass that up?
I must say that this is a solid design. You run around buying games. And you can play tactical or strategic in what you buy. But I have one big problem with the game: if you want to be strategic, you have to buy games from your wishlist. But there is nothing you can do about it when someone else buys that game for tactical reasons. And there is only one of each game. So you can try to buy your wishlist, but it might not work out and there isn't really anything you can do about that. This problem is magnified by the end game scoring: you score big, really big, for having a lot of games off of your wishlist. But if you can hardly plan for that, is it really strategic or just luck?
So I thought it was a good game, but that end game scoring rubbed me the wrong way.
One more thought: so whatever is on no one's wish list is on everyone's wishlist?

I have to admit that the theme of running around a board game convention buying games is one that appeals to me. And the fact that real publishers and real games from the 2013 Essen Spiel were used added a nice touch to the game. Although that also dates the game.

What I found most interesting about this game was the movement mechanic, where empty spaces in your bag are your available actions for the turn, and buying a game decreases how many actions you can take on a turn. Figuring out how to manage your inventory until you can make it back to your car and dump your games off is tricky. One player in our game went deep into the convention and bought as many games as he could carry which ended up crippling him. He spent the last three turns of the game waddling back to his car, but never quite got there. That effectively meant that he couldn't score any more points and wasted the second half of the game accomplishing nothing. Lesson learned: think about whether you can really afford to get laden down or not.

Outside of the interesting movement/action mechanic, the game is a fairly standard exercise in point maximization. Buy the cheapest game that gives you the most points. Except that you have goal cards that make you want certain games in particular. And there are public goals for having certain types of games in particular quantities.

It's not the best game in the world, but it's interesting and pleasant enough.

Easy enough for anyone to play, but probably not for those unfamiliar with the titles on offer. There's a solid game in there but you may not quite know why the rest of us are laughing our asses off. I usually wouldn't buy a game I couldn't run with anyone, but essentially anyone who games with Rok or I long enough will play a ton of these games.

This game was the first big box game that we backed on kickstarter. Strange, because most of the time we won’t buy new games, as we like to wait a little while until the price drops. But as said back then, it wasn’t sure yet if this game was to be published after the kickstarter campaign (great marketing trick isn’t it?). Another thing, is the fact that we bought this game, just because of the theme, also something we almost never do. And we didn’t playtest the game before we bought it. For a bigbox game this is another unique thing. Combining those three reasons (Kickstarter, theme, no playtesting), and you might understand that the expectations on this game were not very high. About one month after picking this game up at Spiel 14, I started the read the rules and setting up the games. The translation of the rules aren’t that great, but finally I understood them, and I was able to explain this, not too difficult game, in about 10 minutes. Each player starts with 8 Action Points (AP), which are showed as a track on the board. He can use those to move around the convention (1 AP, per step), or playtest a game (1 AP). He can also buy a game (0 AP), Load bought games into his car (0 AP), withdraw money from the ATM (0 AP) or rest at the cafetaria (-2 AP). When moving through the halls, some parts of the halls will be filled with a big crowd. Of course moving in a crowded area, is hard, and therefore moving in a crowd will cost you 2 AP per step. When you buy a game, you pay money and will earn points for the game, based on the popularity of the game on BGG, Tric Trac and Fair Play. You put the game in one of your bags. By doing that, you will also loose 1 AP, as your bags are shown on the AP track on the board. So the more games you have bought, the heavier you get, the harder it will become to move around the convention.

After playing it, we were very surprised by the game. We really enjoyed it, and we got the feeling that we were at Spiel again. Big help for this, is the fact that all the publisher logos and the pictures of the game are real ones as they were used at Spiel 13. Also the location of the publishers in the halls are pretty accurate, and if you’ve been to Spiel, this will help to recognize things and bring back some memories. But also if you never have been to Spiel, this is a nice game. It’s pretty tactical. Basically it’s a pick up and deliver game with some set collection management in it. If you like those kind of games, you will have a nice one with this game. And the exclusivity? Well, I guess if the game was successful enough, there will be a ESSEN The Game: SPIEL’14.

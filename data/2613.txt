A very solid solitaire game!  Based on the die rolls and circumstances, it can either be a very tense game or a very easy game, but overall, it is a very good one worth coming back to over and over.  It has a few weaknesses, but using the resources of this website clarifies them.  Another fine offering from Task Force's pocket game series.  I haven't played them all, but those I have played have been consistently above-average games and this is one of their better offerings.

RATING: 5
Solitaire game based on the movie Alien. Good for the story that is generated while playing but as a game it gets pretty predictable. Either the intruder doesn't change quickly enough and the crew is easily able to capture and contain it or the intruder morphs into an unstoppable mega beast and you have to hope that it doesn't have the right combination of powers to make it unstoppable. Games that fall somewhere in that interesting middle area seem too few to bother trying to play again. The rules are also a little convoluted by modern standards but not too difficult.

Capture the favor of the first "Aliens" movie quite well.  You run around trying to contain and possibly destroy the Intruder while it morph and change into something more nasty. Picked up a second copy with Asteriod Zero-Four.

Love this game. It does nothing more than what it promises, but that's just fine. A great way to spend a free hour, and unpredictable enough for great replay value. A little too easy for the humans to win, but there are variants rules here that help with that. Some have pointed out that it is a shameless take-off of "Alien", but don't forget, it has a "Marines go back to the site" scenario 5 years ahead of "Aliens" :)

RATING: 8
Fun solitaire romp in which the player controls nine crew members of a research station attempting to capture (at first) an alien life form gone amock.  The game is sometimes too easy but the implementation of house rules corrects this to a certain degree.  Basically, a classical assymetrical situation in which one power unit is running amuck, and players must decide between concentrating their forces (to increase punch in combat) and dispersing them (to increase the chances of finding the enemy)...and the clock is ticking because with each passing turn, there is a chance that the enemy will morph into something more powerful.

Holy crap, this is probably typical for games of the era, but the rules are so convoluted with so many minor details, it made the game no fun at all.  The concept seemed fun, but having to reference the rule book every time I do something is not fun at all.  I played through three turns, and just decided to pack it up since the game seemed like more work than it was worth.  I'll avoid games of this genre from now on.  Also, as an aside, WHY DID THEY MAKE THE INTRUDER CHITS BRIGHT ORANGE!?!  When playing on a the white board, it is impossible to not see which chit is the Intruder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good for a game made in 1980.  Wish had a copy back then, would have loved it.  It does show some age because of too much time is devoted to fiddly game system management:

* roll dice for "intruder known powers,"(I use deck of cards 2 through queen of clubs) and reroll if you get the same value.

* You have to roll for like nine hidden units for movement

Still great fun for a game from the 80's.  Would make a great java/flash game.

A really fun game that was really damaged by the red alien counter.  The alien, in addition to a number of loose animals, wander the board.  They are all placed face down, to hide which one is the alien, but the curvature of the chits makes it impossible to NOT notice which one is the alien, because it's a different color.  Other than that, it's a fun little game.

Excellent solo game.  If I have the time, [b]The Vesuvius Incident[/b] is much more cinematic, but I can play multiple games of [b]Intruder[/b] in an hour.  Sometimes it ends very quickly.  Sometimes the damn thing keeps cloning, killing, and escaping.

The red front of the intruder chits kept reflecting on the white map while moving them, giving away the alien's location, and requiring mixing them up.  Now I use glass beads to show the location of unknown creatures and then draw from a cup when encountering.  Works great.

(Rating is based upon my feable memory of over two decades past) Good enough that I seem to remember just about wearing out a copy playing solo.  I seem to remember a randomed set of alien abilities that added a ton of replay that would not have been in the game otherwise.  Game's limited scope and (as always) crappy components limited the rating more than anything else.  But for the price, darn hard to beat.

Another game based on ALIEN or--if you're a REAL sci-fi junkie/fan--THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD.  This one is better than most not only in the handling of it's theme, but in the age of "microgames".  It can even be played as a solitare game--which I did, several times, when I didn't have $2.95 for another microgame or $20 for an AH "bookcase" game.

The Good: This is a fun solo game. This game excels at creating a story as you play. Great atmospere. If you are looking for a theme similar to the movie Aliens, this is the game for you. It also appears to have good replayability. I was a little concerned that the game might turn out to be too easy to beat, but the first game I got slaughtered ! Furthermore, it is easy to make the game harder. In addition, there are several variations out there. 

The Bad: Rules complexity is definitely a step up from German games, but not too bad.

I like Intruder because I like the type of conflict that it simulates, just as I like Awful Green Things and Wreck of the BSM Pandora.  I further feel that Intruder's heart is in the right place.  It seriously simulates the struggle for survival in a confined space with hostile monsters.  It's also fun and you feel fear for your little crewpersons.  Production quality is acceptable, apart from the crippling problem with face-down Intruder counters that others have mentioned.  But there is no play balance.  If you play a few times, you will (a) realize that you have never lost; and (b) think of a few simple strategies to ensure that you never do lose.

Fantastic game. Simple but great solo mechanic. It nails the feel of the movie Alien. Use some other counters or markers for the alien/lab animal counters (otherwise the red reflects and give away the location of the alien). This game has great replay value. Each game can feel very different. If the intruder starts cloning you are in for a heck of a battle. Given the price this is a great value.

A cute little game in the Aliens mode.  Not as atmospheric as The Vesuvius Incident, but much easier (and quicker) to play.  Won my first game as the crew with +10 points with a quick caging after a sleep dart with only one crew casualty.  Very slow metamorphosis for the Intruder may make it hard for it to win, but can't say after only one game.  Looking forward to playing again.

Fun little solo game that's a generic 'Alien' game. It's old school and the counters have the worst artwork of all time, but the game is fun as hell. Be prepared for a terrible rule book, but once you get it straight the game is pretty darn entertaining. I played it through a few times and then traded it. The replay vaule is there as the various mutations show up differently. If the the intruder splits and you get clones you're screwed.

Players are scientists battling a mutating creature that is loose on board the space station. Pure co-op, although since there are 9(?) characters to control in every game, it might be better solo.

This rating is based on playing the game twice so take it with a grain of salt.  I loved alien, and was really hoping for a good game in that genre.  This game isn't.  First there is the luck element, if the alien rolls well it gets cool powers quickly, if not, it is pretty hosed.  Some of the mechanics are just broke, I am told that there is an official errata sheet that fixes the game somewhere, it certainly needs it.  This feels like there might be a game in there somewhere with enough redesign and work.  I've got tired of buying half baked games that have to be rebuilt to be made playable.

My copy is very worn, after more than two decades of frequent play. There are other games with the exact same theme, like The Awful Green Things and The Vesuvius Incident, but none of them captured the feel of the Alien movies better than this microgame, even with it's typo-laden rulebook and C-quality components. The map is functional and yet evocative, and the life cycle chart and the unknown powers combine to make this a suspenseful game every time. The chrome is just enough to add to the theme without adding burdensome rules.

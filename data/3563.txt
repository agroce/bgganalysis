Very good game.  Simple, quick, yet a good sense of strategy.  Also, I think it captures the feel of Middle-Earth quite well.  Works well as a points match game OR the scenarios, which are a lot of fun

RATING: 6
It's a skirmish game, but the FOTR version isn't as polished as the TT or ROTK versions.   Model selection is weird too- you can't really play any of the enclosed scenarios without buying more miniatures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
As far as tabletop fantasy miniatures, these are the best looking, the rule set is ok (A little character heavy though), and the fluff (the novels) are a wonderful background to the whole thing.  I also like how there is a clear distinction between who are the good guys and who are evil.

Excellent skirmish scale tabletop game.  Rules are simple and intuitive.  Very nice models.

This is one of my favorite miniatures battle game. I have approximately 200 of the figures painted and another 400 unpainted.

RATING: 5
Well, I got sucked in. And of course, just before Sabertooth's "Clicky"-style version came out! Never mind. While while I have a love/hate relationship with painting figures, I can't deny the stunning quality of the figures, their awesome variety, and staggering amount of support available for the game-- so far. While I may never be a fan of the GW _game,_ I certainly see myself taking the figs into HeroQuest games, or maybe used in an Epic Duels variant, or perhaps even as part of a Fantasy Battle Cry set. I just have to find a way to get the materials at a reasonable discount-- or maybe even used...

Have played the skirmish game. It's okay. Heroes definitely offer more dimension and context to your battles. I think Griping Beast's SAGA game is a faster battle game and just as good.

RATING: 8
This is the best game that comes out of GW today.  The rules are fun and place a lot of emphasis on the Heroes, just like (I imagine) Tolkien would have liked.  The line has a ton of consistency amongst all of its minis, and they look and feel incredibly coherent.  I enjoy the game and the figures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
I love this game as a skirmish game. If I could paint, I would, but I still enjoy the game. My complaint, is that none of the three boxed sets come with any of the hero figures. You'll get plenty of men, elves, orks, goblins and urks. Some of the heroes are expensive, but well worth it. If you need an opening into miniture war gaming, and you enjoy Lord of the Rings, you should give this one a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a skirmish-level game.  All figures are single individuals, with good or bad heroes with great influence on the out come of the battle.  Great figures by Game Workshop, but other lines are available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
UPDATE: Well, some 5 years later, there now are many, many cheaper (but still very high-quality) plastic figures available and you don't have to spend a ton of money on the game the way you used to. The core system has been simplified and streamlined and is now a great game. And the addition of the Legions point-buy system is a great scearnio aid.

The legendary scenario balance problems still exist (the "second edition" of the Fellowship of the Ring book was absolutely horrid), but are not as frequent, thankfully. The only other issue is that I wish the game were less wedded to the movies. The line has moved on and given us some geat stuff for Dwarves and Arnor, just to mention two, but the Orcs still look like guys in prosthetics, not like Tolkienesque Orcs, and Aragorn is an overrated killing machine. Meanwhile Gandalf and the Ringwraiths seem weak.
---
Surprisingly fun. The game is pretty decent, and Games Workshop provides a plethora of excellent material to get you into the whole miniatures-painting thing gently (and it should be said, if you don't enjoy the painting, the game will not be good value). Once I got going I found the painting to be fun and not hard to get very nice results. The plastic figures are a nice way to get into the game cheaply, although you will almost certainly want to buy the Fellowship boxed set and a Cave Troll, and possibly the Weathertop set also if you get into it. Once you get sucked in, though, the sky is the limit on what you can spend ... I wish there was more plastic. The Two Towers set has more  plentiful plastic, and the scenarios are a huge improvement over the Fellowship game, although they require more units generally (I haven't played a loser scnenario from TTT yet, while the FotR scenarios, while some were still interesting, were more or less completely unbalanced).

RATING: 4
Have to disagree with the crowd here!, Compared to the rest of GW's games this is dire and a sad waste of the LOTR's license. Too difficult for beginners and too lacking in scope to keep long term gamers interested, also the investment needed to give you are varied or wide ranging game would be a great deal. If you have money too burn and an interest in mediocre games buy this!

I was drawn into this game (and subsequently the hobby of painting) because of my enthusiasm for Tolkien. Games Workshop's miniatures are among the best, and I remain glad that the LoTR minis are static scale.

However, as a game, I find the combat-rules fiddly and regularly unbalanced. Also dislike GW's pricing policies and legal pursuits.

A decent wargame.  The problem lies in normal troop-on-troop combat: it takes forever!  The good side relies on heroes to do their killing, and the evil side relies on monsters.  However, any game where one can kill Hobbits has very redeeming properties!

Great hobby, not as much of a game (I just don't like the scarcity of opponents).  The gameplay itself can be totally immersive, but you need to be prepared to at least read the rulebook (where all the player stats are kept) a few times for accounting purposes.  Playing with the heroes makes it even more complex, but I have never played a game of this that wasn't fun.

Actually this game is quite good. Fairly simple compared to Warhammer but that allows for some strategy elements. The figs are of course amazing and like GW&#039;s other games its much more a hobby then just a game which of course is not what everyone accepts from such a game. But if you get into painting the mini&#039;s and creating some terrain the game is very attractive and you really get to play out the Lord of the Rings adventures.

Boiled down version of Warhammer essentially, which rides merrily on the franchise bandwagon. I wish GW had given this amazing license the original attention and individual flavour it deserved. Well, I guess selling more minis was more on the agenda. For Shame.

RATING: 2
If you are anything but a beginner wargamer, stay far away. Basically just boils down to rolling dice at each other and the highest score wins. GW screwed over the people that played this game since release also, forcing you to buy 3 "starter sets" to get the rules (which they rereleased each time a movie came out) at $40 each. If you want to play fantasy miniature wargames, try Warhammer Fantasy Battle, Fantasy Rules!, Armies of Arcana or Hordes of the Things.

In combat, both fighters roll a d6 and the higher roll hits the foe. Some call this elegant, others call it elementary school. It is rather fun but after a few battles I found myself wanting to move beyond the system.
Miniatures and theme are terrific in any case.

the combat system in this game is fantastic with just a touch of extras with hero abilities.  Games Workshop's best game by far considering its not about whomever rolls more dice in a turn wins like their other 2 games...  it can be an expensive game to play though

This one grew on me.  I'd never considered 25mm miniatures before this.  Splitting the buying and painting of lead with a friend or two can really cut the costs associated with this manufacturer.  This is a tactical ruleset geared for cinematic effect of vignettes from the storyline; don't assume any printed scenario is balanced.  GW balancing policy tends to assume that each player has figured out the optimal style or tactics ahead of time; otherwise you can have a long setup time and disappointingly crushing curbstomp instead of a close game.
I have moved over to the mass battle rules published as War of the Ring.  It requires a larger model collection but is much more balanced and less likely to disappoint a gamer who's schlepped the 100+ models for his side to play.  Don't cheese out on Galadrim and wizards and it's a fun game for both sides.

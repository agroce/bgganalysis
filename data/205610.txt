LIKE: Interesting selection mechanism.
DISLIKE: Decisions are obvious.

OVERALL: Seems interesting but the obvious moves hold it back. The bonus cards can add a bit of a twist. Would like to play more, but being so light, it is difficult to get the more serious gamers interested.

Fun, but it's a super simple, abstract, set collection game that tries to capitalize on the game of thrones IP, not to say that it's bad, it really isn't (but its not great either) it just doesn't have much to do with the works of George R. R. Martin (come on man finish the book, Ive been waiting for 6 years for book 6). I guess that if you use the companion cards, and I recommend you do so, the theme shows up a little, but that is it. I enjoy playing it, but I like abstracts in general, if that is your case, go fot it, if it's theme you are seeking, steer away.

Updated to 9 from a previous 8.
Excellent for school breaks. A favourite among my students.
A liitle puzzle by master Cathala, where in a lot of games the first player has a little advantage. If he knows how to play.
I wish there were more companion cards. 14 seem a few after 3 dozen games.

Easily my most played game in the last three months.
And this says a lot

The game is a harmless way to pass a few minutes, which is the best I can say about it. It's so light it's almost a non-game. Hey That's My Fish! is a much more interesting take on similar mechanics. The cards are flimsy and not very attractive, but I suppose I'd rather a game like this be as cheap as possible.

This game is a lot more fun than you might think. The artwork is fantastic too. It's very reminiscent of a cleaner Michael Avon Oeming in terms of style and does a good job of mixing book descriptions of characters with tv show depictions. 

I've played it as 2 players, 3 players and 4. All play well but I would say the best way to play it is 2 player. In a 2 player game it's very chess like. you're focusing on a strategy to complete houses whilst trying to stop the other player from doing so. 
With more than 2 players it's all but impossible to complete a single house so just becomes more about getting the most tokens.

What a great little game, such a slick design, I've been VERY happy with this game, it is just so easy to get to the table. My non-gamer friends have mostly responded with a "meh" reaction, but my gamer friends love it. It's a highly tactical game, and while there is long term strategy, I find reacting and being an opportunist can be more valuable. I am very bad at this game, but my wife loves it and she wins like every game she plays with everyone. A great experience in a little box, and the theme really helps IMHO.

The latter turns are very obvious.  So, a 10-15 minute game really seems to be over in 5 minutes with the most exciting turns taking place at the beginning.  Another smaller issue is the randomness of the variable power character cards.  Depending on how the game goes, it's pretty likely that a couple of these become irrelevant, which drastically reduces the excitement level (but this can be house ruled).   I'd play it again, but I wouldn't be upset if the opportunity never arose.

RATING: 8
A fun, abstract card game that uses card movements to collect sets (of prominent Game of Thrones families). You move Varys around to garner favor with the other characters so they support your becoming the Hand of the King. You can even play it 3 or 4 players. 4 players has teams of 2. To strengthen the theme, players can use 3-eyed raven tokens to walk off to the side and collude against the other player(s). It's fun and fast. Takes up a decent amount of table space for being such a simple game, though.

A filler game that is quick, tactical and fun. I think it would work best as a 2 player game, 4 player games really rely on everyone making sure to not set up the next person whereas a 2 player game would have more longer term planning. 

Fun, quick and for $13 MSRP, not a bad game at all! Great filler!

RATING: 7
Hand of the King is a quick playing, mostly perfect information abstract that comes in a small box. I say mostly, because there is one companion card that introduces luck of the draw. You start the game with a 6 x 6 grid of characters. One of those characters is Varys, who players will take turns moving to collect characters of the various houses of Westeros. Some of these are anti-thematic (why is Aegon I in the same grid as Theon Greyjoy?). If at the end of the turn, you control equal to or more characters than your opponent in a specific house, you take a banner of that house. The player with the most banners at the end of the game wins. When someone takes the last card of a house, they use one of the 6 companion cards that is off to the side of the grid. These generally have some powerful and thematic effects (Drogo takes Dany and kills Viserys). The game ends when Varys is incapable of taking a character with his movement.

This is a great, inexpensive 2-player game. You can play this one up to 4. With 4, I believe you can play partnerships or individuals. I've only played it as a 2-player so far. I really like that they used the cartoony fan-artwork that I had previously seen by an artist on Facebook. It's a fun game, and a bit more thinky than you might imagine. It's also nice that they included more companion cards than what's needed in the game, to increase variability. The only negative I can really say is that the random set-up can really favour the 1st player sometimes. I'd strongly recommend allowing the second player to swap Varys with any other card in the grid, before the 1st player starts. If you get this game, I'd also recommend replacing the Varys card (after setup) with a pawn... or this:

RATING: 6
A simple game that I could definitely play more of - it feels like it should be solvable /with luck, but you still get to make some interesting choices. Cards are thematic and tie into the show well, but really it's an abstract game that could have any theme. Maybe too quick for what it wants to be? Have only played 2 player, it likely plays very differently with more.
Oh, and my Mom enjoyed it despite not having seen any GoT (which was hilarious, particularly when she was calling the Greyjoys the Gregorys, etc)

Actually, I enjoyed this quite a bit more than I thought I would.  The package suggests this might be a light, almost throwaway filler.  But there is some interesting abstract/spatial gameplay going on here and a nice, confrontational challenge between you and a couple of opponents.  The character cards are so amusing and actually a little awesome actually!  Their special effects often relate closely to the character.  (For example, Jaqen kills three characters; Hodor finds Bran, etc.)  This feels like a game that must simply have existed before and just got a re-skin, but not at all.  A fresh new game from Bruno Cathala in a small box with a great theme!  The artwork is cartoony but works just fine for a game like this.  Really, not a lot of depth to this one but that's fine. It's a good time for fans of GoT and solidly constructed filler games!

As Varys, gather the most influence in the biggest number of families to become the Hand of the King. Every turn you move orthogonally to pick up a character and all its family members found along the way. Every time a family is fully removed from the board, you can pick up and use a special character card (from outside the board).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 4p team rules were unexpectedly fascinating because of the way ties work; if two people have the same number of cards in one family, they both take over that crest at the end of each of their turns, and all that matters is who has it when the game ends. So you can end up caring very much which member of the other team you're tied with, and our entire game came down to that; not really sure what it would be like for two players!

It might be an 8 if the special power cards ("companions"?) were easier to instantly grasp; looking back and forth to figure out which of the many (otherwise identical) grey cards a given companion let you steal is not fun.

Update: I'm told the 4p rule that so fascinated me was a mistake. Now I don't know what I think of the game.

RATING: 6
A decent quick filler that lives from the theme. Fighting for majorities of House Stark, Targaryen or Lannister is much more appealing then getting the most green or red cards. The pleasant illustration style adds to the appeal.

Gameplay itself is simple and subject to heavy player-binding. The decision which cards to get can take a backseat to the consideration of how to avoid leaving a good position for the other players. If a player doesn’t care what the next player gets, Hand of the King degenerates into a random victory generator. A few take-that event cards add theme to the mix but some of them can be kingmakers.

Nonetheless, I would play again as it’s not much longer than a game of Love Letter with a comparable amount of influence and enough potential for Game of Thrones trash talk.

Ez egy absztrakt játék, a téma meg olyan, amilyen. Szerintem itt nem fájó ez a "bőr", és ad egy érdekesebb hangulatot a játéknak, mintha mondjuk csak színes számozott kártyák lennének. Szóval jobb, mint amire számítottam. :)

Quick to set up, only real downside is it needs a big table.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Might work better as a two player or partnership game but I was last player and never felt like I could make a move to even sniff the lead. Now perhaps that was due to the randomness of the setup in this game but I don't really need to play again and find out. Just not enough to keep me interested. Besides, I'm well aware that everyone dies in Game of Thrones but in this particular game only one noble died? What's up with that? I also am not a fan of the art although others at the table did like the art.

This game isn't going to blow anyone away with any revolutionary mechanics, and it isn't going to be crowned jewel in anyone's collection. What it will do though is give you 5-10 min of gaming fun in a really great looking small package. I loved that FFG went with the artist style that they did with this game which really makes it stand out. The mechanics are drop-dead simple, and can be explained in a couple of minutes. After that you and your group can break it out whenever you are waiting for more people to stop by to play something longer. All in all it is a really great filler game.

Straight forward filler that has a little bit to think about each turn.  Very tactical game play since you want to make sure you're not setting your opponent up for a great turn.    The companion cards help make each play feel a bit different.

A really quick and simple set collection game that does a good job of capturing the theme in a fun and family friendly manner.

A pretty dull set collection game. Has elements of games like Hey! That's My Fish and Ninja Camp, but isn't as interesting in execution. The one thing that gives this game some individuality is with the companion cards, which are either very swingy, or they are about useless. Silly artwork is about all the good I can say for this one.

RATING: 7
There are a lot of surprisingly tough decisions to make in such a simple game.  The amount of scheming you can do with other players to prevent someone from getting what they want is fun and thematic!

EDIT: Fun game, but not getting played enough to justify holding on to it.

ok filler. Little luck need in the turn order. Thematic the special action cards seem to make sense when you have seen Game of Thrones the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Probably too simple, and your game too dependent on where the player before you leaves the Varys card. You can move it from where it is up or down or right or left, and take cards belonging to the set it lands on and that it moved over. If you get cards in sets you want that are winnable, excellent. If you don't, sucks to be you. And that's the gist of it. Ideally you want to leave Varys where it's less useful for the next player, but you won't sacrifice your own turn to do so. Meaning the game is what it is ... a light playable filler that at least has a decision to make each turn, but you can't afford to be overly invested.

A good filler game of a more viscous Hey That's My Fish.  There was a Chess like feel to the game to not setup others for getting specific house cards.  Bonus is that the game is a favorite theme.

The other GoT game I played! Really simple set collection and abstract tile game. Not a fan of the art and wish they used real photography from the show. Basically I like photography better and wish more games had photography. :P A game that I will likely pick up for the theme alone and see it gets played  a bunch. Super fast 10 minute filler and I think people will enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At its core, it's a neat positional abstract driving majority-scored set-collection. But 6 special power cards (chosen from 14 each game) spice things up and provide the big moments, as well as most of the theme. A very smart little 15 minutes which I enjoyed both as a head-to-head and in the 2v2 partnership form.

Wow. Packs quite a punch for such a fast (15-20 min) game. Tough decisions right from the outset. Sidesteps potential deterministic issues with the special abilities of support characters earned for closing out houses. Evocative artwork is perfect for the weight and theme.

A standard move-the-neutral-piece-then-claim-what-it-lands-on.  I've seen many versions of that framework, and they all suffer the same issue.  2 player: it's too solvable.  3+ player: it's purely greed and luck.

This rendition has hope at 3, with the option to negotiate.  However, there is no currency for bribes and little ability to help the player before you in turn order, so I'm not optimistic that it will good.  But I can't be sure.  2 player (or 4 player teams) don't solve the basic issues of this genre.

Thematically, it's cute but not a good match for GoT.  Houses get divided against themselves, and the Starks are most likely to be the most divided and the least worth fighting over.  That sounds like a political game, but not GoT.

Interesting little card game, that's really mostly set collection. It reminds me of Kupfelkessel Co, an out-of-print two-player classic. What makes this a bit more interesting, is that the distribution of the families (sets) are uneven, and a couple of the various families have special powers. It's got enough in there that I'm happy to play this anytime. I'm sure if I watched the show, my rating might even go up a bit more.

RATING: 5
This is a simple game of collecting characters from the popular book/television series to claim the houses and have the most houses by game end.  A 6x6 grid of characters (with pretty good fun caricature-like art) is laid out and players take turns moving Varys in an orthogonal direction and collecting all the characters passed over from a single house.  If you have the most or tie for the previous holder of that house you claim the banner.  When Varys can no longer move the player with the most banners wins.

Super duper simple and I didn't feel like there was a ton of strategy in it.  You almost always want to make the move that earns you the most ground but also have to consider the next player's move.  I think this makes it best as a 2-player game but even then, it is a little too simple and random for me.

First impression: pretty good game. It plays in under 20 minutes but has enough going on to keep it interesting. The 4-player team game actually seems interesting but I haven't tried it yet.

There's a start player advantage, I'm just not sure how significantly it effects the game yet. It may be best to play multiple games, alternating the start player each time, and have a "best of" winner at the end.

Update: This is good stuff. Still haven't tried the team game, but it seems promising.

My fave filler. Far more strategy than at first seems with the companion cards, allowing you to set up some nice combos depending on which companions are in the game. I found the companion cards to be extremely thematic to anyone who knows the IP. I also like the soft look of the game which doesn't take itself too seriously. Would recommend that the player who goes 2nd (or last if more than 2) gets to reposition Varys before the game starts (helps with balance). Unexpected Gem.

This is moderately entertaining as a two-player exercise, maybe even clever. As a four-player game, it is awful. With more players it becomes very easy to play a whole game without having a single decision to make, because often you will be stuck with only one direction to move whether you want to or not. The last four-player game I was in I literally did not get a turn that wasn't a predetermined one-way street.

The art is also way out of whack for a Game of Thrones. That sort of thing doesn't normally bother me and it doesn't really here...except it's such a cartoon of a game that the art makes me take it even less seriously. I'm not likely to play this one too much more, as it just doesn't connect with me for anything I call fun.

[i]Rating after one 4-player game[/i]

This is clearly a game designed with 2 players in mind. There's no strategy in picking cards from the grid when playing with full player count. You just try to make the best move you can when your turn comes around and try not to set up any good move for the next player (and still, despite your best efforts, if your opponents play poorly, they might still throw the game to someone else and there's nothing you can do about it). I imagine that Hand of the King becomes more "chess-like" with 2, with much more control over your strategy and movement on the grid. But I won't play this game again with 4, it's a waste of time.

Gyors kis setgyűjtögetős filler, melyben a GoT-ból megismert családtagokból kell Varyssal a lehető legtöbbet összeszednünk. Amennyiben egy családból az utolsó is kikerül a játékból, a plusz segítőkből is választhatunk egyet, melyek különböző hatással bírnak.
A játék alapvetően kétfős, de van lehetőség csapatban négyen is játszani, ez utóbbi elég erőltetett, találni akkor már jobb fillert is ekkora létszámra.

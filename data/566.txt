This game is really interesting. Some people hate the art but I think it looks really cool. Once you figure out what's going on, it's a neat game. I think it has been hurt ratings wise by the "weird theme and art". Do yourself a favor, give this one a try!

NICE!  After a single game I can see the complexities and tough coices in this one shining through.  I struggled in the early game but caught on and made a last minute run for the lead.  Unfortunately I'd skipped on the singles and ended up letting two of the guys sneak past me when It came time to count cards.  Excellent game, I hope I'll get to play this one again soon.

RATING: 6
Played the so-called "advanced version."  (It looked like the basic version was really bad.)

This is a dressed up abstract with essentially no theme that nevertheless, probably deserves to be in the top 500 at least at BGG for its area control mechanic ambitions. Triple majority area control?  Interesting. 

This is a worthy game to play and even enjoy thinking about manipulating triple majority (three different kinds of pieces)/area controls in little pools on a board.  It seems to be inspired by El Grande, but curiously, fails to even attempt connecting the game to any real world theme.  As such, it lacks elegance and any sense of meaning when played. Hey, it's an abstract!

Giving it a 7 of 10, Jan 2012.  Giving it a 6 of 10, February 2013 because I do not want to play it again.

I've now played the basic version twice and would now insist on playing the advanced version (rating 8). Ensuring that the doubles are distributed evenly among all players would eliminate the huge swing scores. Removing some of the scoring cards (elders & ancestors) would also have a huge positive tactical impact on the game. While the basic game (rating 6.5) is flawed due to randomness it is nonetheless a beautiful, very aesthetically pleasing game that I wouldn't hesitate to play again.

Excellent area control game.  Good mix of strategy and tactics - you must have a long-range plan for setting yourself up for good scoring.  High player interaction as you decide to compete or cooperate in a region, and great fun in the brinksmanship of the cardplay. Theme is silly (who cares?), but the artwork is really nice.  Be sure to play with the advanced rules.

One of the most underrated game around.  Reminiscent of El Grande, but with the ability to modify the outcomes of the scoring rounds with card play.  The card battles sometimes feel pointless, though, and the game can drag if scorpions don't come up.

RATING: 3.5
Rating based on one play at BGG.CON 07.  Oh, the pain, the pain!  Even after a careful reading of the rules and help from passers-by, five experienced gamers couldn't get a coherent game out of this.  We're pretty sure we were doing things right, but the only thing fun about the experience was Scott's impression of a didgeridoo player.  The only way I could be talked into another game would be for somebody to convince me that we had played with incorrect rules.

RATING: 5
Very pretty components does not a good game make. Yikes! Nicely produced by Goldsieber, but the gameplay leaves one wanting. Huge swings in VP scoring. Doesn't seem to have the checks and balances that a well designed game should have.
For area-control, there are many better alternatives to reach for: El Grande, San Marco or Kreta to name a few.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
OK abstract game.  The theme is poor (the game is about conflict, not aboriginal ceremonies) but resulted in some nice artwork.  Some interesting decisions around when to attack for scoring as well as whether to add pieces to the board or bank cards for combat.  The board does not scale well for the number of players.  Five players use the whole board while four use most of it.  With three players conflict is mostly in three or four contested areas, leaving the rest of the board unused.  Restricting the movement of the ancestor (& elder) to 1 (2) spaces results in a lot of back-and-forth movement between the same areas until other players are forces to move their pieces into those areas.  It's fine, but the forced conflict isn't satisfying.  Overall I think it is a decent game, but not one I will play very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good twist on area majority!  The interesting thing here is that you would rather rely on other players to trigger scoring for you, but at the same time not controlling the scoring means hoping that you get in on enough of the other players' scoring to keep up.  So really, it seemed like you had to be a bit fortunate that things went your way.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good, although it outlasted its welcome for me.  I think I'd like it more if it played just a bit quicker.  As is, it's still a good game that I would play if anyone else wanted to, but probably wouldn't suggest over other games in the genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A nice solid influence game which has some (minor) problems with runaway leaders.  There's a surprising degree of depth, but its not as pleasantly subtle as El Grande, and the point distribution fight via ritual cards can be opaque.  Early impressions are that it improves with familiarity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An intriguing take on the area influence genre by Moon, which works in some ways, and fails in others. The nasty factor on this is borderline wicked, the 'ceremony' phases make for an interesting card dominated take on the style, and I like them. The 3 variable types of pieces to put down, each of differing rarity also keep things interesting. However, I dislike a couple of things, firstly, unlike normal AIG the scoring is never 'complete', one region might end up being scored 8 times in a game, while another never is; this makes the total dominance of a given region an incredibly lucrative strategy, as a strong presence in only one area can be a game winning position in this if you can keep causing that area to score. This wouldn't be so much of a problem, but the scoring in this game is also irregular, and basically comes down to luck of the draw, so it feels wrong in some way to me.  Additionally, even without the leader bashing, point-stealing scorpions in effect (we went straight for the advanced rules) the game is still very unpredictable in length, and I have no idea how common this is, but our second game was probably 1/3 as long, (if that!) as our first because a run of scorpions came up early, which made it much too short. I like the idea behind having the game length be variable, but there should be some sort of 'safety valve' to keep the game from ending in *that* short of order. General issue with luck of the draw in this type of influence game as well: luck can hand a player too much at times, particularly if the powerful 'draw 4' or scoring cards keep coming up at the right time. Ultimately, like many "ok" area influence games, this one falls on the bad side of average for me, because the chances that I will suggest it are nil.

Production: Sturdy cards, and nice Ancestor and Elder pawns.  I kept thinking the disc symbol was for a cylinder; the holes through the pieces are inexplicable; and in general the art was way too busy for my tastes.  Play: With three players, this outstayed its welcome, time-wise.  There were interesting decisions along the way, about which shapes to specialize in, and how much emphasis to place on collecting cards, and performing minor scoring.  (2+0+3) (1 play)

Worthy game about acquiring majorities in areas on the gameboard. A deck of cards in each region indicates what action is available in that region on this turn. A bit abstract, however the colourful Australian aboriginal artwork is wonderful. The game play is fine, but I keep thinking I'm playing El Grande on a different board (ie. choose a card, move some pieces around, perhaps score a region).

Played 1 time. Take El Grande, then strip it of all theme and all the different types of action cards. Now reintroduce two types of action cards: shapes and scoring. What you get is an elegant, streamlined influence game. The design is excellent, but I dislike both influence games and abstract games, so this one is one I will be loathe to play again. For those who like the type, I don't see how it can get much better than this.

Wongar is a beautifully illustrated and fascinating game that was probably too weird to catch on.  Its fate was sealed when the production was botched on several levels by Goldsieber!

Botch #1: the theming they chose makes no sense whatsoever.  A game originally about conflict in medieval Japan somehow became an abstract Aboriginal dreamscape involving a guy called the Ancestor and another guy called the Elder as well as Scorpions and Rituals and Ceremonies and most importantly, different shapes of Tjurungas(?!?).

Botch #2: the game shipped with very stupid default rules with the true game exiled to the "advanced" rules.  The standard game is lame, lame, lame.  Why couldn't they call it the "starter rules" or "the rules for third-week embryos and low-functioning fish" or something like that?

Botch #3: apparently "tjurunga" translates as "wooden beads remaindered from our local craft store."  Yes, they even have the holes in them for the string.

But beyond all of these obstacles lies a provocative strategy game in the style of El Grande.  Use the advanced rules, heartily mock the beads, call the honchos Simon and Garfunkel instead of Ancestor and Elder (Garfunkel is the one with the afro), and revel in the bizarre setting and the thematic non sequiturs.  If you're at least 30% insane, you might find that you really enjoy the game.  I know I do.

Played the advanced rules once. I liked it for a while, but ultimately the game began to drag and feel repetitive.

Interesting area control game. 
The conflict/development dilemma works very well (should I put more cubes of my color on the board, draw more card that will help me when a ‘battle’ occurs during scoring, or trigger a scoring to get VP?). But I disliked some random elements (the scorpion cards –although those are acceptable- but also the fact that scoring card may appear at the same time in most of the decks, narrowing the options and making the game more automatic).
Also, the game may be a bit too long. 
The graphic design is beautiful.

hhhhmmmm, I may end up liking this more then first impression.  

First impression is that there isn't much new to the game.  Simple game play.  Pick a card and do it's action.  Arrange for optimal scoring for yourself.  Rinse and Repeat.

But, if I had to pick one genre as my favorite, it would be area majority.  And this one has three of them going on in each area.  So, it might grow on me.

More confrontational than Tigris & Euphrates because you start with your forces intermixed, or at least you had better.

Played the advanced rules with no scorpion stings, no scorpions in the rite deck and non-random initial placement.  The game seemed like a mix of El-Grande with Taj Mahal type card fights.  Not sure why this has such a low average rating - try playing with the advanced rules.

This game is even fun even when you play with the wrong rules (right Mike?).  If most of the scorpions are near the bottom of each deck, the game can play a little long.  But that's OK... it just means more rounds of play... and more chances to screw your neighbour.  My initial rating was a 7... but it's gone up with every play.  It's one of my all-time favourite Alan Moon designs.

RATING: 6
The nice aspect of the game is that it does force some tough decisions about what to score and how to place your pieces. There are two moderate downsides to the game, though. One, the scoring gets a bit erratic. When you initiate scoring, you of course focus on areas where you are strongest, which often leads to one player shooting way ahead of the others. The others usually catch up, but it leads to sort of a jerky feeling regarding the points. Two, the game length is erratic. Since the drawing of randomly shuffled scorpion cards determine when the game will end, the game could go for 40 minutes or could go over 2 hours, strictly depending on the shuffle. A game like this really shouldn't go over an hour.

I want to like this game more.  The theme is odd, and would have been better developed as a war game.  The graphic design is overpowering.

First game of this was a bit hit and miss, I found the whole game unbalanced with no catch-up mechanism. In a 3 player game - 3 novices - the other 2 players became slightly stronger, to avoid direct conflict I became the easier target; if I was to attack I would immediately become weakened and attacked by the other player. Both players were capitalising on maximising 2 areas they had monopolised which was too far away from my monopoly area to move the points markers too. Perhaps 4 player would be better - I do not know, but a game in which you can never catch up from the back, no matter what you do, is not one I can recommend.

I love area-control as a mechanic, but I'm just not that good at it.  Wongar is certainly unique in its approach, and the game is beautiful.  Unless you're getting seriously wronked every turn, there doesn't seem to be an accurate way to forecast a victor.

I've heard the odd thematic presentation turned some people away, but to me it's one of the game's great appeals. The area-majority stuff we've seen before, and as I'm not a big fan of that mechanic it isn't what impresses me about the game. But the wooden pieces and (especially) board & box art are what add to enjoyment of this good game.

This is a fairly abstract area control game where players are drafting which areas they would like to enter into.  The areas are seeded with different cards which allow for scoring rounds and commodity placement.  There are 3 different commodities competing in each area.  The system works well but it's really dry.  I did however like how one could play cards during the scoring phase thus effecting the outcome of the areas ... it sorta provided a war aspect.  However, I don't see why one wouldn't want to just try to collect as many of these cards as possible and save them all for dominination near the end.  Replay value would be low for this one as it's probably 30 minutes too long.

Yeah, it's cool looking, and the Aboriginal theme is neat, if irrelevant.  The big turn-off for me is the huge amount of variability in terms of how long the game can take.  I've seen almost all of the scorpions get buried at the bottoms of the area stacks, and I've seen seven scorpions flipped over in the first two rounds.  Some of the advanced rules are certainly worth using, but at the end of the day, this game is not one that I recommend.

RATING: 6
This reminded me of El Grande mixed with Mammoth Hunters, and I liked it quite a bit. I am concerned that players can get in positions - through no fault or doing of their own - that can have a huge impact on who wins. For instance, I had a spot where I won all three scorings several times. No one could get any pieces in there because of the way things progressed. Yes, I was smart enough to take advantage of this and milk it for all it was worth, but I didn't do anything particularly clever to put myself in that position - it just worked out that way. Further plays will solidify the final rating.

Great looking cards with lots of wood bits.  I like area control, odd scoring and a game that encourages sharing while feuding helps make this game as does the various methods of reaching endgame so there's greater variety.

The game can make for some interesting group-think dynamics - to hoard cards especially. Which can make for a phoney war, each player waiting until the scorpions hit the third scoring table where maximum points from the ceremonies could be achieved before using rite cards. The phoney war can be lengthened by a number of negotiated settlements (we allowed table talk, if you pass, I'll pass, we get to keep our cards and both score) which meant few rite cards were returned.

But the question I had was ... do you allow table talk and negotiated settlements? Our first game seemed much tenser and more enjoyable where it wasn't allowed. The table talk version seemed, well, anti-climactic really, gathering rite cards and going through the motions until the end-game came along. There was little point being the elder as there were no cards to pick up.

The post-game critique centred around the imbalance of value in the area cards (the 'pick 4 rite cards' card being the most favoured) and the chaos factor - its difficult to plan too far ahead as the tjurunga's are continually moving in/out and off/on. It's a meaty 2 hours, but the game hasn't seen the table for a long time now, indicating that the area majority chaos is not that attractive.

Maybe I didn't understand what I was supposed to do.  I liked the design of the game - the aboriginal theme seemed to work well.  I scored half my points with the bonuses for card collecting, and still lost by a lot.  I thought I would enjoy the strategy of getting my pieces in the right places, but the "ceremony" of playing cards to kick out the other players' pieces (or bring in more of your own) made my efforts seem futile when I could start with a majority of something and end up with nothing.

Average area majority game: 3 flavors of cubes (shapes) for control; so 3 winners each time an area evaluated.  lots of randomness & highly tactical;  almost no long-term strategy.  Not a bad game, but there are many better area majority options

RATING: 6
Neat Game. Well produced and pretty to look at. Definately high marks for production quality. The play is intricate and subtle as well. BUt the card mechanism is too random. The scoring can be too difficult to control and there can be runaway leaders in each territory too often. Hence we all found it unbalanced in that respect. The play would get about a 5 or 5.5 from me, but because of the nice production I bumped it to a six.

RATING: 7
Repeat after me - This game should never, ever, EVER be played by the normal rules. They should always, always, ALWAYS be played by the so-called 'advanced' rules.

Now say it a few more times, until you have committed it to memory. 

This is a fine area-control game with unique and interesting mechanics. I could see having a game night consisting of this and Australia. Both are interesting area-control games with Australian themes and both are underrated here on the Geek.

I've certainly played worse games, but not for as long.  I've only played the advanced rules, so I do'nt know what the game would be like with the added randomness, but I don't see how it would help.  Not only does the system feel dry and uninspired but thematically it is devoid of any interest.  The board and bits are beautiful, but that isn't enough to cut it.  There is nothing memorable about how the game plays out.  Hey remember that the famous cylinder battle of '06?  Now I love El Grande and I recognize that we are just moving cubes around sectors, but I get into the theme and appreciate looking at the cubes as caballeros.  Wongar has no theme to speak of.  So essentially it is an abstract game.  

The problem with abstracts is that they have to be compelling systems.  Most of the system feels cludgy and without a theme things drastically stand out.  Wongar tried to create a battle system for an abstract so suddenly you can't help but examine what doesn't work.  Getting cards aids in battles, cards are finite, and battles are worth substantially more at the end, so guess what is going to happen.  Draw, Draw, Draw... And Draw using the point end game bonus system by picking one type hoping to clinch it. The finite system also makes some selections totally worthless.

The majority of the time is spent waiting for the right time to score points.  While you are waiting, most of the game runs tedious.

Difficult to really evaluate, but I think there's a couple of interesting mechanics on an area control game, primarily that there are bonuses to be had if you trigger a scoring, but you lose the opportunity to increase your influence on the board.  I also like how you can move pieces in and out of a region during scoring.  I'm worried that once you establish good control in a region that it's not worth it for others to compete against you.

1 play with 5, 1 with 3:

5er: basic game. Too long, too random.
3er: advanced variant. Better, but still not a great game.
Both: dead last. Maybe I don't like it 'cause I'm so bad at it?

--- Summary ---
The board shows 10 areas where player markers (3 types: cylinder, cube, disc; 4 of each per player) are placed during setup (basic-random, advanced-turn order). Each area has a stack of action cards (random order). At the beginning, a random person has the Ancestor token (brown) and another has the Elder (beige); the corresponding tokens are placed in the 2 central areas of the board. Players also start with 2 ritual cards (advanced game- these are always CHOSEN; also, all scorpion cards are removed from game. In basic game- randomly drawn). Advanced game: remove an Ancestor and an Elder card from all area card stacks; give each player a pair (placed face up in play area) and remove the rest from the game. 

At the start of each round, whoever controls the Ancestor (brown) gets the boomerang = Start Player. Reveal top card of all card stacks on board. If scorpion revealed, advance game timer marker and reveal the next card in the stack. Whoever controls the Elder takes a ritual card. Start player plays first, then clockwise once around.

On your turn you take a card and execute the action -- things like placing new tokens on board, moving Ancestor/Elder, taking ritual cards. Moving the Ancestor and/or Elder to a region --> have a ritual there. Starting with current player and going clockwise until all pass, any player currently (on their turn) with a token in that region either plays a ritual card or passes. Ritual cards move 1 of your matching tokens into the region (from adjacent) or out of the region (to adjacent), or return another player's token to supply. After all have passed, the player with most of each token type scores VP based on time chart in game and the type of scoring (Ancestor/Elder), with ties broken by turn order.

Game ends either when scorpion marker reaches end of track, or any card stack on board is empty. Finish the round. Then, for each type of token, the player with the majority of the single-token-placing-cards (ties broken by Ancestor token clockwise) gets 8VP. Most VP wins.

An interesting area-control game with an odd theme. I can see that it could be a decent game, but it went on too long (after an initial run of scorpions, we didn't see any and the game ended when we ran through one of the card stacks). Also, I just didn't get the game, finishing a distant last! Still it seems like an interesting one - would like to try it with 3 or 4.

(Rating after only one play.) Weird area control game. Lots of chances to screw the other players over. (Which isn't always a good thing.) Not sure how much control you have. I would happily play again.

Interesting area majority game with magnificent bits (beads?). Be sure to play with the advanced version straight out of the box, as the beginner's game has some issues. Wongar is very tactical, where making use of immediate scoring possibilites is at least as important as improving your position on the board. Trading off between short-term gains and long-term ones, it comes as no surprise that Alan Moon is one of the designers.

Neat little area management game.  I'd rather play El Grande, Monkeys on the Moon or Web of Power though.  We played with the advanced rules.  Most importantly, why are the playing pieces beads though?  They never get strung together...

RATING: 6
Enough going on and working well in this game to hold my interest ... but who selected this awful theme and artwork? Update: Played this in 2011 after Wongar languished on the shelf for many years. I had forgotten just how brutally confrontational this game is! It also plays faster than I'd remembered (a good thing). Still hovers between a 6-7 rating for me and remains just barely good enough to stay in my collection (while many other older games are being jettisoned). The art and bits seem to put people off, but if you can get past that, Wongar really remains a solid design nearly a dozen years after being published. 2012 - Going on the trade pile as space on the game shelf dwindles, in large part because, while I like that the game has some real interaction and conflict, I do not like that the winner inevitably is not the person who played best, but rather the person who was picked on least.

Played several games now, and find it has many strategies for victory.  Other players don't see the same level of appeal, maybe ownership of the somewhat rare game flavors my opinion.  It takes a while for new players to get the flow of the game, how starting player changes, and how the ceremonies work with the card driven conflict.  I found out about this game after being introduced to San Marco, and after bringing Andromeda to a number of events.

This game would rate an 8 if I judged it solely on theme and components: it has a wonderfully strange and exotic feel that's quite distinctive among eurogames. However, from a purely gameplay perspective, I think it's merely satisfactory -- it feels a bit too long, and bit samey.

Not sure why this stayed off my RADAR for so long.  Maybe when it was published I was sorting through good versus great Euros.  This one falls in the solid 7 category and is an excellent collaboration between two excellent game designers.  If you like area control games, this is one you'll want to take a second look at.

Convoluted rules, unintelligible gameplay, hideous design.  I couldn't find one thing to like about Wongar, except to make fun of it.  Games that are not intuitive aren't worth my time.  I think this one is especially guilty of trying too hard to stay faithful to the theme at the expense of actually making it enjoyable to play.  Try at your own risk, don't say I didn't warn you.

Based on one 3-player game so far, Wongar has some really cool things going for it.  A "combat" system built into this area-influence game like I've never seen before.  3 different types of pieces all vying for influence.  I can only imagine it would get better with more.  Glad I finally was able to trade for this (thanks, Scott! :))

For a lighter worker-placement game, it is good.  If it had been commercially released closer in time to its original development, undoubtedly it would have seemed much more remarkable.  However, these days there's probably not enough about it that really feels original that's going to make you keep pulling it off the shelf over and over (though it will probably see an okay amount of circulation as part of my "Gateway/Introduction" pile).  

There's a lot to praise about the game, especially EEG's release.  The components are beautiful and sturdy, and I really like the art direction.  There are actually some reasonably interesting choices--e.g., how many of the regular tech-tree-style projects do you build (which give you points and an ability) before you just start focusing on the masterworks (which provide no additional abilities, but more points); when do you lock your master up building the project since he may be unavailable for several rounds (which depends a lot on whether the other masters in the game are similarly locked up--if one person has their master free while other players just have their apprentice available the player with the master can usually make a killing on resource gathering); what order to you deploy the master/apprentice in (which depends a lot on turn order, with it frequently being advantageous to be later in turn order, particularly if you are going to send a master to the market).  This said, there's not a lot of pressure on the types of decisions you make--by the end of the game, if you've played reasonably well, you will have probably had time to complete most of your projects, make most of your respectful visits, and collect a handful of exchange tokens.  The order you do those things in might be different, but the ordering probably isn't going to significantly change the final scores.

It feels like this game would be the type to feel very "samey" after a few plays, but I'll play it at least a few more times to confirm.

Really great production values, but unfortunately a little flat.  I like the timed-worker placement as a mechanic, but it seemed like the better strategies became pretty obvious as the game went along.  I felt like the game was just mechanically funneling towards the conclusion for the last 45 minutes or so, reducing the available choices.

Better-than-average worker placement. I don't like the "skip a bunch of turns" mechanism for sending your master to complete a work. If kind of the crux of your game is "decide whether or not you want to do a lot less for a few turns" I think you should re-examine why people play games. Despite this, most of the other mechanisms were interesting enough to bring this up to a solid "ok+"

First Play: Very high production quality and great art work. The game is quite simple, no great opportunities for aggression as you can happily share locations so no real shut out options.

Play flows well. Just a couple of questions regarding the cards but nothing that held the game up. Nothing new about the mechanics but well put together. I would play again.

Played 2x. I really enjoyed my plays of this game, even though it feels unpolished. The scroll cards felt overpowered. The color swapping tiles made an otherwise simple game way too complicated as you tried to sort out if you had the right tiles to build something. But the timing using the Master worker, the market stalls, the special abilities of the artworks--these all came together well for a very enjoyable game. And the components are over-produced in a good way.

Have been playing the finished prototype for years, waiting for this game to finally see the light of day in a nice published edition.

Zong Shi is not a bad game, but there's nothing particular noteworthy about it either, and at this point in the hobby I'm harder on these types of middling games than I used to be. There are some interesting decisions at first as to how to most efficiently use your master vs apprentice, but once your master starts working on a project and is unavailable for a few turns, your decisions dry up pretty quickly. It's a typical euro efficiency exercise with not a lot of room for clever play here; feels quite outdated for a 2012 release. I now call these middling types of games "collection bloaters" in that they can distract you from playing better games.

Great worker placement with the twist that worker is more powerful than the other.

Zong Shi is beautifully produced with quality components and handsome artwork.  The game works and flows well, with some interesting and challenging choices to be made.  The theme is interesting and fits rather well with the various mechanisms.  It seems well developed with no glaring flaws or inconsistencies.  In short, it is a solid game.

At its heart, Zong Shi is a worker-placement game.  Had it been released six years ago when it was first conceived and developed, it would have been somewhat of a pioneer in the genre.  With such an extensive delay in its publication, however, it now feels rather familiar.  So many games using similar mechanisms have been released in the intervening years that, while playing, I can't shake the feeling that I've done this sort of things dozens of times already.  As a result, the game loses much of its novelty, excitement and freshness. A shame, since the interminable delay was beyond the control of the designer.

That being said, Zong Shi is still enjoyable and challenging.  As mentioned, it is a solid game.  Folks who are not as familiar with the wide variety of games in the genre will likely not have the same reservations or familiar feelings I experience.  Even more experienced gamers may be able to shake that familiar feeling and still derive great pleasure and satisfaction from playing.  It is a fine design … one that I and no doubt the designer wish was released years ago.

Worker placement game with nice components. 

Each round you place your two workers. The "Apprentice" does a standard action at the space, and the "Master" does an improved version of the action. The Master is also the only worker able to build projects--which is what scores most of your points--but he is unavailable for several turns while it is being built.

There are a variety of cards you can acquire (from a draw deck) that allow you to break some of the rules in the game. These are neat as it keeps the game from being too predictable and may help to give you a direction on what you should work on next.

I am surprised by the various negative reviews on this one.  Zong Shi is a beautiful game to behold, both in terms of the visuals, which are extremely attractive without being cartoonish or overly bright, and in terms of the actual materials, as the pieces feel solid and textured in your hand.

It is not the most advanced worker placement game, and it does suffer from a lack of uniform balance among the temple scrolls, but these are minor issues if they're issues at all. If there's any substantive deficiency in the game design it's that the apprentice doesn't actually progress in his apprenticeship over the course of the game.  As it now, the Master does all the heavy lifting, while the apprentice is there so that you as a player don't just sit there like a moron, twiddling your thumbs, while the Master actually works to complete projects.  The apprentice can do a few things, but nothing particularly interesting, nor anything that really decides the game outcome.  I would love to see projects that make the apprentice more able to accomplish these secondary tasks, such that one strategic victory path would be progressing the apprentice instead of the Master's speed or shop or proficiency.  Or even allow for a "mentored" project that gives points toward victory but that doesn't require much Master time. But neither of those things happen, so the apprentice's turns end up feeling a bit anemic or placeholder-ish.  

Still, for me, that doesn't really detract from play.  It doesn't make this a poor or even mediocre game - it's better than that.  Instead think of it as a simplified worker placement/project completion setup and one just has to get used to optimizing what they have.  There are still a variety of paths to victory, and strategies do need to change depending on what other masters/players are able to accomplish.  Some folks will find Zong Shi satisfying in this regard, others won't, I guess.

This is newly published worker placement that feels dated at this stage in the game.  Gryphon did a beautiful job with producing the game and had some great concepts in component storage though!  (IE, the finger slab down the side of the box and insert to be able to get the player boards out easily and the plastic cover over the insert to keep components from moving about.)  Basically, each player has a master and an apprentice.  A Master can do more when taking an action while an apprentice is limited in their ability.  For the most part, I felt like I was playing on autopilot and that my choices were fairly obvious.  I really have no desire to play this one again although the game works and functions just fine...perhaps JASE?

The look of the game and the ease of play seems fantastic!

It does, however, lacks traditional depth of other worker placement games.

Ridiculously overproduced. Almost worth having for that alone. Very appealing gateway attraction. Seems similar in weight and lack of player conflict to Takenoko. 

Very light. Little player interaction unless perhaps 4 are playing. A novel game variant might be 2 players playing 2 colors AND winner determined by the lowest score of the two colors that are being controlled (similar to ingenious scoring).

Zong Shi is a game long in development.  It features worker placement and the use of material to complete projects and goals to further your engine.  It is a fun game, and while it doesn't always agree with me due to personal tastes, I never-the-less do not turn down a game and have requested it on many occasions.  I look forward to a high quality copy of the game so I can introduce other friends to the game.

Also, I tend to lose at it to more skilled players, indicating, at least to me, that the game rewards critical thinking and strategy over luck since the latter rarely rears its unruly head.

First Try:

Easy to learn rules. Nice worker-placement and resource management mechanics. 

One of my friends noted there is lots of randomness in scrolls and material. I agree you don't know what you get with the scrolls, but most of them are quite similar, and balanced so that doesn't really matter. A few are stronger than the rest: the one where you get two materials, the one where the apprentice may start a project and the one wich lets the master start two projects. And with the materials you get to know which are available before you decide which to go for. 

The master projects are quite boringly similar. I'd be more happy with greater variation; +/- 1p and variation in material need. The Kickstarter bonus master project is worth too much though. It gives you 2p/extra material compared to the other projects. A "normal" master project gives 1,33p/material, and the other project gives 0,5-1p/material, but of course also a function. 

Visits give 1p, 2/3p, 4/5p, 1p per material so unless you get the bunuses it's quite expensive, the kickstarter master project gives 12p for the same amount of materials as visiting everyone. Visiting more than one at the same time for an extra cost is never worth it.  Getting exchange tiles is two materials cheaper for 8p, it has the same cost as  a master project which is good. 

I have two fears: 
1. There is too little difference in good and bad play. When we played the winner won with 38p against two players with 37p, 36p and last on 34p. If the difference between a really poor player and someone who does everything right still is only 5p ~ 13% randomness will decide the winner more oftan than skill. 
2. Too little variation in strategy. We all realised that Larger Workshop is very important so most strategis will start with it. There are not very much variation between the projects. 

I'll have to play a few times more to decide if my fears are true, if so my rating will go down slightly, if not it might go up a little. 

2nd try:
Unfortunately the second try confirms my fears. Good and bad play scores so close so chance makes more difference than strategy. This time we scored 34, 33, 31, 31, 31. I'll have to decrease my rating 0.5 points. This game will probably not be played that often.

Interesting worker placement game with a strong and a weak worker. Timing matters a lot as you need to invest your Master (strong worker) for a few turns in order to complete works. The replayability might not be great, maybe more cards should be released or different copies of the same card be available? And then it's basically converting resources to VP, what's not to like!

A quirky worker placement game. I like the idea of of only working with a single master and apprentice. You really have to manage your Master's time well to be a contender. Find yourself sitting on the progress track for too long and you'll easily fall behind.
I'm not totally convinced Zong Shi is a balanced game, mostly because of the random scroll cards. They're all decent, but you'll find yourself digging through the deck for certain cards in particular.
Ovearll: In the end, it's all about the combos you create between your finished project abilities and scroll cards. It's easy to spot a good combo when it happens. Unfortunately, I'm just not sure how much control you have over it. Zong Shi will never be one of my favorites, but I enjoy it enough to keep and probably won't turn down a game.

This is a pretty solid worker placement game, although it would likely have done better if only it could have been published a few years ago! Feels similar to Leonardo da Vinci, but I think I prefer this one. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how often we'll actually play this -- other than the terrific production quality, I'm not sure there's really all that much to distinguish this from all the other worker-placement type games out there now. Still, this is probably one of the more fun ones.

Each player has a master builder and some apprentices. There are several areas on the board, which provide materials, recipes, bonus powers, etc. Apprentices and masters can both go to these areas, but masters generally take more powerful actions. You acquire materials and eventually put your master to work on a project -- which will take the master out of play for up to 4 turns. It's a matter of efficiency and timing: do the best job collecting bonus effects and materials, building stuff that gives you additional powers and victory points, while keeping the master in play as much as possible so that the other players masters don't get too much advantage in the various areas.

I like Zong Shi quite a bit. The game is very balanced and the bits are beautiful. Even so, you need a bit of the Zen master in you to play well, as you will have very little to do on the turns in which your master artisan is tied up on projects. I am a little concerned that drawing cards that cut the time your master spends on projects is pretty much essential to being competitive, but time will tell on this. Meanwhile, it is pretty apparent that the game has nice depth and I look forward to exploring the many paths to success offered here.

I'm not entirely sold on this game. Our play of it resulted in 3 of 4 players having the same score and 2 of four players tying for the win based on how the winner is determined. If this is common, then I think the game is overly balanced. That said, I love how the game plays. There are several options available for players to progress and to gain advantages. Player interaction is minimal, but that's to be expected from a game like this. The mechanics reminded me a lot of Fresco, though players will find this to be a significant departure from that game.

Seemed disjointed, and the temple cards make things a bit too random. Familiar mechanisms.

It's an interesting game where you are really constrained on how many resources you can get/hold.  There are tiles of four colors and you can only hold 6.  You are gathering resources to build projects which tie up your workers for a period of time.  You have two asymmetrical workers, one an apprentice who can only do a weaker action, and a master.  Only the master can do projects, so he'll be tied up more often.  Some projects are cheaper and score less but help you do other things better. The high point projects are costly and require more resources than you can hold without special help.  There are scrolls which are random bonus cards.  There are also a couple of other scoring mechanisms which basically boil down to getting more points the more often you spend tiles on them.  

The sum of the parts added up to a pretty neat game.  It's a solid game with great artwork and an interesting theme.  It's not going to knock any game off your favorites list but it's worth playing.

8 for the game 10 for the componets.  Amazing, parts really, the box and bits,  well done.  

Not sure Why Tom Vasel does not think this game will have good replay value...  This game is not just great to look at, it has easy quick set up time, there are alternative strategies, and some obvious ones, but once everyone goes after exchange tiles there is a lot more here.  Also I can't explain it, but there is some sort of calming effect to the game.  The stress level is there, but it seems to be more relaxed then some other medium to heavy worker placement games.  Go figure... 

Anyway, I have a large collection of games, and I have thought about this game a lot.  Zong Shi will hit the table more often then not, unlike some higher ranked games, (that I agree with the rankings), but just have  too much set up time and are too rule intensive to teach out and play quickly.  Zong Shi could also be a good game to bring light fair players into the worker placement world. 

Anyway, just wanted to throw out my few points here.

Ok worker placement game.  The game is a little long allowing all players to achieve just about everything meaning the game is always going to be very close.  However it also means that it doesn't really matter what order you do things, as you will get around to doing everything.  There is no need to be efficient really.  It also dragged on a bit in the one game we played.

(May 2012) - After 1 5p learning game.  Felt very intuitive to me on the first play.   I like the completed works concept (similar to Leonardo Da Vinci but no race to finish a work).   I went for the exchange tokens (2 colors) to allow me grab any good/tile and make it any other color.  Will play better as players get familiar with the game and it goes quicker.

I've played [b][i]Zong Shi[/i][/b] three times, only in its published state, and my opponents have all been enthusiastic to play again, but I haven't felt that same buzz. The problem, perhaps, is that I'm a hardened and bitter gamer who has played similar games, and [i]Zong Shi[/i] feels like it brings nothing new to the table. If [i]Zong Shi[/i] had been released in the mid-to-late 2000s as Face2Face Games had originally planned to do, maybe the game would have felt like magic. Maybe.

[i]Zong Shi[/i] has a nice concept at its core: Each player takes two actions during a round, with one of those actions being awesome and the other being just a step up from breathing. Putting your apprentice to work usefully given his terrible working habits and poor communication skills is a nice challenge, but the drawback of the design is that much of the time your master is stuck working on projects – which means you have nothing to do but shoo your apprentice this way and that to do pick-up work until the real powerhouse comes online again. The master finishes work, scurries around the village for a turn or two so that residents don't forget him, then hustles back into the shop. Maybe I dislike this game pattern because it reminds me too much of the way I work...

Where [i]Zong Shi[/i] fails for me compared with Uwe Rosenberg's [i]Agricola[/i] or [i]Le Havre[/i], games released roughly the time that [i]Zong Shi[/i] was once scheduled for, is that the game feels much the same turn after turn. Yes, you complete projects that provide a bonus during play – discounts when paying for things, increased warehouse space, less time at the office – but the bonuses are slight compared to what you're already doing to complete projects and visit the townfolk. [i]Agricola[/i] and [i]Le Havre[/i], on the other hand, pump more and more options into the game that your head starts to go a bit woozy as you contemplate everything available to you; an action that seemed ideal on turns one or two becomes something not worth considering. The tension – heck, the entire world created by the game system – seems to grow ever bigger as the game progresses, and you need to scale up your ambitions the same way or fall behind. With [i]Zong Shi[/i], however, you get a temple card here, a resource or two there, an exchange tile around the corner and eventually the game sputters to a halt.

Games are long and tricky but we have so much fun playing it. Once you get it you'll love it!

Has some good ideas, but there just isn't enough variation. I suspect subsequent games will play out much the same as earlier ones, partly because there just aren't that many different areas on the board, and partly because the projects vary in strength. I especially like the project that reduces completion time by one, as well as the extra two inventory squares because mid-late game your master will collect heavily from the market while opponents' masters are finishing projects. I don't care for the market or scroll projects, and especially not the four that reduce future projects cost by one of a resource. (They are too costly and timely to build.)

Having two or three of the exchange tiles is useful, and later in the game you can complete the set with one action using your master. The respectful visits work similarly - best to do a couple early, and let your apprentice finish the remaining right before the game ends.

I don't remember the names, but the cards vary in quality. It's typically better to reduce the master's time spent on a project by one, rather than shave a resource off the cost, because the master can head to the market on his extra turn and acquire 2-3 resources. Also, worker placement with two (2) workers? Come on.

It's like a streamlined version of Leonardo Da Vinci, with awesome components, more player abilities and less choices of actions... so it's lighter and nicer looking with a few bells and whistles, while LDV is heavier, more plain looking and has a few less bells and whistles... I don't know which I like better, but if you could combine the best features of both games, it would be a better game than either...

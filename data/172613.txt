Fun, fair amount of set up and confusing at first, then easier after the first play or two. Love that it uses everything it came with.

I don't know if the timing was wrong or what, but I didn't enjoy this even a little.  I love pirate games, and I was excited for the battle mechanic.  The card play was crappy.

Dice chucker with role selection. Might be slightly complicated but looks fun.

RATING: 7.5
The game is colorful and fun, and has several unique elements for its setting, like the Yin Yang tokens you can use to cast rituals. Even more innovative is the battle system when you play a Captain card, you roll the dice of everyone who wants to go on the raid into the lid, and then there's a proximity face-off between pirate dice and caravan dice which keeps chaining around the board until all ships on one side have been eliminated; very fun. On the downside it does seem like the mechanics feel a bit disparate, not difficult to figure out but not terribly intuitive either. One of many good pirate games I've got that need more table time.

Pretty random game. The fighting is easy and plain randomness. If you can deal with the luck it is actually fast and fun. The phase selection mechanism is a blend of Race for the Galaxy and Glass road, interesting but nothing special. 
Overall the game has some fun aspects, but is far to random for my taste.

2015. dice game. The box lid (tin) is the game board, dice are your pirate ships, and "where they land is as important as what you roll".

Best thing are the ship battles with dice. And a little bit of action selection feeling of good, old Citadels.

Fun game of total randomness that unfortunately is a bit too long. The last half hour or so it drags a bit, but up until then great fun was had by all.

Perhaps give everyone four cards at start to give players more options and shorten the play time?

This was not a very bright idea, for my taste of course, to mix planningfull card-play with absolutely random dice fest.

RATING: N/A
Bought this on impulse as I got a great deal on it and we love pirate games and games in tins. However, on reading the rules and watching gameplay videos I'm not convinced that this would be really good as a 2 player game. Might be interested to play in future though so keeping this in my prev. owned as a reminder...

We enjoyed this pirate game. We enjoyed the role/action selection and the variety of things going on in this game. Definitely one of the better pirate games. It incorporates sea battles (in an interesting way), looting treasure, selling treasure,buying ships, and some curses.

RATING: 8
From the designers of Mysterium.  This is a fun game.  Yes there is dice rolling but the dice rolling is used for fighting.  All the dice are rolled at the same time and those closest to the convoy dice fight it and you compare values and the higher die wins.  This keeps going on until all the player dice(ships) are sunk or all the convoy dice(ships) are sunk.  If the players still have dice around after a battle, then they get booty equal to how many ships they still have floating.  

This game is just fun.  My whole game group likes it and it gets request to play.

RATING: 7
Mechanics make for a fun game, although the random nature of the battle makes scoring a little superfluous. The artwork is excellent. 2 house rules are needed : black spots are only worth -2 at game end, and in battle it is cumulative score for battles fought, not highest wins.

Pirates of the 7 Seas is an enjoyable light game with a pleasant blend of role selection, set collection, and dice rolling. The combat mechanics set this apart and really "make" the game for me. Sure, this game is nothing deep (though there is more than meets the eye), but it fits the right niche for certain groups and occasions.

Ich habe mich das ganze Spiel über betrogen gefühlt. Gefühlt wurde immer von einem Mitspieler die Rolle gespielt, die ich auch gespielt habe und gefühlt immer gingen meine Würfel zuerst drauf auf dem Schlachtfeld. Gefühlt habe ich immer die falschen Waren und Abenteuerkarten gezogen und (diesmal nicht gefühlt) habe ich kein Geld gehabt.
Spiel macht Spaß, dauert aber zu lange. Die letzten zwei Runden waren für mich nur noch die Durststrecke bis ans Ende. Ich hatte keine Chance mehr aufzuholen. Wenigstens ein paar Punkte konnte ich noch machen.
Am meissten macht das Würfel-pfeffern Spaß, was mich an Puzzle Strike (Gegner Schaden geben) erinnert hat.

cool game where the whole game (incl. box) is used. not so much luck based eventhough it has dice (comparable to Stone Age regading the luck factor -> bring more dice and the higher are your chances to get loot). I don't understand why they didn't make this a 5p game :-/

Feels like a Prototype: the Battle system is great but the rest is nothing special at all. Too much rules for this kind of game. The game also takes much longer as it should be. The action cards (Schamane) are too negative and make the game too long at all. This game is a very good example that an editorial department is missing here but necessary to make a good game out of a good prototype.

One of the worst rule books I've ever come across. I don't know why, but this one really bothered me. The game is alright, I guess, but I don't know why you would choose this over Libertalia. The sinking of merchant ships is fun, but I think I'll wait until another game takes this mechanism that is shared with Rattle, Battle, Grab the Loot, and makes it better. Also, the box for this game is just stupid. Really, most of the usability choices for this game are just bad. Because of how convoluted the abilities are, I would have much preferred text on the cards.

I was asking Oleg and Oleksandr for changes, but they were pulling project in a different direction. I wanted upgrades, they wanted role selection. I wanted special powers, they wanted port with prices and set collection of goods. 

This year there will be two pirate games that uses 3d Dice Battle System released. Different games that were born on one common fundament invented by Oleksandr Nevskiy and Oleg Sidorenko. There is mine game called Rattle, Battle, Grab the Loot and there is Pirates of 7th Seas. Both use tossing dice into box. And both take this base idea in a very different direction and game play.

Try them if you have a chance. It's a pure and crazy fun packed into cardboard box.

Seemed to be really long with 2 players. Many curse affects are less useful and harder to apply with only 2 players.

Feels like it would be a much more fun game (and shorter) with 3 or 4 players.

Another dice proximity pirate game.  What are the chances of that (there must be a story behind this- EDIT: There is. Thanks Rahdo)?  They both cleverly use the lid as a dice tray representing the ocean. The dice values represent strength of ships. This is a comparatively lighter game that centers on players selecting from identical sets of role cards each round.  This game is less about combat and having fun upgrading your ship and more about timing decisions of choosing actions based on the needs of your fleet pitted against the cat-and-mouse and anticipation of what your opponents will do.  Arrrr, Curses, foiled again.

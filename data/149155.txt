I often compare it to a pirate themed black jack on steroids with various game-changing abilities. Awesome looking cards and great replay value with the various stones and character cards. A lot of it is luck, but in a party setting there's always lots of laughs and never a dull moment. While still enjoyable with 2 people, I highly recommend to play with 4 people or more! 

It might take some effort to get a hard copy (asking for the files, then submitting to printerstudio.com) but its definitely worth it. The hard copy can be played with more than just 2 people, plus its not too expensive: I ordered my cards during a sale, and the total including shipping was only ~$15! (Normally ~$20)

*UPDATE*

Now Mayday is coming out with their version... Hard to definitively say which version is best, but it seems that the dedicated fans here on BGG have really created something special with this game, and Mayday - while it honestly looks like they are trying there best - can't compare to the version created by the fans, for the fans. I'm still extremely pleased with my version.
I would recommend 'the fan made version.'

The latest version (Captain Carcass) is not a complete game. They promised extra cards from the Kickstarter campaign and did not even bother doing art or prototypes, then waited until after delivery to mention it. They also promised a higher quality linen finish but they also did not want to fulfill that promise either. 

And now they contact me to force me to change my rating because ratings are only supposed to be used for how well the game plays.

This was better than I expected! Quick setup time (might ignore the discard pile setup, that's the only fiddly bit). 1-2 minutes to teach and then your playing. Definitely fills a niche. I'll keep it and play when the time is right (probably when non-gamer friends/family are over).

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Draw cards and decide when to stay. Add those cards to your tableau. At the end of the game, you score the highest of each type of card. However, if you draw a chest and key together, you get to take double the amount of cards drawn from the bust pile... so keep drawing. Draw two of the same type of card in the same turn? [b]You BUST[/b]. You lose all of that turn's progress. Swords let you steal cards from your opponents to play in the center. Cannons send your opponents' cards to the bust pile. Orbs let you see the next card about to be drawn. Mermaids are worht extra points. Krakens force you to draw two more cards. Maps let you search the bust pile for a new card. When the deck runs out, the game is over. High score wins.

It's most amusing to play a sword and steal your opponent's cannon to discard his most valuable mermaid in a single play, all the while having a chest and key in your drawn cards. Boom.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:

This is the best press-your-luck game I've ever played. I'm hard-pressed to imagine a better example of the style.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
This game is very strategic in managing card actions, don't get me wrong, but it's still a celebration of luck. Some games you're just screwed. Draw two cards. Bust. Draw three cards. Bust. Draw two cards. Bust. Meanwhile, your opponent draws all unique cards multiple times and drains the whole bust pile.

This is a simple push-your-luck game with a fun little twist. It did feel like you had choices, and I liked how the different powers of the cards added an extra level of control. I was a little concerned that many of the choices felt obvious, but perhaps when played with more than 2 people it would make those decisions more complex. What surprised me with this game is how conservative I felt with my choices to quit and not push my luck. It seemed like I was rarely being aggressive, and any time I did there was more trepidation than with a traditional push-your-luck game. The added unique elements thrown in by the special powers made the game even better. I'd gladly play this again, but I probably won't rush to get myself a copy.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This game is complete chaos, but for how short it is, it was pretty fun.  It kind of reminds me of design down, though at this point I think I like that one better just because of the deck building aspect.  There are actually some decisions to make since you only score your highest treasure of each type, so when collecting treasure, you getting rid of or stealing opponents treasure, you have to take this into account.  Fun interested to play more as a filler to end a night!

RATING: 7
[Versión Captain Carcass] Un juego casual con bastante azar. La mecánica principal de presionar la suerte se complejiza con los efectos de las cartas. El arte es bastante singular. No he probado todas las variantes, me da la impresión de que no todas están bien balanceadas. Pero es un juego entretenido para partidas cortas y dinámicas.

This little game is a blast! Very quick to play, super easy to learn, and fun little 'press your luck' filler game! I much prefer it to Zombie Dice, since this game has the benefit of player interactions, as well as some strategy to it besides 'roll or not'. Definitely worth the $20 bucks, and looking forward to getting tons of plays in with this one! The only problem I have with this game, if you can call it a problem, is that the discard pile gets shuffled nearly every player turn, so even though the cards are fantastic quality, we ended up sleeving them after only 2 games to preserve them! Not really a problem though.

A nice push your luck type game, seemed like it would be a run-away victory in the beginning but the scores turned out fairly even.  I like the play of people's powers and the suit abilities that made your play style a little different than other people's.  A keeper for me as it plays very quickly.

Well this game certainly took me by surprise.  Jaffet wanted to know if we wanted to play this game based on a card game app... and I just thought feh...  This is the ultimate in push your luck!  It is super simple, and super full of luck, but it is cool to see what happens in each and every game.  I bought it soon after playing it for the first time, and continues to be a firm favourite with family, friends and colleagues!

A quick and easy card game that can be taught in a matter of minutes and played anywhere due to it's small size! I'm not sure how many times I've played it... a crapload. Though conceptually simple, it has a very satisfying card combination mechanic and high replay value due to a ton of character powers and game variants. Also, the theme works wonderfully and has great artwork. Pick it up if you ever see it! It's a great entry level card game!

I had played this game as an app in the past, and was excited to see it implemented as a card game, since it seemed like a natural fit.

The transfer works just great - it's clearly a bit slower with all human players, but it's still pretty easy to learn and very fast to play.

The downside for some folks will be the significant random factor of the card draw. But if you like press your luck games, I would recommend this to you.

I gave this an 8 for what it is.If you like quick and easy games like Uno than I suggest you pick this up. I have never had a game last longer than 10-15 minutes,and you can play it with kids as young as 7. With my kickstarter game it came with a couple of variants and character cards which add a different twist everytime you play it...unlike Uno where you just generally stick to a handful of srategies. Good casual family game.

Solid little game. As others have mentioned. Ditch the traits part of the game (it's cumbersome and uneven) and the base game works beautifully.  There's some strategy, but not a ton -- I'd say the game is 50 percent luck, 20 percent bash the leader/kingmaking, 30 percent strategy. I've seen people losing the the entire game, come back to win on the last two rounds. Really plays best as a 3-4 player game.

Kickstarter Edition:

I like the game better than Incan gold, I see it as a solid replacement for that game. Also, I would recommend to play immediatly with the Mermaid's suit ability. There is no reason the designer/publisher should'nt have included that suit's ability in the rule book. The Mermaid isn't complicated at all, you should definetly include it in your games right off the bat. 

I can't for the life of me imagine playing this game without the mats. one of the actions you will be doing often is stealing cards from players of cards you don't already have. With their being 10 suits for me a quick glance at the mat to see what suit is missing is a sinch. Without the mat it would be too much looking back and forth trying to eliminate what suits I don't own.
 
So, if you don't have the mats, either get em or down load something to place the cards on, because the game would go down to a 4 for me without em. I just think it would be too much of "what suit don't I have?" checking with out a place mat.

Artwork is cool, also I don't see any fun in using the global effects in the game. They make the game too fiddly in my opinion...just put em back in the box. 

I would also recommend using the special power cards in every game. They are well balanced and make the game different enough from game to game. Though, It would of been nice if the cards power was stated on the card itself instead of checking the rulebook.

Played this in a bar at PAX Unplugged in Philly and it is an incredibly fun little abstract card game. I carry this one with me everywhere - the perfect little time killer. Quick to learn, fairly quick to master, really... It just lacks a long-term depth, which feels right. It can't be all that it is and yet be so portable and quick-to-learn yet be super deep. I accept it as it is. Atmosphere seems a little unimportant here, but the artwork is nice. Good stuff.

There were several situations our group had trouble understanding the rules behind, but once we played two or three games it became clearer. Since the rules are fairly simple, I'd like to see them printed directly on the appropriate card.

When they clean up the rulebook and balance the traits, this will be a much better game.

2016-05-09 : A 15-minute push-your-luck filler with a take that element that does exactly what it needs to do : be entertaining for 15 minutes.  Drop dead gorgeous graphics with the only minus that a couple of icons to remind players of every card's power would have helped a bit in the first couple of games.

Surprisingly fun. Bad luck can totally take a player out of a round, but given the short game length it doesn't really bother me, as I often find myself rooting for other players and just want people to draw crazy combos. Totally overpowered trait cards (I mean that in a great way), and interesting round modifiers keep this game from taking itself too seriously. I think I overpaid at $20, but I'm also getting more play out of it than expected.

I tend to preface my rules explanation of this game with "This is an incredibly skillful game, that will only be one by those that can master all the intricacies of this game!" I of course say this with a large pinch of sarcasm, as this is nothing more than a push your luck version of counter snap with player powers... however, it is really fun and a fantastic little party game- I wish it played more players, but with 4 there is very little downtime and games are quick. Player powers and alternate rules cards help add variation.

Push your luck de cartas interesante; con mucho puteo pero también mucho azar: uno sólo controla hasta dónde arriesgar, y a veces hasta arriesgando poco te perjudica mucho.

Egy nagyon jó kis push your luck játék, és mint ilyen persze tele pofátlan mennyiségű szerencsével. Ami viszont ritkább, de itt nagyon jellemző, hogy elég sok kitolási lehetőség is van a játékban. Ez így összességében szörnyen hangzana, de 15 percben ez egy nagyon szórakoztató játék. Hamar unhatóvá válhatna, de erre is gondoltak a készítők és van egy csomó karakter és cél is a dobozban, hogy mindig legyen valami kipróbálnivaló. Kár, hogy nem lehet alapból is 6-8-an játszani, mert szerintem ez egy tipikusan bulizós, ivós partyjáték.

Played at Salt Lake Gaming Con.  It had some elements I like: abstract card games with simple combo-y effects are right up my alley when done right.  See Red7 eg.  This game just didn't grab me enough.  The push-your-luck element wasn't particularly exciting, and the interaction which was actually plentiful still felt somewhat sterile.  There is so much randomness that it feels more like the game is driving I guess.  There aren't that many interesting decision points.  But it was pleasant to play and I would again if someone wanted to.

[Initial impression: 5]
Basically a much more complicated version of Circus Flohcati. I'm not sure how much the extra layering of rules really adds, as it actually takes away some of the "push your luck" tension, as it seems to force more conservative play. As long as you have one or two decent cards showing, why risk getting a Kraken? And the ability to knock off or steal other player's cards with the Cannon or Sword just make the game seem more random. Will play again, but not particularly excited about it.

(02/21/2015) Comment based on one play.

A card game with a push-your-luck element.

On your turn, you draw a card from the deck, one at a time, revealing one of many symbols. You can always "bank" and keep the cards drawn so far, as the object is to collect as many symbols (each with some rank value) as possible. If you draw a duplicate symbol, all cards drawn are trashed and your turn is over. There are some other rules that make it a bit more interesting, but at its core, this is it.

Sheesh. What a stupid game of random crap. It's not too far removed from Incan Gold, but since it is push-your-luck on an individual basis, there's little skill and no bluffing. Once is enough. It's a "3".

Initial Rating: 4.5 (March 2016)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game so the disappointment wasn’t very big. Still I found Dead Man's Draw to be a mediocre game.

The rules can be explained under 2 minutes an the playtime is around 15 minutes (its best feature).

The art is pretty good.

Dead Man's Draw is very similar to Circus Flohcati, a superior game in my book (although not by much).

Nowadays, I don’t enjoy games that have gratuitous “take that” mechanisms and this game has a lot of attack cards. The cannon and sword attack directly and the hook and map can attack indirectly, so it is pure luck if you can attack or get attacked. In general, luck decides too much in this game.

The decisions are obvious, so there is almost no game here.
 
Due to its nature, I think it is best with 2 players, with more it is pure chaos.

I haven’t played with the characters or any variant.

Bottom line, Dead Man's Draw has way too much luck and it is too light for my current tastes. I recognize it can be a good filler game, but my desire to play it again is low. I will sell my copy ASAP. There are better press-your-luck games out there, but that mechanism isn’t among my favorites.

This was a major hit with our game group!  It even drew a crowd when we were playing!  Quick, easy to teach and a... shipload of fun - arg!  

I've played 12 times this weekend and find the best way to teach (played with 10+ - 40+ year olds) was to play the game without any "scenarios" or character trait cards once.  Then play right away with those added in.  We will probably never play without the siren ability for the mermaids, everyone loved it too much.

I Kickstarted this and couldn't be happier with the game play despite a couple minor concerns:  The alternate card is not the same size as the others.  I sleeved the game so it's not that big of a deal, but not with the sleeves they sent because they're too big.

Everyone loves the first player marker which was instead used to sit on top of the discard pile so no one would get confused from where to draw with all the antics (discard pile is face down in this game).

I was surprised by how much depth this card game had.  At it's root, it's simple press-your-luck.  But each suit has an action, each character has a role that gives special powers, and every game has a global rule to follow.  As such, no score is truly safe.  I've seen some swingy moments, but that sort of makes it fun...you're never "out" of it.  But on the other side, you can help insure a victory by having a lot of depth in each suit so you can absorb card loss.  

For the compact size, cheap price, and fun to be had, I'd buy this again.

Push-your-luck with special powers. Neat and effective. Being on the wrong side of a massive key/chest combo in the endgame can stick you with a grumpy face, and cannons can easily reduce to silly tit-for-tat, but it's quite remarkable how most match-ups go down to the wire, sometimes to the very last draw. Seems to reward play that denies your opponent access to powers they can benefit from more than you at any particular moment, e.g. to maximise their trait or rapidly catch-up if way behind. So you're not always just thinking about your own score.

My kids just keep requesting this game. It was an unlikely hit. There's not a ton of depth. It is nothing fancy, and yet, it just works so well. Good for younger children, 6 and up. The fun pirate theme is implemented very well. Done in 10 minutes easily. And there's so many twists and so much excitement.

It's not perfect. I have a few minor gripes: it's a little bit of work to find the 2's and Mermaid 4 before each game; the instructions leave a lot to be desired, the card quality is average, the special abilities are unequally weighted. 

This is my family's favorite filler. We play it at a restaurant waiting for our food. I had to put it in my top 10 games because it just fills its niche so nicely.

I love push your luck games and Dead Man's draw has some pretty cool effects attached to the different card types. Keep drawing card and hope to haul in as much as you can. The scoring system is great, only counting the highest of a type of a card. Good filler.

Elaborated or advanced version of Circus Flohcati? Push your luck and set collection as the core mechanism. Special abilities and variable player powers as the additional features for more tactical play. Still very light: highly luck-driven and short. In all, an enjoyable filler. The artwork is cool too.

Simple push-your-luck game, but doesn't play smoothly enough because of the different kind of special powers to remember (which you don't remember unless you play it regularly) AND in the end the winner is more or less "random" player depending on which player(s) is target in different kind of situations. I mean, Dead Man's Draw is random game with high direct interaction... many of us would say there are a lot of chaos included. So, not my cup of tea. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Dead Man's Draw is a simple and strategic card game of risk and reward for 2 to 4 players. Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.

The core of your turn in Dead Man’s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability. Your turn isn’t over until you say it is, though. You can keep pulling cards as long as you like – until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything. Knowing when to stop and "bank" your cards is the biggest decision you make in Dead Man’s Draw, but being too timid lets braver opponents pass you up with bigger, more profitable turns.

Push your luck? Not really. Push your luck works when there is a "Strategy" behind when to push your luck and when not to. This one is more like "Black jack" except with out a target number. (That's not a great analogy. I'm just saying there's no way to strategize your "Pushing the luck")

Kártyagyáras kiadás.

Igazi push-your-luck játék a jobbik fajtából.

A győzelem nagyrészt a szerencsén múlik, de a játék hangulata, a jól kitalált akciók/karakterek/tulajdonságok miatt egy szinttel magasabban van, mint az átlag "aki mer, az nyer" játékok. Ezt megfejeli még a Kártyagyár egészen szépre sikerült kiadása (kár, hogy doboz nem készült hozzá).

Nem egy agyégetős és el kell tudni fogadni benne, hogy a szerencsén nagyon sok múlik, de ha ezen túllépünk, olykor-olykor egy fillernek megteszi.

I have to say I like it a lot... it's a very quick filler game that plays extremely well... simple to understand but still a game that offers players some choices due to the powers of each of the different suits and as with all Push-Your-Luck games, to know when to stop :p

These kind of games all make me laugh hard... all the misfortune or good fortune that happens are hilarious and it's always fun to react and overreact to each play :)

This is a one-trick pony that seems to get more love than it deserves.  Flip a card and choose whether to risk busting by flipping another.  That's the whole game.  The special powers are enticing, but not so interesting or varied that they actually add any depth to the choices.  No Thanks & Biblios both have more engaging push-your-luck mechanisms than this one.

Dead man´s Draw ist ein wtziges und stimmiges Kartenspiel für Zwischendurch. Wer an der Reihe ist, deckt so viele Karten vom Nachziehstapel auf, wie er möchte. Doch wenn eines der Symbole auf den Karten doppelt gezogen wird, werden alle Karten und somit die Beute des Spielers, abgelegt. Die Symbole auf den einzelnen Karten haben unterschiedliche Effekte: Mal darf man sich die nächste Karte ansehen, mal wird man gewzungen zwei weitere Karten zu spielen und mal darf man eine Karte (Beute) des Gegners ablegen. Für so ein kleines Kartenspiel bietet Dead Man´s Draw erstaunlich viel Interaktion mit den Mitspielern und durch die einzelnen Karteneffekte, kann man sich hier Gegenseitig auch ordentlich die Suppe versalzen. Wer damit Leben kann, der bekommt mit Dead Man´s Draw ein hübsch designtes und flottes Kartenspiel, was man immer wieder gerne für 1-2 Runden auspackt.

Pleasant push-your-luck game, like a mix of Beasty Bar and Incan Gold. Watch out for the badly edited rulebook and mismatched rules precis on the cards, though. Why does it say Mermaids have values of 4 to 9....and then you find a 2 in the deck? Or it says you draw cards for Key/Treasure Chest--hang on, it says HERE that you draw NOT from the draw deck, but from the discard pile. Hang on, if you read the example over HERE, you also have to shuffle the discard pile first.... Sword allows you to steal a card from a player--oh, hang on, not just any card, it's got to be a suit you don't have (what do I do if I have all suits?). Tons of annoying little omissions and contradictions....

Captain Carcass is a simple push your luck card game. You try and draw as many cards as you can without repeating. Add to this card powers, optional player powers and rule variations and you have a good package. Not the deepest game in the world but a quick to learn excellent filler.

It's basically rolling 2d6 and seeing what happens, but unlike most games in the genre (I'm lookin' at you, Munchkin), Dead Man's Draw takes all of five minutes and gives a pleasant *illusion* of control.

An interesting take on press-your-luck.  The cards had good art work.  I liked the scoring of the highest suit cards, which was a good decision point on a player's turn.

The game was a little chaotic with wrecking/stealing cards.  Also with many many suits and special powers, caused a lot of referring back to the rules.  I prefer press-your-luck games to have simpler/cleaner rules.

Push your luck card game. I very much enjoyed my 2p game of this. I would definitely play this again. I am not sure I will own it, but if I can trade for it I might do that. Individual powers and card abilities keep for an interesting card game that plays pretty quickly. Loved it!

Not too bad.  A fast playing push-your-luck card game with variable powers, special characters, and alternate win conditions.  It's actually pretty fun.  Shame about it being only 4 player, because that's a crowded field, but it plays so quickly, there's no reason you couldn't take turns.  Pretty, pretty, pretty good.

9 - Very enjoyable game that sets up, teaches, and plays quickly.  Though initially it seems like there isn't much thinking involved it requires a little strategy while you play to ramp up your score, and greed will always lead you wrong.

PnP and iOS versions (PnP with Aztec Cursed Gold expansion)

RATING: 8
Pros:
* Lots of fun!
* Can use included Trait cards to give weaker players better chances of winning.
* Easy setup
* Portable
* Plays great with 2. I haven't tried it with more.
* No hidden information / no cards in hand
* Box fits sleeved cards
* It's possible to come from behind with huge turns, which makes the PYL aspect that much more fun. You never feel like you're out of the game.

Cons:
* Tends to sprawl on the table so while it's portable, it can't be played in a small space.
* Lots of shuffling. The discard pile gets shuffled every time someone plays a Map card (which is fairly often). It's not clear to me if you should also shuffle for the Key/Chest combo, but we just go ahead and have the inactive player shuffle after any cards are put on the discard pile.
* Tiny bit fiddly. In addition to the frequent shuffling, you need to keep your cards organized and sorted. Fortunately, this can be done while the other player is going (unless he plays a Cannon or Sword). There's a Trait that even requires your opponent pick up all of his cards and shuffle them. I don't think we'll be using that one.
* Mayday really dropped the ball on a few design choices. (1) The Trait cards needed to have names that matched with the hint card. Better yet, they should have had their powers written right on them. (2) One version of the PnP had all suits go from 2 to 9 so you pick any suit to be the "more points but no power" one. This would have been nice to players who wanted a "nice" variant and wanted to remove the Cannon or Sword.
* Mayday had the PnP files taken down. Given that their version is really just one variant of this game, it would have been nice to let people still chose the other options.

Neutral:
* Would be even better if they were chips in a bag instead of cards.

Loving this game so far. As a push-your-luck, you'd expect a lot of luck, but while the choices you get to make still leave your fate out of your control, they're fun choices to make and sometimes you can get some interesting chains. There are quite a few variations to the rules (including from pre-Mayday versions) and the game can survive quite a bit of tweaking. For example, the Mayday rules say when playing a Sword card, if you are able to play a card, you must, even if it causes you to bust. At least one version of the PnP rules states that you may only play a card if it does NOT cause you to bust. The rules state that you may only take a card from your opponent of a suit you don't already have, but nothing is stopping you from lifting that restriction (and we probably will because it's annoying). We've played most of our games without the Trait cards, but they're a lot of fun and can be used to give younger or less experienced players a better chance.

In the push-your-luck genre, I rank the game play right up there with Can't Stop and Claim It but give it an extra point for being more portable and having more variability.

My biggest con is the game depends on the cards being very well shuffled. During play, you tend to bunch up cards of the same suit and if you don't shuffle really well, you'll bust a bit too often. This can be resolved by making multiple draw decks (we use three) and alternating between them. I'd really like to make a chips-in-a-bag version of this game (which would be easier if Mayday hadn't asked for the PnP files to be removed - boo!)

Here's another Push your luck game. the high card of each suit increases your score. Of course, with a Pirate theme, you cannot be sure everything you hold will stay in your possession. be sure to pin down which rules you mean to play under, as the player aids and the rulebooks do not exactly match on some icon effects.

A lot of luck, especially with higher player counts, but I like the push your luck element mixed with the various special abilities of the cards. Lots of good reasons to keep drawing. Pulling off a chest/key combo seems super powerful. The variable player powers are a bit too chaotic and imbalanced, even for a game as swingy as this.

Would rate this higher if it weren't for several quality control / usability issues.

The Good:
Totally interesting game, never quite know how things will play out.  Lots of variety and lots of fun combos to get.  Great card stock quality.  Great artwork.

The Bad:
1) The traits should have been written on the character cards!!!!  This is a SERIOUS ISSUE EVERY GAME I've played.  No one can remember what their ability is let alone how it works because they have to keep referencing a tiny cheat sheet of which there is not enough for everyone.  The space on the cards where the text would easily fit (nearly half of the card) is filled up by an artsy looking symbol for the ability.  This is NOT FUNCTIONAL.
2) I bought an additional pack from the store and the two decks of cards are cut differently.  One set's cards are larger than the other such that shuffling them together is a massive pain in the butt. My first one was bought from Kickstarter and the second the store got by backing the Kickstarter via retail tiers so there should be no reason why the size is not the same. 
3) The suit abilities card required a change of text on it so they included stickers to fix (that's not so bad) however, on this edit, they failed to include that you can only steal a suit you do not have.  Nearly every game we have played this wrong because our players(especially new players) do not realize it from the reference card.

Push your luck card game super fun and easy to play! I have Captain Carcass edition, good cards love the art for it. ( it kinda reminds me of the wild thornberry's) Once Davy Jones locker is set up the games really to go! Each of the players are challenged to push their luck by flipping over cards from the main deck. While using the powers of these cards to either gain or lose all of the cards flipped over by that player. In order to win is to have the highest number of points at the end of the game by adding only the highest value card for each separate suit. This is not including the characters or the missions that can also be included in the game.
I give this game a 10
I love the tin box. The cards are easily organized and they fit perfect in the box. The cards themselves are great. The rules are understandable and easy to follow, and the power list cards are really useful especially when figuring out cards powers during the game.

 This is a fun and light push your luck game. Most often push your luck games are dice based, so I really appreciate that this one is card based and works so well. This also feels like a good "next step game". The special abilities feel daunting at first, but after one play they begin to click, so this is a game that would be an easy transition after gateway games for new gamers. We do not have many games that fit that transitional step so well. My only real complaint with the game are the player abilities. It really feels like some of them are dramatically better than the others. For instance there is one that allows the player to pick a player and get all of the cards from their turn if they busted. In a 2 player game that is flat out broken. We have experimented playing without special abilities, and I think we like the game better that way.

1 play, 2er

It's basically Circus Flohcati but with special powers for each of the suits: flip cards, activating each power as you go. You can stop any time, collecting ALL the cards revealed; unless you flip a duplicate --> discard all cards and end your turn. All collected cards go into your personal display, stacked by suit in descending numerical order. There are a wide variety of powers (e.g., draw 3 random discards and play one of them; play the top card from one of the stacks of another player; reveal the next card in the deck).

The game ends after one pass through the draw deck. Players each get points for the top card in each of their suit stacks; highest sum wins!

There are also several variants: special powers per player; alternate scoring methods and victory conditions (e.g., sum of all cards in suit; first to 50).

A pretty fun game, although also very chaotic -- not sure I'd like it with more than 2 players.

RATING: 5
This is a neat little press-your-luck card game with a special ability mechanic.  Players take turns drawing cards from a deck.  On your turn you can keep drawing cards until you decide to stop and bank what you have drawn that turn or you draw a duplicate card from a suit you've already drawn and you lose everything for that turn.  When the deck runs out each player adds together the total of just the highest card they have banked in each suit and the highest total wins.

What makes this game a little better than most other press-your-luck games are the special abilities.  Each suit is associated with a special ability that you get to activate when that card is drawn on your turn.  This makes the game more interesting than other press-your-luck games, and I like it better than something like Zombie Dice, but it also exacerbates one of the biggest problems in press-your-luck games and that's the luck of the draw.

While it's one thing to just get luckier rolls and score more points than your opponent in a game like Zombie Dice, in this game you are also getting special abilities that can further increase your lead.  One of the special abilities is bad for the current player by forcing you to draw 2 more cards but that's just 1 out of 10 suits and it may not even end up poorly for the current player.  This makes the game doubly more frustrating for the unlucky player than most press-your-luck games and there are simply just better ones out there.

Not a bad filler. Very basic push your luck, but the card powers allow for a few choices along the way.

A friend had sort of a "bash the leader" concern that seems reasonable but I want to play some more to see if it holds true. Usually when you play an attack card you attack the person who appears to be in the lead. This can result in two leaders attacking each other several times. Then, a player in third or fourth place can come in near the end of the game and win.

Sold.

For a long time,  I avoided push your luck games, as I would the six month dental visit.  Apparently,  it must have been the pirate theme that was lacking - as with the recent releases of Port Royal and this title - the genre has come alive in a big way.

Dead Man's Draw is quick, simple, scales well and is extremely addictive. Playing the game vanilla - without traits or alternate scoring - is my much preferred method.  There is more than enough variety in the game itself and in my opinion the traits and alternate scoring are detrimental to the game's balance and they tend to slam the brakes on the quick,  streamlined design - although,  I suppose it is nice to have those options available to you.

Straight up,  this game will hook you in right out of the box,  as it begs to be played repeatedly.  The design here is nearly flawless and I recommend Dead Man's Draw for groups of any kind.

A quick game that is simple to learn and challenging to master.  I love how careful play can lead to a great chain of actions.  This game is accessible to pretty much anyone.

Check out the iOS app if you need help understanding how some of the cards work.

A nice little filler game with a good combination of "take that" and press your luck.  The re-themed Captain Carcass artwork is a significant upgrade, but not worth replacing the original.

[thing=149155][/thing] is a push your luck game, in which players are trying to accumulate cards from different types since, in the end, each player will score the highest value card of each type - thus is valid to have more than one card of a type, since attacks can take away cards, and having more than one in a type means that losing one will just lower your score (for instance, if you have a Mermaid 7 and a 4, you would score 7 points; if you lose the Mermaid 7, you would still score 4 points).

Now, it isn't the amount of luck in [thing=149155][/thing] that bothers me, as there are plenty of push your luck games that I enjoy. What irks me is that is possible to lose several turns and the direct attacks - these three together can truly make a mess of a game, usually a recipe for failure. [thing=156009][/thing] has two of these things (luck and losing turns), but the lack of direct attacks make it much more tolerable. What saves [thing=149155][/thing] from the dread territory is the smart decision of making it short - lasting for around 20 minutes, the agressions and highs and lows of luck bother a lot less, and the lightness of the gameplay even allows for some entertainment and enjoyment to be had.

Overall, [thing=149155][/thing] isn't a game I will recommend, being one I'm just OK with, as it offers some simple decisions and is quick, doesn't causing much in terms of emotions for me, for good or bad.

Light but fiendishly evil 2 plyr push-your-luck card game. Has faced some criticism for being a little unbalanced - but for goodness sake - it's a 2-plyr light and fun card game, not Terra Mystica. Get over it - it's great fun even when you're losing badly.

simple push your luck game.  I don't know why but I can't really enjoy playing this... something is always missing when I play it. 
You just pick up cards from the deck and lay them next to each other in a row. For each card you lay, you can use it's effect (steal a card from another player, take one from the discard pile, peek at the next cards to come etc.) 
As soon as you lay down a card that is already in the row, you lose all the cards. When you stop before this happens, you can put them in front of you. Every "suit" is numbered (I think 9 is the highest respective number). You always put the higher card on top of the lower of the same suit and in the end scoring, the one with the highest score wins.
To me this is no good game

Plays well as a 2 person game. First run though took a few rounds to get the hang of it. We played without the trait cards, as suggested. After 2 games, we could see where we could add the trait cards back in and have a slightly more in depth game. But its fun to play without them also for something a little lighter. This will stay near the top of the pile to play again. Also one we want to introduce to our church gaming group. We purchased a play mat for this game, and also printed one off from someplace (maybe BGG, sorry I forget). They were handy in keeping organized, but not necessary.

Fun and simple 'push your luck' game, that is very very easy to teach to new gamers - even with the special 'divers cards' and 'score cards'. I think it is equally fun to play either with or without the special cards - but normally I play without them, just to enjoy the game in its most basic form.

Nice wee bit of push your luck filler. I have recommended this one a few times and am happy to play it more. I like what it achieves as a push your luck but it would be better if it could have been streamlined a little more. It is simple but for it's weight I feel it could have been simpler.

Excellent filler - taught in two minutes to people who are not particularly into board games. They immediately requested another round. It might get boring after a while but we did not play with Variants or Traits, which I suspect adds additional life.

What a nifty little filler! At first it seems too simplistic to be interesting for a seasoned gamer, but once you play a few hands and see the different card effects interact it becomes a tense and exciting romp. It's almost a perfect blend of push-your-luck plays and clever combo chaining. It's also interesting to see a tablet app get a cardboard conversion, instead of the other way around!

This is a push-your-luck game at it's best. Fast, easy to learn, addictive and flavored with a nice twist. The different trait abilities and your unique character assures you a huge amount of replayability! I'm hooked. I admit some characters seem to be way overpowered ... but still, I'm hooked.

We've only played it a few times. Twice with 2 players, once with 4 players. It's a fast game, lasting only about 15 minutes per round. Lots of fun, great mechanics with the card actions and point system, and INCREDIBLE replayability with the Traits and Variants cards (which we haven't used yet). If you had one game to take on a trip, this would be it, since you can play lots of different ways with the same deck.

This is actually a huge hit in my gaming group in-between games or at the end of a gaming night when we're all tired. The more tired we are the funnier it gets. So it's our go-to filler game! It's incredibly easy to learn so you can just play it with everyone. And you don't mind that it's chaotic because it's over so fast.

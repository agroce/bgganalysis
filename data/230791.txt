Coolest game I've seen at Gencon. - amazing minis and gameplay. Rating is based on TWO play through sessions I've participated in, the quality, the look, and the value. This could go up or down, but I know it will be in the 8 and above rating.

My pick for Game of the Show at Gencon 2017.  I got a chance to demo the Werewolf scenario.  It was fun and perhaps would be better a second time around after understanding the rules better.  I am looking forward to battle scenarios.  If the game does not pan out, the models will be used in Warmaster Medieval.

And to state the obvious, the miniatures and terrain models are amazing.  They chose a great scale for conveying an epic feel.  

Kickstarted (only my 4th in 5 years after Sentinels of the Multiverse, A Study in Emerald & Digital Twilight Struggle).

Have to wait until I play it to rate, but from the "Let's Play's" I've watched I'd be surprised if this game disappoints. So many interesting game modes. 
War gaming, made more accessible, without sacrificing strategy. 
I'm particularly excited about Leo's design for the playable hidden murderer in the 'Ars Nova' expansion.
The price for the game, with all of the expansions, is $540 not factoring in shipping, unreachable for a lot of people. So I do hope this game becomes so popular enough that the expansions will be available for a decent price at retail down the road.

Nice blend of history and (supernatural) legends, lots of scenario's, playtime of 90 minutes, different gamemodes (vs, coop, solo), awsome minis, low complexity yet lots of strategy and siegewarfare. And a gigantic dragon...

Sounds too good to be true. Hope it lives up to the hype and my expectations...

Played a demo in Essen and read the rules. Seems like a very flexible system.

I guess one (demo) game doesn't give me loads of insight of what the game is capable of or is going to be transformed into, but alas. The demo I played (SPIEL) was between me and a friend of mine. The scenario made him the defender and me the attacker.
The game grands a lot of options without making the game very complex, meaning that there should be enough possibilities for tactics and strategy... if the dice allow it, that is.
As the game does seem to depend a lot on random elements (events, dice roles, resources per turn). My opponent didn't seem to hit anything, I seemed to be hitting everything... and in my second turn, I has already won :|... So yeah, I keep it on 7 for now. The game seemed fun, but the game was on the short side :o.

Typical KS campaign: offer hundreds of minis and backers will pledge like crazy. Right from the start so many expansions available with little information.  Questions not answered by creators. More quantity means not more quality (in gameplay).  The minis are 15mm scale, so Joan of Arc will vanish between your fingertips, all of those great marketing videos hide this successfully.   It‘s impossible that this game lives up to the hype.

My 4 year old could not believe his eyes when he saw the kickstarter trailer and the siege expansion photos. He cannot wait to play with this. I am a bit more hesitant, I am not really a war gamer, but the short playing time is very attractive. I guess I will get the siege expansion and maybe the dragon, let's see what else is coming...

This is an amazing game produced by an amazing company, Mythic Games. Innovative area activation mechanic, exceptionally detailed 15mm scale minis contrasted with giant demons and monsters create an epic and immersive tabletop experience I have not seen before. So much thought and care has gone into every detail of this game. Whether you choose to play one of the prescribed scenarios or create your own armies and fight giant epic battles, or even join with friends to eliminate the mighty dragon, you will find this medieval tabletop euro style war game an absolute blast.

Withdrew from Kickstarter. Due to the business decision to go all in. That is 540$. Maybe geek friendly, but not family budget friendly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Preordered, but honestly think this is a game you should wait for a second edition on (if one ever exists). The miniatures are great: the idea of a hex-based 16mm-scale game with buildings and huge monsters is something a huge number of people can and should get behind. 

However, the battle mechanics are incredibly simplistic and the gameplay's success or failure will hinge on how much fun the various (basically unrevealed) scenarios are from a story-telling perspective. I like dice a lot, but I like them when coupled to a more strategic game (say the movement system in X-Wing Miniatures). 

Ironically, this game reminds me of Mythic Battles: Pantheon in that the strategy layer is very thin and can be "learned" within a few plays. Both this game and MBP have drafting or list-building components to help cover up the lack of strategy in skirmish gameplay, but they would both be untenable in tournament play in my opinion. I personally only think these two games are and will be playable in scenario-mode.

Pre-ordered. Rating based on a single game and available content. 

It is a a fast (45-90 min) point allowance war game with historic, holy and/or mythic (16mm) miniatures fighting in thematic scenarios or open battles in a modular board with 3D sceneries. 

UPDATED ON 22/1/18:
The game takes many elements my wife and I love in other games. However there are currently not enough options (e.g. types of scenarios) for the holy faction my wife is mostly interested in. I hope additional scenarios will be released by Mythic Games or fans allowing us to play the game more frequently and for many years,

RATING: 8
I may revise it later, but for now, after watching several vídeos, and based on the production quality of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, which is a previous product from the same publisher, I rate it at a 10. The game is very well designed. Its mechanics don't get in the way. The miniatures look absolutely gorgeous. The terrain is amazing. Mythic Games delivers very immersive games with interesting decisions. These games are not just eye candy.

It's definitely more a game system than an actual board game. The system is indeed very interesting, and introduces a new way of playing.

The scenarios themselves may or may not be interesting, based on the player's areas. If this could be expanded into many different scenarios, or that can be fan made, that will make this game system so much better.

RATING: N/A
I'll abstain from rating the game until I've played it, however the Kickstarter campaign deserves a 10. Not only does the team respond to comments and questions almost round the clock (and runs live video events every other day) but they also regularly take backer feedback and suggestions into account.

For instance, they added an extra single-player/coop scenario to the Dragon expansion that was initially only planned with vs. scenarios after some backers indicated they only play games solo.

Conversely, the add-on with the monks had a solo/coop scenario, the investigation into a murder in an abbey (losely related to the Name of the Rose movie with Sean Connery), but the backers requested a playable murderer that could thwart the investigation and a vs. scenario was subsequently added to the add-on, at no cost.

The team also threw away 2 weeks of design and sculpting work on the 180mm Beast 'miniature' because the backers weren't enthused by it, and they're working on a new design based on the user feedback (and it was a free Stretch Goal to start with, so with Mythic Games you *can* look a gift horse in the mouth).

Finally, it's worth stating that each stretch goal miniature will be part of at least one scenario, in addition to providing additional/alternate stats cards to diversify the Battle Mode.

This company make great games, Joan of Arc will be a mixture of rpg and miniture game on one hand and on the other hand it can provide a great plattform for very very big historical battles in the year 1400 (the 100 years war).

This game is a genius one.
It knows how to do almost everything - starting from a solid activaton system, JoA offers little investigations scenarios up to massive battles.. and dont forget to let you play every stories you can imagine in a medieval-fantastic (but classical) world.

A word about the scale of the minis : it's 15mm, twice time less than standard mini-games. So the game respects the scale between huge creatures (giants ..) and simple humans. This also allow to have visually satisfying buildings and castle elements.

In one word, Joan of Arc is a complete game.

Playtest during a french convention.
OK, stuff is good, miniatures are perfects and all the background is amazing.

But game mechanism is confusing (actions cubes for this, action cube for that...) and the fighting system is the same as Descent : colored dices with various stats. Roll. Shields cancel Swords. That's all. That's OK for Descent, not here.

And the end : too much random for a tactical game, too much apparent possibilities for a very linear game.

There's also good ideas : the respawn system is fun (but dice rolling again), the buildings management is pretty smart and gives some opportunity to create mini-dungeons inside the main board and, the stories are good. 

But after the play test, i think this game should be far better with another fighting system, like Savage Worlds for example.

I like the "group decision" aspect of this, with the player paying the most influence getting to decide. The bluffing aspect is also interesting as well through the less than overt attempts to get people what you want them to do without actually telling them is an interesting part of this. Nicely done... more time on the table is required though.

Heavily disliked by my gaming group, due to the random lightning cards. Would probably have to remove several just to be allowed to bring the game back to the table; but would it be more fun then? Any fun? Unknown. 6 fits. I would trade it, but I have beautiful artwork drawn on the inside cover.

+ Completely unique; The end-game scoring criteria give you a different viewpoint to play through each new game.
- Lots of the game takes place outside of your control which can be frustrating at times.


Why it's previously-owned:
You can spend multiple turns not doing anything worthwhile; worse yet, you can spend multiple turns watching the rest of the group choosing to do things that screw you over without any purpose of screwing you over.  Not my favorite experience.
This got traded away as part of a huge online trade.

Beautifull family game. Awesome miniatures. Great, funny artwork. The game flows well with no downtime. Each player has cards with treasures which are in specific locations on the board so he has to win the bidding in order to select where the team will go next. (Playerds move together as a team). The game is quite random but I think casual gamers will like it.

RATING: 5
For the last five turns i had nothing to do, as all my objectives had been completed, mostly by other players. The rest of the game i just made shure that nobody else could get any more points. 

This was probably rare, but it just enhances my feeling that faidutti does ok games that miss the final polish.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting game design with some intriguing bidding and "group movement" mechanics. I liked it, though did not love it.  It felt a bit chaotic in play in our four player game.  Yet, I could sense some interesting potential with the game.

On the downside, the lightning bolt cards felt annoyingly random in their occurrence and ability to swing things in the game.  I am not a huge fan of randomly drawn cards that allow you to steal cards from other players.   

I think the graphics on the board, including the hard to contrast place names, really fail the game, detracting from the enjoyment and tractability of the play. Would like to try the game again to get a better idea of the game.

Made the mistake of trying this game with some hardcore strategy gamers.  Needless to say, they were far from impressed.  I do like what the game tries to accomplish, but too often a player seems to be in a position where no meaningful decisions are made and they just 'go with the flow'.  Also several cards that radically shift the balance in favor of the owning player.  Should be a decent family game though.

{2 plays • 3-player and 5-player} While I'm sure people will call this one ELFENLAND with Bidding (Bruno even put Alan Moon's name on the box, though maybe he also contributed more than just "inspiration," I don't know), it's really more like WILDLIFE ADVENTURE/EXPEDITION with Bidding.  But what's also there that I like - and this took me a while to realize - is this I'M THE BOSS feeling that the game also has.

No, there's NO negotiating, but you're constantly building a hand of cards, and then, each turn, you *maybe* use them to get what you want.  With luck, you don't use them, hoping that someone else wants to go where you want to go.  But you can also help that to happen by block-bidding (which costs you no cards), or by playing a "take that" card.  Both of these can result in someone else winning the bid and spending their cards.  Even better, someone else wins, gets you *close* to what you want... and then you can use a "take that" card to alter the move, usually horking the expedition leader in the process.

My first game was the 3-player game, which maybe helped me like this one, as with a lot of games that play 3-X, the 3-player game just has more control/less chaos.  But then I played the 5-player (that same day, even!), and once you get past the "take that" cards (again, these feel more "fair" in the 3-player game), it was still good, but in a different way.

In the 3-player game, you have to "work" more to achieve your goals, which can be satisfying.  But in the 5 (and I assume 6)-player game, you can luck into - or strategically create - more situations where someone else does your "work" for you - which is also very satisfying.

And in case I've made the game sound kinda "mean," it really isn't - there are actually not that many "take that" cards in the deck.  But in the 5-6 player game, you go through the deck faster, so these cards will come out.

The Destiny deck might be a hiccup (these are endgame scoring goals, like the Prestige cards in Princes of Florence).  Everyone only get one for the whole game, and it might be the case that drawing a really bad one or a really great one might be too swingy... but maybe not.  It's a large deck of cards and I've only played twice.  But the fact that there's an "action" card you can draw during the game that let's you draw a new Destiny card and swap it out for your old one makes me wonder if that card was in the mix from the beginning.

This game is definitely not for players who might get frustrated easily, or feel picked on - heh, the 5-player game totally pushed my buttons a few times, bringing out the whining Dave - but once I got over that, I really enjoyed the "puzzle" here.

Caveat Emptor: there is an "action" card you can draw that lets you steal a Treasure card from another player.  As you only start the game with two Treasure cards, you then only get 3 more over the course of the 16-turned game, they are, essentially the main way you score points, and you might not even "deliver" them all... I really hated this card, especially when it came up early in the game... several times.  I could totally see how this card could just ruin this game for someone.  FWIW, we just reshuffled it into the deck the first few times it came up.

I was surprised that I enjoyed this as much as I did, especially with the bidding mechanism.  It's fairly light, and the pieces and art are pretty great.  There's a lot of luck in the cards you get (treasures, cursed treasures, and movement cards), but it's still pretty fun.

Szerintem ez egy alulértékelt játék! A TTR-hez hasonló mechanizmusú játékok közül talán eddig ez jött be legjobban. Sokkal jobban tetszett, mint az Elfenland. Pedig a játék alapmotorja elég hasonló, de itt a kártyás licit feldobja, és teljesen más irányt ad neki. Ha nagyon akarom, akkor a sokféle kártya ellenére is elmegy családinak, mert nagyon jó az ikonozás. Egy parti alatt minden kártya megtanulható. Ennek ellenére azt mondom, nem minden családban fog működni. Egyrészt a szabály időben többszöröse a TTR-ének, másrészt elég erősen konfliktusos. Tehát én csak gémerekkel játszanám, de hát ízlések és pofonok. Annak ellenére nagyon pozitív a véleményem, hogy egyetlen liciten elbuktam a potenciális pontjaim 2/3-át... A játék 5 fővel is csak 80 percig tartott, könnyed, színes, szórakoztató. Ja és igényes a kivitel is...

RATING: 4.5
Isla Dorada is a bland quasi-family game: it is light enough to be played with non-gamers, but has some little rules twists that are somehow hard to explain to not-so-involved in gaming people...

Once started, the flow of play is very straightforward, and the game is short enough (with 4 players, at least) to be a semi-enjoyable ride even for hardcore gamers. It is a "ride" because it is very chaotic, and the victory would be probably decided by chance more than strategic play.

The mechanics are not so new and original, but this is implied by mr. Faidutti by crediting the previous designers on the box cover, so it's fair enough...

In the end, I have also a minor complaint about the "readability" of the cards: while the whole graphic project is quite high quality, the art and fonts on the cards makes them very difficult to tell apart.

Hmmm, what do I think about this game? I'm mixed. 

The game is basically just bidding to get a figure to move to a location that suits you best to hit certain objectives. I was a little underwhelmed with the game play, but I think that is because I was expecting a deeper game. 

We played a 5 player game in about 45 minutes. I don't know why the box suggests a longer playtime. If it was longer, I don't think I would like it as much as I do. 

This is a fairly light game that could even be used as a gateway game. The components are gorgeous. 

So, expect a light game that you should play at a good pace to keep it moving along. Not your typical FF offering.

Wonderful bidding game that is easy to grasp and fun to play.  It is not a deep experience, but I have a wonderful gaming experience every time I play this one.  All people I have played it with have liked it too.  

It is lighter, but I have played it with many gamers who have very much enjoyed the game.  I believe that the "take that" component of the game in forcing others to travel to denstinations where they do not want to go is really enjoyable by all levels of players.  However, players who enjoy no spike in thier games may not like this one.  For me, spite is one aspect of gaming that can tie different levels of gamers together, allowing the reluctant nongamer and the cult gamer to enjoy the same gaming experience.  Isla Dorada has great levels of spite, is easily learned, and is generally enjoyed by all.  I highly recommend this game.    

The look of the game is great.  I may like the look of it over any other game I have played.

Played twice with the kids at the kiddie game group I run for ages 8-12. It took most of the participants a while to wrap their head around this one, perhaps because of all the different card types. After a few rounds, when everyone had the rules down, fun times were had. Still, cute and easy as Isla Dorada may be, I hesitate to call it a gateway game. 
Looking forward to playing with an older and wiser crowd. Definitely has potential.

Good family game but be mindful that children should be able to read or be prepared to assist them with minor text.

Very unpleasant game.
Contains random 'take that' elements that are just malicious without reason.
Controlling movement of the expedition party is very random and frustrating.
Card values are all over the place and do not seem to reward good play.
Winner mostly went with the flow (had a destiny card of 'collect GONOGOs' which [b]he could control during the game[/b]).
Pieces (serpent/bigfoot) are overproduced.
I gave it a 2.01 because it's not as bad as "Pony Express" - but only by about 'that much'.

A game where you get sweaty palms have to be good.
It is often very agonizing when you don't have the right cards to win the bidding, and see the expedition wander of in the wrong dirction.

The trash talk is ongoing from the first move through the entire game.

I thought the gameplay here was unique and fun, but my game group disagreed. They hated the tug of war with leading the expedition, but I thought it was really clever. Sometimes you had to ride out the mayhem until the right moment to make things happen the way you'd like. It was a fun kind of chaos.

Played first game 01/14/2011, with 5 players. Seemed to be more heavily dependent on luck than I thought it would be reading the reviews. Will have to have multiple playthroughs to see if there really is a strategy beyond some of the obvious ones.

Edit 4/25 Have played a couple more times and enjoying it more. Still not as much strategy as I would like, but there is a little more there than I initially thought.

Very fun, very interactive negotiation game with set collection and an interesting auction mechanic. Definitely play with the alternate bidding rules: it's much more fun to join bids with your competitors, forming temporary alliances while you pursue your personal goals.

The artwork and components are great, the names of the cities and cards are just silly enough to be entertaining without being offensive (unlike so many other "island" games). Far better than Elfenland, IMO. I don't understand why this isn't more popular than it is. 

UPDATE Jan 2016: Now I understand why this isn't more popular than it is. It's very easy to get stuck for turn after turn getting nothing you want, and the game drags on miserably when that happens. It's ultimately too luck-based for a game of this length.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

The amount of luck in this game is a bit too high for my taste for an hour-length game. Each move for the explorer feels super important (which is good) but what really irked me is card selection.

This game re-uses the Ticket to Ride card selection system to its determent. The worst feeling in Isla Dorada is looking at a spread of cards that are of no use to you. Ticket to Ride can get away with this because:
(a) It's a shorter game.
(b) It's less directly competitive (if I'm bidding against someone, I really want more control.)
(c) You can lay down trains anywhere on the map, so you don't get that "None of these even connect to this area, I can't use any next turn." feeling.

Ontop of that, there are a number of smaller design choices that bother me:
-Textless cards. The symbols in this game are particularly esoteric, and the colors of sand vs. mountain on the map vs. the cards isn't immediately clear.
-There's a card that lets you steal a treasure card from another player. Since you get NEW treasures so rarely this feels overly harsh. It might feel more fair if treasures and curses had the same back and the player had a chance of getting cursed instead.
-The first time you play, just finding areas on the map is a slow process. The color-coordinated names are a good start but not enough. Why not a mini-map TtR style on the treasure cards?

The game gets some props for having some of the best figures ever though!

RATING: 6
Let's start this rating with an 8. There's a lot that I like about this game. I'm a fan of auction games in general, and the idea of "one pawn shared by everyone" leads to some serious reasons to bid up. The production quality is very good. And, like many "family" games that I enjoy, the ruleset is fairly straightforward. Bid on a path, move the pawn, play treasure/curse cards, and draw new cards. The only complexity comes into the game via the wide range of card types and oddball effects.

I really liked it, but I can see where some might feel this is too random. This is open, though, to scaling and customization, either by taking out the cards that introduce too much chaos for some, and by introducing the shared bidding. Right now, this is easily my favorite Faidutti design and I hope to get some more play with this game.

Update: 2nd play, and again I like what this game offers. A four player game went over better than six players, as the bidding felt like it offered players a bit more control instead of frustation. If we try it with six again, it might be best to attempt the "cooperative bidding" rules instead.

Update: played this again with six, this time with the cooperative bidding. At that count, cooperative bidding is a definite improvement. You're never totally out of the planning, and there's a nice bluff element that emerges if you can get away with other players unwittingly doing your bidding. It's also an intriguing play to hop in late into the bidding war and tip the balance against the wishes of others. For 5 or 6 players, cooperative bidding is the way to go.

Update: after watching this one sit on the shelf for too long, I ultimately traded it away. It's not a bad game... it just has a few flaws that prevented me from getting too excited. I love the idea of everyone controlling one pawn, but the sheer diversity of cards made it a bit too difficult for casual gamers, and hardcore gamers bristled at the chaos factor.

This game has a great playful theme, and is very well produced.

However, the take-that nature of some of the cards and the way card-drafting works....players will frequently be put in a position where they MUST play a 'mean card'.  There are some players who just don't want to be in that position during a game, and it can become uncomfortable unless you're in a group where that type of play is a given.  As a light family game, that is frequently NOT the case.

Even so, I think the game is very good...but it tends to last much longer than it seems it should. If we could get it played in about 60-80 minutes I'd rate it higher. But our games have been closer to 2.5 hours, which is just too long for a game with this much chaos.

The combined-move mechanic, established by auction, makes this a unique game in my collection. The advanced rules take the auction a step further with cooperative / allied bidding which is a great twist.  With just a couple of plays thus far, this has been an enjoyable and fairly easy-to-learn game for the family.  There should be a lot of replay value just based on the sheer number of destiny (end game goal) cards.

Played first time with 6 players.  Having that many makes it a bit long for what it is.  Game is probably too mean for anyone other than hardened gamers too.  Reminds me a lot of Santiago with the collaborative bidding rules.  I'd give it another shot (with 4) but don't think many in my circle of friends will be asking for it.

Amazing production value. 
I love the concept of bidding for where the expedition will go next, but the game seems very random and I felt like I had very little control, even in the game where I won more than my share of auctions.
Before I played this, it was the top game on my want list. Now it's an optional game for me.

I don't like this game as much. My wife likes it.

We now play with a house rule so that a player can pay 1 gold coin to pick up a new mission in lieu of picking up new cards. We also play the Shared Bids variant. 

One complaint is that it's hard to find the places you want to be (or avoid). English versions of the places would be nice (e.g. Crystal Falls).

Potential variants: Pick up double adventure cards? Pass 3 and pick 2 Destiny Cards?

The core mechanics to Isla Dorada is a bidding game which moves all of the players to a city on an island.  Each player has a different set of locations the want to get to, and some locations that they do not want to go to.  I like the core game a lot.  Added on top of this simple concept are a lot of special cards, making the game a little too difficult for most holiday gatherings.  :-(  Many of the cards are "take that" cards, prompting people to mean to other players, which is something I don't like in a simple family game.  All of the special cards also add quite a lot of chaos, which is another thing I'm not a fan of (except perhaps in simple kid games - which this could have been, but is not).

So I'm torn on how to rate this game.  I would give an 8 to the core game, but a probably a 5 or 6 to the current implementation.  I've considered removing the special cards to see how the game plays, but I have not yet done this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Players have crashed their Zeppelin on an island, and must navigate their way around as a party.  Players play auction turns, bidding travel cards to influence the party's direction around the island.  You're trying to steer the party to your secret treasure locations (positive victory points), and avoid your cursed locations (negative victory points).  The game is played over approximately 15 turns, and points totalled to get the winner.  Nice looking game that plays easily enough - that's the good stuff!  The bad stuff will take a bit longer ... the game is way too long - this should be a 45 minute romp, not a 90 minute game.  The game is too random (okay, Faduitti, so we knew that going in) - you can spend several turns trying to get the party to your location, only to have your cards stolen from you, etc.  The game is graphically hideous to play the game.  I was eighteen inches from the board, and I couldn't read the town names or card titles - go look at Elfenland and Elfenroads to see how game graphics are done properly.  A blend of Wildlife Adventure/Expedition and a reverse engineered Elfenroads/Elfenland, with half the quality.

RATING: 8
My first play with 4 people was a blast!  We played with the co-operative bidding variant since everyone seemed to think it sounded cooler, and we had a great time.  There were many funny and/or frustrating moments (depending on who was on the receiving end!), so this game is better for a group who enjoys a certain amount of "take that!".  The artwork is gorgeous and the graphic design is very functional and effective.  I did poorly in my first game but I am very eager to play it again.  In fact I can't wait!

I'll provide more detailed comments after further plays, but my initial reaction is that this could be one of Bruno Faidutti's best games!

Update: The only issue that bothers me in this game is 2 of the power cards that allow the player who chooses them to penalize 2 of the other players (Samedi and Panda).  In the early game, this seems to unfairly penalize people randomly, in the late game, it comes off as an obvious catchup mechanic that doesn't feel fun.  We decided by consensus to play without these 2 cards in our last game.

All of the players are fighting to move an archaeological expedition around the map in a way that suits their hidden agendas, with no regard for what it does to anyone else's agendas.  Fun game with great components and surprisingly tense bidding wars.

Really fun and exciting game.. But only the first time you play it. All players move as one group of explorers around the island looking for treasure, but each player has a different goal so in order to decide where to move, players must bid and the highest bid wins. It is possible to team up with other players or ruin other players plans by special cards.
Overall it's a nice party game, not too much challenging and largely dependent on luck.

RATING: 7.5
Igazából persze nem tudom, h 7-8-9 az értéke. Ha azt nézem, h az Elfenlandnak 7-t adtam anno...És hát ugye le sem tagadhatja az Elfenland őst -nem is akarja: szerzői közt ott van Moon-.  Az alapelv hasonló: bejárni a helyeket, optimalizálni az útvonalat. Ugyanakkor mivel itt nem kell minden helyre eljutni -sőt nem is akarsz, a negatív lap, az átok miatt- így persze a szimplám optimalizájuk az útvonalunkat helyett, licitálós -melyik irányba menjünk-, próbájuk elkerülni helyeket, és persze mivel nem mindenkinek kell minden helyre eljutni, komoly érdek ellentétek vannak/lehetnek, ha nem is épp mindenki közt, de bárki közt. Ugyanakkor érdekazonosságok is fenn állhatnak, ezért érdemes nem az alap licitálást használni, hanem a játékszabály végén leírtat, mert ott azonos irányba menő játékosok összefoghatnak. illetve amivel még másabb az elfenlandnál, h vannak a másik játékost "piszkáló" kártyák is, amivel interaktívabbá válik a játék.
Update: közben bár újabbat nem játszottam vele, de összeálltak az érzések: 7.5. Nem jobb, mint az Elfenland - más. Szebb is. De alapvetően ez egy igazi családi játék, semmivel nem több, egy kvázi ki nevet a végén szintű játék, és most ez nem ledegradálás akar lenni, hanem pozitív mondat.

Played with six, which may be above the game's optimal number of players. Isla Dorada plays like a more complicated version of Wildlife Adventure. Usually, I find complications of mechanics to be pointless, but I did enjoy the complications of this game at least a little bit. Overall, I found the game to be a well done Faidutti game. A pretty good theme, fairly simple mechanics, and some take that. Isla Dorada is a good game, no doubt, but not my type of game. If you are reading this to decide whether this game is for you or not I would not necessarily consider this a negative or neutral comment. The design is solid. The game simply does not mesh with my preferences. 

We played with the group bidding variant, which I would highly recommend.

Rating after one play (five players) and is a very personal rating.  This came across as a family game to fill in an evening and at that level it probably works well, although for me I would personally steer people towards games like Cartagena / Uptown / Settlers.  Felt very luck heavy - card draws, treasure draws, bonus victory point draws.  I felt that my ability to bid was affected too much by the random card draw and with five players my ability to influence the game was limited.  Some misunderstanding on the end of game scoring chits and a couple of rules not explained very well.  I have a feeling that this is substance (nice graphics, nice bits) over form.

The components are very good.  A large colourful gameboard and cards, though the cards are maybe a little thin.  The plastic models are great though probably overproduced as they don't influence the game greatly in my opinion.

Gameplay is frustrating as there doesn't feel to be much control, especially if others are conspiring to move the exploration in the opposite direction.

I like Faidutti games and there's nothing wrong with a bit of random chance, it's just a bit over the top in this one.

Bidding phase is fun, but a bit too predictable. Adventure cards are grossly imbalanced. These complaints don't amount to much, because the game is sooo light. I do recommend playind with advanced bidding rules though.

Sajnos ez a játék sokkal többnek mutatja magát annál, amennyi igazából. Kb. 0 stratégia vagy taktika van benne, csak a jó húzásáról szól a játék, mivel a kártyák egyáltalán nincsenek kiegyensúlyozva. Akinek az orra előtt jó kártyák jönnek föl, illetve aki szerencsés kincseket húz, azt semmivel se lehet megverni.
Nem baj, ha egy játék a mázliról szól, de én úgy éreztem, hogy ez a játék több ennél. Sajnos nem....

With all the card collecting and bidding that is going on Isla Dorada is masquerading as a deeper version of Elfenland while it is actually quite a bit shallower. There already is a huge amount of luck in drawing the treasures, curses, and adventure cards, but the effects of the entirely unnecessary but inevitable (this is a Faidutti game, after all) take-that cards are a great way to tear even the last remaining meaningful decisions to shreds.

I have rarely seen a light game that goes to such lengths to add layer upon meaningless layer of gameplay elements. Too arbitrary for gamers, too confrontational and fiddly for families.

"You are standing in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike." At least the grue looks great...

So far I have only played two four player games, so my opinion may change significantly later on.
The game is well balanced but one has to be aware that it has a significant amount of luck. This is not an actual problem as Isla Dorada is on the lighter side and during my plays nobody took it too seriously. The artwork is incredible and fits the mood of the game perfectly. I found the gameplay very similar to Ticket to Ride, both in mechanics and depth. Although I find the idea of everybody moving only one piece quite innovative.
Altogether I think that this is definitely one of the more enjoyable light-weight games. I would probably prefer it to Ticket to Ride because of the higher interaction between players. (Nevertheless I like my games meatier, so I wouldn't play it too often.)

Meh, I didn't care for this game much at all. You travel together as a team and yet play competively against each other, to some strange named places on the board, that are difficult to find at a glance. Then there's all these different cards. also with weird names, that you're constantly looking up on the cheat sheet. Instead of just listing what the damn card does, on the card itself. You have to look it up on this sheet, that's not even alphabetized. So you painfully scramble over it, with all the funky names.

Basically you bid against each other. Trying to get to places that you need to go, in order to score points. You win the bid. You go there. If you have a card for that location. You score it. You have a curse card for that location. You lose points. Bah! Just not my type of game.

"Be like water" is the best attitude in a game of Isla Dorada,. Don't expect to get what you want, so why should the others get what they want? :) Seize opportunities and screw the others when possible. If somebody wants to get to someplace very badly, it probably isn't in your best interest.

I liked it, but it *really* seemed to bog down with six players.  Maybe better with more like four?  My biggest annoyance was that it's one of those games where you occasionally are required to be a jerk to other players for no real benefit to yourself.  I don't find those mechanics amusing.  Other than that, it seemed like an interesting Elfenlands-like transit game with some clever bidding.

More chaos from Faidutti.
I like a few Faidutti's games like Citadels, Castles or La vallée des mammouth, unpretentious and solid.  Obviously he evolved far away from that.  I can understand the philosophy that games should be primarly "fun", and I like the occasional mindless romp of a game, but his later designs just simply lead to nowhere; this is the archetypal new Faidutti, full of "I do better, more fun games" crap and nothing else.
I wonder how many games he will still be able to get published based on name recognition alone.

RATING: 6.5
After 2 plays with different groups, this game is kind of weird...

I mean, there are so many different cards with different effects, which make it "hard" to learn, but on the other hand it is very luck driven. At the same time you have the "Ticket to Ride"-card market, so you can choose an open card instead of just draw blindly, and you have the ten coins to buy cards you really want... I don't know, this game is hard for me to say if it is any good or not...

BUT, it is a good production when it comes to components and artwork!

RATING: 7
(02/2012) This is a light, fast, family-friendly game that feels like Elfenland, with an auction mechanism. A single exploration party races around an island, trying to visit various sites connected by paths. It feels like a semi-cooperative game, where players bid to choose where the exploration party moves to, then anyone who has location cards in their hand may expose them to claim victory points. Since there may be overlapping hidden incentives (each player has their own set of objectives), there may be temporary secret collaborations between several players. The thinking could go like: "Oh, you want to go in the same direction as me? Well, then, I'll pass and make you pay for the bid." 

The components are top-notch for FFG, with over-sized miniatures, thick cardboard counters, and decent card decks. However, there are plenty of specialized cards that need to be understood (they feel like action cards from TI3, for example), with plenty of "take that" elements in the cards. Understanding and applying how these elements work together will take a game or two.

As a group of heavy-weight gamers, it became quickly apparent to us that there seems to be too much randomness, and very little control over it. Because auctions are driven by what movement cards you happen to pick up, and since there are the "take that" cards, there seems to be too much chaos for our tastes, more so than what is in Elfenland. We all agreed that this game would be perfect if we were much, much younger, like in our teens. Because it is very accessible, this may be perfect for non-gamers as well. It may require a game or two to see the strategy and tactics involved underneath. We're all willing to try again. Initial rating is a '7'.

Ehhez képest 35 pontot értem el, és még a legjobban küzdők is csak alig pár ponttal értek el többet. Vagyis kis szerencsével, akár úgy is meg lehet nyerni a játékot, hogy nem csinálunk semmit. Márpedig ez nem játék. Egyébként is rendkívül drága, azaz a játék ár-érték aránya: egyes.

This is a family type of the game where final scores don't mean anything and spending time together over the board is the most important part.

In my opinion, this game is a hidden gem!  The unique (at least to me) mechanism of bidding for control of the one movement piece creates a new level of interaction in the gameplay.  The artwork is top notch and colorful (although I wish the 3 pieces were painted) and the island theme is excellent.  It may seem a little complicated to learn all of the different cards, but the recap sheet is helpful.  When I start to explain the game to new players, I can see some of them get a little overwhelmed with the different cards.  But I encourage them to play a game and they have consistently thanked me for helping them through to the actual game, since the game is much easier to play once started.  Last time I checked, it is no longer printed, so grab a copy if you find one (for less than $40 or so)!  Enjoy!

One play was enough for me.

Gorgeous art work, a game almost there (I would think good for older children) but I so hate the "take that" cards (stealing cards from people or making them discard cards that are slow to collect anyway).

Overall I got that my decisions had very little influence on the game result, and that was on the few times I had enough of the right card to influence which route and direction we took.

This game looks awesome - the artwork is slick.  The city names are ridiculous, which is either GOOD or DUMB...  Because there's a lot of pre-game explanation, this is good for gamers - but LOOKS like it should be for beginning gamers.  I don't want to play it all the time, but it's fairly unique in my collection and comes out occasionally when I have 1.5 hours and a willing group that straddles the fun/more-serious line.

One of the best screw your neighbor games ever.  The real beauty is you don't really know you're doing it, and they can't reveal it until the end of the game lest they ruin their chance of returning to the spot they were aiming for.  The end game conversations are incredibly fun.

RATING: 6.5
In the category: less serious but beautiful overproduced games this is a winner. I think that even with clever play, a player won't necessarily win. There is simply too much randomness in this game. Also be forewarned that the games comes with a hefty dose of 'take that'. If you don't like that, don't play this. Game is also a bit lengthy for what it is, game wise. But all in all, moving the adventurers around the Island keeps the tension going and makes for a pleasantly light experience on a beautiful board.

This is definitely a hidden gem, in my opinion one of the most under-rated games of 2010. Must-try for any Faidutti fan, I would say it ranks up there with his best. It doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, which is best described by Mr. Faidutti himself: "It’s not a sophisticated management or development game, it’s just a dynamic, fun, varied and highly interactive movement game." (For anyone interested, on Faidutti.com there is a lot of nice background info - this game has been 10-years-in-the-making!). The most fun and fresh aspect to me was the "group" movement: we all bid on where the explorers as a group go next.

This is a FunForge/FFG game, but the production quality is on par with a typical Days of Wonder game (high praise indeed), same kind of "light family game" feel to it too. Gorgeous art, which has a kind of European-style cartoony quality to it. If the gaming gods are at all just, this one should get at least an SdJ nomination this year...

RATING: 7
Wonderful gateway game. Not without its flaws (a little too long, power cards can be a little too complicated) but I just don't care. This is part of my 1-2 go-to for non-gamers if I want to convert them. Start with Ticket to Ride to get them interested and get the familiar with some of the systems the two games share (set collection of currency, destination cards, etc) and then move on once everyone's comfortable to Isla Dorada for more complexity, more going on above the table, and so much more interesting interaction. I love this game. Also--oh my god the pretty!

After all the negative comments and from reading the rules I wasn't expecting much from Isla Dorada. Still, I had a small hope that I might enjoy it as Elfenland is one of my favourite games. Hence, I bought this when it was sold off cheap at Spiel 2012. I wasn't disappointed as our first game was great fun. It certainly is not for hardcore eurogamers and benefits from casual play but in the right group the game gets wings. Sure, there's direct screwage, there's huge luck of the draw but there's enough satisfaction to be gained from calmly piggybacking your way to your destinations as well as pushing through your bids. Our play was with four players which seems like the perfect player number. With more, chaos might overtake.

An unusual game. Despite it looking really easy in the rules, this game is much meatier than it lets on. Players try to move the expedition to where they want it to go by bidding with cards.

A light game, although the rules are a little bit fiddly. However, when players get used to the game, it plays quickly and is fun. Some aspects of the game have Ticket to Ride feel. The most interesting part of Isla Dorada is leading the group according to your needs. All the players walk together, however not everyone wishes to go to the same place.

Nesudėtingas žaidimas, nors iš taisyklių taip ir neatrodo. Kai įpranti, žaidžiamas smagiai ir greitai. Matosi tam tikra Ticket to Ride įtaka. Įdomiausia šio žaidimo elementas - vesti grupę ten, kur tau reikia. Visi žaidėjai vaikšto kartu, nors ne visi nori ten pat eiti.

Take Elfenland, add better looks, some chaos and luck, some take that and switch from strategy to tactics and you'll find yourself playing Isla Dorada. I don't like Elfenland, it's a big piece of meaningless downtime and other problems. But in Elfenland you're at least doing it all by yourself while on Isla Dorada you'll have to carry a bunch of amateurish Indiana-Jones-wannabes with you.

Auction game with secret objectives.
It's fun, until you get stuck doing nothing from turn to turn getting curses and getting away from your objectives.
This gets worse as you have little control to what happens to you.
Too much variance: to get points, you must turn in treasure cards and you have 5 during the game (2 at the start, 1 before middle game and another 2 before the end); but there's some cards (antik) that give you one more treasure at random points in the game.
Your opponent got 2 antik and you got nothing? Bad luck!
Someone got a card that steals a treasure from you? Bad luck!

It would be passable if it was much shorter

Nice game - fun to play socially.  Works well with 6 players.  Really reminds me of Das Amulett, but I think it is better.  The names are crazy, I seem to enjoy murdering them and renaming them.

This is never going to be a favorite, but I think this game does succeed at what it aims to do.  I;ve played twice in short order and had fun both times - but the game is more of an event, and amusement ride than any real sort of strategy game.  Consequently I expect the novelty factor to wear off pretty quickly.

Not bad, but too many different cards (including one that makes the cards be mixed again) make the game too chaotic for my taste. They can create rather unfortunate situations where some of the players are just wandering aimlessly for some rounds. Otherwise it would be fun, but this way there's something definitely missing... I think I missed the 'arc' of the game. Being able to get&buy only 1 cards in a round when there are 21 different types causes that rather often you just cannot get any interesting cards while other times you see only good ones. I appreciate Mr. Faidutti's aims to create a really fun game and in some ways it clearly succeeds but in order to make it fun it should be fun for each players during the whole time - and when there are 30 minutes where you just can't do anything remotely interesting it is not fun.
(and it's NOT an Andrea Angiolino-Bruno Faidutti-Alan R. Moon-Pier Giorgio Paglia game as far as I know: it's a Faidutti game that uses the ideas of Elfenland (Moon) and Ulysses (Angiolino-Paglia) to create something new.)

It is a decent gateway or introductory game for new gamers.  After only one play, victory seems more or less dependent upon how well you have synergy on drawing matching destiny cards with treasure cards.  There's a bit of a "Take That!" offensive card play now and again.  Maybe I'm wrong but that's just my two cents.  I feel like I'd rather play Elfen- something or other...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I expected and wanted to hate this game but was pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend playing the advanced game right away it is a better experience - particularly with group think even though the auction rules are a bit screwy.

LIKES:

* Auction using terrain cards to travel paths.  The advanced game would make this even more interesting as people could pair up to make sure the totem goes down the desired path.  
* Reminds me a bit of Elfenland except that the whole group goes along the same route so you fight over what route to take.  Sometimes, the route you must take will cause you flip a curse card for negative points.
* I like the initial big end game goals as well that offer opportunity to score 20 points in many cases.  This is something that is hidden and people may or may not know.
* I like the different type of action cards that are made available as well that you can draft instead of terrain cards.  Forces you to give up potential increase of your bid for special actions.
* There is some decision making in the game as well in that each round you have a chance to spend a gold coin to select a second card from the display.  However, each gold coin is a point at the end of the game so you have to decide if giving up a point is worth it.
* The group think/conflict involved with the advanced rules are more interesting and makes for a more balanced game.  The airship is far less overpowering in the advanced game.

DISLIKES:

* Game can take a bit longer than desired as you rinse and repeat for 16 or more turns.  I need to emphasize that this game needs to move BRISKLY or it gets old fast.
* The action cards are not all created equal.  Some feel overpowered.  I'm not certain it came out that way in my one play though.
* If you don't like games where you pick on the perceived leader, AVOID this game.  It WILL happen.  It HAS to happen to keep the leader in check.
* Stupid minis are much larger than they need to be...and the city names are smaller than they should be...
* Advanced rules make for a better game BUT the game doesn't come adequately prepared to deal with the odd bidding rules.

RATING: 4
4/10 It is a real sadness to me as if you go to the designers website you can see the amount of development and playtesting the game went through (http://www.faidutti.com/index.php?Module=mesjeux&id=669&fichier=582).  Its just the end product didn't match my tastes.  I hope his next game will.

Detailed comments;

The plastic bigfoot piece, which dominates the board when used and has an anchor round its neck, is a good metaphor for the game: bloated, unecessarily weighed down and cumbersome.

I have no problem with the overall spirit of the game.  The do nasty things to others is not a problem to our established competitive nature of our group if the game is quick and we rarely take games overly seriously.  However, often in this game your choices are in order of likelihood (1) do something obviously nasty before it is done onto you, (2) do nothing then finally (3) do something intelligent and considered.  Not a great hierarchy of choices; do something intelligent should never in any game be after do nothing.

Furthermore, the doing nothing is often due to the fact that you have no power to impact play or move the focus of the game towards your preferred locations on your turn.  Downtime is not a problem in this game but being a distance from the centre of action is frustrating.

Secondly, my test when you play games with expensive pieces is would the game be any worse if you just replaced them with basic tokens?  In this case the answer is definitely no, it might even be improved with basic markers.

Thirdly, I think the game is harmed by a weak attempt to appeal to some imagined mass market.  What do the masses like?  Producer says big plastic pieces.  Lots of plastic pieces then?  No just three.  We live in a real world and I want boardgame companies to succeed but in this case it seems a misplaced strategy.  These oversized pieces really feel ornamental rather than functional.

In summary; he game as it stands is negative, unitentionally squeezes some players out of the game and finally is over-produced which pushes the price of the game up and consequently the expectation and demands of the game which it cannot fulfill.

At the most basic level I would like to see a reductionist version stripped of its theme and over-production.  A greater number of cards which you can do positive things with (e.g. influencing the bidding for routes) and a way that the bigfoot etc can be used not just for blocking.

As I love fondling gorgeous bits, a game with artwork as nice as Isla Dorada was sure to grab my attention. Sadly, FFG in their infinite wisdom get everything printed in China, and right out of the box I had a warped board. These things are fixable, but I'd prefer not to go through the hassle in the first place.

On to the game - it's good. Maybe not great, but I'm still exploring. There are a bunch of cards (almost half) that offer special abilities, but they don't seem popular when we play, and so the tableau gets clogged and we all end up drawing random cards. It's also difficult to get a good enough mix of cards to win even two bids in a row, so you can feel rather helpless. Despite this, the game is enjoyed whenever we play, and it honestly feels as though with time, some winning strategies will reveal themselves.

[i]Isla Dorada[/i] and [i]Bohnanza[/i] should be played back-to-back following consumption of vast quantities of alcohol.  

The bidding mechanic makes this an enjoyable game.  The main thing I don't like is that treasure cards can be drawn and immediately played if its city has been previously visited.  This seems to increase the luck factor quite a bit, similar to drawing new routes late in the game in [i]Ticket to Ride[/i].

If I could add one thing, though, I would like the cards to have text. It's a bit annoying to have to have a cheat sheet for cards.

More an experience than a game. Big SCREW YOU factor. Could be fun with the right group. You won't make friends playing this however.

RATING: 4.5
Game in a Nutshell:  Vote using cards to move a token representing the whole group around a map. Try to reach the areas that secretly earn you treasures while avoiding the ones which are cursed.

Played as:  3,4

Pros:  Awesome production values.  The nice colorful art is only outdone by the three beautiful, enormous minis that scream "Paint me!" The core of the game is a fun twist on a bidding game and presents a new experience in a "family" game.  Each player having their own secret goals (and curses) makes for an interesting push and pull around the map.

Cons:  I really can’t think of one part of this game that is intuitive. There are far too many niggly little rules.  The main driver of that are the loads of (too many?) special cards which try to get by on completely useless iconography. So useless, in fact, that each player needs a giant text-filled player aid; however, even the player aid doesn’t cover all the little exceptions for every card.  It really sets the foundation for an experience that never flows and causes the game to outstay its welcome. Luck of the draw can be a back-breaker with a few cards that are exceptionally overpowered. 

Other:  You can sense that they were going for a "Ticket to Ride"-esque family style game.  I wonder if they couldn’t have achieved that had they trimmed some of the fat (starting with those special cards which are excessively advantageous).  That or just scale it down with a smaller board or less rounds to keep it shorter. The "advanced" bidding rules (allowing you to combine bids with others) are definitely the way to go right out of the gate since they don’t add much in complexity while making for a much more interactive experience.

Best Use:  A serviceable family game I suppose.

RATING: 6
When you see all the round markers out you'll think the game is going to last hours, especially when you look at all the steps of a round in the rulebook. In actual fact the rounds fly by quickly. 

It's not bad. There's a lot of chaos and a fair bit of take-that. The artwork is pretty, but the map doesn't have the same charm of the Elfenlands map that it is based on.

The (german) rules are not very precise. so there is beside the luck a lot of space for discussions. Well its an ELFENLAND variant with typical Bruno Chaos . And even for my taste there is a lot of take that and kingmaking included. Great figures and artwork but bad card quality, no scoring track (could increase kingmaking) and the unsatisfying gaming experience  will save myself from buying this even if its cheap

A game of rope pulling and parasitizing. Sometimes you want to go to the same direction as the last bidder, but you make a higher bid for an other direction just to make him pay more. Awesome and evil.

The pictures are gorgeous, but there's no other illustration level to expect from Naiade. That guy is a genius. Also, nice gaming pieces.
The game... more like meh. HEAVILY random for how long it takes. The auctions are just too little deciding agony, because you might even return to the auctioning AFTER you passed. If someone could take the same principle, but squeeze it under 30 minutes, this would make for a great game.

Artwork gets an A - colorful and stylish. I like the idea of hunting for treasure on a tropical island. The concept of all players moving a single piece is cool and one that I haven't seen. I also like the idea of each player having a unique goal and a cursed location they want to avoid.

With all of that positive stuff, something still falls a bit flat. Not bad, but not great. I'd really like to try it out with 6 players as my two games have only been with three.

Played: 3 times.

Update: Ended trading.

Great, light 'take that' game where the players have to outbid each other to lead the expedition down different paths as they seek to visit villages with hidden treasures, whilst avoiding other villages where they know curses exist. 

This game is one of the best looking games from an artistic perspective, that I have ever seen and played. 

Great game but shines best at the 4-6 player count.

This game wasn't even on my radar until I picked it up during a sale. I was interested when I saw the sale price, but was so much more pleased with the purchase after an initial play. This is a very unique, simple, and fun game to play. It has a Ticket To Ride vibe with everyone trying to influence where an explorer visits on an island. This makes sense with Alan Moon as one of the co-designers of the game. The rules and game flow are simple and satisfying. It has elements of other games, but it is unlike anything I have ever played. I think anyone that enjoys Ticket To Ride will enjoy this game. The components are also beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Really boring family style game. Combines the Ticket to Ride-like route-building of games from Alan Moon with the randomness of a Bruno Faidutti game. The end result isn't sure what it wants to be. There's some bidding to travel down different routes, and a few things peppered in to make you want to go some places but not others. The whole thing just feels kind of half-baked and bland.

Can someone tell me what the relevance of a game like ID is in 2010?! I mean there is nothing remotely new here or different or exciting to say the least. The game is basically Elfenland made worse (longer and more complicated). This is why the minis had to be so ridiculously oversized because otherwise the game would lose its only "appealing" aspect.

All in all, another proof of the dead staleness of the eurogame genre nowadays.

A game where your scoring is largely outside your control. Which you either accept in order to enjoy the game process ... or be bored or frustrated by. Each turn, everyone bids on what nearby city we're going to explore next. You have no idea what points any other player is going to score by going to any particular city, whether they're bidding up just to get a step closer to the other side of the board say, or whether other players are passing because they don't care or because they simply don't have the bidding power (cards, of which you get one a turn) to get to where they desperately want to go. So turns are a series of gradual point revelations. We go to a city, players reveal any points (+ve or -ve) which they have in their hand relating to that city. Repeat with another bid, 16 or so times. The bidding process is fast, mainly because players either don't care (having no points cards for nearby cities) or don't have the bid power to influence multiple bids (being forced to save bid power for when they really care). All of which makes for a lot of turns where you don't care or can't influence events - which can make for a fairly average time. At the end of the game everyone reveals their secret quest card which may have been ridiculously easy and worth bumper game-winning points, or obstinately hard to achieve and not worth much to boot given how events transpired. It moves along at a decent pace. I just wish there was more control-meat on the bones.

Just plain fun to play.  I particularly enjoy bidding to move the expedition, variation of the adventure cards, the great components, satisfying "take that" cards, choices whether to fulfill destiny/go for treasure/keep certain cards like bonuses in hand or not.  The game is easy to explain and the artwork is top-notch.  Easily game of the year for me.

This game didn't have to be so fiddly! I'm sure there was better ways to implement the treasure cards, curse cards and destiny cards into a more "compact" mechanic.
 
Another problem i have with it, is that there's a lot of cool cards with all sorts of effects, but not enough copies of them, so you see them like one or twice per game.

All that said, the game is very entertaining and fun to play, and after you get past the "fiddlines" the experience gets a lot better! Especially at those times where everyone is near their curse cards!

Elfenland utánérzés. Hasonló, hogy itt is sok város van, amit fel kell keresni, igaz itt nem saját bábukkal kell végig menni, hanem egy közös bábuval. Mindenki, a kezdőjátékostól kezdve felül tudja licitálni az előző játékost, hogy merre menjen tovább a bábu. Ami viszont lényeges különbség a nagy elődhöz képest, hogy ebben vannak küldetéskártyák, átokkártyák és kincskártyák.
Összességében jobban tetszett, mint az Elfenland, de itt viszont csúnyán be lehet ragadni, ha nincs olyan kártyája amivel módosítani lehetne az útvonalat.

Isla Dorada is a "marooned on an island, explore for treasure" themed game for 3-6 players. Players bid resources - pack animals of different types - to explore jungle, mountain, sand, water pathways in their quest for treasure. Destiny cards that are kept hidden from other players can serve as point boosters if objectives on that card are met. Other cards add little twists to the overall game flow.

Isla Dorada is better played with the full complement of 5-6 players because that brings out more cards into play and allows for a more wild ride. Based on hand management and a good amount of luck, Isla Dorada is not heavy on strategy but the components are very vibrant and it is easy enough to be pulled into the theme.

Can serve as a second level gateway game; the various cards and the associated powers may turn off some newbies though. Having someone who has played the game teach through a round or two should go a long way in helping new players get a hang of the game.

Guaranteed - half of every game group will despise this game. I don't agree that it's chaotic, nor that the adventure cards are overly powerful with their "take that" effect - but many seem to disagree.

Very straight forward route marker game, with a combination of Elfenland/Ticket to Ride route planning and rewards with some nasty Citadel-like effects. Decision making is often clear, and you just have to hope that others send expeditions to the right place. Not overly chaotic, but there is a lot of luck. If you can play it in an hour, it's not bad. Verging on a kid's game, looks gorgeous and the dozen or so different cards aren't that hard to keep a track of.

A decent, but not great, light game - to a large extent luck-based, and with lots of opportunities to screw your fellow players (and most times you do this, you don't even know you were doing it, which can add to the fun or seriously detract from it, depending on mood). Not one to take too seriously, but good fun in small doses.

I also have to say that FFG thought out the game board very well.  The city name are written upside down and right side up to make it easier to read them and they color coded them with the cards to help you find them on the board.  Big thumbs up for the layout and componets.

Egy kis Ticket to Ride, egy kis Elfenland és egy gyönyörű dizájn és kész is az Isla Dorada. Igazából le kellene szólnom a játékot, mert szinte semmi újdonság nincs benne, hanem két régi nagynevű játékot gyúrtak össze, de az az igazság, hogy nagyon jól működött. A TTA lapszerzős mechanizmusát úgy bolondították meg, hogy a fix 10 pénzünkből 1-et pluszban minden körben arra költhetünk, hogy még egy kártyát húzunk az ingyenes egyen felül. Az Elfenland útjárását pedig licitálóssá tették, ahol a kártyáinkkal licitálunk, hogy merre menjen a közös felfedezőfiguránk. Győzelmi pontokat úgy szerzünk, hogy ha adott helyre elér a figura ott minden átok (mínusz pont) és győzelmi pont kártyánkat ki kell játszanunk. A játékot a renget fajta módosító kártya színesíti. Tehát a harmadik, ma igazán népszerű elemet a sokfajta kártyát is belerakták a játékba és azt kell mondanom nagyon jól egybegyúrták. Nagyon jó játékélmény volt az Isla Dorada. Negatívumot talán annyit tudok mondani rá, hogy a bónusz titkos célkártyák között vannak azért balanszolási gondok, illetve eléggé keresztbe lehet tenni konkrétan valakinek és ehhez a könnyednek tűnő játékhoz képest kicsit hosszú a 14 kör, de jogosan ennyi. Szóval bátran ajánlom kipróbálásra, kellemes játék.

Stinky card-flipper from Bruno, who really can do better. I give it one point for the artwork, and one for the stylish minis, and that's about all there is that's decent about it. It reminded me of playing Bang! with a map: no strategy, no control, no interesting decisions, lots of downtime, and completely driven by the luck of the draw from too many different decks of cards.

RATING: 7
I love the design and production of this game. The pieces and artwork are probably my favourite of any game I own. The game itself is quite simplistic in the way the auction system works but I like the unique twist of making everyone move around the board with the same playing piece. Feels a little too chaotic or luck based though some times.

RATING: 7
Fantasy Flight has done a great job with this one.  I like the mix of bidding, card collecting, and card play.  There is also a nice balance of chaos, luck, and strategy.  The board and components are beautiful.  This game is a remarkable discovery.

RATING: 6
Well, the production quality is wonderful, and that is my saving grace with this one.  The game is actually quite fun and I would play again, but I wasn't too hot on all the random cards that came out and the rest of the luck involved.  I mean, I like luck, but yikes!  A little too much for me.  Still fun, though, we still love ya Bruno.

Played two or three times. This game is good fun. Inevitably takes longer to play than it should. Most downtime when a player is deciding whether to purchase a second card with one of the valuable gold coins.

RATING: 6.5
Silly fun that can be enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously. This can be a bit challenging because you do have some long-term strategy and strategic decisions that can be made. It is a bit long for what it is, which drags down the rating somewhat, but still worthy of occasional play for the intrigue of the combined bidding.

Bidding to decide group movement for 3-6 adventurers "Lost" on an island, with secret goals and card drawing like 'Ticket To Ride' plus more.  Great artwork and production value.  A colourful game in more than one sense.  All our family thought it was fun (wife and daughter insisted on playing 3 games straight) - even me, who didn't win a game.  More going on than TTR, but still easy to get the play sequence down pat.  A pity it can't be played with 1 or 2 players, but a good game for the family, or non-hardcore-gaming friends.

RATING: 6
Played this once. A nice game, and very well produced, but I was dismayed to find that I had zero chance of winning from the very beginning of the game due to the fact that the treasure cards I drew were less valuable than everyone else's. That's just annoying, and there's no way to catch up if that happens to you.

1 play, BGG.CON '10

This started out as a quick little game while Mary was away doing something or other. But then she joined us, so we went through the rules. Again! And we played this way slower than it should be played ... about 1 hr 40 minutes, I think! It's an interesting game, but definitely needs another play (faster!). I think, though, that it will be a bit too much take-that, and chaotic, for me. And I definitely wouldn't want to play it with 6 again!

It's sort of like Expedition -- one marker (very cool totem pole thing that looks like it's got all the players' faces carved into it!) being moved around to various locations on the board, with players having secret destinations in mind -- crossed with Elfneland -- movement requires specific transportation cards depending on the type of terrain being used -- but with an auction each turn to determine the next stop. Players goals are determined by treasure/curse cards randomly distributed at the start of the game, then at specific points during the game (as well as through play of special action cards). Cards are distributed at the start of the game, then slowly drawn (from face up display or the draw deck) through the game: cards can be a tight resource! 

Hand management seems to be a nice idea, but I don't think you can have much control, at least with 6 players -- there will almost always be someone else who can redirect the expedition when necessary. And if, at the beginning of the game, you happen to get goal cards away from everyone else's cards, you're not likely going to be able to direct the expedition that way. The teleport/flying cards can really throw a wrench into your plans! 

Finally, the production is nice but the god-awful names are all weird and difficult to find. Yes, the locations are color coded and even written upside down (in smaller font), but it sure would've been nice if the names were more "normal", and if the cards included a map on them to help find each city!

Even though Isla Dorada has many flaws and is in no way a deep strategical game, it does not try to be. For me, Isla Dorada is sort of a party game that I strangely enough actually like. The lack of complex rules and the interactivity of the bidding mechanic make for a good introductionary game for newcomers, where it also helps me filter the audience: if you can't easily grasp Isla Dorada, no offence but then I probably don't want to play boardgames with you. Furthermore, the artwork and component quality are exceptional and really draw players in, especially the cards and the detailed miniatures. If you acknowledge Isla Dorada for what it is, it is quite a good game.

An auction game with "Take that" mechanics.  Even when I got the totem to go in the direction I wanted, someone would play a card to mess that up.  Over all just a very frustrating game.

This is a perfect party game, provided you have the right people. We really get into the theme and really have a fun time trying to pursuade the group to go our individual ways.

In this game you are part of a crash landed expedition on a remote exotic island and bid for the destination of the expedition. Sometimes with and sometimes against the other players, trying to reach or avoid certain locations.

The most fun game I played recently. The components, plastic figures, art, gameboard look awesome. Also one of the few games lately where I don't think the box is oversized. And the most important thing: the gameplay itself is fun.

There are some balance issues with the number and type of destiny and treasure cards, but house-rules can help here. An official solution for this would increase my rating. My other minor concerns are that the cards should have included small maps to easier find the locations like in Mission: Red Planet and I'm not 100% satisfied with the location names.
 
So in one sentence: The game is Fun, Fun and FUN.

RATING: 7
First play was with 6 newbies who probably over-thought things a bit. About 2.5 hours of diminishing fun. The take that was OK (& I speak as the main target, having been fortunate to score a couple of treasures early). Perhaps the biggest reservation (apart from playing with over-thinkers) is that in any round, only one or two players will really be competing. In Taj Mahal, we see this as "biding your time". Here, it was perceived as "nothing to do". There again, I’ve never had a 2.5 hour game of Taj.

Subsequent 3/4 player games (with newbies) all moved along nicely, with or without the cooperative bidding variant.

New players need to be forewarned of the amount of take that, and that being perceived as the leader makes you the obvious target. Using most of your cards to seal a route is a sure-fire way of sitting out the next few rounds and going with the flow.

The variety of cards is a bit daunting for casual gamers. The player aid is fine but could be better (grouping types of cards).

This reminds me a lot of Expedition, but its got a lot of extra complexity that doesn't add much to the game, and a much bigger luck factor. Seriously? Take a solid family game, add so many rules it not really a family game anymore, and then make it a luck fest?

I was thinking this would be much better with a rule to let players combine bids for a direction, ala Santiago. Turns out that's a variant in the rulebook.

UPDATE: Played again, this time with 4 people instead of 6. This went a lot better with 4; not nearly as much chaos, and we were all bidding regularly.

+1 to my rating with 4 players; -1 with 6.

I liked it.  I thought the bidding to move was a nice mechanism. I thought the game was going to be all 'take that' from a rules read through but those types of cards can be played at just the right time to get you where you want to go.  Plus, you have to make a choice for them along with the bidding cards so they are not abundant.  I wouldn't want to play it all the time but it's a nice change and it looks great.  I got lucky and did not receive a high penalty curse card (twice) but others did not fare so well and it hurt them.  I won so I am giving it a good rating!

Slightly overlong for what it is and through random card distribution, you may end up never getting to where you want to go because the group consistently votes against you. The lightning bolt cards also add a bit too much randomness (though it is a family game) and since they chain, can be potentially very powerful.

It is gloriously overproduced, in a fun cute kinda way.

Holy Crap, I'm loving this one.  I played 3 or 4 games yesterday... It was more fun when I was amped up on caffeine, by the end of the evening after a long session that included other games, I was wiped and wasn't quite as fun.  But a good solid "peak" game to play when everyone has energy.  Not necessarily a session ender, I think I'd prefer something smaller and lighter for an end of night game.

Olyan Jamaica feeling-em van. Túldizájnolt játékelemek, fantáziavilág, kitalált helynevek egy kitalált szigeten, végtelenül kidolgozott grafika a kártyákon. Szóval rendeteget dolgoztak a dizájnon, de mellétettek egy végtelenül hétköznapi és majdnem teljesen random játékmechanizmust.

Az a kategória, ahol a túlontúl kidolgozott tematika már előre sejteti, hogy mennyire gyenge lesz a játékmechanizmus. Hosszasan tudnám sorolni az idegesítő grafikai- és játékelmeket. 

Csak egy apró jó ötlet volt benne, mégpedig hogy a játéktáblára a mezők neveit egymás alá rendesen és fejjel lefelé is felírták, hogy az a játékos is el tudja olvasni, akinek fejjel lefelé van a tábla.

So much is outside of the player's control that Isla Dorada's sole ability to entertain is through charm.  The mission cards are unbalanced and if the group does not want to visit a key city, you'll never get there.  The bidding is nifty, and you'll recognize elements of classic games, but they are brought together here with choas and frustration.  With diverse goals, the group will become deadlocked in the same central cities over and over again--trapped an arm's length from fun.

Travel around a mysterious island trying choosing direction of travel by bidding against other players... With better names this would be a little easier, and the number of card types/symbols make this more difficult than it needs to be. It feels like a family game wrapped up in some complexity. Still really enjoyed the trip around the island, and would play it again.

I don't know what draws me so much to this game-- unlike most of the other games, it's almost entirely random, you can't really control even what's in front of you except in certain cases-- but every time I play it, I find it highly engaging. 

The particularly fascinating mechanic is the bonus card draw that gives you a boost-- so unlike a lot of similar games, there really is no such thing as a level playing ground. But at the same time, there's just enough options and "interrupts" that it doesn't just play itself, but you have to stay engaged.

In the middle of the 30's, an expedition of treasure hunters crashes its zeppelin in the middle of an unknown and mysterious island where legends tell that several old and powerful civilizations have left many sumptuous treasures.
\13\\13\
Each player is one of these brave explorers who joined the expedition with old maps giving clues on where some of these treasures can be found. However, it is clear that the land is barely known and dangerous, so, all explorers decide to travel together, in one solid group by hiring beasts of burden and exotic items in the native villages while trying to avoid the many dangers of the inhospitable land of Isla Dorada...
Which one of these brave explorers will find the most valuable treasures, avoid the numerous curses and accomplish it's rewarding destiny?
\13\\13\
In Isla Dorada, players will have to move an unique pawn portraying the expedition of explorers. Each player will collect cards of different kinds (movements, actions, destinations, curses, destinies, bonus or malus cards) and will have to build the best hands turn after turn (time is limited to a certain number of game turns) to be able to chose the expedition destinations in a succession of bids and negotiations. Doing so, the players will try to put their hands on treasures while avoiding their cursed destinations and trying to block other player's objectives.

The easy rules can be learned in a few minutes whilst the rich and elegant gameplay assure an always renewed experience.

There were three cards in this game that just ruined it for me.  Two of them were "take that" cards where you had to select two other players to discard cards or take on curses.  What's the point?  Either have a benefit to the card or annoy everyone.  Plus, they furthered the lack of strategy since you could be trying to build up a good bid hand and wham someone craps on you randomly.  The third crap card was the one that caused the deck to be reshuffled and forcing the two other crap cards back into play.  This pushed the game way to far into the pure luck and chaos category for me.  So why do I have a copy?  There's a simple fix for the ugly cards.  Either remove them, or house rule them to make them effective equalizers, such as targeting the player with the most cards (hoarders).  Those fixes combined with good components make this a bearable Euro but only because I also got a copy for cheap.

The rest of my gaming group liked it better than I did.  It's reasonably fun if you know in advance what you are playing - a chaotic game with little control and a lot of "take that" that plays 6.

A reworking of Elfenland that is mechanics-light and production-heavy.  It's Fantasy Flight, so no surprise there.

I can't stand Elfenland because players spend an inordinate amount of time planning their moves.  All of that disappears in Isla Dorada because there's only a single moving expedition that travels by vote (terrain-based card auction).  So it's move/score, move/score, etc. - a total of 16 times - until the game ends.

The scoring is based on location-specific treasures (positives) and curses (negatives), although the treasure cards aren't unique.  So voting the expedition into a certain location can end up benefiting other players more than yourself - especially when it comes to the endgame scoring of the destiny cards.

Beyond the adventure cards that are strictly for bidding, Dorada also has a ton of special cards, both benign and vicious.  So it's a lucky, sloppy heaping of pot pie, to be sure, but when all is said and done the pie ain't half bad.

[I won a copy at Maryland's EuroQuest, so my opinion of the game may be unduly jaded.]

Update:

It can be tough to avoid your curse location early in the game before you've had the chance to build up a reasonable hand size and distribution.  More is not necessarily merrier, either, since with 5-6 players the game drags in places (card selection, etc.) and the bids become unbeatable too quickly.

Also, at least once per game, there is a strong likelihood that one or more players will benefit tremendously from another player's steering of the expedition to a particular spot.  It's a kick for those particular players, I suppose, but it's an eye-rolling exercise for everyone else.

What this all means is that, if you're looking for a ringing endorsement, you'll need to look elsewhere. I'll gladly play Isla Dorada while it's new and shiny, without any regrets - but in a year I wonder how much tabletime this will get.

Destiny cards and bidding mechanic combines well to create tension and interaction between players. Components are of good quality, particularly the 3 figures. There may be a tendency to store up the stronger Adventure cards until late game. Suspect scalability.

This is unlike all the other games I own. It is an interesting game and one that is well suited to playing with more casual gamers. The place names and card names make the game needlessly inaccessible and can be a barrier for some. Not everyone likes the idea of there being a shared playing piece for all players.

Isla Dorada is a very funny take-that negotiation game. Funny in the sense that it leads to laugh out loud moments, a lot of cringing, and plenty of cursing. The board and components are beautiful, and it's a steal at €40!

However it is highly chaotic, luck-driven, and quite mean (yes, I'm referring to the Panda card). This greatly lowers my overall appreciation of the game, and puts in the territory of games that I can enjoy every once in a while, and preferably intoxicated as well. :p

I have friends who claim that skill wins out, but I fail to see it after our series of games so far. In games were your scores end up in the 30-40s, you can easily score 18-24 points in one turn - now that's way swingy!

I had no meaningful decisions to make for 3/4 of the turns and nearly won the game.  Chaotic, random, and fairly boring.  Mind numbing 6-way tug of war.

Another decent passing time game, but no real depth of strategy involved.  I had a fine time playing it.

A little long for what it is, but involved negotiation (play that version yes) makes it fun, and agonising at the same time.

This was a lot of fun. I love that there is only one player piece and we have to bid to decide where to go.

Fun partygame. It's good fun walking other players to their doom or glory. Wish there was a bit more card management. Should try it with more than 4, might go up in score then.

A stunningly beautiful game with lots of cards, tokens, and action.

My main problems with the game are that I feel it goes about 20-30 too long, and it lacks clarity. 

This is basically a family-weight game, yet there are so many different card types, and so many effects, that it pushes the game out of that family-weight category and it stays on the shelf while I pick something with a little more ease of play.

Великолепная игра - приключение. Оригинальная механика передвижения группы голосованием. Красиво выполнена. Единственно, больше двух партий за раз - перебор.

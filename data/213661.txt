A good introduction to Glory To Rome system.  but the game itself is just a little too light to my taste.

Glory to Rome clone with food...sure.  Actually, this is quite fun, and better than Glory to Rome if you ask me.  I've said the same about each subsequent clone that I've played actually--Uchronia, Mottainai, etc.  This iteration has a fun theme that everyone can enjoy, and it is fun and accessible to just about anyone.

A much lighter Glory to Rome, which I love.  If I didn't have time to play Glory to Rome, might choose this as a filler.  I played the kickstarter version.  Those who played it tonight thought the game was pushed out before it was ready--rule changes with sloppy almost corrections have followed.

Quite an involved cardgame, but still it took me a while to get the different roles and actions. Upscale quicker, hire personnel and get more ingredients and orders to fulfill. Not a bad game.

Kickstarted. The game itself is good, once you get your head around the rules. The rulebook is a bit confusing, and a player aid would have been helpful. The quality of this edition is a bit disappointing: the card stock is far too flimsy for a card game where cards get repeated use, and the player boards are much too thin.

Might change this rating after more play through of the game.  The learning curve, or more accurately the deciphering the rules curve, felt fairly high.
As this game is going to see a larger release perhaps the rules might be improved since their KS launch.
All of that said, it was a fun game. Once we sorted out the meanings of things that you had to play to understand the game settled into an enjoy routine of actions that culminated in a pleasant experience.
Will play again, no promises that it'll get a better rating.

I wanted to like this, with its lovely artwork and nicely designed, multi-use cards, but it just didn't feel right. I wasn't the only confused player when the rules were given. The player boards don't look or feel like trucks at all, and the odd circle icons don't really convey anything. It also felt loooong for what it was. Same old issues as other "card tucking" tableau games suffer, and the multi-directional cards don't really work well unless you do tuck them (if it were a digital game, they would work great). Could maybe be a good game with more work.

Move over Glory to Rome, Mottainai, Uchronia, there is a new king!  A lighter version of the previous game and more like the depth of Uchronia but with a theme that makes sense.  This game is so much easier to teach because the staff, ingredients, and recipes all make sense.  Add on the expansion and you get the extra depth of Glory to Rome, Mottainai.

RATING: 8
I think it will eventually get to a 9.  Not a Glory to Rome killer, but different enough to be worth having both.  It is much easier to teach than GtR.

RATING: 5
It plays very similarly to Glory to Rome, but it's much lighter. It's more of a eurogame. You win not by finding broken combos, but by being slightly more efficient than everyone else. Glory to Rome is the better game, but it's not readily available, so this isn't a bad alternative. Why oh why didn't this game come with rules summary cards?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First playthrough was good. Very toned down less complex version of Glory to Rome. The lack of powers from completed orders was disappointing but not a deal breaker. Could introduce people to this game first to get them to understand GtR better.

The game outcome is heavily influenced by the luck of what cards each player receives in their opening hand. A player with a bad opening hand can easily be left behind and trail the rest of the game.

It's okay. Definitely a bit too fiddly with all of the icons and card-tucking, and explaining everything proved to be tricky at first. People eventually got into the speed of things several rounds in, but it's just one of those games where the flow is probably a little more complicated than the weight of the game actually deserves. The scoring was close in our first game, but I got the feeling that not everyone felt like they had enough of a handle on things the whole way through.

Simplifying a couple of presentational elements might have gone a long way with this one. It's a neat theme.

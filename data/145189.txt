RATING: 6.5
This one is right up my alley, and can be quite difficult with all the overlapping dates. However, I would have preferred this set to be specifically about movies and/or recent pop history: all the classical music cards are "gimmes" when compared to the end-of-the-20th-Century movie & rock cards. The art is very unequal, from the good-looking (Shining) to the funny (Rocky) to the horrible (Love Me Tender).

I prefer the inventions version of this, maybe I'm just biased as it was the first one that I played. Very fun game that is educational also. Easy to learn and can play up to 8 players (or more if you adjust a few things) which is great!

RATING: 7.5
A good, fun, filler trivia game. Hurdles effortlessly over most of the usual problems with trivia games by not asking you to name specific years from memory, but rather intuit which of an increasingly-narrowing set of date ranges particular events fall into.

Fails miserably at useful-packaging-design, however, with a tin which is not only far too large for the contents but also has an embossed lid and therefore cannot be easily stacked!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The trivia contest about events you ignore expands: this time you’re allowed to make your mistakes though as long as you utter «I’m hopeless with pop culture» as a precautionary formula before starting playing, since this «Music and Cinema» expansion’s focus is, well, on music and cinema, mostly from the late Sixties to nowadays.
On the one hand it’s way more difficult than the previous expansions, as the time range is pretty short (and years often overlap), so small uncertainties might be decisive when needing to put a card before or after another; on the other hand, events are generally better known to everyone, on a rough scale.

This isn’t my favorite expansion («I’m hopeless with pop culture») but would enjoy it a lot more if there were more movies and less songs from the last ten or twenty years: most of times, I don’t even know who the singers are.

I used to close my previous comments with a gloss: «That is one of the rare moments in today’s barbaric age when you can openly take pride in your (usually scorned) humanistic background and crush your opponents, see them driven before you and hear their womanly lamentations».
Well, looks like it’s now out of place in this expansion: a humanistic background is likely to be scorned here once again.
But at least most of the non-humanists show the same troubles with this expansion as we humanists do.

Con el grupo adecuado (fans de la música y el cine) te da para un rato de "¿Cómo puede ser esa película de 1982?" o "Si esto es del 2001 significa que ya soy muy viejo". En resumen un filler que se explica en dos minutos y a jugar. Como pega se quema rápido en el sentido que en una tarde después  de tres o cuatro rondas ya se empiezan a repetir las cartas y si hay gente con buena memoria se acaba la marcha. Pero se puede sacar dos o tres semanas después y vuelve a funcionar.

To me, Timeline is quite a cool trivia game. I don’t love it (as my rating reflects), but with the right crowd (often non-gamers), this is an excellent game. It’s easy to teach and play and is educational; I love the moments when you go “what, is it so few years ago?!” or something like that. 
“Music & Cinema” is probably my least liked of the Timeline games as I personally don’t know a whole lot and isn’t really that interested in music. Still, if mixed with other editions, it’s a fine game.

It's basically a trivia game. But you don't have to know the exact date - a rough estimate can sometimes be enough.

And since you can mix up all the different sets, replay value is still there. Or can you remember over 500 dates? :D

RATING: 7
Very simple gameplay that is easily taught. The concept is that you have a few cards that have an event or invention or something like that on both sides but only one side has the date on it (year). A card is flipped over to show the year in front of everyone, say 1914 for the start of World War I, and then you have to place one of your cards either before or after that date depending on when you think your event occurred. If you get it correct, the turn passes to the next person. If you are incorrect, you draw a replacement card. As people get correct answers, the timeline grows and the gaps get smaller and smaller as events are placed closer to each other (maybe someone else plays a card for 1910 and you know your card is around that same period - it can definitely mess you up). First person to place all their cards wins. The game is the same with each Timeline set, they just have different themes. You can also mix them together which is a nice plus. This game could definitely be used in an educational setting, but I still find it enjoyable to play just for fun.

Good game to play sporadically with my non-gaming family members and friends.  Proved to be a hit for Christmas 2015 and 2016.  

We play with 6 sets mixed in together (Discoveries, Diversity/General Interest, Historical Events, Inventions, Music & Cinema and British History) and even then you start getting the same cards again fairly quickly.  However, none of us have particularly good memories so it doesn't matter too much!  If you're playing with people who have good memories then I'd recommend mixing at least 2-3 sets together.

A nice party game, extremely simple to teach and fun for everyone. It sidesteps the usual problem of trivia games, which that they are often too easy or too difficult. Since you place your card in the timeline, you can use your intuition or vague memories. 

One big flaw is the very low replayability. There are only a hundred or so cards in a set, and you quickly go through them and learn them. I have no doubt the game would really shine with a much bigger pool of cards, especially of different themes. But each box is pretty costly, and overpriced already, so getting 2-3 of them just as a starter is not very enticing.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2014)

As I like all the previous Timelines, it is no surprise that I also like this iteration. This is a very hard topic for me and I have lost every match I have played so far. Most players are a little older than me AND I know almost nothing about music. 

Music & Cinema is harder if you play it by itself because most of the dates are very close to each other. For the same reason it loses some complexity when you mix it with all the previous sets (which sadly I did :/). I recommend that you play this alone a few times before mixing it the rest of the Timelines.

Still a solid game for me and I plan to play it many times more in the near future.

It took a couple of years, but I’m finally tired of playing Timeline. Nowadays, I almost never want to do this and I usually resist it. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating, however I think I will keep them in my game collection, at least until I try Timeline Challenge. I would still play it from time to time.

Timeline: Music & Cinema is no longer among my favorite games of 2013.

Put the cards depicting classic music and cinema you have into the right spots on the developing time line based on their year of release: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears them all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but you will find this is MUCH EASIER than all the others if you're of a certain age because most of the releases are seminal ones like Citizen Kane, Sgt. Pepper's and Nevermind. Throw it in with other sets to give other players a chance.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive
BIG MINUS: size of the cards, lack of challenge for most of them

Timeline: Music & Cinema is a card game played using 110 cards. Each card depicts a historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.

A fun and accessible card game that can be played by pretty much anyone. You don't need to be an expert to play this card placement game, in fact some of the biggest laughs can come when you make a hilariously wrong guess. Definitely light but a fun filler.

This one is less interesting in the game series as it is much more of a standard trivia thing with compressed time span and less spread, and very dependent on specific knowledge, and not very accessible to kids, for example.

Perfect for non-gamers, or when you need something light.  Replayability is definitely an issue, unless you have other timeline games to mix together.

Music and Cinema is a very skewed set; the majority of the cards are from the 1900s or later.  However, should be good fun for anyone who is a cinema or music buff.

This is a very light game of trying to place key dates within the chronology of an ever growing timeline. 

It is a game but is heavily knowledge based and over-familiarity can reduce the fun to be had and competitive nature of the game.

Production wise the games in the series are just gorgeous to look at and many a collector will buy them for that reason alone. 

This is something very differnet for a person's collection and is also perfect for families and school's as an educational resource.

The series is also great for dinner parties as conversation starters.

Worst of the lot - I've pulled from my deck with all of the other cards.  Makes the 20th century a mess and only a serious video/audiofile would be able to place these intelligently along the timeline.

The biggest charm of the game is making a guess and being terribly wrong - 500+ years off - whereas it's just irritating to be off by two years on some obscure 80's pop album.

RATING: 7
Basically the same game as Chronology, except that you have a common timeline rather than each player having a timeline, so it gets the same rating and comment. It's a simple and enjoyable mechanic. Choose one of your cards and place it in the right spot in timeline order (from earliest to latest) amidst the previously placed cards. Fail and you draw another. First one to get rid of their cards wins. It can only really be played with people of the same age and background to be enjoyed by all, but it comes in at the right length, and can be an nice way to pass the time with friends.

RATING: 6
Decent filler that anyone can instantly understand how to play. It is more of an activity then a game but it is entertaining. Re-playability suffers once you start recognizing cards.

I'm not one of those 'trivia guys', who knows heaps of movies, artists etc. but this was loads more fun than expected. I found it fairly challenging too as most music and cinema (in this game) arrived in the 60s - 2000s. Thus if forces you to be more exact with the year you guess in the timeline.

This set has more overlap in dates and seemingly more obvious groupings. More people are generally familiar with these events than the events in the other sets  (which is kind of a bummer). This makes it harder to get things right and folks seen more irritated when they miss. That puts it a tick below the other sets for me.

Nice enough filler, but there are better ways to spend time gaming than trying to remember what year Pulp Fiction came out.  Not really game-y enough for my group.  Oh, and I have one group member who hates any kind of trivia and goes out of his way to ruin it for others, so...yeah, I'm not bummed that I bought it, but it probably isn't going to see much play time.

Basically the same as Anno Domini, with the same limited topic in a set. This one has only one third of the cards though, albeit prettier cards. To make a decent game of it you need to mix the other topics of Timeline into the one game - which makes it a pricey game - or buy the 220 card mixed version.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Certainly the topic specific deck drags the rating down on this one as a stand alone game.

Music & Cinema is an odd one because it is obviously so focused in such a short space of time. Mixed in with other expansions these cards all tend to clump together in the timeline. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, I'm not sure, but it's another fun addition to the Timeline series.

RATING: 8
Possibly the most difficult Timeline set because the dates are closer together. And if you're like me, you tend to remember "that movie is from the early 70's," or "that song is from the mid 60's" so it can be hard to guess where things fit in when several 60's and 70's dates are already on the board. It's still nice to have a set that's more relateable to a lot of people.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Steve

Why we culled it: Timeline is awesome, regardless of the topical focus of a given set. It encourages historical trivia without directly punishing you for a less-than-eidetic memory. Players have a hand of cards listing a significant event. They cannot see the date of that event, which is printed on the reverse. A timeline forms on the table, in which players must insert a card from their hand into the appropriate place on the timeline. It begins very easy, but the guesswork becomes more and more difficult as the dates fill in and players have smaller windows to target. It is a lot of fun. It does, however, play a bit unfairly between people with extensive historical trivia and those who do not, particularly in the later game (knowing the exact year of an event means you should hold those cards for when precision becomes necessary). In the end, we really enjoy it, but rarely find a place for it in our rotation, so we decided to find it a better home.

This edition of Timeline is much harder than you think. In this collection, the cards depict songs, albums and movies as well as giving a hint about the artist, composer or director.  At first you think this is pretty easy because you get Bach, Mozart and Beethoven cards.  Then you draw Taxi Driver and Jaws - gah, which came first ?

The moment you think this favors older players, you will draw a sequence of Riannha, Britney Spears and Lady Gaga.

As with all Timeline games, it plays quickly and generally gets a laugh or two.  The deck is significantly smaller and with enough plays, could suffer from memorization issues.

I just have to accept that this game just isn't for me. In fact, the entire timeline series is a bore. Plus, once you play a few times, you are likely to remember the dates pretty well and if the topic or theme is close and dear to your heart, you can pretty much make out like a bandit and win easily.

with such low replayability, I just cannot recommend this game or the entire timeline series.

Mint az Idővonal, de ez a magyarított, fémdobozos kiadás, zenei és filmes mérföldkövekkel. Az erősségei és gyengeségei is ugyanazok, mint az alapjátéknak.

A kettő nem kombinálható, részint az felölelt időtáv miatt, de az sem teszi könnyűvé, hogy ez a kiadás mini méretű kártyákkal dolgozik. Viszont kapható más témában még 1-2 doboz, amiből ki lehet kerekíteni egy nagyobb paklit, a jobb újrajátszhatóság érdekében.

All Timeline games grind out the same basic mechanics, but the endless expansions are tolerable because they're short and promote lifelong learning of different disciplines.

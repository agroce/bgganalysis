[2-5] I've yet to play this BUT I have to make a note regarding the game. This game involves, hands down, one of my favorite sections of a novel. Of course, this is colored by nostalgia but the move from the Shire to Bree and then on to Rivendell is just bliss. The quiet country community haunted by creeping shadows, the quickening chase, the eventual encounter with Strider at the Prancing Pony Inn and Pub. Even if the game itself is subpar (which I highly doubt based on initial reactions and my love for deduction games), i'm just pinching myself that I live in an era where I can play a board game version of this series of events. An absolute treasure for that alone. CANNOT wait to get it to the table. Thanks to all involved for the design.

Abstract:
Hidden movement game similar to Fury of Dracula. The game does not end immediately like in Scotland Yard, Frodo can flee or use special abilities that might generate corruption. The Nazgul try to win by generating corruption. Frodo can place tokens on the board to bluff or distract the Nazgul. 
The game's difficulty can be adjusted to make it easier or harder for the Nazgul.

Thoughts:
It is cool and innovative that the Frodo-player can play Gandalf who moves on the board like the Nazgul and deals with them.
All in all it is a really good game of its class, however, the play-time is a bit too long for my taste.

Hunt for the Ring is one of those hidden movement and deduction games that go back at least as far as the venerable Scotland Yard (1983).  In this case it is Frodo and his companions on the run from a quartet of Nazguls.  Commonly in this type of game, play for the hunters is a repetitious grind of counting spaces their opponent may have moved and searching likely locations.  Hunt for the Ring spices things up the options for the Nazguls a little by giving them a deck of spells and a set of action dice familiar from War of the Ring.  The designers apply plenty of thematic chrome through the spell cards and the Fellowship's companions and ally cards.  

The full game takes place in two halves.  There is the possibility of a first half victory for the Nazguls, but this seems a remote possibility with competent play by the Fellowship player.  In the first half the Fellowship player plots the movement of Frodo and his friends.  In the second, their movement is pre-programmed, while the player takes responsibility for the hidden movement of Gandalf.  The Grey One seeks to bolster the Fellowship's resistance to corruption and put the Nazguls off the scent.  This gives the Fellowship player some variation between the two parts.  However, for the Nazguls, spell cards, action dice and all, it's the same old same old move search/hunt/perceive.  And over the course of 3-4 hours I found the game wearing its welcome thin.    

Production quality and art are both excellent.  The rulebook is quite long, but not as wordy as some efforts we have seen from this source.

This is hard for me to comment on as I only played through the first half of the game. But it was enough for me to see that, while there are some neat elements here, it's not a game I need in my collection. 

My problem -- and this may not be yours -- is the length. It tooks us 2.5 hours to get through the first half. The rulebook says it may take a couple of sessions to finish so they give you "Gandalf's envelope" to save the game state. Whitechapel and Fury of Dracula are already long enough for this type of experience; this one felt too long for how interesting it is. 

The neat elements are that there's a War of the Ring type action dice system that creates uncertainty each turn. As does the hidden cards that each side has. I liked knowing that we Nazgul as well as the hobbits had tricks up our sleeves. I'm totally fine with "cancel that card" in a game like this. 

What I didn't like is that unlike the two aforementioned games, the hidden can move into/be moved into without having to reveal. The result was that we had very, very little hard information to go on. Most of our lengthy discussions were whittling down the possibilities to a handful of choices and then guessing from there. I get that that's an intentional design point, but I guess I prefer a bit more hard deduction.

I'd play again to give it another go, but I may sell/trade my copy before that happens.

Based on Part 1 only - will update after Part 2.

I haven't been the biggest hidden movement fan in games (don't care for Scotland Yard - but enjoyed Fury of Dracula enough).  I find that the hidden player simply doesn't have much to do and the hunters have to rely a lot on luck (but good planning also is key!)  I'm not sure if Hunt for the Ring totally ameliorates these issues, but thematically it is impressive, it is full of design to keep things as interesting as it can, and there's good moments of timing to enjoy. I'm very interested to see how Part 2 works out.

I'm a bit of a LotR whore so I might be a bit more forgiving. 

Overall, I liked the game. I've only played it once and it took a while to get a whole game in. But this is to be expected being the first run-through. 

With any game, there are aspects that I like and don't like but overall I'd say I enjoyed the game and like 90% of the play.

Review after one play (both sides). Very thematic and tense. The deduction seemed pretty tight, and the card play added a lot of flavor. It was also a good length at about an hour per side. I was initially thinking about playing a single side as a standalone game, but it is clearly balanced around playing both parts, so I'm not going to do that (it doesn't take that long anyway, and there's a save feature between games that works well).

Hunt for the Ring provides a wonderfully thematic experience for fans of Middle-earth. The game captures its intended feel brilliantly, giving players the sense that they are involved in a cat-and-mouse chase. The action dice provide enough limitation on the Nagzuls' options that they don't have free reign, while the Ringbear's party has several tricks up its own sleeve. The design requires a couple of thematic oddities to result in a balanced game (especially in Part 2, where Gandalf can disappear and reappear across the board and where Frodo and company can wind up taking a completely different path once discovered), but these don't detract from the fun of the experience. To be fair, without these things, the Ringbearer would truly have no chance. I like the fact that the game scales from 2-5p. I also really like the bust miniatures, which fit the feel of the game perfectly. Add in the amazing artwork by John Howe, and you have yourself a fantastic Middle-earth experience!

I love hidden movement deduction games, and this one passes up Whitechapel as my favorite to date. The rulebook is a little bit tough to navigate through the first game. I wish they had included a quick reference guide to easily find answers for specific questions. Otherwise, I thought the game was very well balanced (I lost as Frodo on the very last possible move, had I drawn a different corruption tile I would have won.) Part 1 and 2 last about 1 hour each in my group, though our first full game was closer to 4 hours.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Just to let everyone reading this know, Hunt for the Ring is the first hidden movement game I've played. 

I do not know where I land with this game. On the one hand I love the theme and overall I enjoy the hidden movement mechanic, but I really don't enjoy the second half of the game nearly as much. Hunt for the Ring has two distinct phases which may or may not be played in the same session. First you are trying to get Frodo to Bree and then on to Rivendell or if you are the Nazgul you are trying to get Frodo to accumulate a certain amount of corruption in order to win the game. During the first half of the game you are either trying to get Frodo to Bree [i](his movement is hidden and a player controls him)[/i] or you take on the role of the Nazgul trying to hunt Frodo down and corrupt him. To note, Frodo needs to be found multiple times to fully corrupt him, easier said than done. 

If Frodo reaches Bree and is not fully corrupt you flip the board over and play through the second half of the game. Now, Frodo needs to travel to Rivendell to win the game. However; while the game mechanics stay the same for the Nazgul player [i](who may get the Witch King into play)[/i] the Fellowship player is now playing a different game. On the trip to Rivendell you control Gandalf [i](who's movement is hidden)[/i] and try to disrupt the Nazgul while Frodo moves along a scripted path [i](there are a bunch of cards that have different paths he will move along)[/i]. 

Personally I found this a lot less satisfying than being in control of Frodo directly, much of the tension in the game disappears because you can't directly influence Frodo. And while Gandalf is powerful, he just isn't as fun to play especially since you can't ever kill/remove one of the Nazgul. And the penalty for Gandalf being found isn't all that bad. Some players may enjoy this role change and how the game develops, but I do not. I would rather continue playing the game as Frodo and try to get to Bree, but there is no way to do that based on the way the game is structured, all of the cards you have in the second half are geared towards using Gandalf. But wait, couldn't you just play the first half and then call it quits? Well technically yes, but it is almost impossible to fully corrupt Frodo during his journey to Bree, therefore winning as the Naxgul would be almost impossible. The game is balanced in such a way that the Nazgul player would have to get really lucky in order to accomplish that. 

So while I've decided Hunt for the Ring isn't for me, I'm now much more interested in finding a more pure hidden movement game. Recommendations are welcome, if your reading this in my comments feel free to send me a gm. I definitely think there are a lot of people who will enjoy the twists found in Hunt for the Ring, it is a well designed and mechanically sound game.[/i]

Picked up today and played first game with my 14 year old.  We only played part one, but it was very fun.  He smoked me as Frodo and only used, I believe, 4 corruption to do it.  It was all my fault though.  I caught him on around the 7 move and got it in my mind that he backtracked.  I used several stupid search moves looking for him, when he had cleverly slipped right down the center of my 4 Nazgul.  I searched and used hunt dice on almost every location except the one he used to escape.  Bonehead play on my part, but we loved it.  
It's already set up to play again tomorrow and we will continue on to the Gandalf side this time.  I play too quickly in a lot of games and it probably bit me in the butt on this one, but with two players, it took around an hour or a little bit less.  I highly recommend it.  We also have Fury of Dracula, which my family loves, but I can see this getting played a lot more than that from now on.

Love the detailed maps between Hobbiton and Rivendell. But the game play, especially the cards play, was too fiddly and brought too much chaos to my taste. It took out some of the suspense that should come naturally to a game like this.game length also sucked some fun out but I could see this improving as the game is learned.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun game. More complicated than Whitehall (which is the only one of these I played) which I think is basically a good thing. Each player has more options and more specials that they can play.  The theme comes through pretty well, which is pretty key for a game like this. The Fellowship seems a bit more challenging but that could just be my early impressions.  

While I liked it and would be happy to play it some more, I didn't fall in love. My buddy has a copy and that's good enough for me, no need to buy it myself.

RATING: 6
1 play, Part 1, 4er

It’s another hidden movement game like Scotland Yard, blended with some twists from the War of the Ring game:
- dice-based actions
- clever fuzzy movement, where the quarry’s exact location is somewhat flexible until you choose the next step on the path
- Frodo, working his way through the ally deck, can throw up road blocks to interfere with the Nazgul’s movements

Like those other games, though, I just don’t find this all that exciting! I think it may be more interesting than the others, if only based on the theme and clever mechanisms, but I don’t think having a bunch of people on the team makes this any better. I think I’d rather just play this game 2-player!

Part 2
Here, Frodo follows a set path (from a random card pull) while the Good Guys move Gandalf around. Gandalf is sort of a distraction, placing false bread crumbs for the Nazgul, playing allies, or, occasionally, scattering the Nazgul if they're getting too close to Frodo. If the Nazgul do find Fordo, there's a "fight" (they pull corruption tokens, the more Nazgul nearby, the more tokens pulled). Then, Frodo draws a new random card jumping to a completely new location (though still the same relative distance along the path towards Rivendell). It's almost totally random, EXCEPT that we were still able to deduce Frodo's position and find him at the last opportunity ... so maybe it works after all? 

I'm not sure Part 2 was all that great, either. Still need to try this 2er.

It feels like it shouldn't work, but it does! The WotR-ization of a hidden movement game with plenty of crufty chrome (including two different rule-sets for each half of the game) but a very, very solid under-structure and penchant for grin-inducing thematics arising mostly from the mechanics. 

If you like LotR and like hidden movement, this game is 100% for you.

This is a neat game dealing with the hobbits escape from Bree, on the one side, and on the other, their journey to Rivendell, all the while pursued by four Nazgul. A game of cat and mouse, to be sure, where the forces of Sauron must co-ordinate effectively to gain their quarry and the Ring Bearer and his allies race against the clock to escape across the boarders. A good game with plenty of replay value.

One vs All hidden movement as Frodo and the Fellowship try to get to Rivendell resisting the ring’s corruption track through a net of hunting Nazgul.  Frodo can play dual choice cards. Movement to dots between locations adds a clever evasiveness.  Nazgul actions are determined with special dice pool and hunt action uses token pouch pulling.  Frodo can deploy allied tokens to locations as obstacles or to bluff.  I like how these systems are used deliberately to create a usually exciting deduction, hide and seek experience.  My wife hates Fury but she will play this.

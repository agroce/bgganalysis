An interesting investment game like no other that I have played. Some cool concepts of travel tickets, investment lifespan and marginal point of return make for some neat situations. I need to play this one again to see how I really feel, as there is a lot to take in the fires time you play.

Hmmm...I really wanted to like this more than I did.  Whilst there were things in the game that I appreciated, it just wasn't as high on fun as I thought it would be, plus it was both a little too puzzle-like and also encouraged a lot of AP in the latter stages.  The lettering on the cards isn't easy to read if you're across the board.

Having said that there are some good mechanics at play here: the choice of which of two places to put the first warehouse in, the increasing interest of loans, the way the point for each city vary and also go down as well as up, the ability to knock off warehouses from a city, the extra variability of the 3 additional cities and the different ways you can navigate around with different cards.

Really, this is very well designed!  Only the readability of the artwork let's it down there.  Maybe if players played faster the AP problem would disappear.  I'll play it again and see what happens.

From the Reviews: It looks like a good game that has some tense moments and risk taking built into it. It is a reimplementation of tycoon and that was a fairly popular game so this has potential to be good. Looks a bit heavy for many folks to me

A mildly-interesting area control game. I think I've decided that I'm not a big fan of area control games in general, and El Capitan did nothing to dissuade me of this opinion. I don't see any novel mechanics at work and the game really wasn't all that much fun to me. There's absolutely no chance to catch up once you're behind. Plus, once you're "far" behind in building-placement (I had 2 leftover warehouses entering the third phase), it's pretty much guaranteed that someone else will be setting the clock for the rest of the game. Also, the script font used for the game is horrible - very difficult to read. Otherwise, the artwork is nice, although the game could probably use a different or another mechanism for identifying the 9 locations. The different banner patterns were useless except as decoration.

Even given the above, I would play it again though it wouldn't be a first or second choice for me. It's a solid game that provides many choices and uses money as a strong limiting factor.

From the low ratings El Capitan has received, I wasn't expecting much from it. Having played it, I'm left scratching my head as to why it's rated so low! Yes, it's an analytical brain-burner, but it's sooo good, and sooo tense! The first round and maybe the first couple of turns of the second round are somewhat dry, but it becomes an ever-increasing nail-biter after that.

Contrary to what everyone has said, there is no runaway leader problem. For example, in one game, going into the final round of the three rounds, I was (most definitely) the runaway leader; and I came in last! There are so many different ways a so-called runaway leader can be torpedoed. Perceiving that there is a problem with a runaway leader means that the other players aren't playing well. And it is quite an interactive game: not that you're trading with each other or combating each other, but in the constant nerve-wracking jockeying for position in individual cities.

The theme is thoroughly pasted on (and by the way, my fellow Anglophones, it takes place in the 1500's, not in the fifteenth century: I see this calendarical error in the English translation of too many German games!), but it doesn't really matter. The art is certainly nice, but I think a tad overrated. The font used for the cities is challenging at times, but not as bad as some people have suggested.

El Capitan is certainly a far better game than Herr Kramer's El Grande.

Nice area majority eurogame. Easy to teach and play with almost no setup time. There are only 3 possible actions but players are free to sail around Europe and timing is crucial. The mechanic that some of the older buildings get demolished and the way tie-brakers work is smart. The game gets a bit repeatitive and has considerable downtime with 5 players. Maybe 4 players is the sweetspot. The theme is completely pasted on.

SUPER dry, nearly themeless area control game. I'd compare it a bit to power grid, with a bit more luck (mostly in what movement cards you're able to acquire and when).

Played with 5 it went WAY over the box time. 

Not very complicated rule-set but seems like there's a lot of room for different strategies. The default area majority strategy of "second by a hair, EVERYWHERE" seems to work well, given the incentive to spread out early.

Un par de partidas inacabadas.

Tema ultrapegadísimo, extremo en ese sentido, aunque mira que los eurogames son todos así, pero en este caso roza el ridículo. 

Pero claro, ponemos algunos dibujos bonitos de Mike Doyle en el tablero y la caja y ya tenemos juego.

Su principal mecánica es el control de areas con toques de subasta y mayorías. Seco y abstracto. Como juego defrauda tanto a jugones como a novatos.

En su favor diré que la caja queda bien en la estantería.

The game looked OK as I was reading the rules until I got up to all the forced actions: you MUST play a piece on your turn otherwise you MUST take a loan.  That was a bit of a head scratcher in theory and in play.  The forced loan mechanic is technically interesting but I found it wonky.  Some seem to hate the art, I thought it was plenty usable with the dots.  I think the Tycoon theming looks much better though, and I'm really surprised that this game was considered good enough to warrant a reprint.  All the "choices" felt very constrictive to me.  Failure of a technically functional game, for my tastes.

With five players I think this is going to drag for a long period of the game. Not only will more people lead to more warehouses being knocked off the city tracks, often requiring a turn to replace them. There's going to be more actions taking place between each individual's turns as well so plans will more frequently be disrupted, leading to longer turns as the player thinks more.

Four players was good though, I think three may be too quick.

2009-09-24 Three players works about as well as four thanks to the extra knock-off points on each track.

2011-07 Three may now be my preferred player count, it seems to go by much faster, without a significant drop in decisions. (Still some drop as first/second place is easier to get.)

Elég sok finomság van a játékban, pl. a tornyokért kapható pénz, vagy a raktárak alapján megállapított sorrend fordulónként módosulhat. Mégis valahogy el van aprózva, nekem a kártyás rész túl körülményes benne. A legfontosabb, hogy ne dőljön ránk a hitel, de azért ne is kelljen túl sűrűn kihajózni hitelért, mert nagyon drága visszajutni a kívánt városba. Jó stratégiához szerintem elég sokat kell számolgatni, főleg hogy melyik kártyával mikor hova megyünk. Ha mindenki így tesz, vontatott lesz a játék. Elég volt ebből egy.

First Game.  2 player.  The game is pretty simple but just tedious on how to get from port to port.  Also the game is pretty abstract and dry.  There are interesting decisions to be made on when/where to place the fortresses and how many and when to place your wharehouses.  The mechanics on how to get to the ports were just too aggravating and draining for the results.  The designers should have gone away with the cards as a means to travel from port to port and just designated the costs to do so.  Maybe make them random from game to game so that the game has re-playability.  If someone comes up with a good variant for ship movement, I'd play the game again.

This game would probably play faster if the font was larger on the cities and cards.  As for gameplay, there is plenty of player screwage in shutting down certain warehouses. 

The expansion cities add some variety to the game.  Lisboa makes it easier to almost completely avoid the loan action.  The Pirate makes it even easier to target specific players.  Porto is basically a 12th city with cheap warehouse costs for larger payouts.  The downside to using the expansion is that it needs 4-5 players players, which only prolongs the game.  I think El Capitan is best with 3-players.

I have not played Tycoon which this game reimplements, but this is an enjoyable area majority game that has an elegant and sophisticated design that carries the Wolfgang Kramer signature. There isn't anything in particular that strikes out or sets it apart from other games, but what it does it does well.

El Capitan is a mid weight Euro where you are vying for control of different cities by building warehouses. Money is tight at the beginning, but seems to ease up as the game progresses. Managing your resources is the key to success and the game can be tight, tense and with a reasonable amount of player interaction. 

The presentation and the art are fantastic and set the mood. Yes, the fonts used for the cities can be hard to decipher, but nothing too visceral to distract.

In contrast to Municipium, which I got at the same time.  This is a game that I like more than I should.  On analysis there is nothing particularly clever here and the strategy seems pretty rote (diversification is just too good to pass up).  The destination cards feel like there should be more strategy in how you move about the board, but they really aren't that constraining nor do you save much by being efficient.

Despite all of that I do enjoy playing El Capitan (great name by the way).  I recommend the expansion vociferously, it adds some much needed flavor.

*update*

Second play went worse, another game group more demanding than in my first play made the game colder and dryer...

RATING: 6.5
An economic and area influence game based on the game called Tycoon, but there are some substantial changes.  This game has several mechanics and bonus points that encourage players to diversify (i.e. build warehouses in many different cities, rather than concentrating their influence)... the limit of 3 consecutive warehouses and the bonus cards for building in 9+ cities (base game) and the pirate protection/extortion fee (in the pirate variant) all encourage players to "seed the board".  

PIRATE VARIANT -- This variant makes El Capitan a very different game from Tycoon.  The pirate fee can be painful, but you need to fit it into your strategies.  So far, I like it.

Juego de mayorias, con un curioso sistema de colocacion de almacenes, en unos tracks q van subiendo de valor y despues comienzan a descender.

Hay 9 ubicaciones y uno se tiene q mover de una a otra comprando cartas. El dinero escasea en los primeros turnos.

Solo tiene tres turnos. La primera impresion es q es un poco soso, pero cuando avanza la partida te vas metiendo. Es de mucho calculo mental.

Es un juego muy barato. Menos de 20 €. Por ese precio es una buena inversion.

The improvements from Tycoon mechanics to new mechanics are countered by the beautiful but HORRIBLE to read graphics.  Takes forever to figure anything out as you try to read italic font and/or see tiny dots. If I play this again, I'll strongly prefer to use Tycoon board with El Capitan rules.

A decent game of route planning, efficiency and area influence. Not the best for this genre as it is a bit repetitive and limiting (build a warehouse or build a fortress or take a loan - that is the extent of the decision making in the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Absolutely gorgeous production - luxurious even.  Can't wait to play.

Update:  A very nice game with some very interesting balances.  Do you spend time and money building up your warehouses in one city...do you spread out across the board... be sure to get the cards you need before other players, be sure to watch their stock of warehouses and fortresses as they go down (for they might end the round before you are ready for it).  Be sure to also keep a keen eye out for those cities where a factory of yours may be closed down.

The loans are an interesting aspect to the game as well - do you pay them back when you can?  Do you extend them to keep the capital in hand, but have to pay them back later at a increased repayment.

A very clever game, once you get the hang of ship movement, and the fact that you need to be able to move, but don't want to be moving all the time - this is a great game.

Also very interesting with 2 players.

Also comes with the expansion - which adds some extra elements if you are getting tired of the base game.

All in all an excellent game with some cruel choices to make.

In Addition:  An absolutely gorgeous game - Doyle's art work and Z-Mans production are luxurious and a joy to play with.  This plays like a 'fine' game, and certainly looks and feels very fine also.

UPDATE: Another cool thing about El Capitan is how well it works with 3. The original Tycoon didn't scale that well from 4 to 3, but El Capitan does.
---
UPDATE: I really like El Capitan, and think it's a great, interesting, if somewhat weakly thematic game. But I think it's a game I'm doomed to like a lot more than anyone else around here does. I'm not sure why exactly, but it just hasn't gone over that well with most of the people I've played it with, even people who tend to like money games and route/empire-building games; maybe because it looks more like an area-control game. Anyway, a shame, I think this is really good, it's got all the charms of the  economic games of lesser designers in a clean, elegant package. I think complaints that the theme not particularly strongly presented are legitimate, but El Capitan is no worse than many popular economic games currently in the vogue in that respect.
---
I always liked Tycoon, but the gargantuan box size meant it never got played because you could never take it anywhere. The new, more reasonably sized box gets the game on the table again and reminds me that it is, in fact, quite good. For me it's got the same sort of tensions as Age of Steam - the network development, the money management, the extremely tight cash, the declining later-game incomes - but in a far cleaner, more elegant package with more player interaction and none of the pointy edges and gratuitous difficulty.

El Capitan comes with three expansion tiles, and if you're playing with gamers, I think it's worthwhile to throw in one of them even on the first game (especially if you try the game with 5). They seem to add some nice variability, a little edginess that the core game can sometimes feel that it could use. The game is still strong without them, but I think they are a nice addition (I rate the core game an 8, if I play with the expansions more maybe it'll kick up to a 9).

Haven't quite decided on the Mike Doyle presentation. I think he's suffering from over-hype. He's a talented artist and El Capitan is a very nice package - the striking cover, one of the best game covers I've seen in quite some time, is probably the best part. But I think he still definitely needs experience working with games, and recent interviews he's given have shown that his approach and appreciation for games (especially in the area of theme) is still a little narrow. That's fine, he's new to the field, and if it was just some unheralded new guy I'd be reasonably happy. But with the internet hype machine going in full gear, and with him getting box-cover billing as the artist (a first, as far as I'm aware) it's a whole different story, and his stuff gets put under the microscope ... for which I really think it's not ready yet. There are a lot of usability problems, and there is a lot of over-design which can't possibly be appreciated in a game and simply makes it look cluttered. I'm sure he'll improve, but he does not deserve top billing yet in my opinion; his work is not yet a selling point, outside of the nice box covers.

This game is really fun for the first two rounds, but really seems to peter out in the last round. It just runs too long for what it is. 75 minutes my ass.

I like games with just one currency (rather than trade blue for white, white for green, green for money etc.) Overall, pretty good. Awesome cover and artwork.

Quite interesting area majority plus route optimization game. Quite simple to teach, but takes one or two games to figure out how to play effectively, and requires constant arithmetic calculations. I like it, however. Especially the quirkiness of the declining revenues and warehouse ousting, the timing of the fort placement, and the symbiotic relationship these create. Good game.

Nice game. It has very simple mechanics and strategy is not very deep, so it is easy to get into.

I never played the original, so cannot compare to that; El Capitán is my first encounter with this particular game. After several games at 3 and 4 players, I noticed that the game changes character quite dramatically at different player numbers. With 3, the game is not particularly spectacular. The economic growth engine is simple and straightforward, resulting in not alltogether unpleasant gameplay. If you play with 4, however, the sweet simplicity gives way to rather nasty muscling-in-on-eachother's-turf behaviour. All cities will be completely filled in at some point, meaning that their revenue [i]will[/i] drop over time. If you were unable to cash before the inevitable decline sets in, you're in for a rough ride. I'm not sure I like the game at this number, simply because there is no way out of the death trap. It also takes far too long to end; or rather, there is too little diversity in what you can do from turn to turn to have it run for as long as it does. I really hate to think what would happen with 5 players, although I understand the game comes with extra material to give the players a bit more space.

The colour scheme of the design is acceptable, but the frilly font used to designate the port cities is murder on the eyes. In a blog posting in 2009, Mike went into considerable detail how he designed the graphics of this game. He admits there are two things wrong with it: the printer turned out the game much too dark&mdash;which by the way raises the question of test prints and the like&mdash;but also that he didn't push the 3x3 dots thingie far enough, causing players to become focused on the difficult to read font instead. You [i]had[/i] noticed that the dots indicated what the card allowed you to do, right...? Anyway, it's nice to see Mike admit that he made some errors here, and that graphical game design is a [i]little[/i] harder than he makes it out to be.

Components: Nice wooden components and thick cardboard money. This might be a thematic choice, but I wish the money were sized by denomination (right now the 10 is larger than the 5). The font on the location names is waaaay too difficult to read. Even looking at something right side up was difficult, but upside down it was nearly impossible, and the tiny dots on the cards could have been larger to help compensate better.

Thematically, I never felt like I was moving from exotic place to place. They are just squares on a board. Would have been much better with a gorgeous map. This game is purely about points, and not at all about setting up trading posts in far off places, or whatever it is we were supposedly doing.

Experience: The cards are somewhat clever, in that I must budget how to efficiently buy them so that I can move around the board as cheaply as possible. But it's very difficult to factor in trips to the bank. The bumping of houses is also clever, leaving a bit of uncertainty in how a particular city will score.

There aren't enough actions. An early mismanagement in the first round will haunt me for the remainder of the game, and almost ensure that I will end the game without having placed all my pieces. Being limited to one placement per turn just means that once a player is behind, they will stay behind.

Maybe I'm just bitter because I got hosed. I tried to hit all the cheap ports, to conserve my money, and to get the diversity bonus. Instead, I just ended up getting bumped in a lot of different places, and ended with less diversity than several other players. Another player scored big in the first round and was able to pay back all his debt and cruise to an easy victory (I'm not slighting his win, as he played quite well, but it didn't feel like anyone could catch up).

Just not my type of game. I sit there on my turn wracking my brain trying to figure out how to get from A to B, trying to save a dollar or two here or there, and then I lose by 120 points. Ouch.

(Didn't even notice that this was a re-working of Tycoon, but from reading my comments on Tycoon, I definitely enjoyed El Capitán less. Tycoon didn't feel like work; El Capitán feels like twenty years hard labor.)

An economical area control game with a pasted on theme (I mean, if we're sailing around the world, the least they could do was to draw an actual map there).  It feels as an exercise in accountancy and while almost everything in the game works as it is supposed to, the game is a bit repetitive and boring and does not offer anything that wasn't already done better in other games.  This one also has the additional runaway leader problem as rich only get richer and there really is no way to catch up.  Move along, nothing to see here.

RATING: 6
An area-influence game where you buy cards that give you access to certain areas of the board.  Depending on how many resources you devote to the area, you will score certain amount of points.  The problem I have with these type of multi-player games is that the games come down to arbitrary choices of which area's get competed over.  If you are in a highly competitive region, you can lose your investment and payoffs.  Some of this can be predicted, but mostly it feel really arbitrary as to which regions you lose majority in.  So while I like the game, I don't think it improves on the king of area-influence games...El Grande.

The bulk of the strategy consists of memorizing opponent's destination cards (which I hate), and tediously working out spend-x-florin-to-get-y-florin computations over and over and over again. As is typical of area majority games, there is nothing particularly "clever" or ingenious about the strategy--just linear and straightforward arithmetic. 

The movement mechanism is somewhat interesting, and actually requires some forward planning. But it can also be a bit random and dependent on luck. 

The saving grace of the game for me is the loan mechanism. Money [i]is[/i] victory points--I really like this intuitive approach, also used to really good effect in Modern Art. But in order to earn more money, one needs to borrow money at an interest rate to expand their trade empire. Players go from barely being able to pay off the loan in the first round to being able to fully fund themselves and more in the final round. This economic arch and the art of timely loans makes the game at least worthwile to play.

Just OK. This one was a little too AP prone. Especially in the final round there is so much data before you and you know the optimal move is to be found if you search long enough. Because of this, the game drags on too long. It also appears to suffer from runaway as there are few ways to prevent the leader from widening his lead.

Rating reflects desire to play this game again. Kramer's El Capitan is a well designed movement/majority game but it has two major weaknesses. The first being that the game is pretty heavy for the payout, and the second being that there are a lot of better, maybe faster economic games out there. Between those two factors, I see my desire to play El Capitan to be lukewarm at best.

RATING: 9
Good area-control game. By having each round ending when one player has placed his 6 warehouses and 1 fortress, it sets up a sense of urgency. And I like that loans are sufficiently punitive if they are not paid off promptly. Definitely will keep players on their toes. 

My only gripe - it's definitely lacking in the theme department...

A good re-working of an older game, Tycoon, there's enough here to stand against modern cube-pushers. I lost badly, but still enjoyed the game (I didn't spread out enough.

It would be intersting to try the extensions that come with the game, and to try it with more players.

El Capitán starts with the players having to dig out of a deep hole. What makes this even harder is that taking loans costs not only money but also time that would be better spent building warehouses that will actually earn you money eventually.

The theme does work rather well even though the gameplay itself is rather abstract, though I suppose a non-tabular city layout might have changed that impression. In any case, El Capitán is a solid area majority game. There is, however, not a lot of diversity in it so it tends to run a bit longer than it should. You actually need the time to get out of the hole I mentioned before but maybe they should have made the hole a little less deep.

Interesting, straightforward area majority mechanic. But in the end, that's all this game is. It's rare for an area majority game to lack any real sense of development. Super repetitive and gets thoroughly uninteresting by the end. This could have been an interesting 40 minute punchy filler, but with 5 players it was a 2-hour game that dragged. That being said, there's nothing broken with it and it has little elements here and there that show it's been designed by someone who knows what they're doing. (Which is Wolfgang Kramer and another designer I am unfamiliar with.) Overall, it feels dated and can safely be avoided.

"Loan" is not common in most boardgames, and I like how El Capitan incorporated this aspect. It adds a totally different dimension in the decision making.

Moreover, I especially like the mechanic where excessive fighting for the #1 and #2 spots in a city will eventually destroy value.

However, finding & constructing routes to different cities is a tedious task that I don't enjoy as much.

Beautiful graphics on the board but the players sitting opposite will have troubles to read the city names upside down. Basicly it's a majority game connected with light economy. Rating after one play with expansion cities. The income one can generate by sending the pirate to other cities is to powerful, most of all in the third round where you earn 3 gold per warehouse. I recommend do lower this to 1 gold per warehouse in each round and not increasing it. Otherwise there will be players that do [i]only[/i] generate their money by pirating not by building warehouses.
However the pirate adds interaction which is welcome. Overall a nice update to its predecessor Tycoon.

I really enjoy Kramer games, however, this one seems just a bit behind the curve. I need more plays to firm up a rating.

Kramer games seem have a certain visual aspect that helps players make sense of them. This aspect also gives a player visual reference points that help one understand some of his abstraction in his designs. I think it would be "better" if this could have been implemented here.

I certainly enjoy this game but find that teaching/learning it has a bit higher barrier to entry.

An interesting area control game with a weird travel mechanic included.  First of all, I don't get all the gripes about the graphic design.  The fonts are not hard to read, and even if they were the dots on the cards make things easy.  How can you complain about a game with this kind of artwork?  Its very distinctive and different for boardgame art, and it does seem to match the (weak) theme.

The gameplay is good, but its not something I would want to play every week.  The area control mechanics with the warehouses throw in some interesting wrinkles into the typical area control recipe.  You can shut down other people's warehouses, although they can put them back and place them further down the row - getting the winner of the area more money, but since ties are broken by first in line, often winning you the area.  It makes for a lot of tension that isn't typical for area control games.  The travel mechanic seemed a little extraneous and didn't add much to the game in my opinion.  Early on you bought up cards, and later in the game you figured out how to do what you needed to using those cards and spending as little money as possible.  The travel cards were more a pain in the ass where you tried to find a way to get where you wanted to go each turn and you usually could, although sometimes you would have to pay a little more than you wanted. 

There are a few different ways to victory, but I think with more experienced players the winning strategies would become less varied.  For example, I took loans out the wazoo and in the second phase, I think everyone had written me off for dead (including myself) but you can almost always pay them back at the end of the third phase.  On the other hand, we had players who were very frugal and efficient.  I'm not sure it makes that big of a difference.  My strategy early on was to lock down areas so that they weren't even attractive as 2nd place points for anyone, because I erroneously thought that (like in many area majority games) getting in a big battle with someone over an area would spell my doom.  So, I took a sort of "don't come in here" strategy.  Of course, I quickly realized that the areas people fight over are the ones that are worth the most in El Capitan, unless they are fought over too much.  Even with my crappy play at the beginning, I was able to do pretty well by the end game through proliferation scoring.  Getting proliferation early and finishing it before anyone else is key to this game.  The money you get early and the bonus points for proliferating first are huge.  The majorities in the cities will work themselves out if you plan your travel adequately, but the proliferation points are very important.

Overall, I like this game and I would play it again.  Its a really interesting twist on area majority and the travel mechanics, even though I didn't like them, are pretty unique.

This game was somewhat of a surprise- maybe because of expectations not being that high. Fun game, very easy rules, and still a  lot of strategy and planning. After a couple of plays, it really seems like diversifiation, building in a high number of cities, is necessary to do well. This is really an area control game with a lot of player interaction and interesting decisions. 

Components are good looking, with wooden houses and ships. A lot of negative comments have been made on the board graphics, but I actually like the board a lot. I do not have any problems finding the cities on the map, maybe because I am familiar with the geography of the region.

It's a Kramer design, and we could tell that right away--the tell-tale signs are there. Fast play, area control/majority game, with agonizing choices in a race to proliferate the nine cities bordering on the Mediterranean, through sailing from city-to-city and building warehouses and fortresses along the way increase income/VP. Movement/sailing is done through the purchase of expensive city destination cards and relatively inexpensive city-to-city interconnection cards. There are four destination and six interconnection cards. The Mediterranean is abstracted into a 3x3 grid, with each square representing a city where players can build warehouses and fortresses. The key is to find the most efficient and least expensive sequence(s) of cards that will get you to your desired city destination, so that you can build. Besides the limited income, additional capitalization is only available through loans, which must be paid back promptly, lest the interest accumulate. Successively increasing income/VP is doled out for having built at least one warehouse in each of the nine cities, while another warehouse track within each city indicates additional income that goes to the first and second place players who have the most warehouses in that city. The game mechanic overall is abstract, making the flow of the game quick, but the gorgeous graphics and components are quite immersive. The only quibble is that the cursive fonts makes the game hard to read, especially upside-down for some of the players. It's easy to pick up, and fast and fun to play, with moderately light strategic and tactical considerations, and some luck in the draw of the movement cards. Initial rating: '7'.

Update (02/10/13): El Capitan has fallen off the radar in recent years. I still think about it once in awhile, but compared to the latest crop of games, I'm not excited enough to pull this one off the shelf. Still a '7'.

Well, this was very strange.  It's very difficult to make any money... at best you can make $1-$2 dollars at a time.  Most transactions, you end up breaking even.  This makes it a little frustrating and it's hard to figure out exactly what you should be paying attention to. All these small pieces don't seem to add up to much of an empire and eventually everyone is everywhere anyway.  I don't know, it just wasn't my cup of tea.

To be perfectly fair, we only played the first two rounds, and with some very strange rules in Lisboa that I am not convinced were correct. (1 play)

Un juego decente y con buenos gráficos (aunque algo oscuros) de gestión de la mano, de dinero y mayorías, por debajo de El Grande con quien se le suele comparar. Los billetes de barco pueden limitar tu estrategia y el movimiento sobre el tablero porque a veces no puedes ir dónde quieres y te toca esperar marchándote a otro sitio. Resulta dificil predecir quién ganará porque suele haber bonus en la última fase de producción. Puntos fuertes: mecánica de situación de los almacenes para eliminar los contrarios situados en el puesto 1 y 2 (los más valiosos pero más frágiles). Interseante mecánica secundaria de las torres (dan más puntos si eres el que tiene la mayoría en esa ciudad). Incluye expansiones para darle más interactividad. Contras: es de barcos pero no hay mapa. Tiende a ser para cardcounters si no se juega con el público adecuado. Cómo gana el que más dinero tenga al final, tienes que gastar PV's para hacer más PV's y si te equivocas, estarás perdido

A game that I have played quite frequently the last 4 months, and no-one I introduced to this game really "hated" this game. So I'm still wondering why so few people over here seem to like this game. 
Of course as a big Mike Doyle fan I'm totally overwhelmed by the artwork, though I must confess I agree with the artist himself who said that the final version was printed a bit too dark. 
Sometimes it's hard to keep your balance in the black, especially when you get a tad unlucky with the destination cards that are still available when it's your turn. But apart from this small annoyance, the most important thing is to keep an eye on your adversaries' moves and depot placements, which can cost you the game. 
So far I have just once played with one of the "extended" cities.

RATING: 7.5
I really like the game itself. Simple rules that yield tough choices. Area control but with an economic feel, yet without the need for tons of calculation or transactions with the bank. The rule changes seem to be an improvement over Tycoon. But the overall graphic design and especially the font used for the city names make them hard to tell apart, to the point that it impedes play. I am considering putting clearer stickies on my copy's board and cards.

RATING: 8
Played once with 3 players and once with 4 (with all the expansion tiles). I am not familiar with Tycoon, but the El Capitan retheme works reasonably well here. This game essentially present players with the challenge of investing resources (principally cash) in the most efficient and effective manner. The effectiveness of these investments (building warehouses and fortresses) depends to a great extent on where the other players are building. The resulting player interaction is reasonably complex and is what makes the game interesting. My only criticism is that, with 10 sailing cards face up, players need to spend some time searching for travel permutations and then must consider these in addition to the build options available at each location, while also planning ahead and keeping track of what the other players are doing.

Pleasant surprise as I read mostly unfavourable comments on it..

Well thought and working design.  There's nothing to complain about the mechanics.  Except... it is very very typical and conventional as for territory-control game.  Nothing new and original here.
In addition the theme is so thin that it's basically skippable.

RATING: 7
While I think the new rules do improve the game (they could be used in the old version for the most part) and the game is beautifully produced, it didn't change the game enough for me to change my rating. 

I do like this game and Tycoon and I would like to try the expansion part of this to see what it adds. I pasted my Tycoon comments below...

"Not a bad influence game but no Grande to which it is often compared due to when it came out, designer, genre & scoring is similiar. Tickets can limit your strategy and movement on the board somewhat, sometimes the ticket you really need won't come up so you just have to go somewhere else while you wait. Deeper than it first appears however which makes it challenging and worth playing but it wouldn't get picked over some others and it does feel a little repetitive"

RATING: 5
Mechanically sound, and somewhat interesting area majority game. However, it's as dry as dust, the theme is completely pasted on, and the art by Mike Doyle, while colorful, is cluttered and presents some usability problems. I like how the game's economy escalates as the game goes on: After the first round you are more or less breaking even (I am, at least ;)), but after the third round you get a staggering amount of income. The game's economic engine overall feels very solid, and a lot of thought has obviously been put into balancing the various sources of income .

OK for what it is, but with games like Mykerinos and El Grande out there, I see little reason to play this very much.

This is what I said about Tycoon:

"Area control with a hint of frustration from the restrictive and randomly selected transportation cards.  I can do without this; area control is irritating enough to me that I'd prefer to be playing the very best area control games, if any at all."

The art on the new version is nice, but the game isn't any different.

RATING: 8
This was an incredibly tight game. I came in 2nd by one point. We had a tie for first. Very tight economy, good route planning, and you must run your company.

I would have won if I hadn't missed the 2nd tower being built at my last location...damn it.

A Kramer game and I still like his games (recently played Hacienda and liked that a lot as well); the ecconomy and the running of your company in this game is a balance of walking the debt line to build up income. 

This may have been my 2nd favorite game of Board Game Geek Con 2008 (at the least, it was a sleeper for me)...the session did put it high up in my mind and the fact that it would play well with 2 players alone...well, it's a good game.

And, it's pretty to boot.

A solid game with a nice balance of empire building and interaction.  The hit-the-leader component is not devastating, which will appeal to those who dislike "nasty" games.  My only complaint is that the artwork, while undeniably beautiful, makes the cards almost impossible to read from across the table.  The values are too dark, and the script too thin and flowery.

Okay area control game. I was a little disappointed with the way the game seems to really handicap those players that fall behind in placing their pieces. It seemed that once you fell behind you lost the opportunity to control the game. With the ability to only place one piece a turn it requires the people who are behind to realize who is ahead in score and and hamper them enough that the person would not want to end the game and then go after the new leader. 

I was also bummed with the graphics for the game. Now it was pretty and all but it didn't function too well. The script was tough to read and two locations had names that were similar enough that people continuously had to look at the board and cards to make sure they weren't drawing the wrong card. Nice to look at, difficult to play on.

RATING: 5
A remake of [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267/tycoon]Tycoon[/url]. Ouch, Dysfunctional artwork: dark colored art with a font that is hard to distinguish and dots resembling city positions that require you to mentally rotate cards or keep the cards upside down if you are seated at the opposite side of the board. 

On to game play. First off players that remember the cards others take will have an slight advantage. That's a memory mechanic I dislike in this game. Second the game has a rich get richer snowball effect where money makes money. Players that are behind are further slowed because they need to take loans (loss of investing action), then need to sail from the harbor (extra costs) and have to pay back the loan (extra costs) while the other players place more houses strengthening their board position.   

But those are minor complaints. My main complaint is that this game is a dry tedium of arithmetic calculations: pay X to sail to a position + Y for an investment that will pay out Z. Your job is to maximize revenues over and over and over again. Where Z will become unpredictable due to area influence of other players.

Dry and basic game. Seemed to be pretty tactical as other players could destroy your game pretty easily. I only saw one basic strategy for the game too: go everywhere and seek to get points for that.

I'm not too thrilled with the theme (I would have preferred the original, which is a little more...original) but what can you do?  Many complain about the font used for the city titles, which I can understand, but the symbols on the cards should do the trick.

I like this game. In the beginning, the lack of money makes you think about your every move really hard. So you don't have to take an extra loan to cover the costs. The pressure eases a bit as the game progresses, but you still need to be quite mindful not to spend too much in a one go. It is almost impossible to predict the winner before the last "production" phase, and that's always a bonus.

Even though the differences between Tycoon and El Capitan seem small, I greatly prefer the older version. In addition to rule changes, El Capitan also adds a fifth player to the game, but it doesn't help, as the game definitely isn't suited for more than four players.

New version of Tycoon. Looks in pictures kind of better than the original, but when played, the original Tycoon looks clearer and it's better. New a bit fixed rules aren't better than original AND the fifth player brings more downtime. The game itself still works, althought it's easier (money isn't that tight) BUT if you have a chance to get the original Tycoon, I suggest to take it. Yes, the original one looks kind of old-school and the plastic pieces are a bit hum-hum, but the game itself is great!

Very very euro with ultra abstract mechanics and weakish theme.  Gameplay is very solid however and simple enough to play with family (adults) while allowing for nice depth.  It's really a counting game with money being used to progress and as victory point at the end.  May get a bit long if people lag when deciding whether to buy cards and which to buy.  Good bridge towards real game coming from ultra casual stuff if you have a group that's not totally repulsed by complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Another plain euro board game with pasted theme.

The idea is that you move around the board to build warehouse where the player with the majority of warehouse will get points. There are various ways to score and different ways to count the majority and break ties. At the end of the round, you collect income of all cities where you have majority, plus a bonus for spreading in many cities and you pay your loans.

It's impossible to play without taking loans. It's a game where you need money to make money since you are building some sort of economic engine. But the worst part is that I think there is a serious Run Away Leader syndrome in this game. Since the more money you make, the more money you will eventually make. So if you are behind, it's just over for you.

Also, your money is your victory points. It has been proven that Victory points should be separated from money. I think it's the reason why there is a run-away leader syndrome in this game.

If you like euro games and like doing accounting, then you might like this game. Else don't rush yourself to play.

This one took me until round 3 of the first game played to really get my head around it. Not exactly what I was expecting and rather hard to describe. I'm not a big fan of the randomness factor involved with sailing. Someone can get lucky and keep getting the cheap cities they needed on the destination cards and end up saving plenty of coins just due to card draw. I'm a big fan of the dark squares system and how it removed the oldest warehouse, keeps the game interesting. I'd play it again but don't think I'd buy this one.

Beautiful game. Looks good, everything sounds ok. Unfortunately, we played the game wrong and another player abused the fact until it was too late to rectify. Looking forward to play the game the second time but correctly!

Edit: Played it the second time with 5 players. I tried to like the game, but the downtime was too long for 5-players. Also, you can't think much during downtime, as you need to wait for the other players to finish their moves first, otherwise the game becomes too chaotic. Maybe better with 4. With 5, the best strategy would be the most direct one... .

Unfortunately, I don't think that this is Mike Doyle's best work graphically. Some of the font choices are a bit off, usability-wise, and I think the saturation of the reds and blues may be a bit much.Nevertheless, I do like the look better than that of most Euros, and I have heard interesting things about Tycoon, so I'm giving real consideration to picking Capitan up at some point.

While the script of the lettering takes some getting used to, the new design is a definite improvement, and to me plays as well and balanced as it's predecessor.

Money is very tight in this game. You may begin the game thinking you won't have to take a loan to get by but this does not seem possible.

This game is a remake of Tycoon, a game that was produced in 1998. Small improvements make this version slightly more interesting then its predecessor. But its probably the artwork that makes El Capitan look a lot more like a gamers game, than Tycoon.
El Capitan is a simple economic game that keeps you in suspense till the very end. Maybe this game didn't get the credits that it deserved because, despite its great graphics, looks very static. But once you are in the game, and you know what is going on, there is a lot to consider and tension rises by the minute.

Like many have said, the graphics are a little hard to get used to. The board and cards are strictly unidirectional. Playing on the 'wrong' side of the board makes reading the cards and the cities difficult. The little grid symbols, although helpful close up, stink at a distance; they're too small to matter.

Played a single 5 player game so far and it drug like a sloth in molasses.  Painful AP. We all agreed to play with a timer next time where it costs a player some money to extend the timer.Good game but way too long for what you get out of it.

Great game.  Only twelve plays so far but very fun.  Multiple levels of decision making and ways to get income.  Towards mid-game, decision making becomes critical.  I'm beginning to grasp different clear strategies / exploitable mistakes that other players make.  The three expansions that come with the game add greatly to the replay value as well.

RATING: 8
First impression (4 players) : A bit different area majority game with interesting dynamics in how valuable areas are. In El Capitan movement is limited by cards that are bought from open display. So you have majorities, card management and your money situation to worry about. In first two rounds taking loans and how to pay them back is a question but in third it seems to be a non-issue as you gain enough money from scorings to pay them all back. I liked how the scorings work.

A surprising so-so offering from Kramer. It looks fairly good, but the game play leaves a lot to be desired. It combines fiddly mechanics in a clunky way. This game could be so much better with a few tweaks, but instead, as it is, it falls mostly flat.

An area majority game where you need to travel to different locations to build warehouses and industries in order to get points. At first, money is tight and you need to get loans, but that not only will cost you money, but time to sail to the bank. Also, your warehouses may get outdated and bounced off the track. Fairly simple, once you get the scoring system down. We all enjoyed it.

This game has some good ideas, but feels very dry.  The board art is pretty, but not very functional.  I didn't really like the card drafting mechanic, that part seemed pretty random.  The extra boards were pretty strange (and I'm not quite sure we were playing them correctly).  I'll need to play this again to get a better feel for it.

Really nice game with good mechanics. Can be a brain burner.

Takes too long with three players. Easily two hours and that's too long for a game where each turn you are (just) repeating a small set of actions. Good length with two players. Plays well with two, but there's some rule adaptations (you get extra pawns which need to get to the board as well).

I still need to try the build in expansions. Curious about the pirates! There's other cities that you can add too.

The game is an averagely interesting euro, which I would not mind playing again. But it will have to be the nearly identical earlier version of the game, Tycoon, as El Capitan is much to hard to play because of the horrible cards: neither the texts nor the sketch of the board can be recognized in a single glance. The effort you have to spend to read the cards, and you have to read 10 of them each turn, is enough to make playing this game less than enjoyable. The coins are very thematical too, and almost as unusable.

This majority game from a master designer (Kramer) features: a nicely intricate clockwork of counter-balancing mechanisms that provide multiple scoring paths, while keeping the rules relatively simple; gorgeous artwork by Mike Doyle; two cities from my home country on the expansion board. What's not to like about it? :) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like all the little gameplay improvements over the original Tycoon.  Unfortunately, the artwork suffers from a serious usability problem.  The font used for the city names is unreadable if you're one of the players sitting with a sideways or upside-down view of the cards, forcing the players to rely on the itty-bitty red dots for city recognition (the differing background and border art is too subtle to be useful for recognition).  If more thought had been put into the design of the city cards, this would be a must-buy game for me.  As is, it is simply too frustating to play.  It's a shame really, because there are dozens of easy fixes which could have been employed.  (A clearer font, a unique icon associated with each city, or city names which begin with a different letter of the alphabet so that the cities can be identified on the cards with an A, B, C, etc.)  Thumbs down to the artist.  Thumbs up to the game's designers.

This is a K&K game where you have little ships, and you buy and play movement cards to get you around the board into each of these nine towns. In the towns there are these numbered rows where you build houses. At the end of each of the three rounds, dollars are rewarded to players with the most and second most houses in each spot in an amount depending on how many houses are in the town. There are also bonuses for being at least some in each town. It played quickly, and there are some cute intricacies that at times let you unseat other player's houses. Ultimately we enjoyed the game, but the mechanic for sailing around the board didn't seem very well thought out, and for a good portion of the game it didn't seem to matter much where we chose to go and build. In terms of mechanics, it felt a little like the one part of Endeavor where you put your disks in line for the majority scoring of each area,which isn't bad, but I'd rather play Endeavor.

This is the worst game I have EVER played.  I have never rated any game a '1' before, but this game has a non-existent theme (you could replace the ports with shanties or even drive-thrus and it'll still work) and is more of an abstract game than it is area control (in my humble opinion).  My rating MIGHT change with repeat plays, but since I've decided to never play it again, I guess I'll never know.

Graphics are nice if a bit dark, making it a bit hard to read. However since you are playing on a grid it is not a detriment.  
Interesting area majority - the way the warehouses increase then get pulled in each port provide a slightly different aspect, It also includes a diminishing return as more warehouse are added.

First impression of a 2 player game. Definitively a game for three or more players. The main problem with the game is his material. The dark colors of the design and specially the design caracteres of the city names on the cards make them hard to read and this considerably slows the decision process and the game fluidity. El Capitan is still a good majority game combined with money management game. I'm anxious to try it in a four or five player game.

Update: July 2008. Played a three player game. Much better and I'm sure it's going to be even better at four.

Update: September 2008. Played a four player game. Even better. But I'm maintaining my rating because the game is to mechanical and there is not enough soul in the game for me to increase the rating. 

Première impression d'une partie à deux joueurs. Définitivement un jeu à trois joueurs et plus. Le problème principale du jeu vient du matériel. Les couleurs sont un peu trop fonçées et le design des caractères sur les cartes rendent celles-ci très difficile à lire ce qui diminue considérablement la fluidité du jeu en augmentant le temps de décision. Le jeu demeure néanmoins un bon jeu de majorité combiné a un jeu de gestion monétaire. J'ai bien hâte de l'essayer à quatre ou cinq joueurs.

Mise à jour. Juillet 2008. J'ai joué une partie à trois joueurs. Nettement meilleur qu'à deux, et il devrait être encore meilleur à quatre.

Mise à jour. Septembre 2008. J'ai joué une partie à quatre joueurs. C'est encore mieux, par contre, je n'augmente pas la note de El capitan car c'est un jeu très mécanique qui manque d'âme.

This game has complex decisions, good interaction, strategic planning, and a beautiful board.  However, while the board may be artistically impressive, it actually slows down game play and hinders the experience.  Repeated plays may increase comfort with the layout, but it was noticeably annoying to all players.  Game play was enjoyable, but a bit long and tedious for what it is.  The theme, board layout, and board artwork seemed highly disconnected.

The game has an interesting mechanic as far as building and shutting down warehouses, but the moving aspect is a pain.  You can't even read the font on the cards or the board, and you have 10 cards to choose from each turn which really slows down game play.  Money is tight and you have to take out a lot of loans which was kind of irritating to me.  

All in all a pretty big disappointment.  The game just isn't that fun at all.  I have been brain storming for a variant, otherwise it was $55 down the drain.

This is too bad, because I really, really want to like this game.

In general, a navigation theme can raise my interest. But this game, despite a Wolfgang Kramer design, is not that interesting to me. The navigation background is very thin, and this game is trully about maths. The distinguishness of different ports lie in their value, figure to be exact, which means, we are playing a game on several numbers, not harbours. I'm not that fond of (good at) maths.

After the first game, and a night to sleep on it.  I have to say that I like it.  It uses familiar mechanics to other euro style games, but has a unique feel.  Looking at it from the out side, this very much is a "pushing pieces of wood around on the board" type for those unfamiliar or dislike eurogames.  I found it an interesting challenge and hope to bring it into semi regular rotation.

One of the best Kramer games that I've tried until now.  Players are merchants getting profit in European ports building warehouses and forts.  Even when people says that the theme is pasted on, I believe it is convincing enough and allows you get in the role, more than the average Eurogame.  At the end, this game is a clever majority game.  I only have played it with the expansion, but I think that the new buildings bring unbalance to the game.

Area majority for 2-4 players, that might take a tad too long for what it offers. Seems like you're playing against the board for the early game, then you're playing against other players near the end game. Also seems like your opponents morph into cutthroat pirates from the second payday onwards. A fan of the latter part of the game, not so much the early part. The game is math-y (bad), and somewhat rewards memorization (mildly annoying). The artwork is nice, but the font on the text is hard to read quickly. I like the shut-down condition and devaluation of over-constructed ports.

3+2

El Capitan has not excited much of a stir, which is too bad really.  Although game play might seem a little pedestrian (move & build, move & build) the scoring system and the cleverly balanced game architecture make for an engaging experience.  Another plus:  Very, very good two-player rules.  And don't forget to place me firmly in the pro-Doyle camp.

I bought this game at WBC based on recommendations from BGG.  After a few plays, I am glad I bought this game.  I enjoy investment games and economic themes - this game is great for those.  The only semi-frustrating part is the font used for the cities - being a cursive font it's a little tough to read, but other than that a great game.

I love Tycoon, and as this is pretty much a direct port of the game, I feel that this version is far weaker.

While the art is beautiful, I feel that it interferes with the playability to such an extent that I have to give this a 7 rather than the 8.5 Tycoon gets.

So what is wrong? 

The script is difficult to read, so much so that when you are reading from across the table and finally figure out what you are looking at you can still realize that, no, you wanted Tangier not Tunisia or Valencia rather than Venicia. 

Yes, there are dots on the cards to help you out, but they are dark orange on dark brown.  Everything is way too dark, it is hard to distinguish what is going on at a glance.  The spaces that blow up the old hotels should be clearer.  

Much of my problems with it could have been solved by the use of some white.  Really, there is a reason why people use white.

A larger bold font, in white, would have cleared things up considerably.  That and icons rather than the occasional use of flags.

Now this is a minor gripe, but the art in the boxes has hints of a map.  Why didn't this just get put on a map?  It would have made this much more appealing and felt less abstract.

I'm sticking with my old cheesy version.

A great remake of Tycoon with some improved rules that makes for fast, engaging play. Would clock this one in at 90 minutes with some experience. Essentially a card drafting, area control, optimization game with a pasted on theme but it works. We did have some trouble reading the new cards which is a symptom of Mike Doyle's artwork and design sesibility. He is an absolutely incredible graphic designer and illustrator, but has a bit to learn about information design. Ultimately while gorgeous, the board is a bit too busy and suffers from a dark palette and over designed elements. That said, I had a blast playing the game and look forward to playing the enclosed expansions. Also thought the new rules worked well.

I really want to like this game, as it has the challenges of figuring out how to build routes from point A to point B as well as a really interesting economic/area control element for how you get paid out in the various cities. However, it just takes way too long for what it is. There many quality shorter area control or economic games out there as well as route building ones that this one just seems to be so-so.

A nice upgrade from Tycoon (with it's ridiculously big box -- traded away!) that includes some interesting variants. The pirate city, however, seems pretty annoying -- likely won't play with it again. The game is pretty, and while the text is hard to read I didn't think it was a significant problem since there are graphical representations of the islands on the cards as well.

This is very beautiful game. The components are excelent although the names on the cities could be larger. The flow of play is very good. It could be played in 90 minutes for sure and it doesn't have downtime. I guess that the hot spot should be with 4 players.I think that the closing of the warehouses is a very tense and inteligent mechanism and makes this game much more interesting than I thought. I only think that it isn't very balanced in terms of money stress when coming from turns #1 and #2 to turn #3. Which means that we don't have money in turns #1 and #2 and lots of it to spend in turn #3.

Beautiful remake of Tycoon, with some good rule tweaks (like having more starting money and not being allowed to start the game with a loan).

Clever an "area control" game insofar as players' abilities to buy [-]stocks[/-]warehouses in the abstract [-]companies[/-]cities also has a spatial movement element. Each purchased warehouse changes the payout of the city, which is distributed 100%/50% to first and second place; each city also has two fortress spaces, which pay out 50%, or 100% if the city has the most warehouses. Movement is by cards showing movement directly between two cities or, more expensive, from any location to a particular city.

It works very well, and the bonus for warehouses in all 9 locations skews the incentives enough that it becomes quite involving.

As expected, Mike Doyle's artwork is very attractive, even as it errs on the side of form over function.

I admit it - I owned Tycoon at one time but sold it. Not because of the gameplay but because of the huge box and the uninspired artwork. The combined lack of storage space and an appreciation for presentation made Tycoon pretty easy to unload.

This new edition is now smaller and quite handsome. I don't find the usability issues significant (though they are present). I question the use of thin, gold script on the board and cards, but it's not even close to a deal breaker.

Yes a solid 8 from me. It seems to have a relatively low score because of the board, but whether it is because i have the German printing, we found no problems with this, even from the player upside down to the writing.
If this is the case, then that is truly a great shame, because we found the gameplay very good, and unclear who was winning which is a bonus.
Time flew by, but there were only 3 of us playing relatively quickly, but with 4 one of whom is slow, this could annoy from an AP angle, as there is some calculation towards the end.

RATING: 7
An improvement over Tycoon, its predecessor. Can be a bit of a calculation-fest with the wrong crowd, but also can move along quickly with those willing to forego optimizing every placement. The graphics and especially the fonts for the locations on the cards could have been far better in terms of readability and practicality, but the overall effect is nice. The play balance really seems improved in this new iteration of the game ... a very nice reimplementation with improvements at every turn, from theme to rules.

First Impression:

Another area control euro with a paste-on theme.

A big plus for me is that you are discouraged to bash another player, even if he's clearly leading the game. How exposed and prone to losing ground a player is, depends only on his actions. In addition, as all area control games, this too has decent player interaction.

The game is bland, repetitive and takes too much time for what it offers. 

I wasn't impressed be el Capitan. It has some strong design points, but it didn't keep me interested.

Stress and tension are pushed to the max in this game. I love those games that get you all stirred up inside when you are playing them and El Capitan is one of those games.

I've never played Tycoon so I don't know how it compares but throwing in the added Pirate guy is nasty nasty nasty! A great game!

[thing=29972][/thing] is an area control game  with management of money and travel routes. During the game, players try to have more influence in the commerce in several cities and expand their business in order to grab some juice bonus money; they will build warehouses, in order to gain money, while also trying to make a lean route with their ships, in order to best seek opportunities and don't lose the timming of placing a house somewhere. Since travel expends money, and the person with the most money will win, is important to expend well.

[thing=29972][/thing] is a smart game, but also somewhat mean - warehouses keep being deactivated, and although is free to open it again, many times the player must spend time and money to do this, losing also the opportunity to open a new warehouse or making a fortress (which also nets the player money). Furthermore, [thing=29972][/thing] is rather dry - there isn't truly a feel of navigation or trade; pick and deliver often works very well in passing a sense of commerce and trade between places, but [thing=29972][/thing] lacks this, going just for the area control and movement.

[thing=29972][/thing] has some surprises with the travel cards, but once the players have a good amount of money (around the third round), while is still relevant to save money, the need to build beforehand routes isn't completely there anymore, as the big tickets, which normally cost more, can do the trick, and sometimes they don't even cost more.

Yet, in spite of its flaws, [thing=29972][/thing] is clever enough to allow for a tight and exciting game, with lots of planning and timming involved. Moving to the right place in order to take a majority, making your fortress worth more and hitting someone else at the same time, can be very satisfying. The look of the game - with darker tones and not all that inspired and inviting - can lead people away from it, but [thing=29972][/thing] has enough strong points to be worth at least a try.

While I was originally turned off by the loan-centric core of the game, once I realized that the math works out as long as you're doing what the game asks of you I had a whole lot more fun exploring the design.

Figuring out the timing of when to keep pushing forward establishing trade offices and when to take the tempo hit to return home and grab more loans, all while struggling against the actions of the other players is a delicious quandary. Add to this the automatic decommissioning of trade houses and the eventual decline in revenue as more get added and you have fantastic, interactive puzzle with lots of tough decisions and sharp money management.

While rather dry, it's an easy recommend for those looking for a sort of euro/economic blend with more interactivity than is initially apparent.

Well, it's another Euro, with all the stupid mistakes that Euros make.  Oh, is there a theme here?  Let's eliminate any hint of it.  Map?  Nah, let's abstract it to a bunch of boxes.  Oh, and let's use numbers.  Lots of numbers!  Gamers love math.  And, let's also make sure that it's about... trading in the Mediterranean.  Can't go wrong there!  At least the game uses money instead of victory points, and this is money you can actually spend and use, in an effort to get more money later.  The game itself is interesting, I suppose, if you're into that kind of thing.  And here, 'that kind of thing' is boring-ass numerical puzzles of the type you've seen a million times before.  

Finally, it must be mentioned that the graphic design is terrible.  Mike Doyle has come up with, again, a design that is lush, rich, and completely non-functional.  The cover is practically the same as [gameid=34615] and [gameid=28723], as if to scream HEY GUYS THIS IS ABOUT OLD TYME-Y SHIPPING!  Whee!  Then, the worst factor is that the cards are almost unusable.  The script is illegible, a point which [url=http://mdoyle.blogspot.com/2009/04/supplemental-notes-on-functions-of.html]Doyle himself concedes[/url].  The solution?  Use a diagram which is supposed to represent the position on the map.  However, let's make this diagram as small as possible, reduce it to nine dots, and finally make it impossible to decipher from the other end of the table.  Um, what?

Played once, and although there are some good ideas here I wasn't too pleased with the experience. I felt that movement and building were two disjoint mechanics, and would have preferred if the movement were simplified so that it didn't get in the way or worse supercede the incentive patterns at work in the building mechanic. Oh well, I guess I'd play again, but like Brass I feel this has too much peripheral clutter for its own good.

The first play of this one made me think that it was a game for accountants and financial controllers, not gamers.  However, additional plays have really opened this one up to me; it feels a bit like thurns and taxis with money management and cool ship drawings.  Planning sailing routes when the right cards appear, all while keeping funds in mind makes in more challenging than T&T, consequently more fun, at least to me.  It definitely plays better than T&T with 2 players, in fact I think it works great with two.

A re-implementation of Tycoon with a new design.  The movement in El Capitan remains the same and is dictated by the destination and connection cards made available to you at the start of each turn.  To me the key to the game is to minimize the traveling you have to do, especially backtracking and trips to the bank to borrow money.  You want to be able to use up all of the building resources as much as possible before scoring takes place.  While diversifying is good (i.e. having a presence in each of the 9 cities), it is vastly more important to have first place control in 2-3 locations as well as establishing fortresses in them to double your income.  My only concern with the game is how long it plays, and one seems to be repeating the same choices over and over again.  I don't dislike it, but I don't see myself playing it very often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent but not rocking my world.  Pay money for movement cards, use said cards to move around a nine-city grid.  Pay money to build warehouses in those grids.  Perform area control scoring three times during the game, most points wins.

It's really a less-interesting El Grande analog.  El Capitan doesn't suck but I'll pick El Grande every time.

The artwork is beautiful. The game play isn't bad either. :)

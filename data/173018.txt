The art sucked me in on this game, and I haven't allowed myself to make a game purchase based on art alone in a while. 

We've played several rounds of the duel mode. This is probably the closest I will get to MtG/Ashes-style two-player duel games, which tend to be both too complex and too fiddly for my taste.Grimslingers is both complex and fiddly, and that makes the duel mode a dud for me -- on its own, I'd rate the duel mode afour or a five.

Fortunately, the story mode exists. 

The story mode is great, for two reasons: first of all, duh, there's a story! And it's a good one, and the weird west world is all there, and it's engaging and interesting. So that's great. But secondly, the story mode is cooperative, and suddenly the weird compromises in duel mode melt away and you play the game as it was designed to be played. Instead of stumbling over each other, you're all pooling your power to take down terrifying beasts.

Grimslingers is one of my favorite co-ops -- really, this game is just so, so good. It has that exploration sense a little, though I would like to see that improve in the expansion (the base game feels more like a struggle for survival than a sandboxy exploration game). Really, this is just a chance to dive into the incredibly compelling world that the designers have painted. Could see this one going to a 9 or a 10 as I finish out the base-game story and try the expansion.

It's an elaborate card version of rock/paper/scissors. There's some interesting narrative and mechanical shenanigans going on, but it just felt a bit too light for what it's trying to do. I really want to give the campaign mode a shot though.

The co-op mode of this game is really fun. I'm not as interested in the duel/pvp mode...i've got a zillion games already that involve whacking people w/magic. I do wish the designer had spent a little more time on the rulebook...the errata list is ridiculously long & the book itself is pretty vague in places.

One of the most gorgeous board games you can see... but playing it's very hard! Poor rulebook, lots of exceptions, no reference cards and lots of mistakes. But when you overpass that and try to start the campaign, the game has interesting things. Narrative is not as exciting as I expected, but mechanics seem to be cool, but maybe too random as well. I've tried it solo, and also with 4 players, and it's more funny with more than one people playing. It's interesting in some ways but players must do a big effort to play it, and that's annoying.

January 2018 arrival with expansion?

Duel is meh. Well made, just not entirely my bag. I hope the co-op adventure is better. 
Excellent art, and the 3rd edition rules are available online. This is the ruleset to use.

Fourth Edition rules with Northern Territory expansion. 

After a solo campaign session, here's where I'm at ...

... Art and Atmosphere are excellent. Pacing is great. Difficulty level seems about right (should be less nasty with some help from another player). Some kinks in the rules here and there, but the designer is available to help with questions. 

The game takes up a lot of space, and all the card manipulation takes up a lot of time. Another player or two would really help move things along in this area. I'd rather spend my time making decisions and battling instead of combining decks and shuffling so often. Pain in the ass. 

Gotta pick up where I left off in THE VALLEY OF DEATH. ????

RATING: 5
(3rd edition)

Extremely shoddy rule-book. The designer really needs to properly explain how the game should be played. Oh and good luck tracking down corrections and rulebooks with three editions everything is mixed up and searches can readily result in strange answers because the three editions (!) are only slightly different from each other apparently, but those differences are not tracked well at all. There is a hideous lack of clarity in the rules. 

VS mode should be avoided. AT. ALL. COSTS.

The story mode is a mess of tone and cannot decide if it's some laugh a minute romp or dark and gritty weird west game. The humor, while cute at times, gets tiresome very fast. Apparently, there are some nerfs in the third edition that have made the game just crazy hard for characters (1 action during stand-off I'm looking at you). This seems to be because the designer thinks this is a PVP game. Stay away from the PVP it's glorified and kludgey rock-paper-scissors.

A shame, this game has a nugget of fun in the fighting of monsters. There is some possibility of a good game, but the mess of tone and the garbage rules dramatically reduce any interest in this game.

I've played the introductory duel twice and I like how the simple 2 cycles of rock-scissors-paper elemental spells interact with the choices you make during the game. Great artwork that fits the theme and looks like there is plenty of ways to extend the game with the additional mechanics that can be added in.

The coop version is interesting, we've just started it recently.

A very underwhelming game. The beautiful art and amazing theme are the saving factors for this game. I didn't feel any challenge while playing the game. All the spells and items feel bland. The Tall Tales are a cool concept but become repetitive very quick.

This is not a bad game, but one just didn't do anything for me. Maybe I'm missing some rules that make the game more interesting because the rule book is pretty poor and leaves a lot of questions unanswered.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok, let me say something: This game has maybe the best art I ever saw in a boardgame (and I own 200+ boardgames). Not only in games, but in any media, be it comics or illustrations. Also, the setting is cool and feels unique. Stephen Gibson is an absolutely fantastic illustrator and world builder, easily in line with the biggest names in the industry. The art alone was the reason for me to buy this game, something I never do. I have to repeat: The art and setting is uberfantastic, mindboggingly good! I have fallen in love with every dot of color of it!

That being said...the game. Well, you know those comics that were drawn and written by one and the same person? (in contrary to a writer and an artist). They usually lack in either the writing or the art, and this here is the perfect analogy. While there has been clearly a lot of love and effort into making it, the game is really not good. It's basically rock-paper-scissors with so many elements, it becomes completely chaotic and overloaded. Wait. Rock-Paper-Scissors is already random. So how is it overloaded and even more random? No fun. Even worse: The rules for this chaotic rock-paper-scissors are fiddly, convoluted and not elegant.  (Note: I only played 4-Players duels, but the game mechanics are not interesting enough for me to play the solo campaign)

So, what can I say. I would love to have Mr. Gibson work with a game designer who spent as much time designing fantastic gamest as he did becoming a fantastic artist. Or have Fantasy Flight, Wizards of the Coast, CMON, etc. give this guy big bucks to make art for their games. It's uberfantastic! This game itself? Not so much. I strongly recommend trying it out before buying it!

Egyelőre csak a duel módot próbáltuk, ami kifejezetten fun, party jellegű adok-kapok, legalábbis kettesben. A kivitelezés szemet kápráztató. A játékmenettől féltem, mert ez a kő-papír-olló + black jack szisztéma nem hangzott túl jól. Ennek ellenére meglepően jól működött. Aki komolyabb kontrollt igényel, az azért inkább kerülje el, de aki el tudja fogadni, hogy egy 20 perces játékban fontosabb az élmény, mint a győzelem, annak mindenképp ajánlott, különösen, ha bejön neki ez a scifi-western téma.
A koop részt is szeretném még mindenképp kipróbálni, és utána frissíteni a véleményt. :)

Coup de coeur. Dans une sorte d'Ouest à la Deadlands mais avec de la technologie (comme dans Trigun), des traîne-savates se sont vus refiler des pouvoirs par le Sorcier du Fer. Il leur a aussi collé un pda intelligent qui leur file de l'énergie pour alimenter leurs pouvoirs. On se fritte à coups de sorts avec des cartes et la mécanique est bien rôdée (c'est la v3, en même temps). Deux modes dans la boîte :
- le versus, où on se fritte en mode "règlements de comptes à OK Corral"
- le solo/coop, où on suit un mode narratif.
Le jeu est super beau et franchement bon.

A game that is very easy to teach (managed to do so while hammered, in fact.) but very difficult to master, with the most simple level of play being fun for small groups, and the more advanced mechanics giving the game intense replay-ability.
The co-op mode is also beautifully made, with a reasonably interesting story and some great mechanics, though the dice included with the game is a bit shit, and I seem to always roll 6's.

Supernatural western setting with beautiful artwork that has both a competitive and co-operative setting. However, the manual is dense, the example of play isn't as easy to gain information from, and it ends up you are looking at BGG to find a video on how to play... that delays play in such a way that everyone wants to try something else.

Cool art, perfect topic for me and the most important part: game mechanic - seems unique, especially the way of having base cards for all players mixed with combining unique spells. This brings light deck customization inside, like in deck building or tcg games, which is very cool. Also I see so much different concepts: the different characters, the minigame, the simultanous play, the unique spells choosing. Also the art is absolutely stunning!!!

The blackjack part is quite tense and you don't want to push too hard because you might take more damage. Overall a fun little duel game that I want to play with 2vs2 in the near future.

SOLO KEEPER
This game gets flak for having a simple resolve-duel mechanic. But I like it because it makes skilful use of cards, a character with different attributes which exhaust and a small but effective map of locations. Alongside the rules booklet is a story booklet which provides flavour and a campaign feel. For what is just a card game it is fantastically original and the gonzoid artwork - cowboys meets dinosaur steampunk sci-fi fantasy - makes it a neat solo game in a small box. Great value for money for what is an RPG-lite with none of the overhead. Grimslingers reminds me of Darkest Night and Pathfinder: Adventure Card Game without being like either. This is a game to which designer Steve Gibson has devoted a huge amount of passion and it shows.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  This is arguably the coolest game I've ever owned and played.  The theme, the setting, the artwork all ooze awesomeness.  But dang, I just couldn't get over the rules hump with this one.  I felt like the game was fighting against my own instinct of how it should be played.  The solo game involves a campaign style story arc where you travel around collecting various items and fighting enemies.  All of the pieces for greatness are there in the box.  I just couldn't put them together for my own enjoyment.  I'd still recommend soloists give this a shot as it does have a lot going for it.

Which is sad because man...it's beautiful.

As a two player games it's good but Battlecon is similar but far better - as a free for all, it's way too random and as a team vs team - it's only okay as the cards ONLY interact if you happen to be both shooting other so a lot the core double think mechanic is removed.

Kickstarted basegame and expansion April 2, 2017.  Taking a risk, but I'm up for anything solitaire nowadays and I love the theme/artwork and I want to support this guy and his labor of love.

I've tried to play this one a few times. it's a bit complicated and the rules aren't very clear. But the artwork is fantastic.

Hello !!
Impossible de commencer à parler de Grimslingers sans évoquer les illustrations qui sont tout simplement à se rouler par terre. Que ce soit les personnages, les Anima, les monstres, les objets, les cartes Sortilèges… C'est juste superbe !!
Le jeu en lui même est assez simple, rapide et on est très vite plongé dans cet univers particulier mêlant western, magie, robot.
Une fois qu'on a compris les règles de base, ne reste plus qu'à ajouter les "extensions" prévues, à savoir de nouvelles cartes Sortilèges, des Objets, des caractéristiques à attacher à son personnage… Bref il y a de quoi faire. Surtout que Grimslingers propose un mode de jeu narratif à jouer en Coop ou Solo.
Du tout bon pour ce jeu qui mérite qu'on s'y attarde. : )

RATING: 8.2
The campaign is quite enjoyable and the art is out of this world.  The game can be a little fiddly at times and there is an excessive use of abbreviations and terminology that isn't needed, but once you get the hang of the flow of the game it is a lot of fun in co-op.  It is a great campaign game, I can't speak to the duel aspect however.

I was intially attracted to this game because of the beautiful artwork and the possible cooperative "campaign".  I have only played one example duel with basic rules to get a feel for the game, and I suspect there is a learning curve before we will be ready to tackle the map.

The cooperative mod is where the game really shines. It offers a very special feeling of that post-apocalyptic-western-fantasy. It is really cool, even though most of your choises during a fight are pretty obvious. (I've always played it with 2 players)

Amazing world. Fantastic writing and art. Presentation is wonderful. Richly immersive, which will cover most of it's faults for those willing to put in the extra effort. Super cool ideas. Some cool mechanics. So many rough edges.

Ambiguous and confusing rules, but admittedly filled with exceptions and options and difficult to teach properly. Lack of player aids. A duel mode that requires house rules and player preference to make it replayable, otherwise very static.

Coop mode is the jewel because it weaves a quirky story, but very little actual "coop" or collaboration. My card play does not affect your card play, etc. Basically, fight one of 6 monsters with increasingly predictable AI, move a little on the map, then read a new page in the storyline. Look forward to someday completing the story because it's awesome, but I wish the basic system was more robust.

Very enjoyable, very beautiful game. The character, anima, and enemy cards just make me cry tears of joy (especially the nod to Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls). I love the fact that I can choose competitive duels or coop campaign style play.

The competitive duels are okay, but not my favorite. The Advanced Duel seems necessary to add a bit of variety. The Story heavy Co-op game is great, though. It was the main reason I bought it, and it doesn't disappoint. While replayability may be an issue down the line, the upcoming expansion will surely take care of that.

The art and world this game creates are just stellar.  

The game is interesting and easy to get to the table.  Rating may go up if it continues to hit the table easily.

Silly is the best way to describe this. The coop is a silly story with a meat circus of an ending. The duels are a silly, semi-broken affair where you play a lot of blackjack and laugh at the results. Rough edges, oversights, and bizarre balance issues abound in this box, and yet there's something undeniably fun about the whole affair.

This game is packed with a ridiculous amount of content, all of which is beautifully illustrated with Stephen Gibson's unique style. The rulebook on the first edition can be a bit tough, but the creator has put out some awesome how to play videos on youtube. https://youtu.be/kdl3xJTB-HI. They're also making a full revision of the rules free to download in an upcoming KS campaign ( March 9th, 2017). 

All things said, this game is just pure cool, and at that price point I think its impossible to pass up.

The contents page in the rulebook doesn't show which cards are which. I've pulled this game out twice thinking about learning it and I've not got past the contents page...I fianlly pulled this out when I had some energy for it and I'm glad I did, it's an interesting game with awesome art. I look forward to trying the cooperative campaign game out, it looks like it'll be fun.

One of Compass Games best productions - lots of great Chrome and some decent alternative history options to give the Germans more bite than histrocially. Let down by lack of one map options for the space challeneged.

Some of the snarks over this game reflect an evident anti-Raicer bias.  It is his rulebooks that give me fits, not the designs, by and large, with the evident exception of his howler, The First World War.

Played one partial game, a lot of it does seem clever, but it also gave the impression of being not a lot of game in a lot of space with a lot of units. The Russians tear the Germans apart in the south and then practice their driving and traffic management skills. It does feel a little over-designed with all the different movement phases, including an "Administrative" movement phase which is really often just another breakthrough phase as the German defenses evaporate. The game still interests me but I'm not sure if it's worth the time and effort, given what seemed like relatively few interesting decisions. Still have interest in Storming the Reich, though, which is presumably lower density and a somewhat more interesting situation.

Ted Racier has done some great games with many clever bits, but his traditional weakness is game length ... there are many, many of his games that are just too long for what you get out of it (notable previous offenders are Reds!, RTC, and Grand Illusion). Red Storm Over the Reich looks like it might fall into this category as well. But it also looks interesting to play. I'm looking forward to giving it a try despite the qualms about how long it'll take.

Compass publish another game with excellent (by wargame standards) components. This period of the war receives far less attention than the opening of Operation Barbarossa, yet it feels very similar, as an outclassed opponent trades men and space to defend. Of course, here there is no prospect of the juggernaut stopping.

Ted Raicer has used an unusual system in his design, somewhat reminiscent of some of his earlier designs (the variable movement in the Clash of Giants games). The turn sequence is involved, with units able to move before they fight (and the phasing player must decide how far they can move), and the non-phasing player able to react before the phasing player exploits. A new player therefore has to learn to play the system before they can effectively play the game.

The victory conditions are set such that this is no walkover for the Red Army, but the Wehrmacht will have to work hard to defend successfully as it cobbles together defensive lines from the remnants of its armies.

1. Design - raw but useful and clear.
2. Mechanics - very interresting movement and combat segments builds a climatic view of last days of Third Reich.
3. Play - 8-10 hours of play, very emotional and full of tension. BUT here is a big problem. Designer have lots of faults about OdB. In my research thy did lose ca. 8-10 German divisions. You not find them in game but find it in lots of historical sources. It's a lot problem? I think it is. In that case I give 6 to RSOTR

Great graphics and a creative and interesting sequence of play.  The low grade was more an issue that the game is very dependent upon rolling average die rolls for movement.   If the Russians move a lot and the Germans don't, game over.  You must defend the victory hexes as the Germans as that funnels the Russian attack.  I enjoyed playing the German and trying to put together a defense after being shredded each turn.  You get 4 movement phases per turn but only 1 combat and 1 overrun phase, which makes break outs critical for the Russia.  I won the first game as German while the Russian tried to figure out how to use the turn sequence, then I got crushed badly as the German, the Russian learned the lessons and I didn't change my tactics.  But a fun game and well thought out.  I think if you use the Guderian Scenario it would make for a lot more fun.  The game as is teaches you how ugly the situation was for the Germans.  Rules were laid out very well also.

RATING: 9
"Red Storm Over the Reich" is an excellent simulation of the final months on the Eastern Front in 1945.  It demonstrates well the strategic drives of the Soviets and the desperate defense and counterattacks by the Germans.  A reading of "Red Storm on the Reich" by Christopher Duffy reveals Ted Racier covered all the key points in this game, e.g., the destruction of the initial German defense on the Vistula, the large Soviet breakthroughs and race to the Oder and Baltic, the tough German defense of East Prussia and the German fortress cities, the German Army and Navy trying to save refugees, Soviet logistic problems, and the isolation and final assault of Berlin.  From this game you can then go down in scale to Moments in History's "Gotterdammerung" and ATO's "Fortress Berlin" to view more detailed aspects of the final destruction of the German army on the Eastern Front in 1945.

When I bought this game, because of the late stage of the war in Europe, I thought that the Soviets would run rough-shod over the Germans. Not so.  The Germans always won even with the relatively weak units that they had.  The Soviets should have been a lot stronger than they were.  I usually love long lasting games but I feel that this one lasted a bit too long for what it was hoping to do.  The Sequence of Play was different than most games which I do think was quite interesting.

RATING: 8
Very good: Operational - WW II, Eastern Front - Medium

Plus:
-Great innovative design from an even greater designer.Ted Raicer is no longer the WW I Master Designer but has over time established to great overall designer.
The variable movenments each turn guarantees great surprises each turn. Where other designres use chit pull, here the dice will decide the movement capacitiy for both Russian and German units.
-Superb components (like Bitter End)
-Excellent theme (I can suggest reading 'Last Battles on the Eastern Front' and the Heinz Guderian biografie).
This, together with Bitter End are the ultimate games for the last battles on the Eastern Front. Actually this is one of my most favorite topics 

Minus:
-Definately missing historical notes. Especially since this is a part of WW II gaming that is hardly been recognized in boradgames and has so many interesting aspects. For the scope and process heavey procedures it would have been appropriate to write historical comments / design notes to place them into the context.
-Quite process heavy, needs some plays to get everything in the right order. Normally this is fine as it makes the game what it is but the replay value might become an issue.

It takes a few rounds to get everything right but it is very rewarding. I very much like the variable movemnet for infantry and mechanised units. A die role will determine their range as well as the reaction movent capability for the Germans!
You also will have to determine how many movement points you expand during the movenment phase. The more you spent, the less you have during brakthrough. Also the combat duration will absorb your movenment capability and this s a great innovation.
This game is certainly not for all but for wargamers with an interest in the Eastern Front this is a must have. A fantastic production from Compass Games by a fantastic designer on a fantastic topic. Well done!

See review.

Final Soviet closing assault on the Germany homeland.  High quality physical components are expected but the price is on the high end too (cost about the same as Valor of the Guard).  Storming the Reich is on the horizon in Nov 2010.  If I buy that game, I might consider this as complete collection of the two sister games by the same designer Ted Racier. Now, where is the Hitler Jurgen?

The map is awesome!  But I wish they would have put on the names of the many major and minor rivers for historical interest.  Now, what would that river call?  In the beginning most of the German units deploy along the river in contacts with the Soviet monsters.  

The game itself is quite procedures-heavy.  On the other hand, while there are 3 movement phases on each side (not even counting the reaction movement), the combat system is an unexpectedly simple one.  There are a lot of operational decisions on both sides.  Many intense moments throughout the whole game (there are 8 turns in total), even after the Soviet make the breakthrough on the frontline.  To the German player, it is really a test of skill to defend and redeploy, time and again, to the defensive terrains like defensive works, forest, broken and mountain.  The decision is tough and mind-boggling.  Despite it is a two-maps game and takes some time to complete it, I really like this game because it is a great simulation of the campaign.

Definitely one of the better games on the destruction of Army Group Center and the attack into Germany by the Russians in 1944-45.  Beautiful map and components, but there are a few things that gamers need to get used to in this game such as the rules on multi-hex attacks, four movement phases, etc., which means that your first play or two of this might not come out right!  It does a good job of showing how the Germans continued to put forces back into the field and the problems the Russians faced during their rapid advance.

Somebody thinks Red Star Rising was short and completed the timeline with RSoR. It covers from the Soviet winter offensive of 1944 until the fall of the Reich. Now the Soviets will attack with complete Corps against weak and retreating German Divisions. The end of war is clear and the Germans must resist the best they can, because, for them, Reds are worst than the rest of Allies.

Tentative rating after having played twice the historical scenario:

The map is very beautiful: I really like the brown shades for the terrain. The counters are nothing exceptional, but they are clear and functional!

The rulebook is well done and a complete example of play helps integrating the rules.

One just need to be careful when unfolding the map: I tore it a bit by being not cautious enough! 

Concerning play: Having good command dice rolls is paramount here, especially for the Assault segment! I'd much prefer rolling high there and having poor Assault DR than the opposite! This said, unless the Soviet player rolls very poorly, he is going to slaughter the Germans south of Warsaw... and he must do so, because there are a lot of German reinforcements on turn three! 

Contrarily to some players, I do not find the game sequence too "complicated": Three movement phases seem necessary to simulate history, IMHO!

Update after a third play - yet not to the end, unfortunately:

This game is no picnic for the Soviet player:

He must be very careful to prevent encircled German units from cutting his supply lines and he must always keep the victory conditions in mind to decide where to move and attack: Berlin won't be easily conquered, unless the German player regularly rolls low on Command DR and is unable to manoeuvre!

On this matter, it is a little bit annoying that so much depends on so few dice rolls!

This aside, I believe this is a great design that allows an interesting and challenging play for both sides and it's no small feat!

If you are tired of being pushed east as the Russian player, here's your chance to push back west!

Production value of the components is very high as the rules, maps, and counters are well done.  In addition are several playaids that lend a helping hand - setup cards and an Expanded Sequence of Play card that vastly trims the time needed to flip back through the rule book.

Gameplay seems repetetive at first due to the several movement phases within a turn, but you'll quickly see that it both moves steadily and is vital to the gameplay (movement is variable and factors highly in combat as the Russians can't initiate combat, move in the breakthrough phase or use artillery if they use their full movement allowance).  Combat is fire based, not odds based, with attrition based results (no retreating here for the most part!) and gives both sides an ample opportunity to inflict losses.  Overall chrome is low, but what's there makes an nice impact - the German Panzerfaust rule when fighting in built-up areas, German refugees clogging up German movement, a Zhukov counter to give the Russians an extra push, and the bombing of Dresden cutting into Germany's rail capacity for example.  All done with little rules or just a counter with a rules reference on the back.

Rating "disclaimer" - I helped playtest this game.

Seems a bit long for what it wants to show, yet it is not easy to win as the Soviet player. Again some cool Ted Raicer ideas in this one, though you easily spot the descent from Command´s games about the same period. Is it better than Smithereens from XTR (which I personally like a lot despite its criticism)? I think not, but it is certainly in the same league.

Bought it out of a desire to own at least one LARGE game and than found my first problem was to find room for this map.

Takes quite some time to set up but I managed and enjoyed it. Than it came time to play and - maybe also cause I played solo and had to figure out actions for both sides- that was not too easy.

Only played a few turns solo, needed the table for something else and I had by than made some crucial mistakes with the rules, so didn't mind having to end it.
As a solo game it is very difficult to keep track of things.

But I enjoyed it. I'm not unfamiliar with the history, but this map really gave me a an idea where what was i.e. the situation.
It has made me come to the conclusion that we read history books WRONG. You should actually go and get a map of the area and look up the places mentioned to get a better idea of what is happening..

Especially bought a book on the subject as a fellow geek suggested to read that to get you really in the mood for the game. "THE FALL OF BERLIN"

Great game on a very interesting period of Ww2 on EStern Front. Nice components and good gameplay. Two sides have different aims and capabilities. Some interesting 'chrome' without bogging the game down. Lots of opportunities for manoeuvre in the innovative turn sequence. Nice to see an East Front game that has Soviets in the ascendancy right from the start

RATING: 7
A well done game on a subject that there have not been many games on. It plays well solitaire and for two players I believe would be worthwhile. The German play will have to play chess like in his moves to stop the Soviet tide. The victory conditions are hard on the Soviets so the German player won't be helpless. It is a big game, I would call it a mini monster. One of Ted's better games. The componates are excellent. I liked the game so much I preordered Storming the Reich, it's westfront version.

Rating is based on one face to face game that was not finished.Positives: components are beautiful especially the map. I liked the variable movement and fire-based crt as well as some of the chrome rules such as German refugees, limited German fuel supply,the Zhukov counter, and dwindling Soviet logisitcs capability that add a nice "Eastern Front"touch.
 My only complaint was the redundant and to me overly-engineered sequence of play.Everything that wargamers love about the East Front-- encircling attacks aimed at an opponent's supply line,counterattacks from German Panzers, ponderous but potentially overwhelming Soviet riflemen--are all present in this design, but you have to wade through 28 seperate steps to get there. Checking the supply status of all units three times a turn and rolling for the movement capability of both sides'units three times each turn really slowed the game for me. Just when I became excited about my upcoming attack plan, or anxious to see what my opponent was about to do, it seemed we had to stop and either roll a die or trace supply. 
A simpler, modified move-combat-exploitation type sequence of play would have greatly sped up  gameflow and would have probably given us the same or similar results as our game.

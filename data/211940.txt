Never would prefer a game of this over hanabi.
Good for a few plays, 
but heavily pacing dependent 
and screwing up feels much more like you should have seen that coming.

RATING: 5
Cool concept, but the game is too easy (even with the ability to change the difficulty).  I think the engine is more clever than "The Game" as these games are similar, but its just not a keeper due to the difficultly.

RATING: 3
This just rang hollow with me. It seemed that unless you are mapping out the end game by more than halfway through, it is extremely unlikely to come away with a win. The importance of card order is just too apparent and not hidden from the players. We knew with two rounds left that winning was not possible.

Move over Hanabi, Okey Dokey has stolen your crown. Okey Dokey takes one of my favorite card game mechanics, the ascending placement of cards (a la Lost Cities, Arboretum, etc) an applies it to a cooperative/solitaire game. While the ascending card placement drew me in, its the Reset cards make Okey Dokey great. Since each row must be Reset twice, but only once in each column, the game gives players control of the draw pile. Selecting which player should place the Reset, and selecting which cards to discard gives players a lot of flexibility. The Reset cards are less interesting in the solitaire game, but give the player enough control for Okey Dokey to supplant Klondike as the go-to solitaire game.

RATING: 6
Solved after two plays (solo, hardest setting). Always discard your 7s & 8s (and maybe other unplayable high cards) to the bottom of the deck. Making the "discard" option the most important part of your strategy is the key to easy wins.

I suppose this would be different in a multiplayer game, but still, I sold it.

It was fun though. More fun than The Game.

The game's simple rules tie with the theme beautifully, as there is a rhythm to the game that has to be mastered. The game is a bit of a brainburner despite its small size, therefore it is hard to play it often or repeatedly.

Simple cooperative puzzle card game. It is pretty much a better version of The Game. The solo version seems to be luck driven (impossible no matter what you do or possible no matter what you do either).

RATING: 5
Don’t be deceived by the whimsical art and small package — Okey Dokey is a serious, difficult game. Its basic solitaire style game play could be simple enough for families, but the extra discarding rules make this too complicate for ours.

Very surprised by this small box game from TMG. They made a huge push to get it out to a ton of gamers on the Instagram community. I've received several games from them to review in the past, but this is easily the best. It can be surprisingly difficult, yet has simple enough rules to be a great family game. This is staying in my to go bag for work, family trips, coffee shops, you name it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is the Japanese game of cooperative solitaire where the players are trying to play cards in sequence in the five suits with the hitch that each color row needs a reset card played twice AND you must play a card of each color and a RESET card before playing a card in a similar color again. Use of Wild cards are in play to determine difficulty level. Reset cards allow you to play a card of a lower value and basically resets the string to 0. You will need to determine the rules for how much talk occurs in what ways.

Reminded me of [i]The Game[/i]. You are trying to place cards down to form a 5x10 grid of cards and if you don't play the cards you lose. add some wilds to help make it a bit easier. Played several times and really am enjoying this one! Cute artwork and vibrant colors. Definitely liked it more than The Game and look forward to more plays!

I think I've played this at all player counts now and I feel like four players is the hardest for some reason.  The fact that five players allows that person that finishes a column to go again feels weird at first, but it makes the game a lot easier.

Hmm...why would I ever play this again? It's not nearly as pretty or charming as [thing=186767][/thing]. It's not as social or fun as [thing=98778][/thing]. It doesn't have any rainbow hippie wizard gnomes like [thing=150061][/thing]. So what's it good for? I still need to figure that out. It's an OK-looking cooperative game where there's very little to actually cooperate about. The restrictions on communication are minor and the choices are fairly obvious. It really feels like the rules as included are "beginner" rules and that somewhere on the designer's floor are the real rules that were omitted by mistake.

I am very happy with this cooperative game. I have even been playing it solo from time to time. It reminds me of the fun I was having with The Game and Hanabi. I think it plays a little faster, more interesting, and is more approachable to more people. I find this a more enjoyable game. I would even say that it replaces both of those other games, but my wife really like Hanabi, so we will likely keep those 2. I saw an re-theme art version of The Game and it was beautiful. I wonder if the colorful nature of Okey Dokey is what makes it feel better?

Only played solo so far, with a single equals card, and at first it seemed silly hard (I didn't draw one color for the first eight turns, if I didn't have the equals card in my hand to start I would have lost right away), by the midway point of the game I didn't think it was a challenge at all. So the only thing that made it seem slightly difficult was the initial draw of cards, which seemed a bit silly.

Whereas The Game, which this is often compared to, feels like a brutally hard game even playing it solo.

That being said, I have a feeling I'll like this a lot more once I play it with more players, as then you have more limited information and need to make plays somewhat blind, like Hanabi. I have a feeling this will bump back up to a 7 or 8 once I play that way.

The art is really cute and nice for being basically colors and suits, by the way. There's unique animals and instruments on each card. It's a very attractive game.

Okey Dokey is a deceptively challenging game! Teaching and learning HOW to play the game are simple, but playing it WELL is EXTREMELY tricky. I really like the cooperative puzzle and love the cards. The artwork is cute and looks really nice both when the cards are held in hand and when they are all laid out on the table together. The game has many similarities to Hanabi and The Game, but I like Okey Dokey best. I have had a lot of fun playing and LOSING at this game, but am completely hooked and definitely won't be turning down any opportunity to play it more!

Light cooperative card game filling the space somewhere between Hanabi and The Game but I like it more than either of those. You alternate turns playing cards from your hand trying to build out lines with cards in ascending order. Each row gets two resets. You all lose if you can't make a legal play. It was cute, but not anything I need to own.

Played with a Rage deck. Note that this can also be played with Battle Line, Sticheln, Parade, or any other deck that has five colors in numbers 1-8. Just substitute a higher number for the "equals" cards, and you can just use any facedown cards as the "reset" cards.

The game is fine. It's definitely a big improvement over The Game, which is an awful game. Both games have you cooperatively playing cards in a certain order, but Okey Dokey offers a little more flexibility in the form of the equals cards and reset cards. In our game of Okey Dokey we never had any problem playing cards during the game so right at the end we just had to organize which color each player should play. There was no real tension and the game just came down to whether or not we had the right cards to all be able to play at the end.

Because of the ease of play I'll at least give this another try, but I don't see it getting much play beyond that.

The game feels a little too easy with 2 players. Even without any equal cards, the game can easily be completed. Perhaps the amount of communication between players can be limited but overall, the game is fine, albeit a bit too easy to achieve victory. A cute game, a fun game but probably not the best with two players unless you want to bolster your confidence in coop games after multiple defeats from other harder ones (Geister Geister, I am looking at you!)

Nice little solitaire / co-op card game.  I appreciate that it has adjustable difficulty.  My GF and I had fun playing 2 players, and she enjoyed it playing solo (it was a gift for her).  Hoping the kids will enjoy it when they are old enough.  The art style took a little warming up to, came off as too childish at first.

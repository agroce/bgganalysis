RATING: 5
Perhaps I'm just not a big "railways" fan, but this didn't do much for me.  Lots of reading, lots of paths to making points, but it didn't excite me.  Better and more complicated than [b]String Railway[/b].

I hate the idea of this game so much.  Profiting off of someone else's great idea really sticks in my craw.  Especially when the original game had such a tiny run anyway.  In a word, lame.

Takes the simple charm of String Railway and tries to cram a much more serious game down it's gullet. It's OK, but that's about as far as I'm willing to go.

This is a cleverly thought-out game with infinite replayability. Cards become stations that you connect to with paper clip-connected tracks to score points, with some cards giving various game-end bonuses. No two games will be the same!

Far better than I thought and not much like String Railways. This is a game of deciding between strategies, resource management and card evaluation. Physical placement barely comes into it. Cardstock is a bit lightweight though.

Would play again if asked but I wouldn't own a copy. It is a unique take on the train theme.

I found the Rules and descriptions were not specific enough and a bit inconsistent and confusing.

The pieces are also a bit too fiddly for what it is and it feels like a cheap home made job.

The game needs a decent number of players to be interactive and make the most use of the nextworks but at the same time it slows down the game.

I liked the idea of the different stations and the restrictions on them, but yeah... dunno.

RATING: 4
Players extend a railway line across a playing surface, earning victory points for connecting to station cards.  Players on their turn either draw three station cards, or create a railway track link made up of coloured paperclips to connect two station cards together.  Links increase a player's network, and earn them victory points for the length of the link and the terminal stations.  The weird thing is this game is totally freeform - you define the playing area, locations of the hazards, and where you place your track and stations.  Quirky, fun and slightly problematic in that the stations and paperclip tracks are very easy to nudge around - definitely play this on a surface with some friction!  I'm enjoying different these days, and this is different!

RATING: 6
Takes the idea of String Railway and turns it from a filler into a proper game.   Luck of the draw with the station cards is still a huge issue, so it can't be played too terribly strategically.   The stations are more clever here, and can only link out to certain prescribed types of stations at minimum distances away, so you have to do some planning.  Interaction is encouraged via built-in scoring incentives.   Doesn't really make sense, but it works just fine in terms of game play.   Adding a string map boundary to this game is recommended for ease of play.

RATING: 4
The inspirational source (String Railway) is pretty obvious in Paperclip Railways, yet the game is very different. It basically replaces the strings with variable-length paperclip chains to build routes, turns the 20-minute string placement gimmick into an hour-long combo-building game.

While the game improves slightly on the blocking/route-building aspect by making crossings more expensive it also becomes quite a bit more fiddly with the paperclips and heaps of station tiles. At the same time, it fails to fix the luck-of-the-draw issues which are tolerable in a filler.

So, when the novelty of placing paperclip railway tracks wears off, what's left? Not much. The special functions of the stations you link to (mostly one-time effects or end-of-game bonuses) aren't special at all. Building routes isn't all that interesting either, partly due to generally fairly short routes and thus little interference and often rather solitary station building, and partly because depending on your station draws exciting bulding options are often fairly limited. A mediocre route building game at best.

Paperclips are a significant component of the game.  They are the railway track.  Weird huh?  And it's an interesting game.  There are some rough edges, but some games from the name publishers that have the same problem.

RATING: 5
The principle of laying strings, paperclips, noodles or whatever to build track sounds intriguing. But as with String Railway it sounds better than it is in practice. The analogue nature of placement reduces sharpness of gameplay instead of opening up possibilities. While String Railway has the advantage of quickness, Paperclip Railways is beyond the filler range with not enough depth to warrant it. It's a game of combo building with an added less important spatial component but getting the right combos is mostly a question of luck with bland and obvious strategic routes to develop along. The whole gameplay feels unpolished in its build-draw-build cycle. Comment is based on a three player game. It might be better with more players.

New to collection, June 2011.

This one was not enjoyable at all
It just feels like a drag and cards have exception on rules that are not explained.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ugh. Firstly, the quality is bad. Secondly, the rules are ambiguous and game breaking. Maybe it's meant to be like this but the cards and combinations are not equal. Thirdly, there is no clear border or limit and placing the paperclips and stations are so open ended that there are bound to be many rule changes just for the sake of making the game go on. I will prolly never play this game again. It's just too annoying for me.

If you aren't giddy just looking at the pictures of this game, there is something wrong with you.

Finally, those years of building paperclip chains finally pays off!

An "OK" game which provides a different take on a railway network building game. To me, the clipping of the clips together is annoying rather than amusing and the game too random for the playing time of over an hour.

First impression (4 players): I like this a bit more than String railways : Transport because this one has more gamey feel with the way you can manipulate length of rails by adding more paperclips onto them. This one too falls a bit weird ground by being a "serious" economy game on the other hand but having quite powerful cards that don't fit into this type of game imho.

Hand management and route building, with difficult decisions, including which cards to discard for track, when to spend VPs to cross tracks, and spatial planning for where to build.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Connecting stations with chains of paperclips sounds boring but the game is quick fun and has some nice ideas going for it. Limitations for building the tracks are logical and good way to limit the game. The stations themselves are not that balanced though and with a couple of lucky draws you can take a huge lead over others. Will play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light, fast fun - but there is a bit of strategy in the route building and hand management. It pays to be attentive to the conditions on the stations the other players are placing - and build out to them to take advantage of their benefits. 

Played a 4 player game - sadly, there were two sets of yellow clips and no red so we couldn't play with a full contingent.

This is a really lovely system.  Yes, it certainly has similarities to the string railways games, but there is so much going on here that is in and of itself.  I love playing off of the powers of the cities, and making combos.  The hand management is fun.  It is simple, but yields lots of little decisions.  Yay!

The concept worked, and I enjoyed the idea of creating a relatively free-form network, but the tedium of joining paperclips together sucked a lot of the fun out of the game. Adding up all the end game bonuses is also a bit tricky & time-consuming.

I'm actually now more interested in trying the game that inspired this: String Railways.

Takes the novelty of String Railways and puts a game on top.  The hand management is very good, and gives you tricky decisions over what to keep or discard.  With plenty of cards I can't see luck of the draw being too big an issue.  Does have a "fiddle factor" as the paper clips/stations/obstacles are all liable to nudging, so don't play with serious rules lawyer type gamers.  Is fun, although runs to 60-75 minutes so not the filler game that String is.  however it is a very good game (and does not take ages to setup/pack up as has been suggested.  You don't need to unclip every paperclip)

My rating is very tentative, as I am not at all sure we were playing correctly. The rules and many cards are rather ambiguous. I would really prefer that, rather than make at least three editions of this game, the designer would settle down and polish the game, then publish ONE edition with clear rules and a well-tuned deck (the Express deck felt rather too large and random).

The card text are too 'busy'/ feel random. I wish the cards were categorized to different piles/ strategy, (and you can choose to draw which pile based o your preferred strategy).
Not a bad game, though..

This is a fairly innovative little game - and the cards are all incredibly fun and keep the game fresh.

It plays relatively quick and is easy to teach as well!

The only downside I'm seeing is the production value (it isn't terrible by any means but nothing to write home about) and the amount of time it is to break down and put away.

Really good game!

An endearing game for me.  The essence of table top gaming.  I can imagine Mr. Boydell on some rainy day with some paper, a pen, and a handful of paper clips creating this networking city builder.  Easy to learn gateway rules with enough strategy and card synergy combos for seasoned gamers to experiment.  Clever cost mechanic for building routes over obstacles and hazards that adds a layer of territory control and negotiating landscape.

Probado y jugado a 5 en Jesta 2011, se hizo pesado y largo, estaba recien salido del horno y faltaban aclaraciones de reglas. Pero hay que probarlo en condiciones, con las reglas 2.08 y con menos jugadores.
El juego tiene potencial y chicha de gestión de recursos, de subastas de los mismos para dar y tomar... y el diseño medieval del juego en general es ENORME. Pedro Soto en mi copia se curró un dibujo brutal de guerrero medieval en la contraportada :D

RATING: 7.2
I found the mechanisms rather tedious to understand and learn, and I hate it when randomness kills my chances (doesn't matter that I might lose anyway). I played once, and one player rolled no daughters at all for the whole game, whereas I had at least two for each try. Guess who won and who lost.

 Juego más que interesante. Con muchas fases. Tienes la sensación de agobio del agrícola, esa de tener muchas cosas que hacer y no poder hacer nada junto con unas relaciones de vasallaje que hacen que el juego esté muy compensado y que nadie se quede atrasado. Tiene puntuaciones muy apretadas y equilibrios muy interesantes. Se nota que está probado, pensado, repensado y testeado. Un gran trabajo para reflejar una realidad (la época feudal) bastante complicada de explicar. Un gran juego.

Impressions after 1 five player game. Its a medium-heavy euro game. A lot of things going on. You can build castles, construct the church, conquer new lands, combat other players, trade resources, have kids and mary them, go on crusades and make enemy knights your vassals. Uses many mechanics like majority scoring, worker placement, blind bidding, one round bidding, resource conversion and diplomacy. You can get VPs in many ways. The end result is that the game doesn't flow very well. Its quite fiddly  and its also a beast to teach this to new players. Especially the whole vassals thing is quite complicated while it is one of the major ways to win the game. Nice high quality omponents. Weird that the cubes and meeples are plastic and not wooden. 

Update: After another play things start to make more sense and the game flows better. Still I dont like the whole Lord/Vassal relation.

Very thematic, interactive worker placement with some interesting mechanisms. Unfortunately, the time I played it didn't seem too polished: possibly rules translation problems? If this were sorted, the potential to be a very good game.

MIL is a solid game that can be quite fun to play. The game's biggest problem is that almost every rule has at least one exception and this can mess things up if you don't remember them. MIL also have a problem that i tries to do a bit of everything so it takes a while to get into the flow of the game. It has elements of workerplacement, resourcemanagement, auctions, area control and risk management. The ageing mechanism and the family planning that followed was fun. And I really liked the vassal part.
Rated after one play, I think the rating will go up if I play it more.

MIL is not a game for players fearing complexity.
The rules are quite convoluted and long to explain and digest (although everything makes sense and "fits" thematically). Things are not made easier by the (textless) player aid.
BUT once you go past the intricacies of the rules and the vassalage, there is quite a game here!
MIL is about harvesting and managing resources, and getting new workers (knights) and placing them around... it would seem pretty standard fare, isn't it? Nope! The rules for vassalages provide a complex structure of (giving and catching) incentives, and everything is dripping in theme!
Initial rating is 7, but it could very well go up with more plays (if the playtime gets shorter when the players learn the game...) if there's enough diversity in play patterns to justify the time needed to explore the game.

The rules are a bit hard to swallow, but the theme is implemented fantastically. Engaging and profound, this game is simply great. It's worker placement done in an interesting and cool way.

On the bad side, though, is that the game is LONG, and there are many different systems that you have to remember, meaning downtime and AP are not rare.

Good high-weight eurogame. A lot of things going on, maybe too much for me, at least in my first play I felt overhelmed by the multiple things to care about during the game.

I'm sure that more experience in this game should improve my rating as use to happen to me with most hard euros.

MIL's designer and his group of friends/playtesters are top class people.

This game is tragically under-appreciated. This is one of those multi-dimensional games where you want more of lots of things, but the costs of acquiring them is fraught with challenges, and they are at odds with each other. This game has both direct competition (more so than typical Euros) and also direct cooperation (also more so than typical Euros). The game is thematically very rich. It is zero-luck though (other than a blind bid), which does make it go a bit slow for thinky players. The rulebook in the box has issues (or had, depending on version), but the rules you can download online are pretty solid. It says it scaled to 5 players, but 4 seems about right to me.

RATING: 3
Surprisingly quickly after Spiel, where I tasted only a little bit of MIL—the game is quite difficult to pick up from a rulebook and the explanation was really bad, which is to a point understandable given that the explainer had more or less lost his voice and was the sole person available to man the booth at that time—I was able to attend a game and play it to completion.

Even with prior knowledge MIL turned out to be a tricky beast to even begin playing with. Several elements vie for your attention, and they are all linked together. Although after these two games I finally have an idea, I'm not going to summarise it here: it's a convoluted mess which needs either to be explained in detail or not at all. I count myself lucky that on my repeat play I actually got 99.5% of all rules correct. And looking back, I wonder why I went through the trouble in the first place. MIL is the archetype of game where human players are made to operate complex machinery instead of creatively playing their way out of tight spot by means of flawless insights into the patterns evoked by simple rules. The rulebook proclaims MIL to be a 'deep' game, but I'm going to disagree with that description: cramming a lot of stuff relying on various machanisms (worker placement, majorities, bidding, blind bidding, resource conversion, constructed partnerships, ...) into a title does not automatically make it amenable to detailed ply analysis. MIL is far too sequential for this: you can only do so much in the first phase of a round (where knights appear in the 'power spheres'), and in the second where their combined effects are established. it is difficult to guesstimate the effects beforehand. Literally, it depends on so many things that complex tactics seem to slowly work their way into the entire thing just the same.

If I look at what makes MIL MIL, then I'd say that it is the vassal system. A knight of one player can attempt to make the knight of another player his vassal: this sets up various bonds and obligations between the two knights which is mostly profitable for the vassal's lord. But instead of exploring this system which is [i]really[/i] rare (I can only think of Confucius as the other example) and offers plenty of opportunity for intruiging gameplay, the author of MIL saw fit to make vassalage more of a static one way street: The vassal can't shake his bonds, may ask for help only which need not be given, may not even attack other knights of the player owning his ass. On top of it all lands the vassal conquers give points to his Master too. That's a pretty sucky situation to be in, although one which promotes specialisation in becoming the player to Rule Them All due to the unstoppable military force, or in becoming hard-working land rats who do all the work and rely on others protecting them. All in all I think I prefer the more fluid model of Confucius which keeps matters interesting for all players.

In the end I think MIL needs some serious development work to cut away a lot of the rules chaff which is currently burdening it. There is just too much stuff crammed into a too tight space resulting in too much multiplexing. MIL is not a game for casual players; and if interested parties are willing to spend more time with the game I'm not sure that the game play patterns are sufficiently diverse and interesting to keep those parties spending that time with this game. I think it's good that I was able to try this title, but I don't need to try again. The rate ... I suppose I'm being rather harsh because the system, complex as it is, does seem to work, so designing it can't have been an easy task. But smooth and creative challenging gameplay got lost along the way, and that is an error from which the current design cannot easily recover.

An excellent worker placement game with hidden bids and  resource management. The game gives you loads of option with little room to waste an action.

On the fence. Is this another euro cube pusher without soul or a game that is inspired by medieval feudalism? I can say MIL is a complex game, both ruleswise and strategywise. probably need a couple more plays to fully understand this beast.

Though the rules overload on MIL (1049) is a bit high, once you can get past that MIL is quite a game. The game has two phases, in the first you perform mostly resource buildings actions that require the use of time counters to indicate the passing of time and its effects on your extended family; after a certain number of counters are added to the knight he dies and his heir, if any, takes over the family lands. As you do so it reveals access to more powerful actions in the “spheres of power” that allow you to convert your resources into victory points and directly interact with other players. The decisions involved in which “spheres of power” to select with your knights, and when to transition from the resource generation actions to the “sphere of power” actions are both fairly entertaining particularly with how the game simulates the vassal-lord relationship that was so important during this part of the middle ages.

Essen 2011: comments after 2 games:
this has the potential to  be judged as at least an 8 BUT;
I won't ever buy it because
a) I still don't really have a clue what I'm doing, but it FEELS great
b) this game seems to have quite a flat learning curve. Therefore as a beginner you inevitably won't stand a chance whatsowever. This is what I personnally dislike, because for me it is no real fun to play a game without real competition for the victory.
b) VERY complex rules so if you are not playing it more or less frequently you would  most likely have to go through the rules again with each new game and basically have to start all over again when it comes to both strategy and tactics.

MIL (1049) has a million things going on it, most of them uninteresting. Like Mecanisburgo, this is an example of a designer taking all his favorite things from all his favorite games and forcibly cramming them into one big Super Game. In short, Kitchen Sink Syndrome punctuated with overly frequent blind bidding interruptions.

The guy who invented this game must have a very interesting and complex brain. 
You might want to get out your ibuprofen before opening the rule book. It took us about an afternoon to get to read and understand it and about 1 or 2 games to (almost) master it. But maybe we're stupid, so don't get discouraged! However, once you've mastered the rules, it's really worth it.
The game is very well thought out and there are many different actions to choose from. It is filled with little subtleties that I've rarely seen elsewhere. I can't go into detail without explaining all the rules but let's just say that all the different possibilities make it very interesting.
Honestly, I don't understand why this game doesn't have a better rating and why I don't see it more often in game shops or cafés. 
The only thing that bothers me is that the victory is based on how many points you've collected, but that's the case for most (fairly) intense and interesting strategic games. Also, the way the points are given make more sense to me than most point-system games.
Actually, I'm trying to find a game as interesting and original as MIL but with a different way of winning. That, to me, would be the ultimate strategy game.
I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because of the VPs, but that's just because it's not my preferred winning system.

El típico juego en el que los participantes operan una mecánica más bien compleja que les impide ser creativos. Da la sensación que el diseñador concentra lo que le gusta de sus juegos favoritos en el suyo propio (colocación de trabajadores, gestión de recursos y del riesgo, subastas, control de áreas). Por ello se clasificaría como "sólo para jugones" Mecánicas interesantes: el envejecimiento de los caballeros (cuantas más cosas haces, más rápido envejeces). PROS: El tema se respira (no tienes ni idea de lo que hay que hacer durante las primeras partidas, pero molan) CONS: Valor de los recursos algo caótico para mi gusto. Cada regla tiene una excepción o caso especial. Reglamento poco claro en temas como el vasallaje. Vasallos: como alguien te tome como vasallo en el último turno¡¡PUM! +15 PV´s. ¿Kingmaking?

I really didn't enjoy this, although my friends felt it 'could' be good if we put some effort into inventing the rules that weren't covered by the given set. Many of the mechanisms to me felt "lumped together" without any real cohesion, although there were some interesting concepts in there. 

I did like the bidding mechanism where players bought into an auction, and then with closed fists would reveal how much they were willing to pay for a certain benefit at the same time. Actually this was really fun. But no one ever knew what strategy that bonus was working with, and because of the complexity and mix/mash of mechanisms it actually felt like the winner was purely determined by chance.

An interesting, "different" eurogame, which includes more or less every eurogame mechanic you can think of: Worker placement, resource gathering, build-your-own-little-realm, auctions. Potential for a lot of direct conflict makes for a refreshing feel. The whole vassal system is also a breath of fresh air, and takes a little time getting one's head around.

However, the game's a little long for what it is, and more than a little clunky. The verdict so far; an OK game but nothing outstanding.

Played one round and my group of very experienced gamers had to abort the mission.  The rules were just too hairy to get through.  This needs a really good player aid and strong examples.

RATING: 2
This game did not work for me. I had to rate it a 2 simply because I cannot be convinced to play it again, ever. The resource usage was very fiddly (there are at least five distinct blind bids that each require a different combination of resources), the action selection uncompelling (which time tokens to take made little strategic difference), the worker placement tension missing (it was simultaneously easy to get what you wanted and difficult to place all of your workers), the rewards counterintuitively worthless (neither start player nor additional knights were that important). Defense is nearly impossible: You can never stop a determined vassal-er, and outright attacks are less rewarding than vassaling.

Aside from all the individual complaints, however, the biggest knock against the game is that despite all of the interesting-on-paper mechanics, it's just not compelling enough to warrant play. I'd rather play just about any other game in the top 200 than Mil, especially because any hint of AP or indecisiveness in a player can stretch the game unbearably long. My 5-player game went for three hours! I'm sure this is unusual (because 3 of the 5 would place their knights without thinking ahead to what actions they actually planned to take) but not incredibly. Players are constantly taking actions, choosing targets and making bids such that even ten seconds of thought gets multiplied into 20, 30, 40 minutes of dead time. Just not good.

Absolutely awful game where the designer did pretty much everything wrong one could do. Way too complex for no reason, way too many different mechanisms, but worst of all, the theme doesn't work well at all. The vassalage system makes little to no sense and the power spheres are severely limiting and really don't make for a good game, let alone a thematic one.

Despite sharing a number of mechanisms with In the Shadow of the Emperor, MIL failed to win me over, coming off as too clunky and long for what it is. The core dynamic here is taking over other players' knights as vassals, but the game grafts too many additional subsystems on top of it, each with its own set of finicky exceptions.

It's certainly in keeping with some of the other new games I've played (Macao, Hansa Teutonica), in which players are presented with boundless options and there are so many ways to score that almost anything you do will get you a victory point. But unlike those games, there aren't really multiple paths to victory: here, it's all about the vassals. Let your opponent take over one of your knights toward the end of the game and BOOM they're up 15 points, which is pretty much impossible to come back from.

Therefore, you either have to keep pace by becoming someone else's Lord, ensuring you never become a vassal, and/or keeping your vulnerable fiefdoms unappealing to aggressors. Finding that balance alone might make for an interesting game, but having to play a clunky version of In the Shadow of the Emperor with elements from several other games on top of it makes the experience far from enjoyable. I might be willing to try this one again, but am not really looking forward to it.

Seriously complex German game with extremely heavy theme integration. Really hard to wrap your head around.

The rulebook is amazingly good for a game of this much theme included but there are several ambiguities, some of which are based on poor structuring. Especially the vassalage part would need serious reorganizing and clean-up. There are also some unintuitive elements, like flipping the tiles, which should be emphasized more heavily. Also, it's a shame they have not bothered to include a proper framework for selecting the tiles available in the game.

Very good component quality, with a weird usability oversight: All the resource cubes are in player colors. The board could use some usability engineering as well, especially the location effects should be shown on the board.

The resource flow is hard to figure out: Definitely needs a player aid which lists where each resource can be acquired and used.

Odd game with unintuitive mechanics and quite possibly the worst player aid ever published. In fact, not having one might have been better, due to the fact that it only gives you some of the options you have so you forget about the other stuff.

After first full play Surya thinks that this games has the problem of 'the rich getting richer'. As I was the rich :D I didn't have that feeling, future plays will tell if he's right or not.

What I really like about this game is the mechanism where your knights die if you take to many places with time counters on it.

One minus point: the complexity to make someone vassal or conquer land

Played 2011-11-12 with all new players and rules being read from the book. Felt interminable. With rules explanation, the experience lasted 4 hours.

I could imagine liking it more, but man, it was too complex with fiddly unintuitive rules concepts (and some unanswered rules questions).

And it has really unhelpful bad text-less player aids with often very cryptic unclear iconography, plus you have to keep flipping the 2-sided player aid over to try deciphering the info on each side. Put all info on one side, silly people!

I won't rate it based on a learning game with the explainer also not sure about details... but at this point I doubt we'll play it again.

RATING: 6
A complex Euro combining some elements of worker placement, action selection, resource management and direct conflict. The mediaeval thematic elements (finding an heir, marrying off your female offspring, vassalage etc.) might make it individual enough for those who are into that type of Euro to add it to their collection. 

I'd say that it is a game for fans of Agricola who always wanted to invade their opponents' farms, but I think that makes it sound a little more exciting than it actually is: those truly into thematic games might find it a bit dry. There is a lot of optimising your actions, changing cubes of one colour into another etc. I've also never been keen on combat systems involving blind bids of resources that determine the winner.

I'd certainly play it again, but I can't see myself requesting it.

MIL would be yet another worker placement game if it didn't have some twists that make it special. First, the spots to place the knights have to be opened by previous players' actions, even when they can enter a closed one paying a price. This also bring some tension to the game in order to calculate when to stop making actions that allow to open a spot, and start placing your knights. Second, there is a majority subgame, cause not only the action is in play when you place a knight, but also points, resources and special actions for the player that has the most in different areas of the board. Third, the original part about knights getting married, having kids and growing old, and the importance of their succession. And last but not least, the serfdom relations that can be formed between the players. All together, the game is an excelent recreation of the medieval times, and its mechanics fits perfectly with the theme. The game lenght is maybe its flaw. It probably lasts one turn longer than it should.

Rules are badly translated, BUT, it's all clear once you read the various clarifications on BGG, and once you have ironed out the rules, it's really quite simple and plays easily. Good strategy options - several ways to win - none of which I found on my first play!

This started out as a simulation of the middle ages and was later turned into a game. It seems to be a fairly realistic simulation. That is, you roll a die to determine whether your knights will have daughters or heirs, and if they don't produce a heir before they die, you're screwed. And for all the daughters, you just have to pay tons of upkeep, or get rid of them by paying tons of dowry. They tried to offset the disadvantages by inventing stuff like "the more daughters you have, the less honourable it is to attack your house", but by and large, getting daughters seems to be a *huge* disadvantage, and depends on dice rolling. As I said, it seems rather realistic.

Compré la versión inicial de 2011. Hice un turno de prueba yo solo, no me aclaré así que lo tuve guardado como 2 años (las críticas que leí sobre él no ayudaban a probarlo). 
En 2015 me bajo la última revisión del reglamento del 9/10/2014 (12 páginas en lugar de 10) lo pruebo en solitario 3 turnos y veo que el juego ahora funciona muy bien. Acabamos de efectuar una partida a 4 jugadores y ha sido un éxito. Esto pasa por lanzar un juego con un reglamento escaso y/o insuficientemente testeado. 
MIL transmite muy bien la "química" medieval, conforme se va jugando se comprueba que no es tan difícil como parecía en principio, pues todas las acciones y consecuencias poseen su lógica. Prácticamente no tiene azar y casi todas las acciones posibles son positivas. Las subastas y el consiguiente "faroleo" son una de las claves principales. En suma, un gran juego, especialmente para los amantes de la época medieval pues es muy temático.
Lástima del reglamento inicial, aspecto que por otra parte ha tenido remedio.

I bought the original version of 2011. I did a test shift myself, I do not cleared so I had saved as two years (the reviews I read about it did not help to prove it).
In 2015 I was download the last revision of the rules of 10/9/2014 (12 pages instead of 10). I test it alone 3 turns and I see that the game now works fine. Just make a game to 4 players and has been a success. This happens for releasing a game with a short rules and / or insufficiently tested.
MIL transmitted very well the medieval feeling, as it is being played is found that is not as difficult as it seemed, at first as all actions and consequences have their logic. Virtually no chance and almost all possible actions are positive. Auctions and the resulting "bluff" is one of the main keys. In all, a great game, especially for lovers of the Middle Ages as it is very thematic. 
Too bad the original rules, something which otherwise has had solution.

A clear example of a game not being developed. Too many unclear spots in the rules, fiddly. And a fatal flaw: longish. Despite three veteran players, the fourth player, less experienced gamer, simply asked us to stop it after 3hours, as he was bored to death. One of my worst post Essen 'blind test' sessions for years!

A medium-heavy worker placement. The aspect of having your knights age is undermined as you can always tell exactly how long they have to live and so can prepare (have an heir) without any difficulty. This makes the ageing mechanic largely irrelevant, but I enjoyed the game as a whole. The vassaling was a little confusing, especially if you're not familiar with the terms in the first place.

Ultimately, a good game if not one I'd always be rushing to play.

Update: On a third play, there's a surprising amount of take-that available and the rules are still massively unweildy. There are just too many games that do a similar thing more smoothly.

Rating down from 7.3 to 6.8.

Your family struggles for prestige and influence in a medieval society. Will you succeed?

In MIL (1049) you can harvest your lands for resources, recruit soldiers and have descendants. But that's just the first generation! If you have a male heir, he can be married to another player's daughter – the one with the biggest dowry, of course! A strategical key point, though, keep in mind that during the game your knights will die or retire and their sons will have to take their place.

Knowing the ins-and-outs of the court will help you gain influence and vassals, while in the market you will be able to trade resources and recruit the necessary workforce to build a castle. How about going to battle to get some new lands or helping the curia to build the Cathedral? The abbess of the monastery can bless you with influence, while the echoes of the Crusades resound in a faraway land with songs of glory and honor. There isn't one single way that leads to victory – so which one will you choose?

An odd duck.  Mechanically, very Euro.  Produce cubes to turn in using various mechanics for VPs, including three different kinds of auctions, area majority, and worker placement.  It works, though it's not particularly intuitive, and could use some simplification.  I didn't even get through the first phase of five before my group was complaining about the length of the rules explanation.

Thematically, this feels quite different.  There's plenty of chaos and the resources are linked realistically to their actual uses.  There's no "turn in a fabric and food to build a scribe" here.  Instead, influence is gained by marrying into families, spending time at medieval feel-good events like, er, the Crusades, or at court.  Food is used for things that make sense like feeding an army.  There's even a neat little ouroboros of a semi-closed feudal economy here.

The game hews closely to the political realities of paternal feudalism.  You run a thinly veiled protection racket on the peasantry, while you and the other nobles gleefully squabble over control of those peasant homes through military might.  Ostensibly this is for some kind of financial gain, but mostly it's just for the status that you'll gain among your peers.  It doesn't matter if the hill could be taller with a bit of cooperation; all that counts is that as you stand on top of it.

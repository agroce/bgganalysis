I have only played Battle Line, but got rid of it in order to acquire this game. They are the same, but I prefer the theme of Schotten-totten. 

It's a delightful little two player games that packs a lot of punch. I'll update my comments once I have started playing again, but the memories of this game are certainly good ones.

Great game! It's indeed "Lost Cities meets poker". I like the illustrations way better than "Battle Line". Winning is a bit random (haven't used the strategy cards yet), but who cares? Great light 20min fun!

It's more or less the same as Battleline except it hasn't got any special tactics cards, but then again, I'm told that the latest version does.  I really like the ability to use the special cards, so for that reason I prefer Battleline, but the games are so similar and both of them are amongst the very top 2 player games!  The artwork on ST is better than on BL, though.

Very tactical. 2 good players will have some very close and exciting matches.
Don't see a need for the Tactics cards, although my edition does include them. Artwork is fantastic.

RATING: 5
It's an ok game.  It's better than many 2-player traditional card games.  My wife isn't that keen on it, I guess I think it's ok now and then.  Lots and lots of logic and tension.  That's cool.  A little lacking in fun.

I think the original Schotten Totten rules (no tactics cards, no 10s) are better than Battle Line, but I like the Battle Line graphics better, and you can ignore the new components easily.  The game DOES feel to me like a struggle through enemy lines, so the new theme fits, weak as it is.

RATING: 9
Great 2-player card game with lots of tough decisions. Similar to Lost Cities in some ways but more satisfying after a win and a much better game. Very simple for non-gamers to grasp. Battleline by GMT is roughly the same game but it doesn't have the nice quality cards that the ASS version has. Battleline also adds the tactics cards which IMO dilutes the intensity of the game by giving players the opportunity to avoid playing from their hand when there really isn't a good play. Solid and quick card game.

Such a high amount of replayability in such a small box.  Superb value.  Reiner Knizia has proved himself a game design genius once again with this simple, tight, clever, engaging card game for two players.  Simply wonderful.

A bit worse than Battle Line for 2 reasons:

1)Cards go up to 9 (at the end there are no cards left to draw)
2)It's not that easy to recognize at a glance the cards that have been played (Battle Line has more gamer-friendly colors --- but no better artwork!)

My (non-gaming) wife doesn't like this as much as Lost Cities. I like them both but this seems less free-flowing.  ps Sticheln cards can be used.

Bought after failing to get Battle Line.  Actually I think this is better - the idea of Scottish battles over boundary stones - much more exciting!?   
This was much better received than Lost Cities, I think that's because there's less maths involved.
I want to try the tactic cards.

This game is fabulous, and positively mental, even when you're just playing the base version and not the Tactics variant.

Gyakorlatilag ugyanaz a mechanizmus, mint a Battle Line-nál. A két játék a grafikán kívül egyetlen akciólapban tér el: ami itt 7-es, az ott 8-as. Csak azért adok kicsit kevesebb pontot, mint a Battle Line-ra, mert amaz szebb. De ez meg jobb anyagból van, tehát kevésbé fog kopni (a Battle Line-on 1 játék is meglátszik!).

Nagyon jó játék, 9 kis csata dönti el, hogy ki nyeri a háborút, a pókerben ismerthez hasonló formációkat kell képezni 1...9 értékű harcosokból, akik hárman alkotnak egy csapatot. Az akció kártyák feldobják a játékot, de jókor kell elkezdeni őket felhúzni, se túl korán, se túl későn nem jó (szerintem). A szabályban sajnos van több dolog is, ami nem volt elsőre egyértelmű...

Furcsa, de nekünk kezd jobban tetszeni a játék a spéci lapok nélkül. Változatosabb azzal, de néha irreálisan belenyúlnak azok a lapok a játékba.

[i]Posted: 5/18/07 Rated: 8[/i]

[i]Schotten Totten[/i] was on my radar after doing a GeekBuddy Analysis, and I was able to pick up a copy with a recent order from Germany.  Being a Knizia game, it is easy to start trying to draw parallels to [i][gameid=50][/i].  What I have found is that this game has a greater level of complexity.  Nine boundary stones lie in between the two players.  To win the game, a player must control any three adjacent stones, or else five total.  Players alternate placing one card each turn on their own side of the board.  Up to three cards are played next to each stone.  The best three-card hand controls the stone.

[i]Schotten Totten[/i] doesn't have the same "starting reluctance" as [i][gameid=50][/i].  You must play a card, and your opponent cannot pick up a discard (there aren't any discards).  However, you must be cautious that you don't play haphazardly: there is a special rule that lends importance to every card played.  If you already have three cards next to a stone at the start of your turn, and you can prove your hand will beat anything your opponent can play, then you can claim that stone.  This is a key component of the game: you must be careful not to telegraph a weak hand, and allow your opponent to scoop up a stone with an easy proof.

The victory conditions with respect to the stones means you must also strategize about where to play your cards.  You can try to win three adjacent stones, or you could hold onto one of your better hands for use defensively.    Thus "board" position is an important consideration.

[i]Schotten Totten[/i] may have a whimsical theme, but its mechanics are very solid.  It was a great stepping stone from [i][gameid=50][/i] for my wife.  When she was comfortable with that other game and ready for a little more complexity, [i]Schotten Totten[/i] fit the bill perfectly.

[i]Updated: 7/27/09 Rated: 10[/i]

After two years of owning and playing [i]Schotten Totten[/i], I still look forward to being able to bring it to the table.  My usual opponent is now my eight year-old son, who is quite good at it!  My initial impression was wrong: there is the same level of "starting reluctance" as there is in [i][gameid=50][/i].  I do not always know when I start a row if I'll be able to complete it with a better three-card set.

The "proof" aspect is also exquisite in its agony.  Careful observation of the board can result in elaborate proofs, and my son is quite adept at finding them.  I love the critical thinking skills he is developing.  All around, this is a sure-fire winner, and a go-to game for two players.

A great 2p "combat" card game. No, not really combat. You're playing cards on either sides of stones where the best 3-card poker hand will claim the stone. With 9 different spots to potentially place cards and the balance of getting cards played while trying not to telegraph your moves (AND the luck of the draw hoping you get cards you want) there's quite a lot of depth in such a simple game. I haven't yet played with Tactics yet but it only seems to make the game better or at least different. Also, this game gives a similar feeling to Lost Cities which is another game I love. This one feels a notch more complex just because you can place cards anywhere rather than only in their color lanes so there's more to think about.

Schotten Totten is a fun two-player card placement, area majority game, where you control the area by having the better poker hand of 3 cards there. Cards can't be picked back up once placed, so you get to  a point where you can reason out that you will necessarily win this spot based on what your opponent has there. Get 3 in a row, or 5 out of the total 9 spots and you win.

Very fun and interesting, while being easy on rules and pretty quick. One con about the game, is that the beginning is pretty nebulous. With 9 open spots with no real difference among them, where to play the cards can seem random. Also, while there are certainly very strategic decisions, the winner may well have just gotten better cards. 

Still very fun, though if you are looking at this game, i might recommend hanamikoji instead.

Asterix version. Printed on cardstock, sprayed with 2 coats of Deft Wood Finish Gloss. Great result, I can actually gently shuffle the cards. The fronts & backs are slightly out of line, about 1/20th of an inch on the sides, so I cut using the back lines.

I liked this game Very much, my husband not quite as much, so the rating is his.

Taken me a long time to get around to playing this and my first experience was not overwhelmingly positive but I learned long ago not to judge Knizia's games on first impression as repeated plays tend to bring out the nuances - here there are similarities with Lost Cities and, though I can't imagine it being as good as that classic, that is enough to make me look forward to future plays.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A great hand-management filler, where the concept may seem simple (play a card, then draw a card), but it still offer a lot of agonizing choices as around mid game, you don't want to fully display your strategy but you still have to play a card to continue drawing cards to feed your strategy. So you need to choose your battle carefully (card lane where you play your cards) in order to win the war (game). This is thus a game with some strategic depth.
++ Relatively small table footprint and really portable game that can be played really almost anywhere.
++ Super easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The box is a bit too big for nothing, and this game could have benefited a good small insert to hold everything in place.
-- The player aid cards should have had tactic cards description on the reverse instead of the exact same information on both side.
-- The number color should have been a bit more saturated and contrasted to easily see the different color in lower light environment.
-- I'm not a theme fanatic, but the theme is just pasted on, as it could have been anything and it would work (as we see as this game is a reprint of Battle Line, which was a reprint of the first Schotten Totten).
-- It's a 2-players only game, and for whatever reason, I don't like buying 2-players only games, even though I play a lot of my game just with my wife.

The GMT remake (Battle Line) works better for me because it adds a nice, if still quite thin, theme, and the action cards add some flavor. Some flavor is clearly required here to get past the 3rd or 4th play. In this genre of game, though, Clash of the Lightsabres is still my runaway favorite.

First play was a bit odd - I had Poker hands in my head so to me a Flush or straight should beat Three of a kind.

In my first few plays, I underestimated this game- it's all about keeping track of what is already played. It doesn't take long for you to get stuck committing to something you  cannot accomplish, and just hoping your opponent does not realize it before you can take 3 sequential stones. And that's when I fell in love with it. I like it more than Lost Cities, and I love Lost Cities. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
In an ideal world, you'd know in advance all the cards you will have access to before committing any of them to the playing field.

The world of Schotten Totten is not an ideal world.

So the game is all about hedging your bets. Where you can dump your weak cards? What cards offer the best hopes? 

Then, the claiming rules, might have you asking yourself if you should play a card not for the card itself, but because it will let you claim a stone elsewhere, or, alternatively, not playing a card you want to play in order to prevent your opponent from claiming a stone.

That's the tension right there, in an imperfect world, what card should I play and where.

Avoid the tactic cards, some of them can potentially break the game because they were designed for a deck of 60 cards, not 54. Also, they don't make the game better, just more random.

A clever, tight game. Kenny Rogers foresaw this game when he said you have to know when to hold them and when to fold them. With two ways to win, which stones you give up on, and which ones you fight over, because odds are good you won't win all of them, is essential and often quite painful.

I enjoy this much more than Lost Cities.  Lost Cities forces you to commit early to a position, then hope you can draw the cards.  In Schotten-Totten, you need to avoid committing as long as possible to keep your options open, and it just reeks of delightful tension.

Sadly, I loaned out my copy and it never returned.  :-(  But at least I have Battle Line still.  :-)

RATING: 7
A classic numbers game of playing 3-card poker hands to either claim 5 stones in total or 3 consecutive. This is definitely a Reiner classic akin to Lost Cities with how simple the gameplay is and ability to play multiple games back to back. The new IELLO version has great art, much better than Battle Line and also includes the tactics cards as an "expert" variant. Without the tactics cards that let you manipulate the game it's a straight play the best hand that you can so these 10 extra cards do add a nice variety to the game. My only concern with them is if someone draws the majority of them if the other player has a good chance at winning. Surprisingly given the poker feel my wife enjoys it and is willing to play it so it's a keeper.

I've never cared for poker, but I like this game quite a bit.  It works on many, often subtle, levels.  Personally, I like the artwork, and the original version's lack of special "tactics" cards.  In my opinion, one of Knizia's best - and that's high praise.

That having been said, I don't see playing it every night.  And it is a card game - i.e. you can find yourself at the whim of Dame Fortune.

I love this game. It is simple, elegant, and strategic. I enjoy being able to play with or without the tactics cards and enjoy the game in both forms. This is a fantastic game for my boyfriend and I to play mid-week as it doesn't require any real set-up and it pretty quick with a good amount of 'thinkines' involved.

The new Iello production is gorgeous, though I wish there was a symbol or something to help distinguish the 'suits' (which are colours) because I do find myself having to look closely to distinguish them in certain lighting.

Tricky and quick 2 player Knizia card game that presents a simple concept, but puts you through the vice continuously as you try to claim stones without leaving huge gaps for your opponent to take advantage of. Luck of the draw can certainly come into it at times, but forward planning can mitigate much of the luck and the game is fast enough where it didn't really bother me in the least.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Siempre quiero jugarlo. Una baraja de 54 cartas compuesta de 6 colores con 9 números en la que cada carta tendrá un solo un sitio en el juego de los 54 posibles ni uno más ni uno menos. La baraja del Battle Line le añade los números 10 además de las cartas tácticas, aunque las barajas de ahora del Schotten Totten las traen pero no los dieces. Es difícil decantarse por jugar con las cartas tácticas o sin ellas, pero lo cierto es que sin ellas todas las cartas encajan perfectamente en el juego.

Otro punto muy a favor es la  facilidad de poder jugarlo con cualquier baraja de otros juegos, todo el mundo debería de jugarlo por las calles. Un clásico moderno que tiene una rejugabilidad ilimitada.

Este juego es un Knizia, juego sencillo tanto en su diseño como a la hora de calcular su probabilidad ¿Por qué no lo diseño otro? Porque Knizia solo hay uno y solo a él le publican juegos tan sencillos, por algo será.

La mayoría de mis partidas han sido al ST sin tácticas no al BT. Partidas marcadas en el Battle Line.

Si te gusta este juego también es conveniente que le eches un ojo a los siguientes: Schotten Totten, Battle Line, Lost Cities, Medici, Marco Polo Expedition y la serie de 10 days.

Components: Good quality cards, but very simple artwork, with colors that don't leap out at me (and aren't color-blind friendly).

Experience: I like this more with each play. Because any card can be played anywhere, there are many agonizing decisions to be made, deciding which stones to contest and which to use as dumping grounds.

Proving that I will win a stone no matter what my opponent plays often requires playing an otherwise irrelevant card from my hand. Committing a second card to a stone, and thus revealing my intentions, is also painful.

Knizia's second-best game.  The tension mounts as you struggle to decide which stones to concede and which to try to win, but you can't know for sure becuase you don't have enough cards.  Much deeper than Lost Cities or Tabula Rasa, its closest relatives in the Knizia family.

I had high hopes that this would be my go-to "coloured cards with numbers" game (it came down to this vs. Lost Cities) but it was not to be.

I think, like Lost Cities, that there are not enough decisions to make here.  Sure, you make some decisions on when to start a hand, and what to go for, but once the cards are down you're just locked in and waiting to see whether or not you get the cards you need.  A lot of the times, the battle will be decided well before its over.  Then there's the times where you have to figure out "Ok, I need the purple 7 to win this hand, or I need to stop you from getting a 5, or ..." and then its just luck of the draw.

Love the iello art, though!

For now, Arboretum will be my "coloured cards with numbers" game.  It has so many more tough decisions at all stages of the game.

Really nice (filler) game. Although luck plays a not-so-small role in it, it`s not that bad because a game only lasts for about ten to fifteen minutes. 
Don't expect Schotten-Totten to be a game where you can formulate a strategy and then execute it. It's all about dealing with the cards you have and making the best out of them by analyzing the cards that have already been played. And what I think is great about this game: Sometimes you just have to take a risk and see if you can get away with it.

[30-08-2009 Rating 7 -> 9]
This game is really fun. There more I play it, the more I see that there is some kind of depth to it. It's not a brain burner, but once you start to pay close attention to the cards that have been played and the positions where they have been played, the game reaches a new level of fun.

It's a bit of a joke how good this two player card game is. It's tactical, it's strategic, it's a bit luck orientated, but neither is it very long. To be short, it's fab. The iello version features decent photorealistic art of genuine Scottish people. I'll rerate this, most likely higher when I have explored the tactical variant more. What makes matters worse, or is that better, is that reliable Reiner probably blurted the design out before lunch one day when it was raining. Maybe even before breakfast. Highly recommended if your looking for a game that is both very simple and also very decent.

[b]The theme:[/b] Based on the theme, in [thing=372][/thing] you are one of Scottish clans and are fighting with your neighbour over border stones. At least that is what the rules say and what the pictures on the cards look like. But it is one of those games that could basically have any theme, as for you, the cards are not "big woman with log" but rather "7 of some color that fits into your straight or doesn't".   

[b]The components:[/b] It is a Iello game so the production is amazing. The artwork is super fun and consistent, the cards are of high quality, the stones also. 

[b]The fun:[/b] 2-player tug-of-war card game, who wouldn't like it? It is very head-to-head and makes you feel all kinds of emotions (mostly frustation, true, but at least you give a sh*t). 

[b]The gameplay:[/b] It feels like a standard card game (and if you managed to make 2 more colors, it could be played with a standard deck of cards). You can play with or without tactic cards which change the game a lot. It is very fast and you are constantly trying to outthink your opponent. Great little game and I am glad I own it.

I've come to this game late, after having my copy for some years. I've actually played Los Banditos a few times recently, and it's evident that Knizia is re-using the ranking from Schotten in that game. But Schotten has a lot more in common with Lost Cities. I can see you've played the red 6, so that makes my red 5 and red 7 useless for a Run in one colour. So timing and placement do count for something. It's quick, easy to play and enough fun to make me want to play again. At last.

Nem sok érdeklődést mutattam iránta, mivel az elveszett városok/keltis knizia játékgyár egy x+1. tagjának éreztem csak (jó tudom, ez a legkorábbi közölük :)). Ehhez képest hatalmas meglepetést okozott, mivel az elveszett városokkal ellentétben itt tényleg sokkal több van a játékban, mint azt elsőre az ember gondolná. Nagyon kell agyalni, hogy mit hova tegyünk. Ugyanakkor gyorsan lefut egy játék, nem foglal sok helyett, nem drága. Lehet, hogy beruházok egyre.

RATING: 5
Schotten-Totten is a quick two-player card game where players quarrel over a patch of grass in the Scottish highlands. This is done primarily by collecting sets of three cards that valued higher than those of your opponent. A few special tactics cards spice things up by adding stuff like fog or traitors.

There are some decisions to make but at the same time you'll have to make do with whatever cards you get. The tactics cards spice things up a little but it still feels like a slightly souped up Rummy variant. At least it's very quick.

Super-fun 2 player that plays very quickly. Tension is always present, and as is typical of Dr. Knizia's games, you want to draw a card before you are forced to play one. Frustrating in a fun way! The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is the fact that the theme is completely tacked-on. I somehow just don't feel like I'm in the Scottish Highlands trying to prove my superior strength through a game of tug-of-war, even despite the fact that one of the Scots isn't wearing any bottoms...

I used to play Battle Line a lot, but found that I didn't care much for the tactics cards. Therefore, we would play without them and my family and I enjoyed that experience much better. As you might know, Battle Line without the tactics cards is almost exactly like Schotten Totten (as play prior to the most recent version). Like most Knizia games, ST uses a simple ruleset to squeeze some beautiful tension into a short amount of time.

[2015.04.15]

I realize now that my house rules for Battle Line were just S-T (with the 10s removed).  I like this much much better than BL-base-rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I had to play this twice to get the hang of it and really appreciate it.  You don't want to reveal your strategy until you absolutely have to so you play your cards carefully.  It's scored sort of like poker, but you can win faster if you win spaces in a row.  This ads a spacial aspect to the game that is very unique and allows you to strategically up the value of certain spaces in order to force your opponent into touch situations.  The game is quick to play, simple to learn, but has an incredible amount of depth.  You will find yourself biting your nails in deliberation.  Unfortunately, this is both the games greatest strength and its greatest weakness because often, I don't want to play a game that is so intense.

Schotten-Totten er blandt de mest spillede to-spillers spil i vores familie. Det er dog ikke mig, der er den, der vælger spillet. I hvert tilfælde ikke længere. Men det behøver jeg heller ikke, for det er der en anden, der tager sig af. Og selvom Schotten-Totten ikke rangerer blandt mine yndlingsspil, regner jeg det som et solidt konstrueret kortspil for to personer, som takket være det faktum, at spillet særligt i afslutningen har en tendens til at gå forrygende stærkt, gerne efterlader en god stemning. Og i øvrigt ofte bliver fuldt op af endnu et spil og måske endda endnu, endnu et spil.

Well, well, well. So that's the great dr Knizia? Hmmm... I was scared, that this game will smash my home opponents by it's difficulty, but it didn't, really. With every gameplay you see more and more tactics. That's fabolous! I must play it more.

Pro Ludo edition - cards quality sucks. I donno' why, but I've got some problems with 2 green (dark and light) colours... maybe cause I play in the evening?

An excellent game.  The card quality of this is nicer than Battle Line although the theme is silly, and the artwork is silly too.  In the end, I think this game plays best with a Sticheln or Rage deck.  You really don't need a theme for this game at all, as it is perfectly fun and playable without cartoony Scotsmen.  Granted you can't play the newer version with the added 'tactics' with a Sticheln deck, so keep that in mind.

I'm happy to have enjoyed this Knizia classic as much as I did! It's so simple to understand yet there's a lot of depth of play, especially if you play with the tactics cards. They add more randomness, but I still prefer to play with them because they add a lot of tension and more choices.

This version is beautiful with great and colourful art, typical of Iello. I think I'd prefer to play without the 10 value cards that's in the Battle Line version of the game, because it makes the deck too big without really adding any fun gameplay.

It’s an improvement over Lost Cities which share similar mechanics, especially played without tactics cards (which I did). This is a tug-o-war type of game where you have to fight for your wins by playing different hands one card at a time. It’s one of the more interesting quick fillers, even though I am totally sold by the look of the game.

BattleLine minus the Tactics cards.  Both are terrific 2 player games.

BattleLine is a "gamer's" version of this game in that it adds a mechanic in which you can affect your opponent's side of the table.  That being said, I often find myself very much enjoying the (relatively) simpler play of this version of the game.

Very good.  Surprisingly exciting and challenging considering its simplicity. Choices are interesting and become agonizing as the game progresses.

Optional tactics cards are quite ok AS LONG AS you play with the standard rule of claming stones at the beginning of your turn (proving that your opponent can't beat you on the particular stone is then performed without regard to the unplayed tactics cards – this is confirmed in FAQ btw).
  Tactics cards can refresh the game after some time or just increase 'fun factor' for some players.

EDIT:  It just refuses to grow old...

PS Games / Ubik version (French rules)

Simply a masterpiece of 2-player card playing.  Elegant simplicity.  Games are quick, but intense.  The proof element of claiming adds just the right amount of thinking to a card game.  As the game progresses the tension-level rises as you are forced into playing cards each turn.  I've given away many copies to friends and everyone who has played has loved the game.

Initial Rating: 9.5 (June 2011)

Outstanding game, it´s now firmly rooted in my top ten favorite games. It is very easy to teach and learn but it has a huge strategic depth. I really like it. For me this version is almost the same as Battle Line, Schotten-Totten has worse theme but a higher quality of components, the only real disadvantage are the tactics cards, in Schotten-Totten the cards don’t have any text so I have to refer to the manual to play with them, but as I really prefer the game without tactics cards this is not an issue for me.

I still like this game a lot, but as I’m trying to adhere better to the BGG´s rating guidelines I will lower its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the rating guidelines.

Nowadays I almost never want to play Schotten-Totten. It is a good game but I now prefer heavier games. This is a good game to play if I don’t have much time. Still I like it a lot but I’m downgrading its rating yet again.

I won’t say no to a game of this, but I don’t propose it as often as before. My GF loves the game as do I, so I won’t get rid of it.

RATING: 9
Has the Knizia touch of appearing simple but requiring a lot of thought!

I don't think the special cards carried over from Battleline in the recent Pro Ludo edition add to the game. The base game mechanisms are tight and simple in a typically Knizia way. The special cards add a lot of chaos to it, meaning what should be a good or bad play can actually be the opposite with the right special card. Still good, but I prefer the purity of the base game.

Reiner finally came up with the goods for me (Modern Art is almost there) with this game. Schotten Totten is the thinking couple's Lost Cities. It has so much more flexibility while still retaining the difficult decisions. I'm told this is exactly the same game as Battleline, however the artwork wins me over with this anytime. I have also yet to play it with the wild cards (action cards) I can't see how they benefit the game except that they give get out clauses for those who can't deal with the tough love of lady luck.
UPDATE: The game has jaded a little in my opinion over time, the game consists of a little too much waiting for cards and the workings of the game are easy to consider and become a little boring.

Played using Trumpet cards. As expected, it was short, tactical and interesting. Will play more when the opportunity arises.

Upgraded from 7 to 8. This is good stuff. Now also played with Rage cards.

Note that although Schotten-Totten is now sold with tactics cards, this entry is rated for play without them, and my rating for Battle Line, where they originally appeared, is lower to reflect my distaste for them.

This is better known as Battle Line. This was the original. It has one key difference. The cards are numbered 1-9 instead of 1-10. This makes Schotten-Totten a tighter game, which I prefer. If you have Battle Line, try removing the 10s and see how it plays.

Battle Line is a great game.
This version has wonderful art but lost something of the feel of battle line by reducing the size of the deck.

It much more quickly becomes a brain burning exercise of creating proofs than Battle Line does.

Nekem tetszik ez az új IELLO kiadás, így végre magyarul is megjelent a Schotten Totten, és ez már önmagában is nagy dolog. Most, hogy néhány év után újra játszottunk vele, azt kell mondjam, nagyon jó játék... de nem használnám hozzá a speciális kártyákat. Egy számkártyákkal játszva az, ami, az extra kártyákkal szerintem nem az igazi, szerencsére itt is csak variánsként kezelik.

The base game is absolute perfection. No action cards needed. Brilliant game.

Luck factor is significant, so you should always play best-of-3, or best-of-5, perhaps best-of-17.

Stone claims should only be allowed at start-of-turn, not the way yucata.de does it.

I definitely recommend this over Battle Line, but if you get that, take out the 10s and play it by Schotten Totten rules!

In Schotten Totten, nine boundary stones lie between you and your opponent. In front of each, you build poker-like formations of three cards on a side. Whoever plays the higher-ranking formation wins the stone. And in a unique twist, you may use your powers of logic to claim a stone even before your opponent has played all three of his cards, by demonstrating that the stone is impossible for him to win. Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.

With Battle Line, you can also play Schtten Totten.  I like ST but I like BL a little bit better.  The extra Tactics cards in BL adds another smaller deck to the base game (which essentially is ST).  I tend to think that this extra deck "balances the luck with luck" against the base deck more times than not.  I also suspect that the first player has a disadvantage in going first since the 2nd plyr gets to see what that card is and where it's placed...

Played online.  Clever game, but I'm not sure how much I'd like to play it.

Just like "Lost Cities", this is a poker deck with more suits added to it.   Knizia should stop marketing these kinds of games and just release a "Gamut of Games" type book like Sackson did, using household components.  I bet you could play this game with a poker deck and just use less stones, say five or six.  At least then you wouldn't have to look at pictures of dwarves.  I may try that, though I'm not so enamored of the game that I'll rush to do so.

Fast game play, with lots of strategy and tactics.  Simple rules.  High tension from the beginning on; knowing what to hope for and when to commit cards on the board is hard.  The standard rule allows for more strategic and tactical control, but I appreciate the surprises brought about by the "tactics" cards.

Much more "linear" than "building" games like Race for the Galaxy or Magic: the Gathering, but always a great experience.

A very well-crafted abstract that I always love.  A classic.

Revised up to 9 from 8 on 14th December 2011.

A firm favourite in our flat.

Quiet, unassuming, simple, beautiful Shotten Totten you are twice the game of Lost Cities but get half the praise of your peer.  A greater level of competition, strategy and understanding of odds balanced with a simpler method of game resolution (a straight flush beats three of a kind etc) without the uneccesary appendages of L.C. (the superfluous board, oversized cards) means that Shotten Totten will endure while L.C. will gain dust in my games collection.

RATING: 8
I'm a bit torn about how much of Schotten-Totten is in the hands of the player and how much is luck, but when I'm playing it it feels like I have enough control to make it meaningful. The catch there is that for the first two-thirds of the game You are really laying to reveal as little information as you possibly can to your opponent. Every bit of information your opponent has helps him decide which plays he can safely make. He learns of one more card he won't get to complete his straight, he knows how strongly you're going after flag X, he knows when you're out of safe moves.

And this is absolute torture, but in a good way. Trying to decide which play is the least revealing when you have a paucity of real information (your hand, the cards you have already played and the card your opponent has already played) feels like a meaningful decision that you just can't quite make with what you have at hand. You have to rely on general strategic (largely statistical) principles that you develop yourself through experience. Also, when you do get an easy play, it's such a relief that it's actually really fun.

It may seem odd to recommend a game that tortures its players like this, but I genuinely enjoy it. It melts your brain and twists your guts. It's almost like a horror movie for gamers where they are the protagonist.

The one real downside to this is that ST can cause significant analysis paralysis in players that are taking it seriously. Like I said, it feels like you can figure out the right play if you just work through the implications enough, and that's a bit of a rabbit hole you can go down. Eventually you have to trust your experience and your instincts and a bit of analysis and play. Of course you could completely blow off any attempt at thought out play and play by your gut, but that would sap all of the delicious tension out of the game for both players, I think. And what's the point in that?

A quick note: Battle Line is the same game, except it adds some special power cards (the latest German version of ST includes them as well). I haven't played with them, but it seems to me that they would cut the tension out of the game by rendering analysis and strategic instinct meaningless, since one special card can undercut the foundation your were analyzing from.

Excellent two player card game by the good Dr. Knizia.  Low rules overhead, and lots of depth.  There are sprinkles of deduction, bluffing, feinting, positioning, and some luck.  I very much enjoy the colors and art of the Iello version, which adds to the enjoyment.  Excellent as teh pure 9 cards with not tactics, but it's also nice to have the option to use the tactics cards for added variety.

This game can be surprisingly tactical especially if you use the tactics cards. Given the unpredictability of the draw strategy is limited to which stones you will attempt to win or if you will play in a initiary or reactionary manner.

This is Battle Line but without Tactics card.

In my opinion Tactics cards just add unnecessary chaos and detract from the beauty of the original game.
To quote Reiner Knizia (designer of the game): "For me, the game without Tactics cards is the pure game." And I agree! 
By Knizia's own admittance:  
"The idea to change the theme for Battle Line and add more complexity with the Tactics cards was a marketing decision. American game publishers said the American market is different; the American market wants more complexity and details. So I designed the Tactics deck specifically for this purpose."

I still suggest buying Battle Line version because theme is a bit more appealing than the Schotten-Totten and you can always play by the Schotten-Totten rules (without the tactics cards) as the game was originally supposed to be.

Meh. Played once without special cards and once with them. No desire to play again whatsoever. (Not that big on most 2-player games to begin with). The special cards really should have some words on them to say what they do so you aren't constantly having to reference the rulebook to look them up (the symbols on the cards are pretty useless). Or at least a player aid for them. Cute art.

Hmm. I played Battle Line first, and I liked the tactics cards, but playing Schotten Totten without them, now I'm not so sure. Maybe there's more strategy here; there's no room for sloppiness. drunkenkoala's lengthy review would suggest as much. 

Moving this up to an 7.5, which is really as good as it gets for a card game for me. (see also Ticket to Ride) Keeping in mind I don't consider San Juan and RFTG card games.

My play is with the Battle Line game but without the tactic cards, as in the original Schotten-Totten.  I love Battle Line, but I almost think I like it better without the tactics cards.  It is a little less chaotic, slightly more strategic, in my opinion.  But of course there is some luck in the draw in either game and both games are very good. Maybe my favorite 2 player game, certainly of the shorter variety.

Még azelőtt megvettem sajnos, mielőtt a magyar kiadásról tudomást szereztem volna. (Persze ennek nagy jelentősége nincs, csak elvből inkább a magyar kiadásokat támogatom, ha tudom.)
Tipikus Knizia: 2-3 mondatos szabály, faék egyszerűségű játékmenet, emellett néhány játék alatt beláthatatlan mélység. A Schotten Totten esetében is pontosan ezt érzem; egyelőre fogalmam sincs mi számít jó lépésnek. Ez azért fura, mert egy közepes nehézségű stratégiai játék esetében egyből látszik egy-két nyerőnek tűnő, erősebb stratégia, illetve a körödben mindig van optimálisnak tűnő lépés. Knizia játékok esetében közel sem érzem így, néhány kivételtől persze eltekintve. Elképesztő, zseni a csávó.
Mindenesetre két negatívumot tudok felhozni a játékkal kapcsolatban. Az egyik inkább személyes, hiszen legutóbbi alkalommal pl. túl nehéznek éreztem a játékot, nem volt kedvem számolgatni - szóval ez erősen matekos társas (ismét: Knizia), bár én szeretem az ilyet, de ezek szerint velem is előfordul, hogy valahogy nem áll rá az agyam. A másik szintén ezen játszma volt, hogy mindezek ellenére simán nyertem, mert hozzám került szinte az összes magas lap (pl az összes 9-es). Nem meglepő a szerencse befolyásoló szerepe, hisz kártyajáték, de ennyire ez már zavaró volt, bár hozzáteszem, hogy a taktikai kártyákat még nem próbáltuk. Az lehet, hogy segít ilyen esetekben, illetve vélhetőleg kicsit meg is fűszerezi a játékot. Úgyhogy nemsokára bedobjuk őket, de addig is az alappal "küzdünk".

I find Schotten-Totten/Battle Line to be more elegant and much deeper than Lost Cities.

I decided to go for Schotten-Totten instead of Battle Line because it is the original game and the tactics cards were included in the version I purchased. I also thought my wife would prefer this theme because we've actually been to Scotland (it makes absolutely no difference in the end).

OOP?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Schotten Totten is a solid little "thinky" game. It does feel a lot like playing multiple hands of "mini-poker" at once. You try and get the best hands possible across 9 separate battles(hands) by building up straights, flushes, 3 of a kind etc. I certainly haven't mastered the game yet by any means having only played a few times but I think I can already say it is certainly a game which rewards not putting all your eggs in one basket... you need to know how to utilize your cards in the optimal way to potentially set up as many winning hands as possible. You need 5 out of 9 winning hands to win the overall battle OR any 3 battles in a row so there are alternative ways to set yourself up and variances in how how you and your opponent may be thinking about the hands as well. Do I put all my strongest cards into 3 neighboring battles or spread the strength across the board? You need to know when you are beat in a particular battle and be able to quickly switch your focus to those which you can still win. For such a simple looking game it certainly has enough depth to make replays interesting and I'd have to say this is one of the better 2 player filler style games around. Certainly recommended as it is dead simple to learn and teach yet has enough depth in the decision making that I think most people will find it draws them back for repeat plays.

My favourite filler. Plays like a dream, I have the new Pro Ludo version with the tactic cards (which makes it the same game as Battle Line), but we never play the game with them as it takes away the finesse and adds heaps of randomness and luck. One of the few games in which I almost never lose (card player background). Highly addictive and very good life span.

An excellent two-player game. Just the right balance of a cardluck, skill and playing time.

Update: The more I play Schotten Totten the more obvious it is that with players of equal skill it comes down to the cards you draw. Simply by being lucky you can win. Still as it is really a 10 minute game and it can be played competetive between players of different skill level it is one of the best two player fillers. There's always time for one game.

Released in the same year as Lost Cities, Schotten-Totten is another light card game by Rainer Knizia that is based upon laying cards on the table forming groups. This one, though, is clearly superior: most of the rules tell what groups of cards are mightier and draws are still very important, but the play is way more dynamic (more choices, more risks, more reward).

This is an amazing 2P game, much deeper than first blush. Playing 9 miniature poker hands, one card at a time -- simultaneously -- is agonizing. But in a deliciously fun way.

The Tactics deck (a mere 10 cards) adds a LOT of a whole other layer to the game play. I used to own the previous incarnation known as Battle Line, but I like the compact box and art of this newer version better, I think.

Schotten-Totten isn't much to look at, but it sure is fun.  It's a fairly simple, fast-moving game.  The set-up reminded me of Lost Cities in that opponents are vying for possession of, in this case, stones that lie between them.  You can claim a stone either by having a more highly-rated combination of cards in front of it, or by proving logically that your opponent couldn't possibly come up with a more highly-rated combination (based on which cards are already in play). (4+4)

(28/06/06) Tof spel (voor 2!), met genoeg 'pestgehalte' en bluf.  Probeer als eerste 3 aangrenzende stenen (of 5 niet aangrenzende) te veroveren.  Doe dit door het uitspelen van kaarten.  6 handkaarten die telkens worden aangevuld met een nieuwe kaart uit de trekstapel.  Ook de lay-out mag er zijn.  De tekeningen van  de verschillende schotten zijn subliem. (speelden mee: Ann en ikzelf)

The reason for rating this quite a bit lower than average is that I always felt my destiny was chosen for me. I know I'm going to get every second card from the deck. Whether I choose this combination path or the other is simply based on probabilities, and hope, based on not much information. And then we find out later whether I'd chosen right or not. Ho hum.

Excellent two player game. This has become a favorite for my wife and me. Great mix of hand management and logic. I gave my copy of Battle Line away after getting the new Iello Schotten Totten version. Same game but I like the presentation better on Schotten Totten.

Same comments as Battle Line:

Such a simple but tense two player card game.  I like it a bit better than Lost Cities because any card can be played in any column.  I also appreciate not having to count a ton of VP's at the end; first to claim 5 flags or 3 adjacent flags wins. Luck can easily be a factor, but a cunning player will win more often than not.  One of the better two player only games out there, IMO.  

UPDATE:  This could be the best two player only game out there.  And as said above, luck is there, but for a card game the luck factor is relatively low.  There are just so many ways to misdirect your opponent that a skilled player could easily win with inferior cards.  Great game.  And Knizia probably designed it in his sleep.


Minor differences with Battle Line:  Though the artwork is good in this new edition of ST, it is a tad busy and it is a bit harder to look at the table midgame and locate all the cards of a particular color.  I happen to prefer using the tactics cards, which this edition has, and it would have been preferable for the suits to number 1 to 10 instead of 1 to 9 because of that.  But, if you only have access to one edition, certainly get this.

Agyalós, kétszemélyes kártyajáték. Hasonlít az Elveszett városokra, de mégis teljesen más. Itt a középen elhelyezett köveket kell megszerezni az ellenfél előtt, jól megjátszva a kezünkben lévő lapokat. Mivel a lapok sorrendje teljesen mindegy, így útközben is tudunk stratégiát változtatni. Fontos figyelni az ellenfél lerakott lapjait is és nagyon át kell gondolni minden egyes lépést - emiatt is jobban tetszik, mint a Lost cities.

RATING: 9
I've played with only number cards, and I have to say, the system is awesome. You may play only total of three cards on a column and then compare (at any point of the game) whether your opponent can play there better three cards or cannot. You win when 5/9 stones is yours (or three adjacent stones alternatively).

RATING: 6
A thematically charming card game in which Scottish clans fight over a borderline of stones (cairns), the strongest trio of Scots allocated to a cairn claims it for their side. Players who thought Lost Cities was a no-brainer may enjoy this one as well as those who are familiar with Brag: this is because the trio clan are ranked according to 'mini poker' style combinations (running flush, 3 of a kind etc), but here they are given thematic names such as an ordered clan or disorderly rabble. For those not familiar with these card sets may find the ranking a stumbling cairn...er, block to enjoying the game. Such combinations makes for interesting and thoughtful play as you gauge how strong your opposing trio is going to be and what values you should commit or waste. But it suffers from the "David & Goliath" effect, in that the tableau of gradually revealed cards means increased cross referencing as to what you should play (the exact opposite feel to Lost Cities which has some pace and spaces in suit values are easier to determine as colours are placed in their own columns). The main gripe for me is the amount of thinking involved can sometimes be a waste when you are dependent on drawing the right card which feels to me as an unfair payoff, whereas in Lost Cities you could at least increase your chances of by discarding a valued card your opponent will pickup, giving yourself a consecutive opportunity to draw from the deck. In the perfect world I would want Lost Cities card play with Schotten Totten's scoring mechanic....hmm Dr Knizia... Lostotten Schities pretty please?

Slick, beautiful, pure, sick. This feels like two-handed Taj Mahal to me - it's about managing a bunch of different lines of attack at once, desperately trying to keep in your head one too many sets of probabilities. It's about fluid play, rolling with the punches. 

Is good. 

It feels sort of like it wasn't so much invented as was always with mankind, and Knizia just looked within himself and, hey, there it was.

Tartalmazza a taktikai lapokat is, illetve a Battle-Line lapjait is.

A játékmenet meglehetősen "száraz" és agyalós. Ráadásul az elején elég randomnak érezhető, hogy melyik lapot hova tegye le az ember. Nem igazán váltotta be a hozzáfűzött reményeket. A sakkhoz tudnám hasonlítani (vegyítve egy kicsi pókerral :D ).

~4 év altatás után újra elővettük.
Agyalósnak agyalós, de kezdem kapizsgálni a lényeget. Kniziás egy játék, nem rossz, többet kell vele játszani, hogy kijöjjenek a mélységei.
Mindenesetre továbbra is eléggé túlértékeltnek tartom, ám pozitív irányba változott a véleményem.
A taktikai kártyákat nem használjuk, mert véleményem szerint feleslegesen nagy random faktort generálnak.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game, related to Battle Line but in a more pure form. The number of card ranks drop from 10 to 9, and there are no tactics cards. I enjoy playing both versions. You can play Schotten Totten with a Rage or similar deck, so it's a hotel game (but maybe not for the plane, takes too much space). I don't understand why so many people compare this game to Lost Cities. The similarities are superficial (playing cards to opposing sides at specific points) or generic (fun, light, two player game). Lost Cities is essentially a game about investment, while Schotten Totten is a multi-hand poker game with a positional element (you can win by capturing three adjacent stones). I guess I can see how Schotten Totten has an investment element (each stone can have three troops next to it, and by committing a troop you close out certain possible hand combinations) but the decisions are far more complicated than in Lost Cities, where your big concern is where and whether or not to risk beginning/increasing an investment. Lost Cities also lacks the element of forced play, because in Schotten Totten you cannot discard -- at some point, you have to fill in the ranks and create complete 3-card poker hands. Schotten Totten is also more confrontational than Lost Cities, because only one player can capture any given stone, so you're trying to make better hand than your opponent at each stone. Whereas in Lost Cities the interaction is very indirect, in that playing a card means that card isn't available for your opponent to play. I will concede one more similarity with Lost Cities, which is in knowing when to give up on a card or position, and place your focus elsewhere. Ok, thank you for listening to my treatise; buy this game.

Slightly more logic-intensive than Battle Line, due to fewer possible numbers, thereby aiding your proofs, and this is a good thing. Also, the deck seems to run out more often. A great battle of wits against an opponent of equal skill, but plays can get automatic after a while. Like an advanced version of Lost Cities. Haven't tried the Tactics cards yet.

Always play the variant where you claim a stone at the start of your turn. It introduces one more tough decision into a game that has many (dump into the lost stone or not? what if your victory is too slow by 1 turn as a result?). It's also a balancing mechanism to help mitigate bad luck in the card draws.

The best card game I own. Far more tense and stressful than Lost Cities, Schotten-Totten oddly succeeds for some of the same reasons that Lost Cities does. Each game forces you to play the card first and then draw to replenish heightening the value of each card/play. I prefer Schotten-Totten because it has 9 areas to watch and offers a far less difficult scoring system.

Very addictive and short game which can't be played just once!

[8 plays] Battle Line is a better game in which Reiner added the special power cards which give additional options and another way out when the cards just aren't showing up for you. The theme is thin in either version, lucky cards are going to trump skill sometimes, but overall Battle Line's theme works a little better for me too.

Go play Battle Line.

Most recent plays completed 1-20-10 on Yucata with Gerard.

[2010-12-18]
Kellemes, könnyed, gyors kétszemélyes játék. A póker figurái szerint kell három lappal küzdenie a két félnek a középen levő kövekért. Ezekből vagy három egymás mellettit vagy összesen ötöt kell összegyűjteni a győzelemhez az egyik félnek. Simán csak számos kártyákkal is játszható, de extra lapok hozzáadásával változatosabb, bár nagyobb szerencsefaktorúvá alakítható.

[2017-11-04]
Az új kiadásban a lila és barna színű kártyákat még nem színtévesztőként is nehéz megkülönböztetni. A Battle Line grafikája is közelebb áll hozzám, mint ezé a kiadásé.

I love Battleline, but I have to say that without the 10s and the tactics cards this game loses many of the choices and ends up feeling a bit dry.  It is still the same game, but it just takes much of the excitement and overwhelming choices in hand management out.

I'm glad I have Battleline (I like the art better in Battleline as well).

When I first sat down to play this I thought it sounds overly simple and wasn't sure where the 'game' was. I WAS SO WRONG. There is so much to think about and so much going on in this game despite all the cards simply being 6 suits of cards numbers 1 through 9. There's some bluffing, some push your luck, some deduction. It's really a fantastic little two player game. My only complaint is that someone who is AP prone can really slow it down since there's so much to think about on some turns.

Part of my little card game crave. I was on the hunt for good card games that would fit into little plastic containers. 

Easy to carry around and easy to bring to the table. 
Among these are No Thanks, Love letter, Tichu etc.

This game is good....and unlike Battle Line, whose theme i find more interesting, this game does fit into a small box because the "stones" are cards and not the pawns.

Fast and fun game to play.

Decent two-player game by Knizia. I prefer Lost Cities, because it has a better focus. Haven't tried with the special power cards, but I'm not sure how much they would add. Would play this more often if my girlfriend was more inclined to.

One of my favorite head to head card games. Have iOS version of both Battleline and Lost Cities - prefer Battleline. Has good depth to complexity; easy to explain, quick to play, fun artwork! 

IF you play in low light situations, the yellowish and brownish cards can look very similar; you basically have to squint to see the color blind icons - WISH colors had more contrast and different icons were more functional/bigger! My eye is not looking at the pretty iello art when I play and most of it gets covered up in the pile :\

I think I actually like this game better than Battle Line because it's incredibly difficult.  The gameplay is almost identical, but the lack of the 10's makes this game very tough.

Don't buy this one though.  Buy Battle Line as you can play both games then.

RATING: 8
Played 5+ times.  It's very clever and it feels a bit like Lost Cities and Balloon Cup in that play a card draw a card category.  The difference is you have a lot more options about where and how to play your cards.  The first few cards are a bit of a crap shoot because you don't have a lot of information and the game definitely has an amount of luck, but most of my games have been fairly close.  Good tension right until the last card.  2006/05/04

Kétszemélyes, remek, vikinges témájú játék. A szerencse szerepe elég nagy, hiszen lapokat kell húzogatni, így a játékosok nem tudják mit kapnak késôbb, tehát a kezükben lévô lapokból kell döntést hozniuk. De taktikázásra bôven van lehetôség, hioszen nagyon nem mindegy hogy hova kerül ki a lap! Van-e a kô másik oldalán egy csapat vagy még nincs? Ha ott tobzódnak, akkor van-e esély legyôzni ôket? Komoly kérdések ezek.... fôleg a játék közben:)

The spawn of Battle line,  this is the much preferred edition in my opinion.  The bright graphics and large numbers are much more functional than in Battle Line - and actually fit the theme more appropriately,  as this is a light game of comparing three card poker hands across seven stones and in no way resembles a tactical war skirmish. 

I am in the minority on this one though,  as Battle Line is the far more popular edition.  In either case,  I will play this one anywhere,  anytime.

Phew, another great classical from a line of Knizia mathy games I love. A small package that packs a serious mental punch, kick and claw all combined into one. Players attempt to outwit each other by grabbing stones in the middle of the table either 5 total, or 3 side-by-side. By playing cards to form poker hands, one can grab stones not only by playing a better combination of card as compared to your opponent, but also attempt to out think them by holding back certain cards in your hand to prevent them from winning the hand. There is simply too much to say and explain in such a tiny amount of space that you just have to go play the game to experience it yourself. There are dozens of reprints and dozens of homemade designs out there, but I say the original Schotten-Totten remains the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
Battle Line is my favorite game, so I felt like I had to pick up a deck of Schotten-Totten when making a game order from Belgium.  There is really only 1 difference between the two games which is only BL has 10s.  ST only goes from 1 to 9.  I always felt the 10s were super-powerful so I miss seeing them.  I like the cartoony images in ST compared to the Roman art of BL, however the font is a little too artistic because I mistook a 4 for a 9 in one of our games.  Finally I prefer the "flags" of BL to the stone cards in ST.  And contrary to popular belief the later version of ST do in fact contain tactic cards.

Scruffy Scottish clans rumble for the control of a border region. Highly tactical 2 player filler card game. Players vie for the control of "stones" - the winner is declared once a player obtains 3 adjacent or 5 of the 9 total stones. Players alternate to lay cards one at a time and control is obtained by having the best 3-card poker type formations to one's side. An interesting mechanism is that control of a stone can be "proven" at the beginning of one's turn through the use of cards already played on the table. Not difficult to learn, can be played either "vanilla" style or with the extra action cards. Plays in 15-30 minutes.

fast-paced abstract 2p card game, I like it better than Lost Cities, Jambo & co. but generally want "more" in a game.

[+] easy to teach, fast-paced, quick game, tactical, a bit of guessing-game, a bit of race (just having any 3 cards is enough to win base, until your opponent can do better), a bit of "spacial" element (3 base in a row is immediate win)

What a nice game! I really like this. It is *much* better than Lost Cities, I think. Also, the cute animations and the bright colours really are fun. I haven't yet played with the tactics cards but so far I really like it without them. I have played Battle Line with the tactics cards but didn't think much of them. Perhaps I will change the rating after playing with the tactics.

I played Battle Line without the tactics cards, which I hear is practically the same thing as Schotten Totten. While I won't buy Shotten Totten (I can use my Sticheln deck instead), I do think the game (whether you want to call it Schotten Totten or Battle Line or whatever) is fantastically tense and engaging. Because this has a considerably inferior presentation to Battle Line however, I don't recommend buying THIS game. You can just buy Sticheln and play both games.

Why people prefer Lost Cities to Schotten Totten is beyond me.  This is a far superior game, with more challenge, strategy, and turn angst than seen in its sister.  There are elements of hand management, deduction, and territorial control, all wrapped up in a small deck of cards.  What a brilliant little game.

Unfortunatly not anymore. That's why I made my own Asterix style copy of ST. Finally I can play the game not only on computer.

This is a fantastic 2 player game trick making game! Lightweight rules and excellent travel dimensions make this an ideal companion for summer vacations. Suitable for children aged 6-7 and up (on the simple rules).

RATING: 6.5
Fun, simple card game with a nice amount of tension.  A great, quick game to take out with two players. 

It's only flaw comes at the end of the game where you are trying not to finish certain areas because your loss is almost assured.

It's not just the special cards ('cause I'm not really a fan of them), but I think the fact that Battle Line has six suites from 1-10 rather than six suites from 1-9, that make Battle Line an improvement over Schotten Totten. However, I like that Schotten includes the flags that must be captured as cards over the tokens. Including it within the deck of cards makes the game more compact and portable. Me likey for me travel pack o' games!

RATING: 8
Elegantly simple blend of hand management and risk-taking. I prefer ST over Battleline due to the lack of tactics cards and the larger suits. With only 54 cards in play, you have little room for error and are sweating bullets the entire game while you're waiting for a card or two (or six) that you desperately need.

Take [b]Battle Line[/b], remove the 10 cards, now give it actually good art and you have the Iello printing of Schotten Totten. A very abstract game about numbers and poker hands that does a surprisingly good job of simulating a line of battle if you squint hard enough.

It took me a while to decided whether I liked this Reiner Knizia game or Lost Cities and I have to give the edge to this as the tension that is built in this game is far greater than Lost Cities. One of the few complaints I have is figuring out the colors in low lighting is difficult and the symbols they use on them are hard to read. Other than that this is one of the better card games I've played in quite some time.

We usually play without the extra cards and this still beats Lost Cities hands down.

Played lots of time. A very nice and clever game for two players, quick but intense, where each decision matters and can make the difference between a win and a loss, while the luck of the draw plays a minor role. I have not tried the tactic cards but have read the rules - and I think I will stick with the basic, purer version.

Played online a few times at flexgames. It's OK, but I prefer Lost Cities, the lighter and faster cousin. If you want a more think-y game, then you might like this better.

It is hard to describe why this game is so fun ... but it is. You need to closely observe what your opponent is doing. Every card you play is important ... esspecially those you do not want to play. 

Fun theme as well and it works quite well as "play with your wife" game.

Awesome game.  Quick to play but quite deep as well, with some interesting decisions.  I prefer the Schotten-Totten rules (no 10s, 6-card hand) to Battle Line's; the game feels tighter with tougher decisions.  Haven't used the Tactics cards yet but will give those a try soon.

Haven't played with the special cards, but the base game is very good.  Not really a game my wife enjoys, and seems to be something that is too light for gamers, but I personally enjoy it even if no one wants to play.

Fun, light card game. I prefer this to Battle Line, as the leaders in Battle Line added too much chaos to what should be a quick, breezy game of risk management and situational assessment. Very enjoyable.

Quite cerebral, and the theme is of course pasted on. Worth playing, though, and better than rummy (which it seems to be based on). Best played with someone of a similar skill level. Tactics cards are rubbish- never play with them.

Although I'm not a fan of 2-player only games, I did find Schotten Totten to be fairly enjoyable regardless.  Played without the special cards, I like how your choices is constantly changing due to what's on the table and what you have just drawn.  There is a bit of bluffing as well as a sense of pressing your luck involved.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the rule to claiming a stone and how you have to logically prove that it is unwinnable by your opponent.  It always seem so disruptive and takes me out of the game.

In common with Lost Cities, Schotten Totten torments the two players by usually requiring them to commit to battles (or expeditions in the case of Lost Cities) before they're ready to.  In ways, it's more agonizing in Schotten Totten, because players are in direct competition to do better than each other at each of the nine stones.  Since the game can be won not only by force, winning the majority of the battles for stones, but also strategically, by winning three adjacent stones' battles, the decision of how to play your nine parallel 3-card poker hands gets still more interesting as you attempt to lure your opponent's strong formations away from the three adjacent stones you'd like to take - while you can't know what troops you'll drum up to send in, other than the ones already before you in your hand.  In summation, quick fun, with tricky speculation every turn.  This is a two-player game that is always fun to play.

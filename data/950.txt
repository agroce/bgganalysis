Four Dragons version. This is a great 4 player game - 2 teams. Very much like euchre but with the added bonus of card swapping to balance out the luck of the card draws. This comes with a player aid, very useful. In a trick, you cannot play a color already in play (red, yellow, blue) and a black card cannot be played after a flood. The goal is to capture Earth + Rain pairs to score one point each set. If a scoring card is captured, the player to the right of the winner randomly selects a card from the winner's hand and chooses which card to give back. At first, I thought there was nothing special about this game, and the artwork is campy.  After reviewing Mu and Lots More, I realize that Four Dragons is fairly solid in comparison.

Something new under the trick-taking sun.  As someone who is defeated by the simplest card counting, I really appreciate how all played cards are left on display.  The special powers cards are fun.  The play is challenging.  The one drawback for me is that it really only plays well as a four-player partnership game.  I own the Four Dragons edition.

Wow. A pretty opaque parternship trick-taking game that needs good communication between partners. Extremely difficult to figure out what to lead. The cards already taken in a round are arranged to one side face-up so that everyone can see them, otherwise play would be even harder.

Not my favorite, but I'd like to play it some more, too.

RATING: 6
I finally got the original version, long out of print, and at a bargain price, too. Both plays logged here are for the Four Dragons version, which I doubt will hit the table again.

This game is an odd duck, a partnership trick-taking game with bizarre rules. Collect food to feed the dearly departed on the four days of the dead. A lot of fun and, in it's original incarnation, an intriguing and original theme.

Skulls version.  Played a three player game, and I think it would play better with more.

Tags: 3rdTier, Tricks, UniqueA very unusual trick game, and a good change of pace.  The Jolly Roger version has a good theme and good art, if a rather wishwashy background story.  This is one of the very few trick-taking games that I like, as I usually go more for rummy-style and/or go-out games.

RATING: 5.5
BASIC GAME = An odd trick-taking game. I was annoyed by the randomness in the card exchanges after someone wins a "scoring" card, but I suppose that the exchanges are helpful (and strategic) because they give you information about your opponent's hand.  There seem to be too few options on a turn since there are only 4 suits and you often are forced to play something that you don't want to play.  In this sense, it feels like the game is playing you (grrr!!).

ADVANCED GAME = unplayed.

RATING: 5
Interesting trick-taking game with a lot to get your head around.  Some intricate strategies develop around the mechanics of the game (i.e., only one card of each color able to be played, 3's cancelling 10's, etc.).  Overall, though, I find the standard card games (spades, pinochle, etc.) more enjoyable.

By way of disclaimer, I know/game with the designer but regardless of that, this is simply a terrific game and one of the best trick taking games money can buy.  I love the set collection aspect of it, I love the gifting of cards, I love the special cards that add a little extra deviousness to the strategies, and I love the Day of the Dead theme (in the original version, although the art is quite nice in the new edition Four Dragons).  Highly recommended for card players both casual and serious.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: The art on Four Dragons is more attractive, but the layout for Dia De Los Muertos is more functional.

Experience: Mind-bending trick-taking, like I like them. Lots of wonky special powers, together with the gift exchange rules, keeps a lot of uncertainty. We've played with face-down cards out of play, which does make it really hard to know what has been played from such a non-standard deck.

Trick taking game with some interesting twists such as forced playing out of suit, scoring only for certain pairs of cards and lots of card swapping. But the card swapping and action cards bothered me. There seemed to be way to much of it such that game play was rather chaotic with cards swapping, being cancelled, etc. Planning how to play your hand became an exercise in futility.

I left the game completely befuddled about how to play this one well, and with a cavalcade of good trick takers out there that's a fair disadvantage. Four Dragons does scratch that partnership itch and do some pretty interesting things for a trick taker though.

I'm glad we got to play it! It was a bit convoluted at first, as the rules are somewhat poorly written. However, once we got the feel of it the play got smooth. There were some tough choices to make, and the balance of high rank cards vs. action cards was neat. The art was super awesome! A nice variant of the trick-taking genre, and not a bad card game to have around.

First played January 16th 2008. Taught ~5min, played in ~30min. Played as 4 Dragons. This partner trick-taking game is't for everyone. I found it confusing and filled with more luck than strategy. Each player is dealt a hand of 8 cards and you play 3 rounds. The deck has four colors blue, red, yellow, and black. Dragons in each color (not black) number 3,5,7,8. There is also a black 3 and 3 black 10's. The 3's also cancel any opponent 10. 3 rain (black, value 2) and 4 earth (red, value 4) cards are added to each hand. There is 1-six value starting card and 4-one value swap (with your partner; they give you one back; may be your card) card cards. Other special black cards with zero value are: 1-flood (causes winer to have card drawn from their hand and rain card can't be played), 1-ask (question where response is yes/no/number) and 2-choose (pick color) cards. Once a color is played, that color can't be played again in the hand. High card take the trick. The object is to take a rain/earth cards in pairs and are equal 1 pt each pair. The most pairs wins! Ties goe to most rain cards. I don't recommend this game.

Four Dragons (originally called Dia de los Muertos) is an interesting trick-taking game. It's biggest contribution to the genre is the way that players mostly play different suits rather than the same one. It also provides some interesting methods to communicate information to one's partner and cleverly doesn't really on memorization as all played cards are public knowledge.

The limitation of being primarily a four-player game does make it a bit hard to get it to the table. And while the game is easy to teach, it seems like a game that is hard to master. I feel it will take many plays to make it seem less random than it currently does.

As is, it's a fun, light card game that likely has some hidden depth. I could see my rating go up for it in the near future as I play it more.

RATING: 4
There are a few interesting mechanics in there, but the scoring is just too slow, at least make regular takes worth something. Else, the fact you exchange a card after each "victory" hand is just long, annoying and breaks the flow of the game.

The few pro is the fact that you must play different colors instead of following suits.  The fact that some point cards are also of a color will complexify some hands. There is also a few special abilities that are interesting, but it's overwhelming the first time you play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a trick-taking game where you try to capture matching sets of Rain and Earth cards.  How the cards in hand change between players during (a "swap") and after tricks (an "exchange") is intriguing and could be tricky to follow.  The Rain cards are more important to capture but are less plentiful than the Earth cards are and thus should somewhat be the focus of strategy, if not just to block your opponents from having them.

Based on the Mexican Day of the Dead celebrations, a partnership game where players attempt to collect food and Meurtos cards. Deck has four colors, once you play a color, rule is you cannot play that same color. The four suits have non-uniform values of numbers. Some unique artwork, not well received in the gaming group. As partnership trick taking games go, sure there are some novel aspects, but compared to all the others out there, does nothing to shine above the rest. Sold the game after a few playings, but I don't mind it.

I play the version of this game that is 'Four Dragons'.  I am a sucker for team trick-taking games, but for some reason this one is not my favorite.  I think the scoring and card play is a bit strange, so explaining to new people is a bit of a problem.  

There are also times where you still have 4 cards left in your hand, realize that there are point cards out there, and have NOTHING to do about winning them.  You play the next four hands hoping you were wrong, but inevitably, you watch as the score cards get won by your opposition completely hopeless and frustrated.  There is something to say about a game where you are constantly re-evaluating what you could have done better, but it still does not sit right with me in this one.

Even with these two gripes I still enjoy this game and would not turn it down if that is what the group was interested in playing.

It's a quite original trick-taking game.

There seems to be depth for only 32 cards, but the same ‘what the hell do I play here’ feeling that Sticheln provides slows the game way down as every card played is important. With only 8 tricks, it’s difficult to determine what your partner has and to construct good ‘partner’ plays in time - without the SWAP cards, more so. Planning for and winning score cards absolutely depends on what your partner can play however. This ‘partner luck’ is perhaps the reason it doesn’t come out more.

An orignal but strange trick taking game where you are trying to make sets of two specific cards to gain points and all other cards are worth nothing. You play in teams and can swap cards with your teammates and force a trade with your opponents. There is some control but often you are left with only one choice and leading the trick is not beneficial. You need to thus manage your hand and use the swapping or stealing mechanic to get a slight edge.

Quite weird trick-taking game with partnership and many many cards of varying actions. If you happen to learn the cards, it will definitely take a while to learn a proper use of them.
Some are pretty nice inventions, like the "ask" or "cancel 10"-cards. Also I don't like the exchange rule when you win an earth or a fire card from a trick. 

A little bit too weird to my taste.

[These comments are for Four Dragons; I have not played Dia de los Muertos, so I don't know how different it is.]

This is probably one of the worst trick taking games. Incredibly random -- this is a total waste of time. Here is how to use a regular deck of cards to create your own game of Four Dragons: start with the game of Spades (but Spades is not the trump suit) add your own twisted, counter intuitive, and random rules (make sure to include: you can not follow suit; 3's cancel out the opponent's Aces; the only way to win points is to collect sets of 2's and 7's; and any time you play an Ace, you can swap a card with your partner) and you will end up with a better game than FD.

Play Spades, play Hearts, play almost any other card game but not this. In case you haven't noticed, the only "10" for this game on BGG is from the designer himself! (As of Feb. 2005).
Update 07/23/2005:  I was looking at the GeekList below and noticed somebody gave this game a questionable '10' so that "Well, I'll go change mine so he isn't alone."  For explanation see the GeekList below, under this game's entry.

This game is sweet.  Almost every card play offers an opportunity for skillful play.  I like trick-taking games a lot, but even the best of them usually have many "automatic" plays, and this game really doesn't have any to speak of.  It's a tense affair that often goes down to the wire, and the team that wins is going to be the one that plays better.

Both versions owned, but I've only played with the Four Dragons version.

October 2016: Finally played this with players who know how to play trick taking games (those who have no experience with trick taking games will find this very random)

Most original trick taking game ever! Scratches the same strategic itch as the very best trick taking games by adding incredibly powerful rules and cards that counter-balance each other incredibly well.

Players do not follow suit; instead a trick may contain at most one card per suit, except for one suit. This one suit, though contains most of the cards that give special powers. This gives players much more control over what cards they may play, but limits the amount of information players can deduce from opponents' hands. Thus, the game adds cards that enable players to exchange cards or ask a question about a player's hand.

When a player wins a trick that contains one of more scoring card, that player is forced to randomly exchange a card. Some think this adds too much randomness, but considering how powerful some cards are in this game (and how feeble and weak the scoring cards are), I think this cleverly balances the game out!

Scoring is very streamlined; no need for pencil or paper. In each of the three rounds, players add seven scoring cards to the deck. Scoring cards won are kept from round to round.

Interesting game that's not bad, but nothing overly special about it either. Luck of the cards seems hard to overcome without any bidding mechanism. Once clever play has been sorted out the game should for the most part be in the luck of the deal.

I have a feeling that this game is going to grow on me, but in the meantime I am still a bit skeptical.  There is a ton of stuff piled onto this game.  I think it works, but upon first playing I feel that people can become overwhelmed.  There is a lot to take into account, which perhaps might add to the depth of the game.  

The only thing that I'm really not sure about is the gift exchange.  I think this might be to even out the hands a bit, but I think it might be a little too random for me (when getting good cards, and playing your bad cards well is already tough when trying to beat the odds).

Overall though the theme is fantastic and the art is beautiful.  I'm glad I got this before it went out of print.

1 play, 4er, Four Dragons version.

Very intricate, convoluted trick-taking game. It's main distinguishing features:
- 7 score cards are shuffled into the deck each hand (3 Rain, 4 Earth); collecting matched sets is the ONLY way to score points -- other cards are totally worthless
- very odd card color/number distribution
- most cards have a special power
- lots of card swapping happening (Swap with partner if you play a Swap card, Forced Exchange with right-hand opponent if you win a score card or a 0-Flood card in the trick) so even if you figure out what's in someone's hand, it may not be there later!
- no color may be played twice in a hand, except black; so especially later in the hand, there may be a lot of forced plays
- all cards played in a hand are on public display (no memory required!)

The game _begins_ to make some sense after a few hands. But there are only 3 hands per game, so you should probably play a few games! It's certainly interesting, although I'm not quite sure it's worth the effort to learn? That is, it seems like playing it could be fun, but I don't know if I want to invest the time to learn it. Cosmic Eidex, for example, is similarly convoluted but you can at least learn that in stages!

Will hopefully get to try it again, although given the pace at which we get new games that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.

This is a solid trick-taking game with lots to think about with each play.  Although there are some special rules and 'action' cards, the game is in no way complex--it is however "thinky."  We played the original Dia De Los Muertos rules, and were fine with it, although perhaps the swap rules from 4 dragons might slightly lessen the randomness.  If you enjoy trick-taking games, you've got to find a copy to add to your collection.

RATING: 7.5
[JRG 'Four Dragons' 2004 edition] {China mythology; trick-taking, partnership,; optimal 4p} Four Dragons is a unique trick-taking game. Most cards have special function, which makes the game very dynamic and tactical.  Control of card play is strong with function cards and suit-following rule.  Players convey information by explicitly asking questions and the answer is known to all players.  So, players should carefully choose their wording lest they will leak important information to their opponents.  Good partnership really helps - a team of better cooperation has much better chance of winning.

The illustration of the card is stunning.  The reference card is very important; otherwise, it is very difficult to memorize the function of each card and their distribution. 

This is an excellent game from first-time designer.  Looking forward to more his new games.

Played 3+ times.  It's quite engaging.  There's a lot going on and plenty of opportunity for clever partnership play.  Our group really likes it but it will be a while before we know how to play well. *UPDATE* rating up to 8.5. This game is angst-filled and wonderful.  I love trying to wrap my mind around this game.  I can't believe how much fun we can have with so few cards. **UPDATE** This game definitely improves with age. 2006/09/07

Four dragons is a mind bending game, made harder by the varied number of each card in play. In practice, it isn't actually very many and is easy enough to follow after a few hands, but it means that this isn't a game you can very easily break out after a long time away from. The pairs of cards needed to score points are a nice touch.

A very original, interesting and unusual card game with some very unique mechanics. At its best, there's room for some very clever card play, and given the small hand sizes, experienced players can definitely manipulate things to their favor. However, it's also possible to get hands where no amount of clever will help and players (and teams) are simply very constrained in their options by what they're dealt. Overall. this tends to be challenging and worthwhile and those frustrating no-option hands are fairly infrequent.

I've got the Four Dragons version. I like the idea here, the partnership aspect and having to claim certain cards to get points. But having to randomly give cards to your opponents after winning certain tricks seems odd for this sort of game. You can't plan too far ahead because of this.

Not rating until I get more plays.

Remake of Dia de los Muertos.  The cards from that edition are a true work of art. This edition adds coins that give players extra questions.  I am interested in playing this, but my friends don't like partnership games much.

"Day of the Dead", later re-released as Four Dragons, I'm so glad to have found a copy of the original (I clipped the corners of the deck and it came out really nice!) Reminds me of Manny and Grim Fandango! My friends don't seem to like partnership games so I'm not sure how much play it will get, but I LOVE partnership games, so if anybody's interested....Also, see TICHU, FOUR DRAGONS, GANG OF FOUR, Whist and my new favorite: BRIDGE.

Like Schnappchen Jagd, this game is an odd blend of a set collection game and a trick-taking game.  It has some wonky characteristics that are hard to grasp at first glance, and if you're playing against experienced players, it's going to hurt you.  It has a hidden elegance, and encourages further plays to better your strategies.  Very impressive.

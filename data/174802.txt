From my comments on the Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supermouse/venom-assault-0/comments)

Charles S Mote Jr on February 18

I didn't see that it had come up but I asked a question about contingency plans regarding challenges over the IP and the response was that it was all worked out before the initial campaign - I suggested it should be included in the campaign info (perhaps the Challenges section) and that might still happen.

So not only spreading the word, but making it clear that there is zero chance of a hang-up over any IP challenges - it really is an homage to the leader in the genre and all of the relevant right's holders are ok with any similarities.

I agree the SG goals are a bit steep - as with any gaming campaigns this time of year, it may be suffering from the "paying holiday bills" effect.

I wouldn't typically be a fan of this genre or type of game, but the art is fantastic and the mechanics seem well thought out. I am impressed with the effort put in here and the positive reviews.

I'm really enjoying this game so far. My only complaint would be that it can slow down at times, due to the time you have to spend making your tactical decisions during the combat phase.

Co-op deckbuilder with a non-licensed G.I. Joe theme that was done really well. The art was great, the graphic design was mediocre but functional.  The game makes good use of dice for combat, so it is less "solvable puzzle" co-op and more tense "will I roll what I need here" co-op.

RATING: 7
Great use of a fantastic theme. The art is great and really brings the game to life. I love the tongue-in-cheek humor of the game and the nostalgia it brings with it.

I had my doubts about the use of dice for combat but it actually works well. Once you get your deck going you are going to have enough dice-manipulation abilities to make the fights interesting. Sometimes there is are a lot of abilities going of at the same time but never too overwhelming.

Cool mix of deck building, dice rolling and G.I. Joe! Full co-op allows each player to specialize their deck and choose which VENOM leader to attack. The missions are diverse and the effects as the track advances are interesting and force tough choices. Also plays well true solo, a huge bonus for me.

This game is incredible. Don't think I've been hooked into a game so quickly, if ever. So far it's fantastic and absolutely dripping with theme, tactical decisions, replayability and most of all... enjoyable experiences. And that's just mostly solo. Giving it an easy 9 to start off, but pretty sure it'll be a big 10 after I've played all the missions a few times.

This one is another that I'm on the fence about. I actually really enjoyed my plays of this and it has some unique elements to combining various types of cards and the best combat system I've seen in any deck-builder (just topping Nightfall) using a simple leader mechanic to generate dice for combat and powers.

However, due to the nature of the combat, the game can be a little long and there's not really much in the way of cooperation between players, so is probably best played solo. The various mission cards greatly change the style of play and global powers generate some interesting (although maybe imbalanced on occasion if you're unlucky) situations. I want to play this more, but find myself choosing other games ahead of it. So it's for trade at the moment, but only for the right games, not to just 'get-rid' of it.

After two games I'm loving the Action Force (GI Joe) theme, the art is great and fits really well, enjoy checking out the map, the deck building is unusual in that you can pare your deck every turn, though you won't always want to, and you can have as little as ten cards in your deck throughout the game.  The dice rolling adds tension, and the scenarios look to add great variability.  Runs quite long for what it is, but that could be just inexperience, and keeping track of global effects can be a bother, but I'm looking forward to playing again.

The first play through (solo) was ok.  I thought it would play much better with more players.  I was wrong.

I played this with my wife and because this game is so luck-driven (by rolling dice), she didn't do a single point of damage the entire game.  It wasn't fun at all.  Not only was it not fun, but if you can't defeat the enemies the game lasts [i]way[/i] too long.

One thing I found to be really cool is the variability of missions.  There was quite the replay value here with sooo many missions and enemies to experience.

If you enjoy the G.I. Joe(esque) theme and heavy dice rolling, you may enjoy this.  Otherwise, this is a hard pass.

I really enjoyed this game, but I fell like it is broken in some ways. 
Both times I've played this game, first 5 rounds we were getting devastated. The second five rounds, the tables flipped and we devastated the AI. That being said, I love it! I plan on buying any expansions too

Fairly typical deckbuilding with a clunky, luck-based "combat" system. No reason to play it over better games.

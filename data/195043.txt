I loved the original game and this adds four new characters along with an exciting new special monster mechanic and a very handy score track. I believe in  rating games in context of their category and this is a very fun, light game that's consistently enjoyable.   I do wish that they had kept the symbols consistent between games so that it was possible to mix and match. I know they wanted the icons to correspond to items in this game, but in that case, I think it would have been better to make the tiles dual-sided, with the other side featuring the original game's symbology for mixing and matching. And just having all the symbols on the player aids.

Great expansion/sequel. Adds the HP board, which is super helpful. Also adds that random monsters - which I love - and new characters, which are all cool and thematic.

Best of all - it still fits in one little box (barely).

Initial Impression: As a filler game, this game delivers. The artwork and component quality are excellent. The gameplay is light but there are a number of interesting choices. Bluffing and hidden information are important aspects of this game. Although I've only played the game with 4 people, I suspect that it would work best at 3-4 players.

Essentially more of the same compared to WttD and that's a good thing! In addition to four new adventurers, this edition adds six special monsters that have unusual abilities/strengths and you shuffle two in per game. It's a nice addition but doesn't drastically change how you play. It also comes with a nice little board and plastic piece to help track your health when going through the dungeon.

A very good little 2 player minigame (small box relatively short portable game). A good thing to carry around with you to burn 15 minutes or so while waiting for something. Unlike a lot of minigames, it's both simple to teach and has a lot of meaningful strategy. 

A big part of its appeal is the short playtime so it's very prone to overstaying its welcome when you add more players. If you want to play a game in 30-45 minutes timeframe there are better games out there but this is a very good portable game for 2 players.

I picked this up when I was first starting my deep dive into the hobby because I like swords and sorcery. I didn't really understand the concept at first, but when we got it to the table with someone who had played it before it suddenly made all of the sense in the world. It's a beautiful game of pressing your luck, where you constantly have to decide if making things harder for your friends is worth possibly getting stuck with the mess you've made yourself.

Vous vous souvenez de "Welcome to the dungeon" ? Un petit jeu minimaliste japonais, édité dans la gamme "P'tite boîte IELLO", où il fallait rentrer avec son héros et ses équipements dans un donjon rempli de monstres, et espérer survivre ? Et bien, Welcome Back to the Dungeon, c'est EXACTEMENT la même chose. Au moins, vous n'aurez pas à apprendre de nouvelles règles. On a de nouveaux héros, de nouveaux monstres et quelques cartes bonus qui viennent pimenter la visite du donjon. Rappelez vous, n'entrez pas dans un donjon tout nu ! Déjà, vous auriez froid et ensuite ... ben ...

RATING: 4
The rules overhead of learning the characters and special monsters make it hard to internalize the odds on your first play. After multiple plays, it would be more exciting when you can intuitively feel the risks you're taking. Also, with four players, you know a lot less about the dungeon deck. It seems more exciting when you know more about the deck. Finally, player elimination is a drag. Those three things—the rules overhead, being more exciting with fewer players, and player elimination—work against the party-game style. I would rather play a simpler bluffing game like Cockroach Poker or Skull.

A great sister game to Welcome to the Dungeon. The Special Monsters nicely add to the bluffing and the Adventurers have some interesting equipment.

Bonus +0.5 for the Health Point Board.

Welcome to the Dungeon with some slight nuances and new characters and special boss monsters.  If you like Welcome to the Dungeon this adds a bit more variety and a slight bit more luck with the bosses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The new monsters are really interesting.
I like the vampire especially which is a standard monster if you do not yet have a trophy but doubles in size if you do. It also makes for more interesting decisions as several of the monsters interact with the equipment you have.

The health tracker is awesome... should have been included in the first version too.

[b]Bard:[/b] lots of damage reduction and emphasis on odd/ even monsters makes this a little trickier to keep track of than some of the other characters, but makes for interesting games as you are never sure when/if you need to bail out.
[b]Ninja:[/b] currently unplayed
[b]Necromancer:[/b] The necromancer takes lots of punches in the face and gains lots of health back, which makes it interesting in a push your luck way as not only do you have the standard push your luck aspects of welcome to the dungeon but you also are quite dependant upon the order in which you face cards in the dungeon making the necromancer hard to predict
[b]Princess:[/b] ohh this one is interesting as she is very small and squishy but some of her equipment is V powerful. This  makes calculating whether you can push your luck just a bit further quite the challenge. Princess either walks easily through the dungeon or is smushed to paste a very quickly :)

I was very nervous going into this game.  Its box is okay looking, the premise is simple and I'm always skeptical that a game with so few pieces is just a cash grab.  

The game play is quick, it has a lot of aspects to it, and I loved it.  Will add additional comments after a few more play throughs.

Plays very quickly. Simple as can be. Take a card, put it in the dungeon or throw it a away with an item. 

Fun things:
- Having secret information
- Push your luck/Bravery
- Interactive...if I pass you have to go into the dungeon. 
- Fun combos of items. 

Could be more deep if you had cards on your hand and played on each turn. 
Could be simulaneous then also if all played a card (or played a pass)...but who gets to go if all pass? 

A great simple fun game that all should have in their collection as a filler or to play with non gamers. Me and my 5 year old both enjoy it...and he beat me ini the first game.

The special monsters add a lot more randomness to the game when compared to Welcome to the Dungeon. For most games more randomness is a bad thing, but for this game it adds a bit more tension and surprise, which I think was needed! It's supposed to be a quick, light game and added randomness helps with that. 

The new characters are all very unique and flavourful, they're harder and more random but more fun to play with. Overall, I see no reason to play the old version, except for maybe the mage character.

There is one good thing about this game: it's the cure to insomnia.

Have to play it with more players, because with 2 players it is the most boring game I ever played in my life. The rules are messy - you have to keep figuring out what to do - that right there is a mood killer.

I even thought I was doing something wrong but after watching a few reviews and game plays, nope, I was doing everything right. This game just sucks for 2 players.

I will say this, though: the print components of this game are amazing. Really good illustrations, cards and tiles and that's why it's getting a 3 instead of a 1.

EDIT: Tried playing with 4 players. No dice - at the second round people were so uninterested that they joyfully accepted to stop the game and play something else. Selling this game.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (January 2017)

Last year, I played Welcome to the Dungeon. It was a fun game, but it wasn’t for me so I sold it. This year I bought Welcome Back to the Dungeon because it was on sale and after playing it, my opinion remains the same.

The rules are very easy to teach you can do it under 3 minutes. Playtime is very variable, from 20 minutes (ok) to 60 minutes (way too long for what the game offers).

The art and components are very good. Love the theme.

The idea of the game is pretty neat and it is fun for a while, but then it becomes very repetitive so it bores me.

Gameplay remains the same, namely, you draw a card and either add it to the dungeon deck or you discard an equipment. In theory the game is very fun, but it loses the novelty quickly and becomes a boring affair. The decisions are very simple. 

This new edition of the game adds special monsters and a board to track health. I really like that you can mix the heroes from the previous set, that’s always welcomed!

Best with 3 players, the chaos and downtime are minimized this way.

The new heroes are very cool.

Bottom line, Welcome Back to the Dungeon is a good family game, but it is too simple for me. It takes way too long for what it offers. I will sell it ASAP. My desire to play it again is low.

Fell flat with my family. 

Oldest daughter, who likes bidding, bluffing and take-that games, didn't like the fantasy dungeon theme. She said that she would have liked the game if the theme was something like forest animals. 

My middle son, who loves fantasy and dungeon games, just did not like the bidding aspects of the game. He in general does not like bidding and bluffing games so not unexpected. 

My youngest son, in between my other children complaining about the game, managed to win -- so he thinks it's a great game!

Personally just haven't found my own groove with the game. Definitely not for everybody.

Its a nice push your luck game. I love the theme, I love bards, and its not a 10 because the theme isn't quite for everyone. Also its very fun with 2,3, or 4.

Hand management game. You need to count tge cards to try to go to tge dungeon and win. Small game. Hard to win. Try to screw other  people, and tge easiest thing to do is just simply take a bunch of cards and not to go to the dungeon. The game ends you'll not win but neither your friends.

This is the same game and so same comment as the base game (which I've repeated below), but adding the observation that the new skill sets are good and interesting, and that the dungeon runs are longer (and therefore also more interesting) because there are more possibilities for negating bad cards, so it's a slight improvement on the original. 

I could easily see this getting a decent amount of replay. The game consists of just one decision each turn: If I draw a monster, can I add it to the dungeon safely because if everyone passes, there are enough skill tiles available for me to kill all the monsters in the dungeon, or can I remove a skill tile and still get through the dungeon if everyone then passes. As you have no idea what monsters the other players have added to the dungeon, it's basically guesswork. But at least it's fun guesswork. The start provides you the freedom to do things like use a low monster to kill off the best skill tile (with the intention of passing quickly), or putting in a low monster with the intention of staying in, and similar options with high monsters, and these different approaches provide most of the interest in the game, together with different sets of skill tiles to assess each round. The biggest downside, which stops it being a purchase for me, is the player elimination aspect - when you want an opener or a closer, you want to be inclusive, not have people watching and not participating. But otherwise, a fun time while you're in.

my kids really enjoy playing this (10 & 12).  When their friends come over, they love for me to bring it out after dinner and play a round.
The rules are easy to explain, but the kids usually get confused when I tell them they can have different strategies, and how they play depending on their strategy choice.  May just let them play it moving forward without the guidance.

RATING: 4
Simple card game, all about predicting the moves of your opponents. Looks great. So, the downsides: there's a bit advantage to memorizing the cards of the other players, there's quite some luck involved, rules are very unclear about some monsters. Especially the first points makes the game feel like a chore instead of something fun.

More of the same.  This is basically just like the first game, but more characters.  There is a bit of a twist with adding the special monsters, but nothing too new.

This is a stand-alone expansion.  You can't mix the games, but it holds up on it's own just fine.

The characters in this version seem a bit more specialized than in the base game.  It's still fun, but I like the characters from the base game slightly more.

Marginally better than its predecessor, but different enough that it is worth having both.  The weird monsters that get shuffled in give a bit more control over the dungeon that this version works better 3 player.  The prior one I thought was best at 2, because information about the dungeon got too spread out.

[IELLO 16 edition] {Dungeon; player-elimination; optional 3p} A simple dungeon crawling game, in which players have to sabotage other players to increase the difficulty of taking adventure.

This game requires a group of aggressive player in order to be fun.  Otherwise, the game will be too easy.

I am suspecting the replayability is low.  We should create more adventures to increase variety.  4 adventures with fixed set of equipment each one would be too static - all subject to the spawn of monsters.

Maybe, I don't need this game when I have Gauntlet of Fools :P

tl;dr: well, at least it's shorter then [thing=1927][/thing]!

This game has a nice push your luck element: do you screw up the round for others, running the risk of being the one screwed, or do you stay in, hoping the others don't screw it up for you, or do you drop out early but forfeit any chance of scoring?
Too bad the game after that is just very meh. I guess that push your luck element is the selling point of the game, but for me it wasn't enough. In the end, this is just another game where someone goes into a dungeon, and other players try to fuck it up for them. Like Munchkin. But shorter. At least they got that right.

Four more, very different heroes to choose between.

Very good, push your luck game. Clever mechanisms where each turn you have to pass or to stay in, make it harder by adding a monster to the dungeon or removing some of the hero adventurer's equipment; and attempts to win the game may fail and eliminate you from the game instead.

RATING: 7
The rating gets knocked down a point due to a sloppy and poorly translated rulebook (baffling language, inconsistent terminology) and an equipment discard mechanic that is neither fully explained nor properly understood (see [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1724218/hp-equipment-smoke-bomb-and-gelatinous-cube-again]this thread[/url]).  If you read the forums, you'll find that the Possession Scroll, the Gelatinous Cube, and the Smoke Bomb may or may not work the way you think they do.

If you're looking for ways to botch a game's ruleset/design, this is as good a place as any to start.

Despite my disappointment with the game's presentation and opacity, this stand-alone sequel is as fun as the original.  The randomly selected unique monsters and new hero abilities are solid.

Adds more heroes and different monsters. Some monsters are special and have unique effects and varying strength, which is a cool addition to the game - but it does take away from the accessibility of Welcome to the Dungeon. Standalone game but can probably be mixed with base Welcome to the Dungeon (though the monster card backs are different) to make more heroes available.

RATING: 5
Great artwork and has lots of nostalgia with looking at the pictures.  But i the end, with so much theme overlap in the Disney universe and limited scope compared to the entire (insert language) vocabulary, it ultimate is too narrow in scope and I'd much rather play vanilla Codenames with words.

RATING: 5.9
Not being a huge Disney buff, I can't say I appreciated this version of Codenames more than the base game. It's not about characters (in our game, I had a few cards of the same Disney characters on the table to choose from) but more about moments in the movies. Not knowing the movies that well by heart (nor some characters for that matter) I was kind of forced to go for colors present in the pictures on the cards (and that even was quite difficult since you could easily end up having blue being the main color on 60% of the cards in play). All in all, I can see how this version could hit the nerve of Disney enthousiasts, but personally I prefered the base version and its room for being creative with no prior knowledge of films etc. more engaging (even if I didn't really find this version bad by a long shot)

The theme definitely is great for families and children but that theme also really constrains the gameplay. The clues quickly get "samey" or fall in the same sorts of categories. Part of the greatness of original Codenames is the satisfaction you get when your team ties together 3 or 4 words off some clever clue. This version doesn't give you as many opportunities to be clever.

You can choose pictures or words or a mix. You should have no trouble coming up with clues regardless of your familiarity with Disney fare. However, two Disney adepts on the same team will be a killer combo.

RATING: 7
Least favorite compared with the original and pictures. I've seen a lot of Disney movies (because of my kids), but playing with the words is pointless since I don't know every character's name in every movie. Rating this a bit higher based on the kids enjoyment of it.

Disney Codenames has all of the same mechanics as Original/Picture Codenames. Due to this, I was expecting a comparable experience. Unfortunately, Disney Codenames falls short to its counterparts. The reason for this is because the cards/tiles in Disney Codenames are all very similar. Yes, the cards are from different movies, but they are all generally part of the same genre. One of the strengths of the original/picture codenames is the creative clues that can be used to connect cards/tiles that are seemingly unrelated. Disney Codenames does not offer the same type of creativity, thus creating less of these so called "moments" that we board gamers search for. If you have the option to buy Codenames/Pictures or Disney Codenames, select the former.

I am a big Disney fan, but I was a little worried when I first bought this out with my game group because a lot of them don't know Disney very well. But honestly it didn't matter much and everyone really enjoyed it. This was my first Codenames game and I liked it a lot. Many of our games really came down to the last round with everyone trying to come up with crazy clues and debating what should be picked.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2017)

I love Codenames, so I bought every edition I could find (I think I have them all). When I bought Codenames: Disney Family Edition I didn’t know what were the changes. Now I know, It is very similar to Codenames: Pictures.

This edition of the game continues to be very simple to explain (you can do it in less than 4 minutes. Playtime was higher for us because the topic made the game a lot harder (at least for us). There are many characters I haven’t seen before and even the ones I know, are hard to link as many are similar (princess for example). Still I like the game a lot.

It seems the game has a lower quality than others Codenames.

The art is pretty and colorful, I like it. The cards have an illustration on one side and the name of the character in the other, this limits replayability (as they offer half the usual content) AND it makes the game almost impossible to play for me if I don’t know the name of a character (this is very likely), with the pictures you at least can look for other ways to link the cards together.

It seems the game has a family variant in which you use a smaller grid. I understand why it’s there but I don’t think I will be playing with it. Besides that, it seems the rules didn’t change (I didn’t read the rulebook).

Bottom line, Codenames: Disney Family Edition is a great party game and a keeper for me. It is perfect for the family. This version of Codenames has been the hardest far for me as I’m not familiar with many Disney characters and many share a lot of attributes, I think I will be much more knowledgeable with the Marvel edition (which I hope to play soon). This themed version of the game does detract a bit from the creativity that other versions allowed, the reason, all the cards have already a theme so if you aren’t a Disney aficionado (like me) you are trying to link together characters you don’t really know, but this is a minor issue for me.

Great party game, if you're not a fan of Disney… Why are you even playing this game? They do a fun thing where there is a child's version of the game without creating a new child's game which is always for annoying especially if you want your siblings or children to play along.

Good version of the game.  With the pictures being Disney more people are aware of the subtle clues and there's a chance to get several cards per turn rather than give a clue for one card at a time.

I like Codenames a lot. In basically a year I've played over 60 times with tons of gamers, friends, family (including Grandparents!) and it has always been a hit. 

Sadly this version I didn't find very good. I did like the fact they provided both pictures and words out of the box, and do include a smaller grid option for children. But the fact that all cards are themed means making connections was much harder. Giving clues only works if you're reasonably confident the other players have the depth of Disney knowledge you do. Else they may simply not even really know anything about some of the cards. To me one of the brilliant parts of Codenames was how basically anyone could play it (well supposing they knew the language you were playing in). The Disney version will work great for those Disney aficionados but I fear that it will be fairly limited to those groups. The great framework is still there, but I think this may be too narrow and focused of a theme to pay off for most groups.

OK. So it's Codenames Pictures with all Disney images from their movies. I'm about 50% on how familiar I am with them. I'm not sure if that is what made it hard for me though. I knew most of the stuff on our grid and still had a ton of trouble coming up with clues. The real problem wasn't linking my cards, but not linking it to some others that weren't mine. That is likely why they have a family version with only a 4X4 grid, but we did the 5X5. I wonder how die hard Disney fans would do with this. However, they'd have to be giving the clues to Disney fans as well to really have the connection work. There are words on the back sides of the cards that actually describe the picture on the other side. That can help for the truly oblivious to Disney knowledge. All in all it's my least favorite version of Codenames so far. Marvel version is coming out soon and I doubt that will fair much better for me... I bet I know more Disney.

Because the images are much more focused than Codenames: Pictures, it makes it a lot easier to predict what people will guess from given clues ... but still enormous potential for miscommunication, which is the real fun of the game.

Words on one side and pictures on the other, but the word is just a description of the picture. Why limit gameplay like this? Similar issue to Deep Undercover -- cards are too similar to each other to facilitate creative gameplay.

I prefer this version of Codenames the most since its nostalgic and can be played with younger kids. The picture side is easier to identify as kids don't know all the words to the Disney characters.

Codename Pictures with a Disney theme. Doesn't do anything new to change the game works, it's merely a reskin, but more cards equals more things you can mix together for crazy word/pictures fields.

This version is better than Marvel because there are enough basic words like "door" and "pirate" to balance the game if you're not a massive Disney buff. I do think the quality in this version is poor, though.

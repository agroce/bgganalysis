Finally made it home this weekend to pick up the used copy I'd had shipped to my parents' house.  Played it last night for the first time, solo.  It blew me away, like I knew it would.  The copy I have is incomplete, but missing the most non-essential parts--two miniatures, 2 of the 115 room tiles, and all but one of the combat counters.  Luckily, the combat counters are just a complicated way of simulating Rock Paper Scissors and I have plenty of minis.  The two missing room tiles I'm not that concerned about.  Have played a few times with friends, and had a blast!  I need to start keeping session reports of my games.[update] Raised rating from 9 to 10--this game is certainly one of my all time favorites!  And it plays in under an hour!

I should type up an article about why I think Dungeonquest is one of the greatest games ever made.  I'll link to it when I finish it.

A 30 minute dungeon crawl made by the people who brought you the 'Horrible Black Void.' A wacky, fun, and highly amusing game that will kill you just when you get your hopes up. Pure Ameritrash.

I played this a lot as a teenager, some 20 years ago, and remember it fondly. Reviving it in adulthood wasn't a good experience. It feels dated, extremely random, harsh in its battering of the players, and the only fun to be had with it is to treat it lightly, laughing at the ridiculous sequence of unfortunate events DungeonQuest unrelentingly throws at the players.

Traded for Power Grid Factory Manager.

RATING: 6.5
It really looks fun. It sometimes plays fun. But you can die in less than 5 turns. That's not fun. Then you wait until everyone else finishes. Still, it screams good theme and is representative of the good quirky dungeon material of the 80's. And that's why I have it. But I really don't want to play it. But then again, sometimes I do.

Do you love unbeatable challenges? Well this isn't unbeatable, but close to it. A tough free for all, reveal as you go, dungeon crawl.

The game pulls no punches as your adventurer delves into its deadly depths. On top of this, a built in timer ensures you will be rushing to get out before nightfall.

Always a trip with my friends, this is one of our favorites.

Nostalgia. That's pretty much it. As an adult I tend towards games that don't involve randomness or at least games where the randomness is not the main part of the game. Here it is the absolute main part of it with just a brief glimpse of rock-paper-scissors. However having played the game as a child and spending so many fun hours on it makes sure it is part of my permanent collection. Even if it doesn't get to the table that often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I consider this game legendary, though I admit I have a soft spot for it in my early game purchasing youth. I envisage this game as a true-to-life rendition of how a dungeon invasion may proceed i.e. given that you are a mental-case adventurer going alone into a seriously dangerous castle, insanely near midnight (when the castle gets terminal for all visitors), populated by various unfriendly beasts and has a dragon in the middle, your chances of survival are low. Like, you may survive one game in five low. Therefore, one can often win by being the only one alive at the end (if, indeed, *anyone* is alive at the end). And how refreshing! I love this game because at any given point in your exploration, you may find a monster who wails on you, an explosion that kills you, a pit to fall down and die etc - and all with no warning. Exactly like lunatic dungeon invading should be.

This light game plays you, punishes you, and still manages to make it fun! I guess it's for the masochist dungeon crawler gamer in some of us ;-). The theme is a Roguelike dungeon crawler and it's so well executed, that the low player interaction is forgiveable. You have to push your luck through a deadly fantasy dungeon and accept that your character will probably not make it out alive. It's the journey that counts... if you do manage to avoid a lot of "YAAD" or "YASD", and exit the Dungeon with a good hoard, the feeling is grand.

LOL!!! What a zany ride that was. We played 3 2-player games. Got 1 tile away from escaping before I died in 1 game. That was the closest anyone got to "winning". Silly fun, but good from time to time. This gets me slightly interested in the FFG version.

This game is a classic dungeon crawl with the fabulous twist of having the dungeon unfurl tile by tile. (Like Carcassonne meets Heroquest.) It's a chaotic game that doesn't involve a lot of strategy, so it's not for gamers who need to be in control of their destiny.  We have a lot of fun with this one; we celebrate the victories and mourn the deaths together. And if you've played, then you know there are usually more deaths than victories.

RATING: 10
This one is a "love it or hate it"... well, I love it :D Survival rate below 15% as far as I am concerned, so this one is only for masochists. But I think this is one thing that makes this game so interesting, it really gives you this helpless feeling of what it's like to be lost in a deep dungeon without any hope. other games always give you the feeling that dungeoncrawling is like goin' down, grabbing all the loot, finding some magic items and bashing a bunch of weak monsters that come in your way... but thats not the case with this one, this one is really DOOM :D Even the potions you can find from time to time have only a 1/3 chance of actually healing you, and if you're out of look the unstable potion you thought to be a healing potion instantly kills you ;) Thats what Dungeonquest is like..

All luck with very little strategy.  I played this alot as a kid, and still break it out once in a while.  Getting out of the Dungeon is incredibly difficult, and is probably the most appealing aspect of the game.

RATING: 7
This game can be insanely hard to complete!  The shortest game I've played lasted about 5 minutes.  Death awaits around every corner and pushing your luck with the dragons tresure is really intense.  Overall, one of GW's better releases, but its a reprint from some Swedish game I think.  Be prepared to be frustrated as you die again and again.

A very lethal dungeon run. The game starts with a great deal of pressure on the players to perform, and perform quickly. The game is not bad, but not something that I'd request often, if ever.

A "go for the highest score" game where all you really care about is being able to make it to the dragon and back without dying. In this version most trap encounters are heavily weighted to characters with high agility. Combat is pretty much a modded rock paper scissors.

I was once very into this game, and I certainly have many good memories of playing with friends. I even customized it a fair amount and modified the rules.

DungeonQuest: The Wacky Game of Vicarious Suicide! You don't so much play it as watch it to see what  gruesome fate (probably) awaits your character.

One fix is to ignore the sun track or advance the marker via a die roll.

RATING: 6
An old fashioned dungeon crawl from Games Workshop. Coming out approximately at the same time as "Talisman," with which it is frequently compared, this game manages to incorporate some different ideas (tile laying vs roll and move), and a combat system where the other players get to take part. The game is very tough to survive and can be playable solo up through four players (this limit is more restrictive than "Talisman"). The bits are dated by modern standards but serviceable (I note that the recent re-issue of "Talisman" missed the opportunity to update their bits which are still no better).

Decent beer and pretzels game if you don't mind that you have about a 15% chance of survival (let alone winning). In that respect, it has some of the "doomed" feeling of "Space Hulk" (playing the Space Marine faction). I doubt I'll ever play it again as it has completely outlived its novelty.

RATING: 7
Rather random and chaotic, but you have to like a system where most of the time everyone dies. 

Particularly fun to enter the dragon's lair while your opponent is there just to wake up the dragon.

Heroes expansion helps re playability as you get more choices of character. Catacombs I didn't like - adds unnecessary complexity and decreasing the survival rate even further.

This game, which I know by its original name "Drakborgen", has much nostalgic value to me and I think the topic is very well integrated, but the game lacks substance and there are few interesting decisions. Very entertaining for children, but less so for adult gamers.

Very thematic but must be played with a "we're all going to die" attitude.  Rulebook is not organized like I wish it was -- hard for me to find things sometimes, and some things seem to be missing (for example, what do I do if I draw a corridor tile that leads to the edge of the board?).  Good for a play now and then.

Yes, I'll give it a ten.  I've been playing games since I was very young, and I don't think my friends and I have played a game more than this one.  It still gets played probably once for every 4 or 5 times we play a game, and we ALWAYS have fun.  Just a good example of a simple, luck-driven, fun game in which players try to beat the system more than agonize over strategic decisions.  I've got both the expansions, though - without the expansions, the game isn't nearly as fun.

Love this game. It´s always fun, fast and you never know if you´ll survive the next turn. It´s arguably the classic dungeon crawl. The old Games Workshop art is fantastic and especially with the expansions, there´s endless replayability. It´s as great solo as it is as a multiplayer game.

Absolutely based on luck with a smidge of tactics this is still a fun enough game to play. How far you press your luck and whether you make it out alive add a fun amount of tension to the game.

amusing beer & pretzels game I prefer over Talisman -- very
fixed time duration. Problem is that you might win from an 
easy dash in and out with a single piece of jewelry if 
everyone else dies to the dragon a few hours later...

RATING: 7
Great fun third outing though I didn't make it to the middle this time and my friend had unreasonable amounts of luck on his side as he not only avoided the dragon for 3 turns but also managed to escape while I was busy being sent in the wrong direction by rotating rooms. Now played this half a dozen times and while it's not exactly strategic it's always fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is exactly what I want in a dungeon-crawl - lots of luck, some control, and a really cool modular dungeon with great art.  Plus, it is tough.  Not as tough as those who bemoan its toughness would have you think, but still plenty hard.  There isn't a lot of thinking or strategy required in this game.  And this is fine by me, as most dungeon-crawls I've played fall into that chasm.  What redeems it is that it plays so quickly, and with so much narrative oomph.  Unlike Runebound (not technically a dungeon crawl, I know, but I haven't played Descent) this doesn't wear out its welcome, while still being good sloshy fun while one is inebriated.  Definitely deserving of a reprint, but I'm happy with the original copy I have, dog ears and all.

What is better than a game that you are guaranteed to lose nearly 75% of the time?

How about a root canal?

Actually, this is a very fun game, and was a "genre-buster" when it first arrived.  A great tile-laying game that will most likely kick your ass on a regular basis.

Oh, and this is NOT a politically correct game in that chances are, you will lose, and the game makes no qualms about it - no "touchy-feely" good results can come of this - this is standard ass-kicking Ameritrash.

Mindless, but pretty, non-co-op dungeon exploration game where every single tile has unique, usually irrelevant, art.  Set a new standard for fantasy game components at the time.  Can be finished in 90 minutes or less and simple rules, which can be a real plus depending on who you are playing with.   "Leap aside!"

But it is mindless.  Really much more interesting multiplayer fantasy games exist now.

I have this game on "indefinite loan" from a friend. It's pretty good. I think the death rate is one of the real charms and challenges of the game; you're not competing against the other players, you're competing against the game. In fact, it really lends an atmosphere tension and "us against them." The main drawback (to my mind) is all the extra pieces and cards. I usually forgoe playing with the Catacombs expansion.

A nice solo game, I played it for years... a lot of fun. A must have for solo players, but inferior to Arkham Horror.

You can play it cooperatively or against the others, but it is better solo. Why? Simple: you can really die in the first turn, and the game will be boring. And there is little interaction amongst the players.

There's two kinds of people in this world that play games- those who do so to have fun, laugh, and have a good time with friends and those who use games to vicariously live out a fantasy life in which all of their plans come to fruition, fortune never plays any kind of role, and everything happens efficiently and according to plan.  Dungeonquest is not for this latter group, and chances are I'll never play a game with you if you're in that group.  Y'all go play Caylus.  Still with me?  Dungeonquest is everything games are meant to be- atmospheric and fun, infinitely replayable and always dramatic.  Sure, it's tremendously random but so f&%king what?  I'd rather laugh my a$$ off after falling into the bottomless pit on the first turn than to sit through a humourless, soulless, mind-numbing efficiency exercise like Goa.  This game is brilliant, definitely the best dungeon crawl out there if only because it has really simple rules and generates a tremendous sense of atmosphere (and hopelessness) in a 30-45 minute play time.  The game looks absolutely gorgeous, as do all of GW's board games.  This is a true classic, definitely one that I'll be playing long after all the Euros in my collection have been Ebayed or traded away.

I don't really know how to rate this thing. Was it fun? Yeah, sure. Is it really much of a game? Not really. Is there anything there once the novelty wears off? Not really. Is the combat silly? Yes. There is no reason for the player playing the monster combat actions to EVER pick mighty blow, since by doing so affords the player their only possible advantage. There are a bunch of things like that which wouldn't get through modern game development processes at most publisher's I'm guessing. But it's a blast from the past, so it survives on nostalgia.

Quick, random, and fun.  I had to play about 10 times before I had a character make it out alive.  If you like the other Games Workshop games of this era you'll love this one too.  If you despise Talisman, or other games with many random elements, look elsewhere.  Although I own both expansions, I don't use the catacombs.  I sometimes add the amulets from this expansion.  Heroes is a better addition, but someof the characters have too many special rules and should only be introduced to an experience group.

Pointless, frustrating, and futile.  Mercilessly abuses the elegant rock-paper-scissors mechanic.  Even the worst dungeon crawl game you can think of is a work of genius compared to this mess.  No one wins.  No player interaction and do decisions to be made.  Simply awful.  UPDATE.  Watched the new FFG version being played at Gencon and I had forgotten DQ's biggest sin: it is slow as hell.  God watching this was a bore.  Anything this utterly random and punishing should be brisk and not the tedious, cumbersome, and plodding chore it is.

Boy, have I played a lot of this one.  Grab a hero and enter a dungeon to try and pinch some treasure off the sleeping dragon.  Originally a Swedish game, this is a totally random dungeon hack that is huge fun.  Room tiles are randomly drawn and you plod your way through.  If you're lucky enough to reach the treasure room, you draw treasure tiles until you can't take it any more (ie. the dragon is about to wake and toast you).  Then you beat it out before the sun sets and the baddies come out to play.  Great fun and pointless :)  The rulebook admitting you have a 15% chance of surviving lets you know what you're in for...

oh my god what a waste. This Games Workshop loser takes the already unsuccessful "move-and-roll-the-dice-and-do-whatever-the-space-says" mechanism and adds some twists: you get hosed and die several times every game. Oh yeah, and it also includes a novel tile-laying mechanism for the dungeon tunnels that assures that you will never actually make it to the dragon's lair in the middle of the board and have any chance of winning. Lovely way to get-screwed-by-the-game-mechanism twice before even considering your opponents. For true masochists only.

Played it for the first time at this year's BGG.con. Very fun dungeon crawl mechanic and you'll never have the same crawl twice. You basically try to march to the center and scrape up some dragon gold without dying horribly. 

Likely you'll die horribly.

Player elimination may turn some off, but there are some simple ways to keep dead heroes in the game, and the game doesn't usually last too long. 

First played 11/13 at BGG.con.

I have owned this since it was new (way back in the 80's..) and played it quite a bit. While my enthusiasm has cooled a bit, it is a fun game (fun to watch how the other players die..) if you don't take it too seriously (you will not survive most of the time..). This game gets requested in my current gaming group.

RATING: 7
A good game, but man, the cards are unhelpful at telling you how to resolve them.  A lot of referring to the rules is required at first.  However, the fear this game creates is awesome.  It's one of the few games where you're relieved rather than bored when a room is empty.  I find the combat mechanism tedious, however.  If it's going to be nearly totally random, just roll a die and be done with it.

Massive amount of luck.   You can die on turn one.   Or, if you are really lucky, you can escape the dungeon before time runs out.   Really cheesy and that's what makes it fun.   Yeah, there's not much strategy besides the obvious, but the variety of characters and possible happenstances gives it a lot of flavor.   It's just fun to see if you can get out alive, and that's about it.   Don't look for much more.

As an aside, this is especially good with kids.  It invokes their imagination, is filled with suspenseful life-or-death moments, is pretty non-confrontational, and has a memorable narrative.  Fun with a capital "F".

I love this game. You have to accept a few things going in to it. The rule book states you have about a 15% chance of survival. So it's similar to Ghost stories in that respect. You can die on your first turn if you draw a pit and roll badly. All these qualities actually sell it to me as a game experience. I like the Olympian challenge it offers. Its really just push your luck and knowledge of some of the probabilities that can help you through. I've played about 12 times and survived twice.

RATING: 8
Full to the brim with random punishment. The rulebook warns of a 15% chance of total death, and encourages counting cards to gain an advantage. Almost zero player interaction until players meet in the center and then block each others' exits, or challenge each other to lopsided rock-paper-scissors battles.

The winning move in this game truly is to not play. Or rather, take a few steps into the dungeon and then run like hell once you pick up a measly 50 gold pieces. The other guys likely won't survive, and then you'll be left the winner by default. But where's the fun in that? This game is about pushing your luck.

This is one of my favorite games. It's immensely fun to cheer on your little adventurer as he tries to open a fallen portcullis or escape from a death knight. Don't be disappointed when you lose--just start up a new game and try again.

My most satisfying game ever came when I made it to the dragon's lair but didn't have enough time to escape to the exits. I kept digging through the treasure pile and eventually found the spellbook (from the Catacombs expansion). On the final turn of the game I rolled the d12. A 1 would have meant instant death--but I rolled a 12, so I was transported out with all my treasures intact. An extremely swingy win--but very memorable.

I think every gamer needs to die in DungeonQuest at least once. And die you will, b/c the game is brutal. Wonderfully, wonderfully brutal. I love going into Dragonfire castle knowing that I will die and only wondering how it will be. I've died in just about every possible way in this game -- Bottomless Pit on the first turn(!), battle with a monster, trapped in a ceiling collapse as the sun goes down, flamed by the dragon, trapped against the dungeon wall by the rotating room, and one tile away as the sun goes down -- and loved every one of them.  And when you do make it out, you  appreciate it.  Life is precious!

It's really just filler material, and with all the set up, it's onerous for such a light experience, overly so even that I couldn't recommend it to many people, but I have a nostalgic soft spot for this one and with the right crowd it can be good for some laughs. Best to set up and plan on playing a couple times at least to justify the effort to bring it out as well as give everyone another chance, especially those eliminated early.

Note: I've yet to play the new version, I own the 1985 GW version.

This game was interesting for 2 turns and nosedived irrevocably as everyone died and the owner said "Wasn't that the coolest?"

No, it wasn't. Hard games are rewarding by virtue of the possibility of beating them, as are skilled opponents. Games that rely on random effects that are disconnected from choices made by the player are pointless time wasters.

Fantasy theme? Check! Plenty of mayhem and death? Check! Dungeon crawling with a high fatality rate? Check! Totally random and luck based? Check! Very few meaningful decisions? Check! Tons of fun with the right people? Check! One of my favorite games? CHECK!  I love this game: It's short, bloody, and roaringly good fun, even when you lose. It's a nice light hearted diversion from more serious fare. Not a brain burner by any stretch of the imagination. Dungeonquest succeeds at what it sets out to do: Provide some quick chaotic fun to satisfy my itch for a dungeon crawl. As a matter of fact, losing is rather cathartic. More than any other, this game has taught me to be a gracious winner, and a good loser.

Played 1 time. Mind you, I dies on the 6th turn (something about an ever-increasing band of snotlings), but it's hard to rate this too low, since I didn't have to do any of the onerous task of setting up. Basically a pure themed dungeon exploration game with tons of chits and markers and cards to make it realistic -- but a ton of setup not so fun when you die quickly. Near pure luck.

Gave away my old copy of this to Goodwill, but decided today to buy a new (and newer edition) copy of this from NWS.  Artwork on newer tiles looks like alot easier to see than on older tiles.

In addition to the astonishingly high death rate for an adventurer who tries to make it to the center of the board and back, this dungeon delving game also comes with all sorts of fiddly bits, individual decks of cards, and so forth, which is probably why I almost never bother to break it out.  It's not that I'm opposed to fiddly - see my high score for Arkham Horror - or that I mind the very high chances of dying - see my high score for Arkham Horror - but for some reason this rarely hits the table.

An Ameritrash classic for sure, but definitely dated.  The randomness of the adventure doesn't bother me so much.  It is in essence a push your luck game, after all.

A crazy ride that offers one of the most colourful experiential games I have played.  The rules state your chance of survival is minimal, but it is exactly this that makes Dungeonquest so much fun.  You know from the onset the odds are stacked against you, and chances you will survive or win (usually it goes hand in hand)  are slim, but the journey to your inevitable demise is a classic tale of blunder not plunder in this treasure grabbing dungeon crawler.  Games are quickly played, sometimes ending on your first turn. The ability o play solitaire is a bonus, but you will only be laughing with yourself.  The game play has little depth, but the tension created by the crazy odds, and the various means to your end make Dungeonquest an experience game that is always fun.

Lots of little cards and a semi long set-up, but this one is a lot of fun and very dangerous. Most of the time nobody will win and the dungeon will suck your bones dry. Lots of fun pushing your luck. Trying not to wake the dragon, while you steal his fortune, but look out if he wakes. Consider yourself lucky to even get to his lair.

Another BIG plus about this game is that it can be played solo also.

I LOVE this game and highly recommend this edition over the new 3rd edition, which changes a lot of the basic game play.

Another cracking game. I've used it to introduce a few people to gaming over recent months. Easy to pick up, no strategy involved and completely unfair (in my last play through I got stuck in a revolving room - game over withing 5 turns) but hilarious. 

The downside is that if you're playing with four players and someone dies within the first few turns they're a bit stuck, though it is entertaining to watch as people fall down pits and hulking barbarians get stopped in their tracks by small wooden doors... 

The reason it's a great introduction to new gamers is because it's so much fun. My cousin and my friend who had both only played Monopoly and the like loved it and now want to play more games.

This is another game I brought way back in the 80s, it was rather expensive for a kid, but it really does bring back memories.  At the time I liked Talisman's urban sprawl better, but if I had to choose between them now, I would rather play DungeonQuest.  It is short and brutal.  Setup up is reasonably quick if your cards were already separated in the box, but if not... you're in for a long setup.  I have tried the new version and I liked the old one better, the fighting is more intuitive in the old version and there are cooler creatures in the original version.

Crazy set-up time, especially for a game that can be as cruel and short as this.  A very lethal game, but quite fun.  My personal favorite dungeon crawler.  I sometimes miss the days of player elimination.  ;)

RATING: 5.5
It's a silly little substitute for a hack-n-slash style RPG session.  When played with players seeking to get a little monster bashing in it can be an ok experience.  It is not an RPG, it has very little strategy.  It is simply a way to take a trip into a fantasy dungeon and escape reality for a few minutes.

RATING: 2
Pros:
* Nice detailed components, even in my ancient version
* It's fun to draw the room cards because it adds a bit of uncertainty to where you are going
* The rock-paper-scissors battle system is fun and makes for a game where you don't feel cheated by luck in every battle
* It's over fairly quickly

Cons:
* The characters, while different on paper, feel mostly the same because you don't get to use your abilities enough. 
* The rock-paper-scissors battle system, while being pretty fair, doesn't take your strength, armor, luck etc into account.
* You don't get any rewards for killing monsters (other than still being alive) which for me feels wrong. And invariably makes one person complain about unlucky card draws. If one person keeps drawing loot cards and the others always draw monsters. There will be a feeling of unfairness that the ones who do all the "heroic" monster bashing don't have anything to show for it. While the guy who has all the dumb luck probably wins the game.
* I think the game gives an illusion of it being much more advanced than it really is. 


I'm admittedly a mechanic-before-theme guy, but I feel this game is a good example of where you don't have mechanics that support the theme, and this kills the game for me. If I get good mechanics but weak theme, I can always use my own imagination to fill in the blanks. But if it's the other way around I just feel that I'm watching a story unfold and I'm not invited to interact in a meaningful way.

I keep wanting the game to be more advanced than it is while playing. I think that you use your characters abilities far too little, and there is not enough interesting things to do. I just feel like It's too focused on luck and no feeling of progression or rewards. The combat system is moderately interesting, but again much too simplified. At least it moves along at a quick pace.

I enjoyed this on occassion but haven't played it now for quite some time.  Good enough dungeon crawl although I think many of my friends were discouraged by the high player-kill rate.

Excellent game if you don't mind losing.  A lot.  This is entirely based on solo plays, but this game has good components, great theme, and plenty of ways to push your luck (and get burned in the process).

A more elaborate but less satisfying version of the earlier game Sorceror's Cave.  Strictly multiplayer solitaire.  Recommended only for those who find Talisman to be "too strategic" or "not random enough." ;-)  Very fiddly in that there are zillions of types of cards and tokens such that the game takes nearly as long to set up / tear down as it does to play.

Is it a good game? Probably not. There's almost no interaction, it's very random, the strategy and tactics are limited, and yet, I have fond memories of playing it. (Some of that is certainly nostalgia.)

These sorts of games used to be referred to as "beer & pretzel" games, and for a good reason. They were about creating a relaxing, less challenging game with much emphasis on the story the playing created. The value of this should not be understated, particularly for dedicated "euro-gamers." I mean, I love El Grande and it is, no doubt, a better game, but I'll be damned if I can tell you much about any particular playing. DungeonQuest, on the other hand, excels at creating narrative -- I still remember the time I managed to find both the Sun and Moon artifacts in the dragon's lair and raced desperately for the exit only to have a portcullis drop shut just as the sun went down, sealing my doom.

RATING: 8
Swedish classic that I actually prefer in the Games Workshop edition, mostly because of the smaller and sturdier box. Slight problem with warped jigsaw boards in GW edition, but it can be fixed. The game is random and it´s extremely easy to die, but the theme and basic idea works. Love it. Very fast and relaxing when you´re in the mood for it. Traded for a GW edition.

UPDATE: Played with 4 and some characters from Dungeonquest Heroes. Fast and very enjoyable with laughter all around. Only one made it out alive... my Dwarf Berserker died one step from freedom. 

UPDATE. Played yet again with four characters. See my session report here:

Simple game... needs to have a big treasure card pile and another one for the rest.You would get big treasures when you take risks, and the small ones you could find them anywhere. Otherwise, the game can be quite frustrating when someone enters the dungeon, goes through a few tiles, finds a big treasure, exits and wins because all others didn't get anything worthwhile in the dragon's treasure or died.

The combat system is so much better in this version than in the Fantasy Flight one who takes forever to go through. :/

If it weren't for this, the FFG one would get 7.5

A nice dungeoncrawl in which the map is always different.  Combat could be frustrating with the rock/paper/scissors mechanic, and there was at least one instant kill trap (the bottomless pit?), but the game was a blast.  It was very rare to escape with any of the dragon's treasure, so the few times it happened were given legendary status.

RATING: 5
My only complaints are the lack of female characters and how luck plays too big of a role in the game.

However, this is an excellent non-cooperative dungeon crawl where each player is making their way to the center of the board and grab some treasure without waking the dragon. Your character must get to the center before 26 turns or the dragon wakes up and no one escapes. It is a more realistic dungeon crawl because a character can die in their first turn if the wrong tile is drawn.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Door Jammed Shut!  Dare-your-luck kind of adventure; do you dare try the Dragon's chamber for the big prizes, or are you content to sneak around the outside trying to pick up smaller items and avoid bottomless pits and the like?  Fun, if not complex- sounds a lot like this is a Diamant/Incan Gold precursor.
(Reasonably fun for Solo play as well)

OMG!  This game is terrible, and terribly fun.  I knew this game was gonna play me after reading the rules and in particular the following statement: "...After long experience and extensive testing, we know your character has about a 15% chance of survival...".  Yes, that is printed by the publisher, not a disenfranchised player.  The game itself is full of random events, few of which you have any control of.  Add to that a limit of 26 turns and several events that will simply kill you, thus ending your game, and ya...i think 15% is about right.  Even if all goes well, the odds of getting out of the dungeon before game end is near impossible.  After a bit of analysis, the only way to win this game is to do nothing.  Yes, your best bet is to go in, get a small treasure, then immediately leave.  This will most assuredly increase your odds of winning to about 50%.  Don't even attempt to find the treasure room.  it's too risky!!!!  There is a reason no one has entered this stronghold since its evil overlord died and he probably died while trying to escape that hell-hole himself.  
Yet, I see the value in the incredible challenge.  This game BEGS you to try and defeat it.  I have played video games with similar lack of playability that had tied me to the screen for hours because I HAD to know I could defeat it.  This game is essentially a basic version of Arkham Horror with fewer means for the game to take you down while you pretend you have a say in that outcome.  Get it and drink the cool-aid.

I won my first game by being the only survivor then escaping before dark with 60GP.

Fast, fun, frustrating, stupid, silly and basically perfect. Sublime challenge in the vein of board game Nethack where luck is your foe and you can die in one turn. A few of the bits in the GW version could use some modification (odd shaped cards?) and combat is thematic if a little dull (using the optional die table helps) but each round teaches you something and pursuit of the perfect game is addictive. Great solitaire game as well.

Ideal Players: 1-4

Description: Enter a maze of shifting passages in search of fame and treasure. Players must brave many dangers, and attempt to escape before sunset with the most gold.

Pro: Constant risk of death adds excitement. Complex and interesting strategy. Mechanics match theme perfectly. Every play tells a story of D&D style adventure.

Con: Characters tend to die, and there's not much to do after you're dead. Possible to game the system by getting a single gold piece and leaving the dungeon.

Wohoo!
Always a good time with this game. the luck factor is through the roof, but that's ok. It's the narrative that unfolds as your hero struggles in vain. We always played where each player had a team of three. With the massive body count this game quickly produces you should have no problem running through several times in a night. Sold this one with both expansions for a lot of $$$. For the price, I couldn't afford to keep it...Hopefully it'll be reprinted one day in English.

RATING: 7
I have played this game since the 80's. So many memories tied to this one! It is a fun game of competitive dungeoneering to get in and get out with the most treasure before the sun sets (about 25 turns or so). Each turn you decide where to go, draw a dungeon tile, draw a room tile, and then see what happens. In the center of the board is a slumbering dragon hoarding the most treasure. In an ideal game you find a path to the dragon and steal loot for a turn or two without waking him and then get out. 

However, most games don't go that way. The game is deadly and in my experience players only survive at about a 50% rate. This makes loitering about the entrance, searching for a trinket or two and getting out quickly a viable path to victory. This is the game's primary flaw (if you accept the inherent randomness of tile and card draws, which are plentiful). Ideally, the fun path should also be the path to win...  If everyone enters the game with the intent to shoot for the dragon instead of playing the odds for a win, then this is a super fun game. A little dated for my tastes now, but I have some great memories with this.

Dungeon Quest (or "Drachenhort" in German) is one of these little unknown gems GW put out in collaboration with a german partner company, that actually worked!

While it wasn't fair all of the time due to the randomized draw of the room tiles, how to deal with the situation the player encounters was all in that players hand. 

Would he open the closed door and potentially trigger a trap, or search for a secret passage way? Fight or flee from the ork she stumbled upon? Try to draw another two treasure cards and hope the dragon still keeps sleeping? Would greed prevail and kill him?

All while facing the dreadful time counter running down the timer and a sudden death when to slow to flee the castle!

Dungeon Quest is easy to access, tense, immersive and fun. It doesn't take too long to finish amd provides thanks to the randomised board and the rings plenty of replayability.

It's one of these classics that I could play over and over again.

I prefer Eurogames with a low luck factor but Drachenhort was good fun for me. My girlfriend didn't like it though as it was too negative for her although she's more of an experience gamer than I am. If you can't enjoy the experience, stay away. In terms of gameplay there's not much here.

RATING: 8
Completely random but also completely fun. Loved this one when it first came out and still every once and awhile bring it out. There is absolutely no strategy here, very few real choices but for some reason I like it. At the time I got my copy I had never played a game where everyone could die and there are no winners. I thought that was the coolest thing ever. Best experience - Had my sister play for the first time, we were using the heroes and the catacombs expansions, I die past mid-way, she makes into the treasure chamber, sun is almost down, she draws once getting much gold, she draws again getting the "book" rolls a 12 and teleports out of the dungeon with about 2 turns to go. She was hooked.

It's certainly a push-your-luck sort of game. What I dislike is that the risk of elimination is behind just about every decision. That dire threat hanging over every decision makes them all seem meaningless.

Oh, and I hate the combat resolution.

RATING: 6.5
A fun little dungeon romp which apparently players have only a 15% chance of surviving. Despite the light nature, the constant referring to the rulebook was quite tedious. Especially when you look up a card and it redirects you to a different section of the rules, that was annoying.

Also, the yellow arrows on the yellow tiles were REALLY hard to differentiate from the white arrows. Aside from that, I think once players get the hang of the different cards and tiles, this game will become really playable.

Significant shelf wear, it's an '80s game. One corner of box top split. Still holds game fine, box is sturdy. Missing a few parts (not terribly significant as far as gameplay goes), but also has some extra counters/cards from a separate expansion. To wit:

Has 114 of 115 room tiles.
Has 175 of 174 cards and 69 out of 68 counters.
Has three of seven conical markers (used on the time track, can substitute anything for them w/out affecting play)
Has 4 of 4 figurines, but 12 out of 4 character cards (the extra 8 seem to be from an expansion).
Has several other counters/cards from an expansion.
Both dice are there.
Rulebooks are intact. Pieces in excellent shape.

This is really a completely luck driven game but it tickles the right spot.  The exploration can be frustrating but it can also be quite funny to watch your guy go in completely wonky directions and end up at a complete dead end.  This is one of those games that winning isn't the goal.  It's to have fun and see if you can get absolutely anything out of the dungeon and survive to tell about it.

Just played this three times today. I'd been wanting this one since I first saw it on the FLGS shelf way back in the late 80's. Well, I'm kinda glad I didn't get it as I didn't really enjoy it all that much. I kept thinking 'this feels like wiz-war, but more random' which is something I didn't think possible. I felt the same way about Talisman, but I did enjoy Talisman a tad bit more (slightly more control over which direction you go). For me, I'd rather just stick with Wiz-War (more players too with the expansion) since it's in the same vein. I do love everything else about the game... art, theme, etc.

I got this off ebay, and my two kids love it.  Totally luck based, with a strong likelihood that all players will die in the dungeon.  I can tolerate it as a family game once in awhile, especially with some rules that make survival a bit more likely.  (With a group of adults, I'd recommend against this sort of variant -- seeing how everyone dies is the fun part in that case.)  (Rating based on: 10+ FTF plays)

I've never played a game where dying on the first turn is actually fun, but somehow Dungeonquest manages to pull it off.

When I first seen this game, I said to my self that it was totally stupid to suicide yourself in a dungeon. Then I reallise that it was pretty interesting.

The main draw back of this game is that all the rules are not referenced on the cards, so you must check the rule book everytime for every special card or tile.

Besides that, I like the game's idea.

I love this game but nobody else does. It's far too complicated to set up (do we really need 20 different stacks of cards?) and the combat system, while seemingly innovative at first, grows quickly tedious. There's also the matter of the absurd lethality of the game -- yes, if you walk one square into the dungeon and grab a 20gp gem, your best bet to win might be to just walk right back out. But there's something about it I just love.

Sometimes you need a game where it's reasonably likely you'll die on your first turn -- that's where Dungeonquest comes in. Totally bizarre and messy, yet somehow still fun to play.

Playing it is almost like saying, "OK, weird mechanics, I willingly surrender myself to you. Tell me what's going to happen, and tell me when it's done." Its appeal is difficult to quantify.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Superb game. Some may feel its too randomn but I love it that way. Its a fun game which is pretty deadly - if you get out at all you feel you've achieved something, let alone if you get to the treasure... Good replay value in that you can keep trying to better your highest score, or see how quickly you can get killed - I've seen a handful of characters get killed on the first turn!) - or even just see how inventive a set of circumstances are that lead you to getting killed...

The supplement with more characters is a must as the ones that come with the game are a bit bland. The catacombs is a good addition but the mechanism of finding out where you come up needs amending!

RATING: 5
(Drakborgen.) It's delightfully easy to die in this one, it's almost purely luck driven, and the player interaction is minuscule. The old version uses rock-paper-scissors to resolve combat, which I don't care for, but the newer version (with four stats) is even worse.

RATING: 10
OG badassery! The artwork is so good and so nostalgic, and the game is so tough...you think you're a badass? psh..this game has you beat by a mile. The original version is way harder than the Revised edition. I prefer this original edition due to the classic artwork, nostalgia, and difficulty. The Revised is easier to teach, and comes with better components, but nothing can beat the original. Coffin shaped cards, chalk outlined dead body shaped cards,incredible artwork. I actually rather liked the rock,paper,scissors battle mechanic in this one as well. This is ameritrash at its best. Perhaps the best game of all time for me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great fun as a beer n' pretzels type game for fantasy lovers. Little thinking or strategy involved beyond a little risk-vs-payoff decision making but it plays fast, has tons of variety, heaps of tension and constructs an engaging narrative. The icing on the cake here is the astonishing carnage factor - it's quite common for all the players to meet various gruesome ends during the game, leaving no winner - which alone makes it worth playing.

I just picked this one up on Ebay. I think a rating depends on what you're looking for -- I like it a lot, even though it's almost entirely dumb luck. It reminds me of the old cardgame,'War', in that respect. I'd love for someone to take large parts of this game and make it into more of a strategy game: perhaps have the combat involve more decisions, or maybe have the players play a selection of tiles from their hands, some of which could overrule their opponents' selection (a bit like 'Up Front'...)? Lovely tiles and cards. In any case, I'd rather play this with friends than something like Risk these days.

I have to admit I didn't appreciate it at first. Same goes with some of my gaming friends. But once you make friends with the fact that tactics don't matter at all on this one, this is just pure fun and simply thrilling because you could die on every move. This works here far better than in Talisman, cause the game only takes like 30-40 minutes to complete.

It must be noted, though, that in terms of atmosphere the German 1990's edition far surpasses both the Swedish original and FFG's remake. The game board, for instance, is held an a uniform black, and the rest of the art is also much darker. It just evokes the feeling of a daring descent into the deadly dangerous, dark depths of a dragon's dungeon that much better.

We had a great time playing this.  Totally random and deadly, but our deaths were hilarious!  Good to kill some time, talk with friends, and be horribly slaughtered.

RATING: 1
Ugh, I can't believe people actually played this. There are 26 turns to the game, and it takes 20 turns (if everything goes right) to go to the dragon cave and back. That is, assuming that your path (which you pick up randomly) doesn't lead you astray... and assuming that you actually survive the dragon, who can simply roast you if you pick (randomly) the wrong tile. And assuming that you are still alive all the nasty (random) encounters and survive the (/rock-paper-scissors) combat.
So basically there is nothing to winning this game except being extremely lucky. Takes about 45 minutes to play. Why not just roll a die and get it over with?

The original version of DQ that I played. Beautiful in its simplicity, this is the only game where dying is the intended way to play! 

A 16% survival rating means seeing the Dragon's chamber is rare and getting back out again even rarer! Talisman style artwork and simple, addictive play makes DQ one of the best beer and chips games ever.

I own the FFG 3rd edition now, but I fondly remember this version.

A very fun game, even if it plays much like a multiplayer solitaire. It's probably one of the best if not the best Fantasy board game I've played. It's fast, and everytime we play this we end up playing at least 3 or 4 games in a row to see the fate of our heroes...
Played solitaire it's a great game too, even if it misses a little the competitive aspect of playing multi.

RATING: 5
This game has little player interaction and the winner is mainly determined by luck. Yet, to enter the Dragon Castle where every tile is unknown and every room is a surprise is always a new and exciting challenge. 

Pros: Simple rules, short game sessions, new board in every new game
Cons: Little player interaction, chance important for outcome

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/795792/our-very-final-adventures-in-dragonfire-castle

Old school fun dungeon bash.  Dug it out again recently and had more fun with it than expected but even back in the day this was never one of my all time faves.  It has a certain deadly charm, but doesn't really give any kind of dungeon crawl experience.  It's more like flip a tile, bam, you're dead.  Which is okay up to a point.  Probably would have hit eBay if it wasn't for the FFG edition showing up and taking over the block.  Although I'm glad I didn't get the FFG version as the combat looks terrible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Yes I admit that my rating is way to high. But i have to many fond memories of this game (the swedish original version, that is), nothing like persuading the player next to you to use the amulet he just found only to have it blow up right in his face and instat deth, followed by hysterical laughter from around the table.

A game where 25% (a number we got from years of playing and writing down statistics) of the players survive, and death could come from one single bad draw or a bad dice is a GOOD game, or atleast a good game to play drunk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I only have the original swedish version: Drakborgen. A FABULOUS game!! Has everything: Lots of exploring (random room tiles) and random events make every game completely different from the other. Well balanced (pretty hard to make it in and out alive, that is) and a perfect game for 4 persons. Lots of rules, though, probably makes it hard for non-boardgamegeeks to play without stopping to look everything up: "lets see now.. was a a D10 or a D12?"

RATING: 5
Fun to play once in a while, if just for the amusement value of "you walk into a room and die" turns.  Very random, not much player interaction; however, lots of great bits, and winning this game is stangely satisfying, especially if multiple players escape and the win is decided by who stayed "in" the longest and amassed the most treasure.

RATING: 8
I'd bought this new when it was first released because it was published by Games Workshop.  At that stage (late 80's) I was really into Talisman and thought this game would be similar (because it had 'From the makers of Talisman' on it).  When I opened it and read the rules I just didn't like it.  It sat on my shelf for a few years, unplayed, until I finally sold it at a gaming convention for some cash to feed my role-playing hobby.  Fast forward to 2003 when I found BoardGameGeek and read some of the reviews.  I came to regret selling this game without giving it a chance.  Strangely enough, a month later, I happened upon a near-mint copy at a local flea market for AUD$5.00 (I've never seen another copy previously or since).  I immediately bought it.  Sadly, all the combat cards were missing.  However, thanks to a kind soul on BGG, I received a scanned copy of those cards and printed out new ones (good as new!).  I have only played this game solitaire and it always gives a tense, exciting game.  A solid rating of 8 for four reasons - 1. The game gives me the feeling of fantasy role-playing in a short playing time, 2. It has a high-replay factor (four different characters to choose from and a different layout every game), 3. There is tense decision-making (will I continue on or cut my losses and escape before the sun goes down), and 4. It is an excellent solitaire game.  Some people call this game luck-based and random.  I like to think of it this way - this is a pre-set dungeon your character is walking into.  You just don't know how deadly it will be or what's around the corner when you enter.  This is a game in which I always want to beat my previous score.  
UPDATE 12 May 2008 - Picked up a spare copy (missing a few tiles) in a math trade for my Sumo! Previous owner was Mr_Lunch.

Compaired to today's games, the mechanics are simple yet sollid. Sadly the game got lost over the years..,
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is almost all random chance and luck. Normally this would drive me up the wall but instead I absolutely love it.
When I was a kid playing this I didn't like it much and preferred playing Talisman. As an adult I love it. The main satisfaction of this game is watching your mates die ignominiously. Nothing beats seeing Sir Rohan stuck in a hole and unable to get out turn after turn (typically when this happens someone goes and changes the music to Down in a Hole by Alice in Chains just to rub it in) or seeing someone crushed to death by a cave in. You go into this game expecting to lose and occasionally come out alive.
I suggest keeping a tally of the best treasure halls so people feel compelled to try and beat the records when pilfering the Dragon's cache.
The main reason a game so dominated by luck is so fun is that it only takes a half hour or so to play and anyone can play with minimal instruction needed.
Another amusing part of the game is the rocks scissors paper duels with the monster cards. It is awesome when someone gets inside your head and continually beats you to death.
My group of mates also abide by the unwritten rule of drinking all potions immediately, or saving them for a victory drink when you are one tile away from escaping the dungeon with your loot. All corpses also have to be fondled and all crypts defiled.
Remember, the key to enjoying this game is schadenfreude.

Ps. Look out for the giant centipede you somehow didn't notice when first entering a room.

RATING: 6
(10+ plays) Beautifully produced and executed game.  Lots of variety in pieces, and mishaps which often prove fatal.  Way too much luck.  In fact, there is no discernable strategy whatsoever.  There is no time in the game where you can make a decision that will have anything other than random consequences.  Kind of a fun timewaster though.

RATING: 9
A difficult dungeon crawler with great looking pieces and miniatures. Like Talisman this game lives from finding new things and the thrill of seeing your hero fighting a horde of monster. In comparison, Dungeon Quest lacks the amount of things you can do in talisman and I personally don't like the time limit. There is less player to player interaction because different floors rarely cross each other

It's still a very good game, thumbs up!

This game is ridiculous.  It's almost entirely luck and the chances of survival are about 15%--but I love it!  I love going into the dungeon knowing I'm almost certainly going to die, and then seeing how long I can press my luck.  Three visits to the dragon?  Four?

This game has grown on me after many, many plays. Plus, it's solidly in the fantasy boardgame genre, so a big plus for our group. As long as the lethality is lowered (i.e. the sun-track ignored, at the very least) strangely it tends to appeal to non-gamers, too.

I own the original Drakborgen by Alga. I played it lots and lots as a teen 20 years ago, and absolutly loved it. I later bought "Drakborgen - Legenden" which is by far weaker and even smaller/shorter/lesser judging by tiles required to reach the goal. So now I have the original once again. Better in every aspect. It should be said that the expansion does alot for the game though. Every one of my friends and their spouses that tried it, have liked a couple of rounds so far.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a pretty standard 80s game with some interesting design mechanics. One thing to note is that this is a narrative style game rather than a more typical competitive style game. This means that no matter how much you play the game, you'll never really get any better at it. What happens to you just happens, and you don't just have a whole lot of control over it.

While that may not appeal to some people, I absolutely love the game, even when my character dies a horrible, painful death. You get a group of four players together who have a good sense of humor, and you'll be laughing the whole time as your characters suffer horrible fates in an attempt to snatch a handful of gold from the dragon. Then, our of nowhere, some player is going to be fantastically lucky and walk away with the entire dragon's hoard without a scratch. You'll all cheer his victory while secretly loathing his luck.

This game tells the tale of doomed adventurers on their impossible quest to rob a dragon in about an hour of tense, random, and horrible encounters that will kill your character. If that sounds like fun to you, pick up this game. You're going to love it.

RATING: 7.6
I played this solo and with two players and the game isn't so different as the solo version.  This is a pretty good game especially for its time.  if you like heroquest then I think this will be a good fit for you.  A lot of card draw so quite a bit of luck but it seems to be entertaining none the less.  The rock,scissor, paper combat actually seems to be better than one would expect initially.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Read a lot about this game and see it on e-bay a lot doing quite well for a game that is out of print for so long.  Finally got a copy and we played it several times.  I like the solo aspects, and the timed nature of the game (keeps it from running too long).  It's kind of fun when no one wins and everyone dies a horrible suddent death!!  Very fiddly, though, and that makes this one less likely to get pulled out and set up--it can take 5-10 minutes just to shuffle and establish the cards--for new or follow-up games.  Argh!

Fun, probably especially because of its near impossibility. I have this with the Catacombs expansion, and am increasingly of the opinion that it is better without (although the amulets are a nice addition). One deeply annoying feature is having to continually refer to the various Ryle books to find out the effect of a card - only to learn that it's "Take 1d12 - armour damage" - why couldn't they include this text on the cards. Keep meaning to take some fineline coloured markers to my cards sometime to rectify this.

This game was a lot of fun. Very random but I knew that going in. That's why I wanted to play it. This feels like a co-op or a solo game. Sometimes the game will just be unwinnable, but this one provides a really fun ride, and even though there's no relevance to other players actions (unless two of you make it out alive), the turns fly around the table fast and your opponents are always ready to laugh at your misfortune.

I played this several times as a kid. I remember dying a lot. There's a lot of dying and death in this game. Death dead der dying von deadness. Your chance of surviving the dungeon is so slim it's stupefyingly foolish to enter in the first place. So when you play, you have to imagine your character as some sort of psychopath with a death wish. And that's when some fun role-playing comes in. "Hey, why do you think people who enter that dungeon never return?" "Which dungeon?" "The one by the pit of stench." "Which pit of stench?" "The one  over there, by the pile of tangled maimed bodies." "Which pile, the pile of tangled dwarves or the pile of maimed elves?" "Just beyond the mix of the two, right in the center there, see?" "Hmm, I have no idea. Let's go inside and see." "Should we pack a lunch?" "Nah, I'm sure we'll find some food while we're in there, and maybe some weapons to fight with, too." "Yeah, that'd be sweet."

Fluffy lightweight random dungeoncrawler.  What makes it special is the ludicrously high failure rate and the perfectly judged game-length.  It ought to be possible to simplify the ludicrous number of different sorts of cards though.

RATING: 6
Probably one of the first tile laying games paving the way (haha!) for the next generation.  Is fun to play, but the game seemed slightly unbalanced to me and maybe didn't have enough playtesting to get the ratio's of tiles right.

That being said, this game has one of the most tense and exciting inter-player combat interactions which was why I always came back.

It is a fun family game. Nothing in it that would upset some families' religious views. On it's weak side somewhat luck based. Regular combat is like rock, paper siccors. It aint easy to get rich, it is hard get in and get out alive. Sometimes the player who gets out alive with a little will be the winner. My copy has seen a lot of play. (that was before BGG)

This is a great, light-hearted, fast-paced game that non-gamers can get into. Yes, it's almost like playing multiplayer solitaire and there's lots of randomness, but somehow it works. I think it's a study in how to make randomness fun, actually.

RATING: 5
I bought this at about the same time as Talisman, thinking it was along the same lines, but it never really grabbed me somehow.  I felt sort of detached from the goings-on, which was weird, because everyone I've ever played it with LOVED the game.  I just never got the attraction, which made me sad.  So I got rid of it. (The game, not the sadness) (Though getting rid of the game took care of the sadness, so I suppose I got rid of both -- how efficient of me!)

This was my first board game I played that had both random tile laying and a fantasy theme.  I've been hooked on both since then.  It's not a game for people who can not go with the flow of highly destructive randomness.  You're going to lose more often than not, but often times laughing at the absurdity of the stacked odds against success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
OK, first tile! Oh, it's a bottomless pit. Oh, I failed my dex check. Oh, I'm dead. This is honestly not far below an average performance for DungeonQuest, where the winner is not necessarily the person who escapes the dungeon with the most loot, but the person who simply died last.

The best dungeon-crawler ever (not counting its predecessor, Drakborgen)! I can't say I'm fond of Games Workshop's idea to set it in the Warhammer universe and give it an ugly artwork (the original was so much more gorgeous). And the odds: 15% chance of survival - I just love 80's games!

Sometimes game set up can be longer than the playtime...you can walk in and fall into a bottomless pit in the first turn!  Good for laughs, and a lot of tension and excitement towards the end as you race to escape.  Needs some house rules to keep someone from just sitting next to the entrance tower and winning by being the only survivor.

The big problem is the constant reference checking required and the utter inconsistency of the rules.

I have a lot of nostalgic memories of this game, most are of playing it a lunch breaks in the school library, I could probably trace my current love of games back to those sessions.

I was lucky to have picked up this in a charity shop in August 2009 while in Ipswitch, it was priced well as they had done there homework on it's value. No bargain for me I thought, but I had to have it and it was a good charity too so I passed over the cash.  Thus I was pleasantly surprised to find that the box also contained the heroes and catacombs expansions too :)

We've played a few games since, it's still fun but it doesn't fell like such a good game anymore as other games have used the risk mechanic so much more elegantly since,  I think I'd now rather play Inca Gold for my risky thrills.

Despite having very little in the way of strategy or tactics, DungeonQuest is so evocatively themed that I just don't care that it's unfair.  It's really about the story that unfolds as the adventurers make their way into the dungeon.  With four players looking to have a dungeon-romping, monster-bashing, treasure-searching, trap-falling-into, unbalanced, unfair, hilarious good time, this game is perfect.

Fantastic in its time, still decent as a beer & pretzel game today. Although almost completely luck-driven, it still feels like a challenge to survive the dragon's lair (with each session there is always someone who does not make it out before sunset).

Absolutely brilliant, even though it is completely luck-based. Seeing your friend die on the first turn is hilarious! With a 85% chance of failure we choose to play without the sun track - you usually still die anyway.

The only annoyance with this game (which I'm guessing has been addressed with the FFG re-release) is that the cards don't explain what they do, so if you forget you have to check the reference sheets. It'd be much easier if it was written on the cards themselves, but I guess that is just how it was done back then! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun but findishly hard dungeoncrawl game. It can be quiet funny as in the way the game plays it is possible, hell, nigh likely that you can die on your very 1st turn! A game track allowing no more than 24 turns gives a nice sense of impending doom and ensures games do not last too long, componants good (especioally for the year it was made) but not as sturdy as say modern FFG. If nothing else this game almost certainly makes me laugh, well worth finding a copy if you can.

I play it with the following changes:

- If you die by something else that going to 0 lives you simply lose 1 life and the next turn.
- Remove the dead end tiles from the game before starting to play.
- If a room closes your path into a loop you are allowed to choose a different entrance for the tile so instead of feeding the loop, it points to a new open space.
- when you kill a monster you are allowed to loot the corpse. Pick up and reveal a corpse card and deal with the effects.
- bottomless pit: makes you lose one turn but on the next one you move out of this tile.

The dungeon is challenging to survive, and that can be fun. But it can also lead to frustration if bad luck kills you just as you are about to win. I&#039;d rather play something less painful. Also, the components are nice but for so many cards there&#039;s not a lot of variety.

Love the theme, but this just plays itself, roll some dice, flip some tiles, but there are no tough decisions.

Funny game for the kids, but very hard to crawl out of this dungeon

[b]A GREAT LAUGH.[/b]

I've put this game through its paces mainly through solo play. I even developed a points system to grade how successful each character's forays were - multipliers against treasure found/removed/lost, etc. I was interested in which characters were the most useful.

DQ is hilariously brutal. It will kill you off without breaking into a sweat. And, it likes to do this as often as it damn well pleases!
I've had this since day one and it has never gotten enough table-time.
The artwork on all the cards - of which there is a shedload - and tokens, and board, is good. This game was produced with care and attention: a child of the 80's boardgame wonder years! Back in the days when GW actually gave a toss...

I own BOTH expansions.

A classic. Very difficult to win. Can be a lot of fun with the right group of players. "Leap Aside!"

A light-hearted dungeon crawl that is low on the complexity scale but high on the fun factor.  The complete randomness in which you may die one turn into the game or one step away from the win is definitely what makes the experience such a blast.  A big plus for the time counter that prevents it from overstaying its welcome.  This is a classic that has withstood the test of time (made over two decades ago) and lite enough to scratch the RPG itch without having to commit more than an hour or two.  Not bad at all.

An all time favourite. I must have played this game 500 times by now. Totally (almost) random, and that's what's fun with it. You'll be so abhorringly mashed by Dragon's Keep that you can't stop laughing. This older version is so downright mean that you'll be killed 90% of the times trying. Or more.

I like the original more than the FFG remake. They're very like, but the art was bland in the FFG version, and I didn't like the card distribution. I've recently put work into a personal remake, and am playing this game as always before.

Silly game of players competing against the system (and kinda each other). Pure randomness drags the game down.

A timeless classic.

I bought this game the first week it was released, and still play it to this day.

Great storyline possibilities.

Imagine Diamant with a fantasy theme and lots of special cards. A great game but of course it "suffers" a bit from it's age. At least it doesn't try to cover up that players can be eliminated during the game - but hey, never has player elimination been that much fun :D

1/1/12 -- Who knew, but even Dungeon Quest can get a little old after a while.  I haven't played it in a few years now, and I haven't looked to it lately when deciding what game to play, so I'm dropping my rating from 8 to 7.

09/06/06 - RATING 8:  I love this game.  You just wander around, hoping not do die, but, of course, you always do (and there's nothing you can do about it).

Its fun, but yeesh is it dangerous.  You've gotta be a nuts adventurer to wanna go into THAT dungeon  :)  The rules admit you have a mere 19% success rate - to be honest, I'm surprised its as much as that.  Still, its fun, and funny, and doesn't take all that long (especially if you fall into a bottomless pit on the first turn *grumble grumble*)

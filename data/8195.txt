A great kids game that is fun for adults too. It's a basic roll and move type game with a race element but there are some fine points that make it special. Simple rules, really great components and fun to play. A family favorite.

Fun kids game of running mice around and having them find cheeeeeeeeeeese before the cat eats 'em. (Yeah, I know the rules say the cat scares 'em, but look at that fat cat and tell me he hasn't eaten mice by the bucketful!) Adults should probably start the cat several spaces ahead of where the board says to.

RATING: 6
a luck based racing game.
It feels a little like pachisi or sorry.
You roll a dice, if you roll a number, move one of your mice that many spaces.  If you roll a cat, move the cat one space and a mouse one space.
If the cat overtakes mice, they die.
There are side paths you can kill your mice off into and gain victory points (cheese).
Ultimately, you want the most valuable cheese at the end of the track.  Neat mechanic for speeding up the cat.  Good kids game, but VERY luck heavy.

Love the nice wooden pieces! I like it that the game allows you the choice to play conservatively or to gamble a little bit with how many mice you bring out. It also lets you press your luck along the way with as you pass up the different safe spots. This game didn't get much play at first because my sons didn't like it. But my daughter is old enough to play now and she seems to like it quite a bit.

Viva Topo is a children game even a group of grown-ups can enjoy, because it’s easy, quick and even strategic to some degree: it’s unexpectedly fun as well, which makes it a great filler or finisher.
You roll a die and move your five mice, trying to get as much cheese as you can while taking an eye on the cat’s advances: sometimes it takes very little to make a very good game.

Best kids game out there IMO. Playable by all ages, with the older kids able to make more sophisticated choices, but 4 year olds seem to love it as well. And it's really just a solid game overall. Everybody loves the slow death march of the cat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like Gulo Gulo, Chicken Cha Cha, Loopin' Louie, etc. this is a game that is tolerable and even pleasant for adults. Its' a push your luck race around the track with mice in search of cheese, trying to outpace the cat.

At three, our daughter might not be quite ready to play this game strictly by the rules, but we're not far from that point either. It's a keeper for now as we try to develop a little gamer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad race game as you try to move your mice around the board before the cat catches you, but luck of the die certainly comes into play with how quickly the cat moves around the board. I played with my daughter and both of us got all of our mice home and the cat had barely made it around the board once. It was a little disappointing to not have a little more challenging decisions but I guess in other games we would be rolling a lot of 1s and moving the cat more. 

Finally another request for this one and this time the cat flew around the board and we barely made it half way around. A lot more fun, and a great 30 minute game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very fun and tense game of portfolio risk management. And it's a kids game! My first two plays were with my wife with the kids looking on. They were pulled away from the TV by our yelling. Boy does that cat start moving fast! I'm very curious to see how my daughter does when she actually tries it.

One play - another solid kids offering with great pieces.  Kind of like a blend of pachisi but with a push-your-luck element, since you can have your mouse exit early for a lesser prize.

RATING: 7
Great components.  Increasing my rating to a 7 -- during our first play we must have gotten lucky rolls because the cat never came close to catching any of us.  Subsequent plays involved much more tension as the cat caught some of us every time.  Fun game for the kids!  We like the risk management aspect --  do I advance my front-runners to try to get the big wheels of cheese thus potentially sacrificing my lagging mice, or do I move all my mice in a group trying to keep everyone ahead of the cat and settle for smaller pieces of cheese?  Recommended game for ages 4+.

RATING: 7
Great kids' game. Provides a pleasant amount of decision points that can impact the outcome, while remaining simple enough for a 4-year-old to play. The theme really makes this game fun--even if I start out not wanting to play this game, by the time the cat catches up with and eats its first mouse, it's tough not to be smiling and laughing at the poor hapless victims trying to get away, hindered by the merciless die!

Even more fun if you're drinking. (Of course, what kid's game isn't?)

Roll and move kids game, that has the neat feature of deciding when to get out of the game to cut your losses.   So there is a good push-your-luck element in here for kids as you race your mice around the track running away from the cat who is getting faster (and hungrier, I presume!)

Nagyon jó kis "race game" (versenyzős játék), macska-egér menekülős tematikával, ahol komoly "push your luck" ("kockáztatás") játékelem is megtalálható. Nem mindegy, hogy bemenekülök az egérkével az első biztonságot nyújtó kuckóba, ezzel némi kis sajtdarabhoz jutva, vagy megpróbálok eljutni sajtországba óriás guriga sajtot szerezni, kockáztatva a macska eledellé válást :). Na, ez az a pontja a játéknak, amiért nem nagyon játszik vele a Kislányom. Egész egyszerűen "retteg" attól, hogy akár egy egérkét is elveszítsen, így számára túlságosan nagy a feszültség a játékban (még nem érte el az 5 éves életkort). Az nem baj, ha az apa egérkéi már a játék felénél mind egy szálig elhullanak :). (2018.01.01)

Phenomenal production on the boards and bits - very, very high quality. My son had no problems playing and explaining the rules the adults. Great theme, decent level of decision making, and some tension as the cat gets closer to the mice. Recommended.

Very cute, the 2-lap cat track is clever, as is the fact that eliminated characters still get to roll for the cat on their turns. It plays a touch longer than I expected, though that's very dependent on the kids, as is their ability to keep from fiddling with the cheese bits on the corners of the board. Still, a great, great kids game. (I let go of it for my son's school game club, though, because it really wants the full complement of players.)

Yet another take on Midnight Party/Viva Pamplona. And, yes, I own all three of them. And, no, I wouldn't trade any of them away. Viva Topo stays in the collection for the amazing bits (mice, cat & cheese) and the nicely tuned "attack of the cat". Midnight Party hangs around because it works great with 6-8 people, and Viva Pamplona is the gamer-y version of the same thing.

I'm torn rating this, so I'm not going to leave a rating. I wish I could give a 'playing with the kids' rating and 'adult rating'. With my little kids this would be great (preschool or very early school). The production quality is top notch, it's simple enough for very young gamers, and is more than a mindless roll and move. We didn't have the kids with us at GenCon, so we played with adults, and it was kinda boring...

Rated from my daughter's perspective.  She loves the pieces (who wouldn't?), but the game is a little over her head.  The box says for ages 4 and up, but many of the decisions seem a little complicated.  Hopefully she'll be ready by the time she's 4.  This must purposely bear some resemblance to Viva Pamplona, though unlike the Kramer game there isn't really any incentive to be close to the cat.  I can see how kids would get upset when their mice get eaten.  I look forward to playing this more as my kids grow.

My rating assumes playing with children.  This is a cute game with great components, and even though its roll to move, you choose which of your mice you want to try to advance, and when to decide they're not going to make it to the best cheese and take a smaller piece before the cat gets them.

My 1 play so far with 4 people ended up taking just a bit too long for my 4 year olds liking, but before that he loved it.  A little older and having a little more attention span and he'd love it.  I can't wait to try it again with him.

The press-your-luck element to this game is the real hook.  It's quite deceptive.  Things appear to be going so well.  Your greed can easily get the best of you and before you know it, that cat is breathing down your neck and you've hardly gathered any cheese.  I like that tension in this game.

4歳半～6歳の息子と対戦。意外とうけない。4歳のときはチーズが取れないと怒りだして困った。最初のボードゲームとしてはレースゲームは選ばない方がいいかもしれない。ルールを変えてレースではなく、協力ゲームにしたら良かったかも。
コンポ―ネントは素晴らしいが、大人はお化けの「ヒューゴ（ミッドナイトパーティー）」の方が面白いかもしれない。５－６歳児となら７．５点。

Nagyon jó hangulatú gyerekjáték ez, imádom játszani a lányommal. Érdekes döntések vannak benne, nehéz eldönteni mivel jár jobban az ember, ha az elöl lévő hadd szökjön, vagy ha együtt próbáljuk mozgatni őket, de akkor meg ha begyorsul a macska, mind meghalunk...:D Szuper kis játék!

En mi opinión, un auténtico must have en una ludoteca infantil: componentes muy chulos (preciosos el gato y los ratoncitos) y una mezcla adecuada de suerte y decisiones más o menos arriesgadas, y planificación y cálculo de tus opciones de victoria (avanzar más te puede hacer conseguir más porciones de queso, pero si no te guareces a tiempo, el gato se te zampa). Funciona hasta con adultos.

This is a kid's game, but I found it to be rather entertaining even if I didn't have many decisions to make.

Great for a wooden toy set, but fails as a roll-and-move. Promising mechanics, push-your-luck risk management, cute components and such, but it's full of flaws.

This game is fun and engaging for kids of the right age.

The push-your-luck element of racing to stay in front of the cat is a blast, and the decision on how to spread your movement among mice is interesting.

The wooden pieces in the game are also really neat, and add another level of thematic enjoyment to the game.

This game is a big win for our family.

RATING: 8.6
Viva Topo! is a fun little kid’s game where each player tries to race their mice around the game track to pick up cheese. The further they get along the track the larger hunk of cheese they claim and consequently the more points they score. The catch is there is a cat who also advances along the game track and catches (and removes from play) all mice that (s)he catches. This means that players have to decide how best to manage their mice with the spectre of the cat an ever-present threat – especially as the cat goes much more quickly on its second lap of the game track.

I found Viva Topo! to be a thoroughly enjoyable kids game where every turn players have to make difficult decisions on where the concentrate their efforts, where to accept ‘small wins’ and which mice must be forsaken. We played twice with two adults and a seven year old and a five year old and each game went over a treat.

Overall – Viva Topo! is a great little game and one that I’ll look out for next time I am in the Games Library.

Beautiful looking components from Rio Grande. Fun enough game with a 'push your luck' aspect. Players must assess their level of risk in going for larger chunks of cheese at the potential cost of being caught by the cat.

Players can play it safe but those small cheese gains may not be enough to win in the end.

Early game can have some real pacing issues and this could be a problem with kids with short attention spans. The middle to end game is fun though as the threat of the cat becomes very real. 

Perfect for children aged 4-8, but I suspect it won't hold up for kids aged 8+ after more than a few plays.

A fun game of a cat chasing mice looking for cheese and ultimately cheese paradise.  Beautiful fun pieces and a great board.  This is not a simply roll and move game.

It’s a family game that has players balancing risk and rewards as they attempt to outrun the cat and score for cheese. Players attempt to advance their mice (pieces) from the start to any of various goals - the further the goal, the more cheese (points) it is worth. But will the chasing cat catch your mice before they get the big cheese? It's a neat kid's game. Mitternachtsparty satisfies the same itch - the die decides whether you get to progress the baddie or run away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very nice game that's awesome to play with the younger ones. Roll the dice get a number and move your mice along the track accordingly, decide which mouse to move and when to opt off the track to collect some cheese. The longer you stay on the track the bigger the reward but the greater the danger because every time the cat is rolled he moves along the track faster and faster eventually catching up the mice to eat them. Nice push your luck game with really awesome components. This one is great for the little kids but the big ones can get a kick out of it too.

In my opinion, the mouse pieces are too big for the board spaces, and the game feels very cramped, especially at the beginning.  The pieces themselves are quite cute - I just wish they were smaller and less round.  Also, my daughter (5) finds the premise a little distressing...

When I'm asked what type of games I play, I should really use this Ludo variant as an example of how much game design differs from the questioners expectations.

Firstly, there is the gorgeous production hooking the child with the toy like pieces, easily identifiable without the need for TV advertising to entice interest or want.

Whereas most licenced/mainstream products lack interesting gameplay for a mixed child/parent audience, here the Ludo variant shines through:

This isn't simply a race to get your mice home first. Instead it is the player with the most cheese pieces at game end that wins. The innovations here are that the game will eventually end as mice are eaten and not returned to start so no overstaying its welcome vibe; also the cat will also countdown the game end by only doing 2 circuits. What I like is that it is the game that inflicts the penalty of being eaten, not an opponent, so any negativity is directed at the die and not who rolled it. Lastly as the winner is determined by various size pieces (teaching differing degrees of a sixth), the focus of the race is switched easily to the journey as determining the leader involves a mental stretch of adding and comparing. I use to not like this design aspect, but I appreciate it more when I was aware of the cognitive shift and how it tempers the emotional want to win.

This children's game is really a winner.  It is a roll and move game, and how you roll has a big impact on the winner.  But there is always a choice about how conservative you are going to play, picking up small points, against the aggressive play for the big cheese.  Letting some mice getting eaten is a viable choice as well.  This means you do not have to help a four or five year old at all.  Their choices might be better than yours, depending upon future rolls.  That makes for a very satisfying game experience, watching a young one figure out what to do, and possibly beat you based upon their own choices that were different than yours. 

The quality of the mice and cat is very high.  It brings out the theme and lets the kids imagination engage with the game.  I highly recommend this game with kids from 3 to 6.

5-year-old likes this better than our other games (cult of the new), but it's a little much on the decision-making side for our 3.5-year-old (because he wants to just get the mice in a corner and grab little bits of cheese so he can play with that mouse and its cheese during downtime.  Not nearly as scripted as Max, but it's not cooperative so that's a downside at this age.  Nonetheless, it's pleasant and cute and keeps their attention and doesn't last too long.

RATING: N/A
A pretty enjoyable dice-driven race game for kids that actually offers some interesting choices throughout. Namely, how committed to you to all of your racers? Can you strategically drop out in order to gain [i]something[/i] for your efforts, or do you want to push your luck and keep going, hoping to collect more cheese? And...OK, that may be it. But still, two choices in a dice-driven racing game is two more than a lot of others, and that's enough to make this one a lot of fun. Good introduction to risk/reward, and good opportunity to talk about probability and change, since the cat accelerates as he makes his/her way around the board. 

Recommended for children, starting around age 4.

Decent little kid's game - very similar to Ghost Party.  I like the ability to jump out early for less victory points.  The cat movement is neat as well.  The more I play it, I really see that there are several ways to approach the game and you need to be flexible depending on what the cat has done in the early game.  When it speeds up, it really is lights out for everyone still moving mice.  The bits are great, the game is solid and is a little more engaging than Ghost Party for the younger children.  Solid kid's game.

Great press-your-luck game for kids. A roll and move game, but still plenty of choices to make. Do you bring out another mouse or advance one already in play? Do you focus on one mouse and leave the others behind, or try to move them all evenly? When should you duck in for cheese? The Cat gets faster as the game progresses, so if you wait too long you'll be out of luck.

Pleasant enough roll-move game for young children, I would say ages 3-6. Some very modest risk-management decisions make this a game rather than an activity.

Bought it because of its beautiful components and easy rules. Kids never got really excited with this one though. I did not expect me to like a roll-and-move game but did have higher expectations for the kids. And the mice are to good to let kids just play with them (and eventually lose or destroy them). All in all this one I would not recommend easily.

When judging kids games the rating still refects how much I want to play this game when I'm playing with my kids. This one lacks any big choices over many other kids games - you roll the dice, hope to get good numbers and race the other players for the best cheese. Okay... apart from the simplicity it moves along at a good pace and has nice bits (as always with Selecta games). My four year old said she found it a bit boring - not a favourite choice for her. I think it's a bit better than that.

The bits are fun and the gameplay is engaging for children.  My daughter (5 when we played) enjoyed herself and easily grasped the ideas of balancing ducking into the houses for smaller cheese to be safe and the risk of trying to get to a bigger cheese house.  More fun than some adult games that I've played.

Great game for 4yos - and way up! Now 6, my kid just loves it more and more. He tries out different strategies now.

Manfred Ludwig is one of my favorite kids' games designers, he really seems to "get" kids. Check out his Up the River/Marrakesh/Race through Space and other games, too.

It amazes me that this is both a game that at least my kid tends to win, although his strategies seem weird to me - or probably rather: because this game favors players who choose to play it the way 4yos tend to play it and NOT how adults are more likely to play it, which of course makes kids love the game. And it teaches about fractions, with its big round cheeses split into 6 parts. Wow.

All hail Manfred Ludwig!

I had rated this a 9 with 1 point withdrawn for the mice in my edition, which are too rounded underneath and keep rolling around on the board, but I see this has been corrected in the new edition, making the game a bright, shiny 10! :-) I have bought Viva Topo to gift to 4yos+

The ultimate roll your dice and move your mice game.  It is a good kids game, that just isn't all that amazing with adults.  There is enough here to play once, but frankly it doesn't hold up to the similar Hugo/Midnight Party.  Rolling a 5 is just too good and rolling a one just sucks.  No way around it.

It was a real disappointment when compared to Selecta far superior Giro Galoppo, which is a joy for adults.

This is a good game for small children. It is almost entirely luck, but do offer children some real choices as far as which mouse they want to move, and wheather they want to try and grab small pieces of cheese early or try and move around the board and grab larger pieces before the cat catches them.

It's pretty much Midnight Party, Jr., but it's fun to play with my daughter. She gets to move her mice (mousies) and the cat and thinks it's as much fun to get the mice as the cheese!

The kids LOVE this game (ages 5, 6, 8)! They want to play it over and over again.  In fact, whenever we play board games, this is the first one they want to play. 

It is so much fun and simple to learn. Plus the wooden mice and cat are amazing, compared to typical plastic game pieces.

***KID GAME RATING**** - 7

This is a great little push your luck game with fantastic bits. We like to add some flair to the game by naming our mouse "teams" or mice. The bits are great, though our board broke pretty easy and the mice tend to roll all over the place. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Cute mice!

It's like Midnight Party but with a mouse theme and cuter bits. Plays faster, too -- all good!

--- Summary ---
Players have mice that start in the center of the board. On your turn, roll the die and advance one of your mice as many spaces on the board. Each corner has 2 exits where mice can scurry to exit the track and score VP (more VP further from start). If you roll a 1, move the cat. The clever bit about the cat: it moves on it's on track, which is 1 lap around the track at the same pace as mice (1 pip = 1 space), then advancing twice as fast (1 pip = 2 spaces). If the cat lands/passes your mice, they are removed from the game. Continue till all mice safe/eaten. The player with the most cheese wins!

This is a fairly solid childrens push your luck game.  It plays relatively quickly, and is enjoyable.  But my daughter prefers Midnight Party in this genre--more for the theme than anything.  And since she much prefers Nacht Der Magier and Forbidden Island, this one doesn't come out anymore.

Perfectly serviceable little game with each player managing a family of mice trying to run away from a slow but relentless pussycat. I was amazed at how utterly positive and excited a reaction this got from a nine-year-old boy. Strategic requirements are light, but the dramatic potential of that menacing cat is apparently wonderful.

RATING: 6
[Selecta 2002 edition] {Animal, kid; roll-and-move; optimal 4p} {Adult 6; Kid 9} VT is an excellent children game: easy rule, fast play, thematic, attractive components and fun. The mechanic is quite similar to Hugo, where players have to decide how much risk to take.  Game play is fast with some meaningful decision. It has good replayability, too.  The dice range is too large for my taste; I would prefer the number to be 1C/1C/1/2/3/4; it could make the game more tense. The optional rule requiring players to act is silly, but it's fun!

Its components are stunning. The mice are cute but they are easy to roll over. I wish the cat were prettier.

Simple children's game that has a bit of a "press your luck" kind of feeling. Its probably a great introduction for this kind of game, but my 4 year old was a bit too young to get what was going on yet.

I eventually got rid of this. Despite being cool bits and all, it really was about the same as Ghost Party.

A hungry cat is chasing your mice -- do you run home fast or duck off to get some cheese? That's the basic premise of this kid's game. The gamer in me wished the cat was a bit faster, but my 4-year old daughter loves this game even if she can't quite figure out the press-your-luck aspect of the various sizes of cheese. To her, ANY cheese is a win and a job well done, and I suppose that's just fine. Give it a go with your young kids.

Rated as a kid's game. This is one of the best to play with my kids because they love the theme, and my 5-year-old can play on his own, making his own decisions (with just a little strategic prompting from parents). The kids like when the mice get eaten by the cat.

Good children's game. Plays best with 3 or 4 (a more aggressive cat), but certainly fun with 2.

The rating assumes playing with my daughter and one other person. 2 player, it's more like 7 or 7.5, and with adults only, it's more like a 4 or 5.

Viva Topo is a wonderful children's game. It is cute, with great components, and something even young kids can play by with their friends without any adult supervision. Of course, that said, this is very enjoyable as family game too.

It's a great introduction to the genre of push-your-luck games. Young children tend to love the cat chasing them around the track, and even better if they can catch a straggling mouse belonging to another player.

I highly recommend Viva Topo to any families with young children.

RATING: 10
Racing mice for wooden hunks of cheese while they are chased by a kitty meeple!  The components here are just fantastic.  There is a decent amount of decision making (for a kid's game) to balance the luck of the dice.  I found the press your luck of keeping a mouse on the board hoping for a bigger hunk of cheese vs jumping into a safe hole for a small hunk to be entertaining even from an adult perspective as well!

Rating note: As an adult game I don't think I'd give this more than a 5.5.  The press your luck is cute... but the overall game is too light and forgiving for grown ups.  I do think this game is just perfect for pre-school aged children and will be a great family game until the kids grow into something more challenging.

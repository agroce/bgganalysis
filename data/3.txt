[i]tl;dr - Samurai asks tough questions of you as you help yourself, but also help your neighbor. Who will win greater influence over medieval Japan? It all depends on the players. . .[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Let's talk about Samurai for a minute. Brilliant abstract? Check. Tense decisions that affect everyone else around the table? Check. A simple ruleset with a lot of depth? Check. Beautiful plasticy/clacky playing pieces? Checkity check check (oh I love to hear them rattle around in my hand).

Samurai is a simple game where you are trying to surround three types of figures: high hats (military), rice paddies (farming), and buddhas (priesthood). These three aspects of Japanese society will generally represent your influence/power over Japan, but let's not kid anyone: this is an abstract. That's totally fine, though, because this has the well-seasoned draw of a game that's confident in its own success and knows, just knows, that it will suck you in. 

So how do you get these pieces? You get them by surrounding their spots on a hex map of Japan. When a piece is totally surrounded by player hexes, the relative power of those hexes is compared, and whoever has the highest power for that symbol takes the piece. In other words, we all have hexes that range from 2-4 power, for each symbol, and as we gradually fill up the board, we're gauging one another's power around the various cities. 

The game ends when every piece has been removed from the board. At that point, we lift our player screens and reveal how many pieces of each type we've collected. If one player has a majority in two types of pieces, they win the game immediately. Otherwise, the game goes to a tiebreaker. Players remove all pieces from the type they won, and then compare the number of remaining pieces: most pieces wins. This is a brilliant little piece of strategy since your strongest power will be removed in the case of a tiebreaker -- so you need to be sure to be strong in all three areas. 

Samurai is honestly simpler to play than explain (I made a real hash of it above, but the actual act of playing is very simple), but it has some deviously difficult strategy. For one thing, we all have a few pieces that bend the rules of the game -- and we all have the same few pieces, but the timing of when we play them is the challenge! Waiting until the other players have used their valuable 'swap' hex makes your remaining swap hex the most valuable move left in the game -- but on the other hand, you could really swap those two tiles, and ahhhh, I can't wait! I'll swap it now. 

In summary, Samurai is a fantastic game that will see you bumping up against your friends on a too-tight map of Japan. It plays in about 30 minutes with 2-3 players, and can also accommodate 4 thanks to some clever modular boards. Highly recommended, you owe it to yourself to check out this classic.

This game has only gotten better with time. Possibly the perfect game, by objective standards. It scales perfectly, it plays fast, its beautiful to look at, it has lots of interesting decisions... and the theme shines through. 

By that I mean that, while its not a simulation, it makes me feel like this guy when I'm playing it - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMWsOyOHaaA - that is, you must control, hold back, feint... and strike like lightning when the moment is ripe.

LIKE: Tense every turn, clever mechanisms. Fun to look for interesting combos.
DISLIKE: Not the right tension for everyone. Difficult to remember who is dominant in which statue. Map is the same each game. Abstract, theme is dry.

OVERALL: One of the classic, great games. I enjoyed this but I feel there may be less variation game-to-game due to the static map, as the best map placements are not going to vary. Nonetheless, eagerly willing to play again.

OK game. The theme deserves mechanics less abstarct.

2016-02-08
Samurai is a pure abstract and the theme is there to only give the players some vague connection between numbers and real life. Instead of assigning a "three" you assign three "samurai". Samurais represent power which is easy to understand, and this is the only thing along with the map of Japan that connect the game with reality. Of course, it is not always fair to criticise a board game for its lack of reality, since you have to bring things to an abstract level to make a board game in the first place. However, for some reason with Samurai I found the game and the theme were disconnected. 

But once I was able to get past that, the game showed its true worth. Every turn you are facing tough decisions, which is something I particularly enjoy. There is enough luck in the tile draw to keep things interesting through introducing some fluctuation in the balance of power. Most of the time your decisions are tactical aiming at short to intermediate term goals, but there is a long term strategy element to the game as well. Scoring is such that it makes all fights over territory meaningful.

Samurai may not be the most exciting game out there but it works, and most importantly is fun if you like tactical games and do not mind direct competition.

Samurai was reprinted this year. It is an abstract game by Reiner Knizia. I only like abstract games that look great and Samurai is beautiful. It is a very clever tile-laying game where each player places his tiles on a Japanese grid to gain majority by adjacency over three different types of statues. The scoring is tricky because if you tie for one type of statue you count all your other statues as tie-breaker. I wish the game box would have a smaller size.

RATING: N/A
Very interesting game, but I felt the luck of the draw influenced the outcomes more than in Tigris & Euphrates, and didn't like that.

If you only draw "the best" tiles right away, they feel wasted, and the missed opportunities feel more negative than the positive of winning a symbol.  The finite nature of the pieces felt lacking, compared to the "every piece counts for 1" in T&E.

Would play again, but as I own Tigris & Euphrates, I do not need to own this.

This is not as good as Tigris and Euphrates, obviously.  It's also, I think, a lesser game than Through the Desert.  That said, I like it a lot -- it's fast, interesting, tense, a lot of things I want in a game with this length.  2 player, it's a fine 20-30 minutes.

My wife (and a lot of other people) think it's "ok" -- perhaps dull, perhaps confusing, perhaps too arithmetic-ish.  They have a point.  My primary gripe is that the scoring is rather baroque and non-intuitive, while Tigris is perfection and Through the Desert makes sense in a component-balancing way.

Surround with greater numbers for a figure. The figures become a set-like collection that will get you points.

Simple, fast, little bit of thinking (1 counter to snag 2 tokens, etc).....and thats about it. Seriously, lots of options in the beginning....nothing much about strategy. Mid to late game has some thinking to it....thats normal....lesser tiles left for that few figures left on the board. SOmetimes, the actions are very obvious....much like Otello or Checkers.

Was told by a gamer that this is RK's greatest design. Felt sorry for him.

Good filler. Nothing more unfortunately for me about this game.

Samurai is my first Knizia game and I thoroughly enjoyed the game mechanics and design. It's a short, quick, simple game with a subtle strategy. Yet, the moves can be complex and thought-provoking with a chess-like quality. 

One of my favorite elements is the game end trigger - the game ends when the last figure of any type is removed from the board, or when the 4th figure is placed beside the board due to a tie. So, if you think you're in the lead, you can force the game to end. Now, there are 3 types of figures on the game board: high helmets, rice fields, and budhas. If you get the most figures of 2-3 types at the game end, you win. If there is a tie, the end scoring is complicated and the rule book doesn't properly explain (to new players anyway) how the winner is determined. Even now that I understand the tie conditions, it's not entirely intuitive.

My bf has several issues with the game. He strongly dislikes the end scoring, particularly since your strategy is fairly limited and predetermined by the 5 face up tiles hidden behind your player screen. He feels that because you don't have much choice over which particular figure to go for (that you can possibly win), the end scoring shouldn't be tied to getting the most figure types only (with no value associated to the number of figures). His suggestion is that there should be a point system - something like: score 3 pts for each figure that you have the most of (compared to your other pieces), score 2 pts for the second most, and 1 pt for the third. I personally don't have a problem with the end scoring in Samurai, but I do agree with the overall analysis. However, since most of our games are with 2 players, maybe the game dynamic will change with more players. 

UPDATE: This is another favorite game in my collection.

Mmmm...yummy.

The scalable board is very nice, and the black plexiglass figures are very cool.

The gameplay is wonderful as well.  A touch of randomness, as tile draw order does impact the game a bit, but I've never felt it hindered me or helped another player too much.  It's relatively easy to teach, and the theme/artwork is pretty attractive.  It would likely make decent "gateway game" material as well.

Summary: GREAT game.  Get it.

Did well at this one. Strategy games seem to be my strength. Having said that, I would agree with another reviewer that the game does seem a little 'dry'. The mechanics work well enough, but where's the 'meat'. I also found that the game was virtually over before I had gotten into my stride, and I felt that I'd missed something (although I still won). Still it was nice to play something that I understood easily, rather than the game I played just prior to it (and which someone compared this to  !!!) the much overpraised Euphrates & Tigris, which I have decided that I truly hate.

Great tile placement game. Easy to teach and play and fast to set-up. There is a lot of player interaction going on and despite the simple rules this game has a lot of depth. Many options for the players. Very small amount of luck. I like that the board is modular depending on the number of players. The only minus is that the game is abstract and it doesnt really try to hide it.

Finally got around to playing this classic, and it did not disappoint.  This is a well designed spatial challenge with some excellent player prediction concerns.  I say this after playing the one time.  

The one thing that causes me some concern with Samurai is that perhaps games can be won or lost simply based upon whether you properly memorized which token each player took.  I would hate to see that becoming the core, decisive factor in such an otherwise well-designed game.  I wonder how the game would play if "tokens taken" were visible for all to see.  Hmmm... (8 of 10, August 2013)

On second play, not sure I would rate it quite so highly due to the essentially non-existent theme, going down to a 7, and as before, the memorization of tokens should likely be scuttled from the game design, such that as they are acquired they are simply placed in front of the screens.

I am really enjoying this game, it does go a bit long with the more AP prone players but I look forward to future plays. 

EDIT: Apparently I have been dropping the rule about how to determine the winner. Instead, having the majority pieces holder of a certain type is the winner. I would rate the game as it is intended to be played as a 7 and the way I play it as an 8.6.

Very abstract but works as an analytical game. Looks nice, too. I've only played with two players; I think this might suit me better with more so it wouldn't be possible to plan ahead quite as far.

Wow, what a solid game. It sat on my shelf for while, but I played this with my brother and it was really good. I don't like to play games with only 2 players (Samurai supports more of course), but the game play was smooth and fun all the way through. It is good to have many options to play and even if one person makes one good move, you always have a counter ready.

RATING: 7
The good is that the components look great, the rules are quick and simple, the game plays fast, and there are a few interesting decisions to be made.  Samurai is unique in that it feels like a heavy filler game.

The potential problems are that the random tile draw can sometimes really mess you up, and that, because the game is largely everyone waiting for someone else to create an opening to score, a poor play by one player can really set up the next player and screw everyone else at the table.

It's solid, but not a game I would quickly buy again.  I'm also wondering if it would work better if I considered it more as filler and stuck to playing it with just two players.

RATING: 9
Beautiful production.  I STRONGLY prefer open scoring on this one - I think it's extremely useful strategy-wise and doesn't add a ton of AP.  I played and liked the game, but never really played it even after borrowing a copy.  I started playing by web at mabiweb.com, and it really opened up for me.  A long-deserved 9.  I played a whopping 596 times before the online play rights were unfortunately rescinded.  Per site statistics the game has a strong first player advantage in 2P games, an effect somewhat improved by removing P1's 2-ship piece.  Extremely replayable! Strong left-right issues too, but multiplayer is still fun.

A very good game with 2, 3, or 4 players.  Game is abstract, but the theme makes the components and map pleasant.  One of the best Knizia titles available.  The game affords the strategist ample opportunity to think and rethink plans.  The scoring mechanism forces the players to balance scoring a majority in one symbol and capturing as many other symbols as possible.  No majority score eliminates the player from contention.  Too few other symbols losses the game.  [GTI Code: AGSD]

Keeping track of who has taken what from the board seems to be almost as important as working to insure you get the things you want. Some luck regarding which of your tiles you draw after each turn but that shouldn't have a lot of impact.

RATING: 7
A light tile laying game that requires some thinking to do well. Short enough to play two or more times in one go. Since the board gets smaller with fewer players it scales well. You can really be quite nasty with other players. All players have the same setup of tiles but you play with a hand of 5 so there is a controlled amount of luck involved that lightens up the game. Because of the hidden score and the way tokens are counted the game is quite interesting all the way to the end.

RATING: 7
Samurai is a tactical/abstract game where players are placing titles to win faction tokens (only 3 types). If a player manages to have majority in 2 or 3 factions at the end of the game, they win. Thing is... that's unlikely to happen. If there is a tie for majority, each player with a majority counts the other faction token they control and whoever has the most wins. Thus players want to have majorities but they don't necessarily want more tokens than they need of that particular majority. And finding that balance of faction tokens is partially what makes this game so rich. 

The other part is the limited distribution of tiles, which players place to win those faction tokens. Each player has the same tiles and will never place tokens back into the draw bag. Thus, as tiles are placed, players have concrete information to make very informed decisions about what can be placed. Thus, a player may ignore taking a faction token (which happens when it is surrounded on land) knowing they can't lose it. But the player must also be mindful of end-game conditions, as another player may attempt to end the game so that faction token remains unresolved. 

In some ways, this game can be seen as a lighter version of Tigris and Euphrates. But through its simple rule set, it manages to have multiple layers of depth and feels quite chess-like in its calculating/abstract nature. Overall, it is a brilliantly designed game and I can see my rating increase with more plays.

RATING: 10
A wonderful tile placement game from Renier Knizia. The components are top notch, from the puzzle piece boards to the hex tiles and the plastic figurines. The only downsides are that the boards are a bit on the thin side and the '1', stylized to look like Sinic character writing like many things set in East Asia, looks like a '7', which can be confusing to new players.

The game play is very simple and surprisingly fast. Lay all the figurines on to the cities, with no two same types of figures on the same city, one at a time in turn order. Afterwards, just place a tile, take another turn if it has a kanji on it, then refresh to five tiles. If a city is completely surrounded by land tiles, the players with the most powerful tiles (indicated by the number on the tile) wins the figurine. As I said, it's very easy to explain and quick to play, although that is adjustable depending on how AP-tolerant players are (that a plus and minus, if the players agree on not). 

The biggest problem is with end game victory conditions. It's not that hard, but it's still on the wonky side. It's bit like Lost Cities in that way. It's best when explaining the game, to put this first and foremost. Definitely worth getting.

Packs a powerful punch in 1/2 an hour. The thing I appreciate the most in Knizia's games is how well they scale up from 2 to 4 or 5 players - and Samurai is no exception.  Similar to Through the Desert in terms of simple game play yet difficult decisions. As for the bizarre scoring system, I think it's a feature rather than a flaw as some detractors will have you believe.

Stratégiai játékra számítottam, de ez egy szép japán köntösbe burkolt logikai játék. A legtöbb logikaival szemben ezt többen is lehet játszani, mi ketten és hárman is próbáltuk, mindkét létszámmal élvezetes volt. Különféle taktikákat próbáltunk, egyikünk pl. 5 lapkát kipakolt mindjárt kezdéskor, de én inkább arra szavazok, hogy megéri kivárni. Szívesen játszanék máskor is, nem tartom annyira durván agyroppantónak, mint ahogy nekem beharangozták. A Shogun előtt játszva bemelegítő-partinak tűnt.

I finished a game of this with two new players before one of the other tables had even finished their rules teach at my club.  Very replayable and lots of emerging strategy.  Occasionally it does seem to come down a little too often to 3rd tie breakers etc. but this remains to be an excellent game at all counts and one that particularly shines with 3.

Gorgeous, minimalist, tile laying and figure capturing 4 player time filler. Quick to play easy to teach. May be abstract, but thats part of its charm. Japanese simplicity at its finest with elegance and sophistication.

I have played the Klear Computer version many times and now i have the real thing. Elegant and deep this game is excellent and even better face to face. Modular board means the game scales well for 2-4 players. I have played 30+ games of this on the pc version and feel like i am just scratching the surface. Also, anything with little buddhas in it has to be good !

*bumped to a 10 - one of my favourites with any number and plays fast with two which is a bonus

RATING: 8
An older release, but thanks to the reprint, one that was easy for me to finally buy and play. It absolutely deserved a new edition, this small but well-formed game of area control has just enough tricks up its sleeve to be quite replayable for some time. I do hate that FFG uses its huge box size regardless to what is needed, but I can live with it for now.

Nice variable Knizia where the setting up is a game itself. You have to handle the luck. It would be easy to do some leaderbashing, if you only knew who where in the lead. Can be a bit stale towards the endgame, when noone wants to create opporutinties for other players.

I really, really like this game - the craftsmanship, the length of play, the ability to scale. It works as a great medium filler, and is easy to teach. Just finished a 4-player where the 4th place finisher ended the game with a three-piece (two hi-hats and a buddha) acquisition play (at least made her competitive, but still didn't have any majority)!

RATING: 8
Samurai first and foremost is one of the best looking games I own. Beautiful jet black pieces, a wonderful modular board (depending on player #), and nice chunky tiles to lay on the board. Secondly, in typical Knizia fashion, it has an innovative scoring mechanism. I think it works best with 3, although I have yet to play it with 2. I will update after playing 2 player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Amazingly quick yet fun in a way that I'm not sure how.  It's a nim game of sorts, and perhaps works on the same principles as 6 Nimmt! and Coloretto, though it uses a board and hexagonal placement and one of Knizia's signature scoring methods.
  
I keep this game around because it's simple, quick, elegant, and a beautiful demonstration of Knizia's scoring method.  It also plays well with the number of players that it advertises (as Knizia games typically do).

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2011/11/samurai.html]Samurai[/url] es uno de mis juegos favoritos de Knizia junto al Tigris y Eúfrates, que salvando distancias, puede llagar a transmitir parecidas sensaciones. He jugado más de 100 partidas y no me ha cansado, el juego resiste muy bien. El ser tan abstracto hace que no guste a todo el mundo, y he aquí su mayor problema, es difícil encontrar jugadores y más difícil todavía, buenos jugadores. Yo he adquirido mi nivel gracias a mabiweb. Agradezco la oportunidad de haber encontrado contrincantes de buen nivel y de esta manera he mejorado notablemente mi juego, y sobre todo el haberme dado cuenta lo grande que es este juego.

Another very interesting, yet slightly unaproachable, tile laying game from Knizia. Beautiful looking pieces and game play that forces many difficult decisions. It's fast and very enjoyable. I expect my rating for this game to rise with more plays.

As much as I love this game it frustrates me. 4 plays and 4 games in which I haven't even had a chance of winning.

Finally, a win (and a good one) in my 5th game. I think it's starting to click.

Might be improved with scoring bits in front of the screen, with them behind I'm not likely to ever play this again.

Rather unsurprisingly, I'm not a fan of the random tile draws.  Pushing through nearly all of the "free" action tiles early seems like a great way to win the game.

Otherwise, a very straightforward area majority game without any real interesting bits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game has limited luck involved. You initially choose your opening hand of tiles, and replace every tile you use randomly from your set of tiles. However, having random tiles isn't always that random, because for every tile there are only so many locations you intend to place it. Some of the game is having the right tile handy at the right opportune moment, but a good player can always make the most of what he has, while holding that perfect tile (or combo of tiles) until the moment is right to strike. For those with good memories, you can usually work out what tiles the opponents have remaining as well. So it can boil down to maximising your effect versus theirs, which makes it more the game of skill. For just a little bit of chaos, there are two tiles which let you switch something on the board - either re-use one of your great tiles, or swap two of the trophy pieces across the board. And some pieces can be played two or more per turn, which keeps you on your toes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A Knizia abstract title with a quaint Japanese theme that employs area control and set collecting mechanics. 

I've introduced this to non gamers with positive results; the simple rules coupled with the pleasing production values being the primary factor in their enjoyment. The endgame scoring could be taken as a little obtuse.

This is not to say that the game is overly simplistic. There is a lot going on and the more experienced player will inevitably win.

This is a solid, elegant game that scales well with just the right mix of luck that is great for gamers and non gamers alike.

Quick, fun, as deep as you want it to be. I'm a sucker for Japanese themes (I lived in Tokyo for a while). Theme aside though, a great game that is easy to teach and learn and yet has great replay value. This game is phenomenal with 2 players, and yet still fun and engaging with more.

I've played once with 2 players and once with 3 players.  I liked it better with 3 and, overall, this is a quality abstract game.

I've rated it an 8 but think I need to play it a few more times to feel more comfortable with my rating.

Oh my God!  My favorite 3 player game.  This game is so fun because the strategies are deep and even when you think you might have won there are ways for your opponents to take victories away from you that you did not anticipate.  Excellent 2-player, Even better 3-player game.  I played with 4 players and my advice is to not under estimate the tiles that permit you to play another tile

After years of putting it off I finally took the plunge and bought Samurai. I'm so glad I did and it has been a surprise hit with my gaming buddies. We're not typically abstract euro gamers but everybody loved it and praises it highly. Importantly for me, the FFG edition board looks so much nicer than any of the photos I've seen of it - previously I'd thought the old Rio Grande edition board looked far superior to the new one but now I'm completely satisfied and can recommend this without hesitation.   And yes, it does scale excellently between 2 and 4 players. The 2 player game feels different - lighter perhaps - and certainly quicker. 4 is okay but there's a lot more to look at and the beer didn't help! 3 players  is great and is probably the sweet spot.

Quick and tense.  I enjoy the two player version.  You have think and double think and then double think that to be able to get your opponent to play where you want them to play.

Update (May 09).  Raised to an 8.5 (from a 7).  Now that I have played numerous times online I have gotten more into alot of the strategy that goes on which helps you make approrpriate tactical moves.  For what can be a deep game it plays in 30 minutes in person.  Love it love it love it.  Great with 2, 3 and 4 people.

Update Aug 2011 - it's a 10 but only with people who have played it before.  Otherwise it remains an 8.5.  With people who played it, it is an intense game where little moves end up being huge and with the experienced players, noone throws the game inadvertently.

RATING: 9
Very Sun Tzu! Choose your battles and bluff to devastate the enemy with as small means as possible. All armies are one-offs and everyone starts with the same complement of armies, meaning you are guaranteed to lose a lot of battles.

One criticism is that the game is overly equilibristic: you will find that players score similarly almost regardless of skill.

I have a love/hate relationship with area control. I like the mechanic in theory, but almost every game frustrates me as it is so zero sum! (But, ironically, it's still a huge factor in me choosing to play a game - bring on area control!).  This one though, is just OK. I played it with 3 and it's a little too chess-like. I like a little more unpredictable randomness in my games!

I get the feeling that if someone spent enough time analyzing the mechanics of this game they could create an equation that would allow them to make the OPTIMAL move every time.  For some people that may seem like a turn-off in a "game".  But, because it would be a really complicated simulation it should be out of reach for all of us as players to decode... but the best players may just start to get the feel for the fringes of the equation and this is exciting to me.  The "special" action tiles and the twisty VP calculation of this game make it stand out...  Plus its got shiny black buddhas in it!

This game offers the right combinations of balance and playability with 2-4 players, and plays at about an hour or less. The scoring forces one to be vigilant of who is getting the majority in the three different groups which must be acquired. Well-timed placements of the few tiles (21) available can turn the tide, so patience is crucial. Should have more plays than it gets. 
UPDATE: Moved up a notch because it is remaining popular in my gaming group.  It has not only kept my interest but increased it with more plays.

As far as tile placement games go, Samurai blows Carcassonne out of the water. A little on the brain-burning side, each decision must be weighed up, since sloppy plays will likely result in easy scoring opportunities for the player to your left. Beautiful components, although the player screens are a bit flimsy. The strategy of this game eludes me, so my rating might be biased.

A highly tactical game. Elegantly designed to be a super tight game. Razor thin margins of victory that are meaningful and tense.

A nice subtle co-relation with its theme of influencing different classes of ancient Japanese society.

Holds up to replay quite nicely. A great standby. Not necessarily the first game one reaches for, but it doesn't fail to deliver.

RATING: 6
Very simple, very clever, but with an annoyingly complex scoring system. One thing I do NOT like about this game (this is a general pet peeve of mine) is that it has a setup round (placing the figures on the board) that presupposes a deeper knowledge of the game. Even after playing the game once, I don't think my wife or I knew enough to have ANY sense whatsoever about how best to place the initial figures. And I have a sense that that initial placement has a big effect on the eventual outcome.

That being said, the game itself has this sort of classical Knizia tension where you build something up slowly, increasing the tension until suddenly it breaks, barely in favor of one player or another. And there's the trademark feature of wanting to place tiles in a half-dozen places -- without the resources to do so!

UPDATE: 7 -> 6. This game is too abstract and brain-burning.

Beautiful game to play.  Simple rules but many many layers of strategic and tactical complexity.  My first try, despite the fact that I was the one who had read the rules and explained it, yielded an incredibly poor performance as any strategy at all eluded me.  Second play yielded much better results as gameplay started to sink in and the beauty of the game became apparent.  Now I can't wait to get it back out so that I can win my first game.[EDIT]I've got my first win and still the game gets better.  Upped from an 8 to a 9 because there are few games that I want to play as much as this.

RATING: 4
Samurai was just really dry and boring to me with no "fun factor". The laying of tiles doesn't really make me feel like I'm doing anything. At least when I lay a tile in Carcassonne I feel like I'm building something, or when I lay a tile in Entdecker I feel like I've explored something. In Samurai, I just feel like I layed a tile with a number on it. On the plus side, Samurai is short. If you're bored with it, at least it's over quickly!

RATING: 8
Updated 8/20/10.
5+ plays.  All 2 players. 

I've now played Samurai quite a bit, and the game has grown on my somewhat from my initial few plays.  The last two plays were especially tense and competitive.  I've moved it up to the [u]very[/u] bottom end of my sevens.  

One of the problems with approaching the game as a new player is that it lacks the required interstitial game states to provide in-game feedback.  When I play a tile to the board, nothing tells me whether I've done well or poorly.  Even my play results in capturing the token I'd been eyeing, I am not immediately conscious of the opportunity costs of my play (which play a large role in successful strategy).  Consequently, the game has a quite high entry barrier, which, I think, really undermines some of the fun to be had.  Better players will almost inevitably win, and poor players will rarely understand why they lost without many repeated plays.  For a game that runs 30 minutes, and in which most of your time is spent deep in thought, the underwhelming sense produced by the endgame is disappointing.

But between two evenly matched opponents, Samurai is a fun challenge that adds a different (spatial) dimension to Knizia's number-crunching offerings (Battle Line, Lost Cities, and Keltis).  The components are attractive and top-notch.  I'm not sure that the endless replayability is really there, but if you only take it out for two games a month, it will probably keep you entertained for quite some time.

RATING: 7
Very Knizia-esque. That was my first reaction after having played this game.

Samurai lacks the conflicts seen in E&T, which offer so much excitement and dynamism to board development - the ebb and flow of empires. For a game set in war-torn Feudal Japan, it's for my tastes too tame and peaceful. In terms of mechanics, I consider E&T's theme more credible.

Similarly, I find Samurai more calculational in nature compared to E&T since you're constantly sumning up the various numbers printed on tiles. Not quite what one would expect from what many here describe as the lighter counterpart to E&T.

Okay, Samurai might not compare favourably with Knizia's Opus Magnum, but what about the other tile-laying games of his?

Samurai and Through the Desert roughly equal each other in terms of playing time. However, I should argue that the latter is more accessible and enjoyable to "non-gamers". Less calculational and more intuitive scoring (that said, I do like Samurai's manner of scoring).

Both Trough the Desert and Samurai score points for scaling better than E&T, it has to be said.

Einfach Genial is a more recent entry into Knizia's tile-laying series and may be the lightest of them yet, though the fun factor of camel-laying Through the Desert appears to me greater.

Here my list of preference:
1) E&T
2) Through the Desert
3) Samurai
4) Einfach Genial

All perfectly enjoyable and as tastes differ, so will other people rank these in an other manner.

Oh yes, Klear Games has done a very nicely done PC conversion. Well worth checking out!

RATING: 8
Context free, I would rate this game higher. It's a very fun game. I like figuring out how to place my tiles. Having little short term plans with the little knowledge I have.

However, that last sentence is the problem. I really enjoy the random draw in Tigris & Euphrates. It creates the element of uncertainty that adds risk to engaging conflict. However, it does not prevent long term planning. In Samurai I felt more that until the end game when my pool of tiles was tiny or empty, that long term planning was a bit of a fool's errand. Too many unknowns (both mine and my opponent's).

Which brings me to a swing in the other direction. Through the Desert is also about claiming spots on the board, but in this one there is no hidden information. It allows me to plan into the future, but more importantly, it allows me to make decisions knowing that I'm sacrificing one area for another. In Samurai, with all the hidden information, I never know if I'm sacrificing anything by not playing somewhere. I feel I am playing blindly.

Thus, Samurai is a game I enjoy playing, but would almost always choose either T&E or TtD over it.

A near zero-luck game that's pretty deep that plays in an hour. Nice. The production value is very high without being cheesy, a eurogame rarity. 

I don't usually have a strong opinion on hidden trackable information, but this is so much better and so much more tense with open holdings. 

Playing this again recently gave me such a feeling of delight that is absent from the grindhouse of contemporary Euros that I had to move it up from 8 to 9. It took me exactly 3 minutes to explain the rules to a new player, and played in 45 minutes with 4 players. It's all about manipulating your opponents into placing in the areas you want them to - a quality absent these days. Outstanding game.

Extremely clever gameplay - the good Doctor, Knizia, strikes again! I absolutely love this game. My girlfriend on the other hand... Not so much. However, luckily my father enjoys this game tremendously and is almost always willing to give it a whirl. My rating is for 2-3 players; with 4, it's more like a 6 as it's much more chaotic... 

It plays pretty quickly compared to the deep gameplay you get, so it's easy to squeeze this one in between other games - it's probably the BEST short game (short as in 30-45 minutes or so) I've ever played - although even I can get AP in this game, and I'm definitely not an "AP-kinda-guy".

The fact that you draw your tiles randomly has decreased my rating slightly as I have seen several times that it's VERY hard to win if you for instance start with the swap tiles (both the "figure swap" tile and the "swapping your old placed tile for this" tile) along with some samurais. And if you get your Japanese rider and the ships in the end, well, then it's going to be much harder to win. Also, there is a strong right-player binding as you can benefit a lot if the player to your right makes a suboptimal move, and the first player mathematically seems to have an advantage, but it hasn't been too big of a problem in my plays.

However, that being said, a skilled player will beat a new player almost every time (like in Puerto Rico and such). With equally skilled players, it's a great tactical game and it's definitely one of my favorite games. Once again Knizia has created a masterpiece!

Received via a math trade by trading away Neuroshima Hex. After reading the rules and playing a "dummy" game, I can tell that I significantly upgraded one nasty tile laying game for another. This has a lot of promise.

Update: rated 8 after two back-to-back plays. Yep, I like this better than Neuroshima Hex. There's greater tension, and though there's the luck of the tile draw, it's easier to mitigate some bad draws. There's always something to do with your five tiles.

Reiner Knizia's best games incorporate tense and tough choices. This is right up there with his best games.

Update: Two more plays with family. Quick observation--this is not a gateway game. Although the rules are streamlined, the tactics/strategy is pretty obtuse for a casual gamer. That doesn't mean it's a bad game; I think it's a very solid game. It's simply not easy on the casual gamer.

Update: I ultimately sold this. I really like the game, but I've not found other players that share my opinion. If this gets reprinted I can see myself picking it up again. But for now, I'll maintain my collection and ensure I'm keeping games that get played.

Still enjoy playing this abstract but I like other abstract games a bit more. It's thinky and does get better with more plays, but the scoring drives me up a wall and I'm never good at maximizing my strategy to the scoring as I always end up last when we play. Great 3 player game though!

This is a really interesting game, and also very nice-looking.  With clever placement, it's possible to get a whole lot of mileage out of the special tiles, so noone can ever be sure of a lead.  There are always alot of choices, but the rules are simple, and you don't feel like you have to over-analyze every move.  We have played with 2 or 3 players and it works great either way.

I'm a big fan. My wife not so much. I love the balance. Win the city, but not by too much. Win the suit, but not by too much. Fun, quick, and, as is very important for us, a great two-player game. (Actually, I haven't played with three yet, but I can imagine it is fun, although a very different dynamic.)

People don't seem to understand that Knizia's games will tend towards the abstract, with pasted on themes, but will still be very compelling to play. This area control game mixes a huge amount of strategy and a smaller amount of luck into a great game - my only problem is trying to describe what you need to win (the most pieces of your least prevalent type?) to new players.

RATING: 9
80plus plays (4p, 3p, 2p). More plays not logged here. Engaging, tense, easy rules, beautiful mechanism, tricky, anxious strategy--a lot of drama and nail-biting, opportunity for tricky plays too. It looks great, and its design clarity helps the play. In my experience, sometimes leads to nearly silent play, but not in all groups. Quite fun yet thinky game, highly recommended, really a must-own, in my opinion. The scoring makes for surprise game plots. There is a bit of luck, but on average seems like a controlled amount to keep it approachable (moreso with Select Starting Tiles, although I prefer Random) and freedom from determination while still rewarding brain calculation.  It may be that the endgame is sometimes Solvable (notwithstanding unpredictability of 3, 4 player games.)  Scales exceptionally well... however I think the 2 player game is best (2 player rating 9; 3-4 players I'd rate an 8).  Kingmaker endings are possible, but not a huge problem.  3 or 4 players may suffer sometimes from the "unfairness" feeling of some multi-player wargames and area control games (why pick on me, I'm not the leader, you are giving Player X to your left the victory, etc). However, play can be rapid and that is a cure for that problem. Most of my plays are 4-player.  And here is something special-- a friend called me up from across the country to thank me for introducing him to the game. I think Samurai a classic. It packs flat in a large plastic envelope. UPDATE: playing many games on the iTouch/iPad app with faraway pals.  After several years Samurai remains the eurogame that I play the most.

RATING: 8
I can;t quite put my finger on what I feels so elegant about the game, but it has struck a nerve with me.  It is a simple game of tile management and area control.  Usually these kinds of game only appeal to me if there is a layered component of area control (like Carolus Magnus or King of Siam), but this one plays so smooth.

There are some nice elements in the game that help you control tempo, which turns what could be a blandly tactical  into something that feels a little more strategic.  The coming of the end game can be controlled to an extent, and "fast" tiles can be used to deliver a 1-2 punch (or 1-2-3 punch) to swing some key scoring in your direction.  The system works pretty well to provide constraints in the limited number of tiles you hold, and the tie-breaker scenario creates a bit of tension in the 2-player game.

Absolutely tremendous.  I did not feel this was too abstract, and actually enjoyed the theme and gameplay.  I have played this online at Mabiweb over 270 times but I highly recommend this as a face to face game.

RATING: 7
A very good game.  Scales very well from 2-4 players.  Doesn't have the problem with three players that most games do, which is that two players square off and leave the third to win handily.  Though it's subtle, conflict actually benefits the winner more than an unopposed capture would.  Losing a conflict, however, is a terrible setback, so a wise player is careful to never overcommit.  The entire game is designed to reward using the minimum required force to acheve the desired effect.  

The extra gravy is that Samurai clocks in at under an hour.

RATING: 4
Yet another tile laying title from Knizia. More to think about than Durch but less control. Much less convoluted than Euphrat. An interesting medium between the two. The basic idea being to surround scoring pieces (3 different kinds) with the highest valued hexes possible denoting that piece, thusly gaining a majority and capturing the piece. The goal being to gain the most control in at least 1, preferably 2 of the sets. Because that can be difficult to do with 3 players, the game has a nice tie break mechanism as well which rewards the player who captured the most pieces outside of the suit that they won, thus rewarding diversity. The random tile draw is a bit ugly at times, but in a game this short some luck is acceptable to me. Overall decent, but I don't like it more than Durch despite the variance in tile value because the randomness of the draw makes it frustrating at times while one always is in complete control in Durch. Bland.

This is one of my favorite games. My wargame itch can be scratched somewhat when I play this as it has both a strategic and tactical feel. I love playing this game with any number of players (2-4), as it scales perfectly. The quick playing time and the beautiful pieces are an added bonus. I do enjoy the theme even if it could have been set in plenty of different settings.

There is an excellent online implementation of this over at www.mabiweb.com. I find I play it differently there than face to face. I take much more time to ponder my decisions before making a move. I guess that can be said about a lot of play by web games when you are not playing "real time" and there is no rush.

I'm a Knizia junky, and I have trouble giving any of his games a bad rating.  I am not trouble at all with the lack of real theme to this game.  It is a brilliant abstract game that can be played with gamers and nongamers alike, and with the ability to go from 2 to 4 players and have truly an enjoyable experience regardless, this game is a true classic.

An elegant design that is simple and clean.  The fact that all players start with the same tile sets means your chances for victory depent on how you use what you have.  You have to be smart and know when to lose a battle to try and win the war.  Scoring also influences how you allocate your limited resources of influence.  Just a good, good game!

Interesting tile-laying game where players are working toward majority control of cities and villages.  Kind of a weird scoring system.

It has turn angst, which is a very good thing, but I still find it a little dry.

RATING: 6
Samurai is one of the last 'olde skool' titles published by 999 Games which I hadn't played, so when the opportunity presented itself somewhere in 2005 or 2006, I was very eager to give it a go. I don't remember much from the experience, save that the scoring sounded complex and confusing.

Fast forward to 2009. With a gaming neighbour's copy we decided to play a few games with 3 players. The scoring sounded very clear and straightforward now, and I was able to focus much better on what needed doing. The game turned out to be a sort of area influence title, with as prize stylish black playing pieces, and the winner having the highest total of pieces collected next to an absolute majority of a single type. In other words, collect pieces of one type like crazy until you have the majority (which in a 3 player game is likely with 4, extremely likely with 5, and assured with 6), and then collect as many of the other two types as possible. Really not that complex.

As for the game... Well, it allowed for a bit of interesting tactical play, but overall I found it bland and a bit boring. You don't have much control over your own influence, and one more than one occasion a carefully constructed soon-to-be-majority around a playing piece was upset by a strong tile of another player, or a move-stuff-about one. This blind aspect makes it less interesting than it should be; I think I'd like it a lot more if the game were played open, so without hidden information. But then it becomes a direct competitor of Through the Desert, which in my opinion has more interesting game play: that game is about encirclement and not about multiple majorities around certain fields on the board. Samurai is by no means a bad game, but I do not consider it 'great' either. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Another overrated Knizia game.  The amount of screwage makes it impossible to plan ahead, but the game doesn't move quickly enough work at a purely tactical level.  Furthermore, a player who gets many fast tiles during the early game has no chance of winning, and the last player usually gets one less turn than everyone else.

Tiene unas reglas muy sencillas, numerosas formas de hacer el set-up del juego, vale perfectamente para 2-4 jugadores, una muy buena forma de puntuar nada complicada y a todo ello se le une una estupenda ambientación antigua japonesa, hace ello un gran juego en el que habrá que pensar muy bien cada jugada.

Another game not like anything else in my collection.  I'm no where near being good at this.  All I know is not to leave an easy picking for the next player.  This games scales better than any other I own.  If there is one newbie, need to explain about not leaving and easy grab for the next player, else the game may unbalance.

Very good tactical game. Plays well with three or four players. Two is fine. If you have some nasty opponents Samurai can be a real brain burner, but it plays well as a (medium) light etertainment also. Intriguing scoring system.

I do enjoy this game, but am not yet good enough at it to avoid a certain amount of frustration when my draws persistently avoid any of the N tiles I'd really like to have at that point in time. I get the feeling that if I were better, I'd be able to play such that I could productively use whatever I drew. If my impression is true, this game is fantastic, and I'll probably boost it a point or so. If I'm wrong, then it's just arbitrarily frustrating at times, and I'll probably drop it a point or so.

The game that officially started my board gaming career and the downward spiral of my financial situation due to purchasing large amounts of cardboard :). I have to confess I did play Descent: JitD and Starcraft before(both of which I really enjoyed) but this was the game I first played at an official boardgaming event and the one after which my collection was formed.

A good strategy game that plays in a short time. The rules are simple to explain and new players get the hang of it really fast but despite all that there's a lot of strategic decisions to be made in the game and it's really important to spend your tokens wisely and when the time is right.

Samurai is the type of game i wish i had created. It is layed out and put together so cleverly and seemingly so well balanced that it's hard to be upset when you take a loss.

Due to the nature of the game, it always seems to come down to the last turn that decides the winner.

Samurai is the type of game i wish i had designed.

Easy to learn, quick to play, and every decision you make feels absolutely critical to your success. It's agonizing in the best way. I'm not sure I can think of another highly strategic area control or tile-laying game that is so immediately satisfying. There is a little voice inside of me (the "epic gamer") that nags at me, trying to get me to dislike Samurai because the gameplay is so simple. But this game is good enough that I'm able to ignore it--and for me, that's saying a lot.

I've been getting a lot of play out this one. It is a tile-placer that still feels a bit like a wargame because you are surrounding and capturing places. This is nice because it seems to give me a bit of a wargame fix with people who do not like wargames. Very easy to pick up and learn and the strategy is deep enough and the scalability is good enough to make it a nice not too long game for any number of players from 2-4

My 2nd eurogame. 

Compared to Puerto Rico, this was a lot simpler to learn the rules of. 

I felt a bit annoyed that the screen doesn't list the numbers of each unit type - having that information would have helped me immediately know the relative strength of each number without need for familiarisation or memory issues.

As with the 'hidden' information in Puerto Rico and Taj Mahal, I could imagine a serious player trying to remember the scores. Part of me felt like I SHOULD be remembering all this - it felt unnatural to have game-pertinent information at my fingertips and just 'wilfully' forget it.

Though I agree with Ian that - having forgotten the scores - the scoring method adds some tension, I'd definitely try to remember them in a later game if playing to win.

Despite the inherent randomness of 3+ player games, the shuffled cards and group politics, it felt like a fairly 'pure' strategic game to me. It felt a lot closer to Blokus or Draughts than to something like Puerto Rico.

RATING: 6
Tile laying game of majority scoring. Three scoring categories (rice, Buddhas, and helmets), all represented by pieces on the board. When all land spaces surrounding one or more pieces are filled with tiles, pieces are awarded to the player with the most points on tiles of the corresponding scoring category, but only the tiles adjacent to that space count. Object is to score most of at least two of the three categories. And then some other tie breakers that push players to get some of the other scoring categories as well. 

I find it to be a decent game, but not great. There are some special tiles that you can play extra on your turn which can really change things up, but ultimately, it's just a tile-laying game and a little too abstract for me to like more. No other real mechanics to explore here.

I have only played a two-player version of this Reiner Knizia game, but find it thoughtful and strategic with minimal luck involved. I am interested in trying this out with a full complement of four players to see how the turn order fairs before it gets back to playing again. As real estate on the maps can get clogged up quickly, I am afraid that your strategy may lose something with three other players jockeying for prime spaces before your turn rolls around again. Team play may be interesting as a variant May rearrange rating based on later plays.

[after two 4 player and one 3 player game] I finally got to play this game last night and it was a blast.  It was very tense throughout.  I'm not very good at keeping track of how many of each piece each player has captured and I was surprised to find that I had won the game with 4-3-3 (2nd place had 4-3-2).  The game seemed very tactical to me.  My plans evolved as the game progressed.  I started out by focusing on the Buddhas, but toward the end of the game the High Hats became available so I started capturing those and ended up with a majority of them.  The special tiles also add some interesting twists to the game.  I hope I can get more plays of this game in soon.  It looks like it scales from 2 to 4 players well because of the modular board.  Pretty simple game to explain, too.  It's likely that my rating will go up rather than down with more plays. [update 2/10/06: after 3 plays I find no reason to lower my rating, would play this again pretty much anytime.]

Samurai is like a thematically rich, diceless wargame.  I find that it encourages a sense of quiet contemplation; from the serenity of the woodblock print style of the artwork to the ebb and flow of the gameplay as tiles are committed and sacrificed and thrusts are made to capture critical pieces, I think it perfectly captures the idea of a struggle for power through support of the castes in medieval Japan.  The reason I don't rate this a 10 is the fact that a weak player often adds unpredictabile chaos to what is otherwise a very analytical game (though, I suppose, the same could be said of many games).

Traded away for Legacy: The Testament of Duke De Crecy.  NZ Math Trade Feb 2017.

Very enjoyable "think through each move" type game.  Lacks the player interaction and social aspect that everyone loves in Catan.  However, can be quite "social" if one player has AP, and the other players chat while waiting for him/her to make their move.

Fairly intuitive game, except for Knizia's odd scoring mechanism at the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Those who say that any Knizia creation is a scoring system looking for a game must have had Samurai in mind. This is a pedestrian area influence game during which your chief strategy is to avoid setting up another player --- until you get to the final scoring, which is odd and favors players with better memories. Odd scoring works if a game's nature requires it, but it just seems arbitrary here. That's a long way of saying that I think this game is overrated. It probably merits a five, but I bump it to six because of the outstanding production.

An excellent game I'm surprised I don't enjoy more.  Focus on one suit: strategic.  Play tiles to take the pieces you need while not setting up your opponents: tactical.  The problem I have is that at some point, late-middle game, the decisions break down and the game becomes very deterministic.  I play here, you must play there, I must then play here and so on...  Soulless.

After reading Samurai's rules, I didn't really know what to expect. But since I'm a Knizia-Fanboy, I had high hopes that the doctor would surprise me again. And what can I say; after placing the first two or three tiles, I was hooked. It's unbelievable how much tension can be created with only 20 tiles, the inclusion of a few special tiles and a dead simple rules set. This one feels like a classic!

RATING: 8
An awesome and incredibly nerve wracking game.

IMO this game is kind of like an inverse version of Go; Go is a game of efficient plays where true skill is found is setting up areas to fall with the least amount pieces and direct attention. Samurai is a game where once you start contesting an area, you had better see it through to completion before moving on, lest the resource get captured by your opponent(s). In samurai, once a resource has been taken, there is no getting back. 

A particularly nerve wracking dimension is knowing your opponents have exactly the same tools at their disposal as you, including all the same screwage tiles. Each game is always anticipating some crushing disappointment somewhere. 

Finally, with more and more players, the amount of time between turns becomes unbearable as you see your good plays thwarted and canceled by the other players moves.

I love this game.

The weakest part of the Knizia's tile laying trilogy, but still an excellent game. It's as tense and exciting as the other two, with the rules just as simple, the only problem is that it can suffer, since bad moves from one player present opportunities only for the player sitting next to him and nobody else. This may hinder the enjoyment somewhat. But if you have similarly experienced players, you can't go far wrong with this one. It also looks very pretty.

Great game. The board and pieces are nicely themed even if the mechanics are essentially abstract.

Clever tile laying game from Reiner Knizia.  Everyone plays with an identical tile set, but with a limited tile pool.  The tiles are played to try and build up majorities of influence around victory tokens, but you only qualify for victory if you score an outright majority in one of the spheres.  Clever stuff and one that requires a bit of thought.

Samurai is one of my favourite Knizias, and deservedly so. Marvellously tight tile led area control game. Short, fun; I often play two games back to back, and on one weird occasion maybe ten times back to back. It's quite compulsive, I also find it spookily thematic, same with T&E. Great components in either edition, though I prefer the melamine, or whatever, of the original. And great at all player counts. A go to 45 minute game with a bit of headiness to it makes it a stone cold winner in my book. 



Great with two.

I played this game with the wrong strategy each time I played it, maybe it helped that each time I came close to taking something, someone else hopped in and took it.

This is an excellent game.  Sometimes I find it a little overanalytical, but when I'm in the mood it can be a perfect strategy fix.  I think I like it slightly better than Through the Desert.
I find this game unusual when played with 3 iun that it's not necessarily good for you when the other 2 people go at it and leave you alone, as you will often spend too many tiles to capture peices entirely by yourself.

Multi-player chess with light math. For some reason, the end-game scoring method *just* strikes that one portion of my brain: I can never remember how it works, even if you tell me over and over. It's a solid game: I just don't like it.

Yet another expertly crafted game from my favorite designer, Reiner Knizia. Tight board with any player count, with sparse resources to control few points. Classic Reiner elements: the touch of randomness from the tile-draw, the unique scoring system that encourages getting a diverse collection of points.

Deeply envious of those with the reprint - looks gorgeous, but I'll continue to enjoy my older version until funds allow for an upgrade (I'd need a pretty sizable windfall to justify such a purchase!)

One of the fancy new reprints of classic Knizia titles which I've been collecting. Brilliant design, offering a thought provoking game of consistently interesting decisions and gamesmanship. Makes you feel clever. Not a long game, making it ideal as a kind of medium weight filler. Leaves you analysing your game, considering what you'd have done differently whilst also appreciating your opponent's moves.

UPDATE: Convinced the 3-way tie was a complete aberration after I realized we didn't end the game correctly. Bumping rating back up. 

UPDATE: Wow, I'm dropping this down to a 6 because of a 3-player game where we all tied. It's hard to get a more unsatisfactory feeling after a good hour of brain-burning. I'm sure it's rare, but it really soured me on the game. Won't play again for awhile. 

After the first few plays, my reaction was that it was too similar to other Knizia games. After several more plays I have been drawn in much more and find the game to be deeper than I first imagined. I really like the board.

The beauty of this game is that it's incredibly easy to learn, and completely screws me over every time I play. I prefer 2-3 player games so I have a reasonable chance of knowing what's going on. This would really rank higher if the scoring at the end was a little clearer.

RATING: 9
Fantastic. It blends the strategic feeling of a perfect-information board game with the tactical feeling of an information-limiting card game. It maintains steady tactical, strategic, and endgame tension. Every one of your 20 pieces feels valuable. The pressure to slowly dominate the spaces around what you want is counteracted by the opportunity to quickly fill the last spaces around other players' nearly-surrounded pieces. Packs some satisfying thinking into an hour or less.

Clever game with a great look, even if the theme is rather tacked-on. Plays best with 2 or 3. Can suffer from analysis paralysis if the mood or players are wrong. 

The victory conditions are awful and some gray areas exist as written. Nothing like engaging in a long, grueling game of wits only to engage in a discussion on rules interpretation to decide who won. 

Also, this is the type of game where the more time you spend staring at the board, the better you'll do. In general, I dislike these types of games. In this one, you'll need to compute every possible move your opponents might make based on the pieces they have not played yet (which means you have to spend time scanning the board to see what's already in play) in order to do well. 

In brief, I still like this game, but I think it's overrated.

FFG edition.

Wonderfully simple, yet with tons of depth.  Enough has been said about this game, so I'll speak more on this edition - everything is fantastic.  The artwork is great and the multi-piece board is beautiful and streamlined.  Nothing is left to any confusion in this edition and even the caste pieces are finely-detailed molds.  I prefer the more abstract pieces from earlier editions, but these are very nice as well.

Very good game.

Samurai is an interesting game where you try to capture statues. Collecting statues is fun. You try to get the majority. There are 3 kinds of statues.

Deciding on who wins in Samurai is neat too. The are a lot of tie breakers which is good.

Samurai is one of my very first euro games in my board game collection. One of the other very first euro games is San Marco.

The Ronin tile can cause a surprise for a fast closing and multiple captures of statues. Especially since it's the only land tile which lets you put two land tiles on the same turn. 

Boats are also interesting for giving support to cities. It can be a difference if they are played right.

The exchange of statue and exhange of tile can really be nasty for someone at times. It is also fun to see someone's reaction whenever that happends during the game. Someone can really make the game turn around with these two tiles. Screwing a player with these two tiles can be easy.

really interesting tile, area control (very war-like) game , this is a very interesting, and, at times, brain taxing exercise -- very tactical, and very intriguing scoring system, one must achieve a balance in captured icons -- plays fast, but concentration is required to stay atop each move -- grand game, simple, elegant and would always play when tabled

RATING: 8
Incredibly thematic, but terribly confusing for new players. A very tense game of nabbing the powerful location and finishing up with scraps. Definitely best with more players, but I do not want to be the one to explain it to everyone. It's very difficult to understand if there is a leader until the game is all but finished and there isn't much anyone can do to change the outcome. That said, once players understand all the special tiles and the scoring mechanism, this is such a great game.

This has been one of the most played games in my collection over the years and I suspect that if I were to find the house on fire and I have a minute to grab an armful of games this would be the first one I'd reach for to save.

Why is this getting a 10?  It's my favorite of the Knizia's tile laying trilogy.  I'm not all that fond of E&T, and TtD, while I enjoy, just doesn't have that little extra something for me that Samurai has.

I suppose this is the perfect representative for a german game for me.  It scales well from 2-4 players, it plays in a fairly short period of time, the game system is elegant and induces painful decision making for the players, and it has quality game components that evoke german "exellence".

In terms of gameplay it hits the right spot for my mind.  Hard decision making, but it doesn't go so far that I feel I'm doing a brain burner.  There is just enough information for me to make good guesses on what to do next and how to react to other's play, but not so much that I'd need to be a savant to compete.

In the end I feel I get a quality gaming experience from Samurai.  It's still got lets after all these years and hundreds of other games in my collection to distract me.  I've yet to introduce it to someone who had anything but praise for the experience.

A really excellent tile-laying / area control game from Knizia. Among his tile-laying trilogy, I'd rate this the second best (after Tigris & Euphrates). Unfortunately my normal gaming partners don't terribly like this kind of game and thus I have parted ways with my copy. I'll still happily play it with others at meetups or cons though.

Traded away for a copy of Imhotep via a math trade.

UPDATE: I have to take Samurai down a notch because gameplay is very restricted by player order, like Puerto Rico. I'd really rather feel like I'm playing a game with everyone at the table, instead of waiting for the player to my left to screw up so I can take advantage of it. I still think it's a brilliant game though.

A very good game of tile placement and positioning. Elegant rules and great depth. The scoring system, while awkward, makes for some very interesting dilemmas.

There's a computer version out there, and it's worth looking for.

In Samurai, the theme gets easily overridden by mathematical calculation of the best tile placement. However, nothing is more satisfactory and thematic than bringing in your sea troops and steal some rice fields and temples under the nose of the opponent. The lightness of the theme is on the borderline of being too light, but not quite crossing it. Very balanced and exciting conquering mechanic together with the geographically fitting shape of the board makes this game a very replayable classic. But still, if I'd want to have more thematic experience in feudal Japan, I'd turn towards Shogun.

We always play with two.  The board increases proportionately for additional players. By the time you have 4 players it's almost a different game owing to having 3 other players' moves to consider.  With two, it's more directly strategic.

Muy bueno!! Combinamos un juego fácil de jugar, fácil de explicar pero que tiene cierta complejidad, no todo es tan sencillo como parece. Además es bastante rapidito.
Las condiciones de vistoria son originales y hasta el último momento no sbremos quien ganará.
Muy indicado para adentrar en "la ludopatí­a sana" a nuevos jugadores.

Para ganar: utiliza bien las fichas comodines; a mí­ en particular la de cambiar las materias de sitio me parece muy pero que muy buena, los barcos también. Debemos intentar dominar una materia para optar a ganar (si jugamos 4, con 4 casi seguro que domines ese recurso y con 5 fijo)

Horas de diversión garantizadas!!!!

PARTIDAS:
04/04/2008 4 jugadores (Pi, Juas, Tyrion y Gato).Empiezo yo (Gato) que pongo el Samurai de 3 el la aldea principal(Tokio) y el barco de 2 entre 2 arroces con el fin de dominar desde el principio el preciado cereal; perooooo, Pi hace lo mismo que yo y Juas algo parecido (también en el primer turno) con lo cual ya empiezo bastante puteado; allá donde voy colocando los valores más altos allá es donde me van puteando, unas veces unos y otras otros pero sobretodo Tyrion. Al final de la partida sólo opta a victoria Tyrion porque es la que más "tricornios" tiene; luego hay empates a 5 "arroces" (Pi y Gato) y a "Budas" (5 cada uno, Juas y Tyrion); Ganadora, y aunque me duela decirlo... TYRION!!!!  Que bueno es este juego!!!!!

Feels like a bit of a sleeper.  My one play went absolutely horribly, but the game is calling me for another play.  Undoubtedly, the gorgeous art production and pasted-on Japanese theme are alluring.  The gameplay is typically Knizian, solid and sound although I've not warmed to this CCG style of action limitation in this game - the full stack of actions with a few available choices drawn at random.  Definitely want to give it another go.  For some reason, Through the Desert has become my Mendoza Line of short fillers, and this one feels like it will finish above.

RATING: 8
Samurai is a very elegant game that like many successful games, is simple in play, yet deep in tactics.  With two players, the winner usually does so by capturing the majority in two categories, so the quirkiness of the scoring system is less of an issue.  With more than two, the scoring system at first seems very obtuse and almost random, especially at first. With more experience though, the scoring actually becomes an integral part of the strategy and you need to carefully watch the other players' captured pieces and adjust your plans

What makes this game shy of a full 10 points for me, is the lack of flexibility in the set up.  This creates a small sense of sameness, especially with the competition for Edo.  Nevertheless Samurai is a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun game that scales beautifully between 2 and 4 (although there is no guessing on majority wins with two players). Nerve-wracking decisions to be made, and there's always the element of having something stolen from under your nose. A truly great game.

Finally played this again after avoiding it for years. I played Samurai when I first got into german games and I really disliked it. Years have passed, and do you know, I'm a better player and I actually enjoy the games I previously hated. So my rating has gone from 4 to 6. I still played poorly, but it is much simpler than I remembered and I'll be okay playing this again.

Knizia's tile-laying classic.  The dark plexiglass components add a nice appeal.  It's easy to learn, yet highly strategic.  The computer version is VERY well done with standout graphics and a terrific new-age soundtrack.  Samurai is a little masterpiece with a lot to think about.  Grade: B+

I only have 3 plays thus far.  I love how simple, quick and yet wide open this game is.  I probably won't play this one that often though as my wife found it too dry and strategic.  She killed me on play 1, but the pattern with more strategic 1 on 1 is that I end up winning too often.  I think it would be more fun for her and myself with more players.

Okay tile laying game.  

Scoring is interesting as if you had the most in any category your score is the number of pieces you got in the other categories, requiring you to have a somewhat balanced approach.

I've played only a handful of times but I really like this game and think it will rise with more plays.  I'm very happy to own it and look forward to learning more!  It really plays quickly as well.

Update:  I've played it quite a bit and I love it.  I prefer it to Through the Desert and Tigris.  To me it's not as dry as those two and is much prettier. Playtime is short and sweet and I like how the game makes you balance and spread around the board to win. Blue Moon City also has that 'try to balance' feel to me but Samurai is more streamlined.  Like Medici, it has that simple, boiled down feel that rewards you with something deep out of a fairly simple gameplay process.  Of course I'm in this hobby for the bits and boards as well and Samurai is a distinctive looking game with great components.  I like the random tile draw, and enjoy the dash of randomness that exists in so many great Knizia games like Samurai and Tigris.

I was hesitant to pick this one up after reading that this game suffered from "boxes" syndrome. (The game with the dots and you connect them to make boxes. You never want to be the person to draw the 3rd line in a box) Well, I disagree. There is so much more to this game than meets the eye. Easy to learn, but a game of great tactics. The 2 special tiles throw some interesting curves into the game too. Plays great with any number since the board changes depending on the number of players. Another winner from Knizia and a worthy entry into the tile laying trilogy. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
[Tile-laying, Set collection, Time] [2P:7, 3P:9, 4P:8] Reiner likes to do all sorts of things with tiles and time. His 3-part Tile Laying Trilogy is exquisite in that each has time as an overarching theme to the mechanisms, but none of them implement it in quite the same way. Durch die Wuste, Through the Desert, plays time as opportunity. Do it now, and be certain, or do it later and hope no one blocks you. Euphrat & Tigris ties time with its tiles - the more tiles you burn through the less time you have until the game ends. So more war, more revolutions, less time. Samurai is the waiting game. Patience melds with positioning to produce situations where your opponents have no choice but to do your will and play their tiles where you want them to. It's just a matter of time. The brilliant, austere graphic design choices add to the atmosphere of the game, which implements several very Japanese tenets to enhance the gameplay. The basic mechanism of encirclement of cities, towns and villages to capture influence is very much in the spirit of Japanese strategy. The very simple rules - play exactly one regular tile and as many quick (shock troop) tiles as you wish on your turn - make the game a pleasure to teach. The thematic "ninja" tiles are simple and yet powerful. And that power is most embodied in the 1-power Ronin, the most fearsome unit at each Daimyo's disposal. The much-discussed scoring rules and winning conditions fit the game like a glove. Broad support from all three spheres of influence is necessary to win. And yes, ties are possible. There is no shame in a battle where you meet someone who is your equal. All in all, this is Reiner at his best - Samurai is a game that is thematic, beautiful, easy to learn, always interesting to play and provides immense replay value. Highly recommended. (And yes, I do like Samurai more than I like Durch die Wuste.)

Classic Knizia. A great abstract game about using your hand of tiles wisely to surround 3 types of scoring pieces on the board. This game hits the perfect balance of presenting interesting decisions without being an absolute brain-burner, and the luck of how each person`s tiles come out keep the best player from winning every single time.

Reiner Knizia does it again.  It's simply a surround/control-style strategy game, but with great bits, great theme, and great style.  And it plays with 4 in about a half hour.  Great scaling of the game - a different sized map for 2, 3, or 4!!  Man, I love this one.  The win conditions can seem a little fiddly, but I can't imagine how else you would do it.  I had rated it a 9 for a while, but after a bunch more of playing it, I have to just give it a 10.  And I always, always, always lose.  To me, that's a good game -- I can do poorly, and it's still enjoyable to play.

O tabuleiro é formado por ilhas definidas por uma malha hexagonal. Nós devemos colocar nossos marcadores (hexágonos) de influência em volta das cidades. Estes marcadores têm números e tipos que representam a força e tipo de inflência deles. Cada cidade tem um, dois ou três tipos de itens. Quando a cidade for cercada por marcadores de influência quem tiver mais força em cada um desses itens recebe os itens que definirão o vencedor no final do jogo. Basicamente disputa de área. O jogo parece ser bem legal. Nós jogamos com algumas regras erradas que, tenho certeza, mudaram bastante a graça do jogo. Na próxima eu confirmo. Não posso deixar de comentar o material e a qualidade gráfica da edição brasileira que deixou a desejar mas ainda assim estou pensando em comprá-lo.

Nagyon jól kitalált, egyszerű ám mégis gondolkodós tile placement, területfoglalós játék. 
A játékban a térlképen lávő városok körülépítése a feladat. Amikor egy város körülépült, akkor kiértékelődik. A várost az a játékos  szerzi meg, akinek a város típusához illeszkedő befolyása a nagyobb a város körül. A játék végén az nyer, akinek a lehető legöbb várostípusból többsége lesz (nála lesz a legtöbb, abból a típusból). Kb. ennyi a szabály, és a játék mégis nagyon szórakoztató.

Két negatívumot tudok megemlíteni:
1. a hajók megtalálása a táblán nagyon nehézkes, mert nem üt el elégggé a színük.
2. Az hogy titkos, hogy kinek milyen városa van szerintem egy kicsit felesleges memóriajátékos elemet visz a játékba. De ezt még egy játék után, azért nem merem biztosan állítani. :)

-------------
Pár új játék után (2 személyes) kicsit több szerencse szerepet érzek már benne. Ha valaki az elején felhúzza a hármas samurait és még valami kisebbeket, akkor nagyon nehezen behozható előnyre tesz szert, mivel jó eséllyes elviszi a teljes hármas települést.

Samurai feels pretty abstract to lay tiles around the cities.  It scratches my chess playing itch, although it is considerably lighter than chess due to a) short playing time, b) a little luck of the draw, and c) imperfect information about what tiles your opponent has and what pieces he/she has won.

Of the Knizia "tile laying" games this is my favorite.  Every turn is packed with decisions and just a little luck.  It scales well across the 2-4 player range.  Elegant pieces and modular board.

RATING: 7
This game is about placing tiles to gain influence on and ultimately collect sets of figurines. The Samurai connection is feeble at best.

Anyway, the scoring mechanism is unusual and somewhat typically Knizia-esque. Distributing your tiles optimally with regards to the figurines you want to collect, while not overly deep (I'd say a level or two above Ingenious), offers enough of a challenge to keep things interesting while at the same time not being overly prone to AP. That makes Samurai a very quick game which packs quite a punch for that time frame.

The components are great. This is the prettiest game I own. Unfortunately, the first few rounds often feel pointless to beginners, and the later rounds do not pay this deficit back with more excitement or anything. The setup and early play simply feels arbitrary. People have asked to play a second time, but no one has asked me specifically to bring it to a session. 

I would recommend a Stefan Feld game over this. Most of them may be a little more complicated, but they are much more exciting than the pace of this game. One thing that I continue to love about this game are the fleet tiles and the other two tiles that don't end your turn when you play them. Managing your tiles, including you starting tiles, is very fun.

SAMURAI stammt aus einer Ära, in der Spiele von Dr. Knizia zum Besten gehörten, was man als Vielspieler damals auf den Tisch bekam: Zeug wie AMUN-RE, TADSCH MAHAL und eben SAMURAI gehören auch heute noch zu Spielen, die problemlos gealtert das heutige Kompliziert- und Komplexniveau mit einer genialem Idee gekonnt unterlaufen. SAMURAI ist ein regeleinfaches Mehrheit- und Werteplättchenlegespiel um drei Figurenarten aus haptischer Anmut auf einer gebogenen, himmelblauen, in cremefarbener Schönheit an Inseln reichen Japankarte mit einer intelligenten Schlusswertung, die Taktik in einen seidenen Kimono kleidet. Vermutlich würde man SAMURAI heute weniger oppulent bei einem Kleinverlag in eine kleine Schachtel verpacken und es würde immer noch als gutes Insider-Spielchen seine Freunde finden. SAMURAI verdient es öfters auf den Tisch zu kommen, als es sein Alter vorgaukelt. Danke für 20 gute Jahre. Wir schreiten alle einer senioren Gesellschaft entgegen.

Samurai seems as dry a game as you could possibly find, but somehow Knizia squeezes some beautiful tension out of basic arithmetic. We tend to play with open scoring, but open hands fell flat with my family. I can live with this compromise.

[2015.08.20]
Beautifully simplistic game, with a bit of a burr by way of the tie-breaking mechanism.  That said, I suspect that this will eventually come out on top for my favorite Knizia's.  It has a nice amount of tension and is one of the few Knizia games that I don't mind playing close-handed (though I play with open scoring).

Another wonderfully thought out Reiner Knizia game.  From the expansive board, to the shiny piece design, to the seamless game play, Samurai a quick-action, area influence game that is a whole lot of fun.

I have to admit the end game of this is one of my favorites.  It's a wonderful feeling looking across the table when you have won and announce yourself as soverign.  The game itself is an interesting area control struggle.  The components add a lot to the feel, and the game play is quick and tense.  Not my favorite of Knizia, but a solid title.

UPDATE: Time changes a lot, and it has too with my perception of Samurai.  About a decade ago Knizia was making the best games out there, and had an impressive string of titles that still really have no equal.  My many years now of playing Euros has lead me back to the start.  I believe the late nineties, and very early days of the new millenium to be the golden days of Euro design, and Knizia was at the helm.  Games today have become too convoluted, too over wrought, and lacking in real game play.  There are a few out there but they tend to imitate the earlier designs.  Recent playings of Samurai have proven to me the amazing game that it truly is.  Depth and simplicity, and aesthetically beautiful and reconfirms my thoughts above.

I [b]Samurai[/b] kæmper man om indflydelse over tre forskellige typer af indbyggere symboliseret ved hjelme, buddhaer og rismarker. For at være med i opløbet om sejren forudsættes det, at man ved spillets afslutning har majoritet indenfor en af tre typer af indbyggere. Ens score afgøres dog af alle de indbyggere man har fået kontrol over med undtagelse af dem i den kategori, man har majoritet i. Så man bliver altså på den ene siden nødt til at specialisere sig for at være med i opløbet om sejren men på den anden side afgøres ens point af at man ikke har specialiseret sig for meget.

[b]Samurai[/b] er et elegant spil, der takket være en spilleplade med variabel størrelse skalerer fint mellem to og fire spillere. Det er i bund og grund en brainburner af den bedste eller værste skuffe alt efter smag og behag. Umiddelbart syntes spillet ikke at være blevet bedre med årene... måske er konkurrencen fra de mange nyere spil bare for hård. I hvert tilfælde forekommer spillet mig i dag at være for abstrakt brainburner-agtigt med to spillere. Med tre eller flere er det ikke mindre brainburner-agtigt, men her frygter jeg, at det kan gå helt galt, da der mellem ens ture kan ske alt for mange ting, man ikke kan kontrollere. Spillet har i hvert tilfælde fået opdateret sin score på BGG for mit vedkommende og er p.t. nedskrevet med 1½ point. Forhåbentlig kan det med tiden genvinde lidt terræn, men jeg er ikke sikker på, at det vil lykkedes for det.

An abstract game that looks very cool being played. Basically playing different tokens around cities trying to be the one with the most influence over it when it is surrounded. If you do, you capture the piece. Has that wierd Knizia scoring thing. Fun and scales very well. More people, more islands.

 Now. The most beautiful game I own. Plexiglass bits are intriguing and full of elegance. The idea of puzzle-like connecting board parts is ingenious. The board itself is as elegant as the bits. All together feels a bit taoistic and zen-like. 

Samurai is a pure abstract strategy or rather tactic game. But it's simple and really brilliant. 

There is a nice learning curve for this one. 
First you just learn what does the tokens do, when and where to use them. You start to create your own ideal starting combination and find that the placement of figures is the little pregame in the game.
Then you find that using some combinations of tokens could change the board situation drastically. You start to analyze what tokens are still in the stack waiting to be revealed - here comes the ,,probability" aspect of the game.
Great!

It's a very tense, but a little bit more chaotic game for 4. Need to check with 3.
===
Edit: After second game with 4 rating rised to 9.2. You have to learn how to play with more players, cause new tactics and strategies have to be used.

The first board game I purchased.  
I think it's a very fun 2 player game, but really shines in a bigger group.  Best of all, it's a very quick game, so if you're losing, take heart - it's quick and painless! 

After many games, I've decided that this is best as a 3-player game, provided all 3 players are equally skilled.  It's a surprisingly tense affair, as long as no one screws up repeatedly and gives the person on his/her left a lot of victories.  

Hell has frozen over...my mother really enjoys this game.

Does not make me feel like a Samurai, or a Daimyo, for that matter. However, a very good strategic game, being a bit chess-like.

One of Knizia's best, IMHO.

An area control game that somehow doesn't feel like it.  Plays in only about an hour, yet still manages to offer some tough decisions.  Beautiful components; this is one of the most attractive games in my collection.

I feel that the luck of the tile draw plays a pretty strong role in determining the winner.  If you have the right tiles at the right time, it's easy to pull off the big plays; conversely, if your tile draws are poorly timed then it is hard to play well.

Positives: 1 hour play time, easy to get people to play.  Screens conceal how well people are doing (must remember who captures what).  A very interesting win condition which can mean the person who captures the most icons doesn't win.  Interesting intial set-up, player controlled so you can start working your strategy before the game even starts.Negatives: As with all Reiner games the motif has no real bearing on the game play or mechanics (oh well), can easily slow if players suffer from AP (analysis paralysis!)

A very simple game to learn and teach, but yet has a lot of good strategy and depth. It plays just as well with two players, as it does with four. It can be a little thinky at times, which may lead to some minor AP, but after a few games. I don't think it'll be as bad.

The components look great and are very well made. Those black onyx looking pieces are awesome. This is a very good game and I'd highly recommend it to everyone.

Tack on theme, gameplay isn't inspiring, fairly simple and I didn't see the strategy in it till late in the game.  There are too many variables in the early stages to have any really coherent strategies.  But in the middle & late game it does improve.  Not my cup of tea.  So only a 5.

[b]Samurai[/b] [i]Reiner Knizia 1998[/i]
Samurai is a tile placing game with really easy rules and room for a lot of tactical situations in which players must use their skills to get the victory. The scoring system is a typical Knizias one what means that the end game will depare a lot of surprises and though decisions. Its scalability is very good and the replayability is good. The board is a map of Japan that can be build using different configurations according to the number of players. Although you could think at first sight that is an easy game it has actually a lot of deep and rewards good and wise playing, and this is very good because its rules are really easy to grasp, almost the same level of difficulty of some fillers. A gem that worths its inclusion in any collection and is a very good choice for beginners and casual gamers.

RATING: 4.5
A game where everything you work for can be for nothing, depending on who gangs up on you (sometimes through incompetence).  The game often ends suddenly.  The flair of the game is being able to suddenly change the direction of the game abruptly, turning the strategy focus from one goal to another.  You don't know who is actually winning, unless there is a runaway victory over newbies.  Normally if you win, it's accidental or everyone else messed up to give you the victory.  The ability to suddenly end the game often suddenly appears, and the sense to forgo this honour is only rarely achieved, despite it normally throwing the game to someone else.  This is quite a complex game and if thought through properly should take quite a long time.  Instead it is treated as a parlour game, which it is if you don't care that you just let someone else win through a mindless move.  Personally I don't really care for Samura all that much.  It's just too easy to get run over by the other players who inadvertantly conspire against you in several of the small battles.

Bought March 2009. The game that got me back into gaming.

Back at the end of the Naughties I attended a board game meetup on a whim. I think it was Swiggers. We played a game of Samurai - and I was hooked.

I started slowly, but my interest in the board game hobby grew and grew until thousands of hours and pounds had been spent. No signs of slowing down yet.

So I owe a debt of gratitude to this smart and aesthetically pleasing game; but of Knizia's designs, lately [thing=118][/thing] and [thing=42][/thing] tend to be chosen over this one.

The theme is tacked on, but despite that, it's not a bad little game. It's very simple, easy to teach, and also has all right depth of strategy. While it's all right, it's not one I highly recommend. If you like a Japanese theme, and Knizia's games, you'll likely enjoy this one greatly. I expected a little more from this one, so that's likely why it was a bit of a let-down. I may change the rating as I play it a few more times.

This is another game I enjoy getting beat at. At some point I should probably take a stand against allowing some rabid ass to kick me out of my own rice paddies so he can move his Buddha in and take over what little dignity I had before we started playing. This is a fine tactical game that involves my spending several minutes to consider a futile move to exert influence on a particular city when the guy sitting next to me is just going to swoop in and take both the rice paddie and the high hat while sitting atop his high horse. I want to add a new dimension to this game: cannons, so I can shoot those doggoned ships out of the water so their influence means nothing to my samurai warriors!

RATING: 5
Gameplay rates a 4, but the visual presentation is an upper-deck homerun 10, which bumps my rating to 5.  Samurai fails to excite me because it feels very static.  I can't really do anything very interesting on the board, I'm mainly just trying to keep my options open and flexible, set up some future opportunities, and avoid handing the golden goose to my left-hand neighbor.  None of that interests me much.  It feels sort of like I'm playing the pencil and paper game Dots and Boxes, in which the player who closes out a box wins the point.  In Samurai, the player who places the final tile and initiates scoring has so much power that the whole affair becomes a waiting game.  Everyone goes around the table making safe moves, waiting for an opponent to open the door for them to make their move.

Then there's the scoring. Knizia is without question the master of creating balanced, complex, and unstraightforward scoring mechanisms.  It's a tool he uses to enrich gameplay by making it tough for the players to pinpoint the value of an action, a tile, a card, a token, a point, a buck, a gizmo, or whatever.  But I think he overreached in Samurai; the arcane victory conditions screw up the game because they're just too opaque.  It's not really possible to form a heuristic for good play without memorizing the other players' figure counts.  If your mental count is off by just one figure, your carefully-planned winning play may actually forfeit the victory to an opponent.  For this reason, I recommend playing with the captured figures in front of the player screens.  The scoring system is still too unstable, but it will help enormously those who want to play intelligently without having to memorize as many as nine separate running totals.

I don't enjoy this one as much as Tigris & Euphrates but it is one I can play with the family. My daughter particularly likes it because she is a Japanophile (although the theme is wafer thin, that doesn't bother her). There are certainly some strategic considerations, and I'm sure I would appreciate them more if I gave it the time and effort to really study it, but at our level it seems a bit random and chaotic...which is fine for playing with the family and I don't have a burning need to go beyond that.

As expected, Samurai is abstract, but at least the theme makes sense.  It's mathematical and surprisingly simple, so it plays quickly, while still having a lot of tough choices to make.  Luck may play a greater part than I'm normally willing to admit, but still a solid, good game.

The first 3 plays (only 2 player since my yellow and blue tokens weren't in the box!  Rio Grande have shipped some replacemetns very promptly) have been very entertaining.  This is a very tactical game and reminds me of Go in a very loose way (maybe why Knizia chose the theme he did?).  It has shown me that even with random buddha, helm, and rice placement and random starting hands, a more experienced player will certainly defeat a novice.  Learning the strengths of all your tiles and when to use them is key to winning this game.

Whenever I teach new players this game, they often seem intimidated by everything, but when I tell them that if you can count to ten, you can master this game, they laugh, but by the end, they agree. Every move has impact on the board and the depth of strategy of when to use certain tiles while keeping track of what your opponents may have make this my favorite Knizia game that I have played. The board is absolutely beautiful and the pieces look great too. The theme is pretty much tacked on, but I do appreciate it being Japan. Fantastic game.

Fun, but not as good as its brothers, T&E and through the desert.  Samurai seemed more tactical/less strategic than its older brothers.  The mechanism where you get screwed for tying someone sucks.  Actually, the entire scoring mechanism of this game is bad, and I'm someone that usually loves the odd scoring mechanisms.  I normally really like knizia tile placing games, but this fell flat for me.  I probably won't play it again.  Totally themeless.  Didn't even really understand the theme that was pasted on.  There is rice that you fight over...  ok?  The way scoring works, you are only vaguely rewarded for good play.  Tying another good player could screw you hard. Weird design.  The great components almost make up for the total lack of theme, but cant make up for the oddities in the design.

Classic Knizia. A game that masquerades as a perfect information game with a variable set-up but has just enough variability through tile draw to not make the outcome discernible before the game begins (as can be the case with pure perfect information games when players are not on even playing fields, for diverse reasons). Simple rules, elegant play, and creative scoring make this game easy to get into. However, as the good doctor always does, easy to learn does not always mean easy to master. While the interaction might not be as rich as Tigris and Euphrates, the choke points are more obvious - which can make even a first play contentious! Not to mention how aesthetically pleasant and functional the board and the bakelite pieces are. 

Here's hoping for a FFG reprint in their new Euro Classics line.

[I've rated this using the BGG recomended ratings.] Very easy to learn. Scales very well: a great 2 player game. While the theme is thin, it nevertheless works for me; I get a kind of oriental feel when I play. This probably has a little bit to do with the very fine quality of the components. It can be prone to AP if that's the way you want to play it. While there is an element of luck involved, I feel that one has more control than, say, in Carcasonne.

[Initial Impression: 8]
Samurai is a truly excellent area-influence game that scales well from 2 to 4 players.  The scoring system feels a bit odd at first, but once you've learned it, the system seems natural and sets up some interesting strategies (i.e., don't devote more effort to collecting a given type of figure once you have a plurality).  The bits are great (especially those little buddhas!), and the variety of tiles provides plenty of opportunity for strategic planning and for tense tactical decisions. I find the two-player game to be much more thought-provoking, tense, and competitive than with higher player counts, probably because I can more easily track the current score and try to plan out the best possible move.  One drawback is the randomness of the tile draw, which can limit your options at critical points - it might be interesting to try a variant where each player has all tiles available from the start (you might also need to impose a limit of one special character tile per turn), although this could slow the game down considerably.

2 - 4 players (may be best with 2 or 3)

I really like this Knizia game where players place tiles that give them influence in one or more of the three branches of society.  It plays quickly as long as people don't ponder their turns forever (I'm guilty of that sometimes).  If you play with 4 people, there is a tendency for one player to get screwed.

An excellent CLASSIC from the math genius in the gaming world! I got the FFG copy simply because I am still relatively new to the hobby.
 
But boy, it didn't disappoint! Even though I am paying for twice the price of a 1st ed copy (that pretty much didn't have any rule changes), I feel like I would definitely get my money's worth!

So simple yet so many options. It almost feels like chess on a 4p scale. Do you checkmate, check or stale? Stale some of your battles, and you could still win the war!

Many more replays to come for this one!

Classic Knizia - I have the reprint. Prefer the original version's more 'uncarved stone' scoring figurines and design.


This game is very simple to play, but somehow becomes quickly immersive. It has just the right amount of theme, length and depth of strategies to make people forget that it is an abstract game.

It feels too much like chess, especially with only two people. Some plays seem fairly deterministic. With three or four, it is slightly more interesting.

Update (02/24/11): Finally was "in the mood" after two years, but quickly recalled why I am reluctant to bring this to the table. If playing against capable opponents, it seems that most of the game is spent setting up for big plays, like winding up a clock... with pressure building up slowly and then bam! The last third of the game quickly resolves itself in a cascade-like fashion of falling dominos or a deflating balloon. Another player commented that, yes, it is mostly deterministic, although the hidden nature of tiles makes it interesting. With three or four players, suboptimal plays and mistakes from inexperience can be quickly magnified into huge swings for an experienced player. It is a great abstract, with a thinly pasted on theme, but just seems out of place with the other board games I have. It plays much heavier, if one takes this seriously, than its light ruleset suggests. It's a solid '5'.

Interesting and recommended variant: randomly place all scoring figures, and have all players randomly draw their first five tiles.

A pure abstract area influence game that has a beautiful theme pasted on. Simple and fast.

Easy to teach in under 10 minutes and I have yet to find anyone who would not have instantly liked it. And in addition I really like the board and the playing pieces.

Uno dei migliori giochi di posizionamento in assoluto. Essenziale e lineare, è un gioco di preparazione e attesa: ogni mossa ha la sua importanza e la sua ritualità. Bellissimo il meccanismo di individuazione del vincitore, che obbliga i giocatori a cercare la maggioranza in uno dei tre tipi di pezzi, premiando però chi ne ha di più nei restanti due tipi (meccanismo molto simile a quello di Tigri & Eufrate, sempre di Knizia). Eccellente la qualità dei pezzi, laccati di nero.

A solid 8.  Easy to learn, easy to play, and hard to make choices, with a touch of chaos (Drawing tiles) so that any well laid plans can go astray.

*Update* Reduced to a 6. After a lot of plays under my belt the games strategy becomes pretty evident and not nearly as exciting. Still good, just not an 8 any longer.

RATING: 8
First played March 26th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (~5min) and quick play (~45min for 4).  It has a good mixture of luck and strategy.  Your objective is to capture the most of one or two types of figures (Budda, Rice, High Hats)  Getting two you win.  If you get one, you are in the running.  Of those left, whoever has the most pieces of the figures they didn't have the most of, wins.  You capture the figures by placing tiles next to cities (gaining influence).  Once there are no land spaces left, the pieces are evaluated for ownership.  Figures go out of the game for ties.  You can play "quick" tiles to play more than one tile during your turn.  Each player normally plays one tile.  I'd strongly recommend giving this a try if you know someone who has it.  Give it consideration for purchase and for a spot in your rotation of regular game plays.

This game is very similar to Tigris & Euphrates in my eyes.  I think I prefer this one a lot more as the components are absolutely striking and the resolution of conflicts is instantaneous and much less fiddly (read: easy).  The ommitance of support tiles played from a player's hand ala T&E also gets rid of a lot of luck and makes the game more enjoyable as well.  Samurai also plays extremely fast, which is a plus in my book as you can get in a couple games for the price of pretty much any other single game.

So, I really like both T&E and TtD, so how does the 3rd in the tile laying trilogy work for me?  Meh.  It just doesn't have the same touch.  Of course, it took awhile for the other ones to grow on me, so I'll give this one a few more tries.

I actually like the detailed scoring mechanisms.  I also enjoy the healthy dose of conflict.  I suppose what really turns me off about it is how you can  invest resources and then lose them all.  It also has a bit of the whole "boxes" game, where you don't want to play there because then he'll play that.  I just don't enjoy playing games with those kind of feelings in them.

But then again, I could be missing something.

Nov17: Dusted it off and played with the kids again.  Was awesome even with kids.  Deserves a 10 to me.

Ideal Players: 2-4

Description: Vie for influence in feudal Japan in this simple tile-laying game. Players must have the most of one type of influence to be eligible to win, but are then scored on all other types.

Pro: Beautiful components. Chess-like strategy. Limited hand of tiles forces interesting choices. All players have an equal chance of winning (use the same tiles). Hidden information creates tension. Plays quickly.

Con: A little abstract.

Full disclosure: I only own this as an iOS game, although I understand it to be a faithful rendition. The app itself is quite nicely done.

A hexagonal tile placement game, the object of which is to capture key locations on the board (its shape vaguely resembling Japan). There’s a fair amount of thought as to where each piece should be placed; it’s deep enough to keep my attention.

I haven’t played it much, however, since I’m continually trounced by the AI (which doesn’t offer different skill levels). But I keep coming back to it occasionally.

After 8 plays on the computer this is a well thought out brilliant little abstract strategy with tile laying, set collection and area influence aspects. I think this game defines what people like to refer to in games as "elegant". This rates right up there with chess and go IMO, doesn't have anywhere near the depth but it scores points in other areas like 2-4 players, plays quickly with very little AP and it's just cool and quite fun. Neat scoring system and a "screw you" tile thrown in there for good measure. Awesome for 3 which I suspect is the sweet spot, not sure with 4 yet but 2 is still a very good little tactical battle. Some luck with the tiles but that keeps it interesting I think, variants could probably overcome this somewhat as well. If you like abstracts you should try the trial like I am, I'm hooked now!

[u]UPDATE[/u]:After 10 more plays and buying the board game it now feels like there isn't as much to explore anymore. Beautiful components and great little tactical game thats fun for the weeknights but lacking depth in the strategy department, also works as a gateway game, best with 3 but 2 and 4 great as well and still a weeknight favourite. Rating down slightly now from 8.75 => 8

This game was fine. It's the first proper Knizia game I've played, and I still don't really see the big deal. Words like 'deep' and 'elegant' get thrown around a lot to describe his games, but this one struck me as very tactical and near the end pretty calculable. The way the scoring works is interesting and makes things a bit less clear, but it also feels sort of artificial. Nice for an abstract gateway-ish game, but I have no idea how Knizia has the reputation he does if this is one of his classics.

Adictive & very original. Clever tile laying game from Reiner Knizia. Everyone plays with an identical tile set, but with a limited tile pool. The tiles are played to try and build up majorities of influence around victory tokens, but you only qualify for victory if you score an outright majority in one of the spheres. Clever stuff and one that requires a bit of thought.

I joined the hobby on 2010, and in that year, I liked most games I played, however I never liked Samurai. By my current standards, I should like the game, but for some reason I don’t. It was always boring for me.

I remember the game pieces were very well done, but the decisions weren’t very hard. As the game was reprinted last year, I think I will have the chance to play it again soon, and when I do, I will come back to do a proper comment. I don´t remember all the game nuances, last time I played it was on 2010.

We bought this and have played several times with 2 players, and it works well.
--------------------------------
We've only had one multiplayer session. Two first timers, two with more experience. We played with a random setup, which would change once we've played enough to get more subtle. The play flow had a really balanced and elegant feel of play vs counterplay, measured decisions vs mixed opposition, looking to create or find or block points of leverage. There were clearly better strategical choices to be made than some of the ones I picked along the way, but the tactical play was engaging from the word go. For my mind the game presentation meshes extremely well with the mood of the play. After one play, I want to buy this. Looks like it would scale well. The scoring outcome felt slightly chaotic.

I really enjoy the intuitive gameplay, balancing the various options you have against what the others following you might do with the situations you create. 

The scoring rules (in particular, that tied majorities don't count) can turn the game into a little bit of a lottery towards game end, unless you mentally record every piece captured by your opponents - which possibly is the good practice needed to win!

RATING: 8
Cleanly designed clever medium-weight abstract. The various parts of the game feel balanced and "mature". Not sure how Knizia does it, but the "special power" tiles add skill rather than making the game gimmicky. I usually hate abstract strategy games with themes; but here the nice bits add rather than detract from the experience. Refreshingly "old school" to have such nice heavy pretty pieces. Their  unusual shapes (helmets, rice paddies, Buddhas) are pleasing to the hand.

Samuari offers a rich blend of tactics, planning, and execution. Even the setup procedure and your initial tile selection involve careful decisions. The hidden pieces and final scoring mechanism provide the usual strokes of genius we've come to enjoy from Knizia. Gameplay is engaging, fast, and satisfying. Sure, the theme is stamped on, but otherwise this is just what I'm looking for in an abstract euro. The beautiful, high quality components in the FFG version make for a wonderful aesthetic experience.

Wow! This handsome looking game w/elegant components keeps getting better and better with every play.  A thoroughly satisfying (and frustrating!) game of area control and one that scales very well to 2-players.  Big plus!  The unique end-game scoring (as in E&T) focuses on selective majority rather than overall quantity.  

The PC game (v1.5.3) is a blast too, as well as the iPad.  =D

RATING: 8
This was my first eurogame. It has very well thought mechanics and scoring system (as most Knizia games do) but with a theme that, thought it was the first thing that got my attention, I realized was a bit pasted on top of what certainly is a abstract area control game. 

I have always played the PC version, and I must say that I don't like the components of the actual physical game... too monochromatic and boring compared with their virtual representations.

RATING: 7
Knizia tile-laying game where you play tiles around cities in Japan in order to claim token(s) placed on that city at the beginning of the game. There are three different kinds of tokens. The tiles range from 1-4 in value and have pictures of specific token or samurais (which are essentially wild and can influence any token). Once a city is surrounded, the player with the highest total value for that kind of token wins it. The player who collects the most tokens out of any type usually wins (or you have the most in two types, or you have the most total tokens, etc.). 

The game almost qualifies as an abstract in its simpicity. It's a clever game that rewards clever play, but it's not a deep or rich as Knizia's great tile-laying classic, Tigris and Euphrates. Once the cities around a token are claimed, the played tiles cease to have any meaning (other than to remind players what tiles are left). I think in great tile games (like T&E and Acquire) played tiles continue to influence play until the game's end. Even still, this is enjoyable and the production is gorgeous.

RATING: 7.5
[3-players] Fun game with similarities to a game of chicken (who's going to put the other in a position to capture a city?). Very enjoyable with the possibility of playing very quick, too (though AP could be a challenge for some). Also, really awesome bits!

RATING: 7
Buen juego.

No importa que se juegue a dos, tres o cuatro, este juego lo aguanta todo. La verdad es que me sigue impresionando como con 4 números y un par de fichas más Knizia pudo crear un juego tan duro.

Si los jugadores son del mismo nivel, las partidas son apretadísimas y muy tensas, ademas es muy rejugable.

Personalmente como más me gusta es a 3, pero a 2 es buenísimo también. Para 4 está muy bien, y el juego conserva todo su espíritu, pero creo que es un poco más difícil llevar el control de la partida.

(Dec. 2010) Tras un monton de partidas empiezo a pensar como otros jugadores: es una especie de 3-en-raya. Es un buen juego, pero NO un gran juego.

Good game.

It doesn't matter you play it with 2, 3 or 4 people, this game holds everything. I'm really impressed by how Knizia could create a game like this only using 4 numbers and a few tiles.

If players are both similar ranked, games are very competitive and it's very replayable.

I prefer to play it in a 3 player version, but for two people it's also very good. For 4 people the game goes on perfectly, but it's a little bit more difficult to have the control of the game I guess.

(Dec. 2010) After a lot of plays I'm thinking like other players: it's a kind of Tic-Tac-Toe. It is a good game but NOT a great game.

Yet another interesting abstract by Knizia. The random order of tile draws simply decides whether you will go for an immediate benefit, or set yourself up for later opportunities. A number of tiles with their special effects adds another level of control over the board.

RATING: 7.5
A tense, tile laying game.  Much of the game's outcome can be determined by each players initial selection of five tiles at the beginning of the game.  Chose wisely.  Three players is definitely the sweet spot for this game.  I am not sure, but I sense there may be a first player advantage in the two-player game.  In a four player game, there is a chance of (accidental) king making, especially if one of the players is not at the same skill level as the other players.  At three players, this game really shines.  This game is both one of my favorite tile-laying games and one of my favorite Knizia games.

Samurai is a game of majorities. In a 4-player game, 39 majority battles to get one of the tokens placed randomly on the board at start are fought simultaneously. Each of these tokens belongs to one of three factions, with the ultimate goal for the players to achieve a majority in one of the three factions. Only players with a majority are considered for the win unless no player was able to gain a majority. To earn such a token, players place tiles on the board influencing either a specific faction or all of them but then to a lesser degree. A few special tiles allowing to swap tokens, re-use tiles or placing more than one tile at once spice up the game.

Samurai is an old-fashioned Euro, one of the classic Knizia’s. It’s confrontational in a way that’s unusual for modern Euros. It has a strong right-player binding. Unthoughtful moves by the previous player leave chances for the following player and can easily decide the game. Due to only three different factions, Samurai is probably best at that count. With four players, two players likely will have a harder time than the others, battling it out for the majority of the same type. A good game but potentially only great with experienced players of similar skill at the right player count. Under these conditions, a whole new subtle game of incentivizing other players to do mutually beneficial moves could arise.

I finally found someone to play this with last night, and I'm in love (with the game, not with Sergei).  First of all, this game is beautiful to look at it.  Which is a good thing, because we were both staring intently at the board in complete silence, analyzing the possibilities.

I just love how Knizia subtly evokes a historical setting with a tight, minimalist ruleset.  It somehow felt Japanese -- you patiently build up strong positions, then suddenly strike at your opponent (or are stricken).

This is just my initial assessment after two plays, but as I said, I am in love.

Very impressive game system.  I thought that I was competent, but have been beaten soundly by more experienced players.  I think a good memory helps, but mainly one needs to pay very close attention to the opponents' actions.  The game is very much about timing and making most of each move.  The scoring system is really very simple, but can seem convoluted when trying to explain it to new players.  The theme is non-existent, but the wonderful components go a long way.  The speed of the game is really nice - like Through the Desert or Mykerinos, it really feels like you've played a nice, involved game in only 30 - 45 minutes.

Eeek overhyped game. I enjoyed my first game of this but expected so much more. Reiner Knizia is certainly worshipped alot here and I have yet to experience the brunt of his games but so far I'm not blown out of the water. This is not to say I can't see this game growing on me. There is a learning curve with this game be it only one game long for the most part. There are quirks of the map that should be considered closely before playing it initially. The scoring of this game is, apparently, typically Knizia. I didn't find it very thrilling, possibly a little too simple for my tastes.Interesting game and I'm looking forward to it growing on me, however, I won't be asking for it.

Seems rather chaotic compared to Tigris & Euphrates. You need to commit strong pieces to secure majorities, but any of your investments can be nullified by other players using special pieces to hose you. The scoring system makes sense, but is fairly unintuitive. Probably feels less light with only two players. It fell completely flat with three, but I still don't want to believe it's a bad game, and the computer version is OK.

Update: After playing it with four face to face I still think 6 is as high as it goes. It's a very nice design, but it invites overanalysis, rewards tracking hidden information, and cannot survive reckless play by any one player.

The rules are so elegant for this game I sometimes use it as a small step beyond a gateway game for players that are looking for more tactical decisions in games. You have one action on your turn, place a tile on the map. From that simple action you get a game that is surprisingly deep.

Gran juego de mayorias. El tema aunque pegado es atrayente y el nivel de los componentes bastate bueno (excepto los biombos para tapar tus fichas). Su tablero modular hace que sea igual de bueno para 2, 3 o 4 jugadores. Sus reglas son sencillas y suele gustar mucho a los no jugones.

juego abstracto donde vas a estar pensando la mejor manera de puntuar y tapando a los adversarios a la vez que intentas quitarle puntos.

La manera de puntuar al final no te permite relajarte en ningún aspecto, debiendo luchar siempre para no quedarte fuera de la partida.

RATING: 8.5
A lot of "Take that" confrontation, without the need to get upset because there are some many other opportunities on the board. 4-player feels a little chaotic to me must because the board is so long and I couldn't focus on the other side and a lot can happen on the other 3 players turns that you can't take advantage of.Typical Knizia scoring system of attaining multiple types of sets (Religion, Military, Economy), but forcing you not to focus on one.  This is my favorite implementation because you compare who has majorities (if you don't have a majority on any of the 3 sets, you are automatically out of the winner's circle) and then compare minorities for the winner.You can choose any five of your tiles to start, but from there drawing is random.

Pros: Tactical Tile Laying, beautiful components, 3 piece board that adjusts to 2-4 players, Plays fast
Cons: Random tile draw leaves you shafted at times, Pasted-on (albeit aesthetically pleasing) theme

Hans im Glück edition. Fantastic graphic design & pieces.

Final verdict on gameplay is yet to come, but looks good -- seems short but still w/lots of depth. Glad I finally got it!

UPDATE: IMHO the game suffers some if not played by people w/some previous experience of it -- we have always used random starting locations/ & tiles in that case, which takes away some of the strategy. Rating ~5-6 if so.

If played with elaborate placement & at-start tile selection I give it a rating of 7.

Samurai is a great balance between deep strategy and luck.  Having a hand of tiles to manage mitigated the randomness of the draw, but still limits choices enough to prevent much analysis paralysis.  Playing well still requires a grand strategy on what to pursue, but you need to play well tactically as well to execute your plan and to prevent setting other players up.  It's fast, tight, and entertaining - one of Knizia's best!

Strategically hard game.  Not the type of game you can master as there is always so much to do and so little time, but lots of fun and components are great! What a great game, almost impossible to win over and over again, because its hard to master and cover everything in the game.
But, perhaps that's its flaw on the fun side?

Combination of tile placement and set collection with very nice material. Each player has the same set of tiles. The tiles are placed to surround cities and gain majorities in one of the three sets (high hats, buddha's or rice fields). I know that the key to this game is waiting for the right moment to place tiles, but I simply don't seem to get into this one. Least liked of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.

I first rated this an 8, but after having played a number of times more with my little sister, I really enjoy this odd little Knizia number. Many complain of the weird scoring, but I think it makes sense after a couple of plays at the very most. An elegant two-player game turns into a rather more chaotic three- or four-player game, but it keeps a nice sense of tension throughout.

UPDATE: I hear there is a remake with cards, that does not feature the little plastic Buddhas, rice paddies, and high helmets.  The game would be pointless.  Buy this one. It costs more, but is gorgeous, and the art and bits REALLY add to the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm really sorry I don't have more to say about it now . If I have to name an elegant design this one comes to mind. Only scoring in a  real majority (no tie) can win you the game. Very clever and fun to play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
One of Knizia's best works. I must confess that I had been wrong about the game end condition. The game ends "when all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The game is rather light but very engaging. It plays smoothly. Once learned it's super easy to play. The quality of components is great, the game is stylish and beautiful. 
The only problem is it's description. It's not a war game or historical game- it's simply a logic game with some japanese theme in the artwork - it could be just numbers and colours instead and the map could be replaced by squared or hexed paper. Explaining the core of the game takes about 15 seconds. So don't expect anything epic. 
It takes from half to one hour but requires lots of concentration and thinking, so with good opponents that is enough. 
It reminds me of Neuroshima Hex pretty much but I like it better- especially for 3 or 4 players. It's much more accessible and universal theme-wise and again, it looks gorgeous

RATING: 8
This is THE game for me. This was made for me. I absolutely love it's simplicity and elegance. Knowing what pieces your opponent still has, what his possibilities are. Being able to calculate his moves. Well balanced. Great with 2 or 3, still good with 4.

I actually like the game better than you may suppose based on my rating. It's a terrific puzzle game with a domino effect that plays out magnificently. The rating should be an 8 but I have a pet peeve with games that pretend to be a theme but are truly abstract puzzle games. Do not buy this game thinking you're going to be getting a game about Samurai or Japan. The mechanics would have worked just as well with colored blocks and shapes. Slapping a theme onto a mechanic makes me feel as though someone in the marketing department had too much to say. Okay, my beef aside, this is one of the few abstract/puzzle games I recommend and feel most gamers should have in their collection.

What a great area control game that can be played by 4 in less than an hour.  Always remember to secure control of at least one token type, or you won't even have a chance for the win.  Quick play tiles, water tiles, wild samurai tiles, and even tiles that allow you to switch tokens......Knizia at his best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Samurai looks brilliant: the gameboard is beautiful (althought it is a little thin) and gamepieces, those little buddhas, ricefields and high-helmets, are awesome. The Japan-theme is there, you can almost feel it. 

The game mechanic is simple (tile-laying) but it offers a lot of tough decisions. As usual, Knizia has made very interesting scoring system: because every player keeps their scores hidden (and 'who is the winner' -system is quite complicated) the excitement lasts all the way to the end.

This is definitely a classic!

[2008.Feb.19] A classic Reiner Knizia tile laying game. Like its brethren games (e.g., [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/503]Through the Desert[/url][/i]), in [i]Samurai[/i] players are almost always tormented—in a good way, mind you—by not being able to play 'just one more' tile. Skillfully managing your available tiles and striking when you have the opportunity is what this game is all about. Will you be the next Emperor of Japan?

I don't like the fact that you can lay tile anywhere. I would prefer that you start somewhere and can only place tile adjacent to you kindgom. This would have create some sort of look and feel that you are actually expanding your territory. The scoring mechanics is also bad. We end up all losing except the owner of the game because all players tried to get a balanced amount of of each token types. What I found stupid is that there are multiple scoring phase in cases of ties but not for regular scoring. Instead, they should have given points for each of these phase instead to reward different combinations of tokens.

Too much addition and too boring and mathish.  My husband likes it much more than me.  I don't see the big attraction.  It's okay.  I hate having to add up the numbers every time I want to make a move and then forget them and add them again.

Good tile placement game of capture and balanced priorities.  Might be the best-looking game I've seen, too.  I like the idea that everyone gets the same tiles, but they will get them in a different order.

I think this is a great game to introduce non-gamers to Euro games. It has a unique, scalable game board, great glass bits to wow them, and rules that can be grasped quickly (except maybe the end-scoring; make sure to explain that adequately).

RATING: 8
I had been craving [thing=3][/thing] for some time and was happy to receive it in a trade.  The mechanics and theme just felt very clean and elegant to me, and the components looked great.  I had played the computer version previously and I was particularly hopeful that this would be a good two player game for us, as we've enjoyed other abstract Knizia titles like [thing=50][/thing], [thing=760][/thing], and [thing=9446][/thing]---games where you fight for a target by laying down cards of specific values.  [thing=3][/thing] adds a spatial component as well as interesting scoring system to the mix.  

Unfortunately, this is one of the games where our tastes diverge coompletely---she couldn't really stand it.  I was a little surprised since it felt somewhat similar to the cardgames listed above.  Mostly, she really doesn't like spatial games like this.  Despite the nice components, the gameplay feels very dry and abstract.  Plus, especialy for two, the zero-sum gameplay feels very relentless and cutthroat and, in some cases, mean.  For example, using the special token to switch out a token to mess up her carefully laid plans felt more than a little mean to her.

Sadly, this probably won't be getting that much playtime, although I do feel like this would be a very good two player game for the right set of people.

RATING: 9
Based on two-player games.  Once you have opened the box (do not get me started on the cover which looks like a poster for a terrible am-dram version of a Gilbert & Sullivan opera - a more stylised artwork I feel would be more suitable) it is wonderful.  The pieces celebrate the aesthetic traditions of Japan (specifically their lacquerware), the rulebook is clear and comprehensive, the game is highly accessible*, and the game allows a level of strategy and tactics which is not exclusive to the experienced gamer.  Samurai plays quickly, though with each turn there are several choices to weigh-up, and certainly leaves you wanting to play more.

Though at its heart Samurai is an abstract game the attention to detail enthuses the game with theme and atmosphere which is often lacking in some games who have grand thematic pretensions.  In 2007 the British Museum hosted an exhibition entitled Crafting Beauty in Modern Japan and I feel that Samurai would sit comfortably among the exhibits (if you remove the cover).  Knizia is undoubtably a 'national living treasure.'

*Gameplay is colour dependent therefore players who suffer from levels of colour blindness will find difficulty playing the game

A very sophisticated version of the Dot game.  The mechanics are interesting in concept, but create a dry game to actually play.  Scoring isn't confusing, as some say it is, but it is needlessly complicated.  Tigris & Euphrates had simple, straightforward scoring that Samurai could have taken a lesson from.

*UPDATED 10/21/05* I still think that this is a very good game, but it seems less fun with each subsequent play.  This will never see the light of day with my game group, and frankly, when I'm in the mood for a two-player abstract, I'd rather play Go every time.  TRADED 1/06

RATING: 8
This is a fine game.  Firstly, the presentation (however fake the characters) is well done and the tactile feel of the pieces has much to recommend it, even if the game does not really reflect any connection to the theme other than the shape of the islands).  Then game itself is a pleasing mix of tactics and strategy - you need an overall approach but you have to react to the evolving board.  There is some luck in the draw of the tiles (reduced if you pick your opening 5 tiles) and the end of the game can sneak up on you - more than once neither player has realized the last token of one type is gone.  Determining the winner can feel a bit odd too, with a list of conditions and results, but overall it is a winner.

RATING: 7
A classic Reiner Knizia game where you are placing tiles to surround cities and towns.  Once completely surrounded, players with most Buddhas, Rice or Noble Hats, collect the tokens.  You are trying to get the most types of goods in each category.  Players compare the lowest number of items collected and determine who is lowest and that player is eliminated.  You continue to compare types of goods and determine whoever has the most wins.  Very simple to play but with many subtleties which make the game interesting.

I love the black plexiglass pieces that come with this game. They feel great to play with, and look really cool on the game board.

There is a thin veil of theme here providing some context for what is essentially an abstract game. I wouldn't call the theme pasted-on; Knizia has very clearly developed the game with a Japanese theme in mind, it's just as a game it feels more like I'm placing tiles than conquering feudal Japan.

However, this is a very elegant game with some tough decisions and deep strategy, and a reasonable play time. I think it's a keeper.

First impression after one 2p game and one 4p game.  I enjoyed this a lot more with 4p.  It starts slow, but builds in interest through the middle and end part of the game.  At the beginning of the match I was ready to put this in the forgotten pile of one time experiences, and by the end of the match I wanted to play it again right away.  Simple rules, short without being a filler, deep strategies, interesting board.  JATE (Just another themeless Euro) -- the theme is window dressing, this is an abstract game using numbers.  Having said that, the  FFG edition looks charming and is very enjoyable to see.  Maybe it's the area control aspect, maybe the fluid board, maybe the limited information and light touch of luck, but I rank this higher than I usually rank abstract games with no theme; Bravo Dr. Knizia.

I find it hard to explain why I don't like Samurai. It's well designed, but it just rubs me the wrong way I guess. It gives me a feeling of frustration: you can only react to one problem at a time, and when it's your turn again your opponents have created two new ones.
Not being able to do everything is normal (and good) in a game, but here it just happens in a frustrating way.

This game is definitely deeper than what it appears on the surface. Very simple rules, but I don't like the scoring system, more complex than the game itself.

It may not appeal to everyone as the game has a pasted theme, in fact no theme at all. You place numbered tiles and other special tiles to win figures period. But don't worry no theme does not make it bad. If you look at this game as an abstract strategy game, then very good value for your time. Short not too long and a very good filler.

I really like this one.  It's interesting to consider all of your choices.  You really have to try and keep track of your opponents' captures even though they are hidden.  "Card Counters" can take it further and consider the possible tiles your opponents have left to play (certainly not me though.)

I am also impressed that you can scale this game to be a bit more deep and thinky by having the players place the pieces on the map and choose their initial hand of tiles.  I personally prefer to just randomize it and make it a bit lighter and have just a tad more luck in it.

I love this game. It's easy to teach and people quickly catch on to all the strategies available to you on a given turn. There is a little bit of randomness to the game as you have to draw your replacement tiles but I think this really forces you to adapt your initial strategy to work with what your new tiles are each turn. 

Explaining the scoring to new people is a bit of a chore as it's so unusual, but after the first game, most people have it down. Don't get to play it enough.

Genius! My gaming heaven! This is my favourite game, no doubt. And I believe this game is the definition of elegance. Simple rules, very fluid gameplay. But my brain always hurts when I play Samurai!

Samurai has a perfect game/time ratio. You don´t waste your time with paperwork. You simply play. You are thinking all the time.  

The game scales so well. It´s excellent with 2, 3 or 4 players. 

On top of all this, you will find a very clever scoring system, based on majorities. This is the best part. You don´t play to collect the most pieces. You play to have 2 majorities. Brilliant!

Some may say it´s a very mathy game. Yes, it is. But it´s a matter of taste. And some may say the game ties too much. Well, I think it´s an important part of the game, you need to know the tie breakers to optimize your moves, but I don´t see it as a failure of the game.

I really don't care for the weird scoring (thematic or not). Competition feels so tight, I always feel quite tense playing this game. There's no question that it's very attractive, though. I love how the map really is of the Japanese islands.

Update: I've now started to play this with my family, where it gets to be a shorter, attractive game. I still am a little bugged by the wonky scoring, though.

1 play on Mabiweb.  Sadly, I have to rate this pretty low as it is just not that much fun.  All players start the game with the same tiles, so scores will always been razor thin close.  You would think this would make for an exciting game, but it feels more like a coin flip.  I find Kreta, a similar type game on Mabiweb, a more varied and interesting experience.  Samurai is take it or leave it for me.

Another solid game from Reiner Knizia.  An easy game to play but after eight games we felt that we'd explored it and there wasn't enough depth for us to want to play much more.  All games seem to come down to one or two points with no player able to develop any strong strategies so it felt like it was down to luck who won. A good filler but not a game I'd choose to play when there are better games around.  Good gateway game.

RATING: 9
This may turn out to be my favorite Knizia. It's absolutely brilliant.

I thought the theme was pasted on, but it isn't. A few turns in, I started feeling like I was watching feudal Japanese politics play out -- and this being a Knizia game, the beautiful math and efficiency underlying everything made it incredibly tense. Waaay more tense than I expected.

In my first game, I felt like I was floundering early on, then saw that I had a chance to pivot midgame, and then closed out by realizing just how much I'd shot myself in the foot with my early plays. One particularly boneheaded play could have dramatically improved my final position, though not far enough to win. Every move is important, and everything speeds up as the board starts to fill up -- and suddenly it becomes difficult to play without also improving someone else's lot.

The dash of chance (tile draws) is just right. I love that everyone chooses their opening hand, and then seeds the board based on their (nascent, secret) agenda; I love it just as much how much of the game thereafter feels like it's played on shifting sands.

I can see a ton of depth lurking under the surface, too -- and a metagame that would develop based on repeated plays with the same folks. There's an entire of stuff to think about underlying what is, on its surface, a fairly simple game.

I adore turn angst, and the dial on this one goes to 11. It's an incredible game.

RATING: 6
Rating based on 4 players.

Easy-to-explain, difficult to do well in (for me, anyway!). It's a nice blend between strategic and tactical thinking, as you're always limited to what's in your hand, but you have an idea of what actions you have left. A really good game I can see myself liking more with repeated plays as I learn how to play better.

-----------------------------------------------

Traded. The star has fallen on this one for me. It's a good game, but it's missing something that makes it enjoyable for me... hard to say why; maybe there's too many numbers, and it just feels a bit overwhelming even though the game itself is simple to play. Maybe it's also partly that the emphasis is of capitalizing on other people's mistakes rather than making plans of your own (ie, the interaction is mostly confined to blocking, rather than back-and-forth reactions).

After one play (first edition):

I got beat big time in my first game.  Took me a while to get the hang of the tile placement and  area influence.  Didn't help that I drew all my high tiles first, and had no fillers that I could happily burn to close off zones.  And my Ronin was the last tile to show up - lazy Ronin. 

My competitive spirit demanded a rematch, alas it was time to call it a night.  Would love to play again - I can see a good game here which is very teachable.

Might rate it higher with further plays.

After 3 plays:

Played the second edition, which is easier for colour vision.  A great game.  Self balancing based on where the statues are placed. Really enjoyed the competition, and need to piggy back off the tile placement of others in order to secure statues.

The important thing to remember with this game is to ensure you win at least one majority.  If you fail to do that you don't have a chance to win (unless nobody has a majority in any faction).

My last game I tied first in two sets (high hats and rice paddies).  Another player tied me in rice paddies but had more buddhas than everyone else and won.  I felt like I had played a better game than my opponents, but I knew the rules so the loss is acceptable.

For some people this leaves a bad taste.  I think the game is astounding especially 3 players.

02/22/04 Played twice the same day, the second time under duress. That just made my opinion go from mild dislike to very strong dislike. I am absolutely no good at seeing ahead in this game. It seemed every move I made just helped someone else. And all my moves got nullified. I never did understand the scoring system. I'm not saying its a bad game, just that I am and never will be any good at it, hence my low rating.

It's primary merit, that it is the most improbable chick magnet I've ever seen. I've yet to see a woman who could resist it, and they actually willing to play it. It has to be the bits.

Apart from this amazing feature it's an elegant game, where the first few times you sit there wisely staring at the board, pretending you have a well crafted, cunning strategy, but you really just take bits randomly. After that phase the game starts to make sense, and grows on you; it's worth to give it more chance if you find it too random at first.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun and tense game where you are doing your best to win multiple "battles" (majorities) across a map - in Knizian fashion the scoring is the name of the game, you need a majority in one of the three types, but beyond that you need the most of the ones that aren't your majority. Your tiles are drawn at random and you always have a hand of five, however - as the game draws further you can predict your and your opponents draws rather well which means that it doesn't feel "lucky", they simply force you to react differently and plan differently (in terms of managing your tempo and how you spread out).

The pace is rapid, much more so than Tigris & Euphrates, though this game is no less "thinky" per se. You must consider the spatial aspect, but also your influence "count" everywhere - knowing when and where you can lose is just as important as knowing where to push for victory!

I really want to try this more, and while it might not reach the heights of Tigris for me it won't be more than a step behind - also, they don't compete that much as this one does 2-player better than Tigris in my opinion.

A great game!

RATING: 8
Played as 2, 3 and 4-player with excellent  scaling.  Great fun here.  You're not going to be able to do long-range planning as each turn changes things dramatically.  Very easy for beginners to pick up and play.  Curiously, this is one of the more "quiet" games we've played.  More concentration?  More possible moves to consider?  Still a fun one unless you have really slow players.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: A light tile-laying, majority game where players try to secure the right amount of three different kinds of figures.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: It has that perfect blend I love of personal hand (tile) management intersecting with reacting to the current situation of the game as decided by your opponents. Especially nicely done here is that everyone should have all the same tiles available to them at one point or another.

Cons: It's probably a little too dry (or abstract) to excite casual gamers. The conflict is really only coincidental (basically forced by the game), non-aggressive, and probably predictable over time. I think that diminishes the tension of the player interaction to some extent. Scoring was a little confusing. Four player games while recommended, can be a little crowded.

Other: The game's play time is equally ratio-ed to the number of players playing. Probably 5-10 minutes per player depended on how analytical they tend to be. 

Best Use: A lower conflict, easy to learn tile laying game for people who don't need to be convinced games are fun.

I'm not a huge fan of abstracts (and let's face it, it's basically a thinly-themed abstract) but I enjoy this game. I think of it as a Go-ultra-light.

I don't mind a bit of so-called 'chaos' in my games so I don't mind the game with three, or even four players, but two is good as well.

The game might be thinly themed, but the great bits and artwork really suit the game. The Klear PC version is also quite good.

Interesting game with a strong "chess" feel to it. Decent mix of strategy and tactics, although gets very chaotic with 4 players (somewhat chaotic with 3). Repetitive after 10+ plays.

RATING: 6.5
Great design but sometimes hurts the brain a bit.  There are countless options but it's really a game of patience (says the amateur).  You don't want to setup your opponents and it's often hard to set yourself up when you'll need to wait 2 or 3 moves before it's your turn again.  Sometimes there's a juicy score waiting to be plucked but you might be playing a tile you'll wish you had later.  A classic.  UPDATE: after a few more plays I'm a bit put off by just how frustratingly tactical the game is.  The thought required for the game isn't worth the payoff.  UPDATE: raised half a point as I finally won one and am starting to see a subtle game.

I cannot believe I haven't played this more. I've loved this game every time I've played it. It works great with 2, 3, or 4 with the funky board, and it looks great -- which doesn't actually factor into my rating, but true nonetheless. I was asked what my 'sweet spot' is for games, and (for more than two players, anyway) it's this. So despite not a large number of plays, I'm bumping it to 10.

Samurai is my gateway eurogame way back in 1998.  A good tile laying game where it is important to seize the initiative at the most opportune time(s).

Play can be quite tense and tactical but not without the possibility of longer term strategic plays.  Beautiful, polished, pexiglass pieces in the Rio Grande Games edition.

Absolutely wonderful.  Careful placement of tiles is mandatory, but since players' tile stashes differ, this game allows for bluffing, bait and switch strategies, etc.  Also, the elegant scoring makes winning much more difficult than it first appears to be.

Nice abstract. The map is too big to fight everywhere at once, and with that size you can't spend all your resources in a single spot. You need your opponents to help you surround the objectives but you want to swoop in and win them at the last minute. Very nice play with great looking pieces.

RATING: 7
Played once.  An area-influence game where one attempts to collect pieces (towers, buddhas, or cubes) by placing influcence markers.  The scoring is unique, in that to win the game you _must_ have a clear majority of at least one type of piece, but then your points are equal to the number of the total number of _other_ types of pieces that you have.  Very cool. 

I _love_ the thoughtfulness of this game; the game requires a tremendous amount of tactical thinking before placing each tile, especially as the game progresses and the board is filled with a mishmash of tiles.  Since you know exactly how many influence tiles each player has, it quickly becomes possible to consider everyone's possible move, and thus determine which of yours is ideal.  One must chew over each tile placement, and the flavor builds with time.  

The major problem with the game (and the reason it doesn't have an 8, 9, or 10 ranking from me) is that the number of pieces each player has collected of each type is hidden from the other players.  Given that this information is critical to victory in the game, this means that to play well you _must_ memorize the number of pieces each player has collected (since collecting too many of any one type of piece would hurt your score).  Yet memorizing the pieces everyone has collected is tedious and annoying, and detracts from the fun of the game.  Playing with the pieces open removes nothing from the game, yet gives the skilled tactician everything they need to know to make the best moves, without giving an unfair advantage to those who are willing to memorize information.

RATING: 7
In Samurai, players use a stylized map of Japan as the game board. The goal is to collect an assortment of different pieces (buddahs, high hats and rice fields). The game board is well made and conceived. Likewise the pieces are nicely done (probably the best part of this game).  Players take turns and place tokens (tiles) on the board to surround these pieces and capture them. As typical with Reiner Znizia%u2019s games, the game mechanic is simple and easy to grasp but there is lots of strategy involved in placing tokens. Also typical of Znizia, the game is somewhat abstract and the most complicated aspect is scoring at the end of the game. Player interactions come in the form of out maneuvering other players in placing and capturing the pieces you need.

I did enjoy Samurai and liked its simple and Go like game play of placement and control. I recommend it if you%u2019re looking for something slightly less abstract than Go or wanting to play a Go game with more than two.

Elsőre nem fogott meg, amiben nagy szerepe volt, hogy ketten próbáltuk ki. Játszhatónak játszható úgy is, de elég lapos.

Másodszorra már hárman ültünk neki és klasszisokkal nagyobb játékélményt adott. Végig izgalmas, feszült, taktikázós játék volt, nem is nagyon tudtuk abbahagyni (három játék ment le egymás után).

Jó játék, tipikus '90-es évekbeli Knizia: kevés, egyszerű szabály (5 perc alatt betanítható), absztrakcióra valami laza téma ráhúzva, de a játék az óriási kombinációs lehetőségek miatt nagyon élvezetes. Ez is. Klasszikus.

Check out the play-by-web version over at www.mabiweb.com

Nice game which plays quickly and offers up a fair amount of depth.  Because the game employs a strange scoring system, players must manage not only their tiles,  but also their figure intake (figures are used to determine the winner).  The game is for 2-4 players, and I feel it works well with any of those numbers.

One of Knizia's great ones, ingeniously scaled for two, three, or four players. A game of careful calculation, and waiting, a thinker's delight: during the games I've played the atmosphere at the table has been very quiet, suitably Japanese, but tense rather than serene. Beautiful playing pieces and board, interesting scoring system. [22 plays]

AT LEAST 2

I enjoy this game IMMENSELY. It's like a kinder, gentler chess with an infinitely more beautiful board. The game play is simple and elegant and fast and crunchy. I do think I can only play this 2 player with the proper person (SS and NEVER my husband) because the "take that" element would normally kill the carebear in me. Also, there's math and colors involved which sorta made my brain fuzzy and caused a slight bit of AP in me - I kept looking at the board and trying to add numbers, all the while mistaking SS's color for mine. Still, we both enjoyed it and we probably shoulda played this after Jamaica instead of before so my experience with the later wasn't tainted. (see Jamaica notes)

I have the computer game of this on Mac OS X only but keen to get the board game now that I have played it.

This is so simple a concept but so clever in its gameplay.  I imagine a multiplayer game must be quite difficult and a 2 player to be great fun.  I have played the computer on this and also played my girlfriend and I love this game.

I definitely appreciate Samurai's design. As usual with any quality Knizia game, the rules are simple, but the decisions are interesting. Despite the straightforward rules, it took me a while to "get" the game, about a dozen plays to pull off a couple wins in a row. As expected, the complexity is between Tigris & Euphrates and Through the Desert, but the game surprisingly takes about the same amount of time as the latter, maybe 15 to 20 minutes per player.

Unfortunately, apart from its superior components, Samurai doesn't seem to have any advantages over its counterparts for face-to-face play. It lacks the drama or depth of Tigris & Euphrates but isn't as accessible as Through the Desert. (See charlesf's and chally's comments for some astute observations in this vein.) On the iPad, however, where Through the Desert is thoroughly played out and Tigris & Euphrates totally lacks the compressed epic feel it has face-to-face, Samurai is a nice diversion.

An okay abstract.  The black pieces are pretty, while the board is fuggly.  The gameplay is interesting, and requires some bluffing.  I dispise hidden scoring for something you can track.

It's dry, and after a few plays doesn't hold much surprise.

I loved Samurai back in the day, the mechanism is superb and I dug the theme and the feel, but it just doesn't get any plays nowadays. There's also something sinister about the game: despite the zen aspect of it, it seems to arouse bad karma in the players. Maybe it's a bit TOO simple, which emphasizes the wit and the abilitity to calculate,  thus reducing the game to bare essentials: abstract placement of hexes in order to win. The scoring system is legendary & rightly so.

Considering the map(board) is the same every game, its truly amazing how much strategy goes into placing the 3 different pieces on the game board.  This is my first Knizia game and it won't be the last.  The fact that you can tie in 1 catagory and end up losing is just insane.

RATING: 7.5
Samurai is a very nice looking game with nice bits and I like the expandable game board which optimizes the board space based on the number of players. The game is very easy to teach, plays quickly and has a balanced scoring system which some say is a bit quirky but it works well in my opinion. 

For some reason this game has not reached the table a often as it should so it's rating is probably a bit low... but I rate games that I want to play higher and Samurai at this point doesn't quite have the repeat draw that some other games have. This could change as we eventually get this game on the table more often but for now a 7 rating is about right.

Update:
Revised rating slightly upwards to a 7.5 after a few more plays.

Medieval Japan is at your feet. Your task is to acquire the support of the three factions in the country - military, priests and peasants - and you do it by placing your forces around the cities and villages. When surrounded, the faction joins the strongest force of their kind. That's about it!

What then is so great about Samurai? 

Firstly it is the simplicity. The game is quickly learnt and quickly played. 

Secondly it is the elegance. The pieces are exquisite and the map size changes with the number of players.

Thirdly it is the surprising depth. Your forces differ slightly (the strength rangens from 1 to 4 and some "wild" cards impact all three factions) and you need to place them carefully to optimize their total influence. 

Fourthly it is the fierce struggle hidden beneath the calm surface. Every tile placed is a fight for influence and you must always take into account your opponents' responses in order not to be beaten by the final tile surrounding a city or village.

Samurai does indeed stand a comparison with the classic go but with more players. Granted, this is not a game for everybody but if you do enjoy a chaotic brain-burner, there are few better games than this.

A really strong tile-laying game. It's ideal for 3 players looking for a quick and tactical experience. An old classic designed by the famous Reiner Knizia.

My only complaint is that the scoring system is weirdly complicated. The rest of the rules are very simple so when I start to explain how you win the game, people always begin to raise their eyebrows.

Autant j'aime vraiment ce jeu, autant j'y connais du succès. Bien que je n'ais pas compilé les pointages finaux, je crois avoir gagné mes 6 premières parties...

J'ai le préjugé favorable provenant de Tigris & Euphrates. Samurai est toutefois assez différent pour y trouver son compte même si T&E nous déplaît. 

Jeu abstrait, de positionnement de tuiles, d'encerclement, où il est très important d'observer quelles tuiles adverses ont déjà été jouées, de prédire la main des adversaires, et de positionner nos tuiles de façon optimale en tenant compte des besoins qu'auront nos adversaires pour eux-mêmes avancer dans leurs quêtes de statuettes!...

Note: Je n'ai joué qu'en utilisant la variante "main de départ tirée au hasard" et je n'ai pas vraiment envie d'opter pour celle où chaque joueur choisit sa main de départ de cinq tuiles...

The end-game scoring system was enough for me to ask "Why did I just play this?"

A very typical Knizia game - clean rules, a bit of luck, seemingly deep strategies. Feels classic and elegant without much chrome, which is a good thing to some people. 

While I like playing this, Admittedly the game is AP-prone - but most importantly, a move that is made after deep thoughts might be as good (or bad) as a less thought-out move, as it's highly dependent on if your opponent (even more than 1) wants to attack you.

Japan-themed (the board literally represents the various islands), nice components.

Tile laying game where you're trying to enclose towns with different influence markers. Ideally, place your tiles so they count for more than 1 town. 

Nice little brain burner, plays in 30' with 2. Doesn't try to be too much, succeeds elegantly in offering up a pleasant "trying to outguess your opponent" game.

Perhaps a bit pricy though.

Knizia's game set in ancient Japan where you play tokens to surround a city to claim rice paddies, buddhas or tall hats. Scoring is unique in that to qualify to win, you need to have the most in any of one of the three items, then you need to have more remaining items. Okay, but I prefer some of Knizia's other games, this one seems like a lot of work to try and have fun with.

Seems like an interesting little game; I've only played once. It is a little abstract for my tastes, but the puzzle aspect and quick playing time kept me curious to play again. I found the fact that you get your tiles randomly a bit disconcerting, but I can see that full tile availability cause static strategies to form. It felt a bit strange to be waiting for that one whammy piece to come out so you could grab that place you had your eye on...

Update: Played some more of this two player (which plays very well), and I'm enjoying it more and more. It's a much more 'aggressive' game than I first thought, in the sense that it's as much about denying other players points as much as gaining them for yourself.

Abstract tile-laying game does not constitute my Knizia penchant of choice. I don't mind abstracts but the theme is so paper thin that it's actually starting to bother me. Add a wee too much randomness in the tile draw and you have a decent game but nothing more... However, as a two player game it's pretty entertaining (as there is not an abundance of choice). Update: rating has gone up half-a-notch, has grown on me over the years (typical for abstracts)

An area control game, it working in the theme to a decent degree, especially in the board layout. 

The ability to swap tiles or figures out from under your opponents adds a nice twist, as well as being able to, on occasion, place 2 or more tiles when the opponent thinks they have a city wrapped up brings a subtle aggressive flavor.

Great game.  I should play it more than I do.  Very minimal luck involved.  Yes, luck is involved in that you draw tiles but ultimately you know every piece that can be drawn and can plan ahead accordingly knowing that you will eventually get the piece you are looking for.  That does require you to be flexible but you are certainly still in control for the most part.

Area control through tile placement.  The few tweaks in this game improve strategy, and enhance oppurtunistic play.  I also like the sooring mechansim which forced players to play in a more balanced way.  I think this is probably better with more players, although I've only played it with the max number.  This is one I'd play again.  The only down side is the potential for long pauses between turns.

I love Samurai. I think there's a depth of strategy here that nearly rivals something along the lines of chess. Choosing your starting hand and choosing what to play when, not jumping the gun on certain cards, is very strategic. It's easy to learn but takes time to master. Great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
You have to put your tiles next to the point pcs (three different types) so that you have control of the pt pc when it is time for it to be distributed (surrounded by tiles).  In the end of the game you need to have the most of a type for contention of winning, than you count the rest of your pcs and the most wins.

I do enjoy playing this game because there are interesting choices.  It seems to shine very well with three players.

My 14 year old nephew and I sat down to learn this together.  I had gone over the rules several times before and knew that the scoring was complex, but left it alone until we needed it.  It turns out, we did not even need it.  He soundly beat me the first game.  The game was easier to play than the rules were to understand.  The fun thing was, that after showing him several other games over the course of a week, it was his favorite.  I agree.  Fun theme, some strategy, tactics galore, confrontation everywhere.  When I lost, I still felt like I had still won some battles, and with a little better strategy, could have won the war.  We played our first few games by selecting random tiles.  The last game, we picked our tiles up front.  There is a reason why this game has been around so long and remains in the top 100 - it is really good.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I cannot get anyone to play with me...
-> Seriously, I prefer direct confrontation just a wee bit more so I would not want to play this all the time.

Area control with limited resources. You can only influence some parts of the board, so you need to be selective with your units.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simple rules to play tiles but rules to determinate winner makes playing interesting. There is element of luck involved but it is just the right amount. It cannot hurt you too much either as everyone eventually has same supply of tiles. You have just big enough selection of tiles to plan a bit ahead but mainly playing is about right tactical moves. There aren't any dead moments in Samurai. It offers very intense package for the relatively short playing time (easily under an hour with 4 players and less with fewer players). Excellent game. Scales well over whole range of players (2-4). I like the game most with 3 players but only a slightly.

Update (27.9.2006): It is only fair to raise rating from 9 to 10 after 10 plays. Samurai deserves it.

Meccaniche semplici ma strategicamente interessante. Gioco decisamente astratto (è di Knizia), solo grafica e titolo si rifanno al mondo orientale, ma il gioco è talmente carino che ce ne si dimentica. Scala benissimo al variare del numero dei giocatori. In due è un gioco quasi scacchistico, mentre in 3 e 4 c'è il rischio che un giocatore meno abile influenzi in maniera involontaria l'esito della partita. Gioco di piazzamento e, anche se l'interazione è notevole, il calcolo la fa da padrone. Esiste anche una componente 'fortuna' dovuta dalla pesca delle carte ma solitamente non determinante. Per meccaniche di maggioranza mi ricorda altri astratti quali Clans e Terra Nova, ma trovo Samurai superiore anche per l'idea del calcolo finale dei punti vittoria che ricorda giochi come Tigris & Euphrates e Himalaya.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Typically sterile and cultured area control from Knizia. This might just be the best of his tile-laying series, thanks to a two-layered control strategy: a large scale one in the opening setup followed by the nitty-gritty of individual buildings. The oddball scoring makes a midgame switch of strategy both feasible and viable.

[i]I was only able to play a 2p game and I thought it was great, however I read a lot of discussion about the 2p game favoring the first player and was a bit disappointed because I would probably primarily play with 2. However; as I thought about it it wouldn't be bad since I would be playing with my kids and this could give them a small edge when playing against me (although they really don't need it).

- Beautiful components, modular board that adjusts depending on the number of players.
- Another simple to teach, but packed with strategy board game.
- Just enough different types of tiles to really make the game packed with tough decisions and lots of replay potential.[/i]

I can see why it's so highly rated. Classic Knizia-style design, and I mean that in a good way: easy to learn and play, lots of choices to make on each turn, math-centered, with fairly thin theme. On the other hand, the lack of theme leaves it somewhat dry, so although I rate it highly based on its design (with some kudos for the board and bits) I find it's a game I want to play only when I'm in a more contemplative mood. That said, when I'm in the mood, every time I play this game I love it. But add to  a very attractive 4-part board and attractive playing pieces and you have an excellent playing experience in what feels like a classic game. Purchased October 2008.

Do not play without the player screens. The "hidden" pieces of the game is what makes it really fun to play, IMHO. The game plays OK with 2 players, but has a very different flavor. As more players are added to the game, the game board gets bigger and the ship tiles take on an added hidden importance. Your 5 tile selection at the start of the game is very crucial and should be carefully considered. Quality "bits and pieces" too.

RATING: 6
Having your specials and highs come out early-ish and your 2's late, rather than vice versa, is a huge influence on the result when you have just 20 tiles. Combined with the "player to the right set me up" issue, I rarely enjoy the game and certainly don't go looking for it, even though I can appreciate the design and the components.

Beautiful game. I really like the Fantasy Flight Games edition (well done guys!). The artwork is really nice, the plastic pieces (despite preferring the original ones) look very good on the board.

You can tell why this game is praised by so many people. It's a beautifully elegant game play experience. The rules are super simple but once you know what you're doing you also realise the how difficult decisions are to make.

Awesome game.

RATING: 7
Nice, clean strategy.  I play the iOS version constantly, but it is fun live as well.  Nice ratio of playtime to fun factor, and the dash of screw-your-neighbor adds good interaction.

[11.19.14] I enjoy playing Samurai, but none of the folks I play with do.  They don't hate it, but there are so many other games they'd rather play.  And for my limited time, I have to agree.  It was taking up space and never getting played, so I sold it with a tear in my eye.

SOLD, November 2014.

As simple as rules can be, yet so much thought can go into every move. This came may cause some brain drain, yet it is more then welcome. Intense strategy at its best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another Knizia game with simple rules in which the depth is revealed over time.  As in Tigris and Euphrates, a prevalent theme in the underlying strategy of this game is achieving a sense of balance.  The game is quick, especially with 2 players, but every turn matters.

UPDATE:  Ive played the ios version of this quite a bit lately.  I find it is MUCH easier to win when you go first in a 2p game.  If two players are evenly matched, it seems player 1 wins a majority of the time.  I've read in the forums where statistics have validated this claim.  Many strategy games do have a player 1 advantage, but Samurai seems to suffer from it more than many.

UPDATE:  I have recently picked this game back up.  Very addictive game.  The first player advantage is defintely there for skilled players.  But leaving a boat or two out for player 1 seems to even it out.  This game is a classic.

RATING: 6
This game is pretty much an abstract.  Each player is trying to influence and win tokens on various cities, and the more players focusing on a particular city, the more likely it will be scored during the game.  So you probably don't want to be off somewhere doing your own thing, but trying to compete with the other players is difficult.

I love the iOS-version of this. I think I like that digital version better than the real board game.

Quick playing game, not bad at all. The components are of high quality, but the theme is shallow and slighty artificial. It's dry and cold and I think I have almost prefered this one as an a pure abstract.

Moderate fun but good replayability.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
An excellent game with tough choices that scales well from 2 to 4.  The pieces are fantastic and the scoring is ingenious.  Has a very strong left-right relationship problem in such that a weak player could definately ruin the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It was a very good fair strategic game.  It seemed like it was well balanced and a solid game.  My main issue was that it really dragged half-way through the game until the end due to heavy analysis paralysis.  If the AP was lower, I'd rate it higher.

This one is fun, and the glass(?) pieces are really nice. The board is cool and fun to set up, and the play is paced pretty well. Cool victory conditions to boot.

RATING: 8
Was given the game as a gift, and have played it eight times in two days (which is a lot for me).  I think Samurai's incredible.  Extremely simple rules and mechanics coupled with brain burning decision making.  It's tense from beginning to end.  All plays so far have been 2-player.  I'm really looking forward to adding on the extra islands with some friends.  Initial rating: (a strong) 8

3/28/14 - 20 plays, rating still 8 - I was surprised to see 20 logged plays, that is quite a bit higher than average in my collection.  I think it's surprising because I feel like I'm still just scratching the surface when it comes to mastering this deceptively simple to play game.  Samurai is excellent at all player counts.  The games are wonderfully tense, you are torn between reacting to your opponents and pursuing your own agenda. With only two actions per turn, you always feel vulnerable.  Anyone who generalizes euro-games as multi-player-solitaire needs to play some Knizia designs; Samurai being a particularly excellent one.

RATING: 8.5
Great abstract game, although strategy may sometimes be obscure, and with more than 2 players it may be difficult to lay down even good tactics, but it's definitely a masterpiece. Rules are immediate, gameplay is elegant, game is quick and very beautiful looking. It is even very original: despite being a rather old game, nowadays, I don't remember many other games later on with similar mechanics. Watch out: many people here note that the scoring mechanism is very original: it has been actually copied by many other successive games. The mechanics of the game, instead, are still unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very nice abstract game. Excellent components, fast and interesting. And it scales very well from 2 to 4 players. Played with 2, 3 and 4 players and enjoyed it every time! :)

Rating is not higher because the game is as dry as they come. Very cold and Mathy.

RATING: 9
Fantastic game, plays fast, offers plenty of choices, gets more intens towards the end. I don´t mind the curious scoring method, it works fine, as long as you fully understand how to calculate. It´s part of the tension towards the end of the game to speculate how well your play has been compared with the others.

Very elegant strategy game where you must constantly re-evaluate strategy and relative position.  Plays well with 2 or in a larger group.  The most likely tile placement game to hit the table at our house due to its short play time.

A terrific game. It is quickly learned and serves very well as a gateway game. It also plays very quickly, and therefore stands in as a great weeknight game or as an opener for a heavy game night. The art on the box cover is awkward and contrived, but that is my only complaint. Highly recommended.

An interesting basic play, and for a change Knizia seems to balance his over-dependence on mathematical equation with a degree of actual fun.  But why do I feel like there's not much actual game here?  Perhaps it's that, in the end, you're limitted to really only one type of maneuver in this game -- ah well, that's a personal hobgoblin.

Mediocre Area Control number crunching exercise.  Fun with two, dull with more.  Tile laying doesn't feel very compelling.  Whoever sits to the left of the weakest player is most likely to win.  I'd rather play T&E or San Marco to scratch the Area Control itch.

RATING: 6
I consider Samurai as Lite-E&T for several reasons, but especially the pressure of balancing your victory conditions, though in Samurai it is alittle convoluted. Despite being played in half the time and less rules I find more time and effort spent in E&T more enjoyable. For me I think this is due to Samurai's tiles being so numerical and specific, though they do provide a richer narrative. The order they are drawn can hamper your ideal plays, which I can accept, but in E&T there is a sense you can find a solution to unfortunate tile draws.For me this solving is fascinating spatially. I can sympathise that in Samurai there is no immediate reward of a victory point, your mentally executed build up can be frustratingly undermined i.e. by swap tile, with no gain. But the experience that bothers me most is there is an overpowering deduction element to the game in order to play well:what tiles are in your draw pool;what tiles could your opponent have; how many buddha's etc. All this can be replayed by number crunching the board as to who took what and if it wasn't for the swap tiles, hiding the vp's would be redundant. In E&T you often only need to deduce an opponent's lack of a colour.

This is not a bad game to play however...the scoring is so messed up that no one knows where they stand as the game is progressing. In addition to that the board is stagnant - Conquest of the Fallen Lands takes the same concepts found in Samurai and turns it into a real game.

A simple but deep strategy game that plays quickly. The rules are easy to teach, but the complexities of the choices they present are immediately obvious. There's a lot to think about while playing. I like how even setting up the board is part of the strategy of the game, where all the players try to decide which resources they are going to go for and put them in exploitable configurations. The scoring is very interesting too, where you have to consider which resources your opponents are going for and how that affects your ability to get majorities and/or the most non-majority resources. The art and components of the Fantasy Flight version are very well done too.

This is a game that I know from experience (namely Modern Art) is a game that I should like. It's got a complex 'mathy' tile laying mechanic (I don't even know how to describe the nature of it, 'geometric' doesn't seem right at all), and there's the standard Knizia touch of trying to get the most of things while getting as few as possible of what you have the most of. A sort of backwards optimization that reminds me of when I played Ingenious against computers and was savaged. 

I can sorta grasp that there's some value to using your pieces to grab things other people are spending lots of tiles towards, and at the same time trying to keep control of the board. Is this area control in a fancy sort of way? This is one of a few big tile-layers from Knizia, do they all sorta feel this way? I'm looking forward to playing it again, but I'm still not convinced if I like it or not..

While the scoring mechanism is obtuse, I can see the reasoning - you have to win something to be eligible but using the next highest forces you to go for a more balanced approach. 
As an area capture mechanism causing a tie to damage both players can be used as a prevention mechanism - a small factor of screwage.

I generally like tile placement games - but this just didn't seem to click as games such as Carc did.

Dec 2016: Play with open scoring. Much better game.

Upgraded from 6.5 to 7. Good, but not as great as Tigris & Euphrates.

Very, very accessible and interactive game. Don't like the fact that once a scoring marker is captured, tiles around it are not that useful for the rest of the game, so choices get more limited as the game progresses.


May 2010: What I like:

* It's a tile laying game that allows you to play tiles anywhere on the board -- unlike most tile laying games in which you have to place a tile adjacent to one already on the board.

* It's almost like a trick-taking game in which each statue on the board represents a trick and the tiles played around it represents the trick itself. The nice thing about this one is that tile stay on the board, so you don't have to remember what you opponents have played already (unlike most trick-taking games).

What I don't like

* Considering how elegant the game play is, the end-game scoring is quite convoluted. Personally, I don't have much of a problem with it, but this is an actual barrier that prevents it from being a great gateway game. Also, the computational nature of the game (players have to constantly add things up to determine their standings for each statue), along with the end-game scoring, significantly puts a damper in the flow of the game.

I had so much fun playing this game. What started as quick game to play before the rest of my friends arrived, quickly became a highlight of that evening. I only meant to have a single game, and yet we ended up having 3 games, (that streak only interrupted by more guests arriving and expanding beyond the 4 player count). At the end of the session, one friend who had never played the game before, said "he might buy that game", which was huge as he owned no board games.

Samurai is relatively easy to teach. It has simple strategy of laying tiles to get an advantage influence advantage over your friends. A great puzzle that allows for smart plays. Could not recommend enough =)

RATING: 6
Interesting mechanic, and I might like it better if I play it a few more times, but on the first time it seemed to be a bit dry and confusing, even for a tile placement game. Later: reading other comments, I saw one player compared it to "Dots and Boxes" and I yelled "Exactly!!" It seems the best way to win is wait until your opponent is forced to hand you points. And because of the random tile drawing, I never got to play my three most powerful tiles. Still, I'd like to try it again, I might grow to love it.

great tile laying game. scales amazingly well across 2-4 players. clever initial placement and beginning tile selection will help to mitigate the luck of the draw later on. i'm often confused by the claim that all of knizia's games lack any connection to their themes, as samurai does a good job of simulating the subtleties involved in social and political maneuvering through the agonizing decisions one must make during game play.

This is an instant classic with my wife.  We can play two or three games in a sitting.  As players learn the game, the play changes from being strictly tactical to being very strategic.

I like the map-of-Japan game board.  The pieces are very nice.  When we were putting the game away after the 1st play my 10 year old daughter said:  "I just want to hold the pieces" and had a handful.....she liked the feel and weight of them.  The strategy/tactics make for a good competitive game.  Can be played quickly with beginners, or in depth.  The scalability from 2 to 4 players is good.

It makes a good 2P game.  Once it's set up it takes very little time to do a best of 3 games.

Update:  I played the newer edition which was nice, but the original game pieces are still the BEST!!

Place your samurai to gain control of markers for different sorts of power. Easy to learn but fairly challenging with nice pieces and an interesting jigsaw map of Japan.

Bit disappointing, really. I think it a tad too simple and I do not appreciate how careful planning can be swung against you with a powerful play of tiles from your opponents.

I guess this is a good game. I mean, I can appreciate the design. But, after a very small number of plays, it strikes me as pretty analyzable, if you make a mistake you give it to the next person down the row, and basically, because of the low interactivity of the pieces with each other, it basically ends up as being as difficult and calculating as, say, chess or another good abstract, without any strategic dimension whatsoever.

As a Knizia game, it rates a bit fat "meh".

There may be bias. It may be that, since Go is the game of my life, some of the Knizia tile-layers feel like neutered go.

RATING: 8
Admit I tend to love things Japanese, so probably am attracted as much to the pseudo-theme as I am to the game (despite the typo on the box front).  In addition, the need for multiple majorities (almost like building a consensus) seems very Japanese as opposed to just a simple majority.  In terms of gameplay, I like the series of small battles as one strives to gain control of the tokens.  Need to decide when and where to strike.

Marked down a point because of its excessive brain-melting qualities. I don't understand the fuss about the scoring, it seems reasonably straightforward.

Simple yet challenging, as players place tiles to gain influence on rice paddies, buddhas and high hats. Neat components, easy to learn, engaging.

RATING: 6
Samurai is a good game, but the victory conditions are needlessly confusing and just plain arbitrary--It is quite possible for the who captures the fewest pieces to win. 

Andy:  6B, 6H, 3R
Betty: 6B, 0H, 3R 
Carl:  0B, 6H, 3R
Diane: 0D, 0H, 4R

Diane wins because of the ties no wins either buddhas or hats, but if any of the first three players has one fewer buddha or hat, some other player wins.  Or Andy had captured one more rice, he'd win.

This fundamentally different from E&T/Ingenious where the "Highest low score wins" translates to a simple strategy of "always work on your lowest scoring color" and "AMAP score evenly in all colors"

This fits perfectly into my collection. Very little rules but hidden depth to the strategy.

I find that the game gets more random the more you play it.  A lot comes down to when you draw certain tiles, and who happens to be holding a certain tile when you make certain tactical moves.  Still interesting, but not as good as some of Kinizia's other greats.

Really good game with typically thin Knizia theme.  I love its scalability from 2 to 4 players.  Why has no one ever made more game pieces in that wonderful shiny black plastic?

RATING: 8
Knizia is great and all, but his mechanics aren't always distinct enough for my taste.

I've found out a bit more information, and it seems to be a quite a bit different in play than the other Knizia's I've chosen to take a look at. I think I'm interested for that reason and also because it's well-produced.

It also supposedly plays well with two.

Update: I played the computer version a few times and it seems ok. It's really hard to assess board games by playing them online, though. . . .

If I play it in real life, I'll revisit its rating.

A Knizia classic.  We used to play this a bunch in Austin years ago.  Nice abstract strategy (with a few euro-ish special effect tiles thrown in) with strangely cool appealing shiny black pieces made of some mysterious alien carapace.  Place your tiles to gain control of the pieces of alien carapace in Japanese cities.  The final scoring is wonky and weird in an interesting Knizia way. (Watch out for different rules versions about what happens if nobody has the most of a figure type: no winner, or most total pieces wins.)

RATING: 7.5
Good light, filler game - total abstract, but the black pieces are so cool and make the game for me.  I don't like the rule of putting your black pieces behind your screen in 3-4p - the memory aspect of tracking what everyone has gotten so far doesn't add anything to the game.  Too bad my wife doesn't really like it, or I would buy it as a good 2p game.

Beautiful but dull.  After 10 plays, I had enough.  Gameplay is tense and tight, but I'd much rather play something more fun.  Tile draft overwhelms me because I don't know enough about the game to pick an optimal starting hand.  Basically, you want to specialize in certain scoring categories and secure the trinkets for the category in the most efficient way possible.

This one is a favorite of mine. An easy to teach tile-laying game, but it has some great depth. The theme is pasted on, but it has such great production values it really doesn't matter. The game board is pieced together to create the islands of japan, and the components are top-notch.

update: game has started to lose it's appeal based on burn out from the iPad version. After enough plays, moves can seem obvious, and it's punishing on new players against the experienced. Still a great game, just lost some of its initial luster. downgraded to a 7

Good game, and I bought it cheaply too. I like that you can play it 2 player, and still have good strategic challenge. I havent tried with more players, but it could only get better. Also, it is short, and setup time is also short. Also i haven´t tried this form of strategy before, and i always like a differet type of strategy than what I am used to.

I thought it would be an interesting game. I like the concept and mechanics, as well as the pieces. However, it's been a failure in our 3 player group because, as one player said, it's tends to end up being 2 players ganging up against 1 - so why even bother playing the game. 2 player did not work well either, because one player often seems to get a runaway, unassailable lead early on. Haven't tried 4 players yet, but not likely to ever succeed in getting 3 others to play now. Quite disappointing.

[color=#CC0000]

"Too clever by half."

First, in my opinion the theme is just goofy, and conflicts with the game that hides under the covers.  I can get past mercenaries being worried about defending rice fields, but aspects of the game when combined with the theme indicate the sudden relocation of buildings or even farm fields to locations hundreds of miles away.  It just doesn't make sense.  I know, it's a game, I shouldn't care.  But if you're gonna make a theme where you move something, farm fields, swampy ones in particular, are a bad choice.

The geometry of the board is very carefully designed to make all conflict more or less uniform.  Every single play-space on the board borders [i]exactly[/i] two prize-spaces.  So there's no hot-spots, no places where you need to get in early or in force in order compete.  Though the artwork is beautifully illustrated, the underlying game structure is a uniform layer of gray paint.  Nothing draws the eye of a seasoned gamer in this one, no place on the board attracts attention or breeds concern.  There's not one single piece of high ground on the entire map.  That's intentional.  This is an abstract bent to fit the shape of Japan.

Because no place on the board is particularly more valuable than another, fiefdoms are arbitrary.  While this would appear to be a good foundation for a game of intense mental competition, some of the playing pieces allow you to just bounce the pieces on the board at an arbitrary moment in time.  Any tactical advantage that you grind out through careful play disappears in an instant by your opponent airlifting a rice field or temple, or magically moving an already-played piece to a new location.  After careful planning and strategy, after good play, you find yourself holding an empty cup.

But hey!  Random elements are good!  I LIKE working with risk!  It keeps a game fresh!  You just need to plan contingencies.  But how do you do that in Samurai?  There's no significant way to play your options.  The nature of the game means that it's virtually impossible to plan for the contingencies of someone yanking terrain out and moving it.  In theory you could move it back with [i]your[/i] yank-it piece, but it's too arbitrary a factor to make a sound assessment of risk and reward.  There simply isn't sufficient footing.  So each piece played is played in the moment, no looking forward, no hedging your bets.  So it's pretty much flat.  You can keep pieces until the end, but everyone else is doing that too.

So in theory, while half of you is managing strategy and tactics in a brain-burner setup the other half is forced to come to terms with "it's a whimsical game of fun and chance."  The two collided for me personally.  Throw in a complete dearth of critical or pivotal regions on the board and what results is trying to manage your few nuclear-grade options for onesie and twosie results.  I found myself not taking the time to make solid tactical decisions because they could be washed away on a moment's notice and weren't terribly valuable to begin with.  The game didn't call me to focus as others do.  At that point I became disenfranchised, the emotional immersion ended and I started looking over my shoulder to see what was being played on the table behind me.

Standard Knizia scoring strategy, which in other games like Ingenious I like but here is counter to theme and kind of arbitrary.  In my game with four players it seemed to completely break down, though with three I can't help but think it HAS to be better.  With four players it's the equivalent of the last-place horse being shot out from under its rider on the back stretch while the others continue to the finish line.  Knizia loves to mess with endings and in some games it works, in this one it just seemed hokey.

No clue why this game rates as high as it does.  Given the choice play Ingenious.  Ingenious is tight and unified, and produces a real narrative during play with points of high drama on the board and a need to nurture weak spots.

For me, Samurai is second-teir Knizia. It has neither the nuanced thematic elements of Lord of the Rings and Tigris & Euphrates, nor the simmering tension of Ra or Taj Mahal. But it's still a very well-done game, short and punchy with lots of interesting tactical considerations. The scoring does a good job at obscuring who is leading in any given situation, which is impressive since it's mostly open information.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly thematic for Knizia. As the boat and ronin tiles are played, you really get a feeling of a reinforcements swooping in (giving you the pros of a lucky game -- uncertainty and need to revise your strategy -- without compromising balance). 

The battle tends to move up and down the board, as the players contest the larger cities. The whole thing flows really well despite the strong seating influence (playtesting by Andreas Seyfarth, ha ha), with beautiful pacing and plenty of tactical choices. Scales very well from 2 to 3, but the 4P game is a bit too chaotic for my tastes.

Something that I love about this game is that the lengthy setup has a strong influence on the game's outcome. So it's 'game on' from the moment the box is opened.

Update: played it some more and it's still an 8 for me. The more that I play, the more subtlety is revealed. Recommended.

A game that makes you think and strategize, what city do I want to control and what am I willing to risk do do so; choose your battles might summarize the process. After several plays I find it is still a very enjoyable game. 

Updated - and a bit more in depth:
Medieval Japan - Samurai, buddhas, rice paddies and high hats.

Influencing the city and taking control - a complete shift in the thought process. I'll be the first to admit, it took me a little bit to develop a cohesive strategy; realizing that you need to win a few small skirmishes before you can win the big one. Do I commit all of my resources to this one city for a high number, or try and grab these three smaller ones instead. If I place this tile and win this city here, do I also give my opponent victories by completing the adjacent city?

I still don't think I've won, but again it is the playing of the game that is so enjoyable.

Got to try this on the iPhone against other players. Two marks of a well-designed majority game:

1. Simultaneously incentivizes the majority leader to “relax” instead of building the majority further, and the players playing catch-up to commit more resources (e.g. China, In the Shadow of the Emperor).
2. Allows you to control the timing of when majorities score (Stephensons Rocket, Tower of Babel)

Yes, that’s right: El Grande is a washed-up piece of FAIL using these two criteria.

Samurai is a clever design that passes both with flying colors. “Majority Relax” is prevalent in both the competition for individual figures and the end-game victory condition. The requirement to occupy a limited space, which is often shared between multiple arenas of competition, in order to add strength to an arena or two, makes for interesting spatial and timing considerations.

But I don’t love it as I’m not too enamored with the “each-person-has-own-fixed-draw-deck” concept (like Knizia’s Great Wall of China). It feels too much like a more random trick-taking (since you never know when you’ll get each tile), and I don’t like having to repeatedly keep track of everybody’s deck by looking at the board. I much prefer the concept in Knizia’s games where players draw from the same deck (Battle Line, Lost Cities), which allows you to bluff and push your luck.

Still, I think I’ll outgrow the own-draw-deck thing, especially since the rest of the game is good.

Need to play this again...

Things I like:

1) The spatial aspect of this game
2) The majority scoring
3) The board and tokens- very aesthetically pleasing.


One thing I don't like:

1) Not exciting enough to hook new players right away

If you like simple, pretty abstract games with a wee bit of strategy, check this one out.

I think random starting tiles is the way to go; I've never done as the rules suggest and chosen my starting 'hand'.

De darle al coco, pero sencillo al mismo tiempo.
A mi me encanta y siempre estoy dispuesto a echar una partidilla.
Edito: Veo que entra poco en juego. Demasiado cerebral (tipo ajedrez). A mi, para 2 jug. no me gusta, por que te puede salir humo de la cabeza... si te equivocas en algun movimiento, puedes incluso perder la partida.

I actually really enjoyed playing the game, then the scoring happened.  We somewhat misunderstood the rules on scoring, but even knowing the correct rules, the game would likely have ended as it did:Total stalemate(4 player)  That lead to a really unsatisfying experience for me, and I don't think I'd want to go through this for that again.  I know others might like it, they can rate it higher :)

2008: 9. Excellent tactics game with simple rules but tough choices for players to make as they second guess their opponents, and surprises coming from confrontation with other players.  Unique mechanics make it such that you need to both compete and co-operate with your opponents in order to optimize the use of your pieces.  Great production values and scales well from 2 to 4 players.

Abstract game with a Japanese "theme" pasted on. 

It's a little dry but not awful. I've only played it about 2 times and I wouldn't mind playing it more, but it often gets overlooked when trying to find a game to play. (Most of the people I play with want some sort of theme.)

I've only tried it with three, and it works for that number quite well.

[10 plays] Surprisingly simple rules for a game that so delightfully makes my head hurt. This game can play rapidly and is engaging from start to finish. The light theme is nevertheless painted with a master's brush.

Samurai is a beautiful game, elegant design, fully engages me during the game, but totally fails to capture my imagination before and after the game. I'm not saying anything negative other than I guess I usually prefer a stronger theme and less intense analysis in ftf play - it's great for pbem play though.

It took a few games to get into online and a couple more face-to-face, but this is now one of my clear favorites.

RATING: 8
I can see why this game fails to please people at the extremes. It doesn't offer the solid control or long-term strategy of Durch die Wuste, nor does it offer the simple fun of Einfach Genial. The scoring is kind of a bizarre perturbation of the mechanism used in Tigris and Euphrates. So what's going on in Samurai? Each player is trying to collect helmets, buddhas, and rice fields, and does so by surrounding these items with numbered influence tiles. You win if you manage to have the most tokens in at least two categories. But often, no one fulfills this condition. In a two player game, it is very common for each player to lead in one token type. To then determine who wins the tie, you check to see who has the most remaining tokens, once your leading tokens are removed. So, as in Ingenious and Tigris and Euphrates, it doesn't always pay to amass a huge number of only a single token. You need to strive for a balanced approach to win. You want to have the most of at least one kind of token, but shabby performance on other tokens will usually cost you the game. Thus Samurai rewards the player who can capture a broad variety of tokens, as well as take the lead in at least one category.

Given this kind of winning condition, the absense of total control in the game may frustrate some players. When you choose your moves, you have to plan for a rather wide variety of future contingencies - yet you must do this from a limited, random selection of your tiles. And the array of possibilities is too extensive to be subjected to thorough analysis during play. This isn't to say that analysis is impossible. Far from it! You must develop a sense of what can happen and act accordingly in order to win. Samurai doesn't offer total control for a few reasons: 1) you play tiles from a random draw (but you do get five tiles at a time to choose from) and 2) every player has one tile which allows them to exchange the positions of two selected tokens. So playing Samurai, you might become frustrated because you cannot execute a particular strategy for victory. I happen to like this about the game - that it forces you to play flexibly and adapt to ongoing developments. Any "strategy" you develop will only be good for about five turns - which is related to your five tile hand. As an aside, you do get to choose your initial five tiles. Despite this focus on tactical problem-solving, you still have to watch what is happening in the long run to do well. You don't want to allow opponents to lock out one of the three token types, for instance.

Samurai plays fairly quickly, scales really well from 2-4 players, and is a fun game. Some of my GeekBuddies note that it is missing the "fun factor", and although the gameplay is obviously "Knizia" and has that little bit of a dry feel to it, I disagree with them. I think Samurai is rather fun, and the best of Knizia's tile-laying trilogy. I am happy to admit that this is a matter of taste, however. One neat aspect of Samurai is that, especially in 3 and 4 player games, it boasts player elimination. This is why you keep the tokens you have won a secret behind your screen - if everyone displayed them, player A might realize well before the game is over that it is impossible for him to win. But given the tricksyness of the scoring conditions and player A's non-eidetic memory, it is doubtful player A will be able to figure this out before the game concludes. And like I said, it plays fast enough that it doesn't really matter. In the two player game, you do not hide your tokens. Occasionally, this means that two astute players will see who the inevitable winner is before the last tile is layed. In one recent game, the outcome had been decided when there were still seven tokens (one third of the total) yet to be claimed. This is a minor gripe, if it is a gripe at all. The point is: the game does reward skilfull play and does punish poor play - enough to occasionally eliminate players.

If you like games that have some strategy, but more of a tactical focus, and you don't mind a little bit of randomness and loss of control, give Samurai a try. I think it's a lot of fun!
(I only have one concern - not my idea originally - that Samurai may fall prey to Tic-Tac-Toe-ism, that is, that it is "solvable" and that for two players who have solved it the outcome will be (90%) a matter of turn order.)

RATING: 9
Very intense tile laying game, one of the best.  Extremely tense, as strategies require a lot of planning but are ceaselessly subject to vicious surprises from your opponents.  A kingmaker problem at the end keeps it from being a 10, so you need to assemble 3 or 4 pretty evenly matched players to get the full enjoyment from this game.

Igazi absztrakt, a szerencsét csak minimálisan tartalmazó, gyönyörűen kivitelezett játék. Knizia egyik mesterműve. Rizs, süveg és budha jelzőkért megy a versengés, amelyek mindig véletlenszerűen kerülnek fel a Japán szigetvilágot ábrázoló táblán lévő városokra és falukra. A játékosoknak ezeket kell megszerezniük hatszög alakú lapkákkal ezen területek mellé rakva különböző mértékű befolyást szerezve. A három gyűjthető dolog egyikéből mindenképp többséget kell szereznünk a játék végére, csak így lehet esélyünk a nyerésre. Változó játékosszámmal is jól működő társas.

[2012-07-07]
Annyit azért változtatok a fentieken, hogy a szerencse azért nem olyan kicsi. Illetve szerintem fontos úgy játszani, hogy az első 5 lapját mindenki választja és nem véletlenszerűen húzódnak.

Beautiful board, great pieces, elegant design, overall a game that I deeply respect, just not one that I have a lot of fun playing.  I suspect that my ratings would go up if I played it more as it seems deep enough to give more rewarding play to those that put more into the game, but I just don't have the desire to play it again.  There just isn't much of a fun factor.  

I don't mind brain burners, but the luck and chaos make all the tough choices often pointless.  I'm sure I'm just whining, but it irritates me that I build up strong positions where a couple well placed tiles played against you throw the whole thing out the window. I understand how people can love the game, but there is just no love for it on my part.

I suppose this is a good game. Generally I'm not a fan of Reiner Knizia games. This game is a typical 'puzzle' type strategy game - certainly it's well designed and easy to play without being overly complex. There is minimal 'luck' factor (except for tile draws) and there are no play imbalances because everyone has the same resources. Usually I like more variety and theme to my games. But if you like thinking puzzle type games then this is a decent option.

RATING: 6
I've dropped my rating on this, as recent plays have left me a bit cold.  It's taken me some reflection to see what was bugging me.  The basic mechanic is similar to the old pencil-and-paper game 'dots and boxes', where the person who closes the box scores, and so the key defensive play is to NOT make the third side.
The problem is that Samurai is multi-player, so when you have one player who is careless/unskilled, the player immediately following reaps an undeserved and unbalancing bounty.  I don't care for games where you can win by choosing the correct chair at game start, and while I am exaggerating how big of a problem it has been so far, I can't deny that it has robbed Samurai of its early luster with me.  Off to the attic with you (for the time being)!

RATING: 8
Samurai by Reiner Knizia is an area influence game using tile-laying on a hex-grid of feudal Japan.  All players have identical hands of tiles.  The object is to collect majorities in captured pieces.  There are three types of pieces: Buddhas, Rice paddies, and High Helmets.  Equal numbers of each piece type are randomly placed in towns throughout Japan.  Pieces are captured by placing tiles around towns containing pieces.  When a town is surrounded by tiles, the pieces are given to the player(s) who had the most influence over them.  Tiles with a picture of a Buddha and the number 2, for example, exert an influence of 2 on the Buddha pieces in any adjacent town.  There are also wild card tiles (Samurai and Ronin for land, Ship tiles for sea hexes) that exert influence on all pieces in adjacent towns according to the number value of the tile.  Captured pieces are kept hidden, as the victory conditions depend on obtaining majorities.

Samurai has beautiful components, difficult decisions, ridiculously simple rules, and a satisfying conclusion.  2p and 3p are great.  I've only played one 4p game, which felt chaotic.

My usual gaming tastes usually do not include abstract tile-placing games (except for Tigris and Euphrates, which is amazing) and this one is no different.

Plus the pieces in the physical game are gorgeous but past that there's just not much substance here.

I wasn't expecting a "samurai" game that came in a decent-sized box to end up feeling like a light filler game.  Certainly the theme is about as relevant as "Balloon Cup".  They could just as easily have made this game about space pirates gathering hazardous waste from Uranus, and it would not have lost any of its playability.  But that being said, I guess they had to choose SOME sort of a theme, so why not medieval Japan?  At least they have taken their chosen theme and created a very beautifully-produced game.  The problem is, it's just not that terribly interesting to play.  The four player game in particular seems a little too random for a game with so little randomness built into the mechanics, and leaves me with the odd feeling of having just one simple action to do but too many options for where to do it.  I'd much rather play a game of "Through The Desert" for a comparable level of simplicity and number of players.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10

RATING: 7.5
On a hex map in the shape of Japan, place cute plastic bits of three types (buddhas, hats, rice paddies) in the cities. Players place tiles valued 2-4 in those three types, plus wild tiles (samurai, boats) and special ability tiles (swap, move). When a city is completely surrounded, bits go to whoever has the highest strength in that suit.

A limited hand of 5 randomly-drawn tiles adds a bit of luck but keeps AP from being unbearable. Much of the game is in deliberately avoiding (or deliberately creating) opportunities for the next player, which creates an obvious left-right binding problem with more than two players of unequal skill. Very nice game, all up, with gorgeous production.

RATING: 7
[Hans im Glück 1998 edition] {Japan; tile-laying, area-majority, set-collection} Samurai is a nice tile-laying game with tenuous theme I would rather classify this as an abstract game even has it has partial information and involves tile draw. Scalable but it's too tight for a 2p game.

It's moderately deep and involves strong player interaction. A player has to continually evaluate the situation and react promptly to his opponents' moves, esp. the special ones. If he cannot predict how other acts, those special tokens can change the situation dramatically and destroy his entire game plan. Other than wisely playing the tokens, it is essential to carefully place figures and choose the initial 5 tokens during game preparation. One would have lost the game if he acted carelessly at the game preparation.

Luck is not important in this game although it involves tile draw. Players still have many controls over the tile draw by selecting the initial hand, having 5 tokens in the hand, determining the right time and place to place a token. I prefer to have some 1-2 samurais in my initial hand. The 'Ronin' token is of high strategic value - use it very wisely.

The unique, though strange, scoring system differentiates Samurai from other similar games. In Samurai, a player shall strive to dominate one figure and capture some other figures to secure his position. In addition, Samurai has a sudden game end. Therefore, players have to compete aggressively for the figures before the game suddenly ends.

The game components are sturdy and beautiful. The idea of assembling game board for different number of players is quite smart.

One of my favorites, extremely tight game where wasting time/moves will cost you any chance of winning.  (The way a game should be).  Aside from that the production value is extremely high, very pretty to look at. There is a bit of an endgame funkyness in that sometime you have to make moves tha will ultimately help your opponents more than you,  so thinking well ahead is definately needed

Dio Knizijine 'tile placement trilogije'. Odlična i vrlo brza igra. Svi točno znaju što će dobiti, jer imaju svoj komplet tileova, samo ne znaju kad. Tako ako nekoga ne ide sreća na početku partije, bolje se pripazi jer prema kraju će početi 'sijevati'. (Na dlaku ista stvar je prenesena u također odličnu Neuroshimu Hex)

I played this for the first time last night. I liked the game play but I can see that it wouldn't be a good fit for my family.  I played with two other experienced players (and lost badly!) but even they took a long time on their turn.  The thing that I didn't really like was that the end game scoring is  too much of a mystery.  Unless you track what the other players win it's hard to tell where you stand and this had a negative influence on my ability to play near the end of the game.  Of course this just could be my lack of experience with the game.

Okay, I can see why this is a classic.  Vintage Knizia right here.  Tons of choices, simple rules, the right amount of player interaction.  This is the definition of elegance.  

We've only played two-player so far, but I imagine this will scale well.  If it does, it could easily be a 10.

RATING: 7
Abstract tile-laying with a tenuous Japanese feudal theme. There are three different types of figures located on cities, towns and villages and the object is to surround these areas with tiles that correspond with the type of figure. There are 'wild-card' tokens such as the eponymous samurai as well as ones depicting ronin and ships, and once an area containing figures is surrounded the player with the highest total surrounding them wins the figure. It's a very simple game in many ways, especially to learn, but there is also a great deal of strategy required in order to play successfully. Like so many abstract games the theme feels like something of an afterthought and it could have been applied to any subject matter really. Nevertheless, this is a solid Reiner Knizia game but I feel it wouldn't be quite as highly regarded if it didn't have his name attached to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played 10+ times.  Samurai is great.  Each player has an identical set of 20 tiles.  You have a hand of five and you are sending out your warriors to surround and conquer the various resources around Japan.  When a location is surrounded the one or more resources on the space are given to the player who committed the most effort towards winning that particular resource.  At the end if you have a majority in two of the three resources you win.  If not there is a complicated Reiner Knizia tie breaking mechanism. 

The pieces are beautiful and the game is quick and tense. I'm definitely a Samurai fan.  2008/12/15

I am defintely impressed. A for concept, A for mechanics, etc. The design is very clean, I dont think we had any rules issues. The play is deep (we played 3 players)and the time frame is about perfect (45 min IIRC). Best of all it fills a hard to fill niche: an abstract game (arguably) for more than 2 players. To do this the game requires that you draw tiles to create some randomness which is a decent solution to the problem. 

HOwever, the issue comes down to whether the victory conditions are satisfying or not. With only 3 commodities and 3 players it is hard to win a convincing 2 commodity win (where one player gains a plurality in two commodities). Thus, each player wins one commodity and the winner is then the one who has the most of this non winning commodity. Ex:

A wins 3-3-2 commodities, B 4-2-2 C 4-3-1

Note you don’t  win the commodity if you tie, so it’s possible that B or C could have not won any. But assuming each player won one commodity, then A wins because he has 5 of the non winning brand (3+2). Was he clever or just fortunate in what the other two did? 

 It’s still a good game, but this aspect is troubling 
My feeling is that history will judge this game on whether the winning conditions are really clever or really just nonsense.

RATING: 9
This game always challenges me and leaves me thinking what a simple yet brilliant game it is.  Every turn forces very difficult choices to be made.  The indirect scoring rules also provide an element of doubt to creep into your mind, which furthers your level of anxiety.  The game looks great, and the theme is good.  My only criticism is that there is very little social interaction during game play - almost no talking at all in fact.  There is plenty of player interaction on the board however.  Top game.  --Just upgraded my rating from 8 to 9 (28-03-2008).  Genius game.

This game is a lot of fun.  The scoring system is non-traditional, which makes it a little hard to explain, but it also makes the game more interesting.  Less dry than your typical Knizia too.

Ouch!  I may get strung up for this one, but Samurai seems to not know what type of game it wants to be - abstract, or lightweight, or what have you.  For an abstract, it has an insane amount of luck due to the tile draw (especially with respect to the "bonus move" tiles), but it is too dry to be a light game (despite being rather short).  If you want to be abstract, be abstract.

I love this game. It plays very decently with 2-3-4 players as well as playing differently tactically. Some players dislike the "chaos" of the four player game, but after a number of plays, I believe the reality is that you have to approach the game very differently depending on the number of players.

Great game, and my wife really seems to like it, too.  Unlike apparently everybody else, I am not too fond of the artwork, especially on the tiles (probably due to my introduction to the computer version first).  Plays fast, and setup is not too painful.  Also, very importantly, it scales excellently from 2-4 players.  More games should use the adjusted board size to accommodate varying numbers of players (hats off to Wallenstein, China, and Through the Desert).

I'll admit that I really don't quite 'get' Samurai yet.  So, I feel like my rating can easily move up as I get the chance to play some more.  I felt like I was simply stuck in a cycle of the other players swooping in on areas that I was strong, and then I had no chance at all on my turn to get back at them.  Then, the cycle would repeat.  But like I said, if I get to play more and get better 'vision', I think my rating will climb.

One of my favorite area control games. Very beautiful, simple, and deep. It's one of those peaceful, calming games; even when opponents foil your plans, it doesn't feel so much like a "block" as it does another piece of a puzzle you have to figure out. The components are gorgeous and fun to play with and the rules are extremely easy to learn. The game compels you to try many different strategies and seems like it would have a lot of longevity because of this. It scales very well from 2-4, as the map varies with different numbers of players. Sometimes, the game is decided long before it's over, but against equally matched players it can be tense right up until the finish. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very tactical game that moves along quickly, presents lots of tough choices and leaves room for some clever moves. Theme and mechanics work very well together, and the bits and map are beautiful. For what's basically a tile-laying abstract game, this one somehow evokes plenty of period flavor. Best with three players. One of my all-time favorites.

Played a few two player games now. It was exactly what I was looking for.  A 30-45 minute game to teach and play, that can effectively be played as a thoughtful filler. I really like Reiner...and Tigris is one of my favorites, so it shouldn't shock me that this is good.  I really think this game could be best with 3, maybe 4 players, and I plan on playing it that way very soon.

RATING: 7
Samurai is an elegant and beautiful game that ranks as one of Knizia's best influence titles. Normally, I long for more action and more sparring; what's up with Asian themes being used when conflict is conspicuously absent?  (See Shogun.)  Yet for thoughtful conflict among more than two players, this is a handsome choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to pick up the game, yet deep in strategy. A slight mix of Area Control and tactical tile play. The Samurai theme is very, very light. Its awesome with any amount of players since the board scales.

Simple, engaging, plays in under an hour, with plenty to consider. The scoring is not as tough as some would have you think (and was unfairly criticized when it was first released), and I think it's a big part of what makes this a great game. One of Knizia's top 10, IMHO.

RATING: 9
There isn't really anything I dislike about this game. Except maybe the player count - while Japan is probably a bit too small to play this game in with more than 4, the ability to play with more than 4 is quite likely the only reason I rate 7 Wonders and The Resistance higher than this.

RATING: 7
Simple to learn, incredibly elegant mechanics, and scales unbelievably well to any number of players.  I feel I should be rating it higher, and yet, I find it's missing an indescribable 'fun factor.'  This may be due to the fact other players' tiles are hidden, which means there isn't a lot of room for table talk and the like.  Everyone just stares quietly at the board while they make their move.

As an aside, I specifically bought it to play during a trip to Japan.  Yes, I know I'm awesome, thank you.

It fills the 3 player game niche nicely. Enjoyed much more with repeated plays.  I like the constant tactical manuevering this game forces you to make.

Feels timeless.

A good game but...what's this got to do with Fedual Japan? Not a damn thing.  Another Knizia game that doesn't do anything to wrap you up in the theme, but it's still a fun to put those pretty little shiny black plastic pieces down. The game is really made by the special tiles, take them out and it's going to be much more boring.  This is one of those from time to time played games and not a frequent returner to the table.

A great game of area control.

It's fast (the box says it takes around 45 min to 1 hour, but if everyone knows how to play it, it´s usually played in about 30 to 40 minutes), smart and has good interaction between players. Everything just works very well.

One of Knizia's best.

The first game took around 10 minutes to read and explain the rules, and just over half an hour to play. Subsequent games clocked in around 25 minutes (with 2 players)! The samurai/Japanese theme feels a bit artificial, but the game is elegant and tremendous fun. I very much enjoy ingenious, but the two special action tiles and the fast tiles make this a more exciting game. It's very well balanced game, victory is never assured, a clever tile combination can snatch it all away. Can't wait to play again. The three and four player maps are also amazing, although as expected the duration of the game does increase.

Played for the first time in the same session as Metropolys, which was an interesting 1-2. We played twice; 3 and 2 player.

The subtlety seems to be in efficient tile placement, ensuring that others help you to surround the caste pieces. Show intent too soon and you'll have to burn tiles for little gain, just to surround the piece you want and have your investment pay back. 

I don't like the special tiles. Like the tactics cards in Battle line they add swinginess that I don't enjoy. 

But overall I liked it. Not a T&E killer but good, elegant design. The FF version has surprisingly tasteful components, but I would aim to pick the original

The random tile draw seems to work for the theme.  It's very tense.  I prefer TTD by miles.  Great with two.

RATING: 4
A wonderful, fairly abstract, but beautifully themed and cleverly designed game that suffers from three problems, two minor and one major.  The minor problems are: A) the endgame conditions, with open scoring, tend to produce a lot of AP and B) the random setup is awkward and the placed setup is tedious.

The major problem is that this game is, in my opinion, the poster child for horrible left-right binding.  The somewhat Go-like surround-to-score rule makes managing play tempo absolutely crucial and ensures that the winner *will* be the player to the left of the weakest player.

If you can ever manage to find 3 other players all equally strong, then this game is an 8; without this, it's a 2.  I've compromised and called it a 4.

Replaying it after almost a decade, I was amazed at how well this game withstood the test of time. In 2010, the game still stands proud among the other, more recent, family games of my collection. Rules are easily explained, downtime neglectable and game length is a pleasant 45 minutes. More importantly, my girlfriend likes it just fine with only two players. Oh, and the black plexiglass game pieces still impress.

This is a fantastic game when it has pace and forward momentum. For some reason though, this game induces AP in almost everyone I introduce it to. Perhaps the austerity of the board and components leads people to think that this should be treated as a brain-burner.

Tile-laying game with an oblique shogun-period Japan theme. Players have the same set of tiles from which 5 are selected to form their "starting hand" - the remainder will be randomly drawn to replace used tiles as the game progresses. Tiles are laid on a Japan-shaped board, to add influence on cities and eventually collect three different types of figures - Buddhas, Noble Hats, and Rice Fields. The winner will have the most figures in the most categories. Other than the less than intuitive victory conditions, Samurai is actually quite simple to learn but presents "gamer's game" depth. The modular board allows excellent scaling from 2P, 3P, and 4P. Serves a unique niche because I find it stands in the space between a gateway and a more complex gamer's game. Components are fantastic, especially the gorgeous Buddha, hat, and rice field figures.

The fastest (mostly) abstract game that I still find satisfying.  Pieces and tiles are all really neat.  Theme is tacked on, but not distracting.  The most fascinating and ruthless example of the importance of tempo in any game I've seen.  The moment that you may think you've got a piece locked down, your opponent can spring a surprise on you and take it away.  One of the best games I know for three players, and two is a whole different experience that's also great.  Four is simply too many and should be avoided.

Ten plays years ago, one play now. Great area majority game set in Japan. Nicely balanced board, which looks like it is not. But yes, every hex is connected to one or two scoring hexes, not zero, not three, nothing else. Use of "fast attack" troops is key to success as well as the other special tiles. Very nice game, but usually silence follows, when players are staring at the board and making plans. There is some downtime, but since the board doesn't change much in one round, it can be used for planning.

One play more, no change. I just need to pay more attention to what others are collecting and not just focus on my play.

This is essentially an abstract game, the theme is utterly superfluous, still, the bits are nice :)  Having said that, it is a pretty nifty abstract.  It has some area control elements, and a Knizian majority scoring mechanism.  You place tokens trying to capture pieces.  Controlling 2 of 3 pieces or having the most pieces in a category if two people tie wins you the game.  The game plays quick and was pretty easy to understand.  It plays particularly well with with 2 players.

A trivial-to-learn game with lots of tactical depth. Great with two players.

You have to capture pieces (warriors, peasants, rice) by placing more high-numbered tiles around them than your opponent.

I don't enjoy it as much as Through the Desert because it feels like a bit of a math-out. Lots of counting required to decide where to optimally place your tiles. 

The theme is also weaker than Through the Desert or Tigris and Euphrates. For a simpler game, I'd recommend Through the Desert. For a tactical civilisation/war game, I'd suggest Tigris.

RATING: 8
A game we played on 4th August, and belatedly reported on, was the Knizia tile-laying Samurai-themed and self-titled; 'Samurai' which aims to recreated the strategic wars of succession during the medieval era of Japan's history. 

The aim of the game is to acquire (subvert/manipulate) the three key factions relating to the state; buke (nobility) represented by the castles playing piece, the religious castes represented by the shrines (Shintoism) and temples (Buddhism) and the heimen (farmers) represented by the wheat sheaf playing piece. They achieve this by using tiles representing influence amongst their clans who match the three playing pieces with matching pictures on tiles with an assigned range of values from one to four. The higher the value, the more effect they have, so placing them against the forty or so playing pieces is eventually resolved by comparing aggregate scores surrounding each playing piece. 

Each player draws four, if I remember correctly, specific tiles of their choice and hide these behind their nicely designed shoji screen, and depending on how many tiles are played during their turn (*), their replacements are the drawn randomly and turned over behind the player's screen, bringing their playing set back up to four. There are four or five tiles with special abilities to represent the machinations associated with siezing the shogunate and control of the emperor such as replacing a tile already played with this special tile so that the former's benefit may be re-used. The naval pieces are all special in that they can be played in addition to the usual one played by each player in their turn (*). Another tile allows a playing piece being potentially acquired to be swapped with another so that a concentration of buddha tiles suddenly are of no use when the playing piece is swapped with a wheat sheaf, for instance.

This skullduggery happened quite a lot during our game. The map onto which the playing pieces of the three factions are randomly placed in sequence by those participating represents the four main islands of Japan. The samurai tiles have one advantage, similar with the naval pieces too, in that they can be used to subvert any of the three types of playing piece, whereas the faction specific tiles can only be used against an identical playing piece. Therein lies the skill of placement. The blurb describes this quite succinctly in that players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback Samurai and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each playing piece is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group, representing their successful subversion of that samurai clan or priestly or farming community. 

Gameplay continues until all the playing pieces of each faction have been removed from the board or four playing pieces have been removed from play due to a tie for influence. At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each faction type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, "non-majority" symbols each player has collected. When we played, the other three players did have a 'second go' which I think prejudiced the outcome as this enabled them to place more effectively which I did raise at the time. What's done is done but I am not an advocate of this given the rules were clearly explained at the start. In any event, I like the game, and it can probably be played in around forty-five to sixty minutes with new players and potentially, near to half that with those who have played a few times. A game i would recommend, Anjin-san.

Really like this as well as the card game even though It seems I suck at both. Like the player interaction and the
puzzle element as well as the Tigris and Euphrates-style scoring. The only thing I don't like is the screens because it's silly and unnecessary to try to keep track of the pieces your opponents collect in a game where you should rely heavily on skill. Skill+memorization=short circuit. You can choose to play without the screens though. Would love to have the 1998 edition but only for trade or cheap. 

Edit: caved and bought vintage edition off ebay.

RATING: 7
I love how the game has elements of slow accumulation of power and at the same time moments of "take that" thrown in, and it seems one has to balance the timing of one's power plays. Samurai has the advantage of being one of those beautiful, simple, yet engrossing games, which makes it perfectly suitable for introducing to non-gamers. On the other hand you have gamers who consider this their favorite game, and I can see why: it is a very elegant package of tension, some luck, and much to think about. An indispensable game in my collection, in large part because it scales from 2-4 players (although with 4 it can get a little chaotic).

Hm.  There's almost a certain Age of Steam element to the game, in that the board is static, and the way that the pieces come out on the board dictates the strategy of your play.  There's also the way that you place certain pieces, based on when you want to commit to certain types of pieces.  The two tiles that allow you to change things on the board are also nice, but limit your choices if drawn too early in the game.  The random setup of the board and the random draw of tiles helps with the replayability of the game, but will the random draw of tiles affect the win ratio that much?  Hmmm....

An excellent game. Scales fairly well from 2-4 players. I am not too fond of it at 4 but would be willing to play.

The biggest thing going for this game is that it has a very simple ruleset (an important aspect for me in middle weight games) but fairly deep gameplay. So, it is easy to introduce it to new players and as they start playing it, they discover new layers to the game. 

 The game does give chances for some spectacular moves with the special tiles, which I like.  

The biggest negative is that it can get a little calculational towards the end and that can make it feel a bit dry/analytical

Hello again, Knizia.
Area influence via tile placement.
Set collecting.
Simple mechanics, complex dynamic!
Complex(ish) scoring.
Light-medium weight (not many rules, just slightly detailed ones to keep track of).
Medium player interaction.
Very low theme application.

There's some light math involved when planning for and claiming scoring pieces but it's simple and good for the brain. Ultimately simple and easy to play.

A tile-laying game is ostensibly set in medieval Japan. Players use hexagonal tiles to surround cities, which have one to three different figures: rice paddies, buddhas, or high hats. The tiles represent influence on particular facets of the cities, and the highest influence on a figure when the city is surrounded takes that figure. The object of the game is to have more of any one else in one category, and then have the most remaining figures.

Set in medieval Japan, this is an  excellent tile-laying game by the German master designer Reiner Knizia.  Players compete to win over the peasant, noble, and religious classes of citizens in the various cities around Japan.  Whoever is most successful will be the new emporer.  It is fun, fast to setup & play, has nail-biting decisions and beautiful components.  The game is different with 2,3, or 4 players, but always fantastic.

For a very light abstract game this one is very good...I enjoy the challenges presented in the long and narrow map of Japan. I prefer a game with more to think about than what this offers, but for its type, it is probably one of the best.

RATING: 9
Brain-burner.  Tons of tactical decisions you must make every turn.  Not a theme that I normally have any interest in, but because it is from Reiner Knizia, it is an abstract.

I love this game!

My favorite Knizia game by a mile.  Because of the varied layout of the board and having no clue what tile you will draw next, this is a very tactically oriented game.  

It also has the best scalability of any game I've ever played.  Game is from two to four players, so for every player above two, all you do is add an extra piece to the game board. 

Area control mechanic.  Object of the game is to use your pieces to capture a number of Buddhas, rice fields and high hats (nobles or priests, I guess) which are inside of cities or villages.    To do this you use samurais, ships, and other pieces that vary in the amount of influence they project on the Buddhas, rice fields and high hats.

Very much a cat-and-mouse style of play, Samurai creates EXTREMELY HIGH tension.  If you don't fully think through on the benefits or consequences of laying a tile in a particular section of the board, you may be setting yourself up for a shellacking.

There are specialty tiles that allow you to move a piece you previously placed on the board as well as replacing a tile to your hand that was part of a captured territory. 

Fun.  Very tense, but a very enjoyable experience in gaming.  Simplistic rules with deep complexity levels.  

Needs to be in the Game Hall of Fame.  Wish there were one...  :)

Any tile-laying game my husband likes gets a high rating.  Not to mention, I love this one.  We're not ones to play long, drawn out games, so this one fits the bill.

Have tired of this a bit and passed it on, but will keep the rating because the game is worthy of it.

Played several times face-to-face, and a few times on Mabiweb. A typical game I should play more often, since every time I play it again, I end up wondering why I waited so long. Except maybe for the scoring system, the rules are surprisingly simple, yet the game is deep. Randomness is minimized thanks to the initial selection of tiles (I still haven't found out which my favorite set is). Overall, a very nice game.

RATING: 8.1
Cool area control/influence game. Another masterful game from Rio Grande. Great mechanics. Playing the game is simple but yet it requires a great deal strategic thinking. The game plays in less than an hour with four people. Scoring is a little strange (based on "most of" which can actually eliminate leaders - see the rules), but not a deterrent to playing or owning the game.

Much better than I expected. There is actually a nice amount of conflict in this both indirect and direct. Still not sure how to approach the initial placement or what tiles to keep at first but I feel like there is a good amount of life in this game. The screwy tiles kind of irk me a bit and feel slightly out of place but it does add a dimension of direct conflict and variability.

{ P - 2 [3] [4] }

Reasonably short and engrossing tile-layer with one inexorable problem. People place in good locations while avoiding set-up plays, but sooner or later the game arrives at the point where everything is a set-up play. Boats can help negate this, and there is a balance to be discovered between avoiding set-up plays and avoiding inefficiently capturing too many cities by surrounding them yourself, but every game I've played between people of equivalent skill boils down to end-game uncertainty. (Or worse, who didn't get screwed over on the draw.) For what it's worth, probably the coolest and most seamless method of player scaling.

Fun - abstract as hell... and the SCORING! Other than T&E I have never seen a game that causes more head scratching during final scoring. For that reason alone we do not play this often. Oh but the bits and the board... one of the most beautiful games I have seen.

A great strat game with a  simple set of rules.  This was my first R.K. game that 'LB' introduced me to.

RATING: 7.5
So the theme is tacked on, it's still a clever merge of tile laying and area influence. Easy to teach as well and plays quickly. Like many of Knizia's games, it borders on a mathematical exercise and so won't be for everyone, but I enjoy pulling it out from time to time.

Beautiful game in every sense.  The box artwork is fantastic and the bits are incredible.  Not my type of game normally, but I absolutely loved it the first few times I played.

RATING: 8
A tile laying game based on Japan, though it could easily have been designed with any other theme. Having said that, the use of Japan as a backdrop does add some flavour to the game.

The concept behind the game is relatively straightforward (maximising influence on neighbouring pieces so as to capture them). Randomness is introduced by the drawing of tiles. Players' strategy will have to evolve based on the tiles drawn. Use up your "good" tiles too early, and you will not be able to defend the latter pieces. Use them too late, and they will be ineffective! 

An intriguing game with some hard decisions to make.

RATING: 10
I believe Samurai by Reiner Knizia (Rio Grande) could very well be a model for "The Perfect Game". 

1) The rules are brief and easily grasped through the excellent examples, or after just one play 
2) The random tile and victory point distribution makes each game unique without over reliance on luck 
3) The classic ancient Japanese stylized gameboard and all the components are elegant and appealing 
4) The game is as engaging and challenging with 2 as it is with 3 or 4 
5) The scoring system used, and ability to shift tactics on the fly with the inclusion of specialty tiles, provides a player with several options on how to achieve victory.

This truly is a great game. It's very abstract, but still light and with components perfect for the theme.

It is easy to introduce to non-gamers, while still being a fun challenge for gamers. I am a big fan of this game.

The downsides is the huge box, terrible insert, and out-of-the-box rubber banded components. Still the game is very good, and this shouldn't deter anyone.

A fast, meaty, abstract Euro with Knizia twist scoring.  If you like trying to score majorities with equal measures of strong planning ahead and huge shifts in position for pieces if someone pulls off a big move you'll like navigating the decisions of Samurai. I like this quite a bit with 3 or 4 and its quickly becoming one of my favorite hour or less, abstractish games to wind up or down a game night right up there with Taluva.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An area majority game in which each tile can at most exert influence over two pieces on the board.  The design itself wasn't exactly groundbreaking, but the decisions involved can be excrutiating.  The random draws do add a certain element of uncontrollable chaos, which can often result in opportunity lost when you just can't get the tile you need to make your claim.

Didn't care for ways how a game could end prematurely, especially when you get shut out of the pieces that are practically in the bag for you.  The convoluted scoring is rather annoying than clever.  Samurai is decent but not great in my book.

I like this game, but I have a couple of "not quite likes" about it.  I know that it is supposed to be random (the drawing of the tiles) but I think it would be a better, yet diffent game if you were able to pick the tile you wanted.  In this reguard, I don't think it is a deep strategy game, but could be with the inclusion of this house rule.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed this, and it really seems like there could be a very deep strategic element that would lead to longer, chess-like games, but even as a casual game it can work (as long as everyone is in that mode) since the rules and gameplay are simple and straightforward.

But the figures are cool and the gameplay is inspired.  Would probably improve with a playclock.

RATING: 8.5
The plexiglass pieces are the best bits I've ever experienced in a game.  The modular map of Japan, which merely omits an island for each player fewer, is simply brilliantly designed.  This is a fairly fast and sneaky game of influence and control.  Some people who play this seem to actively hate the scoring system's assertion that if two people tie for a lead, they are both worthless.  I love that mechanism:  It means you not only have to strive for a lead, but must be very attentive to attaining it.

Very nice and easy game. Pros includes fast setup, simple rules (could be explained in 5-10 minutes) and short game play (less than hour).

As cons (no everyone would agree those are cons) I could mention, that game requires little to no social interaction - it requires only logic and tactic skills, but no politics.

Falls into the realms of Carcasonne which means its a winner with my wife and son. Reminds me of a mixture of Carcasonne and Lost Cities. Its not deep but its more confrontational than either of the former so its a nice little step up for the not so serious gamers.

Edit: I've played this a lot on iPad now and I can say that I don't like 4 player. Its impossible to really plan ahead and is too chaotic. 3 players is probably Max but 2 is sweet.

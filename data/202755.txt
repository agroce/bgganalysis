Insta-hit on the table. Solid card game with ideal player interraction.

RATING: 8
Fun, fluid game of card interactions, with a simple set of actions that pan out into a nice range and depth of play. I like the fantasy theme, the various profession abilities do feel thematic when you thing about them, so I'm likely to purchase the two future Fantasy sets so I can vary up each game session. However, I probably won't go back and bother with the older sets. Just having the 18 fantasy professions will suit my purposes.

Game play is good, but some of the production choices are a bit questionable. The play aids have type that is far too small, and the art is generic. However, there's an icon reference on the back of the rules that gets around this (minor) problem, and you'll use the references less and less once you know the game.

An okay set collection game where each set gives bonuses when you add to the set.  Generic fantasy theme that doesn't really matter, although the font they chose for the set names is awful and hard to read from across the table.

All the winners made use of getting extra points from farmers.

Good 3-player game

This is the same as Guildhall, the comments for both should be the same.

It sounds like the original game with different art/iconography and a few varied cards. (I thought the original iconography worked fine?)

Neutral - on occasion

Everything is fine. I just found that the abilities of cards are not that satisfying. Maybe other sets(Alliance, Coalition) have more interesting cards, I should check them out.

A forced mechanics, shuffling and pushing cards all over the table, hideous graphics... - that's not a recipe for a game that would appeal to me...

2017-10-29 - This is a pretty great set collection card game. The original was great, this one is too. I like some of the changes they have made with this new version (the color coding for more balanced swapping out of roles), and don't like some others (why didn't they keep the old iconography?). This is a great game, regardless, and more roles is always good.

Not a big fan of Guildhall.   This version did nothing to change my opinion.   Art and Art Design don't improve the playability of the game -- hard to read fonts and traditional fantasy images are hard to distinguish from across the table.

Better than the original Guildhall: Olde World Economy due to a better mix of card powers, more potential combos, and more flexible path to victory.

Cons: can run long with 4, card combos are pretty obvious and might become repetitive. Also, the cards are printed right to the edge and may show wear quickly.

 Very interested to move on to Alliance next!

I have been playing both the Guildhall Games enough that I can't remember which is which (and I do mix them sometimes).  Great games!  The player interaction is high and it is fun to get combos working where you can have a play that leaves others going wah?  It is a slow start for new players, but by the end of the first game, everyone seems to understand and play with confidence by the second game.  AP very possible, but a great game nonetheless.

Played once and it went really chaotic. You really have to know what each and every card does by heart. Begs for more playthroughs. For a first time run it actually went smooth in comparison with other (more demanding) games Ive played.

The cards look kinda ugly with the colors and the iconography takes some monkey-eats-banana logic to get used to but once you get it - it makes sense. 

I like this game. Will play more (Y)

Best with 2P. Excellent gateway+ strategic game for 2.

Don't ever play this with 4. Unless you want a 2 hour long game.

This collection of characters is just as good and fun as the original (Old World Economy) Guildhall set. Be patient and let the subtle combos come forth. Maybe you'll be fortunate to have your Fighters hammer out a tactical advantage, or to allow your Rangers to send over characters to opponents for extra points.

My favorite set collection game. The card design is just terrible though. From card background colors, to squished artwork, to terrible font sizes, to unaligned symbols, to useless iconography ... it's a mess. Mechanically - beautiful, tense gameplay, controllable take-that, tons of replayability by selecting different guilds -- love it. But it's so 3-wolves tshirt cringe worthy to look at ... *sigh*

Lots of replayability with three sets. A very nice mix of card powers and some great combos!  I liked the theme of the original game and wasn't sure the fantasy theme would appeal to me but the art is great and it's won me over.  My husband and grandson both love to play this with me.  It can be quite mean but luckily I have thick skin.  Need to play this set a few more times before trying the others.

I had high expectation of this game after reading the enthusiastic reviews on the previous edition of this game. But it fell flat during my first two plays. Perhaps it has to do with who I played with (wife and daughter), so may give it another try. Also, very surprised that the game failed to garner much attention after the success of the earlier edition.

I'm realizing that the things I love about Guildhall are not the things that the designer loves about Guildhall. I love setting up small combos in order to fill up my guildhall, get extra cards, extra actions, etc., by maximizing the two actions per turn. The designer seems to be treating this as a take-that game, considering the amount of attack-oriented cards so far.

I've got a bit of a history with Guildhall. I played the original Guildhall and really didn't like it because of the amount of attacks. When the expansion came out, I customized my playset to minimize the amount of attack cards (leaving just one type of attack card in the game) and then loved the game after that.

With these new sets we're back to attack city. One of the cards even lets you discard cards from someone else's guildhall without getting any benefit for yourself. That type of thing does nothing but prolong the game and cause frustration. So far I've been putting off playing the new version until I come up with a good combination of cards.

I also don't like that they didn't fix the start player advantage that existed in the original Guildhall. It's still first to 20 points wins immediately, so people who are earlier in turn order have an advantage since they can end the game earlier. You could simply play so that everyone has an equal number of turns and highest score wins, but then you would need to devise a satisfying tie-breaker rule.

So in summary I love the Guildhall system, I just don't like all of the take-that cards that just seem to prolong the game for no good reason and the start player advantage needs to be addressed. Will rate after more plays.

Better than I was expecting.  Quick to teach, easy to play.  Some interesting options as far as card combos go.  Does seem like it can end rather abruptly if one player is building a huge guildhall with large stacks of different professions, then basically turn them all in over the course of 2-3 turns to get 20 points.

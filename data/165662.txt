RATING: 7
In its deluxe wooden first edition, this is aesthetically-speaking easily the most beautiful game I own. It's a clever abstract game for two players, and as such not really of great interest for me beyond the looks. But it is a good game, and I'm sure I'll play it a lot simply because of the incredible appearance.

RATING: N/A
A simple and clean 2-player game.  Similar to Raptor with the selection of 3 numbers and keeping track of what the other player has played, but much less swingy due to no strong abilities or huge disparity in numbers chosen.

Don't feel a strong need to own it, as the wife prefers games that aren't head-to-head, but this is a good, strategic game with a good amount of depth.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite quick two player games.

The mechanics feel utterly unique.  I am sure they are not, but it feels very new to me.

There is such power in alternating the master/apprentice position every turn, but by striving to do that you are also giving that powerful flow to your opponent.

There is one rule I don't like.  The rule to make a frog noise when you play the same number.  I suggest you get a pretty polished stone, give it to one player at the beginning of the game and alternate it back and forth anytime there are doubles.  Whoever has the stone gets to place the frogs.  Tiny change, and feels completely balanced.  It has even been suggested as a fix on these forums by the designer.

Great little game for 2, put on some japanese zen music and thisgame really shines. Not that social, a lot of thinking, but relatively fast paised, it has a flow to it. Love all the different elements, there is just strategy and taktiks at so many levels of this game.

Sobre un concepto tan basico como el de las 3 en raya o el conecta 4, el señor Bruno Cathala da un nuevo giro y crea un sistema basado en prioridades y acciones diferentes (segun adoptes el rol de jardinero Jr o Sr.) que modifica totalmente el juego. Un maravilla para 2 jugadores.

What's the point to this game?  Underwhelmed and disappointed )-:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rules in the French\English are not clear on several points. 

- What are groups ? 
- Is the selected flower placed on the tile ? 
- Is the setup random (because the suggested frog placement is not symetrical) ? 
and a few other smallisch issues... 

All answers on BGG but desapointing from such a great game creator.

RATING: 6
A gentle abstrct game which I don't play nearly enough to see whether it contains stuff of fluff. In my plays to date I haven't been able to 'force' particular moves on my opponent: the whole just sort of meanders towards a certain conclusion. It all looks nice an dandy, but whether or not there's an actual game here remains to be seen. I'm a bit lenient with the rate: it can go in all directions.

[b]Rating based on - 5 plays, 2 player (2nd Edition)[/b]
I've been interested in this game ever since seeing a picture of the beautiful wooden 1st edition. I held off buying for quite a while hoping to get my hands on one but the opportunity never presented itself. FFWD to recently where I just wanted to try it already! We love Japanese themed games and games that are simple to learn but deceptively deep. This game hits both of those sweet spots. In general I suck at 'in a row' type games - Connect 4, Quarto etc. - and while I still suck at this one it kept me more interested and engaged than either of the previous two. Bidding for turn order is implemented seamlessly here and I like it much more used in this way than in Raptor or Five Tribes. I was pleasantly surprised by the rules which were clear and straightforward. The game is simple, fun, thinky, but not brain burning and quick to play. It is now my favourite Bruno Cathala game and every time I play, I find myself wanting to play more.

Ultimately I traded it away due to production quality which is low compared to regular games (although the art is lovely) and ultra-low compared to the massively over produced 1st edition. The box is way too large for the meagre components, it's also a white linen box with the cardboard showing through and no coating so I foresee it getting filthy pretty quickly. The board is adequate, but a bit thin for my liking. Two massive stickers were included in the box which must have been meant to go on the tiny player tokens so that was a production error as well.

This is a game I'd DEFinitely like to play again in the future but I'd just like a different edition. Maybe a black box edition with production values mid-way between the first and second editions - a board and tiles with a bit more heft to them, and an appropriate sized box.

[b]2nd copy[/b] gifted to me by a kind BGGer :) 

Will customise this one to my own liking with no need for the wood board. It's easy enough to do so and I'll have a unique copy. Gameplay remains the same anyway: simple but deep, thinky but fun, heaps better than Connect 4 or Quarto, and quick to play. My favourite Cathala to date.

Ok. It's a nice make-up pasted on the tic-tac-toe or 4-5 in a row abstract games.
However it suffers most of the problems other x in a row games have (except for perfect Yinsh).

But what's the most important - it is pleasant experience, very zen. Really, the theme makes sense in terms of the feeling. Nice work.
Lilly tokens are fiddly as hell.

RATING: 7
Components: ok for the game
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: light
Players: 2
Length: around 30 mins
Mechanics: pattern building to score points in the water and what to bid
Decisions: enough for this kind of game, from the numbers you have which one to bid, and where to place your flower
Opinion: interesting game, for me is better than Tash kalar (if I have to compare with another) as you have the bid phase and not so complexity with the powers of the cards.
In the end, both games are quire similar, place your pieces on the board in order to form some patterns that will score you point, but this one is prettier at sight, and makes it playable by more people

Like many Cathala games, the mechanics sound bafflingly unintuitive when explained but work better than you'd think. These didn't ever fully mesh for me, though, and I think Niya already does everything I need a quick abstract by Cathala to do. (Plus, Niya has great chunky pieces, while Haru Ichiban is, as far as I can tell, only available in digital form at this point.)

While comparably thematic for an abstract, Haru Ichiban is limited in depth and has a random factor in the simultaneous choice of gardener tiles that leaves it stuck between the chairs. It can drag and outstay its welcome by far if both players play defensively and rounds end without points or repeatedly a single point for a player.

Haru Ichiban is a light strategy game similar to Connect Four but with a changing landscape.  Each player has three flowers (numbers face down) in front of them (more are set aside to draw from on future turns).  Each player secretly reviews their flowers and plays one (they're number 1-8).

Each lilly pad is double-sided (light side & dark side).  Only one dark lilly pad is available each turn to place a flower on.  Whoever placed the higher number is the senior gardener that turn with the lower number being the junior gardener.  The junior gardener has to place their flower they just played on the dark lilly pad.  The senior gardener then places their flower anywhere.  The junior gardener then moves a lilly pad one space.  If there is one or more immediately in front of that, they all move with the one you're moving.  Finally, the senior gardener flips one empty lilly pad to its dark side.  

Points are earned by having placed four flowers all adjacent to each other to form a square or by placing them in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal). A row of five is an automatic victory.  The game plays VERY quickly and has a nice Japanese pond, calming theme to it.  In short, it's a winner.

. une boîte trop encombrante pour le matériel proposé.

Társasjátékok Ünnepén próbáltam ki, és jobban tetszett, mint amire számítottam. Rögtön visszavágót is játszottunk (aztán meg is vettem..).
Gyönyörű a játék, és a téma is érdekes, megnyugtató, ami csökkenti a játék absztrakt érzetét. Pedig igazából ez egy bonyolított amőba, de pont attól lesz jó, amivel több! A licit az elején sajnos minimálisan szerencsefüggő (ha pl csak nagy lapod van, nem sok a választási lehetőség), de nagyon érdekes, és egyben a sorrendet + a végrehajtható akciókat is eldönti. Ez a játék sava borsa, és talán legizgalmasabb döntési helyzete. Szeretem az olyan játékokat, ahol ki kell találnom az ellenfelem gondolatait, és az alapján lépnem. A brekegős rész lóg ki csak kicsit, de ez is inkább egy különlegesség, ami kiragadja a hétköznapi absztraktok sorából.
Óriási pozitívum, hogy könnyed játék. A tavirózsák mozgatása viszont kissé körülményes, de ennyi talán belefér.

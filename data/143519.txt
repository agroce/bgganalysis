[i]tl;dr - Distills that 4X space feel into just an hour; Quantum is a tactical dice placement and maneuvering game that will give you the thrill of beating down your opponents to gain superiority in the galaxy![/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Quantum is a semi-abstract dice placement game that distills a 4X (kind of, there is technically no Exploration) down to its very bones. You command a civilization that is attempting to plant 'quantum cubes' (we just call them colonies) on planets in a map, by traveling the stars in your spaceships -- which are dice! A lower die will be much more powerful but move slowly, while a higher die will be fast and weak. By orbiting planets, you can lay quantum cubes -- first to lay all their cubes wins!

This game is perhaps the best tactical war game I have in my collection. I absolutely love what they've done with the variable dice and the plotting and planning to take down your opponent(s) fleets is one of my favorite gaming experiences. In 3-4 player counts, the game can go long, but 2 player is a perfectly tactical slugging adventure! 

The command cards can be unbalanced as they essentially break the game, but when everyone can have up to three, [I]you have only yourself to blame if your opponent is stocking up on cards and you are doing nothing.[/I] The cards provide a slight engine-building feel to the game because you will likely have at least a ship or two added to your fleet by the end of the game, as well as unique special abilities that you can harness to outwit your opponents and drop cubes. 

The core question is "Are the dice too random to make this a good game?" I have to say, no. The game is great, and though there is a single initial roll when you determine your ship values, everything else is in your hands. I love the revaluation aspect and how more powerful ships are slower. There's a lot of bluffing and second-guessing that goes on in two-player games.

I love this game! Some say it's pretty abstract and the theme is "pasted on" but I totally buy into it. Dice are ships and depending on which face is showing determines the type of ship and its abilities. Having the fastest ship - a 6 - is great for moving 6 spaces but not so great for attacking other ships. It's a very clever and fun game. I like it a lot.

Nice ideas, attractive, well themed, and easy to learn. But downtime is a significant issue as the game offers so many options - AP is a problem. It is deeply conflict-driven and hence very swingy with a lot of randomness in the dice rolls. Once a run-away leader is established, there's no catching them. The basic mechanics look great at first appearance but there are problems with the design.

- Keeping track of your actions is a bit fiddly. We use two types of markers (not included in the game) for this purpose - one type for keeping track of the actions, and another type for keeping track of the special abilities of the ships.

+ Creating a cool combination of actions and abilities culminating in a crazy turn is a deeply enjoyable experience; Playing in teams makes the four-player game really work for us.
- It can be hard to keep track of which ships moved and which ships already used their special abilities on top of how many actions have been taken.

Very clever and elegant dice game combined with area control. 
Basically it is an thematic abstract game and I like the artwork! 
Each die value has multiple meanings: type of ship, travel distance, and combat value. 
The special powers combined allow great and interesting combos.

really a pretty great design. I'm not sure how well it will hold up in terms of desire to play in the long term but my first play was a blast and came right down to the wire. Combat is quick and fun and without much sting associated with the loss (compare to a game like eclipse or TI where losing a huge battle means you may feel like you just got physically stomped). The only problem I have with this is the price point. The components are nice, but you could easily play (90% of) this game with a set of dice and some playing cards, playing MSRP for what you get is borderline robbery.

Unfortunately suffers from runaway leader and extreme randomness, due to often game-deciding one-die combat.  It's an okay game, but it left me feeling very unsatisfied and not really in control of my actions.

Cant beat a space empire game that can be played quickly! Less than 1 hour possible! Awesome!

Like Space Chess with multiple players. Very thoughtful turns and combos in order to maximize your effectiveness.

I just wish these ships were miniatures instead of die. Perhaps put the die in a miniature mold around it like Burning Suns!

The theme and the game play do not really agree and this can be seen from the moment you open the box. The game is quite backstabby (like) while the graphics are minimal (dislike) and the components are good quality (like) but rather simplistic. The game has quite some strategy indide, but I could see while playing the first time that there's a case when the game never ends or it ends very slowly, depending of the aggressiveness of the players. It is quite a no go for me, but the game is not bad. In the same category I prefer Alien Frontiers, even though I am not a fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much greater than the sum of its parts. You will be drawn into the theme. Lots of opportunities for clever moves and thinking outside the box. A really simple set of rules that provide a lot of game for being so easy to teach. Luck does play a significant role.

Update:
Seeing some potential for a runaway leader problem in 2 player game. This takes it down a couple notches for me. Will have to see how frequent this is or if it is improved at a higher player count. It also seems in a 2 player game the first several rounds are somewhat scripted. 

The art and components are good and the table presence is excellent, adding to the game play and overall vibe.

The game is a brain-burner for sure. Lots of options are available and in a setting as chaotic as 4p, an ideal move is always hard to find. I love the fact that everyone can specialize in a certain play style as long as a good combination of advance cards are available to them.

The only negative I can think of is, with a combination of AP players and a tight, combat oriented map, the game can drag on as options available to place a cube slowly start disappearing. Our first game took 3 hours to finish but I blame the 3x3 grid being too tight for 4 players.

Edit1 - After 15 plays, I don't think this game will get a rating higher than 8 from me. It's definitely an amazing game with lots of replayability. The downside is, in 1 out of every 3 game I've played, one player got an advance card combo that was unstoppable by all the other players combined. Maybe it was our mistake that the game state became this one sided, but the fact that there was nothing to do but watch the other player slowly get a victory made the game unpleasant at times. Hence, 8 is ideal for Quantum, a solid, elegant game but not without flaws.

We often think so many people think that in order for a board game to be good it has to be deep and complex. Quantum is neither of those things and it is quick to become one of our favorites. Love the dice as ships. Mind you any game with dice is a plus for us. Easy game play and variable difficulty. If you want a fun game then Quantum is where it's at.

Juego con temática espacial, aunque al final es un abstracto claramente.

Es rápido y ágil, pero al final se trata de buscar combinaciones numéricas con las naves que tienes para poner unos cubos en los planetas a través de unas naves que tienen propiedades especiales y que pueden mutar su valor.

Hay un pequeño factor de azar en los combates, aunque hay mecánicas que me chirriaron un poco. No comprendo porque el atacante tiene clara ventaja en los combates y algunas otras pequeñas reglas poco intuitivas.

Por lo demás, para ser meramente abstracto (con lo poco que me gustan) pasé un rato entretenido, gracias al cierto factor azar de los combates, y a que además tiene cartas para dar variabilidad a la partida. Tiempo de juego muy ajustado y admite varios jugadores sin problema.

De todos modos, no sería un juego que me compraría porque no es mi estilo para nada. Con los abstractos me cuesta meterme en la temática, aunque este no es tan quemacerebros como otros.

I like Quantum. The game is essentially an abstract, masquerading as a more theme heavy game. I would recommend it, but only at about half of the list price. 

Unfortunately, it does have two big balancing issues that anyone interested in purchasing this title should be aware of.
1. Of particular note are the command cards titled "brilliant" and "precocious;" and to a lesser extent "cerebral" and "plundering." Each card on its own is enough to completely throw off the balance of the game. It's best to just look at this as an element of potential asymmetry. Alternatively, the cards can simply be removed for a more balanced experience.
2. Turn order provides an extreme advantage to the first player, while nearly insuring that the last player will lose the game. The map fix provided below will help with this issue, but will not solve it.

Most of the in game map designs are nonfunctional- they're all too large. I generally build my own using the following equation: Number of players, times one less the number of quantum cubes in play, plus one, equals the number of quantum cube slots in play. So a game with four players and five quantum cubes would require enough room for 17 quantum cubes[the math: ((4x(5-1)+1=17]. This creates a situation where players have to compete in order to place their quantum cubes, and thereby reduces the impact of turn order.

In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move. The board itself is made out of modular tiles, and you can play on one of the 30 layouts that come with the game or design your own. The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.

This is a REALLY well designed game. Each turn feels interesting and chess like, pushing how far you can go with your few actions. The game is pretty dry though.

Quantum is a clever game, quite peculiar and indeed different to any other.

Dice are used as ships, and the number shown on the upper side defines speed, combat strength (lower is better!) and a special power for each ship.

The goal is placing quantum cubes, via combat or orbital control.

There are special power cards, breaking the rules in various ways, that contribute to variety (as well as a huge number of scenarios).

The game is very tactical in nature, and each player must figure out what to do in his turn. So a it could be quite AP prone, and end up in oversatying its welcome.
Need to play it more to find if it is the case.

Anyway, an unusual game and I'd like to play it again.

3x space game that plays fast and light but also very strategic/tactical. Pulling off combos and surprise wins is so satisfying. Luck with dice rolls but makes for an exciting/unpredictable game. I think this will become a classic and will see the table way more than Eclipse due to time.

Still, there isn't much pulling me to play the game very often.

I love this game. For one, it has a space theme which always scores points with me.

I know companies like Cool Mini or Not make awesome miniatures to pack in with their games and yes it does add to the theme sometimes, but because there are no miniatures involved in this game I get an awesome space game with lots of replay value for under $40.

«Hey, Nic, wanna play»?
«What is it»?
«A game with dice and starships».
«Definitely»!
And so it began...

There are starships, that’s true.
There are dice, that’s also true.
But they forgot to tell me the dice are the starships.
Which, several degrees of simplification later, means Quantum is nothing more than an absurdly complex abstract game with a pasted-on science fiction theme, one among a hundred that would fit.

As an abstract, it works. But as an abstract, it also relies on endless overthinking, developing a lasting strategy to stick to and exploiting every single rule: all of this at the cost of having fun and making illogical but daring moves not only dangerous but also counterproductive.
You can’t just try and see what happens: as soon as you do it you abdicate any chance and rights at winning.

And there’s no reason to play such an annoying game that forbids taking risks and all the fun resulting from it.

I don't mind RnG, but if you do mind, do not play this game.  The game offers a neat puzzle, but I did not like the combat in this game.  Attacking seems to over powered since there is zero risk for doing so.  I like at least having to worry about my attack not being successful.

4p also seems very chaotic, where a player can get into a bad situation by no decision they made.  Have not played 2p, but I would like to try it to see how it differs.

Maybe I need to play it again, but i don't want to as I hated it - wish it had elimination so I could walk away ...

Probably was mis-sold it. Wasn't told it was an abstract with lots of randomness from the dice and cards, with chunks of AP downtime while you contemplate your moves. All fine in a 2 player, hmm, except the randomness.

No, I was told it was a cool 4x game ... Didn't work for me. No build up, just fly your dice around and try to put cubes on the map to win, and good luck doing that in a multiplayer.

Ugh, never again (and I haven't even mentioned the weirdly unpleasant sticky dice)

RATING: 8.5
This is a nice and tight tactical space game.
The special features of the ships (Dice) and the cards gives this abstract game enough flavour and theme.
It plays fast and short. You have to watch out the moves of your opponents and outmanouver them to succeed. As the run for quantum cubes is so tight, every action counts.
Very elegant slick designed game.

Fun little game with some clever ideas and options. However not sure of long term appeal. Has elements which are present in a lot of these sort of light combat games: Large amounts of luck as with any dice game, kingmaking issues and difficulty in control over your destiny. Components are solid, the dice do work as ships but would have been nicer if they had found a way to put a number on a plastic ship instead.

RATING: 8
Very good lite 4X strategy game. Quick, easy to pick up, enough rng to help new players but enough depth to reward skill. Extensive variation as well in different map types, different abilities, etc. Not good with 2 players.

In addition to the dice ship combat, there are also permanent upgrades. Part of the fun of this game is creating a unique build. Some of the builds can be OP, which can be a problem since you get upgrades when you get quantum cubes (VPs). However, in 3 or 4 player matches, the losing players will frequently team up against the winning player, adding a cool social dynamic. However, 2 player games fail because the leader is able to snowball.

Despite it's simplicity, every game we've played of quantum, someone's had an amazing strategy. Once time a friend of mine got 3 cubes (VPs) out of 6 in one turn, something I had never seen anyone do. Another time, when where playing a heavily diagonal map, a different friend of mine invested in ships which could move diagonally then got two abilities: one which allowed him to take an extra movement action if he didn't attack, another which allowed him to move the same ship twice. The rest of us, focused on combat, didn't even notice his strategy until it was too late. He zipped around the map stealing planets before we had the time to react. He won, but not because he was the first to an OP combo, but because he was smart enough to use the map and our combat focused builds to his advantage.

RATING: 8
Great, fun, light but challenging game. The possibilities afforded by the dice provide some really interesting tactical combos, and the various card benefits/abilities make each game an interesting, unique experience. Some games can be very non-confrontational, as each player simply races to get cubes out on the board as fast as possible. Other games can be slaughter-filled fight fests, with dominance playing a key role in the placement of cubes. I'd love to see an expansion with more cards or additional special dice to expand gameplay even more. Love it!

RATING: N/A
Fun for the first couple of plays, but once you've seen all the special combos you can do with the ships there isn't a lot of depth to it. The cards are unbalanced, some are way overpowered, others are nearly useless. The end game tends to degenerate into a state where everybody would win with the next cube they place, so it's a matter of everybody stopping the next player who could pop out another cube. The winner more often than not being the one who has more luck with the dice, or manages to grab all the cards that give extra ships and snowball to victory.

Quantum's beautiful illustrations lured me into what ultimately felt like a pretty abstract game to me.  I guess almost any game, once the theme is stripped, is an abstract game at heart, but for whatever reason, this game felt even more so to me.

I generally hate games that feel this way, but Quantum is actually pretty good regardless.  There is a lot of room for clever maneuvering, along with a good dose of luck to keep it fun.  The game also feels a bit "different", with it's abstract core surrounded by theme and beautiful graphics.

Overall, it's definitely in the like-it-but-don't-love-it category for me.

RATING: 8
A clever, sleek game. Everything about Quantum feels minimalist, from the design to the art (which some may find too abstract, but I adore) to the playtime.

Honestly, this doesn't feel much like a 4x game to me. There's no real sense of growing your empire (or... even having one?). Fans of the genre might be better served elsewhere. But this is really my cup of tea: nice medium weight game with simple rules and lots of fun options.

I love games like this that reward attacking, and this one does it particularly well as it also helps mitigate some of the luck in the game. Don't have the right ships to get a VP on the map? Attack someone instead! And the beginner 4 person map is setup so that it's very likely that everyone will be in that situation at some point, making combat even more relevant. All in all just excellent design.

I love the cards, too. Not only will they add nice variety for replay value, EVERY one feels worth having and it always feels devastating when an opponent takes one. Very, very cool.

My only complaint is the game feels a little overbalanced. Most games tend to end with all players tied at 5, each trying to race to the last VP so the endgame gets pretty drawn out as everyone spends their turns trying to prevent the next person in line from winning. In two player games this can actually be tense and exciting, but with 3-4 players it can lead to kingmaking.

But honestly with such a short playtime and so much fun pre-endgame this game is absolutely worth having, playing, and playing again.

Small component issue (it's largely just aesthetic) but none of my dice are perfectly flat on all sides. Hopefully will be addressed in future printings.

Yet a somewhat forgettable game… We did play with 4, which I think is the best number due to the increased amount of conflicts etc., but that couldn’t save the game from being poor. The luck of the dice is significant, and although you can mitigate the luck, you can still be screwed badly. And it seemed hard to win if you lose a couple of crucial battles early on as you need to spend an action on getting back the die – and the winner was the player who didn’t participate in a lot of combats until the end. The worst part of the game is probably the cards though. While I’m a sucker for special player powers, I hate when the various powers are noticeable different in their usefulness and strength… We all agreed that they could have been better balanced. The game only took an hour, and I think it might take even less with further plays. While I’m willing to try it again a couple of times if people insist, it’s not something I would suggest myself.

I'm really glad I was able to track this one down and not sure why I held off for so long.

+ Promo : Quantum: The Void (2013)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quantum was a game which enticed me with what appeared to be a novel way to use dice. Upon playing the game I found that yes indeed, the game does use a new trick: dice double as war ships, with the number of pips indicating both type and range; and because it's all quantum, can be reconfigured on a whim by simply rolling the die. Combat however is still the ubiquitous d6 + modifier comparison, nothing new there... although it is now the lowest total which wins, which is refreshing too. The result is a very fluid and tactical game; in addition the fact that equal dice rolls in combat hand victory to the attacker means that it is a very aggressive game too. The game profits noticably from this idea. There are very few positive feedback loops too, meaning that it is hard for one player to simply start winning and keep on winning.

I'm usually not in the mood for this type of game, but it has been a wish to augment my collection with one semi-brainless game of quick dice aggression. Nexus Ops would have fit the bill (and perhaps it still does), but it's hard to get hold of nowadays (in the old edition of course), and the idea of hidden assignments doesn't sit well with me. Quantum knows no such thing, keeping everybody focussed on the same goal. We'll see if the game will be able to meet my expectations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quantum is an interesting game which is good but not great. It definitely takes several plays to start seeing strategy and clever tactics, but they are there - the destroyers (warp/switch places special ability) in particular open a variety of interesting moves.

Ultimately Quantum suffers not because it's a bad game but because there are almost always other better games we prefer to play instead.

Fairly quick fun. I liked the pivot from "yeah, we're just claiming territory" to "fighting tooth and nail to get those last 1-2 cubes on the board".

Only downside: it eventually got to the point of "each player tries to keep the next one from winning", which I'm less fond of. (Though the "can they win?"-figuring was sometimes complex enough that even gentle time constraints might well have stopped it from being a problem.)

Interesting game with interesting mechanisms is intersting (duh!).
While i initially thought i'd be a bit overwhelemd by all of the stuff that is going on with the modular board, the dice, the special cards and all that stuff...   the game actually plays very smoothly one you get into it.
I found it interesting (yeah, sorry...  my brain is lazy today) and it certainly felt like a game I could have fun exploring further.
On the other hand it also reminded me why I'm not all that interested in multiplayer games with a higth level of conflict as the way players interact and essentially negotiate seems to have a greate rimpact on the outcome of the game than actual skill and strategy ( i won the game despite being a bit clueless about what i was doing, playing it for the first time... the other players just didn't pay enough attention to what i was doing and which cards i had... )

Dice combat based area control game boiled down to the bare essentials. Yes there's technology cards and six different ship configurations but because the board movement is rather simple, the ships are just variations of moving around it for area majority. The fact that ships are dice is a neat concept but I'd rather have ship miniatures instead. Difficult to catch up when you fall behind. Ship configurations are random.

A good strategy / war game. It has some RNG elements (i.e. dice rolling for combat) but there are fewer upsets than in certain other games (*cough* Risk *cough*).

The space theme is nice. The player boards have nice artwork / design. The components are high quality and the reconfigurable board tiles allow for many unique scenarios. The game mechanics are enjoyable and feel fairly balanced. Some of the cards are certainly better than others, but not by a huge enough margin to cause issues.

It's very easy to measure victory progress, so there are very rarely surprise endings unless someone unexpectedly can somehow manage to drop 3 cubes in one turn. When people are down to 1-2 cubes each you know the end is imminent, unlike in some other games.

Nice twist on the dice as action selectors, with the dice themselves becoming ships that move around the board and fight. Yes, fight! Using other dice, even! There's tech, too! I'm surprised the normally combat-averse euro crowd has generally accepted this game, but pleasantly so.

Though I'm still always going to prefer a more Ameritrashy approach to space combat games, the multiple, integrated ways in which the dice are used is very impressive to me from a design perspective. This is possibly one of the most efficient designs I've ever seen.

Anyway, a good game, and something I might be willing to play from time to time with my euro crowd.

Pulls back some, as I haven't gotten it to the table much lately, but still a wonderful, under-rated game.

[February 2015 - 9.7]
I'll repeat it. Quantum gets better with every play, hence jumping up to the top of my rankings. There are so many possibilities and I'm finding new ways to win -- especially on the crucial final cube as everyone is scrambling. Also, there's a game within a game of hiding your intentions so others don't come in for the attack before you settle. It's like your mind expands and sees the board in a whole new light with moves you never knew existed. Okay, maybe that was too deep, but those "ah-ha" or "lightbulb" moments really make the game. There are even times when I've played this game and we're all looking at every player's turn as a puzzle to determine what their best move is, even though that move might hurt the rest of us.

[November 2014 - 9]
Quantum gets better with every play. It starts out very simple and there's always an obvious move for you to do, but take a second look, be a little more familiar with the dice actions and abilities, and then you see a better second option, or an even better third option for your move. It's brilliantly balanced (fast and weak ships or slow and strong ones) and a pleasure to look at. (A shame that they had problems with the sticky and poorly painted dice -- I used Goo-be-Gone to clean mine, and the publishers are promising to send new dice.) Don't let that detract you. This is a great game that deserves more attention. The more you play it the more you'll realize its brilliance. Some people complain about the luck of the dice rolls, but every ship really can be used to your advantage and it's not a terribly long game (30 mins for two-players) to where you feel cheated if you lose the game because of an unlucky streak. One thing I've learned about this game is that they really want to encourage you to attack -- there's little penalty for doing so, a lot of upside with "dominance," points and it prevents everyone from just going to their own corners of the board and settling.

A simple space conquest game with some really neat mechanic, this is a very nice, mid-weight game that nonetheless has a good decision space. Don't let the dice fool you: while there might be a certain amount of luck, it is not that luck driven. There are several mechanics that can help mitigate the luck. However, depending on the map, expect a certain amount of combat.

All plays on BoardGameArena. I like the game a lot; the way the command card powers work, the way the dice special powers relate, the way the game implements a back-and-forth without being interminable...

I'm not sure if I'll be playing it much more online, though. And I have a few concerns that keep it from being a must-buy (it's still on my wishlist). Firstly: card powers are a strong positive feedback loop. This makes the game much less suitable with two -I'm not sure why this is listed as recommended on the BGG page. This is generally fine with 3 or 4 players, though, which are much better numbers. Bash the leader/crabs in bucket gameplay works well for making the game tense and workable.

The problem with online play is that your average opponents don't grasp this aspect of the game, and the matchmaking system appears to reward players who place more quantum cubs with higher ratings. So positive feedback happens and the game becomes slightly boring. This will probably be fine in person, though.

My other gripes are the lack of action/ship ability trackers and card opacity. Figuring out optimal sequences online is a bit difficult, but I can't imagine having to work with take-backs and playing through several sequences without any record of what happened. And some cards definitely fall in the more/less balanced sides of the scales, and sometimes it's not obvious which is which (decrease dominance for research is VERY weak, and the self-destruct one doesn't really make much sense until you see a good player use it against you). This makes the game more prone to outside-the-game optimization, which is probably not what you want for this sort of a game.

Still, it's pretty good! Don't let this keep you from enjoying it or anything!

Short, streamlined puzzley game about moving dice around eat other dice and placing cubes. Its themed on space conquest but doesn't really generate this in anymore than name. It does however feel quite clever. I liked it enough to play it again but its not an epic by any stretch.

Enjoyed this game as much as I think I would enjoy a game where a major factor is dice rolling. The most satisfying thing about this game is that there is a puzzle solving element to this game. There are a number of ways to win but again a lot of it has to do with the luck of the roll. My win was decided by one dice roll which came with a 5/6 chance of failure. Somehow I was just able to pull it off. There's some interesting dynamics to this game, but if I had to choose whether to own it, I'd probably opt for another game.

Quantum is... A masterpiece! This game is exceptionally designed: every mechanic is tight and intuitive. Stellar (if simple) components and production. Highly interactive (if you're okay with cutthroat aggression). Huge decision space and infinitely replayable. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played.

Really works for me. Looks abstract at first sight, but you really transition from dices to ships during the play... and there is so many cool moves to make to thwart your opponents! I also found the game to be really well balanced (over 3 games so far): even though some player may seem to get ahead at some point, the end games have always been pretty close and suspenseful.

This is solid little war game that is built clean with some nice components, art, and chunky dice. For me, I found the need to refer dice pips to a reference sheet for the ships effect annoying, since it is hard to really see what is happening on the board... though for the mechanics to work I understand why it is the way it is. Another gripe is with games that don't have equal turns (without some player order catch up mechanic), as the first player can win having an extra turn over the other players (I say this having won the game as the last player).

For those who like this style of game it is worth owning. For me, one play is enough.

4 player entry-level to medium game that involves using dice to build space colonies and battle with other players.  Each of the numbers on the dice represent different abilities with lower numbers generally better.  There's some luck with the dice rolling and the game is designed/balanced to keep everyone pretty close so no one really can run away and win easily.  Certainly a unique game that anyone can jump in and play that doesn't take too long either.

This game was a lot cleverer than I expected. Your dice are space ships that move and fight according to their number, but the catch is that lower dies win battles. So that 6 that can fly around the board? He’s really vulnerable so keep him away from stuff. Then on top of those decisions there are bonus powers you purchase to create some crazy power combos. 

We played a game and then immediately wanted to play another now that we knew what we were doing. The different map configurations force different strategies from game to game. 

It’s not in my wheelhouse for games, but I like it and will play it on occasion with no need to own.

Quantum is a fantastic and very well-balanced, abstract strategy game.

Having the dice as both the player’s ship types and combat values makes this game very intuitive to pick up and play quickly.  The simplicity of the mechanics doesn't make this by any means a game for dullards and while it has the potential to be very thinky, it's not a brain-burner.

The real joy in this game comes from chaining ships special abilities and advance cards; just when you think all is lost you can come up with amazing combos that pull you back in the game.  Also this game can be made even better if you go into space politics amongst the table.

For the larger maps I suggest playing for the more densely packed  maps as any isolated ends slow down the game considerably at the start and make the game far less cut-throat than it should be with multiple players.

While the game is not completely abstract, the loose nature of the game’s mechanics means Quantum is not just a game for sci-fi nerds.

Hi boys,
got my copy of Quantum today, was to late for the kickstarter but got it now from my favourite game shop. Unfortunately the dice have a really bad quality, it seems there is a "cohesiv or oil film" on it, which make the dice unusable. Think it will damage the components inside if I don't seperate the dice from the other components.
Now I researched and found out that there seems a problem with that dice from production?
I need a replacement. And of course I could send the worse dice back to you because otherwise I will throw them away. Looking forward for your reply about this issue.
Best regards,
Michael    sent to funforge by today - march 26 - 2015

May 31st still no reply from funforge, after my second reminder at their website! Poor quality, poor customer service... 

Set up a game rating "1" related to their poor customer service. Let's see if I could generate with such an "effort" at least a reaction from funforge...

This is a phenomenal game, I like it very much!
Have played it mainly as 2 player so far.

It is a *very* strategic game, but rules are fairly simple to teach. Lots of replay value given the different map configurations.
Some cards seem a tad overpowered. Or at least they can be unbalanced. But they also add to the replay value, and I would not say that they are broken in any way.

A shame that there aren't any expansions of this game, and that it seems it has not caught as much attention as it deserves (no review by Tom Vasel, etc) :-(

This is an instant 9 which has a high probability of wave-collapsing into a 10 with further plays. My favorite theme coupled with one of my favorite mechanics: dice used for activation and display, as well as for traditional random number generation. In fact, the abundance of dice here is deceptive, as in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/73439/troyes]Troyes[/url], another favorite of mine: luck plays a much lesser role than optics suggests, and between ship powers and command cards there are innumerable ways to mitigate risk. It is an aggressive game which wants to see the players fighting; however, their investment in their ships being no bigger than a chess player's in his pawns, there is no bad blood. I would even argue that this space empire-building abstract game is [i]less[/i] agressive than chess, because your pieces can always come back to the board, reconfigured. And the way the empires differentiate themselves acquiring gambit and command cards throughout the game is lovely. Perhaps the best description [url=https://vimeo.com/88242171]was given[/url] by the boys from the Shut Up & Sit Down show: Quantum is a "marvel of miniaturization", a 15-minute per player 3.5X epic with all the thrill of battle and technological advancement of much longer and wonkier games. A very beautiful game, in more than one sense.

Sometimes you get a feeling a game was just made for you. Quantum is one of those games for me. It all works perfectly.
Its easy to explain, plays quick, offers a good deal of variety and I love the theme. It also works well from 2-4 players.
You feel quite clever when you find an effective way to combo your ships. Also, picking the best advance cards with strong synergy is incredibly powerful.
I love the player boards for this game as well. They keep everything neat and tidy while giving you all the info you need to play.

Nagyon tetszett benne egy csomó minden: a hajók, mint dobókockák, a sok spéci hajóképesség, a harc támogatása, a játékidő, a fejlesztéskártyák. A legjobb talán az, hogy az egész teljesen egyedi, mind mechanikában, mind hangulatban.

De mindez teljesen háttérbe szorult, mert a kockadobásoknak túl nagy a súlya, ahhoz képest, hogy gyakorlatilag semmivel se tudod befolyásolni/enyhíteni a hatásukat. Hatalmas érvágás folyamatosan hajókat veszíteni, emiatt marhára nem mindegy, hogy hogy alakulnak a csaták. Az se mindegy, hogy milyen hajót kapsz vissza a szerelőműhelyből, de ez is full lutri. A hatalmas szerencseszerep nekem nagyon lehúzta a játékélményt. 
Mindezek tetejébe még olló problémával is küzd. Mivel ha sikerül több bolygót foglalnod, akkor jobb pozícióból indíthatod a hajóidat, ráadásul több fejlesztéskártyád is lesz, ami szintén nagy előny. Emiatt nehéz behozni a játék elején egy.két rossz dobás miatt beszedett hátrányt, ami még fájdalmasabbá teszi a szerencseszerepet.

A 4X space game in a fairly tight package which has pretty much all of the qualities of a "proper" 4X game except for an overlong playing time.

As such, if you're predisposed to like games like that chances are pretty good you'll find something to like here, too. There are some interesting twists and the various ship abilities allow for some clever moves. Add lots of different research cards and some variability in the map setup, and it's one of the 4X games I'm most likely to play willingly.

====

Quantum is a game that was very popular around here last year, but's it's fallen a bit as other games have become more popular. That said, the game is a good time and plays a little faster with 2p than 3p, but three is what I prefer.

[2015.06.01]

This game has dropped drastically for me.  However, before I explain why let me confess that I am not a good player, so my rating is inevitably colored by that fact.  Additionally, my view of Quantum has changed quite drastically since I played Eclipse, which is vaguely comparable, but a far superior game in every possible way (save for duration).  That said, I REALLY wanted to love Quantum, but there are a few things that work against it.  First, there is often not enough time in the game to formulate and execute a plan.  The game is almost entirely tactical as written.  Likewise, even in the course of working towards a goal, games can (and do, very often) hinge on a single decision or die roll.  You can sometimes get away with a wasted action, but rarely can you get away with two.  Playing against beginners is more forgiving of course, but I played against serious players who knew the cards and combos inside out and a wasted move was usually death.  Add in dice, and maybe you see my dilemma.  Finally, the cards are a bit imbalanced and some combos are clearly unstoppable.  I have less of a problem with this than the other points.  In the end, the game fell flat with me and I decided to trade it away.

[2015.04.01] 7.75

This is a good game, however it's of the nature that until your get a feel for the available combos it'll always seem like your opponents have better rolls, move further, construct more easily, etc.  Hang in there because there is a good game here.

I like Quantum's main thrust: that different ships (die sides) have different special abilities. Otherwise, this is a standard movement, area control game with simple attacking with dice numbers (nothing new). As with many games like this, there are cards as well to "break" the rules of the game and offer special one-time bonuses. In the end, I liked it. I would play it again, but it didn't really thrill me. "Reconfiguring" (or rerolling) your ships to change them is a crap shoot (pun intended) and you can spend a few turns trying to get the right dice in order to settle on planets. Yes, there are cards that will help (and 4-ships that can turn into a '3' or '5') but the luck is still there (which isn't always bad). At least once the system is understood, turns go by quick enough! So overall, it's a good game with not enough new or innovative things to make it truly special.

And why are the dice so sticky?!

Space theme doesn't interest me at all. I don't much like being attacked in games, nor attacking, but it would be silly and futile to play otherwise in this game.

Appears very constricted. Very abstract, almost themeless space game, with dice as ships that can constantly reconfigure. Interesting idea, but a bit silly, in my book, but then I'm more interested in a richer, well implemented theme. I like my abstracts as solid abstracts (if that makes sense). Still, going to give it a chance, though.

First off, why are the dice sticky? That was weird. The game didn't do anything for me, not at all.

Also, did I mention the dice were sticky?

RATING: 7
An interesting and elegant way to re-purpose D6s into spaceships. If you're expecting a proper 4X game something like a light version of Eclipse then you're barking up the wrong tree. At heart it's a game of strategic positioning. Combat is swift and brutal. The only real downside is some of the abilities you can buy are obviously better than the others so it can be a bit swingy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another really nice and STREAMLINED 4x space game. This uses a very simple set of components (dice, cards, tiles...that's basically it!) and sets up and plays fast...MOST of the time. What I mean, is that the goal to win is to place all 5 of your cubes down. Cubes 1-3 go by really quick, it's essentially the final two that take a while as the map gets crowded. This can often lead to a king-making/uber-blocking/somewhat frustrating experience...particularly if the two dominant players spend so many turns blocking each other, that another player jumps in and takes the win. :(
Quite a fun and simple to teach/understand game though. Beautiful components.
Some wishes for an expansion: asymmetrical player abilities based on their species, a decent/more common way to eliminate other players cubes from planets. Perhaps more diplomatic card abilities offering protection? Those would probably make things more interesting.

I've played a lot of Quantum with my friends over the course of many late, late nights. It's a game that's adept at making you feel very smart when you win and very stupid when you don't. However, the better we've gotten at the game the more the kingmaking centric endgame has started to show. I'll probably enjoy it more when I've gotten some space from it, but this aspect of the game makes it much less strategic than I wanted it to be.

Great conquest game, especially 4 player.

The way ships work and interact allows for a lot of strategy. Battles have just the right amount of luck. You generally have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen when you attack another ship, but the occasional surprise keeps things interesting and means you always need a backup plan.

The deck of abilities also creates a great variety of play since different abilities will come up each game. Some combine very well with each other and some do a great job of countering each other.

Some map configurations are definitely more fun than others.

The game is rather self balancing, especially 4 player. Unfortunately when playing 2 player, rolling the right ships on the right maps seems like it can really impact who wins. This is less of an issue on some maps.

EDIT: On further plays, the game has a serious issue with "kingmaking" when playing with 3 or 4 players.

Quantum is absolutely worth your time. Quantum is and isn't many things. Quantum isn't a 4x-lite. Quantum is a clever dice driven abstract drenched in space.

RATING: 10
Update: the more I play this game, the more I like it! I flippin' love this game!

I initially felt this to be an abstract, with an empire-building premise. However, when I play, I find that it has enough theme for me to feel like I'm moving ships around, at the same time as being aware that it's abstract. In keeping with the name, it's in two states at once - highly abstract, yet also thematic.

Don't get me wrong - not everyone will find that this game has enough theme. I admit that I don't personally need very much to engage with a theme; my imagination does the rest. In fact, I often find too much detail detracts from the theme, as I very quickly notice the stuff that doesn't make sense or conflicts with what I want from the theme. So for me, Quantum is thematic enough, as it leaves wiggle room for me to imagine the details.

This game is only going to improve with future plays, as we learn clever things to do with the dice (my partner is already using the flagships to piggyback other ships around; I was doing fancy things with changing the dice values).

I'm impressed that the different layouts encourage different styles of play, too, so you're less likely to get tired of playing the same opponent.

It's difficult to find a game that I like, and that I will be able to actually play (either due to my friends actually wanting to play it, or due to play time). Quantum seems to fill that niche for me.

I'll end with what another BGG user said about the game. He or she remarked that this was the game they would have designed themselves, if they had the ability to do so. I say the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Flawed but kind of brilliant. The brilliance is in how the game constantly makes little puzzles for you to solve-- you spend minutes staring at the board working your move out in your head, and then inspiration hits. This is fun!

Flaws: Die rolls for combat, rewards for picking on weak players, draftable cards of wildly varying usefulness, can easily bog down.

Also note: Some maps are more fun than others. The intro map is barely worth playing.

RATING: 7
I'm very divided on this one - on the one hand, it's somewhat addictive to me, and I love a lot of the concepts in it - it really feels like a dice game with real strategy. But on the other hand, it seems to have significant problems. The 2 player game has far too much empty space and it's far too difficult to affect the other player. The 3 player game is the most fun, but it has balance issues which tend to make it feel like the winner only won because the player before them made a mistake. The 4 player game is almost as fun and doesn't have the balance issues, but the down time is just too high for a fun, quick dice game. On top of those things, it doesn't feel like the cards are always as balanced as they should be.

Quantum is an interesting 4x game conceived as an abstract strategy game. Dice function as ships as you explore and combat other ships in a race to colonize planets first. A bit of memorization is needed for each ship's abilities, and the second play was more rewarding than the first. Fortunately, the game is quick, unique,  and engaging.

Seems quick and fun.  Easy to learn.  I like how you can combo ship abilities or card abilities.  The dice are as crappy as everyone says.  I am getting them replaced by the company!  Got the new dice and they are a big improvement.  I like the basics of the game, but we were feeling like some of the maps weren't very well designed.  I would have accepted fewer map choices if they were balanced rather than a ton of choices that are hit or miss.

Preliminary rating after one full test game at Essen 2013.  

I love games which use dice as pawns or workers (like for example Alien Frontiers or Kingsburg).  Quantum is such a game as your dice represent spaceships.  Low numbers are slow but powerful ships whereas a high number represents a fast but vulnerable vessel.  Players move ships/dice over the board in order to colonize planets and to gain military dominance by attacking other players ships.  Planets are colonized by sending ships with the correct total number of dice values.  For example a planet with a value of 8 could be colonized by sending two ships with values 3 and 5. By colonizing planets players also receive tech cards which give certain special abilities to them.

Regardless of the space theme, Quantum is pretty abstract and has a good deal of direct confrontation and bash-the-leader.  I really liked our test game but I was not sure how good the various cards are balanced.  Furthermore, the combination of tactical decisions and 1D6 rolling left me a little bit puzzled whether the game is won by luck or by skill.

Final verdict: I want to like this game but in Essen, 40€ was slightly to much for me.  Maybe I'll buy it later.

RATING: 10
Amazing.  Just amazing.

I rated this game a ten, so I should justify that a bit.

Think elegance - like of a smartphone.  A smartphone is a phone, but also a watch, and a GPS, and a library, and on and on.  The interface (the touch screen) has a fairly small set of ways you can interact with it; tap, swipe, pinch.  But that's enough to create powerful interfaces for everything from games to spreadsheets.

Who might have guessed that a small, smooth, featureless glass panel could be so expressive?

So consider the d6.  Simple, standard cube with numbers on it.  But from that, the designers wrung out:

- Location marker for your ship
- Ship combat power
- Ship movement speed
- Team identity (red/blue/green/orange)
- Random number generator
- Point scoring (matching a planet's #)
- Counters for two of the major commodities (research, dominance)

That isn't easy.  It's not!  Take a look at just about any board game on your shelf, you're probably going to have a whole bunch of bits and bobs for all sorts of minutiae.  When a game can condense all that into a simple d6, they get some points for elegance.

NOT ONLY THAT, but the mechanics plug in to the theming brilliantly.  Rerolling the ship is a great mechanic, but how to explain what's going on there?  You rip off Douglas Adams, that's how!  How did they do that?  Quantum mechanics.  What?  Magic, don't worry about it.

The artwork is some of the best I've ever seen in the medium, the rules are short and clear, the board is endlessly reconfigurable...

It's just damn good.  Damn damn good good damn good damn damn.  Good.

This quick and dirty (albeit crisp and colorful) space exploration captures a lot of the excitement of larger 4X space games without weighing it down with a lot of micro-management (or requiring a lot of build-up before collisions occur). Furthermore, the ways in which dice can and are manipulated allow for a lot of creative and clever plays without being game breaking either -- while we've seen many, if not most, of the mechanics found within this game elsewhere (e.g., inverting movement and strength on the dice; i.e., low is stronger but moves less -> see BattleBall), this game seamlessly pulls it all together in a vicious but not overly devastating game. Which brings me to my last point - this game incentives aggression (a rare thing in Euro-ish games these days) but also manages to not make the end result of aggressions too devastating either: all ships are easily redeployed (costing an action) rather than permanently destroyed. Again, it's fun, simple enough while encouraging clever and creative play, and all wrapped together with fitting  bright neon aesthetics.

RATING: 5
Decent game. Artwork is fantastic. Components are top, especially those chunky dice. My buddy said his were sticky but after washing them they were just fine.

Theme is not really there.. no mechanic makes particular sense, so it feels more like an abstract.
But a very good, midweight, four player abstract.. every turn you gotta puzzle a little about how & when to use your dice/ships.
The different maps play very differently, if there's space, combat doesn't pay off, if there isn't it get's very cut throat, so choose whichever style you prefer.
Also game-length can be adjusted by adding or removing VP cubes to place.

Dice batch quality aside, a fantastic game. I've played this primarily as a two player experience. Extremely elegant design and very simple to teach new players. Unfortunately it can fall victim to run away leader (in at least 2 player) if one player gets the right combination of power up cards.

An ingeniously designed game.  I have little interest in playing any other sci-fi themed 4x games again.  This condenses into an hour the feeling of a much longer space game, and every decision feels important.  The rules are relatively simple, yet the scope for tactical play is huge.

I would like to stress to dice-o-phobes like me that, even though the dice play a huge role in the visual aspect of the game, *this is not a dice game*.  For the most part, dice are used as counters.  The rolling of dice for combat is such that the player can be confident that the odds are well in their favour (or not), and all elements of dice rolling enjoy the possibility of being removed by cards acquired during the game.

This will surely be remembered as a technical tour-de-force of board game design.

Interesting area control game with dice. Each number represents a completely different type of ship and of course how fast they can move. You can develop technologies (ie: variable player powers). It is a race to spread your influence to a specific number of other planets. It seemed to encourage "attack the leader" near the end.

An elegant space exploration game using dice.  The dice are space ships with movement equal to the number of pips and combat power equal to the inverse, each type of ship also has a special power.  There are cards you can buy to give you other powers. It is a race to settle a number of planets.

Hmmm. Not a great combination of mechanisms: die rolling and multi-player combat. You get all the luck of dice (and you need certain totals to add a quantum cube to a planet) together with all the arbitrariness of deciding whom to attack. The theme has also gone AWOL, this just feels like pushing dice around a board, and for an Ameritrash game theme is everything. Oh and the quality of the actual dice is simply atrocious.

What a brilliant little space colonisation / combat game. Aggression is rewarded which is good, yet it's easy to come back from losing a couple of ships. The card and dice abilities and different clever combinations of things you can do with them are what really make this game shine. It can be over stunningly quickly and shouldn't go more than an hour.

Play twice on BGA. Much more puzzle-like than I've thought. I admire the clean design, but I doubt the actual gameplay.

2p game has a runaway leader, which is probably tolerable because of the short game length, but the game arc is not satisfying, still. 3+p suffers from king-maker, probable AP issue and thus downtime. Also, players are also forced to gang up against the leader, which turn the game into a weird puzzle-like war game.

- Basically an abstract game with the space theme wrapped onto it. You can still feel how the theme was "chosen" and wrapped onto the game.
- Special cards "may" ruin the game in a few cases.

Small ship miniatures (with square  and sink on the bottom to fit stacking as dice) and smaller dice to be put into those ships might fix it.

Go for a deluxe edition please.

The last of the trio of games I played heavily on BGA - Quantum is a game that looked better from afar.

A clean, simple and brilliant abstract game mixed with 4x elements which I love I thought the game would be a 9 star experience at least.  Having played many games with some of the best Quantum players in the world however - I realized the game has some flaws when played optimally.

First, the game is definitely one of those bluff when you're ahead experiences that many high player interaction FFA games boil down to.  If you get off to a great start from lucky rolls, the game is generally fairly self-balancing in that you will be targeted.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as it mitigates lucky opens, though it does mean that 2 player games are generally pretty lame and even 3 player games can become a 1v1 with a third guy that just gets farmed for infamy and has no real hope of winning at any point.  I conclude as many people I played with - Quantum is pretty much a 4 player only game.

So what of the game? Well the tactics are good, though you do realize that there are only 3 pieces that really mean anything - 1, 2 and 3. 4 is usually just a 3, 5's are typically only useful early in the game and 6's are just pieces you hope will become a low number once they get in close to an opponent.  This is because on most maps, constructing a cube becomes almost impossible once 2-3 cubes are placed down.  Even if you do have a small window later on, you have to plan hard for it and even then the high pieces are usually just liabilities.

So far, so good - we have a solid 4 player game - but then come the command cards.  This is where the game takes an ugly turn unfortunately.  Quantum without command cards would just be a subpar abstract game.  Command cards give you something to farm for and reward smart plays - however not all command cards are created equal - and I feel an unfortunate amount of them are just much better than the others.

As the game does usually boil down to a slugfest, cards like Righteous and Dangerous are clear winners.  Because only 3 are available at any given time - whoever happens to be able to grab the cards when they show up will win.  Many games are decided simply by the starting draw of 2 duds and 1 OP card.  Whoever goes first gets the first construct and gets off to a major advantage.  An even worse scenario is not getting one of these cards and then being put into an unfun situation of 'do I grab a dud card to get some power or let someone else take their chances?' because if you are forced to a grab a crud card,  it is never a fun time when a broken command card shows up next for the next player to nab.  I feel this is a massive flaw with the game and would likely require a house rule of some sort - though really you can only house rule so much and in the end better playtesting would have gone a long way.  Despite kingmaking and self-balancing play, some card combos are pretty much 100% wins.  Once a combo like this is established, there is no longer any way to catch up to the winner, even in a 3v1 scenario.  Maybe more sabotages were required, not sure.

Longest review ever I know - but I felt a lot needed to be addressed.  Quantum is fun enough but it never escapes the problems that a game like Cosmic Encounter dealt with so well.

Light 4X (really 2x - it's all expand and exterminate here).  Box says 60 minutes, but I'm seeing 15-20 per player.  

I think this system is really smart - most turns require thoughtful judgment calls.  Not a lot of long-term strategy, but the tactical decisions are interesting.  In our first couple games, I've seen three different occasions where I thought one player or the other had it won within a turn, but each time an opponent was able to conjure up something interesting (but not frustratingly random) to extend the game.

There are some cool mechanics here that I want to like - positioning ships, the special abilities, the use of upgrades, and so on - but I strongly dislike resolving combat via dice rolling. With a better combat system, I'd be much more willing to play this on a regular basis.

Dice are used as ships and moved across the map to place 'quantum cubes'.  This game is pretty easy to learn.  I like how the ships' special abilities let you maneuver through the map in interesting ways.  You have to carefully watch all opponents when playing with more than two so someone doesn't sneak away with the victory. 

Update: Just had a great two player game, increased my rating.  This game gets better and better with more plays as you and your opponents develop new tactics.  Fun to discover killer card combos too.  Great game.

I was a bit surprised by this game. It has an abstract strategy game feel, puzzling out your turn and considering options. The twist is the dice rolling, which adds a hefty dose of luck on the puzzle-cake. It's fun to figure out your turn and attempt to build some combos from cards. There is too much luck for my tastes, but the game plays so fast it's hard to find too much fault there. 

The game lacks a bit of polish. There's a small runaway leader problem, placing cubes gives you powers, which help you place cubes ect... There's interaction though so you can gang up on the leader, which is a form of balancing I abhor. 

The artwork and graphic design on the cards is extremely well done. I am thrilled with how beautiful all the cards are. I would like to play a few more times to see what the game is like with a bit of experience.

Wow - what a great game. The rules are simple and amazingly easy to teach; each ship's movement and power is a simple concept to grasp, and is easy to read and understand at a glance during the course of the game. Variable setup is incredibly quick and provides the some difference in the initial flow of play and keeps things from getting stale from game to game.

Playing the game is simple on the surface, with a decent amount of depth if you're willing to put some thought into optimizing your available turn actions and bonus ship actions. The game rewards aggression if the rolls work in your favour, and doesn't punish you if they don't. As a result, the interaction between players is constant, and keeps everyone involved even when it's not their turn. Variable ship powers add to the depth of the game, as you can make some stunningly quick points by smartly playing your fleet's special powers, and a great selection of card powers adds flexibility to your fleet or provides bursts of additional power. Clever card play can meant the difference between a win and an also-ran.

Can't wait for the inevitable expansion that adds variable player powers. Give me a CE-like mix of alien abilities and I'll be hooked for life.

Quantum packs a whole 4x experience in a dice game playing out in less than an hour. While the look of it is up to the usual Funforge standards, the dice sweated out an oily substance which I don't want to think about. Hello China?
In terms of gameplay, I enjoyed it but it's not a genre I'm looking out for. It features all the issues of other 4x games. Random rolls, player targetting, leaderbashing, sneaking in the win from behind. In such a short game I can live with these. Also in its favour, Quantum cuts out all the gratuitous chrome / rules overhead common for the genre.
If I ever were looking for a condensed 4x game, Quantum would be it. As it stands, [gameid=37919] remains my go-to 4x game. Nonetheless, I wouldn't mind joining rounds of it again.

A dice game that manages to do so much with its dice that it hardly feels like one at all. Quantum plays a lot like "Chess in Space." It has the strategic and tactical depth of an abstract strategy game, but has the flavor of a scifi 4X game. It won't appeal to players averse to abstract games, but it's an extraordinarily unique game that I'd recommend to anyone who thinks they might enjoy it.

RATING: 6
Probably need more plays to get a better grasp of this one. As it is, its too simple. Just roll dice and try to conquer planets. If you're lucky, you'll get them pretty quick. Fighting is also dice rolling, lowest number wins. Maybe a bit more theme would've helped.

It's an abstract war/space game. The cards are extremely powerful  and yet seem to balance well. We are actually enjoying it quite a bit. So far, it's a nice abstract 4x game (which is great in our household!).

+ Thinking of all the combinations you can do
+ Different special abilities via power-up cards
+ Simple rules

± Luck dependent, but game is short enough for a rematch

- Two player game is too long because you can think of all the combinations the other player can do. In a 3 to 4 player game there are too many combinations, so this isn't an issue.

2016-06-12 - 7 - Rather quick, almost abstract game in space, where you deploy your ships and try to obtain control over the planets. Althoung this theme, where you can change your battle station into the little fighter and back is not very consistent. As well as two dimensional space, where the ships can block the way. Anyway I enjoyed it and want to try it again.
Those dice should be better quality though.

Szerintem ez egy nagyon egyedi, különleges játék. Valahogy nem tudok fennakadni a kocka általi szerencsén, úgy érzem, hogy nem azon múlik az eredményesség. Tetszik a hangulata (bár a kép a doboz tetején nagyon filmes, más jellegű játékot sejtet), számomra a "tematikus absztrakt" kategóriába tartozik. Szívesen játszom vele!

I don't often enjoy area-control games with lots of direct conflict, and this is no exception. I do like the ships (dice) having different powers depending on what number was rolled, and the necessity to have a certain total on ships around a planet to claim that world, but on the whole, too much emphasis on combat and not a very compelling 2-player experience,

The base idea of using dice as ships, with pip counts defining their abilities, is very clever. Unfortunately the actual gameplay felt quite repetitive and uninspiring after a few rounds. It seems that it's very difficult to plan ahead, as other players can quite easily destroy your ships before they get to place the quantum cubes.

Each die represents a ship where the value has the following meanings:
Movement, combat strength (lower is better), and ship type (which defines a special function per ship).

12-01-2014 - This one might well get to a 10 rating before all is said and done.  This game is fantastic.  It's spacey and 4X-ish which I like, but abstract enough that non-spacey, non-4Xers like it as well.  I mean, my DAD likes it and he hates gaming in general!  Fantastic game for what it is length- and mechanics-wise.  Solid 9 and it might go up.

Holy shit this game is bad. It is a stalemate until a runaway leader emerges.

Though it seems quite abstract at first, with the addition of variable Advance Cards and the special abilities of ships, the space theme starts to settle in quite nicely.  Also doesn't overstay its welcome since it plays in a good amount of time!  The game has grown on me with each play... can see this being one of my favorite games down the road.

Preferably best with either 3 or 4 players  However, even with 2 players there's still some good conflict back and forth with some battles coming down to the very last cube.

RATING: 7
In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.

Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.

Positive points:
+ The Advance Cards create an ever changing puzzle. But so do the cards in Innovation. 
+ The game rewards clever play: you can often find interesting and creative solutions to the current situation. But I get this feeling in Innovation, too, in the same pressing way. At a lower degree in Equinox and Hive, too, where clever moves are almost always needed but don't necessarily have such a big impact. 
+ Nice Null Hypothesis map: a race for the center, then the need to access the other side of the map after you finish one. Thus, the opponent can block you, you have to travel fast or fond some clever way of moving, etc.

Negative points:
- At least on the Null Hypothesis map, the game was mostly a game of combats, at some point: this can become repetitive (same gripe as with Kemet). 
- In the category of combat games on a map, I prefer the more streamlined and visual 1775.

Conclusion: I may want to sell it back, because I get the fundamental feelings of this game from other games I prefer.

Carefully designed and brilliantly balanced over many years by legendary game designer Eric Zimmerman, Quantum is one of a kind. And I say that quite literally as I own over 600 games and can't think of any that plays like this.

Awesome game, definitely one of my favorite games all all time. The game board and and dice representing movement / ship type and combat strength is one of the most efficient and elegant game mechanic I have ever seen. Yes the dice gods can be against you and you can have a bad game, it happens, but like any great game, it challenges you to think your way out of a bad situation and rewards players for creative thinking. 
The upgrade cards are genius, it takes all the rules of the game and throws them out the window. Which is great, as it makes each game unique and constantly challenges your thinking. Be warned, this game will create long years of gaming rivalry, friends who you thought were nice, will turn into Genghis Khan. If everyone enters the game with this mindset and is happy to leave the carnage at the table, then this game is great. Just don't play with any potential table flippers.

Interesting execution of a dice game, but the dice themselves are almost superfluous except as a budget and ease-of-play alternative to minis.  There's not a lot of clever mechanics concerning them.  However, the real sin of the game is the perennial issue of tying upgrades to victory points.  The rich get richer and the leaders are harder to stop.  Not every game needs to be Power Grid, but maybe this game should have reconsidered this mechanic.

RATING: 7
A rather simple 4x game with surprising amounts of depth.  You begin the game by rolling dice and placing them around a Quantum of your color.  The object is to get a number of Quantum out on the board.  You do this by surrounding a system with pips that match the "number" of the system.  Dice move the number of pips on the board, but the strongest ships are the ones with the few pips.  Each ship has a special ability.  There are cards with unique abilities or one time advantages that can assist in combat.  

I liked the game as it plays fast and the cards add a great deal of replayability.  

A very good game, but it is light and the dice ships make give the game an abstract quality which detracts a bit from the overall 4x play which is very strong.

Quite an accomplishment.  A quick abstract/wargame/4X with many paths to victory.  I like to compare it to discovering books -- as a child your books are going to have lots of pictures, and as you grow older the books have few pictures and lots of words, and yet the images they conjure grow in size and scope.  Here, using dice and square tiles the designer evoked a space opera with fleets, planets, advanced technologies, and struggle.  The die with one pip is the large lumbering behemoth, the one with five pips the nimble interceptor.  Destroyers warp in an out of combat, cruisers bring ships to the frontlines.  Monoliths are built on foreign planets.  Simple, unobtrusive rules, essential board and components, every part matters and every move matters.  The game is short enough that a bad roll simply means you'll play again and tempt lady luck again.  A masterpiece for what it set out to accomplish and did.

Not sure I care for how the first half of the game has everybody off capturing planets without much conflict.  As the board fills up, then conflict increases, but why isn't there more of it throughout the whole game.  Side effect of the plays styles of my friends or just how the game is?  Need to see if I can be successful attacking from the start.  The game is very tactical and clever, but the lack of conflict at the start of the game has started to sour me on the game over time.

There are a couple of flaws, I think.  Some of the cards can be too powerful, so you might want to house rule a method that clears the available cards (maybe lose two research).

Fascinating game though!

More dice and more space, Yeah!!!! Very nice game that doesn't over stay it's welcome, and it's really one for the aggressive people out there :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
*withholding rating until more plays* - This game just feels different! Kind of clunky (not in a bad way) at times. The planet tiles are cool. Combat definitely rewards the aggressor, upon defeat the loser loses a ship, a dominance point, if the aggressor loses he/she loses nothing except an action. So I don't know how I feel about the battle system. I guess the advantage is who attacks first, which in dogfighting, makes all the difference right? Some of the cards can seem overpowered, but that's why you pick them! Really fun game, can take a while if you want a longer game.

*** Played a few more times. The cards can change gameplay a lot, not only for the player who has them but for the players who don't get certain ones. It forces you to change tactics. This game feels different when you have two players compared to three or four. Still super fun.

Interesting little game with some fun mechanics.  Each person rolls 3 dice to set up their "fleet" of ships.  Each denomination of the dice counts as a different ship with different powers.  You try to get a combination of your ships around a planet.  Each planet has a specific number which you try to match with your dice values.  If you match it you can put a cube on that location.  Once a player is out of cubes, game ends.

There's a lot of variability to the game and this is one I might actually buy when it hits the shelves.

Doesn't seem quite as fun at 2-players, but I may need more research to see if that holds true for different map configurations.  Also would like to try it with larger groups.

As for component quality, the dice are nice and chinky and the boards are nice and thick, though I did have to have replacement dice sent to me (the original dice had a "sticky" feel to them, which is apparently common with early printings of this game).

Gameplay offers a lot of versatility, but the mechanics seem rather forced.

With 'Void' promo (Essen); base game signed by Eric himself. :)

The game is light/accessible, abstract with a bit of randomness and (for me) a great theme. I really like the use of the dice in this game. In the beginning of all my games there were huge differences between players (in quantum cubes played), but it levels out in the endgame. There are very subtle and mutliple ways to hamper someone placing their last cube and getting to place the last cube yourself.

Edit: played it a few times with a visually impaired friend and he likes it. There is much to remember, but everything in the game is open information. My friend likes the game very much: just the right amount of thinking and luck, though he has to get used to the cards breaking the rules. I adjusted the rating.

Simply put, Quantum is a masterpiece of abstract gaming.  It is a game that is so tightly balanced and dependent on players staying constantly in tune that it verges to fall apart and hand a win to the more attentive player at any moment.  Layer this tight foundation with the ability to tune your own strategy through upgrades, multiple map set ups and more than a single path to victory and you have all the cornerstones of a legendary game.  Forget the hate about minor production issues, the game is too good to let such things matter.

I really like the idea of this game and the use of dice for various ships was very clever and fun.  There are several different strategies for points or upgrades and it was enjoyable to look for combos between ships.  Components were great and art style was very appealing.  Overall, the play felt a bit slow and the game a bit long for what I wanted.  Also trying to set up your ships to score at the beginning of your next turn could be frustrating.  Overall, an enjoyable game but just didn't compel me toward numerous plays.

Fun game with interesting puzzles on each turn.  I like finding neat, unexpected moves that surprise my opponent and make maximum use of my ships' abilities.  I also like the combo-building aspect and having to decide between one-time use powers and permanent abilities. 

Used to be rated higher, and maybe still could be, but it doesn't play as well with two and Meg will never suggest it.

So far, only one play - but the game is fun, quick and elegant. The game encourages attacking - it is not a Euro game - and feels more like Ameritrash, but perhaps more streamlined or perhaps a little abstract. The mechanics work well - and I found myself quickly remembering each ship type and ability after a few turns. I want to play a few more times with different groups and see if I might change my rating.

I really enjoyed this design. Dice are used for ships, where the larger the number the stronger the ship is but the slower its movement. Each type of ship (there are 6, 1 for each side of the die) also has a special power that can be used once per turn. Beyond that you're simply trying to colonize planets. Additionally, there are instant and long-term powers/actions that can be acquired.

What really makes the game work though is that the game really encourages attacking. Attackers win ties, cannot lose ships and can gain dominance. Maps can be easily adjusted to make for a longer game by creating bottlenecks where players really need to fight their way through the middle of the board.

The feeling of the game is along the same lines as [gameid=15363] with lots of skirmishes and interesting combinations of the power cards.

An honest filler, with good ideas and ok components. Cards apart. The cards in this game are only 1 step above a butterfly wing: for 40 EUR, I'd expect something MORE.
Also the italian version has opaque dice - tell me what you were thinking - and the planet squares will easily scratch. Player boards are ok...uselessly ok.

Grumbles apart, the mechanics are nice, it plays fast but you have to think about what you're doing, and the luck of the dice is nicely balanced with the cards (...the cards! [i]Arrrgh![/i]) - both monouse and continual.

Overall: a dry exercise.

Cards seem to be a big advantage, and getting them early can mean some big advantages, especially in a 2 player game.

In 2 player, it just doesn't seem very balanced. It's too much based on fickle luck and early advantage.

With more than 2 players, the only balancing mechanic to prevent a runaway leader is merely the motivating for trailing players to gang up on the leader.

A couple bad rolls can cause you to straggle helplessly behind.

I kind of love this game even though it is mostly a frustrating experience unless you have evenly balanced players and the right board setup. Trying to figure out how to make the individual ship abilities and card powers mesh is a lovely puzzle. -- Don't bother playing this as a 2-player game, it's only good with 3 or (better) 4.

I described the game to a friend as follows: "Quantum is a snowball game where winning makes you win MORE and MORE, snatching up one brutally powerful card after another--it's almost impossible to come from behind. Tash-Kalar is a wrestling match, whereas Quantum is like handing everyone a bunch of guns then pointing at a stockpile of even bigger guns and ammo across the room and saying '1, 2, 3--go!'"

Basically, it's a game that has a great basic mechanic (a chessgame made out of dice!) but lacks things like resource management or competing routes to victory that would balance it.

[EDIT 30 Nov 2016:] The more I play this game the more it just feels pointless and unpleasant. Feh. Pushed the rating down to 5 and won't play it again.

The best game I've played so far. Easy to learn, the components are great (those big chunky dice!), the artwork is gorgeus... It even has a short but interesting narrative! I just can get enough. The mechanics are well balanced, with some high-level estrategy (like preparing a check-mate) and some randomness to keep the game fresh. Also, the diferent maps adds a lot of replay value and tailors the kind of round that the players wants (more combat or conquest).

For now, my favorite boardgame.

Uses dice in a lot of interesting ways, but at the end of the day, it's just a game about chucking dice and seeing what happens.

Extremely fast to setup, customisable, deeply satisfying to the combo-itch. This is my number one game to whip out when I want depth without fiddliness or chores. It is possible to quickly catch-up from far behind, with the right play... The progressive increase in difficulty to place later cubes is offset by getting more cards. This is a beautiful and aesthetically elegant design. Benefits a lot from maps that aren't too compact.

This game impresses me with it's puzzle-like nature. The way the dice are used as ships and the multiple ways to lay down quantum cubes (and move closer to victory) prompts a lot of creative play. My favorite thing is having that toolbox and trying to figure out how to best move forward. With a modular board, simple rules, and brain-burning choices, this game has become a winner on my list.

A game of space exploration and combat based around an interesting mechanic - each spaceship is a die whose value represents its type, controlling both movement ability and combat strength (lower values are stronger), plus a special ability unique to each type.

RATING: 4.5
Cleverly designed dice game. Dice rolls are your ships, number rolled is movement, however during conflict, die number is added to attack die and lowest wins. Thus, a dice roll of '1' moves very slowly and is extremely powerful(a battlestar). Each ship / dice also has a unique ability. Aim is to establish colonies around surrounding planets the fastest. 

PROS
-Luck is there but minimised, each dice roll has a role and power to be used. 
-Intuitive after first couple of rounds.
-Can be fun fast and lightweight.  

CONS
-Is a small war game/ area control game, so can be vulnerable to undesirable alliances and king making.
-Person with a battlestar (D6 = 1) can have a lot of influence if that ship can be moved around fast (e.g. combining with warp ability of a D6 = 3.
-Because of the dice long term planning can be difficult, you will eventually need to re-roll to change strategy, which is where luck can come back: you get the ship you need or you don't. 
-Initial dice supplied were sticky, the copy I played had third party dice specifically ordered (they are quite a large uncommon size).

RATING: 7
Played two games, both two player. Nice depth in decision making. Not a hard game to learn, but a good level of mastery. Nice variety in the Advance Cards and the different maps. Plus, the player boards explain everything in a clean fashion. After playing it through, it can drag a little bit on the time.

The biggest issue is I have a hard time finding the right crowd to have it hit the table. I like the strategy, but I enjoy abstracts. This is not an abstract that I would introduce to the non-player of the genre. I'd be more likely to pull out Santorini or The Rose King or Hounded. This is fun, but even more thinky than the other 3, so it's hard to find that right group to play with.

Kind of wish I wouldn't have traded it, but that's ok. You win some, you lose some.

Grande successo che però mi ha lasciato un tantino perlesso. Il gioco di esplorazione spaziale ha degli spunti interessanti legati alla gestione e all'utilizzo dei dadi, che tanto di moda sta andando. A farmi storcere il naso sono il kingmaking, i tempi morti se giocato in 4 giocatori ma soprattutto l'evidente richiamo agli attacchi stile Risiko! In Quantum infatti troviamo lo stesso impianto di battaglia utilizzato per il famoso capostipite, con la differenza che in caso di pareggio vince l'attacco. Questo meccanismo insieme a delle possibili combo tremende con l'acquisizione di carte beneficio rendono a mio avviso il gioco ingovernabile e soggetto al caso.

RATING: 5
Lots of clever use of dice here, and nice components, but the space generic space theme and standard power cards and "abstract playing piece" types don't do much for me. There is also a lot of luck involved - die rolls determine both battle outcomes and the types of spaceships you get.

Abstracts like this with more than two players often suffer from the same problems: one player attacks another repeatedly, and the victim has no chance ... while another player left alone elsewhere on the board gets far ahead in development. The four-player game I played ended with the winner having 6 colonizations and another player still having just the 1 he started with. Not a fun game for that player. (Partly my fault for continually attacking him, partly bad luck on die rolls.)

[i]- Dice as ships: each number is a different type of ship with it's own special power.
- Finding the combos between using your 3 basic actions and your ships special powers.
- Researching/ placing quantum cubes nets you cards which either grant a lasting ability or a one time ability 
(The card powers are great and work well and let you manipulate the game in different ways).
- Great artwork and production.

There's luck, plenty of luck, but there's nearly always cool things you can do on your turn, like piggybacking a ship somewhere or swapping ships around which provides interest and surprise most turns. And if all else fails, there's always a good ol' fashioned re-roll to get the miracle you need. It's multi-player combat at its core, so inevitably the game probably falls to the player hit the least, but the short timeframe perfectly suits, so the issue doesn't define and bury the game like it may a longer game. Special powers help provide some replayability, but there's probably not enough map / scenario variety to generate real longevity given it's essentially a themeless abstract game. Still, good fun and clever for what it offers ... as long as it's in small doses.

In Quantum, players flying their spaceships (actually dice) around the board trying to claim "quantum cubes" by having the right combination of numbers on the dice.  The number of pips on the dice represent the ship's speed (higher = better) and the ship's power (lower = better), as well as a special ability the ship has.  Certain abilities let you change the value of your ship.  Along the way, you can combat other player's ships and claim other special ability cards.  This game really felt more like a multiplayer combat game than I expected it to (a genre I'm not a huge fan of).  Trying to throw wrenches in your opponents' plan is a far better tactic than trying to puzzle out how to address the board.

I felt like the techs were interesting and there was just enough luck to give a fighting chance late in the game. Took all the fluff out of Eclipse/Twilight Imperium and distilled it into quick playing clever abstract game. This game is bordering an 8, but I think overall the abstract feeling of it brings it down a point. I think there is quite a bit of longevity in this game and I'd love to see an expansion. Maybe unique races/planets?

I do feel like there is plenty of clever plays in this game. It keeps unfolding as we play. Really looking forward to a 4 player game of this.

Great components although the dice were a bit lacking. I'm not sure how evenly created they are. I noticed some bumps and errors on the dice. Mine were incredibly sticky and I've requested replacement dice.

This is a beautiful game in that I almost correctly never predict how the end-game will go. The combat is simple, but this game is not as luck-based as new players will assume. Do not start fights when the odds are against you, unless you are just trying to stop someone from winning. The movement of the dice combines with the command cards to create a challenging puzzle that is incredibly fun. Player interaction is high. Turns are quick. And each card makes you feel unique and powerful. Looking forward to many more games of this.

Firstly, Quantum is -beautiful-.
Game is great. So many options every turn! The black and white cards really drive your strategies.

I was pleasantly surprised by Quantum. The clever use of the dice as space ships that have different movement, attack, and special powers is a pretty clean and engaging system. The variable board layout and power cards that are available provide variety and give some different ways to reach the goal of placing your quantum cubes on the board. All of this in a quick 45-60 minutes made for a really pleasant experience. I’m happy to play this again.

Twilight Imperium 3rd ed., Exodus: Proxima Centauri, Space Empires 4X, Hegemonic, and even Eclipse are all sprawling, multi-hour, table-cluttering affairs that you really need to plan for to make them happen. Enter Quantum, a genuine 4X space opera game, explained in 5 minutes, completed in an hour, and with an exeptionally small footprint compared to all the other table hogs mentioned above. It is a marvelous sight to behold from a game design standpoint. Every thematic complexity; ship type, speed, attack power, defence value, special abilities, are all just mechanically ingrained in a bunch of semi-translucent six-sided dice. The epic feel that most other games of the genre deliver got lost though, thanks in no small part to the extreme streamlining. But even so the game play sure is entertaining, highly interactive, and truly thought provoking as you try your damnedest to combine ability usage with ship manoeuvring in order to achieve your tactical and strategic goals.

Really, really nice art! For a "dice" game, it's actually not too random, which is nice. Plays which and does a good job of scratching that 4X itch. Definitely better with more, rather than less, players. Also plays a bit as if it were a puzzle game, which is okay (not something I, personally, usually go for).

Quite a simple dice-as-ships conflict game with a sort of modular board*. It is a good design, but there's a bit of the smack-the-leader syndrome to it and the end often seems to come down to whoever gets lucky with a good power card coming up.

*For the life of me, I can't understand why the board art is the same on both sides of the tiles. How hard would it be to A) make a different mix of planet types or even B) add features in space like nebulae or worm holes or anything. Missed opportunity.

This game is so entertaining. Not a lot of tedious accounting, but really mentally challenging in the best way. 

Also enjoyable because there is always the tension between helping yourself vs going after whomever is winning at that moment.

RATING: 8
The box full of dice is somewhat deceiving. Dice-rolling plays a significant role, but mostly the dice are used as a very elegant way to track multiple properties without using loads of chits. It's a tactical space combat/colonisation game in which the six dice faces are used to represent different classes of ship.

The number on a die tells you:
1. how far that ship can move in a turn 
2. the attack/defence value of a ship (low numbers win, so a 1-ship is hard to move but potent in combat)
3. the special power of a ship, e.g. 3s can 'warp', swapping position with any of your other ships

And finally, to colonise a planet you need to have ships surrounding it with a total value equal to the planet's number (7, 8, 9 or 10)

You get three actions per turn from a menu of five, plus each ship can use its special power once. That leads to some chained turns that are fun puzzles to plan but can get a little hard to keep track of. Colonising a planet takes two actions though, so you need to get in position the turn before, leaving the others a chance to disrupt. 

Being aggressive is highly rewarded. Attackers win ties in combat, and the downside is lower for an attacker too. Aggression also gives you an alternative way to colonise, as each time you successfully attack you gain a dominance point (on another die!), and reaching 6 gives you a colonisation. First to colonise 5 planets wins the game.

Finally, there are special power cards (both permanent and one-shot) which you gain each time you colonise, or by boosting your research to 6 (on guess what, another die). 

It reminds me in parts of Alien Frontiers and King of Tokyo - and also a little of Primordial Soup. The whole thing should never be longer than an hour, and it has a modular board setup for replayability. Good stuff!

RATING: 5
An awkward mash-up of a random dice chucker and a 4X strategy game. A lot of the pieces of the gameplay were interesting, but they just don't come together very well. Combat feels a bit anticlimactic and the random factor of the dice rolling is a bit too strong for my taste in a game that seems to be trying to be more about strategy. I'm all for it in a game like King of Tokyo, but it felt off in Quantum.

This is a game where you move around, trying to place 'quantum cubes' on planets (first to place all their cubes wins), while maneuvering your die ships around the board. Your ships are dice, and what face is showing dictates how far it can move in one turn, and its abilities. So lower numbers are slow but more powerful (combat is resolved by rolling dice, adding your ship's number, and lowest wins), and higher numbers are mobile. To place quantum cubes, you need to have your ships orthogonal to a planet and totaling that planet's exact value.

So.. there are a few more mechanics involved to this, but it's essentially a basic action point allocation and checkerboard geometry type game without much flash, just a tacked on spaceship theme.

RATING: 6
Love the theme, the idea, the elegance of the design, BUT damn is that combat infuriating. For example losing a "2" to a "4", which happens around a quarter of the time, is really bad. Losing 2 combats like that practically loses you a 45 minute game. Combine that with the fact that attacking is so strong, because you don't lose your ship in a failed attack, results in many close to risk-free attempts at sniping lower numbered ships.
This becomes an even bigger issue in 3/4 player games with constant leader bashing.
You either get ignored and win, get some good rolls and stomp, or go from first to last with 2 bad rolls.
It's a dice game,  unfortunately I expected less variance than there is.

Wow, what great game! Very versatile and smart usage of dice, which results in a lot of decisions, fun and, yes, still rolling dice. Simple rules, short playing time, huge replayability, due to various ship/card/board configurations. I love games that give you a set of actions and then freedom to use them (vide Eclipse, Android: Netrunner, itd.). It gives a vast field for strategy, tactic, and meaningful choices. Quantum resembles "sort of" 4X lite, like a streamlined, lightweight Eclipse, "sort of" looks and feels like Metallum (ships, planets, placing cubes, action management), "sort of" plays like Quarriors/King of Tokyo (it's almost last round and I'm screwed, but if I move this here, that there, use this action, roll and get less that 3, I'm good). But it's not any of these games, it's different and preserves its unique character. 

With Tash-Kalar, best games of 2013, hands down!

I generally am shy of space theme games. To my tastes, they often have too much to manage, or they take too long just by nature of their design. This game attempts to turn that around, and in many groups it should be successful at it. It was easy to manage and not too hard to understand. Yet, in a skilled group that knows to dogpile the leader until the next leader becomes apparent, the game can stretch longer than its design seems to be meant to handle gracefully. But there's a good game to be found here. less to worry about than Eclipse.

Clever space conquest themed but relatively abstract game. Love how dice are used to represent ships and at the same time provide their combat value (lower is better) and movement allowance (lower is slower). Command cards acquired through research allow players to customize their races, but look like they can potentially unbalance the game, especially with fewer players. More epic feeling can probably be had from my other games in the genre such as Forbidden Stars, Srar Treat Acendancy or even Onwards to Venus.

1st play: Very promising! Will definitely play this game again!

2nd play: Still an okay game - but definitely didn't live up to the experience I had from first play

After 4 plays: Not a big fan of this game. Way too luck dependent. You can make some interesting combos with the different cards. Getting these combos either requires luck or good cards and getting those initial good cards requires luck. The game thus has this feeling, that the lucky player gets rewarded and is granted HUGE advantages, whereas the less lucky player will find themselves looking at the watch a lot.
Too long with 4 players. Would consider trying it again in the right mood though (preferably with 3 players)

I love 90% of Quantum. The way dice are used as different kind of ships with special powers, the cards players can earn by completing different goals, how planets are conquered, etc. It's great. That being said, with my limited experience, it seems it's easy for the end game to get bogged down with everyone ganging up on the leader until certain actions cards show up and push someone into the win. This can be mitigated with different board setups, but that does limit the variety available in the game. Still, Quantum is a game I can easily recommend.

Quantum is a light abstract wargame for two or more players. Players move ships (represented by dice) around the board - high dice are fast, low dice are powerful. They seek either to occupy a planet or destroy enemy ships. Both routes allow players to deploy their cubes - deploy four and you win the game.
Quantum plays quickly and builds towards a satisfying climactic engagement. The mechanics are simply but engaging.

RATING: 9
This is my first 4X-ish game and I'm just thrilled I cut my teeth on this genre, with this game. The rules take only a couple of minutes to explain, and the player boards and cards do an excellent job of helping you remember the essentials - this means the amount of cognitive load for remembeing rules is greatly reduced, giving you more ability to focus on making the best moves.

This game fills a hole in my collection - something that's not too cerebral, is a bit swingy and chaotic, and rewards creative ideas.

On my second play, I had a 4-player game.  3 of us were one cube away from winning; the last had 2 cubes. We were certain he was out of the game, so we were trying to figure out which of the remaining 3 was going to finish it.  It was his turn.  He had 5 dominance and a Command card that gave him an extra action.  So he started by engaging in a battle, which he won; he then places the first of his quantum cubes. On the other side of the map, for his second action, he moves one ship to a planet to get the required total. Then he uses his remaining two actions to plant another cube, winning the game.  Absolutely brilliant!  We were all laughing at that amazing come-from-behind finish.

Not all my games are like that. I'm glad to have Quantum be part of my collection.

This game, owned by a member of our gaming group, got quite a lot of play when it was new, and while we've not played for a while, I would be surprised if it never came out again at our game nights. (We actually played it just last night - December 2015 - the first play in I think over a year.) I liked this a lot at first, and still think it's a good and interesting game, although it's not one I love enough to rate 8 or higher. A little brain-burny but still relatively quick, this seems to be mainly a game of tactical manouvering, but done in a rather fun and original way (you are moving dice which represent spaceships, each die value represents a different type of ship with a different special ability - you can use one action to reroll a ship - and where the higher numbered ships can move faster but are weaker in combat). And the different map setups lead to games of totally different character (at the moment I feel I prefer the tight ones forcing combat to happen more). Definitely interesting enough for me to be willing to play quite often.

Initial play was a 2p basic game. It seemed really fast and lacked something. After discussing with my opponent, we think that even though it can be played with 2p that it is best played with 4p (or at the least 3p). Will have to try again with higher player count and advanced maps.

Very mixed feelings.  I love everything about the game except the runaway winner / lack of catch-up mechanics / mid-game slog / picking on one player and locking them out.  Politics isn't really enough, and it's a case where the winners not only win by more but also take longer turns and do more interesting things.  So, I think something small but critical is missing.

The dice aren't very random, but the game feels random and frustrating as a whole.

RATING: 2.5
It's a light DoaM type game meets Krammer's AP inducing systems. Heh. But it's true!

Game design part is pretty impressive - how one can create basically a full blown space conflict/exploration game with very simple and streamlined rules. Just the spatial play gives you many possibilities of doing clever things with special powers of your spaceships. The game heavily promotes aggression and is quite dynamic. 

There are two problems with the game. Okay maybe three. 

First is that it's a multiplayer game with no structure that would steer the metagame - so if people don't know they are supposed to attack whoever is in front, it can be a frustrating experience. It's not a deal breaker, but means you need to play it people who understand how one should play these games. But, there's another problem with this dynamics - it can make the game last a long time and a bit overstay its welcome. 

Second one having good ol' action points producing good ol' analysis paralysis. It's really Kramer all over again - the game is tactical, long term plans not really viable, meaning you'll figure out what you need to do only as your turn comes along (ok, I prepare for certain paths, but that's me - so play with people who do). Then some people need time to internalise all the special powers (whole six of them...) and this might take a while.

Third one is that it's hard to keep track of what you're doing when you're doing it. Harder than I found with old Kramer's games. It would be helpful if there'd be a an action point track or markers or something that you'd knew how many points you've spent. The other thing is tracking of which ships have already used their special power for the turn. We put them diagonally and it did make the game flow a bit smoother. And then you just need to remember which ships already moved. 

So, interesting premise, definitely needs people who either play quickly or have played enough to have internalised the rules. Will need to play more to properly evaluate. 

Rating down: 
- groupthink influenced game
- drags

Interesting dice game that is different than most of the games I've played. The theme does not come through at all. Depending on your roll and how ships are placed on the board, you could get really screwed to a point that there is no chance of a comeback. The card balance seems iffy but all in all it is an ok game if you want a somewhat short dice fest.

The game's big idea of having numbers represent spaceships is all right...sounds better in the description than it actually plays out.

It's good they used dice for the ships, otherwise this idea would never fly.

This is an incredible game. It feels like a multi-player objective based war game. IN SPACE! It is streamlined. The powers are balanced. And your strategy will constantly change throughout the game. One game in particular, my wife had all of her quantum cubes on the board but one. I surrounded that planet with strong fighters while sending other ships (dice) off to settle planets. I caught up and ended up loosing one turn before I would have settled my final planet.I can't say enough good things about this game.

This is an interesting abstract that has been pretty well thought-out. We played it with just 2, and I'd love to see how it works with more players. There are definitely a couple of paths to victory, and while there is a bit of luck in the game (there are dice here, after all), it's good. I like that your victory points (i.e. quantum cubes) don't go away, so your real work is in trying to prevent them from getting on the board in the first place.

Way more enjoyable than I expected. I generally prefer cards to dice, but Quantum is an excellent dice game. It's surprisingly deep for a game of its weight and type and impressively elegant given all the flexibility in the rules. Decisions are less obvious than in what's probably its closest comparator, King of Tokyo. Quantum is a lot more open by comparison, and for that reason more interesting as well. There's a bash the leader end-game which can be a bit mindless, but it's a fun ride even so. You have to admire the cleverness of the design.

It can be a flop with the wrong group. Best played fast and loose.

Okay game overall but feels a bit constricted and too much "bash on the leader" for my tastes. Also, some of the cards seem way stronger than others and are really only mitigated by other players realizing this and focusing on attacking that player.

Not a huge fan of games that require player knowledge to balance it, especially in a heavy conflict game.

tl;dr: clean design

This game has been on my 'to try' list since it came out. It always looked really cool to me, but I never felt confident it was something for me, so I never got a copy for myself.
I finally got to try it. The rules where short and very efficient. This game does quite a bit with very few and very straight forward rules. Yes, a very nice and clean design.
The game is far too aggressive for my taste though. The playing area is very small so the game is just getting started and players are already pushing and pulling against each other. And we only played with 2! I can't imagine how aggressive this is with 4. But I wouldn't recommend playing this with 2, it must be better with more, probably best with 4 as I can see the 3 player game have that '2 players fight, the 3rd player wins' thing. But that's just a guess.
So I really admire the design, I just don't have any interest in playing this. Good stuff, but not for me.

I didn't have high hopes for Quantum. I'd read the rules previously and it sounded interesting, but decided against picking it up.

The cards offer some wacky combos and I've heard a number of times where the game is resolved quickly as a player gets a powerful combo that can't be stopped. In our game, a player had to essentially suicide himself by taking a card that didn't really benefit him to prevent me taking it.

It's nicely put together but it didn't wow me at all.

The rules of this game hooked me before I ever played it. It sounded so smart, so elegant. I admit I was excited, but also frustrated it had slipped under my radar, and in turn hesitant-- what if I was overselling this game to myself? Luckily, it didn't disappoint. The randomness is heavily mitigated by player strategy, the mechanics which actually make combat quite predictable, and the card abilities which often mitigate it further. The rare randomness that remains actually fits the theme of quantum physics, and in my mind improves the game as a result. One of those instances where rolling dice really is the best design solution. And the rules are just as brilliant as they sound-- in fact, more brilliant in action. The three-actions-per-turn in conjunction with the ship abilities, card effects, and multiple ways of placing cubes leads to a beautiful dance on the board consisting of a delightful back and forth and ingenious combos.

First game ever I bought on impulse of watching a video review. Thank you 'Shut up& Sit down'. This game is just like you say. It's clever, it's intuitive, it's got a lean set of rules you can explain in 5 minutes and it plays fast. Maybe a little too fast as the finish was brought forward untimely due to a favorable constellation of advance cards and dice rolls.

Excellent borderline-filler game that takes less than an hour to play and isn't nearly as simplistic as it looks — in fact, with four savvy players it's rather intense as everyone gathers enough research, dominance, and quantum cubes to command the board. Fabulous space game!

I really enjoy how this game uses dice to represent multiple aspects of a single ship. It plays like a very tight chess match with two players and turns into fun chaos with three or four. The balance in three seems a bit off as once all players are one quantum cube away from winning, there are disincentives to them stopping another player (as the third, uninvolved, player can usually swoop in and win).

Reasonably fun and fast.  Getting attacked can really screw you, especially if it happens in the early turns and you're late in turn order plus obviously the swing of the dice will turn a lot of people off.

Bumped this up to a 9 and is one of my favorite games...Space themed abstract.

Would be cool if there were starting powers but its not a huge deal.  The game plays quick enough and there's some good tactical decisions in how you manipulate and position the dice for defense or offense.

Played with 4 and 2 and there really isn't that much of a difference.  It scales really well and I think the map configuration makes a bigger difference in the way player interaction occurs than the number of players.

RATING: 7
A very fun abstract "4x" type game. All our games were fun, be it 2P, 3P, 4P.

Great mechanics, the rules are easily grasped.

You can win employing many different strategies, which can appeal to many gamer's "profiles" (my wife enjoys it quite a bit, whereas she usually hates conflict-orinted games).

The pros :

- simple and very smart mechanisms (the trade-off between speed and power, the use of dice as ships, the "transformation" of ships on a roll of a die)
- replayability : modular board and evolving number of cubes to place make for an ever-changing experience, from small skirmish-, battle oriented games to deep colonization journeys (length of game is not a factor of the size of the board, it could even be the contrary)

The cons :

- terrible art (to my taste - I reckon it's really a matter of taste, as many others seem to enjoy the card and board artwork). Too "childish" for me, I'd rather had a more "serious" approach to drawing characters, ships and sceneries.
- story-telling factor : the game is a bit "cold" to my taste, and not really  immersive. The "story" behind the cubes and everything is of virtually no importance, and serves nothing in the game. The authors should have kept to a simple, plain space conquest narrative.
- the different "peoples" that the game opponents are supposed to embody have no specific characterizations or differences that matter in the game. This was a major disappointment, because a little "RPG" aspect would have fleshed up a bit the dryness of the game. It doesn't matter if you take "Orion" or "Kepler", they are all equal (no special powers, no specific objectives). They are just the blues and the reds...

All in all, a great compact abstract game, with a lot of possibilities, and a lot of life in it. It hits the table many times at home and in the gaming room, with no sign of growing boredom from my circle of fellow and family gamers, so it rather be quite good !

In our first couple of plays, didn't love it, but we need to give it a better chance.

After a couple more plays, my wife has rejected it, and it hasn't reached the table with anyone else. Basically, we don't like the dynamic of "roll for control of a spot/get beat/come back the next turn and roll again for that spot/get beat again/come back again/oh, good I got my roll this time." That's a little unfair, and this game has a likeable presentation--I want to like it, and I know it deserves a better chance--but that basic dice combat thing does make us feel a little bored. Clever touches in the design, though, and I haven't played it enough to rate it.

Very cleverly designed game. Hardly feels random at all even though there is quite a bit of dice-throwing in it. Can be super-vicious depending on the board setup and the players if you like that sort of thing, but it's also possible to reduce the amount of combat by having a more spacious board.
May not appeal to everybody, but for me its quick and fun enough to be enjoyable each time.

Positive:

 + Straightforward enough to play with casual gamers

 + Enjoyable tactics with several viable ways to get points

 + Very good art and (with the exception of the first run dice) production values. Insert is well thought out.

Negative:

 - feels like it takes too long for weight of gameplay

 - Some cards feel overpowered (Clever, anyone?)

 - Dice mitigation not quite what it could be. Need to roll two dice instead of one for combat, at the very least.

Ultimately it feels overlong and lacking something important. 6.5 is probably too harsh, but oh well.

Oct 2017:  Played once with 2P.  It was fun, but still doesn't live up to my original expectations.  Hasn't been played again because there are other games we find ourselves reaching for.  -1 Rating (down to 6)

Original:
I suspect my rating will go up with more plays.  First game was 3 players and the basic map and ended after only about 5 rounds.  Seemed too easy for someone to get all their cubes out and not as much combat as I expected.  Will try advanced maps in the future.

RATING: 9
This game is excellent.  I kept hearing praise for it, but was initially turned off by the bland art style and abstract nature of the dice.  That was a mistake because once you play it you realize how ingeniously simple the idea is.  The number on the die is both your movement and your power and also your ability to take planets.  The only thing you have to learn is what each ships power is, which doesn't take long at all.

This game gives a great modern, chess feel as it's heavily tactical but also with really neat card combo's and just the right amount of dice rolling.  Love it!

My biggest set back with it though, is that while there isn't much of a learning curve, an experienced player will always win over someone's first game, it's hard to not play well and people tend to not like losing when they don't fully understand a game.

light space themed hybrid, where you move your spaceships around the board attacking other player's and positioning yourself to unload cube onto planets. I liked it more than I thought I would ^^

[+] sturdy components, variable setups, lots of interactions (attack, blocking, race), feels like a puzzle when you have your ships each with their own "free" move and you try to take the best of it
[-] it has a decelerating progress curve, where you get to "score" half your points very fast, then the board start to fill and it can drag a bit until someone reaches victory; there's the usual take-that balance system, meaning the players have to gang up on the leader to stay in the game.

Quantum is only becoming more fun with more plays. One of my favorite strategy games. The two player game is over a little too quick for my taste, but the 3/4 player game is a good length.  
My only complaint is that, in multiplayer games, it's very easy to get a huge advantage if people aren't denying you quickly, and it has a small steamroll problem. But, there are a few counters to catch up to players once they get strong, so it doesn't detract too much!

Just got my own copy! I might make a little houserule/map for dropping down more cubes to extend the game a bit.

Beautiful looking semi-abstract dice game (some of the dice of the original game had production problems, but you can ask for free replacements). 

Quick game play, relatively simple rules, but lots of depth and strategy. The balance between luck and skill seems just right (it still is a dice game most and foremost). 

This is one of those kinds of games that makes you go "one more round". The elegance of creating a rich gameplay experience of merely four dice and a small map adds to the appeal.

This having said, the two player experience is a bit rough. Games end quickly/abruptly, with most player interaction in the last couple of turns only and some of the complexity of the game created by bonus cards that one can earn over time never kicks in. 

We are currently on some house rules, and they have helped create a more satisfying experience for us, but there are still a few kinks left to iron out. Will rate higher once these issues are fixed.

Quantum requires repeated play. Balance with 2 players is very good if both of them know what they do, otherwise you can get the impression that some cards are broken. After 50 plays I still feel that there is a lot of room for improvement of my strategy.

This is a little too abstract for my tastes, so I will never love it...but I have to say it's a pretty ingenious design. It uses the die faces of a d6 to represent different ship types, all with unique movement abilities and powers. The object of the game is to manipulate the dice to allow you to move into various formations to capture map objectives. Like I said, it's completely abstract yet everything feels perfectly appropriate to a spaceship themed strategy battle game. Very cool, for what it is.

The theme and the mechanics of this game are fantastic. It's part abstract puzzle, part space battle and a whole lot of fun.

Unfortunately the best way i can describe it (after one play) is "dull".It's not a bad game, absolutely. It works, and it ends fast (probably the best thing i can say about it) but it has nothing captivating, nothing really original, it is too luck dependent and the theme is absoultely trite and corny (i have nothing against good game with pasted on theme, i am a Knizia fan after all) but here it seems they are trying to have a good theme, they care about the theme... and there is nothing tematic. It's just an exercise in dice throwing and moving around. if you want Space + Dice, try Alien Frontiers and see the difference.

RATING: 7
This game was a pleasant surprise. Science fiction is one of my favorite themes and I already have a good number of excellent games in that genre: Race for the Galaxy, Eclipse, Cosmic Encounter, Merchant of Venus, and Galaxy Trucker. Yet, with the exception of Race for the Galaxy, most of those games are on the longer side.

Quantum on the other hand, is a nice short, tight game with simple rules that can be quickly taught. The mechanics are balanced really nicely and everything makes a lot of sense with the ships (dice) moving the number of spaces equal to their facing, and attacks happening with the facing of the die plus the roll of another die and the low number winning. There's attacking in the game, but it's light and easy to come back from, so being attacked will barely affect you.

I wish there was more asymmetry from the start in the form of races (a la Cosmic Encounter), but you can make your side your own through the cards. Also, if you have the first printing, be sure to contact Passport Game Studios to get a set of dice that isn't sticky. 

I see this game sticking around for a bit due to it's length of play, the simplicity of the rules, and the flexibility of the setup. Well worth playing.

Very fun game and not overly complex. Strategic planning and outsmarting your opponent can definitely help you win but RNG plays a factor as well. Recommended at 3-4 players as it is beneficial to team up if someone is getting too far ahead. Rulebook is a bit lacking in explaining some of the minutia of different card combinations. I love the different map setups.

I wanted to enjoy Quantum... I really did. It has a space theme and dice: two of my favorite things! And yet, it didn't convince me. Despite the upgrade cards and ship abilities, the luck factor is still too high in battles, which means that even though you have a winning strategy, you can still lose the game by rolling poorly. The game has all the elements to make it potentially great, but unfortunately it fell a little flat for me.

Space combat quick play 4X for domination and area control on modular board planetary configurations using dice ship placement. Research upgrades for tech tree and special action cards. It's a space race to deploy Quantum cubes on the planets which allow you to expand your fleet. Part of strategy is knowing when to transform a ship by re-rolling its dice value and building combos of ships within the fleet. The clever part of the game is the balance and tradeoffs between the different six-sider value ship types with their special power, movement rate, and attack strength.

Favourite game. At it's very core, there is a chess mechanic that is kept fresh with a random element. An ever-changing puzzle presents itself with each turn, and battle system offers a social element that can and will turn the tides of the game. A large deck of cards that change the rules for each individual player (a la Cosmic Encounter) allows for high replay ability.

Roll your way though a modular galaxy in this tight 4Xish puzzle like game that really only is an hour long.

This boardgame with very few rules achieves to create a different story each time.
The playing is rather short, but it is perfect for 2 plays in a row.
I strongly recommand it.

Small space conquest game that seems like it should be shorter than it is. My one three-player game was marred by imprecisely written special powers on the cards and a tedious tit-for-tat endgame. We all wanted the game to be over in half the time.

Really liked this one the first time I played it. 

But when I tried again at a higher player count it just felt a bit...off.

I haven't adjusted my initial rating yet as I'd like to get in some more plays, but I'm a bit torn on how I feel about this one at the moment, possibly going to get traded away.

-- Seems better as a two player, but we already have two player games that we prefer. Sold

**First play rating**
2p learning game, wasn't really into the mechanics or the way the game presented itself.  Wouldn't turn down a 3/4p game to see if it made me feel and think otherwise.

**Later plays and rating** - Wife isn't a big fan of this but it scratches some itches for me:  combos, dice chuck, card play.   Great game at all player counts I think

**Upd nov16** - Wasn't a big hit w/friends.  Wife still dislikes it and admitted it is the excessive confrontation.  Was odd to hear but thoughts are hers and understood.  May end up sending this one out for someone else to enjoy.

**Update** gifted this to brother in law.

Not for trade ever.

So simple in execution. So tactically delicious. The dice represent ships that can "morph" into 6 different varieties, with each variety having their own set of powers. Great two player game. Looking forward to playing with more. After a few more plays, this has become one of my favorites. A deceptively quick game filled with so many tense decisions.

I don't think this is a bad game, but just not my style of play. It feels very slow, and is one that's subject to a good amount of analysis paralysis. There are a lot of options and I like some of the novel mechanics present here, but after some time spent with Quantum, I just don't feel like I need to go back. Good game for the think-y players but just not my style at all.

Wonderful game!
After watching the Watch It Played playthrough, I was expecting a good game, but when I played it I was really impressed! It has strategy, planning, luck, powers that you can buy and it is relatively quick to play.
This is a really, really nice game with great components and a lot of re-playability. Happy to have it in my collection.

A great deceptively simple strategy.  While it is essentially an abstract game though, it has a theme that is actually decently thought through.  
The game can be quite random - enough so that it might be off-putting for some.  Pick the right upgrade card early (say, "you get to re-roll" for instance) and a player might run away to the finish line.  
But, if you don't mind the occupationally imbalanced gameplay, you'll be rewarded with the smooth mechanics and satisfaction derived from a perfectly planned turn.

[b]2-player[/b] — [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] As a 2-player game, I have to say that this is a really interesting, lateral thinking game.  The action is fast enough that if you get beaten down, and nothing goes your way, it's over quickly; however, between the bend-the-rules cards, of which you can accumulate three, and the one-shot gambit cards, not to mention the clever ways you can use the ship dice themselves, it takes more than a bad skirmish to keep a player down.

I suspect that the attacking aspect of the game would make me not enjoy it with more than 2 players, but I'm peculiar that way — and I could be wrong:  I though the rules were interesting, but I certainly didn't expect to enjoy the game as much as I did (with 2).  I think plenty of people would eat this up, though.

Oh, yeah, and the dice and boards are [b]huge[/b].  I assumed they were standard-size dice, and the boards sized accordingly.

One of the things I love about this game is that it uses [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing]'s notion that the goal of the game is to get all of your palaces / Quantum Cubes constructed, no matter what other fun distractions there are along the way.  Unlike that favorite, though, this game gives you two ways to do that, one of which is direct conflict.  In a two-player game, I have very little problem with this, and it's an interesting strategic option!  A notable difference/similarity between Maharaja palaces and Quantum Cubes is that Quantum Cubes also serve as deployment centers (Aspects of this game felt just a little like [thing=35256]Caledea[/thing], with its own odd charm); however, in Maharaja, your objective structures can heavily influence receiving greater income, should the maharaja be enticed to revisit their location.

So wish this played 5, though I'm looking at a hack to make it work with 5 and even bought purple dice and cubes to allow for a 5th player. 

But this must be one of the most overlooked games and is loads of fun every time it comes to the table.

A great miniaturization of the big 4X Space games that fills the void in about an hour. The game is tight, tactical and has a good balance between strategy and luck.

I also love the fact the command cards feel powerful, yet still balance out with the rest of the game.

I did get a set with the messed up dice, but I've sent a message Passport Games and am hoping to get a new set of dice soon. If you run into the same problem check this out for more information

EDIT: I did get my replacement dice for Quantum, and am very happy with the game. The dice I received weren't translucent, but they are much better quality and actually makes the die rolls random.

RATING: 9
After one play I'm hooked.  A fantastic modification of the CC:E system.

RATING: 9
A more tightly designed and more immediately intense game than Combat Commander: Europe, which is a bit of a let down, since, while I prefer the setting and cast of the European theater more, I'd much rather play CC Pacific. 

Wish there were a way to port the new rules over, but it'd take a complete redesign of the all the European nations' decks :-(

The excellent rule additions and changes from CC:Europe make this different enough to justify owning both. I love it, but since it is the most rules-heavy of them, I would rather introduce new players to CC:E first, and then this later on.

We played all scenarios and the New Guinea expansion several times. Then, We use the scenarios generator to create more nightmares in the jungle!

The same epic system this time adapted to the Pacific warfare.

As in reality, the japonese faction have lots of nasty, unpleasant and cruel surprises!

I still prefer the Europe saga.

The best squad-level wargame series. And all expansions are good.
I just think that Combat Commander Europe is the better of the two due to the higher chaos generated by more events on the european sibling.

One thing that I really didn't like about the rules revision of CC Pacific was the Asset Denied Order. Didn't make much sense from an infantry combat perspective in my opinion.

But otherwise, a very fine game.

Has smoother rules and less unusable cards than CC:E. The Japanese play very differently than the Germans or Russians from CC:E.

Milsim special 4/2010.

Initial review:
-Components. Improvements with heavier gauge box, cards and  
matt rather than glossy rules book. Maps provide an interesting variety of terrain to test your skills.
-National characteristics. Japanese have infiltrate and bonus for close combat, very similar to ASL...this can only be a good thing.

Initial Impression: This game is similar to it's Europe counterpart in mechanisms. I haven't experienced the game well enough to know whether Pacific adds many more rules/complexity. The Japanese seem to play differently from the Germans and Americans, with their ambush tactics giving them advantages in melee combat. I have to admit that so far I'm not warming up to this system as I feel the cardplay is too random for my tastes.

I haven't really played this enough (too much CC:E and expansions to get through). Less 'random' than CC:E but I don't like the fact you can break (and then potentially eliminate) an opponents weapon with play of a card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not happy with some of the changes made to the game. 

The Asset Denied card is particularly irritating - I have an opponent who always makes sure he had two of these in his hand before using them, insuring that he can eliminate his opponent's most important asset in one strike. 

I find this precision ironic in a game that is supposed to be about chaos.

On the other hand, it is a well produced game with clear, concise rules and excellent graphics.

RATING: 8
This seems like the vast majority of the things I like in wargames and gmaes in general. I have always enjoyed card-driven wargames and the ammount of scope GMT packed into the cards is incredible. It improves over most CDGs by killing cards t dice rolls and events to add to the 'fog-of-war' and potentially robbing a commander of useful actions.

Really love the combat commander series but this may be my least favorite. There is just enough fiddly changes to the rules to take what has become so intuitive and make me look up rules way too often. Europe and med just play faster and easier. Love the theatre but wished they would've just stuck with europes ruleset. Still a fun game but the differences in the rules bring this version down a couple of notches. Too bad.

February 2007: This one's in the last throes of the design stage (though we have pushed pieces around a half dozen times in first-draft sessions). So far CC:P is shaping up to be my favorite in the Combat Commander series -- sort of an "advanced" Combat Commander: Europe.

Update 11 May 2007: Design finished. Internal playtesting begins.

Update 18 June 2007: Scenario (and map) design begins.

Update 21 October 2007: Now available for preorder on the GMT Games website! Order early and often. ;)

Update 2 February 2008: All twelve scenarios and maps now finished. Final playtesting begins.

Update 8 May 2008 UPDATE: Tentative release date of September '08. Only thing left to do is lay out the last of the Examples of Play and write the Design/Development notes. Playtesting continues in earnest on the scenarios in order to test for balance and outlier issues. New mechanics such as Banzai, Caves, Infiltration, etc. still receiving heavy scrutiny to try and weed out any potential problem.

Update 21 May 2008: Release date pushed back to December of '08. Shortage of graphic artists the apparent culprit.

Update 18 August 2008: Final artwork underway. Should be heading to the printers next month. Release date still holding at December 2008.

Update 1 December 2008: UPS just delivered my advance copies. Very nice print job all around. You guys are going to like this one. Very soon, now....

Update 12 December 2008: Delivery to preorder customers begins. Huzzah!

Not sure when, or even if this will ever get played but I really wanted to pick up a copy while it was still in print.

UPDATE: Finally managed to get this to the table and both Rudeboy and myself thoroughly enjoyed it. Hoping it comes out again soon.

UPDATE 2.0: Reluctantly listed on Ebay after the last play. If this game doesn't get played regularly it's simply impossible to keep on top of the multiple rule lookups that are required on each play. The 'flow' of the game is disturbed a great deal and it detaches you from the action happening on the board. Although I love war games it looks like this may be the last one I buy, as I don't feel like I have an opponent that's enthusiastic enough to try them out with me. Oh well!

The differences with the Europe game are fairly subtle, but are all improvements in my estimation.  I'd like to play through all of the scenarios here, and my impression is that a few of them are tricky, but I don't see a problem with that.

This game system with the production value GMT brings to it, its a winner. I've tried a few other squad-based WWII games, but Combat Commander is the most fun to play.  It may not be the best simulation. It may introduce more chaos than average. There may be times when the cards and objectives dictate no-win game situations. But overall, the cards reveal a riveting narrative and no two games play out the same. 

I'm waiting on some CC:P expansions now. We need aircraft carriers!

It's OK, but not something I'm going to buy.  To much luck for me, which is not the same as "chaos of battle" that everyone says it has -- I particularly get turned off by the way victory conditions can change through the random introduction of objectives.  And the Op/Fire is just way to powerful -- unless, that is, you're not lucky enough to have a Fire card to play...

I like the Pacific side of Combat Commander better. The rules are a bit different than the European modules. I think there is less luck and when you destroy a position so soldiers can not come back alive. The Scenario Builder module is very powerful and you can build new scenarios within minutes and the chances are very good that you will have a good game. NEEDS a Burma battlepack.

Great game.  Has some great strategy elements and the cards to help simulate the 'fog of war'.  Rule book is good, but does require some time to learn.  My copy came with one surrender counter, but after reading the rules I learned that the Japanese don't surrender (so one counter).  If you can find it at a good price, it is well worth it.

The Combat Commander series may be the greatest war game system I've ever played.  Now I've been playing since 1970s and I've lots of systems, but this system just knocks play out of the park.  When I retire in a few years, this and Europe are games I'm going to keep.  If you want to play solitaire, try StukaJoes CDG (card drive games) solitaire system - it works great with these games.  To learn about the game check out Harsh Rules: Board Game Tutorials for Combat Commander Europe (same system) on YouTube.com.  

Back the GMT P500 system if the game is currently out of print.  You have lots of games that still need to be played - so give those some table time (love) while you wait. :-)

The core mechanism is order cards that one gets randomly from their own deck. You don't know what orders your opponent has or which ones you'll get next turn, so you're always feeling vulnerable. You might not be able to do something effectively or even at all if you don’t have the right cards. The result is both good (the tension of the uncertainty) and bad (a lot of hand cycling where you’re both fishing your respective decks for cards to move or fire). 

The game is supposedly inspired by Up Front which is the game I’d prefer to play before this one. Perhaps after I explore Up Front I’ll revisit this one and appreciate what the design is going for.

Combat Commander is my absolute favorite two player wargame. 
 
I have played and owned all the big tactical wargames for WW II out there.

To me the other big contenders out there feel clinical and chess-like in comparison.

Probably the best of the Combat Commanders.  The reason is the slightly improved deck mechanics.  The uniqueness of the Japanese Army can be debilitating sometimes but on the whole it's a very good system that is easily taught to others.

Every game I've played of Combat Commander (both Pacific, and Europe) has been balanced and nail bitingly close! The rules are simple and easy to reference. A lot play testing went into this game. The random events always seem to balanace things out. Being a fan of ASL I never thought I would like that idea, but it works in this game. Because of it ease of complexity, fun, and tactics involved, this is my new go-to game.

RATING: 5
Adapting to the new rules and decks.

I must confess that I feel hesitant about this one. There are lots of nice ideas to like but new orders such as Charge, Revive or Asset Denied seem to work against the very basis of the narrative.

In any case, I need to play more before making any further judgements.
-------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: The more I play, the more frustrated I feel.

I might be me not adapting well to the new rules and strategic options, but this game seems to lack much of the tension that CC:E/Med delivers in spades.

It's true that the Japs feel really different from other nations in the system and thus are fun to play. But both the US and Commonwealth feel incredibly boring: They just have to set up fire group after fire group to use all the Enfilade and Markmanship actions that they can and wipe out the enemy from the map.

No need to adapt to random events as very few them take place, what makes card management much simpler (very few useful cards get inadvertently burnt) and also makes for much longer games (as there are much fewer chances for Time! triggers to happen and the decks take forever to get exhausted).

I also miss the broader variety of actions that you have in CC:E/Med: Assault Fire, Concealment, Spray Fire, Smoke Grenades, Dig In. Most actions in CC:P just seem to be fire or melée bonuses and that's it.

Last but not least I am definately disappointed with the Charge, Revive and Asset Denied orders, as they add way too much "design for effect" for my taste.

All in all, CC:P has some nice ideas but feels similar to other tactical systems where the players are more "under control" of everything and can more easily foresee what's going to happen next.

IMHO, CC:E/Med is a more unique kind of game and much deeper than this one.

Traded away.

An interesting twist on the Combat Commander system.  The game feels a bit less random than CC:E, although I'm not yet sure whether that is just an illusion.  The Asset denied rules are a bit odd.  The rules allow play of an asset denied card to, for example, call for the hand of God to come down and smite the enemy's machine gun so that your squads can run to cover across an open area unhindered by nasty bullets.  On the other hand, from a game play perspective it is a cool tactical tool; it just doesn't have the right feel for me.  Maybe it should be viewed as some kind of suppression fire.  Regardless of the asset denied weirdness, CC: P has been a lot of fun to play.

Which tactical systems will survive for me in the coming year? I'm not sure, but I'll be looking at fun and game play...which ones speak to me more will live.

One major advantage for these Combat Commander games: The scenario generator. That gives these things major legs and is something I love.

Really enjoyed the play of scenario A, although I managed to lead the Japanese to Defeat, it was a close call.
Very much looking forward to playing again.
**Update** Scenario B done now - had to re-learn the rules though due to a long gap between plays. Managed to eek out a win, but rules errors on my part mean that the game was somewhat meaningless.

*Update Oct 09*
This hasn't hit the table in a little while, but I may teach to a friend and see how it goes. This is probably a factor or there being so many other great games out there to play right now. Still enjoy this one.

RATING: 7
After two plays, I find myself in complete agreement with David DesJardins' comments (as of 6/1/09), in which he rates the game a 7 and critiques the Revive and Asset Denied cards. I find both of them too gamey and less interesting than the Rally order and Jammed! trigger. With the Japanese hordes charging my Allied position, I also feel the want of a Rout order, but the elimination of that seems more thoughtful and less like an overreaction to criticism, such as it was, that Europe and Med were too luck based and chaotic. The Time trigger in Pacific, being less involved, also feels less dramatic; I'm not sure whether that's good or bad yet.

The Japanese play style is going to take some getting used to--at least I haven't dealt with it very effectively yet as a foe. I'm a little concerned that the Japanese deck and tactics raise the importance of the leader to an overly high level, something that was already a danger in Europe/Med. While the Charge order can move lots of guys in the Banzai posture, it still seems like the human wave aspect employed in, say, scenario C is going to be hard to pull off if the leaders are killed, making the leaders obvious targets even when nearer targets would make more on-the-field sense, I'd think. The basic anti-Japanese strategy seems to be to stop them before they get close, because if they get close they're going to rip you apart in melee; the problem here, at least for me and my crappy wargame skills, is that marshaling enough firepower to break, let alone kill, these high-morale units is difficult, especially when they sweep down on you in large numbers. The change to allowing outright kills of units is good in theory but hasn't come into play in my first two games. Shit, maybe I just need to be a better player. I still have trouble remembering how to add up the fire groups' and melee attack values.

I don't think adding airplanes to squad games like this makes much sense. Though it's not quite the nightmare that the Memoir air pack adds to that game, the plane rules here still end up clogging things up and creating some odd situations with planes "hovering," waiting for an order.

The bottom line is that if you like Europe and Med, you'll probably like this roughly equally well; you may like it somewhat better or less, given your interest in the theater and given your response to the rules changes, but nothing's dramatically different here. Pacific is probably a quarter-step more complex than Europe/Med, but probably not so much that a CC novice couldn't start there.

I prefer CC:E/M. I like Pacific, but there are some cards too strong IMO (asset denied) and is much more limited compared to the others... still a nice game, and adds some new rules which are really fun.

I like it less than the Europe version, becuse the event die roll triggers have been moved from 7's to 5's, which decreases the randomness I enjoy so much in the original game.  I do like a few of the rule tweaks, though, such as decreasing cover for overstacked hexes.  Still a great game.

Flavorful, but I think it needs a few house rules.  The number of "die rolls" is reduced from CC:E, and because those rolls trigger turn advances, the game takes longer.  Maybe "roll the dice" after discards.  Also there needs to be a limitation on the Asset Denied Card.  Otherwise, the game can generate into a "take that" infliction of jams on each other's machine guns.

The perfect marriage of cards and a tactical game. I loved CCE, but CCP takes the lessons learned from that game and pares down a few rules. It makes for a leaner, less luck dependent exciting tactical game that is a classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial rating based on solitaire play.

CC:P improves upon the basic mechanics of CC:E by eliminating some of the more useless orders in CC:E and replacing them with more interesting ones.  The Japanese can "infiltrate", both sides get aircraft and night fighting is modelled easily.

Chaos is ever present, as it is in CC:E.  There are times when your attack is stalled because you cant get the move or advance card you need (there are plenty of fire cards in CC:P).  However, the tension is incredible and the leader in victory points can swing suddenly based on the outcome of a melee in an objective hex.  That, combined with the uncertainty of the game end due to the sudden death mechanic, makes CC:P a joy to play.

I look forward to future expansions of this game.

I like CC: Pacific better than CC:E and CC:M. There is no Rout command and Recover has been replaced with the new Revive order, which means there are no morale checks during the game and this gives much smoother gameplay. I also find Actions to be far more useful. The hex-side terrain like fences is gone, which again simplifies game a bit. I feel the game is slightly less random than Europe and Mediterranean.

If there's anything I don't like in CC: Pacific this would be terrain, which IMO is more fun in Europe and Mediterranean. This is mostly because terrain in Pacific is jungle, swamps, bushes and so on and it makes the game more difficult (high MP cost, large hindrances).

After some more plays I get a felling that there are many scenarios where one side just sits in one place and shots the enemy.

The basic game is a solid good gaming system.  So this complete new game on the Pacific theatre should be for those who likes the original.  A real threat to ASL system, though I think this system is rather constricted, mainly by the pre-designated no. and types of cards each national force has and the cards that are in your hand during an impulse, as to the development of a good tactical story as compared to ASL or Lock n' Load. BGG Golden Award Best Wargame 2009. (Note: I have been resisting the urge to buy yet another Combat Commanders in the series but finally succumb to it in GMT fire sale.  The game has been staying on the third in the wargame rank for a long time only after Twilight Struggle and Paths of Glory.  It must have been done right.)

RATING: 7
Similar to Up Front in both the positive and negative.  An impressive feat, and twelve scenarios are a solid number, especially since each gets its own map.  (This sort of counteracts the obvious main loss compared to Up Front - the flexible terrain.) The limited map area exacerbates the effect.  It's strange at first that the map area is limited enough for an MG to shoot right across without any loss in effectiveness, and were LMG's really limited to 250m effective range?  Some fudging in evidence here, I guess.

Maps are nice (although the park-like ambience of the New Guinea scenarios conveyed by standard GMT graphics is rather funny).  I really like the thoughtful counter design.

The rules unfortunately show that GMT (or at least someone there) has learned nothing from the Prussia's Glory disaster. A ten-page pile of introductory detail, much of which can't be assembled and would be forgotten anyway, before one even gets to see the sequence of play, results in a rulebook that is long, repetitive (they tell you twice in those ten pages what "range" means), and difficult to use both for learning and as a reference.  

Overall, play is certainly random, with card availability being a big factor in any scenario, but, well, that's just Up Front.  However, some bits are plain weird (such as the fact that the Japanese only jump into their hidden and camouflaged bunkers [i]after[/i] you've had a chance to shoot them up), and some are plain annoying.  The "Finger of God" effect that breaks any gun of choice just by pointing an Asset Denied card at it (which means it's always the big guns that break first, regardless of rate of use) is the worst. It even comes with the possibility of double play, removing the weapon without chance of the owner repairing it.  It's cost me one opponent already and we'll fix it by some houserule (possibly only permitting play on a weapon that has  fired in the previous turn).

I've resisted the urge to rate the game lower to counteract the rather distasteful 10-boosting by the designer's crew. Wargame rank 1? Well, perhaps in shilling.

very very good, it could have reached easily 9 if not... too few scenarios and a bit unwieldy to move back and forth.

Revised rating: in my opinion the card system while clever does not work in the tactical setting. It become quickly boring. I understand the intent of the designer but the execution is not something I like. Decisions made by the designers are in some case plain wrong. No Bazooka? Ok no bunker busting weaponry. No tanks? Ok setting aside the fact the in the pacific battles engagement range (even Tank vs Tank) were quite short means no corkscrew and blowtorch tactics. I cannot have 37mm At gun firing canister, but I have 25 pdr and bomber... yawn.

Like a lot of smaller scenario games, can be very fragile. However, when it doesn't get too wacky it can be a great game. Certainly I think it does a better job of representing the chaos of the battlefield than a lot of the hex/counter games, where players have too much control.
CC: P is by far the best of the series. However, the Banzai Charge doesn't exactly evoke the perception of a banzai attack, as the units advance in one turn and then stop. Not what one expects.

The rules changes mean that you need to refer back to the rules book at times, but they work for this theater.  There is definitely a lot in the box and as usual, it's up to GMT's high standards.  Hopefully more maps and scenarios for this theater will continue to be produced.

RATING: 9.5
In the end, given my love of CC, I had to get this as well, even if it is not a theater I get too excited about.

After a few games, also find it a lot of fun.  the Banzai status is just frightening.

7/2017:  Just played a lightning fast game of scenario F.  The clock flew past!  Really enjoy this incarnation of the game as well, even if not as much as Europe, but the different decks feel different with their own quirks to learn and adapt to.

Same as CC-E but with a Pacific flavour and some added chrome.  I think I like the original better ... but will have to play a lot more to be sure.
I guess the rules changes (Pacific Version) have improved the game ... but I thought the old rules were pretty good ...so I'm now torn whether to play the different rule versions for each game??

When I first played CC: Europe way back, I wasn't a fan. Years later, I gave the system another try along with having a new expectation of what the system is trying to do and I now love it. CC: Pacific is a great advancement of the system. The rules tweaks gives CC: Pacific a different feel and the action is tense. Also, I don't miss armored vehicles since the Pacific land campaign was mainly an infantry slog. The rules are extremely well written.

From a Memoir '44 fan perspective: Your turn is dictated by your cards in hand. You play a number of cards each turn and they generally allow you to action a unit to either move or fire, but not both in one turn. You're trying to huddle your men around your leader chits, because if you activate the leader unit, all the units around him are actioned as well. If you can get all those units in range and line of sight, then you maximise your firepower on individual targets to maximise your chances of elimination, which you get VP's for (and an instant win if you eliminate enough units). Defense value is typically double attack values, so getting everyone firing together is essential, and then you randomly add a double dice roll which, given the start values might be in the 8-10 range, and usually fairly evenly matched, can turn a lot of combats into a bit of a lottery. There's lot's of chrome for attacks - weapons, terrain hindrances, terrain defense, line of sight - which can be painful, and some weird stuff in that being 2 hexes away is equivalant to being 6 away in terms of accuracy. There's lots of random chrome events as well - aircraft, smoke, blazes. Lots and lots of rules so that anything and everything it seems can happen. Great for those who want to master it, get all the nuance and be immersed for an evening. This game's for you. Both games are about setting up to maximise the chances of success and then managing the randomness. But when all's said and done, for gamers like myself who don't care so much about the nuance, M44 with all the expansion stuff has much the same chrome effects for little rule learning effort, easier setup, faster games, same card luck, same combat resolution luck, but easier to pick up and play and ... more fun for the time investment.

After several hours of rules reading we finally got our game in.  Yes it was worth the effort.  CC is a tactical wargame played on the very intimate level.  The board itself represents about 1500 ft of terrain.  A typical scenario consists of around 30-50 men on each side.  Play is card driven, everything from orders for your units to the dice rolls themselves are all card based.  The game seems like it has a lot of play balancing built in.  While our first game was a lopsided victory, we felt it was more the choices taken and not the game play itself.  We are looking forward to getting another game in.  Be warned we spent about 4 hours reading rules before we played and another 5 hours for our first game.  However I'm confident our name scenario will be more in line with the 2-3 hour recommend range.

Combat Commander uses cards to acquire orders so you can do something in the game.  A unique concept but I found it doesn't really work that well. 

The designers say this game is not based on reality as much as it is based on play ability. That is very true.  Lots of things in the game end up making no sense as to why they are happening.  So that is just bizarre for a war game. I play a lot of games using cards and non are as strange as this one.

I also found it very frustrating in that I didn't get an order that any normal combat situation would dictate that it could happen.  But I can't make it happen because the cards didn't come up to be able to do the obvious normal order that one would do.  

The game felt like a card game of limited actions wrapped with the disguise of a combat game with a lot of frustration and down right stupid things coming up.  

A 6 is a generous evaluation based mostly on art work, well written rules, and a lot of additions to the game.

Substantive changes/updates to reflect the Pacific theater. The infiltration rules for the Japanese add a lot of variety and depth but not a lot of overhead. The Sogeki Hei (Japanese sniper) is deadly--maybe too much so. Slight procedure modification to melee combat--all are resolve at the beginning of the Allied player's turn. That, along with relaxed stacking limits and deck changes, force some adjustments to strategy. A big negative is your ability to break an opponent's weapons--very gamey. Overall, I prefer CC: Europe, but will never turn down a game of Pacific.

The first tactical combat game I really really like! I've tried First Battle and ASL, but this is it.
I was very sceptical in the first place but I am truly convinced about the design of this game.
I am pretty sure that ASL gamers will not be satisfied with the complexity of the game and the limits put on the gamer by the cards. For the occasional tactical combat wargamer or the newbie this system is perfect. It renders nicely the squad level combat without going into the last little detail. It is not simplistic, by no means! It's just very well done and access is easy.

First Impressions of the game:

Like all GMT games all the materials for this game were well made and well put together. 

This game is my first exposure to the Combat Commander system. After given the rules a read through and looking at the forum posts on BGG I set the game up for a solitaire play of the first scenario, “The Grassy Knoll”. I had to dig around a bit and reread some of the sections of the rules to make sure that I had the basics down, but any familiarity with war games will allow for a quick grasp of core concepts. 

Each side has a Fate deck of about 73 cards that are the primary engine for the game. Like most card driven games the cards are used to give orders to your forces on the map, but unlike other card games I have played they also do much more. The cards are used both as a mechanism for dice rolling, as well as adding events and actions into the players turn. The cards also provide some random triggers into the game as well. For instance the Time track is only advanced when by flipping a card to make a die roll it has TIME written above the printed Die roll. 
At first I was skeptical about playing through the whole deck and how this system would work. I found in playing that the players burn through the deck fairly quickly. I also really enjoyed the card triggers and events that playing cards created. I completely burned through the both the Japanese and the American Fate decks before I even advanced the time track one space. I found the randomness of the time to be a very interesting device in playing the game. I can see the potential for some wonky results if the deck were to go against the players, but so far I think its strength’s outweigh its possible weaknesses. I am sure that for the experienced player there is more of an element of deck management, particularly when one had played the same side enough to become familiar with the deck. 

Game flow and mechanics are pretty interesting as well. As I was playing this scenario I could easily see the actions of what was going on with the pieces on the map written into a combat fire fight narrative. I have never really been that interested in the Pacific theater as a game setting, but this game I think captures jungle combat very well. The nature of the passage of time, the short sharp fights at close range as well as units moving across the map and stumbling into wire, trenches, enemy units etc. I had a blast playing this game solo and can’t wait to further explore it. I was both elated and pissed when a blaze popped up on one of the objective spots denying it to the Americans. 

This brings me to another interesting part of the game, objectives. The random generation of victory points for the scenarios was another element that I wasn’t sure about going into the game, but then found that I enjoyed. Also the secret objectives can really change the game. Playing solo and seeing each side’s secret objective point values I could see how the two players can be fighting to very different battles against each other. I think this coupled with the deck system will make for a very high re-playability with the scenarios. 

Overall as an initial impression I enjoy this game and see a lot of potential in it. 

****NOTE: I missed the rule that the time marker should be advanced when the deck is exhausted. This would have meant that Time segment one was long and 2 and 3 completed in rapid fire sequence.

RATING: 9
Is it possible to take an idea such as [GameID=21050] and squeeze something different out of it?  Yes, it is, and this game proves it in my mind.  The genesis of the CC system is clearly seen, but the differences (easily summarized on 1 page of the rules) all combine to make a fluid game that works perfectly for the Pacific theater.  Cards flow through hands more quickly here, the fighting here is a bit closer and a bit bloodier compared to CC:E.  A great addition to the system if you have CC:E and its ilk.

Both CC:E and CC: Pac are good starting points - if you want to start with one - choose the theater that interests you.

Fiddly and pointless. I could deal with the fiddliness, but not with the pointlessness. 

Between cover and leader bonuses, you need to concentrate a significant fire group to consistently damage a unit. A revive order completely nullifies the damage to several units. The net outcome of these two effects is to force you to hold at least one revive order, and concentrate fire on one unit until it is dead. The events sound cool, but often whiff, and do nothing when they are triggered. The orders end up being awkward, and detract from the game play. If you don't have any of the orders you need, you can't do anything for the turn, and this can persist for multiple turns if you are unlucky.

Great addition to the series.

As an aspiring ten-year-old grognard I always thought the Pacific theater was way more interesting.  Maybe it was the fact that my grandfather had fought at Okinawa, or maybe I just preferred palm trees and coral reefs.  It does, however, seem difficult to make a really good Pacific game.

CC: Pacific does it.  I already love the CC system, and the tweaks here do a great job evoking the theater, especially the way the tropical terrain often forces fights into uncomfortably close quarters.  I only wish I could play this more often.

A stand-alone game using the same system as Comcast Commander: Europe. Factions include the Japanese, the Pacific US (basically, the marines), and troops from India/ANZAC.

A great looking game system from my favorite war game company GMT.  I love card driven war games and I like the looks of this one.  The complexity may be its only detractor for me.  I don't know how often I would actually get to play it.

Tightens up the system in CC: Europe for a much more deliberate, strategic game. The factions feel very different. It's a little too easy to rally the one unit you want to rally, which I like, but some of my friends don't.

Tried playing this again with Kelly but we decided it is too long for what we want to play together. Also a bit more fiddley than I remember.

I was looking for something longer, more complex, and generally "meatier" than M44 but without a 7-day gameplay time and slide rules / LOS spreadsheets.  This game hit that sweet spot dead on.

The card driven actions drive the gameplay and tactics in a challenging way, and the "dice rolls" on the cards enforce a slight reduction in dice luck due to the perfect distribution on the cards (although the cards will not all be drawn for dice rolls).  Anyway, brilliant mechanic IMHO.

My copy was missing a card and GMT immediately sent a replacement, GMT is a great company.

First game (solo) literally took me from about 6pm (though with about a 20 min interruption) to 1:40am. (Though this was me playing with only having a slight grasp of the rules and how everything actually flows and plays out.) Amazing game, but I am very tired.
Played second game and it only took a little over 2 hours! Yeah! 
After about 5 plays solo I can say this is easily in my top 3 (tied for 3rd.)
Rating game a 9.4 based purely on solo plays. (1/12/14)

Rated it an eight after one play. There is a lot to this game. The mechanics are very cool. I like the uncertainty with the event cards. Would definately play again. With more plays I think this game could go higher.

I'm not as much a fan of the Pacific ops than the European and Med theaters.  Still, this is a great system and used well with the challenges specific to the Pacific tactics.

CC-P: The more I played it, the more I liked it. But the last scenarios, especially those we've created with the random scenario generator, appeared quite unbalanced. And after having played all CC-P scenarios now, I think CC-P has far more unpredictable results than CC-E. 

For comments on the CC-system itself, see: Combat Commander Europe 

Until 2015-06-15: 179 plays (all scenarios and campaigns of all CC-games, CC-modules, C3I magazines and CC-Tournaments altogether)

Nice game. Like the others in the series, this is a well thought out, easy to learn and play game. The rules are easy to absorb, and after a couple games seem second nature.

Like this one even more than CC:E because you don't miss the tanks since armor didn't play a big role in the Pac

CC: Pacific was clean, played smoothly, and created a narrative. However the card-play, married to a hexagonal map I find difficult to accept. Prefer AH's Up Front or Fighting Formations.

This has been detached and trayed but barely played. 

I'm looking to swap/trade it for Mediterranean .. I've realised I've absolutely no interest in playing the Pacific.

Edit: This is now off my trade list. despite the comment above I kepted getting unsuitable offers (ie. everything except Med).

Denostado injustamente por algunos ortodoxos del CC:E. Probadlo sin prejuicios ni comparaciones y el juego os dará diversión a raudales. Un juego de diez.

I've recently started playing this after several sessions of CC: Europe, and my opponent and I have found that we enjoy it just as much.

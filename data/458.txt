One particularly clunky rule about certain cards - that make sense thematically - but really need to be house ruled to stop the game from dragging on and on and on. Once house ruled, it's a solid "safe" card game - nothing too much going on, but fun if you're in the mood.

RATING: 6
Centenary edition no less.  

You'll get more out of this if you're a Holmes fan as the original illustrations are lovingly (and thematically) reproduced and there's a slight story telling element to the card play.  Truth be told though the major attraction is landing one of your opponents with a major villain before arresting him - scoring lots of (bad) points for him and hopefully reducing your own score.  

While there's some light decision making, the opportunities to score are mainly down to making the most of the card draw and if you can live with that you can have a good time; just don't come in expecting a heavier game or one involving much deduction.

Not a bad game. Reasonably thematic but it dragged on a bit too much for my liking. Probably playing over 3 or 4 rounds would have suited me better than 6. And a visual aid to keep track of where you are in the setting should have been included in the game. Based on 1 play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game was dreadful. There is absolutely no tactical decisions (any of them are destroyed by the utterly stupid Thick Fog cards that completely mess up everybody's hand) and I see almost no way to win as a villain (good luck if you have an Arrest and a Villain in hand; you'll have to either play the Arrest, probably failing to uncover a villain and gaining more cards and making it more difficult to shed or somehow passing it on (and why wouldn't you pass the Villain so you know who to accuse). Clues are worthless if Thick Fog is played, and the game end feels entirely arbitrary. I wouldn't touch this with a 10-foot pole.

Played this game for the first time quite a lot of years ago and as a great Sherlock Holmes fan, it was not hard for me to dive deep into the atmosphere of the enigmatic sleuth, Dr. Watson (his Boswell), Professor Moriarty, Inspector Lestrade and all those remarkable characters of the London where it will always be 1895. Not forgetting to mention the hansom cabs, the fog and the gaslit lanterns. 
Even the tactics and the game play turned out to be attractive. Sweet memories :)

Played a couple of times - don't really get it. No much scope to glean information about other peoples hands before making accusations. And when I had seen a card in someone's hand, it was ages before the game reached a state where I was able to make an accusation.

This one normally comes out towards the end of the evening (early hours of the morning) when the concentration levels are dropping and folks feel ready for a relatively simple, follow the leader type of card game.  It is also good for new gamers and younger players as it has easy mechanics and only a few exception rules based on card order.

[2 plays] Both times I've played this it has been with 3 people, which I don't think is the ideal.  Fewer players makes it too easy to figure out who has the villain.  This has been an OK game, but I think it will be a lot better with more players.  I love the themelicious use of the original illustrations, and all the background info in the rules.

I'm sure we're playing this wrong. We tried this with three players. Once we got the hang of it (we think?), it was fairly straightforward but very simplistic & not as much fun as I'd hoped. I think this would do better with a bigger group of people to play with - 3 isn't really enough (as it's easy to work out who has the suspects).

Vinnies.

I didn't once think that I was playing that game, rather, that the game was dictating what I could do. There are so many limitations on what you can do, and not enough ways to reliably move cards around. There's also an advantage to going first, and there's nothing you can do if you get a bad hand except wait and hope everyone else has a bad hand too. The icing on the cake was that the game had split the deck into two packs for packaging, and once we shuffled them together, we quickly realised the two decks were printed on different sized cards. Awful.

I love this game its so simple. Shame the bad guys are on black card makes them easy to spot in someones hand even if you are trying not to look.

Just got the rules more or less straight after a play. The theme makes this I think. Otherwise it would be fiddly rummy. It looks like a lot of fun, though it must be very hard to sneak a villain out of your hand. Must try it next time...

Played 3+ Pleasant well themed card game. If the same group played regularly the play would probably flow better than it has in the games I have participated in. The need to keep pen and paper scores detracts from the fun. The length of time needed to play a series of games prohibits this game from getting played regularly. No sence of having to make any strategic decisions. Jan 04. UPDATE played again and I have been too kind on this one. I go with the "Pleasant well themed game" comment but it is not what I want to be playing with gamers. You will have to put an hour aside to play a meaningful number of games and there hundreds of better alternatives for that length of time. Dec 09

Some kind of UNO-variant made worse trying to force a theme to it. You follow suite and hope it doesn’t drag too long.

Artwork aside, I have barely anything good to say. Having more villains appear through the deck is something, at least, so even if you get that first one you have a real reason to accuse someone else. But it's an awful game in nearly every sense.

Unfortunately, this is one of our regulars and I just bite down and bear through. It is only some kind of filler, after all...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Horrible game. Almost Zero Strategy.

A game where you need to empty your hand with a few deduction to do.

Problem, The card previously played tells you what cards you are allowed to play and you cannot play more than 1 card every turn.

So you get in a situation when you cannot do long term planning or you cannot try to empty your hand by doing card combos.

I even had this situation that I knew who was the murderer but not only did I need a special card, I also needed that the card previously played allowed me to played that card. So the odds that it happens are pretty low.

So the cards played by the player create an artificial randomness that tells the player what they should do. Which mean that the player is not feeling like he is actually playing the game, the game is playing for him.

This is why it's bad and very annoying to play.

The theme of Sherlock Holmes is right on spot for me.  The game was reprinted by VPG in a smaller edition without score sheet. Otherwise, the game is easy to pick up among any group of players and the system is very fine adapted as deeper variation of UNO.

(Based on 1 game with 6 players 3 rounds) Last night our host's daughter was having trouble getting to sleep and crying for her bottle.  What the parents should of done was bring her down and let her play this game.  In ten minutes she would of been asleep.

The game works, it rewards good memory and card management, the roleplay element increases interactivity.  But lets draw the line.  There are thousands of games with these qualities and this one is a dull game from the past and should be eradicated from the world like polio and the TV series Crossroads.

RATING: 5
I got this game last Christmas (2015), but I didn't get it to the table until last night (June 2016) - largely because I hadn't been very enthused by it. It proved a foncusing experience - we thought from just reading the (very brief) rules that you could play any card of the types/colours listed on the previous card, but then later when checking the more detailed card descriptions on the reference card, it became apparent that there were further restrictions which were nowhere stated on the cards.

I'm not sure I see much future in this game - it's a bit rummy-like, and I guess with some deduction, but it doesn't seem all that interesting. But I expect we'll play it at least once more just to get more of a handle on the rules.

Played once (with 5 players). While the game might score a few points for a rather thin theme, there does not seem to be much more in it than a Uno variant. Card play is very limited by what the previous player played (not that he had any real control on it), some cards target a specific player who might not be the one you would have chosen, and if ever you managed to plan anything (although I am not sure how), the fog is here to redistribute all the cards and wreck your plans. The scoring system could have been interesting, if there had actually been some more control about how and when you play your cards.

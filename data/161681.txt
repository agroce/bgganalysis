I got to play a demo of this game at our weekly game night.  Very professional prototyping, and the rules were easy to follow.  We played a 5 player game which moved along very well.  I would highly recommend (and I backed the Kickstarter almost immediately)!

Nice family game, overall an enjoyable experience. Yet there's not too many interesting choices to make and I think there's no instance in which I wouldn't prefer to play 'Survive' instead, where there's just more going on and offers entertaining highs and lows almost every turn. But if 'Survive' is too cutthroat for you 'Lift off!' might be a goos alternative.

Good production, but the game is too fiddly and dull for my taste. Just felt like I was pulling handles in a pre-determined fashion. Nothing broken, but hardly inspiring. One for the ebay pile...

My son (7) liked the game because of the beautiful game board and the cool Garglore piece.

I am a fan of simple games, but there just isn't a lot of game here.  I feel like there are no real choices to be made during the game.  Movement is sort of pointless since all lift off points are equidistant.  There is probably an ideal set of lift off points for more "game", but I don't see that being enough to make the game anything more than an activity.

Based on 1 play with 5 players (using the suggested starting tiles):

I had high hopes for this as "the next Survive!" and while I can see its influences, this game does not come anywhere close to presenting the riotous, laughter-filled affair that is Survive. 

Put simply: there aren't enough ways to interact in this game. The lift off points ostensibly encourage some semi-cooperative gameplay, but these just end up feeling pretty straightforward. During our first game, everyone would zone out when it wasn't there turn and just wait for the "your turn" tap on the shoulder from the previous person in line; not the kind of behavior I usually associate with our boisterous group.

I like the race aspect and some of the more advanced lift off points seem interesting, so I'm sure we could have [i]more[/i] fun with this than we did... but as for it becoming the must-have gateway that I was hoping for I'd say the outlook isn't great.

Played several times now with different family members.  Surprisingly easy to teach.  Not a hard core strategy game but you can be a real jerk if you want to.  Mutual destruction?  Sure...if you do me wrong.

The idea is not bad. You can play like a cut-throat game, but the interaction between players is weak. I wish the coming expansion can improve the players' interaction.

The objective of Lift Off! Get Me Off This Planet! is to be the first player to get their Aliens off the planet using resource cards, action cards, and phases of the moon to escape. If the planet explodes before everyone escapes, the player with the most saved Aliens wins.

Family Gaming: This is a pretty good design for the family. I removed a couple cards that can slow the game down, and/or make the game swing heavily (electric storm). I feel the game sits nicely as a light weight family game with a modular board. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice light game for family fun. You can play competitively or cooperate with other players. The rule is easy to learn and the difficulty is adjustable by moving the sun counter up (closer to doom) for greater challenge.

There are several "lift off platforms" that you can use during the game, making the replay value high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun fast playing, if somewhat random little race game whereby you attempt to get your alien-eeple off the planet (in a variety of hilarious ways) before the next person.

Random card draw could be parts used to help get you off the planet or events that help you or hinder you opponents. 

fun family friendly filler game :)

RATING: 9
I played the pre-production version of this game with my son and a few other adults, and we had a great time. The artwork is beautiful, and the mechanic is really creative. Aside from a typical resource/worker theme, the moon phase adds another nice dynamic to the game that keeps it different and very re-playable. I'm happy to be one of the kickstarter backers, and eagerly looking forward to it funding and shipping.

SUMMARY: A FUN, MODERN BOARD GAME SUITABLE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.

DISCLOSURE: I'm old friends with the designer, and have beaten him at this game. That may or may not have been a masterful ploy to secure my enthusiastic support.

MY PERSPECTIVE: Avid videogamer and parent. Interested in board games, but experience has been chiefly in backgammon; plus contemporary classics such as Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. -- This may make my comment irrelevant for the majority of this site's readership (i.e., modern board game geeks!), but I'll leave it in case someone gets some mileage out of it.

MORE DETAIL: The board game is attractive & well made. The designer has incorporated thoughtful touches such as a recommend configuration for novices. -- Strategically, I enjoyed shifting between cooperation and competition. Tactically, each turn offered numerous options (governed by facts and/or luck). -- The fiction wrapped around the game is cheery (despite the grim premise). It's also comprehensive, e.g., the time (turn) limit feature is tied to the underlying story of the planet exploding.

PS - One minor possible tweak for version 2: Clarify the concept of changing moon phases, by making the intermediary one a crescent.

RATING: 5
Decent, light gateway game (of which there aren't many), so kudos for that. The game holds together well, and the addition of the Garglore adds just enough strategic possibility to flesh out the game without being overbearing. Replayability is also good with 10 different lift-off points to choose from.

I agree with other reviewers that other games, e.g. Survive! Escape from Atlantis or King of Tokyo, have more interesting choices for players to make, so how much this game makes it to the table probably depends quite a bit on the group's interest in the theme and/or the time they have available.

Note, cards really should be drawn at the end of your turn rather than the beginning to slightly reduce downtime and allow for some planning while waiting for others' turns. Also, movement of your aliens seems a bit extraneous, though one player in our game used it to move two aliens to the surface so that they could then be directed in a single turn to one of the lift-off points depending on the phase of the moon (the better of which I Garglore'd).

Overall, an OK game that I don't mind playing, especially with the family, but wouldn't recommend for a group of adults that regularly play games with more heft.

RATING: 6
The thing that kills this game is the iconography of each board. Its too much to absorb when you first play. and its just kind of, ok, Ill default to the easiest spot. There isnt really an advantage to the hard spots on the board since someone can scare all your people away in one turn..all the people you spend multiple turns trying to get in place. Man, i really want to love this game Im just not seeing it yet.

RATING: 4
Light and harmless game of cute aliens trying to escape a planet that is about to explode.  It comes with ten "lift off points", each with a different cost and operation method, and only four are used per game. This should give it some replayability, but a few of them are boring or even stupid (one requires one alien of each player to launch). The main problem, however, is that the gameplay is too simple and straightforward, requiring very little thought. On your turn, you basically make two movements with your aliens and play cards to pay for climbing onto the launch platforms. There are some cards with special actions to spice things up, but this really increases luck of the draw, because each action card that you draw is one fewer resource card. The game may work with children, but it has nothing to engage adults and is too long for a filler.

This is probably a solid family game, but with two adult players it was a bit too light and sort of played itself. I'd play it again if someone wanted to, but feel no need to own it.

Easy to learn and play game. The art is funny and it scales well for all player counts. The game is so funny that you don't even care when someone plays an event card that sends all your aliens back to the core. Better than Survive IMHO, mainly because the theme is so well represented. Excellent replayability with 10 different lift off points.

Lift Off! is a great gateway family game which is absolutely gorgeous (quality and artwork) and just feels nice to play through.  It's a little mean-ish as players can really mess over their opponents, but it's all in good fun.  I like that players don't have a lot to think about on their turn and so there's not a large amount of downtime between turns, even in higher player count games.  It also has some great variants, particularly the one which has players cooperate to get everyone off the planet before it explodes.  Good game with some amazing artwork.

RATING: 5.5
This as a heavy family game, and it does have a cutthroat mode that "gamers" will enjoy.  The game is essentially a race to get your aliens off the planet in normal mode and it almost encourages cooperation.  But in cutthroat mode, you can interfere with other aliens quite a bit to give yourself an advantage.  There are enough decisions to help mitigate your luck of the draw from the deck of cards.
It's a more involved than your typical family board game, but light when compared to Euro games. 
The art is attractive and catches a lot of people's interest.

In Lift Off!, players have a number of pawns in the middle of the board, and are trying to get all of them off the board before the game timer expires.  The game features a modular board that provides for different methods of "escaping".  Unfortunately, though, most of these board elements just feature different flavors of random.  While the premise of the game is a little like Survive!, negotiation and player interaction have almost entirely been replaced by randomness.  You can do a little to affect other players, but for the most part everyone did their own thing. Didn't really care for this one, but at least the components and art were really cute.

Ok family game, but feels a lot like a simplified Survive: Escape from Atlantis.  Because you can't plan your turn until you see what cards you draw (you really should draw 2 at the end of your turn, not the start), there's quite a bit more downtime than Survive. And with no hidden scoring, there very little suspense.  Play Survive instead.

It is a little repetitive, and the 'Gargalore' might feel rather spiteful for what is a family game. But the movement of the moon rises it above a meh 5, and it does look nice in a silly way.

We have now played 2, 4 and 5 players.  What an absolutely fantastic game.  It is light and quick.  It is somewhat subject to the random whimsy of the draw pile, but an element of chance is good to have in family games.

The component quality is fantastic.  We are particularly happy with the thickness of the board pieces, and how well they fit together and come apart.  Terraforming doesn't need to be treated with extreme care!

We put numbered sticky dots on the back of the lift off sections, and popped a d10 in the box.  Easy random selection of the lift off segments.  We found shuffling them a bit awkward.  :)

There aren't many choices in this game.  You draw your two cards and do what you can with the cards you get.  For about 90 percent of my turns, there was basically only one thing I could do with the cards I drew.  For the other 10 percent of my turns, there was nothing that I could do with the cards I drew.  There was never any turn where I had to decide between two equally appealing choices.  I'm not willing to play this again.

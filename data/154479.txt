RATING: 3.5
I want to like this game. It has delightful components and an excellent magnetic box. It also comes from the designer responsible for Dominion, an excellent game, and a friendly guy who is active (and helpful) on BGG.

A variety of "adventures" modify the rules for very different experiences which should give the game plenty of replay value.

However, on two out of three plays so far we have become "locked" into a round that was very difficult to end. This is completely at odds with its appearance as a nice, light filler game.

We're going to throw in a few house rules to see if the game can be fixed (see below).

I will not keep the rating this low if on further plays our experience improves.

Update: Boosting this from a 5 to a 6 1/2. 

Keeping the hell away from "adventure" mode appears to have fixed this game for us. We play it houserules in cruise mode. Basically: the winner of any round draws three tiles and puts one of the rules into play. They keep a tile before them face down to track score and put the remaining tile to the bottom of the stack. Additionally, when a person would put a fifth or sixth tile into play, they may optionally discard one of the old rules. Lastly, no more than six rules are ever allowed in play. A player placing a down a seventh adventure tile always discards an old rule.

I've managed to play a few games of this where it doesn't lock up and become unbearable, but at the end of the day the potential for that to happen is still there. Regardless, we enjoy this as a light filler. I feel it works best as a 3 or 4 player game. It gets slow if you have more than that.

Another edit: it's still very easy for this to get locked and create a frustrating experience. I can't recommend it. If we play it, we keep the number of additional tiles locked at 3 or 4.

To be honest it's probably my favorite Donald Vaccharino game to date. (I know Dominion is important and influential, but I just like a few of the games it inspired more.) The card art is great, and for a relatively simple card game I enjoy how the Adventure Tiles add in the varying game play (but also serve a dual function as map pieces you collect to form an 'x' and win). Simple but good.

After two hands, we quietly put this back in the box.

Basically a mash up of Uno and Flux. I really enjoy playing this with my kids. I would give it a higher score, but it has a tendency for rounds to get a little long for the same reason as this happens in Uno. I do really like the rules that are added to the game as you go. I'm not a fan of Flux, but I like how it's done in this Pina Pirata.

It's like UNO and Fluxx mixed together. It's easy to understand and teach, but takes too long for what it is with higher numbers of players. I've played with 3 and with 6 and 3 players was a much more enjoyable experience.

RATING: 3
Uno meets Fluxx. Blech. 

In fact, the game combines the worst qualities about each game: the arbitrary, totally luck-driven card mechanics of Uno with the interminable length and chaos of Fluxx. After playing for a half hour, we were only 1/4 of the way through the whole game. We ended it early, after only three hands, whereupon I offered to give the game away, that moment, to anyone present who wanted it. Nobody took me up on the offer. 

Donald X. should be embarrassed that his name is attached to this stinker.

RATING: 6
Fun enough game with cute artwork, but the game overstayed it's welcome when playing to 4 map pieces. We played 3 player - next time will play to only 2 or 3 map pieces. The stacking rules keep things interesting, but can bog the game down a bit at times. Again, this can be remedied by limiting the rule tiles in play. We played with the recommended rule of a 6 tile limit. 
My kids were losing focus by the 4th round or so which likely influenced my opinion (for the worse) in our first game. Will see if there is improvement on future plays. Initial rating:  6

First play-through was bad.  But I quite enjoyed the second time through.  It's a great trick taking game, where you're trying to be the first to rid your hand of all cards.  The twist to this game it at the end of each round a new rule is added to the game that may require you to match a certain animal or draw several cards...etc.

Its really good fun and by the last round we have quite the crowd wanting to play.
Each turn you play a card that features one or two animals that must match the previously played card, or draw an extra card or cards. What makes the game particularly interesting is that after each round the winner (person to play all their cards) pick one of two map tiles to put into play as a piece of the map and the other tile into play as a new rule. New rules can be quite simple such as making all of a card type wild or can make opponents draw more cards when certain conditions are met. Each round a new rule is added until somebody reaches the required 4 pieces of treasure map at which point they are declared the winner.

I really like the animal pirate artworks and this is good fun, the only downside is the cards are not a sleeveable size.

Rating as a kid's game. Not worth it for adults only. Too long with too many players, so it's best to play to 3 pieces with 4 or more...even if that doesn't give you a nicely completed X.

Great quick family game. Played it 4 times in a row after opening the box. Plays great with 2, 3 and 4. It's a bit strategic with 2. With 3 or 4 is a bit chaotic but very fun. For me it's no good with 5 or 6 players but even then it plays quickly. The artwork is amazing but sometimes it's difficult to differentiate the different animals (walrus and rabbit, monkey and penguin) - not so big of a deal if you play it up to 4. Plays in less than 30 minutes. My 9-year old sister loved it, my parents enjoyed it a lot. Just be sure to repeat each round every single one of the special conditions/rules that are in the play. Takes little space and can be taken anywhere. Really fun. Great game.

RATING: 9.5
Crazy Eights (or Uno) with a twist. Several twists, actually! The game comes with 40 "Adventure" tiles with rules on them. You start with 2 such rules and then add another each hand.

Piña Pirata is ultra-light, and with perhaps the exception of a few initial plays after getting the game, its probably not going to be the game you choose when sitting down with a bunch of your gamer friends. But! There are two situations in which you may be very happy to have a copy of Piña Pirata on hand.

First, you want to play a game with some of your family or non-gamer friends. Most players who enjoy Uno (ugh) will also enjoy Piña Pirata, and Piña Pirata is WAY more interesting and fun than Uno.

Second, you need to kill some time while you wait, but you don't know exactly how much time you have to kill. Example: you're hosting a game night and your gamer friends are filtering in slowly over the course of an hour and you don't want to get down to a heavy game until everyone arrives. You can start playing Piña Pirata, and guests that arrive can jump in between hands. Once everybody's there, you can finish that hand or not, as you feel. Likewise you can play it in a restaurant while waiting for your food. It's the truest "filler" game I've found.

If you find yourself in either of these situations with any regularity, I recommend you give Piña Pirata a shot!

Rating is for cruise mode. Adventure mode is a drag. I think this game is at its best when you play it while waiting for pizza or something similar where you have relatively little time to play and might want to end the game abruptly. It's UNO-like timekiller really. But superior one. A very good timekiller. The art is weird mix of boring white background and detailed pirate animals, it looks quite messy and it's hard to tell the animals apart at first.

2-Player Comment:
*Works fine with two, some special powers can be meaningless (change turn order etc.), but it's still my preferred count. I doubt I'd play with more than 3. Having to wait for your turn in a game like this can be very boring!

I really expected this to be a better version of Uno. Well, it is and it isn't. I like the randomized rules that can come into play, but I really found myself longing for more special cards, such as the draw 2 and reversal cards in Uno. Unless rules come into play that state that certain cards fill these roles, every card in the deck is like an ordinary number card. I wasn't expecting much, but still came away feeling disappointed.

Would rather play Tem-Purr-A.

A light card game, where you're trying to get rid of your cards while using the extra rules (adventures) to your advantage. It's interesting to find the dominant combo of the round, according to the adventures that are in play. On the flipside, VERY long with more than 4 players; play another game.

Be careful for your first game. If you draw 2 adventure cards that both will slow down the game, change one of them or even both. The round will cost you too much time if you have 5 or 6 players. After adding more and more adventure cards in your game, people will start to find the interesting design of this game. A good party game.

A light filler game that has a simple base game that is similar to a double suited Crazy eights w/o the wild 8.  However, the interesting part of the game are the various game rules that are added during the rounds of play. Adapting to these rules can really get wacky and fun and there is some tactics and light strategy that can play as you try to figure out a synergy with these rules.   A solid Donald X filler game that might work better with 3 than 2 but are both enjoyable and can be difficult to keep track of.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I think it's ok as a 3-4-player game as a light filler to pass time. 2-player game is just a dull experience where both players may end up drawing cards since you don't have the right symbols. 

You should mainly take rules that make the game go faster. Having couple "be mean to other players"-rules is fine but having too many will bog down the game. There is some room for clever card play and others will hit you if you are close to winning It is fun to see how the different combinations of rules will work together. Max. 6 rules is a good rule to have.

I'm ranking it this high because of how well received it is by a variety of people, specifically those who are not traditionally gamers. A great family game. Basically it's UNO except it has this really interesting mechanic where each round the winner chooses a tile which adds a rule to the rest of the game. The additional rules can completely change the game and makes things a bit frantic as everyone tries to keep track of them. A simple game made more enjoyable with a simple addition.

The game says 7+ but I think it should say 7-12 because the game is not enjoyable by anyone older than 12. The game is just too simple. Its just playing a card or drawing a card.

RATING: 3
If you want to have a different version of [gameid=2223] to satisfy your sense of gamer elitism, here it is.  The mechanics are highly derivative of that classic family card game and its public-domain sibling, Crazy Eights.  From your hand of cards, match the symbol that was last played.  If you can't, draw a card.  The one addition from the rules is that a few rules will come out during the game which will change the rules just a little.

The problem?  Those rules don't add any decisions of significant weight.  You get more rules, but decisions are no different from Uno.  Maintain the best hand-flexibility you can, so that you can play on as many cards as possible, and hope that the endgame plays out so that you can lay your last card.

I'm no fan of Donald X. Vaccharino, but this game is easily his worst.

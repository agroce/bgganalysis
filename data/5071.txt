I aim for the 4-box and the disc doesn't even come close. See here my frustration. And then the space for your hand is limited and sometimes you hit the bar and that's hurting.

Great for any age, children can compete fairly against an adult (there's as much luck as there is skill especially in 'teams'). Several boards can make for a good fund-raising night for the school, Scouts, Church etc.

I must have played well over 100 games of this over the years and still it challenges me. One of the great social games out there.
Shame its a little noisy......
Own three boards and they all play differently.

I played this all the time as a child; I'd love to get a board someday!

RATING: 6
A fun dexterity game, but it seems like a ton of skill is required to truly get the pieces in the end on purpose.    Our game became a mostly-random "throw stuff down the other end and hope for the best" sort of affair.   I wonder if it's even possible to be accurate at that distance.

RATING: 8
It is multiplayer solitaire, but so is bowling and golf. It is a lot fun at our parties. We have a pool table, and other large games in our game room and yet people still congregate around this one when we host any sort of gathering.

RATING: 8.5
Light coloured board.  Older than I am.  Pucks are getting to be in rough shape.  Slides really well.  Wear at throwing end from pucks rubbing.

RATING: 8.5
Second Board given by my parents.  This one is dark wood with a section for the pucks to be stored.  Doesn't slide as nicely as the older light coloured board.

Simple manual dexterity game, suited to casual family/party game settings. I remember intense tournaments of this as a kid with the next door neighbours. Parents still have the set we used to play. Eva really enjoyed it. Would get a set for home but it is quite bulky to store.

See my rview for more details: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/422939. As the title suggests, as far as dexterity games go, it is not as good as Crokinole.

Typical Dutch game of sliding wooden discs through gates; actually it is a solitary game, but played as a competition with others; we often played this game at Christmas with "the whole family"; I can remember great discussions about whether the discs had passed the gates or not.

Excellent dexterity game. Some will even call it a sport (like darts etc) and are very serious about their game.

I (actually my children [3.5 and 5 yo]) own a colourful children-sized version and a few 'Super Sjoeler' discs (branded discs, handed out by a supermarket chain).

Classic dexterity game from The Netherlands.  Doesn't have interaction like Crokinole, but still fun in the right context.

Goodness knows where my parents got this from, but we played it a lot as kids. We spent ages debating the pros and cons of careful accuracy versus getting into a pacier rhythm.

I was still playing it in adulthood, but its lack of portability meant that it eventually got replaced in my gaming life by [thing=12171]Pucket[/thing], which is quicker, more frantic and more portable.

Played it with my parents and daughter yesterday. The sjoelbak is made by my grandfather and so are the sjoelstenen. I love that! My daughter was hiding under the table when my father sjoelde and was laughing all the time, because the sjoelstenen were flying around (he throws real hard)she picked them up from the flour and gave them back so he could throw the same sjoelsteen again, pretty good strategy, he won :)It was hard to get more than hundred points. At the start of you're turn you have throw gentle and aim very well, after a while there are a lot of stones and you have to throw hard and still aim. We had so much fun!!! We must play this more often!

If it enjoyed the fame of Crokinole, Sjoelen would also rank in the BGG top 100. If you're into wood-working I recommend building your own sjoelbak - see my review for more info.

Used to play this a lot when I was a kid. Like it because you need practice. Now we only have the small version with less stones and a LOT more friction. Not very playable. The 'real' one would get a 7!

However it is at my mothers place as so many of the games when i was a kid.
Only this one I checked as own. Because it was a fun game to play for everyone involved.
those were the days :)
I remember playing a variant in which you only got thirty seconds to get rid of your discs :)

Sjoelen appears to be 'hot' among youths in Holland these days (2007), so the 'dusty' image is gone, for now... The kids are reportedly even having their own custom coloured "sjoelstenen" (sjoel-stones). Anyway, nice skill game.

2 / 5 - Fair.

Really couldn't get excited about this game - there seems to be nothing to it but sliding discs at very small targets. No strategy, no theme, no player interaction, nothing else but ... sliding ... discs. Of course, it doesn't help that I'm completely crap at it :)

I guess this is in the top 3 for "largest board games". Always have to have a go when I (rarely) come across one of these. It's a great dexterity game, and I'm sure I'm gonna buy one someday.

UPDATE: got a Homas board as a present!

RATING: 6.5
A Dutch version of Shuffleboard, with four gates - scoring 2-3-4-1 - through which you must aim your many large pucks. Scoring doubles for sets of 4, so getting an even spread is important. It is effectively a solo dexterity game, where you try to beat your best/others' scores and is currently making regular appearances to our game group, giving a pleasing clack-clack background noise when people are transitioning between games.

Maybe it's not as much fun as I remember (my sjoelbak days were in the 80s when I was a little boy, after all).

Gamefish board - Maple deck w/ black walnut trim.

A nice game to leave set up and just have fun playing.  Easy to play while waiting for others and inviting for kids and adults alike.  A bit like Pitchcar in that pucks have to be moved, but plays a lot faster then Pitchcar with (for me) a lot of the same joy.  There is a nice billiards aspect to bouncing the pucks.  Getting bonus points for complete sets (a puck in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 spot is worth 20, not 10) adds to the scoring challenge as one doesn't just shot the pucks down the track hoping to score something.)

Handmade by my dad. The scoring bonus for having an equal number of stones in each creates nice tension.

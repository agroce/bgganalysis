A good idea but a horrible horrible game.

2016-03-31
I love the idea of a collectible hex game. However, the hexes are so full of minuscule detail essential for the game play that it soon becomes a really energy consuming excercise to keep track of everything that is going on. Moreover, the biggest complaint I have about the game is that the starter seems to have an advantage. If you just rush it, the opponent basically will always be one step behind. You take turns to lose 1 life until player 2 loses, unless something extraordinary happens.

Interesting mechanics, and nice artwork.  Plus a pretty good game, although it needs to be tweaked slightly so that the first player doesn't start off with a winning advantage.  Fantasy Flight is probably going to reprint the rares, but this game doesn't hit the table often enough for me to keep it.  Pity, because it is a good game.

RATING: 2.5
I'm sorry, but this does not deserve the praise it has received.  The game bogs down in tiny minute details. I count upward of nine separate attributes on the tiles that you must take into account. Once you have done that, then you can read the paragraph of cheese. If you want a collectible CCG with board game positioning, stick with Doomtown/Deadlands. If for some reason you need a hexagonal positional system, stick with Hive. Stay away from this stinker!

OK, but fataly wounded in its initial release by collectibility (and bad collation, to boot). Too many factions makes it difficult to build anything coherent. It also leaves the game succeptible to super"cards" that have counter-strategies, just not ones that happen to be in your collection. Even so, I'd like to give it another try, especially with the unrestricted options of the Maelstrom release. But: so many games, so little time.

RATING: 10
04/23/13 - my collection is essentially complete. There are a few tiles I wouldn't mind having additional copies of, but basically I've got it all. Now I just need to find willing opponents until my son is old enough to enjoy this!

04.04.11 - updating my rating to 10!

...

One of those really infinitely-customizable, non-standard fantasy games.  Sort of like Blue Moon in this regard, though I like the positional aspect of Vortex play.  Like others, I do wish they had marketed this as an expandable game where you knew what you were buying (like maybe a starter and 2 or 3 pre-defined boosters per faction).

The more I play this, the more I respect the design.  The positional play and lack of random elements in combat gives it a unique spacial strategy flavor that's lacking in similar games.  The abilities of the tiles seem fairly balanced to their costs (Draconoid Battlelord being a notable exception - it's undercosted, in my opinion).  Having 8 factions to pit against each other is fantastic - that's 56 individual matchups right there if you don't care about playing good vs. good or evil vs. evil.

RATING: 6
I'm coming at this game from a perspective of someone who never got more than very casually involved with CCGs. I've only played the packaged Maelstrom Vortex game, so I know there are aspects that are missing...or at least more fully developed with the addition of some rare flats. I abhor that selling model (where you don't know what cards/tiles/flats you're actually purchasing and some are made artificially scarce (more expensive), so I don't see myself ever buying the expansion pack that is now available.

My experience with the game was that I enjoy the spatial nature, but I felt like I want MORE. There isn't enough diversity in the cards...or the ones that are in the decks seem a little bland somehow. 

I was suprised at how much this game reminded me of Blue Moon, but that may just be my sparse CCG background showing. 

The art/components are fine. It seems like there are flats in the box that you can't really use effectively as is...that you need MORE of them or additional flats in order to really make them work.

That said, each of the 4 main races is quite unique and have interesting things to do. I feel like a lot more strategy opens up when you are familiar enough with the deck to know what's remaining in your hand (and possibly in your opponent's) but I haven't played it nearly that many times. 

I like the pace and the length of the game. I look forward to trying this one some more. Probably my favorite thing is that you draft your starting hand, randomly assign a start player who then randomly discards one of their starting hand and replaces it. So you have some risk/reward thing for putting strong tiles in the opening hand. Nice little tension there right off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Something of a provisional rating here...the game has a really compelling feel thanks to the movement and placement rules, is well-designed and has some pretty cool mechanics but it does seem like something is missing without events and artifacts that apparently are forthcoming in an expansion.  Without more powerful tiles, it seems like most fights end up in mutual destruction but careful planning can fix that problem.  If the "rares" turn out to provide a little more variety and shake things up a bit, this could peak at an 8.  Complaints aside, this is a heck of a bargain!

I was rather underwhelmed, especially after all the high praise Vortex has received.  The game feels static and restricted in terms of strategic variability and options.  Haven't tried to build custom decks yet - maybe my rating will improve after that.  But for now, I'm disappointed.  And the game is not helped by the micro-sized text on the tiles - it feels like work to try reading everything during the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My current rating is for the Vortex collectible tile game and NOT the Maelstrom boxed set.  The reason is that the boxed set comes with 1 starter deck each for 4 of the 8 factions and basically for the factions that don't have starter deck tiles included there's not enough tiles to use them in their own single deck.  The factions with less tiles could be added to the starter deck factions for a dual-faction deck but consistency would be reduced and games would be worse than when using single factions.   Even using the factions that have enough tiles to make a deck will eventually become dull because there's just not enough variety of tiles and there are some tiles that you would want more 1 copy of.  So if you're going to collect a fair number of tiles (through Vortex boosters/starters or multiple Maelstrom boxed sets), I think there is a decent game with CCG-like gameplay combined with positioning of your hex tiles being important like in Hive or Neuroshima Hex.  Otherwise, I would probably wouldn't bother.

RATING: 7
Played once. The back of the box is a little misleading; this does not include everything found in all four Vortex starter packs; it does not include the flats of rare tiles you'd get if you bought them. Still, a great value for the money, the best way to purchase Vortex, and the game is good. I think the tile mix for the 4 non-starter factions is a little weak, but that can be addressed by purchasing a second Maelstrom set or some boosters (which would give you some rares). Not necessary, though, so don't be turned off if you're not into collectability.  The game has chess-like qualities.

A great predescesor to Summoner Wars that requires a lot of playing in order to know the possibilities of all the tiles by heart. Only then you can play it right.

It gives a lot of tactical and even some strategical opportunities and A LOT of replayability - the sheer number of races and tiles is just amazing.

Not my cup of tea but I appreciate the idea and its execution. A very solid tactical game.

RATING: 7
Very good strategy/tilelaying-title. Combines lots of different elements really well and offers a good variety of factions. One of them seems to be bit useless with only single pack of Maelstrom, but otherwise the box includes enough to create some different decks and experience a good, strategic two-player game with a low price. Blue Moon and Mystick are better semi-CCGs though.

Didn't really thrill me.  It's mostly non-random, but it just didn't seem balanced after two games.  The first player seems to be at an advantage, and the second player has seemingly few options for their first couple plays, as doing the wrong thing in the first few turns spells near-immediate death.  The units seem weak and uninteresting for the most part, but there's at least variety.  It does have nice art and some interesting features, and the start of the game is nonrandom.  Maybe it would be more fun if I read up on strategy tips before trying it again.

A shame, since I liked the idea and was very interested in this one. It just felt very dry and uninspiring.

Rating based on a few 2-player basic games. More comments after more plays. Update: This becomes a much better game with 4 players, especially in team play -> rating +1. Three player variant is broken unless "fair play" rule is adopted - If first and second player decide to advance towards last player, there's nothing (save dumb luck with drawn tiles) the last player can do but to burn away. "Fair play" rule states everyone must be allowed to have 3 spaces next to vortex before mayhem begins.

RATING: 5
The rating's partially hopeful, that it might improve some (or maybe more) if I find some expansion tiles. Out of the box the factions seem a bit rock-paper-scissors, e.g. it's too easy to beat A with B, B with C etc., which probably makes the 2 vs. 2 team game the best way to play. I found some extra tiles, let's see if they bring it alive.

UPDATE: Not going for the collecting bit again (or hunting down a dead series). It might improve with the event tiles, but there are a lot better 2-player non-wargames to go for.

Played once.  Not bad.  I like the spacial aspect and find that the game is primarily a game of positional advantages.  The minions in this set are very weak and most combats result in both the attacker and defender being killed.

A classic that I know will be played for many years to come. A brilliant game which surpasses Invasion (or any other card game for that matter) by far, and I can't imagine it giving up the throne to any other game in its category (Summoner Wars seems to be some kind of joke compared to Vortex / Maelstrom). Although it is a tile game rather than a card game, yet it still fits into the CCG/LCG format in most aspects (multiple factions, minions battle one another, different keywords and abilities, production, etc.). Gameplay is incredibly tense and just one small mistake can cost you everything - you really have to keep your guard up at all times! And, although the factions (a total of 8) might seem a little bit out of balance in the beginning, then after a few years of playing this game I have come to realize that each and every of them has the potential to brutally wipe out the opposition - you just need to understand how to maximize its strengths and minimize its weaknesses. The only problem I can see with this game is that in order to REALLY explore its potential you need at least one core set (the "Maelstrom" starter) and a few expansions (the core set itself doesn't even begin to scratch the surface). At present, I own three core sets and a large amount of expansions (random boosters, in fact) and I would STILL buy one more core set if I only had the chance. And this is, unfortunately, the root of the problem - Vortex / Maelstrom has been out of print for a long time and I don't expect it to be re-released any time soon. Oh well, I'm still happy to own the nice collection that I have managed to hoard over the years. In brief, this game is a definite 10 - one of the toughest brain-burners of all time, yet delivering insanely enjoyable gamplay. A genuine CLASSIC!

Who would have thought?  A Hive-derived tile-laying CCG that is one of the more innovative games I have played in the last few weeks. Only one play in which to tell, but there's a lot going on here, and a lot to think about.  The fact that you have to move units first is crucial, and you can easily hurt yourself by not planning correctly.  I really like the fact that building and unit casualties turn into energy tiles when killed, and that energy can be sucked up by either side.  Lastly the fight to have most tiles nearest the Vortex is a great twist, and leads to some vicious gameplay.Rating likely to go up as I play more.  Now, who's the designer?

This is a great game.  The spatial aspect is interesting in itself as it permits locking and blocking moves, but it also facilitates several separate economies.  The game has a mana economy, it has an economy of essence, an economy of tiles in hand, and it has an economy of tempo.  All of the economies are interconnected at punitive exchange rates: for instance 2 essence equals one more action, or two actions buy you one more essence. Every decision then involves trade-offs between these economies.  The decks are small so there are not surprises around every corner like in some CCGs.  The different decks really feel and play differently.  To me this is Neuroshima Hex, done rather better.... After a few more years the rating has risen. There is not the killer combo effect of a CCG like Magic, much more depends on the play which presents interesting choices on many turns.

It's a pity that the collectible "Vortex" game didn't do better commercially. It is really a stroke of genius from the early days of Fantasy Flight Games.

Great game. Effectively combines strategic functions of a CCG while optimizing strategic positioning and movement. Excellent artwork and getting all the commons & uncommons in one boxed set is awesome.

It's a very interesting concept.  Much more strategic than Magic the Gathering is, to which it is often compared.  Plus tiles are cool. This is also relatively very inexpensive.  I have played with my wife, she enjoyed it more than she thought she would.  Much more dependent on choices made than tiles drawn.  Replayability = extremely high due to number of tiles included ~150.  Plus I bought 3 expansion boosters, another 135 tiles. Rarely gets played these days.  I don't know why.

Probably shouldn't have gotten rid of this, but I wasn't getting chances to play it, and wanted someone else to have it.

Only played this a few times, but I got a good impression of it. It's easier then it first looks to lose all your mana points very quickly. However a good strategy can turn the game around just as quickly. A decent game. Comes with tons of units.

The game is not my cup of tea.

Amazing game! I think part of the reason the game is not rated higher is because you need some of the rare tiles to increase the diversity of options, which is difficult to obtain when the game is long out of print. I have been fortunate to complete my set, including all four of the elusive promo tiles.

An unusual collectible game from Fantasy Flight, now being offered in a non-collectible box set. If I had to try and pin down this game with a simple explanation, it plays sort of like Hive but with each tile having combat statistics and far more complicated special powers. It's an interesting game, but a bit too abstract for my taste.

This is a very solid game that gives you loads of stuff for a small price.  From a game stand point, its a mix of collectible card game and war game, which sounds a little odd, but is actually very enjoyable.  By adding in the expansion (for even greater variability) you have an absolutely huge game that is very enjoyable to play.

Fun collectible style board game.  Rating might go up or down based on future plays.

10 for Vortex, if you have a full enough collection.  8 for Maelstrom, since giving you all the commons and no rares is a very stupid way to republish a collectible game.

collectable hex battle game...when I first got this I was stoked, but now years later it's just an oddity really...

Maelstrom is a good start, but it needs the rare tiles of the full Vortex set to really shine as a game. As it is, the game always ends when someone runs out of tiles.

RATING: 6
An excellent attempt at a Magic-style hex game.  Innovative win mechanic, good art, great keywords, balanced play, enough stats and abilities to be engaging.

It breaks down simply because there's too much board information.  It's Magic meets chess (or Hive, more appropriately).  Maelstrom rewards analysis paralysis on virtually every turn, and that is enough to ruin the game.

The rating is for the game Vortex as a whole and not only for the Maelstrom boxed set.

I bought a VERY limited collection with which to try out this game. It's interesting, but ultimately doesn't have quite enough depth to get me to keep searching out more flats of pieces.

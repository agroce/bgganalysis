Sharp looking game with an extremely brilliant mechanic for command and control.  It's shooting more for balance and mechanics than historical outcome, so if this concerns you, be aware of it (it says as much in the designer notes).  I have plenty of Gettysburg games, so when I want a sim, I look there, but if I want a darned fun game, I go here.

First play left me a bit worried; I didn't like the game as much as Waterloo and felt that it's a bit too slow for my taste. Game has been simplified in many aspects which is good but I longed for a little bit more diverse game play.

Game probably also follows similar pattern from game to game. Union players retreats and digs in and confederation player tries to move the troops in forward as quickly as possible and win early. If confederation does not succeed in early victory then his going to bang his head against the entrenchments of the union player.

A few more plays will tell if this is the case.

Second, after Waterloo, Martin Wallace entry into wargames. Very good idea, especially command blocks and orders discs system. Historical climate without too much fiddly rules. Better than Waterloo in terms of randomness. Much more planning. Good, asymmetrical differences between both sides. Confederates are offensive side, they can outmaneuvre Union, which have problems with cohesion of its orders, but anchoring a strong defensive position on Cemetery Ridge and Round Top should force Rebs to frontal and very costly assaults.

My conclusion: it all comes down to the first day. If the CSA manages to get a foothold in the hills, they can win. If not, 2 boring days of bombarding an pointless attacks will follow, leading to an inevitable USA-victory.

That's a shame, cause the game plays pretty quick and the command-system is very interesting. I think if this system is used for a more dynamic battle a great game woud emerge.

This is system is a solid look at ACW command with very low rules overhead. My only reservation is the subject matter, which I think limits the replayability of a game at this scale. Still, it is fun and fast, and gives the players lots of agonizing choices.

RATING: 8.5
Command/order system is very good - don't let the wooden meeples fool you, this is very much a wargame. Creates a good feel for the actual battle without a vast array of rules.

One thing that is slightly disappointing is that the board/map does not provide enough room to the south for the Confederate player to try to manoeuvre to flank that end of the Union line - which I think was Longstreet's preference for Day 3 of the battle.

My only other criticism is that the rule book could be a bit 'tighter' - cav/artillery retreats need some additional wording.

RATING: 7
Players take either the Confederates or the Union and refight the three days at Gettysburg. Players take turns to either place a command block (numbered 2-5), remove a command block, or use a command block to issue orders to nearby units.  Orders are move/assault, fire artillery, entrench, rally, reinforce and so on.  Command blocks eventually fill up, and have to be removed/replaced to maintain on map tempo, and the game begins to feel very much like a management exercise, and that's no bad thing. Assault and artillery is simple stuff, a bit procedural but quickly taken on board. The game ends in several ways, either take the Round Tops during any afternoon (Rebels), take any two starred areas southeast of Gettysburg (Rebels), or survive three days (Union).  I like this game, it looks a bit odd, and even plays a bit odd, but if you can get past that, it does feel like a Gettysburg game.  The Rebs have to rush in from the north and west and gobble up as much as they can on day one, which will dictate how the next two days will pan out.  I feel that the Union is the more unforgiving side to play, and they have to be very careful in the action management.  Rules are a bit opaque in places, but nothing you can't get past.

I like it better than Waterloo -- this is a cleaner game that plays faster. I do intensely dislike the entrenchment rules and I can think of no justification why the Union controls the tempo (turn end) so precisely. Interaction of command and combat systems offer some nice tactical puzzles. Overall more clever than good and not certain I'll go back to it.

Based on one play.

I liked it as there were a lot of very tough choices. 
Requires a lot of skill in the management of the orders.

In the end it felt a little dry, but it must have been the effect of the particular battle, not the system per se. 
This is because - as the Union - I waged a purely defensive battle, with the occasional disruption tactic. 
It would have been nice if the Union had also to attack in some areas so to keep things dynamic.

I'm sure there is a very tight game down there, with very little room for mistakes... I want to play again!

RATING: 6
One play as Confederates. The command system really saves this game, which could otherwise fall a little flat. For Confederates, trying to plan logistics of the order discs to maintain momentum whilst also bringing in reinforcements from the rear is an enjoyable challenge. The main asymmetry in forces is that the Union is a little more likely to stall, and be forced to pass, managing available orders for them is most important. This is just enough difference in the sides, I get a bit overwhelmed by games where the sides function extremely differently. The slight changes in order numbers/mechanics creates the right feel without too much divergence from core rules.  Roads on the board very much dictate reasonable paths of advance, but this is okay. Damage cubes are not an elegant solution, requiring a little too much shuffling of bits about the board. Some board spaces are too small to contain all pieces during assault which is irksome. Some errors in the rulebook and aids provided, but there usually is with a war/treefrog production, par for the course.

Once the Union has been pushed back, the game turns a little dull, it becomes very much just a repeated series of assaults against an entrenched position, which isn't that fun to do.

Martin Wallace has simplified his Waterloo system for the American Civil War, but the transition isn't an entirely happy one. This is one tough battle for the Union to win. Determined Confederates can take the hills almost immediately (and they have a huge advantage if they start their forces on the Carlisle Road). If they get even a toe hold on day 1 then the Union is still in for a tough time as counter attacks are all but futile without double orders available. A shame as this is fundamentally a clever game system, but it really needed to be a generic system with varied maps like Commands and Colours.

Twin brother of "Waterloo". Nice and simple map and tons of wood inside the box.Simple but not simplistic recreation of the largest battle of the ACW. The Command Block/Order Disc system works exceptionally good.Though not a simulation the gamesytem recreates the command system and the decisionmaking of the fieldgenerals rather good imho.

Gettysburg plays much more smoothly then its predecessor Waterloo. It has less different unit types, a much simpler structure for combat, stronger focus on actual objectives and (because of the topic) more open starting positions which allow for more movement and maneuvre. It's also less punishing to attack in Gettysburg. In Waterloo an attack could easily mean that all your attacking infantry gets eliminated if your opponent managed to keep his cavalry which made the battles feel more random.  In Gettysburg the risks are much more manageable. It's a very unique and fun system.

Highly abstracted Euro-style version of the battle of Gettysburg. Limited resources force tough decisions but there are other games that do the same almost as elegantly with a little more historical detail.  I like the command system but I also liked the similar command structure of Gettysburg: Badges of Heroes.  I found the damage tracking mechanisms a little tedious -- kind of a clunky stain on an otherwise tidy game.

Really dig the system of using command blocks and order discs.  
People ought to ditch their 'chain of command' rule sets and use this Wallace system instead.
Also like the way almost every dice roll results in a hit of some sort.
I hope Wallace releases some more historical battle games using this system.

12/01/12 Played. Explanation took 90 minutes. The game took 3.5 hours (which ended 40% of the way though the possible turns). I shudder to think how long a game that went though the end of the third day would take!

My opinion improved as the game wore on. As it turned out to have a more historical flow and result than I'd feared from hearing the rules and initially seeing the board & pieces. I got over the silly looking troops (cavalry are a guy kneeling?). The orders blocks and action disk mechanism is actually pretty neat. I did think the artillery long range fire range rules were absolutely insane. Guns on a hill could hits target up to four areas away. That might be 5 miles distant. Ridiculous!!! The entrenchment marker rules are wacky as they can cause more harm (allows one to be flanked) than protection if they aren't completed. Plus I thought the concept of them at this large scale was dumb anyway. I thought the total absence of any Confederate cavalry was an oversight. True most of it was off with Stuart gallivanting around who knows where, but some units did take part in the battle. And don't be looking for any command and control rules, as generals were absent. The concept of using cubes to represent damage is good in theory. But in practice it was quite cumbersome. As some areas barely had room for four enemy and four friendly units (the max possible) plus their damage cubes (and entrenchment markers). The very epitome of "fiddly". So this was an Englishman's version of America history. And much like in Wallace's Way Out West, where he has a town called San AntoniA. Here he had CemetAry Hill. Neither are in England, so why bother to spell them correctly!  It was interesting to try. But its pretty complex for what most people would think of as mostly a Euro game at first glance.

RATING: 7.5
An ingenious design -- my rating would be higher if I thought I would play this more.  Wallace has done an excellent job combining fog of war, commander influence and a timing mechanism which creates a sort of ebb and flow with his order block mechanism.  The map is challenging and it's certainly a slog for the Confederate army to make it over over the hills to capture Union territory.  Artillery is important but once it's used it creates a smoke cloud which in turn allows the Union army to target it.  One needs to be patient and wait for the right time to attack and know when to retreat because it's a careful balance between the two sides which should usually result in some memorable fights.

RATING: 7
This is the sister game to 'Waterloo' and as such has many similarities. The pieces are wooden 'silouettes' representing infantry, artillery and (a few) cavalry units. Some people deeply objected to these in Waterloo, but for me they are quite acceptable. The game involves playing the 8 command blocks (numbered 2 to 5) in areas which then allow you to play orders up to the command limit. Gettysburg is as much about how you use your commands and limited orders as it is about military tactics. Because there are fewer unit types than waterloo there are less interactions and therefore the game is much simpler. Another solid wargame from MW.

RATING: 7.8
I love Wallace, and this game does not disappoint. The wound cubes are a bit odd, and the battery fire just feels off.  As the Union player, I had great difficulty reinforcing the fish-hook, and if the confederate player makes any gains you are sunk. I could play this tomorrow, though.  Great stuff, if a bit wonky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This clever design is fun and interesting and creates a nice tempo with periods of intense activity intersperced with lulls in the fighting as each side tries to regroup and manouver.  For the Confederates to win, they need to aggressively move into the Union lines before they have a chance to entrench.

An enjoyable, but quite complex take on the Gettysburg battle from M. Wallace. Abstract and chess-like with maneuvering and positioning playing a critical role. Really enjoyed the strategic decisions found within, and the level of complexity, mostly concerning dice modifiers, was right at my comfort level.

Two of the game mechanisms I found a bit clunky: placing entrenchment and retreat procedures. Both work fine, but proved to be quite a hurdle when understanding how they are applied in particular situations. Some might be bothered by the certain aspects of historical accuracy that are thrown out the window, but I appreciate the playability M. Wallace was aiming for.

Would love to see this battle system used with different scenarios, as I find the command block system highly intriguing. Tentative rating of a 7.5, time will tell if this rating goes up or down.

So far only run through a the first day a couple times solo. I am a sucker for Wallace, wooden bits, and Gettysburg, so this was a no-brainer. Quite similar to Yankees & Rebels; the latter has a more detail on the regiments, plays slightly quicker, and I think is a bit more wargamey than this (which is inevitably tainted with Euroisms); but this has wooden soldiers! Need to play this against a human some day - soon I hope. 

Edit: Eventually managed two games against Mrs S (who unfortunately refuses to play again). I like it. The first game naturally fell into historical lines, so for the second as the South I tried all kinds of gamey unhistorical moves, and won at end of first day, I think. May be most interesting for South, and for players (myself included) who enjoy a good few hours of a game that brings to mind the historical situation, without getting bogged down in detail. Would be interesting if somebody workedout some maps and house rules for other conflicts, using the same lovely wooden pieces.

As a so-so Wallace fan I was a bit hesitant at first to get Gettysburg.  However, it's turned out to be an absolutely excellent game -- albeit a bit of a non-starter as a history simulation.

The components are nice and the rulebook merely ok.  The PAC is useful.  The gameplay itself is a gripping and tightly designed package.  Chess-like but waaay more fun.

This game is a very fun command puzzle. Management of command blocks and order discs are crucial to winning. 

Lots of fun. Would love to play it more, but it takes up so much time (we spread it out over 3-4 days).

A little tough getting the mechanics but it's kind of diferent with one side (South) playing offense, the other (North) defense.

Another worthy addition to the Treefrog line and good use of the system and mechanics introduced in Waterloo.  The Era of battle is the same and allow for the same treatment of combat mechanics as Waterloo.  Make no mistake, this is a wargame and not a Euro by any means.

Simple, but it gives a lot of fun. If the Confederates did not win untill the middle game time, they are doomed to failure. Dices controls this game, but still you have to plan wisely if you want to win.

RATING: 7
Probably not the best simulation, but still pretty interesting.  Being a Martin Wallace game, it has several mechanics that are not very traditional for wargames like its command and order system.

Un juego introductorio para los que quieren aprender a manejarse en este tipo de juegos bélicos. Se vuelve muy pequeño si lo ponemos al lado de The Guns of Gettysburg, pero ambos tienen su momento adecuado y su público.

RATING: 9
Third title in the FAB series, Golan ’73’s rules and a design are finely honed. Questions always found their answers in the well-written manuals. The game itself, offers a knife-edged competition geared head-head set in western Syria 1973. Yet, while focusing on hidden units via blocks, it works equally well solo. Action is historical, abstraction plausible, aesthetics superb; decision-making constant. Watch out for a few minor setup erratum. And keep an eye on those rules as you play. It’s easy to overlook some special benefits and penalties the first couple of times around! FAB Golan is a great operational wargame for the Mideast and armor enthusiast: an easy segue into the Fast Action Battles series too.

Great game...suits FAB well. Can easily come down to a nail-biting finish as the Israelis power forward to regain VP areas and take out Syrian units.

Another great entry in the FAB series! So far I am liking this one even more than its FAB predecessors, and its shorter playtime means this will probably end up on the table more often.

Couple plays of this now, definitely enjoyed - I think this has promise. A little concerned about balance though, the Israelis seem really strong. It'll require pretty precise play to get the initial offensive on enough of a roll t get the VPs you need and consolidate them before the Israeli counterattack hammers you. If a balance issue does exist, I'd suggest giving the Syrian's some extra asset draws.

I'll have to play a few rounds more to make my mind completely up. But so far this is the usual strong offering of the FAB-System. A tense back and forth with the balance maybe shifted a little bit in the Israeli direction.

After one play as the IDF I have mostly positive feelings about it. A pleasant surprise given some concerns I had about being able to make this bit of history interesting as a game. But, it turns out the geography is more interesting than I would have thought, the special assets are a nice touch (if a bit fiddly), and the game-specific rules all felt appropriate.

That said, the Syrians will definitely have the greater burden, and some poor die rolling in the initial turns can potentially unhinge the game for them in the long run. In most games, though, I think you'll see the IDF holding on for dear life.

Definitely better than FAB: Sicily, and maybe even in the same league as FAB: The Bulge. Thumbs up.

4 face to face games played so far, great fun and good feeling. 
Still very hard to win for the Syrian, arab sudden victory seems unreachable.

The situation is similar to the FAB:Bulge game, except the battlefield feels more compact.  Unlike the Germans in the Ardennes, the Syrians have real potential to breakout in more than one sector. Behind the AT ditch the ground is generally open until the forces get funneled by terrain into choke points.  

The game is fun, the pressure is put onto the Syrians to get those VP spots away from the Israeli's as fast as they can.  This takes some bold moves while husbanding steps on the large combat units.   The Israeli player should be scrambling to manage crises in the line and be encourage by any step loss it can inflict early.   If they survive that, they'll get their turn to return the attack.

There are a lot of rules.  The system must get some experience to play well since there is so much to consider.

On GMT's complexity scale, it's rated 4/9, while Combat Commader is rate 5/9.  To me the FAB series is more complex.   If I was to rate it on GMT's scale I'd make it 6/9.  perhaps it's rated 4 so not to discourage sales?

Early impressions are another great entry in the series.  A smaller size entry too, which is not a bad thing.  As usual don't be worried by a long first turn, turns will become much shorter after the initial all fronts offensive.  Designer in this entry also responded to my beef with the system (especially Sicily) which is endless cannon fodder battle assets.  Limited battle assets here and they all make sense.

Game does a decent job with more modern warfare, makes me think it'd be a good system for post-WWII.  Handles this with many more mechanized category units and a play/counterplay air war with SAMs and air support assets.  Decision to represent Israeli units as the same size as Syrian units double their size is a bit gamey but I think that ultimately it works.

Two issues to be aware of---some minor setup errata which is easily correctable and almost none of it requires you to mark up the map or key components.  The other is the wadis.  I find them relatively hard to see on the map, so be very aware of where they are, they can be very consequential in slowing the offensive/counteroffensive.

Love this system.  Bring on more and a VASSAL module.

I recently purchased this title because I didn't have many modern warfare block games. I am really happy with the game components and the rule are not too difficult. I like this system and believe this would be an excellent addition to most wargamers collections

I just got it today  and it looks great. I just had FAB the Bulge before which my wife didn't like unfortunatly (she's my main playing partner). What an upgrade in this one (but I never saw Sicily). Player aids and rules are full colors. The map is very beautiful and seems very easy to read. I just regret that there are not 2 player aids with combat results, die roll modificators, etc. Annoying but it's not the only game like this, unfortunatly. Excepted that point, it looks really great and I hope to play it soon.
Edit: I just played it as a solitaire and it was really fun. Great system.

After 3 plays the Syrians have managed to get to 1VP in 1 game before being crushed by the Israelis with a sudden-death victory on turn 4 or 5 in all the games. Game seems very fragile and needs a good start by the Syrians to make it of any interest to play. So, if your Syrians don't get better than average luck in the first turn if the important road areas stop and reset. A second disappointing FAB game.

I am very disapointed. If Israel is played with no big mistakes than the winer is Syria if syrian player have good dice rolls or winner is Israel if syrian player have bad or even average rolls. Israel's rolls doesn't matter.

Well balanced, tense, and both sides get to defend and attack. I've read a lot on the Yom Kippur War and this game feels like it is recreating the situation on the Golan Heights. Tense and exciting for both players. My only criticism is reserved for the rules. I found myself page flipping a lot between the basic Series rules and the scenario specific rules, and had a hard time mastering the sequence of play. The examples of play in the Playbook are good but they refer to specific phases and did not help understand the big picture. Because this is such a procedure heavy game (where the procedures themselves can be executed quickly once you get the hang of them), I think a description of a complete turn would have been better.

Another great entry in the FAB series!  Very simple rules add a lot of historical chrome.  The assets are well designed and work appropriately, and I love the air assault and engineering/minefield/anti-tank ditch rules.  Components are also a little nicer, the counters are thicker and some have jazzier art.  Seems like a very hard game for the Syrians to win, but I will definitely have to play it more.

The people saying this is dominoes with a theme are exaggerating on both counts. Yes, the dominoes mechanic is definitely there, but that mechanic is outweighed by everything else in the game; and the theme is definitely pasted on.

But it's a good, thinky sort of game with far more interaction than it looks like it should have. Love the scoring mechanic!

Multi-player solitaire in many ways - little interaction, resulting in too much downtime. On your turn there usually is one option that is obviously best. Therefore the game plays the players instead of the other way around.

The box cover was a good promise. The game itself is a domino-based puzzle without much freedom which makes it very hard to solve. The interaction is mainly made of some "Take That" actions which kills the game for me (especially the despiteful bear).

This game in its current form is decent but feels underdeveloped. However; this can easily be fixed with an expansion addressing the games placement issues. It bugs me that it is impossible to place a tile at adjoining right angles. The promo tiles featuring one symbol increase the games enjoyment and in a sense fix, even if a little, the placement issues.

An inoffensive game of Dominoes-style tile laying with a pleasing playing rythm and a bite you don't really expect for anything Dominoes-like. The crux is that matching up identical ends nets you an extra action, and you tend to want to make these actions count, thus looking carefully at orientation and blocking options for your opponent. Also the game keeps track of two separate scores for you, and, very Knizia-like, the lowest one is the one which counts. It's not all that easy to increase both tracks simultaneously, as the scoring options for either track are located at distinctly different locations on the board. And then a well-placed bear, or a fight picked by your opponent, can prove to be a surprising nuisance.

I liked this little game more than I thought I would. It's not really a high-flyer of course, but it has been lovingly polished to a bright luster. It might make it into my collection in the future, even.

Rather simple game.  Match colors, gain points based on the numbers on the tiles, gain bonus from the color completed.  It is, however, rather difficult to get a tile to go into a cave, which grants additional points.

The scoring system is different.  You score food and health(?) points.  Your final score will be the lesser of the two.

Tile Placement
Prehistoric
Each player has a personal game board that represents the valley on which they will play tiles to determine the journey of their tribe through several prehistoric life scenes. Their aim is to gather food points on the plains and in the forests of the valley and to get shelter points for reaching caves in the mountains.

Players are leading their tribe of neanderthals out of the shelter of caves, and across the valley.  Along the way they pick up food and stop off at other caves to seek shelter.  Gloriously produced, colourful, Iello game that is very simple to pick up an play.  Essentially game play is laying down 8 suited domino tiles on a personal player board - the dominos cover up food spaces (for food points), or enter caves off the side of the playing area (for shelter points).  When you lay a tile, you trigger one or more suited actions allowing for interesting plays, such as more scoring opportunities, or messing with your opponents.

Simple game, but ultimately not that much fun.  You are very constrained by playing into your own playing area, and the ability to mess with your opponents via denying them critical tiles (drafted from a common pool), or placing bears on other player boards (to block them) easily leads to bruised feelings.  

A shame really, as it's so close to being a great game.  Jäger & Sammler for us, any time.

Great idea for a game. Having different effects on the tiles is interesting, but you often have to play the domino that fits, rather than the one you want for it's effect. Striping away many thoughtful choices and allowing the game to run you.

very investing take on the idea of domino style tiles.  I always like a tile laying game that has a bit of a spatial visualization/planning element to it.  I'm also a fan of the caveman theme in general and enjoyed that the artwork was reminiscent of Stone Age (a game I love).  Seems like there are quite a few strategies to try in this game and look forward to digging into this one.

After 1 play, I want to try it again. For some reason, I have a hard time loving any game (that I can think of) where you directly take things from other players, unless it is a direct conflict game going in. That said, it's not a huge part of the game, and I feel this game just takes one play to see how to play better next time. Part of that comes from the symbols and actions not always matching the theme particularly well, but in the end it's not complicated to learn, and I did like that it's like "gamer's dominoes" in a way.  

My fear is that it is too "thinky" to sustain the direct interfering of other players with your plans, especially if they just pick you because you happen to be sitting closest...hmmm...maybe that's a player problem, but it's also, I think, from the game looking super quick and fast on paper, but being a game where a rushed turn can really screw up the rest of your game, or at least the next couple turns. A gameplay expectation vs reality disconnect is what we have here! Still, looking forward to a second play.

Interesting use of dominos mechanics. I was hesitant to buy it, but I enjoyed it more than I expected. There are unnecessary take-that elements, and the bear that you play on an opponent's board can be really nasty, although there is some incentive to place it where it causes no harm (more points if adjacent to more tiles). Otherwise, it's a pretty good family game that may keep gamers engaged with planning and meaningful decisions every turn. The colorful artwork is very pleasant to the eye.

This game honestly feels like just a desperate clawing to make sure you get shelter tokens because food is so easy. No one felt any need to take the mamoths and get meat tokens, everyone was too desperate to try and get their shelter scores up to be able to have a chance at winning (since the lowest scoring is what goes towards victory).

If everyone at the table is aware of that the game could be okay, but if not the game I couldn't be convinced to play.

This is a fantastically clever game with nice components, a fun theme to joke around with, and solid gameplay.  It's another worthy game from Iello, but I find it to be too mean with only 2 players.  Playing with 3 or 4 players disperses out the attacks to a more manageable level, whereas in a head-to-head game, you only have 1 choice of who to attack.  It's a clever take on Dominoes, so we enjoy busting it out, but if we play with 2 players, we take breaks to calm down when we've suffered from our 6th dang bear attack!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice ideas with both the dominoes and the shelter/food dilemma... I was looking forward to trying this after reading the rules, but it felt that bears could be too strong in the 2-player game, and that the ability to reach caves and to get a good shelter point score may be too dependent on drawing the right tiles at the right time. 

I was left slightly disappointed, but would certainly play it again.

Tile Placement, it will never be my favorite gaming mechanism and this game won't change that. What is also a fact, that is there are no double tiles in this game. They made that a separate mini-expansion, but while you're playing the game, that simply feels as a miss, so by creating that mini-expansion, they fucked up there own base game. Therefore I also deducted 1 point from my rating. I simply hate it when they take parts from the base game, that should be part of the base game, for the simple reason as being able to create a mini-expansion.

I actually enjoyed my play of this much more than I thought I would. I wanted a video before hand(maybe that is why I wasn't expecting much- I never watch videos). This is a tile laying domino type game. Sounds boring but there is actually a bunch of interaction and attacks that might happen. Some planning involved. If I can pick this up I probably will. I have a bunch of fun with it. I definitely want to play again. Good family game too.

If a player tends to overthink the game Sapiens will absolutely put him into analsysis paralysis. Even placing the first scene (tile) will give you headache.

So: very very nice graphics (all tiles - even the similar ones - are different). That look is associated with easy family playability. But the game is exactly the opposite! It's a heavy strategical and sometimes tactical brain twister. Even if it looks solo at first you must keep an eye on what the opponents are doing, so you can interfere and plan around opponents grabbing tiles and planting bears in your valley. I really liked it,

I would never play this without the promo tiles. Even with them included, tile placement is too strict for this weight of game. You'll find yourself consatantly cursing as every aspect of this game is made to hurt your progress. The scenery powers are uninspired and encourage too much "take-that" against players. The art is beautiful, but I'd rather play Kingdomino for a light domino retheme game.

Very fun tile laying caveman themed game called Sapiens where each player places pictograms on his own cave/valley mat using a dominoes matching mechanic with a bit of player interaction thrown in for good measure. We are really having a good time with this one. Come on cavebears and mammoth steaks, what's not to love! Especially like the matching bonuses and how you must simultaneously balance food and shelter acquisition in order to achieve victory. Don't listen to Dice Tower on this one, it is really quite good for families, light and quick playing or as a game night filler. Love the paleo theme, love the artwork, love the twist on the dominoes tile laying mechanic. Between this game and Kingdomino I see no reason to play conventional dominoes any longer.

If this came out years ago, I might have really enjoyed it, but this just fell pretty flat to me. It's a pretty bland tile placement game, and I found it frustrating that you can often be searching for a particular tile or two that can really be of benefit to you - I think the tile placement is pretty limiting and just doesn't give you enough choices to make this very interesting.

This is a neat little tile-laying game. The tiles are domino style, with different pictures on each half. Each player has their own board, with a unique grid showing grasslands and forests (each worth 1-4 food). Several spots around the grid are seeded with a randomized set of tokens, each corresponding to a special power (same as the domino halves). Each player starts with a set of face up dominos, and another group is in a central display. On your turn, you play a tile, then draw a tile from the display, then replenish the display from supply. Playing a tile will give you some shelter and/or food, which are tracked separately on the score board. If you match domino-halves, you get to use the corresponding special power (e.g., play another tile, play a blocker on to an opponent's board, exchange a tile, etc.). Some plays will give you one of those tokens around your grid, which you can activate at any time to use its one-time power. When the game ends, a player's score is the lower of their food or shelter; most points wins!

I think it's a neat game, anyway -- we only played a teeny tiny part of it. I'll have to try this one again ....

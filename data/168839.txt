Innovative party - deduction game! It's minus is that it is much better with even numbers of players.

RATING: 6
A lot of the mechanisms are similar to Shadow Hunters, which I also own (someone sent this to me as an addon to something else), so I wasn't sure if it was going to be better or distinguish itself from the other game. I was worried about trying it out, because the reviews weren't super positive and it was sort of old. There was the chance that it wouldn't have aged very well.

On the whole, I would say that it is fine. I feel like the rules are written out longer than they need to be, though they're not too difficult to explain once you get them.

You have to pay a little more attention since the cost of being wrong is higher, because it seems harder to see everyone's card, and attacking isn't as mean so it gives less information. I generally would prefer that.

On the other hand, once everyone knows who everyone is and objects are out, one side can always choose which way a fight goes, and that will lead that side to win. Once one side is numerically inferior, there's just nothing they can do to get out of it for the rest of the game. You could probably come up with a fix by (for example) adding a dice roll and giving people a certain cost to helping in a fight, that slowly comes back. But then the game might become longer than it's welcome for....

So long as I have it and it's tiny to store, I might try and come up with some significant house rules that change how it is played and see if I can make it into a deeper game that really varies it from Shadow Hunters. At the moment, I'd say that it's not significantly different from Shadow Hunters, but I'd probably not recommend it over SH. More people will probably prefer the other game and, with them being so similar, you may as well do the one with easier rules unless you really want the smaller package.

I love hidden roles games so finally getting to play this was a joy. It seems more complicated (at first) than other games of this ilk but after a few rounds the information starts to flow and suspicion breeds.

This game is tough to teach. Has odd translation choices and seems very obtuse to new players. After a couple games it starts to become really enjoyable as people get better at picking their sides and starting struggles to gain objects.

A little confusing at first, but otherwise a nice hidden identity game. I don't like that the game mechanics allow someone to be picked on. I would rather play this with even teams; with odd number of players, it seems that the minority team has a too great disadvantage (although we won).

The Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg (usually renamed «The coach» for the sake of simplicity) is a great deduction game whose only downside is, it usually scares new players, who somehow feel like left alone against many: anyhow, in the end it never lets anyone down.

RATING: 4
A game played in teams with hidden membership with the goal of collecting a set of key cards. It's a cool idea and fun, unless the teams are unbalanced, which happens a lot because some card's abilities are very strong and if they happen to be on the same team, the other team is out of luck. This is also almost guaranteed to happen with an uneven number of players. And the bodyguard profession that adds one whenever you aid in combat (on attack or defense none the less!) is totally overpowered.

Played with 4 and it was very nearly a stalemate at the end of the game as two of us knew the answer, but we kept passing the "Black Pearl" card back and forth.  Finally, someone else figured it out to break the stalemate.  I think the game would play better with more people.  I want to play again with more and will update my rating after that.

At first glance, the rule seem incomplete one wonders how the game could become interesting. After 5-6 games with many players (> 5 players), the game is not that simple anymore and is suddenly interesting. Hopefully there will be an expansion, since there seems to still room for improvements.

Note that it is very cheap, nicely thematic and fills a niche of games for many players (6-10). Similar to Werewolf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Well, the theme is great, the art is gorgeous, and the rules are simple, but there's a lot of interesting subtle strategies you begin to see the more you play. It's an interesting mix of bluff and deduction that feels somewhat reminiscent of Inkognito. Like all card games, luck of the draw is a factor... but what's nice is that you can mitigate the luck by judicious trading (especially the secret bags) and well-planned attacks.

It's a little shallow so it's not something to play THAT often but it's great for a large even-numbered group. If you have an odd man out, best stick to something like Shadow Hunters.

The best 'hidden associations' game I know, and my favourite 'cooperative with a twist' game in general. The rules are simple, and while it is not obvious at first how to use such a limited selection of actions to win, usually the new players catch on quickly. Great fun, but really needs at least six players (and preferably an even number of them too).

Never played but read rules multiple times. The problem is its rule is a little fiddly, and perhaps will always play the Bang! series instead. Good thing is it's very portable and has both English/Chinese.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Too long for a fairly light social deduction game. Information is meant to be conveyed only through the actions, but it's very difficult to prevent some players unintentionally giving information away through their reactions and comments, which can seriously skew the game.

The art is nice, though. It's not a bad game: the race for information can be somewhat tense, and watching out for cues about allegiances in other players' actions is a bit interesting for a while. It's just not particularly good overall.

RATING: 10
Juegazo impresionante. Deducción y paranoia a partes iguales. Juego bastante friecerebros, al que no debes jugar con gente que no se lo tome en serio o no esté atenta. Hay que implicarse en el juego, y no tomárselo  a la ligera. Es un juego que, al terminar la partida, siempre suele haber una charla de como ha ido, que se hubiera podido hacer, y siempre deja un buen sabor de boca. Una maravilla. Ah, y relación calidad/precio infinita (versión Adlung-Spiele, la de Edge es muy cara). Mejor jugar con 6, es el número de jugadores que ofrece la mejor experiencia de juego. Si todos los jugadores son veteranos, a 5 también es bastante sólido, pero si te toca con el novato como único compañero de equipo... gg.

Played once.  Seems like a good game, although we bungled a couple of major rules which broke our play.  I'm looking forward to trying this again, with the proper rules.  This is a bit like Werewolf, but with much more game structure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I have played this once with an odd number of players. Drawing cards is very slow and it resulted in a game where one side won before there were enough keys in play to allow the other team to win. This is a little dissapointing however I think this would be rectified in a larger player number game as,
 a) it would last longer so more cards are drawn
 and
 b) more cards are initally dealt in set-up.
I think this has potential.

Gifted in 2014.

Comments copied from Castle of the Devil (I own this version, but don't feel like transferring over all the plays).

A really neat card game that is sort of a cross between Werewolf and Bang. Each player is on one of two teams and must discover who are his teammates and ensure that his team has the proper item to win. Nice deduction and player interaction. *UPDATE* Recommend NOT to play with 10 players unless the bonus cards are used. Took too long with less player interaction.

Erm... what? I had very high hopes for it, and I think there is a good game inside, but it was much less fun on my first play than I had expected. We played with nine, and four of my first five actions were thwarted, essentially meaning that I was behind in my information till the very end, and only had a vague idea what was happening. Coupled with long waiting times (too many players?), it was rather stale. I still liked the idea of it, and there is much interaction going on, but for the time being, I will just rate it a 6.5.

VERY similar to Shadow Hunters, so much so I would say if you own one you really don’t need the other, unless of course you like these kinds of games, then because they are so cheap why not. To be clear though, there are small differences, so what I am saying is they do exactly the same thing just a slightly different way. The main differences are how combat are handled, and in SH you can have neutral players so there can be 3 sort of teams instead of just 2.  

Both games everyone has a hidden identity, and you are trying to find out who is on your team. Here you have two options, trade an item with someone, or attack someone.  Here people have the option to support the attacker or the defender, which injects some info into the game, then depending on the result, if there is a winner they actual learn the identity of the loser so this also inject a BIG info point into the game.  

I think I prefer SH but I’ve only played this once so far and that one 6 times maybe, either way I am happy to own both since I really like these types of games and these two are a couple very good ones imho

What a GREAT game. First time we were only 3 or 4 players and the game wasn’t very good, but it really shines it you have 6 or more players on your hands. I have the game in a very high esteem and totally recommend it IF you like bluffing and secret roles games, which I love. This is a game heavy with negotiation and intrigue, I love how it let me manipulate other players. The tension during the game is always high because you aren’t sure who your foe and who is your ally. 

Also this jewel is very cheap. Buy it now!!

I still love it, although I have some trouble playing this with my current game group. I love hidden identities games but this is one of the best, I prefer it over Werewolf and The Resistance.

In our games, we always allow full open communication and we also play with the variant that we can declare victory if you know (or suspect :D) who and what objects have your enemies.

Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg has been in my Top Ten favorite games for years now. I really enjoy the game but I’m currently finishing my list of Top 100 favorite games, so I’m comparing the games in ways I never did before. Due to this,  Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg  just dropped from my Top Ten list, however I still have a high regard for it and I hope to play it until the day I die.

An interesting take on co-operative gaming in teams unknown to their members beforehand.

Hidden roles and social deduction. It works better with even number of players: 6 seems to be the best. The revised rules definitely improve the game play. Allowing no abstinence in duel provides more information for future decision making. The introduction of the duel token, which is given when your trade offer is declined, is also nice, since it encourages trade among players.

This doesn't work with 4 players - but I'm not sure does it even work with any number of players. A great example of games that I hate: a lot of different kind of action cards and game "locking" elements (I'll attack and all the others defend --> you don't get nothing).

 There are quite a few hidden role games. Many of them focus more on confrontation or direct interaction, but this one focus more on deduction and reasoning, and I think this is the reason I like The Castle of the Devil more. But it is not a pure deduction game, it involves a lot of interaction too, plenty of bluffing and a bit of memory.

You need one game to fully understand how to use the cards. You won't need to read the text in the second one, but you will still need more playing time to master it.

It reminds me of Shadow Hunters, but it definitly packs more meat. 

It is scalable, but I would say it shines with 6-8 or 10 players.

RATING: 5
First impression, oct 2009, (6 players): It's a game where two teams try to figure out who is who and can the team declare a victory. I kind of like the basic idea of just exchanging items (to collect information or help teammates) and attacking (either information or steal an item). You can declare victory if you can name 1+ person(s) [belonging your team] holding altogether 3 special items and at least 1 s.item per named player. There is some cleverness in it's mechanics.

However the game didn't feel like it worked too well. Information was scarce during the game and the game was too long (1h 20 minutes) given how much there was to do and how fun it was.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very interesting take on deduction. Nice artwork, too. Definitely the best value for money, and value for box size, for a long time. Optimal number of players is six.

Anyhow, has serious downtime problems with the wrong gaming group. Also, does not work that well with odd numbers of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really nice game, the complete asimmetricity of information is wonderful! A lot of tension. 
Its problems are:
- sometimes a player has already two items and the game ends quickly with the others wondering what had happened
- newbie players tend to be unsatisfied by their first game, because they have not understood anything, and will not want to retry it

German first edition has the English text written extremely small and lacks the extra tokens which mitigate luck

Not sure what to think of this, first play did not seem to work so well. It might be game´s fault, but also it might be that couple of players totally disliked the game. And it might also be the problem that on the first try it might not be clear how it should be played and what is happening.

Finally played this one. More deduction, less social. But a nice twist on a social deduction game. Almost all cards are known, so if you have almost all the items to win the game, you are about to get attacked. Only played 4 players. I'm assuming a 6-player game gets way better.

First plays should be with even numbers of players as one gets used to the game.  Takes a while to grasp what to do and how - (Early ties in battle to get more items into the game, then trade to find out who's who, what's where) - so be prepared for a bit of a learning curve until the light goes on.  A pretty compact hidden alliance game otherwise.

A big improvement over prior social deduction games (Werewolf, Bang) but not as good as more recent ones (Resistance, Blood Bound).

Two secret teams tfight to acquire ancient relics in order to subjugate their rivals... and the world. It is better to play with a high even number of players.

Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg.  Playing this for the first time was a hoot.  Rating could go up if next time it's a hoot again.  PS:  Unfortunately, and I mean VERY unfortunately, the fun in this game unravels if the rules aren't understood to the point of smoothness, and except for the first time I played, that has never happened.  I'm knocking it down from the 7.5 where it started in 2007 to the 6.5 where it stays until I get to play it again with people who know what they're doing.

[Adlung 2006 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; cooperation, variable-player-power, secret identity, voting, trading, deduction; optimal 6p} CttCR is a thematic party game. It is full of player interaction and is an enjoyable secret communication game. It is fun with a suitable group of players. The game mechanics are unique but it is not efficient enough to be great because the initial information exchange can be quite chaotic.  In addition, a game may last for more than 30 minutes; so it's only suitable for occasional play.

The graphics are stunning, though busy. I wish the English fonts were larger.

[Smuggler Variant]  I don't like this variant.  It reduces the tension and excitement of the game.  In addition, it slows down the game.

[Fortune-telling] This is quite good. It adds excitement to the game and could potentially shorten a game round.

An excellent hidden alliances game. Part of the Werewolf/Mafia family, but it's fairly unique in that both sides are evenly matched (ie, there is no informed minority). Everyone has their own secrets!

It has a solid amount of structure and game-ness that makes this less of a crapshoot than regular Werewolf, has no player elimination, and still manages to keep all the fun of a secrets and information game. 

Compared to Battlestar Galactica or Resistance, this game is one level more advanced - there is no default 'safe' behavior, which can make the early game quite impenetrable to the uninitiated.  

A great game, but NOT recommended for beginners to the genre.

Intriguing game of secret alliances.  Hard to figure out your first game; starts making more sense after that.  I don' feel like there's a lot of depth to the gameplay, but its fun.  Shadow Hunters is more fun and fits the same niche.
Update: The new rules improve the game a lot, especially playing combat cards face down rather than one at a time.

With 6 players, it was fun, although not the sort of thing I will ever love. My second game had 9 or 10 players, and it went on FAR too long and was generally no fun. My rating is for 6 players, although I expect 7 would be OK.

Excellent medium-to-large group game with 2 teams of players competing against each other.  The catch is that no one begins the game knowing who is on who's side, and so the game amounts to a neat balance of strategy, deduction, and conflict.  Quick to play, easy to teach, but first time players need to go over the FAQ.  It is very important to be open to trades early in the game, and then it moves along brilliantly.  It seems the new Castle of the Devil game re-implements this game with some extra rules / variations.

Still one of my favorite games when having a bit a bigger group. The deduction part is great as well as the hidden communication you can have with allies or the bluffing when trying to convince someone you're on their side while still trying to keep the most important items. I love playing this game when the group knows what they're doing, especially in the beginning it's just awesome to try and find out who your real allies are and who tries to deceive you. In the end most of the time it's a race. I had games were it was pretty straightforward which side would win because they started out better, had the right information earlier and were able to collect the right things, but we had games in which we thought the winner is clear and something suprising happened. And you can't always be sure what's in the hands of your allies to claim victory (yes sometimes you're sure, but sometimes not because time's running out or there's the risk of the other group claiming your victory). I've had a lot of fun with this game and the right people.

This was hampered by a confusing rules teach and actually would I think play better a second time around. Still, the game stagnated at parts when everyone was simply attacking each other in an attempt to gather needed information. I think the concept is interesting but the execution is poor and the game drags. This needed to play in 20 minutes - our game took 3 times that.

RATING: 6.5
So far, played with merely three, then five.  With more players, it was more dynamic and suspenseful, but the other team by game end had all six of the winning items, as well as the both bags which were counting as key and goblet by then, since all the items had been drawn.  So, I enjoyed it more than the first game, but gained a concern about how much players could simply be victimized.  I also am concerned that the smaller team lost in both odd-playered games.  Not much of a sample set to call it a trend, but I'm a little leery.

Still, it's an interesting take on deduction and collection, and doubtlessly, the art is incredibly beautiful.  I look forward to playing this more, and seeing what I think in the long run!  Some other players were asking where to buy it, so clearly it is not a fail.

I'm optimistic that it will rise to at least a 7 with further play, but if the concerns are confirmed, it could drop due to the knowledge that the gaming experience could be littered with unpleasantly helpless situations.  My guess is that with experience, the minority team will get even or perhaps an advantage, since 1/3 of their goal objects are face-up on the table for each player.

Tried this once and it didn't go over too well. I need to try again before solidifying my opinion, but have to see who I can get to play.
UPDATE: Played again and it was much better the second time. I think everybody was afraid to attack each other the first game and information was trickling in more slowly. I almost wish the attack wasn't called an "Attack", but rather "Spying" or "Espionage". It might encourage said action more.

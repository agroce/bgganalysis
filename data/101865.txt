A compelling and addictive warband-size tabletop game.  Each faction has a battle-board that provides interesting combinations of heroic abilities and a unique flavor.  Great game.

Very interesting command and control system, works well. Combat system is roughly the usual faire. The battleboard will be hugely popular, I predict a surge of new factions and eras using it. Well done to the designer.

Nuanced skirmish game led by innovative battleboard system, allowing for each faction/nation to be distinct and play in a culturally specific style.

What would have been a far too simple miniatures system is propelled into greatness by the battleboard and action dice giving all kinds of room for creative and flexible play.  Been playing this pretty solidly for 3 months and not tiring of it yet.

Excellent Dark age battle rules.  Dice mechanic allows for more varied play than something based solely on unit stats.

Great for solo play.

Eight of us are playing Age of Wolf campaign at Aberdeen War Games Club. Not having played Saga before I had my reservations about the battle-boards, but they certainly provide great variety as to how each of the different factions play out on the battlefield.
It doesn't take long to get to grips with how to use your specific board and how to combine options to destroy your opponent.
The scenario options are simple but create fantastic encounters - 'King of the Hill' is a slaughterfest whereas 'Escort and Protect' requires a completely different strategy.

RATING: 9
A very entertaining skirmish level miniatures battle game. The Battleboard mechanics do an excellent job of allowing tactical decision making, faction differentiation and imperfect battlefield control. The attack/defence and fatigue mechanics for combat resolution are also very good. 

I'm still uncomortable/unconvinced by measuring stick and the udginess that creates as to in-range/out-of-range and how many models can attacks etc - give me a hex grid thrown across the battlefield to make things more cut-and-dried but I am willing to accept it in this case given the quality of the rest of the game. 

Looking forward to building a couple of warbands and playing this some more.

This may be my favorite game...it's certainly my favorite minis game. The gameplay is excellent, with each faction operating differently based on their respective battleboard capabilities.  More fun and interestIng than historical, but it does have a strong dose of historical theme.

Good dark ages warband level (25-70somthing minis per side) miniatures wargame. Each faction has it's own unique abilities and play style wrapped up in a good resource management/activation mechanic. The best rules for fatigued troops that I've seen in a minis game with hardly any bookkeeping. Plays fast, good scenarios, plenty of bloodshed.

RATING: 8
A terrific game. Not completely historically accurate, but a VERY carefully balanced ruleset plus rules that consider skirmish tactics, armor, and weaponry from ~700AD makes for a fun game. Plus, there is all of the fun that follows from painting, primping and fussing over your 28mm miniature warriors and barbarians!

Beautifully presented set of rules.  Game has minimal book-keeping and the battleboard mechanics mesh well with traditional multi-dice combat.

RATING: 8
Saga has a great hook, with you being asked to manage a dice pool to both activate units and "power up" abilities to make your troops more effective in combat.  The basic mechanics are clean and easy, built around rolling large quantities of six sided dice to hit and save attacks, and army construction is dead simple.  There's an enormous amount to like here, but...

Javelins.  In my opinion, javelin equipped troops are so blatantly superior to those without that it distorts the game and makes it much less fun to play the armies which concentrate on good old fashioned hand to hand.  The problem is javelin troops have one point worse armor against shooting but not hand-to-hand, which manages to get the balance exactly backwards.

I have seen Saga, and it’s cousin, Saga: The Crescent and the Cross pretty heavily promoted in the miniature wargames press. I’d managed to resist temptation as I already have a grillion and three things to paint and don’t need to be starting yet another period.

The basic idea behind the game is pretty attractive in that it is a skirmish-level game where each side is led by a warlord and has a band of followers divided into groups of similar style soliders/warriors. They are controlled by allocation of battle dice onto the player mat. The battle mats are all faction specific, they have ‘common’ abilities available to all sides as well as specific characteristics that reflect the abilities of their particular side. As in all good games, there are never enough actions available to do everything so each side must prioritise their actions as well as attempt to outthink and anticipate their opponent. As I say, sounds good but do I need to start yet another new period?

My mind was changed when a chum suggested I might like to try a fan published variant of this game which is set in Middle Earth and uses the old Games Workshop Ltd. Battle Games in Middle-earth plastic and metal miniatures. As fate would have it, I have quite a few of these items. Unusually, many of them are painted and ready to go. The game also uses normal six sided dice rather than the expensive faction-specific bespoke dice that saga employs.

In my first game my heroic Uruk-hai faced the Riders of Rohan; the enemy archery was pretty effective (they have a faction-specific ability that boost their shooting range) but thanks to some hard fighting from my warg riders who caused enough of a distraction on the flank to allow the bulk of my force to close the gap I was able to get a unit of elite beserkers through and they chopped their way through the mounted hearthguard and then made short work of Theoden himself. Meat was back on the menu that night!

All-in-all it was terrific fun and I can see myself painting some of the half-finished miniatures lurking in the depths of my garage (assuming that I can find them again) with the intent of playing this every now and then. I also probably pick up a set of rules at some stage too.

RATING: 8
Even though Saga is a miniatures ruleset rather than a board game I'm surprised it doesn't get more recognition here given its huge popularity.

It's popular for a reason, Saga is a truly great skirmish ruleset.  Saga is well presented and written (they must have hired a professional editor rather than a wargamer who is pretty good at proofreading...).  The gameplay is simple and easy but the battleboard mechanic painlessly gives each faction a unique 'feel' to it.

Certainly my favorite skirmish ruleset out of the thirty or so rulesets I own for various periods.

Very nice histroical skirmish game set in the dark ages. This is what got me into historical games - and it's the only historical game I play now.
The idea of using special dice to determine what actions are available in a turn is great, and it's very easy to make flavoursome armies based on their different battle board options - especially since all the profiles are the same, it's just a matter of different weapons and battle boards.

One of my favorite miniatures systems. Simple rules, short games, a lot of customization, and... fun! What would give this game a '10' in my opinion would be offering up a starter set of painted minis to make this game more approachable to others The community is oddly small and the barrier to entry can be intimidating to people who don't want to deal with minis.

This really is a game. So many miniature games are just simply about concentrating force. The Battle Board is a very clever mechanic mixing limited activations, gamesmanship and some of the limited resource cards used in Richard Borg games. Army sizes are large enough to curb that hunger to paint yet small enough to remain manageable.

After a couple of plays, 1 as the Anglo Saxons and 1 as the Vikings the mechanics are starting to slot into place.  Seems like an interesting set of rules, quick playing but lots of thought and variation with the use of the battle board.  Need to get plenty more plays of this to get some more use out of the figures I painted up for it.

RATING: 10
Great dark age skirmish game with very original rules. After repeated plays the game continues to be fresh and unpredictable. The dice and battle board system provides many decisions for players to make and gives each faction its character. Even after three supplements all the factions are fairly balanced--something Warhammer players know is not easy to do. Looking forward to the next expansion and more factions.

Obviously a mater of personal taste.
I like my wargames to capture a feel of the era they're representing.

When I play a small dark-age battle, I look for shieldwalls or impetuous warriors, and  a heavy emphasis on mutual support.
What I got was clumps of specialised troops, poring over a sheet of close typed text (very un-dark age), and an endgame with the two bosses brawling and hardly any warrior survivors.

The fatigue mechanism is simple, and in keeping with the portrayed era.
It unfortunately seems to exacerbate some of the more cartonish aspects of the system.

Not what I was looking for at all.

Played 3 times and really enjoyed it every time. To get good at this game, you really need to learn your army's battle board and dice combos. 

I need to acquire a 2nd army (Saxons, Danes, Normans, or Bretons?) to go with my Vikings so I can get my war game group to play this very well-regarded and innovative dark ages battle game. 

I think my rating for this might go up to 10 with further plays to really "grok" it.

Nice mechanics for a light wargame though some turns I felt like there wasn't much to do if you rolled poorly. It didn't help that the opponents I had for this game were into power gaming during learning games and it left a bad impression. Have since sold this stuff on.

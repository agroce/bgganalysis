Wow. This could very well be my FAVORITE three-player-only game yet. Tight, balanced, multiple paths to victory, and never a dull moment whatsoever. From the very beginning, everyone is in everyone else's face. There's literally no breathing room, and it's like this to the end of the game. Many options each turn and a constant struggle makes this a game that's going to keep appearing again and again.

A great euro/wargame hybrid, and three player as well! This game features a great set of mechanics that mesh very well. Each player chooses a path, but if you aren't well-rounded in play you'll give the game to someone else. I'm definitely planning on picking this one up once Z-man releases it this summer. UPDATE: this is an incredible game of tension and balancing. I really want to keep playing this with the same group of three to really uncover the depth of the game. Fantastic!

A fun, designed for 3, Waro.  Some ways to win appear easier than others and the rules make the game appear more complex than it is, but I do like this very much.  My group may end up doing a minor tweak or two to adjust the competence win....when you can figure out how to do that.

Wargame ligero (o eurogame con luchas) con temática romana. Componentes muy bonitos para uno de los mejores juegos para 3 jugadores. Mucha tensión y diversión con alianzas temporales y diversos caminos para alcanzar la victoria (militar, política o una mezcla de las dos), y un tiempo de juego no demasiado alto.

This is a tough one.  It plays well enough (the rules could be about four pages shorter), but it is a very unforgiving game.  If one player makes a mistake the next player wins.  The winning conditions seem to be too easy and thus every move can easily lead to defeat.

RATING: 5
Great theme, but this game leaves me cold. I like the basic idea, but some typical euro mechanics ruins the game for me.

Why are certain areas designated as political and others as military. I don't get it.

Why are defeats on the battlefield awarded with a better chance next time? Why do you lose political support when you become a consul? I understand! Players that falls behind needs to keep up.

Besides the market demands for these kind of games that can be played in a short amount of time. To me these games are meaningless, if they don't portray the historical event properly.

Interesting, and like the fact it's designed for exactly three. After 2 plays, looks like it can come down to fixing on a strategy and, if you think you can win with it, racing to victory, if not, blocking opponents who are on course to win sooner. Starting to see how you need to resource-deprive opponents. I still think military is a touch weaker because you can only attack one opponent or the other, but I'll have to try a military strategy.

Very good. Fast-paced, relatively simply conquest / influence game which appears to be tense and closely fought throughout. Towards the end it seems important to keep the player immediately to your left in check. Not overly keen on the wooden blocks and the board could have been bigger.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play.

Our first game didn't go so great, as one player quickly conquered their way to an anti-climatic military victory.  We forgot a rule or two, but most importantly I don't think we understood how to properly play the game.  It caught us off guard.

I'm eager to try it again though.  The rules are simple and there's very little luck, but there appears to be some depth here with the multiple paths to victory.  I also like that it's specifically designed for three players.

RATING: 6
This is a fun game, and could be very good with the right crowd.  It's the kind of game where you really have to keep an eye on what your opponents are up to, and because of that, I would not want to play it with just anyone.  Because of the qualifier, I give it a 7/10, but with perceptive players who know what is going on, it is better than that.

This is a quite simple game to play mechanically, but is quite intricate in execution.  The balance and ultimate game experience requires that the players all have roughly equal game play experience (not necessarily with this game).  If the players are out of balance relative to each other, the game will follow suit as it does not have any auto-correcting features.  Like many / most 3 player games, it is important not to have a battle between 2 players with the third sitting by.  If you do, the by-stander will most assuredly win.

RATING: 5.5
Unusually, a biggish game for three players max.  Appeared well balanced.  Maximum four rounds, as at the end of each round a konsul is elected and owning two konsuls is the political way to win the game.  As I played last in the 4th (and 1st) round I stopped spending half way through the game, accumulating 14 of the 15 gps so that only I could buy konsuls (on the last turn of the game and so that no one else could re-use the money).  As a player’s last territory could not be attacked I retained enough armies to secure a political area, which allowed me to obtain a second konsul and win.  The other players had to maintain equal territories (6 or 7) or lose the game. Consequently there appeared no way for my opponent’s to win with almost half the game remaining.

Suggested solutions:  (1) a gp limit of, say, 6 gps.  (2) allow player’s last territory to be attacked (but not taken over) to reduce armies and therefore ability to capture a political area if one not already held.  (3) A variable ending – say three tiles laid on the last three places on the turn track.  These are flipped when reached.  Only one signifies the end of the game.  Therefore the timing of the vote is not certain and if konsuls are bought on any turn but the last the other players could also acquire konsuls.

A couple of games in with the same players and this sure seems like a winner.  So much to balance with so many (three) ways to achieve a victory.

I enjoy that each of the civilizations are set up to progress differently and that they have the ability to switch their focus throughout the game.  

Caesar has won both games through a military victory, but luckily it wasn't the same player each time.  I do wonder about balance issues, but I have only played twice.

Remarkably tight 3-player euro-wargame covering the Roman civil war between Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus. A precarious balance between political and militaristic concerns frame the decisions that players are tasked to make. Will you win an outright victory through military conquest? Will you harness the will of the people to support you politically? Or will you pursue a path which raises the stature of your fighting forces and poltical acumen until you become the ultimate soldier/statesman? Dirt simple economic, movement, combat, and political rules allows new players to jump into the heart of the game quickly. Playtime is far below what you might expect for a game with a Roman Civil War theme, too. And for a game that is designed for just three players, it has few peers. While the production values for the game itself are fine, the box art and copy are real turn-offs. But don't let it stop you from trying it!

Hard to figure out what to do at the beginning.  Suffers from the standard problem with 3 player wargames where 2 fighting players who ignore the 3rd player will lose to the 3rd player.  Seems like the best approach is to spend all your cash to move up your military & political influence markers (for the low, low price of $3 per turn, you can move them twice)... getting both influence markers to the top will make you the winner (by roughly the end of the 2nd year or beginning of the 3rd and final year).  Of course, it's not a fool-proof approach... there's the messy business of preventing your opponents from winning by political victory (2x voted to the council) while you slowly chug your way to balanced victory.

I love this period and saw it on a clearance shelf. After checking the geek-buddy analysis and reviews, and always on the lookout for a pure three player game (they are rare), I took a flyer on this.

It hasn't hit the table yet so I don't have much to go on as far as rating this game goes, so I've put a marker down and hope to raise the rating with play experience.
+++++
Got a chance to play and it proved to be an interesting experience. Three leaders balance military and political influence (or a combination of both) to work toward a position of supremacy as measured by territory (military conquest), political influence in the senate in order to be elected Consul (one election in each of up to four years - win twice and you've won the game), or a combination of both military and political competence (which have their own measurement tracks). Reach any one of the three thresholds and the game is yours.

You have to watch your opponents like a hawk and when a player gets an edge toward meeting any of the three victory conditions, both of the others must act decisively. Sudden victory can appear out of the blue if you are not paying attention from the very start. Even though the game can last four "years" neither of our games went much past two. On the other hand, we were just getting on to the dynamics - with experienced players I expect slightly longer games (even a full game won't take much more than an hour and a half).

It is a challenge to design a pure three player game, involving a lot of player interaction (as this one has), to not end up as an elimination match where two players knock out a weak sister and then go at it one-on-one. Here, there were times when two had to bring a leader back into line but the temporary alliances did not last and it could be that a formula for a working three player game is possible after all.

The game is not all that complicated but there is a learning curve to fully understand the dynamics. Turns move quickly yet there are moments of tension and decision-making which hold your attention. You can't afford to snooze during the other players turns and thanks to the short downtime it is not a serious concern. The theme is primarily atmospheric as the scenario is introduced in the foreword to the rules and tends to submerge as the play gets going. As such, the game feels more like a Euro than a war game - all the elements, particularly conflict, are handled in the abstract.

I will need more plays to be sure if this will be a keeper but the first couple were encouraging.  Bumping up the rating a tad...

I want to like this one more than I do. It works great as a 3 player which makes it worthy for the collection on its own. Period interests me, so this should be a solid 10, but its not - the game is too abstract and mechanical, and the components don't help the theme either - I want to be moving a representation of a leader not a big slab, I want to be moving legions around not cubes. but overall it's a keeper that should see some play when there are just 3 of us.

RATING: 7
A really difficult to handle game. Not because of the game meachnism, they are smooth and nice. The art of deciding which action is the best for you, but don`t hurt the other too much, because the third picks up the fruits of your work or can work undisturbed for the victory. The game has three different winning conditions, which are imo all equal to achieve.  You  always have to look paranoid on two sides. This Trinangle thinking can give u a headache but is the pepper in this gamesoup.

Definitely a game of balancing advancing yourself and knocking down the other guy. Inferior play can easily king make. Very good game. It will take more plays to decide, but I think it's a keeper. (each play took about 30 minutes so I think the 60 minutes on the box is definitely reasonable)

I really tried to like this game as the theme is one that I like. But it left me with mixed feelings. Doesn't give me the right like felling and felt rather dry after we played it.
The aftermath fealing was more towards being a dud game.
Have the feeling there are so many other games to play, so I can't see this getting played more in a very long time.
This was the unanimous fealing in the three player game.

As has been said - a knife fight in a phone booth - and it requires a nimble approach.  Lost to someone's political victory - one short of a competence victory myself, while the third player came up a province short of the military victory.  All of us were new players to the game, and would love to play again.  Pure Euro in mechanic, tough to avoid conflict.  Much simpler to play then it is to read, recommend a practice turn or two to work through the mechanics.

RATING: 6
A clever design. Only played once and we were pretty dovish. Lots of consolidation first. I would have liked Italia getting its real due. Grabbing Italia and the Urbs romana ought to be more of a catalyst for military action. Such "Crossing of the Rubicon" would have romped up the excitement level.

Anyway, an intriguing game. A wonderful addition to game cabinets lacking in good three player games. 

What makes me rate it a not really remarkable 7? I find it hard to put my finger on it. Though I attribute it not being an "hit" on my first playing to no little degree to the rather lukewarm response and atmosphere around the table. I think this is a "personality driven" game. Diplomacy-type players ought to enjoy it most. A three-player configuration obviously only works out if players are ruthless in switching "alliances". "Carebearism" spells the death to such games. I hope I'll get the right sort of fellow players to the table sometime soon. And then, we might well have a blast.

BTW, I see in this design the rudiments for a "Republic of Rome light". Definitely a design project I hope to see materializing some day. 

UPDATE: Repeated play of this one really hasn't made me wildly enthusiastic about it. Nonetheless a solid game.

RATING: 3.5
Woah… This is supposedly one of the best eurogames for exactly 3 players (i.e. it only plays 3 players – yes, there is a 2p variant, but nobody recommends that), but it was so bad! If the game actually played like it sounds, it could be somewhat interesting as there are three paths to victory, and you win instantly if you achieve any of these, so there are basically 6 ways you can lose the game against two opponents. However, in our two games the military seemed like the much better way to go, and that is probably the way we play it, although my two opponents are definitely not gamers who are usually fans of conflicts and attacking each other. So, yeah, maybe we played poorly, but in our two games it just seemed that the military way was the way to go. Maybe we played it too confrontational and wanted to capture each other’s territories in order to get more income ourselves, but there you have it. If I ever play it again (which I highly doubt) I’m going to (almost) never attack and just keep 6 military units in my territories in order to really chase the non-military victory – which I also tried in my second game, but suddenly the military victory was within reach and I had to go for that instead.
Oh, and I really don’t get the point in games that limits themselves to a specific number of players (except 2p games like Chess and such), it feels like a wasted opportunity. Perhaps they decided to make it a 3p only game in order to bore fewer people, and in that case I applaud this decision! There are many, many, many games I would play before playing this one again.

A war game that feels very zero-sum, or enclosed, not sure if thats the right word.  Every decision you make feels like your pushing somewhere and losing somewhere else - and your never sure if its the right decision.  Its a lot of fun and there is some major leader bashing going on.  Plays quickly and is quite a bit of goodness for a 3 player wargame.

Un juego muy bien pensado y equilibrado que solo es para tres jugadores, un numero curioso y que no se da muy a menudo. Es un eurogame puro donde no se da el efecto que tienen los juegos de conquista, dos se pegan mucho y el tercero gana. Aquí las alianzas duran pocos turnos y cada uno debe tener clara la estrategia que seguirá durante la partida. Supongo que con tres jugadores experimentados las partidas deben ser muy tensas. Tengo que volver a probarlo pero de momento las impresiones son buenas.

Very well executed and masterly balanced 3p dominance game with a reasonable historical flavor. Love the multiple win conditions, resource management and simplicity of the game. Gives me the same feeling in 1 hour as Maria in 5 (well, not true, Maria is a better game, but still). Very easy to get to, and very replayable, without resorting to the "special abilities" cop-out.. Highly recommended, just stick to it for 2-3 games before deciding if you like it or not. 2p works fine too, although it misses quite some action, naturally.

I love the idea of the tightly balanced 3p political war game. I like the level of abstraction here. Its just that the actions taken on the first turn seem obvious and scripted, so that I think the game maybe doesn't replay well. Also, there is a strong reliance on all three players having a good sense of the win conditions at all times and being willing to attack the leader and trust that you won't be attacked if you're trailing. If someone misjudges, they give the game away.

RATING: 5
Lookout has lept onto my radar after 2004's Zepter and their new effort, Das Ende des Triumvirates, is also a worthy release.

The principal idea behind Ende is the political intrigue between the 3 members of the original Triumvirate, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompeius for control of the Empire. Each player takes the role of one of these characters, and then attempts to win via military, political, or a combined approach.

The engine of the game is fairly easy to understand: most regions produce resources every other turn (legions or gold) but the gold only goes into the player's personal coffers when they can get their character to the region to collect it. Combat is simple, fast, but effective. There is a bag of "weapons" which has a variable number of cubes from each character in it. When a combat starts the number of forces on the smaller side is checked. This number of cubes, to a maximum of 3, is pulled from the bag before combat which can cause some troop losses for one or both sides. Then it's a simple war of attrition: 1 for 1 trades, whoever has pieces left wins and takes control. If at any time you control 9 areas then you win.

The other mechanic is the political end of things, and this is one of the places where money comes in. Money can be used to either buy more cubes for the pre-battle draw, or to buy votes. There are a finite number of electors, and if they are all bought then one can pay to have them defect from someone elses camp. After each 8 rounds there is an election, the person with the most votes in their camp wins. If you are elected twice in the game you win. 

The final way to win is a sort of combined approach. To quickly sum it up, you can invest money to make cubes cheaper to buy for the bag, or to make votes cheaper to buy and if you ever get both of the tracks completely maxed out then you can win that way as well.

All 3 of the winning methods seem viable, and there is a considerable amount of tension as players jockey back and forth to keep one another from getting too much of an advantage. The game also has the virtue of having a lot going on, yet being relatively easy to play after a round or so.

After my initial play, the urge to hit this up again hasn't risen, and I have to wonder about any game that falls flat with me in that way, particularly something like this, which fills a specific niche that I could use a game for. I think Ende ultimately fails in some ways, for me, simply because it doesn't offer a hook to differentiate itself beyond the 3 player aspect. Everything else is borrowed, and as well as the system fits together, it just isn't standing out as something worth pulling off the shelf.

A very, very good game that has the potential to be great if it survives a few plays and doesn't fall victim to the usual Eurogame fatal flaws of repetitive and ultimately shallow gameplay and too much dependency on mechanics and structure over strategic flexibility.  EotT is probably a good bet for wargamers and other folks who like the hybrid Euros like Wallenstein or Friedrich (both games I love myself) as it continues that welcome trend of wedding Euro-like simplicity and structure to games that allow direct conflict and real competition rather than auctions or other beat-into-the-ground tropes.  The game is insanely tense, every move is significant and the highwire mechanics work to heighten the drama rather than introduce gamey, artifical mechanics to satisfy balance-crazed Eurogamers like the worst Martin Wallace games tend to exhibit.  Multiple strategies to win, a punch-me-I-punch-you-back pacing, and a fairly decent degree of theming that agrees with the rules and mechanics make this a very promising contender and even at an early stage I feel fairly safe to say that this is probably the best Euro in many years.  Complaints so far are few- I hate the Euro production style, what with the tiny board smeared in what appears to be Georgia red clay, mustard,and dishwater.  I also think that cardboard chits or miniatures  would have served the game MUCH better (while also providing atmosphere and character) than more stupid f**king wooden cubes, cylinders, and planks.  Definitely looking forward to trying it again- for a 45-60 minute, three player game it might be one of the best in its class- a full, satisfying game that's definitely not a "filler".

This game has an elegant balance to it that has me in awe.  Strike one of your opponents too hard, and you quickly exhaust yourself while strengthening him greatly.  The odd number of players (2-3) means that it probably won't be played quite as often, but it's still one of my new favorites.

RATING: 6
Suffers from the awkward 3 player war game problem: it's possible to create a balanced and tense game where all three players are attacking each other and all three players have nearly equal chances at victory.

It's also possible (and easier) to create a semi-stable game situation, where two players viciously attack the third, making it impossible for the third player to win.  The only consolation that third player has is that they get to be kingmaker . . .

Most of my (limited number of) games of this have played out like the latter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a really neat little 3 player Roman Empire Euro/Wargame. There are several aspects of the game that I particularly like. First, there are several avenues for victory. You can win by straight out conquest, by political victory, or by merely by "competence", which means you develop your leader's skills to the max. The other thing that I find interesting is the "Battle Bag" where you draw "Weapon" cubes during battle. Also, things like balance, easy of play, short duration, and little down time really make this an intriguing Euro/Wargame Hybrid (more Euro).

Another game in the Euro/War blend category.  Favors Euro, although it's structured like a wargame.  Moving and attacking is only one way to win, however and not necessarily the most efficient.  Conquering territories is important, but controlling and holding the territory is not necessarily so.  Interesting.  The balance amongst the paths of victory seems very strong.  Only concern so far is kingmaker situations, which seem inevitable in most games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one of those "multiple paths to victory" kind of games (not terribly dissimilar to Antike in that regard). You can have a military victory, a political victory, or a "competence" victory. Turns are pretty quick and straightforward. Combat is simple, like Antike, but with a slight random element known as "weapons" (sort of like the Wallenstein tower). With three players, you of course have to beware of the fact that attacking someone probably is most advantageous for the player not involved at all. But it all seems to balance out, as there are rewards for attacking, and even compensation for being attacked. I think what I learned from my first game is that no matter what you do, it%u2019s going to be close, so what%u2019s important is thinking about how you%u2019re going to make an end-game push. I like it a lot.

The theme is completely pasted on and at times the game feels almost abstract. It is perfectly balanced vicious game for three players, which suffers from strong inherent kingmaking potential - roughly similar level of ability and knowledge of the game is a must. Still, describing the game as a knife fight in the phonebooth doesn't do the game justice. I would rather describe it as a three-way shiv fight in an aircraft lavatory. The conflict is not only unavoidable, there is nothing else in the game. Unsurprisingly, this is one of those games that can make people really angry. I have seen some well adjusted individuals burn with hatred when playing the End of the Triumvirate. In this regard the game is lot like the good old Diplomacy.

A very good three player political wargame. It is very rare for a game with a lot of conflict to work for three players, but this one does, and it does exceedingly well. There are many paths to victory, lots of interaction (the battle system is especially ingenious), relatively simple and intuitive rules, and a short playing time for such a deep game. This really is a marvel of game design. The only pity is that it doesn't play more than three, and that two player game is not nearly as good.

Players take on one of the roles of the "big three" Triumvarate during the years 60-54BC, and juggle with each other for ultimate power over Rome.  Apparently they couldn't settle their differences at Luca, and went for each other.  A very simple 2 or 3 player game of conquest and political management, where players pursue one of three spheres of victory.  A turn is simply draw supplies (legions and money), move your leader (suck up legions, money and possibly attack), and then take special actions depending on where your leader finishes (purchase military/political expertise, senate influence, or weapons for the army).  The game takes about five minutes to explain, and just over an hour to play.     Excellent stuff.

VERY GOOD 3 player game. simple rules with little luck. Unexpected empire building game that plays in 2 hours.

My rating has room to go up or down (less likely) with additional plays, but I think it will be a solid 8.

A real gem.

After additional plays, I've dropped my rating from an 8 to a 7, since the last four games have been decided by
the same mistake (the player in 2nd/3rd attacking the leader and leaving an unseen opening that allowed the other player to win). There just may not be enough margin of error in the development of each individual game to allow the game to come to the natural conclusion of the best player winning on merit.

This is an interesting multi-player conflict game with many different end game conditions.  It's also interesting that it plays best with 3.  Typically in multi-player conflict games either two people fight amongst one another and the third player wins or two people gang up on the third and then battle one another.  It's still possible in this game but I feel it's less likely and harder to do this.  Overall I like this game and I like that you can try to win via military or political means.  I have to try it again as we had played with the incorrect rules on our first play by not receiving supplies from Rome.

War games are really not my bag.  This isn't a full bred war game, it's also very Euro, but it's war game enough for me to shy away from it.  The good news is that the combat is pretty simple (no dice), and there are mechanics to move the game along so it does not drag on.  The paths to victory seemed fairly well balanced, but I don't think you can win without either attacking somebody or being attacked, which is why I give it a 6.  I would have given it lower, but there are some decent rewards for being attacked, which did take some of the edge off.

RATING: 7
The game has a very appealing beginning - not sure about the end.  The game looks great and offers some tough choices from moment one.  It was more abstract than I expected.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect the same thematic sense of Mediterranean sea and troop movements as in Serenissima.

The endgame is dicey.  If each player has been careful to prune back the leader, you will probably end with all three players one turn from winning every turn.  At this point, the game becomes enormously tactical.  It's not a kingmaking problem - each player must stop the next player from winning, and the next the next, and so on.  Given this reality, there is a clear need to spend a lot of time working out the overall best way to stop the next player and improve your own position so that you can't be stopped when it gets back to you.  It's different, but invites problems, including the possibility that someone will win because a second player has not noticed or incorrectly calculated the nascent victory opportunity.  The game should, however, get some credit for tackling the three-player problem.

I love the look, especially the austere power of the flat wooden leader markers.  Thank god nobody insisted on some needless plastic dolls.  The game looks kind of like a troop movement diagram from a history textbook, to great effect.

They obviously put a lot of thought into the 3 player game.  I love the balancing effect of the compensation card.  The game was a lot lighter than I expected, and the relatively small number of territories was initially offputting, but it was a great time with 3.  Not sure how it would work with 2, though.

After additional plays, I wonder whether the initial setup leads to a programmed outcome.

German and English editions. Based upon my first play (all newbies). Super 3-player game. I figured I was out of the running but may have won on my turn if the player just before me didn't sneak out a political win by having been elected counsel and then buying 3 more citizens to get him to 6 in his area. The player before me didn't really see the political win coming and worked to halt me. It's great fun to point out the advantages of the other player and urging the 3rd player to take him out before it's too late.

An excellent euro-style wargame for three players. It has a somewhat "mechanical" feeling (not unlike, say, Wallenstein) that may not please die hard wargamers, but for me it worked quite well. You may be leading in 2 of the 3 victory conditions but lose anyway. This is cool in some ways, but can also cause some concerns because, unlike the "political" and "military" victory conditions, the "proficiency" condition is almost unstoppable.

RATING: 6
A nicely balanced 3-player Wargame/Euro hybrid with three different win conditions. Since you cannot pursue all avenues it's likely each player goes for one of the three so the problem becomes getting to your win condition faster and/or preventing the others from reaching theirs. Which is, of course, much easier said than done. A bit dry and not too pretty to look at but moving quickly, and since turtling is impossible, constantly and inevitably heading towards a resolution.

This is a very nice and elegant game designed for three players. The cubes are taken from the bag for battle resolution, but it is possible to mitigate luck by adding cubes of your color with an action. Defeated players add a cube of their colors to the bag increasing the odds to the next battles, which works as a catch-up mechanism.

I haven't played it enough to know if it'll go the distance but my initial impression is it's a good 3-player light game. So, for those times when we only have 3 players and need warm up game, this will fit right in. (And save me from having to play Munchkin or Carcassone!) I doubt there is enough content here for it to be the flagship game of the day but that's ok, there's always room for another quality role-player.

I appreciate the elegance of this game. Unfortunately it's completely not for my taste. The game is good, dynamic and fast-paced. It mixes in a unique way some wargame and eurogame elements.

A great game that is brilliant with three and terrible with two - don't even go there. But with the right group of three it's a first rate gaming experience as uneasy alliances are made and broken in a continual attempt to hold back the perceived leader.

RATING: 7
Very neat game for 3P.  One potential annoyance is that each of the three starting positions is geared toward one specific victory condition (of three).  You need to challenge one of the other conditions to keep an opponent in check, but going for it outright seems unlikely to win.

RATING: 7
It seems like achieving a military victory is tough.  Based on the starting positions of players, does this put Pompeius at a disadvantage since his starting placement tends to favor a legion buildup.  Granted, he can attack Crassus and take a territory even before Crassus takes his first turn.

Personally I enjoyed the game, but the jury is still out for others.

A reading of the rules leaves me skeptical.  It sounds like one of those games where each player has his slice of the pie and everyone polices the game to keep any one slice from growing too large, until one player finally surges successfully to the victory threshold.  I generally dislike that type of game.  However, it sounds very solid mechanically and is getting some good reactions, so I'd like to try it.  I missed my chance at Great Lakes Games, so I'll probably have to wait until Gulf Games in February.

We eventually came to a point where the current player had to make a decision - let the next player in line win or stop him and let me win on the new turn.

Tightly balanced. Could succumb to scripted opening moves given that the set-up positions and turn order are fixed.

Excellent 3 player game. It's balanced enough to ensure that the each player needs to be aware of both other players and that the weakest player at any point isn't likely to be picked for fear that the other strong player will taken even more advantage & win. Definitely want to play more of this.

RATING: 6.9
It should be played with 3 players but last player in first round (if attacked both times) has a distinctive disadvantage. 3.5 different winning conditions but one of them is easier as others. It's the "If you were once Consul and have 6 citizen at any time in the Forum you win instantly." This enables players to have "surprise winnings" (= did all he needed in one turn). This sucks. The 6 citizen rule should [i]not[/i] be "at any time" but "at the end of the round (Elegio)". Furthermore the game suffers a bit of "first player acts, following players often only react". This lessens the options player two and three actually may/should choose.
Otherwise a solid designed game where you have to carefully choose where (and when) to engage (military/political/competence). Low luck factor but still present in battles.

(3 plays, 3-player) Seemed to be a very balanced game for three players, which can be rare. Each player begins with slight advantage in one of three categories (based on board position), but there are also three different ways to win. Many checks and balances between players, and the end comes very quickly. Best of all, even with new players learning the rules, this game played in less than 90 minutes. Very good game. My game group plays this game a bit slower than the guys I learned it from, but I still find it a solid game.

RATING: 5
2-player is a good learning exercise, but not great as it is mostly just bash, counter-bash, counter-counter-bash, etc.

3-player, on the other hand, is quite excellent.  Each player, due to their starting position, has a unique character without special rules.  With three ways to win, and the tension due to the three players preventing constant attacks, I could see many potential strategies to win, and thus a lot of replayability.

This is really the only 3-player conflict game that I have played that works.  2v1 team games, or 3-way passive competition (Formula De, Ticket to Ride, etc.) work, but every 3-player conflict game except this one seems to fall into a pattern of 2 players get into conflict, followed by the third (vulture) cleaning things up.  Or, two people gang up on 1 person, who then has a miserable game.

The idea of compensation for lost provinces, along with your final province being immune to attack, allows for a lot of action without ganging-up and vulturing being large problems.

Sold after two games. I enjoyed them, but a few flaws let me down in the end. The first game ended early with a "competence victory", and the second one almost saw the same kind of victory after a new player decided to pursue it only after a few rounds. That victory condition seemed too much easier to achieve than the other two, and it's a lame one. Compensation for losing two provinces in a row was too strong, also promoting that victory condition. I don't like the production very much, either: functional pieces and board, but very dull components (yes, wooden cubes!) and ugly map. And just a question: Can anyone explain me how losing a battle makes your military competence go up?!

Fast playing three player wargame/euro hybrid.  Lots of good decisions in a simple rules set with conflict on every turn.  Multiple paths to victory and slightly different starting positions make the game interesting.  It will fail if all players do not know (and watch) the victory conditions.  Military victory seems sort of tough to pull off because it is so easy for the other players to jump in and stop you, while the skill victory (military and political track) seems hard to prevent since there are not many ways to stop someone from advancing on this track.  Maybe more experience will make the military victory seem better.  Its a great game, so I hope to play it a few more times and see how it pans out.  The map and tiles are pretty attractive, but the wooden cubes, wooden tubes, and wooden squares are a little disappointing.  The game calls out for miniatures for each of the leaders, colored buildings to show control, and maybe some jazzing up of the cubes.

A nice-looking game with impressive theming. I liked the alternative strategies of moving along the political or military tracks (or both). The battle system works well, but there seems a tendency to get into a "you push me and I'll push you back" mindset, especially since it is difficult to attack without leaving at least one of your provinces vulnerable. This means players can get too focused on the military aspect, making it easier to win through the political track. Also, one person can easily get knocked out of the running if the other two "team up" to some extent.

After a single play I am undecided, leaning towards "I think I like it", but have concerns.

The biggest concern is that after the first couple of turns your moves are more about "what I have to do to stop the person who comes after me" than anything else. That kind of left-right binding is something that I don't like at an intellectual level. At least I tell myself that. Maybe I don't actually care in practice?

I really like this one.  Kind of a "specialty" game in that its designed for exactly 3 players.  That being said, it's a solid choice when we have the right 3.

The mechanics of the game are such that you will almost always have a very tight game - in that there is compensation for losing military battles and winning an election costs you supporters heading to the next election.  And of course, whoever is closest to one of the three victory conditions becomes an obvious target for the other two players.  It's very hard to "run away and hide" in this one.

My only minor knock is that the game occasionally feels a bit over-engineered at times (with regard to keeping the game tight).

Three-player game set at the time of the 1st Triumvirate.

DEdT is a fine example of how a wargame looks when designed as a German game: The rules are very simple and clean, the components are beautiful, and the whole is about as elegant as a German game can be.

Not only is this a three-player wargame that actually works: On one hand a number of equalizers and compensations help balance the game, on the other the game features no less than three ways to win, of which military conquest is only one (political victory and maxing out your personal competence being the other two).

DEDT gets a big recommendation from me: It looks great and plays beautifully!

Love that it's for 3.  It's all about checks and balances then, 2 players making sure 1 isn't getting too far ahead.  I've seen each victory condition fulfilled though which was cool. Ending can be anticlimatic if 1 person makes a bad move.  Best when played with 3 similarly-minded players.

1 solo and 1 ftf game (in which I crashed and burned after a silly mistake in the first turn).

If you don't like confrontation and table talk this won't be for you, but if you do and have (exactly) two other friends I recommend this. 

3 player wargames can often seem a little unbalanced due to two players picking on the third (or the third profiting from the first two beating each other up). This however has a number of balancing mechanisms - not the least of which is everyone keeping an eye on the others and shouting up if one seems to be getting ahead.

There are a number of nice original mechanisms in here, such as the way that a player's potential financial actions are determined by the type of territory on which he ends his turn, the senate, and the competency tracks. The 3 (3.5 really) different victory conditions keep options open.

A very balanced three player game.  My only concern is that it's _too_ balanced - it seems that every game I've played so far has ended with each player one play from winning, and perhaps the endgame will always be a cycle of hit-the-leader, with the winner being the last one standing.  

That being said, I have immensely enjoyed my three plays of this game.  The multiple paths to victory are a plus.

Very balanced game that requires you to plan out your path to victory while keeping your opponent in check. Timing out when to attack an opponents leader to gain your best advantage is critical.

I really wanted to like this game, as I play three-player games primarily. I had a few big issues with it unfortunately. 

1) The game is weighted against a military victory. This gives Pompius a real disadvantage. First off, the other players, if they have any sense, can simply scoop up the fallen legions from Pompius' wars and easily starve him of troops. Also, since battle has a good deal of luck involved, Pompius must also be extremely lucky in the cube draw to make headway. The neutral cubes give a huge advantage to the defender. And since he has less income from his starting provinces, he doesn't stand much of a chance of keeping pace on the other victory tracks.

2) Because battles are so costly and ineffective, the game seemed to be an exercise in hording legions and collecting money, but with very little action.

3) Because the board is so tight and the game so short, it seems to me that there would not be a great deal of variety in strategies players could employ. This severely limits the replay value.

Very easy to learn and intuitive gameplay.  I don't care much for the theme (something centered on the Mediterranean, yet again?), but the game is still very unique in that it is built for 3 players.  Especially when involving direct combat, it's difficult to find a balanced 3-player game, but I was surprised by how balanced the game is.  There are multiple roads to victory and there can be huge swings in the course of one turn.  Initially it seems like a competence victory is much too simple, but I suppose with experience we can learn how to avoid it.  I think this could easily move up with further play.

Rating based on one 3 player game:
I see how this could be well received.  We need more plays certainly, but it went over "o.k."...
I was able to win, though Political means, and took advantage of Pomp and caeser fighting with each other once too often.
A tad to fiddly with the governor's pieces...but the gameplay is quite good otherwise.  Alot of decisions to be made and the 3 paths to victory is always a huge plus.
Certainly, a few more plays are in order to fully explore the lasting power of this one.

This is quite a good game, but I can see some weaknesses.  One in particular was one player hoarding all the gold and spending the bare minimum each turn, so there was never enough to replenish gold for the other two players on their turns.  Another is the definite potential for kingmaking.

Seems a bit like a 3-player Struggle of Empires with fixed resources and no alliances -- so why bother?  Because it's fun.  A little weirdness for balancing (losing in battle grants the losing player additional competencies), and the history is paper-thin, but it's easy and quick-playing so such things are easily forgivable.

Slightly odd little game. Good to have as a strict 3 player game and i am interested to see how it goes with more plays.

Ended up trading away as the game end seemed to be very similar every time. Everyone blocking until, finally, someone failed to stop the next guy winning. 

Felt far too scripted and lacking in any real decision. Just doing what you had to do for the sake of extending the game. 

It could have still been ok but the limited components meant it limited choices and it always seemed to play out exactly the same.

This is a good game. The problem with it is the player count. It just plays up to three people. Played it with three and had a good time.

Feels like a wallace design.

The limitation of armies, not more than six armies after a turn is a strange extra rule that can easily be forgotten.

The game description explains the gameplay. But not every provence produces each turn. they produce every other turn unless there is a "consul" in it. Not sure about the name of it.

The components are great: thick cardboard, great player aids, one of the best looking maps-on-a-board I've ever seen.  (Regarding the component quality, I had no idea Z-Man was so bad-ass!)

After a couple of plays, is it more fun than 3-player Conquest of the Empire II or Senator?  I don't know yet.

This sort of thing seems to happen a lot:
On Caesar's turn, Pompey is one turn away from winning, so Caesar has to hose him.  Then on Pompey's turn, Crassus is one turn away from winning, so Pompey has to hose him.  Then on Crassus' turn, Caesar is one turn away from winning, so Crassus has to hose him.  Then on Caesar's turn, Pompey is one turn away from winning, so Caesar has to hose him.  Then on Pompey's turn, Crassus is one turn away from winning, so Pompey has to... oh, he can't, so Crassus wins.  Nice work Crassus!

RATING: 7
Though it is a one trick pony in some ways (just try to stop the next player from winning and position yourself so that the one before you can't do the same), there's a charm to this one, and it's fun in its own dry way. The fixed starting positions function as "variable powers" of a sort, the movement rules remind me of Civ somewhat, cool little touches here and there. Just that wee bit of very controllable randomness in the battles, so that it's not entirely deterministic. Short-ish (potential AP warning though!). Thumbs up.

It's actually very asymmetrical in terms of strategy, though the starting positions might not seem that different at first. Might become a bit stalemate prone when all players know what they're doing.

Solid 2-3 player game which when we played we forgot to collect either 2 gold, 2 troops, or 1 gold and 1 troop regardless of where our governors were.  Oops.  Lets just say the money was tight, really tight.  I think it still would be tight even if we remembered to take the regular "allowance" but it would have given us more space to do a few more things.  I went for a forum victory and fell short when I couldn't get enough money or time and lost due to conquest.

Playing this for the first time was a big disappointment.  I really want to like this game given the ancient historical theme and that it was specifically designed for 3 players.  Even so, it missed the mark for me.  It is a little too dry and the balance between the players results in nearly programmed play toward the end of the game.  Deviating from the programmed play will throw the game to one or the other opponent. I'd like to give it another chance and maybe figure out if I am missing something or just don't like the game.

[Played 3 times]
It's simple (for a wargame), but offers several choices. 
The alliances between the players must shift continually to hamper whoever is going to win at the moment. 
Three victory conditions allow (and reward) flexibility. 
A mistake can often be fatal.
Luck is present (when resolving battles) but less important than diplomacy or careful planning.
A doubt: there are so many "compensation factors" in the game that I wonder if different strategies bring to different results OR whatever happens the game boils down to the occasional mistake or strike of luck...

Try to break through the balance.  I'm very impressed with this design.  There are multiple paths to victory (senate, military presence & money/purchasing).  However, your opponents can move you back in either category.  Leaders will be bashed & there will be conflict -- a lot of conflict.  It's difficult to just pick one strategy because if you're weak in a category it's much more difficult to harm your opponents.  Also, there are many equalizing & catch-up mechanisms.  (You may even want to engineer some strategic losses.)  This game boggles my mind.  In fact, my only worry is that it may be too balanced.  Further play is needed.

After several plays, I learned to make this game a lot longer. It wasn't like other wargames I'd played before, so at first I had to be intuitive about my moves. Now I usually want to plan carefully. It can be a bit AP-prone. Often, I want to do three or four things in a turn, but don't have enough movement. I have to consider all the possible routes so that I can do the top two, or maybe bottom three. Also, if one of my objectives is to defend a province, I have options. I can bring armies - but that will affect how many movement points I use across the sea - or I can leave my character there for the extra two defense points - but then my route has to end there.

First of all, despite the smooth mechanics and the quick playing time, this is a gamer's game. There are too many fiddly parts to make this readily accessible for those new to the hobby, and the game doesn't play well unless [i]everyone[/i] is aware of how well everyone else is doing, something new players will tend to ignore in favor of honing in on their own strategy.

But if you've got three gamers who don't mind some conflict, this is a very solid pick. While I find the fiddly parts annoying (moving Governors every round, Compensation, stacking limits, limited supplies, and other exceptions here and there), once everyone knows the game, it's very smooth, even "elegant." The game seems wonderfully balanced, as proven by the diversity of complaints about balance issues among the BGG users. Here are a few quotes:

"Won both games through military victory...worry about balance issues."

"It does seem like a military victory is too tough."

"I think the political victory is much more easy then [sic] the other two."

"Maxing your political and military competence seems to be too easy."

"I have some doubts about the feasibility of a competence victory."

Solves the central problem of 3p Attika [and probably of most 3p gaming in general] by making the blocking impossible unless [i]both[/i] of the potential blockers cooperate. Unless both cave in and "waste a move", both will lose.

Really a rather marvelous game system. It is not a 2-player game; don't believe the box. Rather, it is a very nearly luck-less, heavily multi-faceted game of making yourself [i]just barely[/i] the worse of two targets.

I had really high hopes for this game, as I tend to play most often with 3 players and it sounded so cool from the rules.  Multiple paths to victory is something I generally really like in a game, and the theme was cool to.  I also liked the balance of political, military, and competence.

But the fact is that in practice, the players seem to be put into very specific roles, based upon their starting provinces and player order.  Ceasar seems to just sit and grab people in the forum, Crassus is the military guy because his provinces are less vulnerable, and Pompey is stuck in the middle.  For us, the game quickly devolved into the sort of situation where two players had to try to stop the third from winning.  The first of those two in the order could ignore this and put all the responsibility on the second player, thus preventing him from helping himself at all. Finally, the game seemed to devolve when all the legions ran out, which if Caesar turtles, is destined to happen.  When this occurs, there is no more fighting, and the game isn't really very fun.

The rating of 6 is only my first impression after the first game right on the fair in Essen 2005 and should be taken with the usual grain of salt. In my oppinion the third player in the first round has (had) a severe disadvantage, but that may well be due to my bad playing skills.

RATING: N/A
Great little three player that requires awareness that is not part of human nature.  If played in a balanced way, this game is a sea of shifting tides and fates.  If two gang up on one, then the game doesn't reach its potential.

Reminded me of the three stooges. I hit you with a board, he hits me with a hammer, you slap him in the face, I poke him in the eyes, you do an angry little dance going "whoo whoo whoo".....and round and round we go.

Just a game of musical chairs, and everyone hopes to be in good position when the music stops.

RATING: 8
A tricky area control/resource management game. The multiple victory conditions is what really makes this game go so quickly. It seems very difficult to cover each victory condition. It's probably best to work towards one, but leave yourself able to block the advances of other players. If you try to cover all of the bases you have a hard time.

Second game: Caesar. I decided to go for a political victory. I played my board movements to keep the board as balanced as I could, and tried to end on political spaces whenever possible. I took the first election without any competition. During the second round, since I had two advisors, I tried to keep one on a double legion space and one on a double gold space. This way, I had alot of flexibility during my turns. I managed to keep those two spaces fairly well defended, and could knock out a space on my turn without too much risk if I needed to. I wound up taking the second election, although it would have been possible for my opponent to have blocked me, had he played differently.

Initially enamored with this game, particularly when I was playing a lot of Euros. Since branching into more war and direct conflict games this feels a bit abstract and a little forced. It's still nice for three,  but has lost that spark for me. (9)

Very good "wargame" for three opposed players. Manages to be fairly balanced, but I find it drags slightly. 2 players cannot really gang-up on the third, but a lone player can still feel shut-out of the game. But nonetheless it achieves a working 3-p conflict game that does not rely on gamey rules to maintain balance.

All-in-all, a fascinating game that is pretty easy to learn (the rule book isn't always clear, but the "Rules" section on BGG helps) and filled with challenging choices on each turn. The rules help to promote balanced play, and there appear to be many paths to victory, which indicates good replayability. I see myself playing this often and trying to find two others to join in the fun. The colors and artwork on the game board are beautiful, and all the components are of the highest quality. I also like the typically Euro wooden bits. And, the more I play it, the more impressed I am. Acquired (used) in December, 2008.

Clever game. I was apprehensive at first because it looked a bit like a war game. Thankfully it is a solidly designed Waro- easy to learn and play. 

It's well balanced too. I like the combat mechanics, particularly the compensation, whereby players get rewarded for losing battles, which helps stop any exponential runaway leader issue. It's a tough one to win.

RATING: 7
There's multiple ways of winning the game, which makes this a game of very careful watching, ensuring no player can close the game out over the next round or two, whilst trying to obtain a position where the other players can't stop you going out. The multiple end-game conditions allow for different resource collection strategies and this offers replay. A turn is to: 

a) collect gold and troops where, in a clever twist, provinces only produce every second turn, so you need to plan your collection routes, or gain more civil servants which will allow a province to produce every turn. This cycle makes provinces more or less attractive on alternate turns to your opponents. 

b) do a 4 action point move, which can be to move amongst your provinces gathering up the supplied gold and troops, maybe doing an attack or two, whilst protecting your civil servants. 

c) spend your gold to advance you along power tracks which provide ongoing benefits and potential winning conditions.

It's seemingly well balanced - well, the players ensure there's a balance. The rules are relatively simple but the decision each turn is hard because your movement options are wide and the ongoing ramifications of attacks, both successful and not, can be important and need to be assessed before execution. The game seems continually finely poised, with different players striving for different winning strategies, forcing opponents to make things difficult for them to take those final steps. It just doesn't get requested as often as you'd expect due to the 3 player restriction, the duty of care required to play (you want players with roughly equal experience to correctly adjudge threats) and the war-like theme I suspect.

One of the few games that plays 3 and plays it well. You can travel the whole board in one turn, therefore everyone is fair game. Simple rules that lead to many possibilities. But attacking is costly, so it leads many players to avoid it unless it is a sure thing, which is a little frustrating.

(1 play)  This three player game worked well, but it wasn't nearly as exciting as I expected.  I'll give it another few tries.  It reminds of a few Martin Wallace games.  I keep wanting to try it again, but we end up picking Liberte instead.  I traded it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's a lot to like here (based on one play), but the amount of exposure you leave yourself open to after an attack was disorienting.  I enjoy a lot of the limiting mechanisms, but the game still - despite countless attempts to balance defeats and provide alternative victories - has the three-player war problem.  It seems like an early game of chicken to avoid battle, and the first two to fight can leave themselves weakened the rest of the game if they don't quickly make up (but who wants to make up with guy who just kicked your ass?)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very good 3 player game.  Many games reach a climax point where it becomes pretty obvious who is going to win, but the game may continue for some time longer.  In End of the Triumvirate all 3 players are constantly within each of winning- which means all 3 players are constantly very close to losing.  This results in a lot of tension and a very fun game.

Revised rating from an 8 to a 5 after a couple more plays.  The game sacrifices a good game on the altar of balance.  The mechanics don't make thematic sense (I'm getting slaughtered so I'm becoming more competent and gaining armies).  Traded away.

3p game only. Roman Empire game of politics and military. It is actually pretty simple and lasts about an hour so I can't complain about that. The military resolves from bag draws of players cube colors and the amount of strength they bring in and are defending with. There are multiple ways to win which is nice. All in all I wasn't wowed but am happy to have played once. A game I don't think I need to play again. I am not really an area control fan.

Sofar, I like this game. However, this may change... Sofar, some games have ended either in an early victory due to inexperienced players. The games that did not end in an eary victory ended in a situation in which each player was on the brink of victory, and the last rounds were all about stopping the next player winning the game, making those last rounds rather destructive.

Nice light wargame for three players. There is a good amount of confrontation and the turns are tense but there is no cohesive build. Everything tends to be a reaction to what other players have reacted to. For every step you want to take, there are two that you don't want to but must in order to keep an opponent from sliding into victory. Much better than something like Mare Nostrum but lacking the depth of something like History of the World (not a deep game to begin with). It is fun but very lite - Battle Cry type of lite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A mix of a Euro and wargame, this is one of the best balanced 3 player games I have seen. The strategy is complex, but the play time is actually pretty short. The multiple victory routes keep things interesting. I love the game mechanics, and how you get compensation if you lose a province.

Update: Having played this a few times I see that the 3 player balance means that players keep going around in circles, with 2 players constantly trying to "bash the leader", depending on who he is. Gameplay is a little repetitive, as you gain and lose the same provinces over and over. The main victory strategy I've seen is positioning yourself to win two elections, although canny players can win a military victory if they are sneaky enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After one play we need to try again. The 3 players must try to play a different strategy from the others. We all ended up going for the competencies which gave the first player the game by default. Not sure how a military victory is possible but will have to try it next time. I enjoyed it enough to play a second time but am glad I did not buy it to own.

The sea movement makes for a wide open game which squeezes some of the planning aspect away leaving more at the moment tactical decisions. Otherwise, OK balance with great dependence on one of your opponents also seeing that the other is in a position to win else you lose as well.

A bit more abstract than I expected, but an excellent 3 player game. Seems to play like a knife fight.

Avoids a lot of problems of 3 player games that if 2 fight the 3rd wins. All players have to compete. The various ways to win allows keeps any player from being knocked out. As the game progresses, each player must watch his opponents to make sure each keeps knocked back just enough not to win. Lots of decisions, if you try for one type of win you become vulnerable in other areas. To be flexible is a virtue.

The look of the game is outstanding.

Elegant design. Very tense. Only issue is that legions in this game feel more like fleets than ground forces. Concentration of force is key because geographical position means little due to the huge distances that can be moved easily by sea. [Added after more plays. Concentration has its own dangers: undefended provinces are easy targets for a player pursuing outright military victory. Balance. So well designed!] The type of game that, after a game, you keep turning it over and over in your head to examine what to do better next time.

Having a strong preference for the euro-war hybrid category, triumvirate seemed like a hit from the start. I can say that it wildly surpassed my expectations, and along with Wallenstein, Antike and 1812: The Invasion of Canada, remains one of the best representations of what a good euro-war game can be.

The components are excellent: typical European standards. The art and iconography are brilliant. The mechanics seem fine-tuned and complex. With all the different paths to victory, triumvirate should have quite a few more plays in store to discover all the different paths to victory.

This is an interesting game.  It is one of the few that is a three player game.  I like the game and the mechanics are solid.  My only complaint is that the third player, the combo player is to weak.  The Military player is very strong and the Political player is very strong, but the combo player, half military and half political, is not strong enough to fight either of them in their respective fields.

--Feb2012-- Rather abstract: the whole buildup of political, economic, or military influence isn't the natural metaphor here.  Instead, one tends to move cubes about.

(Rating based on one play.)  I found this game to be moderately fun, and physically beautiful.  I worry, though, about the details of its three-way asymmetry.  Each of the three players has a particular strength, and there are three win-conditions, each playing to one of those strengths.  As such, in the game we played, each player only played to his own strength, and didn't often try to slow down the others much.  I wonder if this game will tend to play out the same way most of the time.  In fairness, it's too early to judge.

這是一款比較少見而的三人遊戲。先來介紹一點相關的歷史背景吧。整個遊戲的機制和遊戲的背景扣合得還算比較緊密，玩家有不錯的代入感。

三頭同盟
指 古代羅馬共和末期前後兩次由三個權勢人物聯合執掌國家最高權力的政治體制，亦稱三頭同盟。西元前1世紀,羅馬社會處於激烈動盪的轉折時期，城邦共和政制已 不適應龐大的羅馬霸國發展的需要。所謂三頭政治即是在帝制尚不成熟的條件下形成的集團獨裁，它是由共和制向帝制過渡的形式。

前三頭政治
公 元前60年，在羅馬擁有巨大勢力和影響的G.J.凱撒、G.龐培、M.L.克拉蘇•迪弗斯三人秘密結盟，通過各種手段左右老兵、流氓無產者、在職官員，共 同控制羅馬政權，史稱“前三頭政治”。按三頭協議，凱撒任西元前59年執政官，任內設法通過分配土地給退役老兵並降低包稅人租金等有利於龐培、克拉蘇以及 他們的支持者的法令,任滿後出任山南高盧總督5年。西元前56年，三頭在盧卡會晤,決定凱撒續任高盧總督5年；龐培、克拉蘇任西元前55年執政官，任滿後 分任西班牙、敘利亞總督各 5年。西元前53年，克拉蘇在侵略帕提亞的戰爭中敗亡（見帕提亞帝國）。龐培與凱撒矛盾激化，雙方於西元前49年開戰,凱撒佔領羅馬。次年龐培兵敗被殺。 前三頭政治以凱撒建立獨裁統治告終。

後三頭政治
凱撒於西元前44年被刺身亡，羅馬內戰再起。西元前43年，凱撒派的G.屋大維 （見奧古斯都）、M.安東尼和M.A.李必達三人公開結盟，由元老院授予共同統治國家 5年的權力，史稱“後三頭政治”。三頭發佈《公敵宣告》，剪除政敵，于西元前42年在巴爾幹半島擊潰以M.J.布魯圖和G.喀西約•龍基納為首的共和派軍 隊。西元前40年，劃分勢力範圍：屋大維轄義大利及高盧和西班牙，安東尼統治東部地區，李必達治理非洲。西元前36年屋大維剝奪李必達兵權。西元前31年 安東尼被屋大維戰敗，次年自殺，後三頭政治告終。屋大維成為羅馬的唯一主宰，建立帝制，羅馬帝國確立。

Good well balanced three player struggle in Ancient Rome. Players have three paths to victory (military, political, competence) and turns are fast with resource generation, movement, battle and political control tossed in.

Fast playing with lots of neat ideas (battle bag). The board can get a little messy and it does end far quicker than I like it too but still good fun nonethless.

Holy Crap, this game is cool.  Lovingly designed for three players.  There was so much thought that went into this to counter imbalances in three player conflict games.  

Outside of the fact that the game is absurdly gorgeous, the play is beautifully elegant in and of itself.  The system is made to make turtling virtually impossible.  Multiple paths to victory, meant that the choices become tougher and tougher as the game progresses.  

The game requires that players remain malleable, as any move in one direction leaves you open and exposed in another.  Lots of flex to the gameplay.  I suspect that this is going to be among my favorites.

I continue to want to play this, over and over.

RATING: 7
Way underrated game.  I consider learning the game system the cost and dynamic play the reward, the better ratio between these two factors the better the game (with interest in the theme sprinkled in).  

(later) Downgraded from 10 to 7, sandbagging is a major component of victory, build up so you don't get jumped and glide to a competency or consul victory.

This may likely move to a 9 with more plays, as it might be the best three-player game I've played.  It's a great area control game, with some depth as you have to balance trying to influence the elections in order to become consul with having enough military prowess to control your provinces.  This game moves quickly and has nice interaction.

RATING: 7
I got this off a prize table in the original German, but I printed up some very nice English aids off the 'Geek. Of course, you don't actually need them -- it's a very straightforward game. First 2 plays:
#1: competence victory (Sarah)
#2: military victory (RickS)
Despite the simple rules, there is a lot of angst about what you should do each turn. Turns should, however, move pretty quickly; the game should play in the 60-90 minute time frame. It also appears that each of the win conditions are viable (although I need to play some more to see if [b]I[/b] can actually pull off a win one of these times!).

The one problem with it is that the players really need to know the game to understand when someone is close to victory. It's a closely fought, tight game that counts on players holding each other in check (very appropriate with the theme!). If they do not do so, it may be easy for one player to run away with the victory. I wonder if this is better as a 2-player game (or with 3 players who know the game well)?

RATING: 5
I really want to like this game and I need to try it again.  Maybe I'm missing something here, but I have some issues with it.  First, it seems designed to be TOO balanced, with the losers in battles being overcompensated and the election winners being harshly penalized.  I played poorly, making several mistakes and was reduced to two territories, then I scored a political victory!  Maybe it's just the Risk player in me talking, but it does seem that most games will go down to the wire artificially.  Also, the board is too small.  It doesn't need to be huge, but here it's a bit too congested. In addition, it does seem that the political victory is a little too easy to achieve and can happen too quickly, although that might change with more experience.  Lastly, I don't care for the way battles are resolved. I prefer a system with a little more chance instead of one where the winner is already known in most cases.  Perhaps that's the Risk side of me talking again!  On the plus side, a three player game with multiple victory conditions, battles, balancing military, economic, and political goals with straightforward rules holds so much promise that I want to play it again and hopefully enjoy it much more upon future playings.

The good news is that this really does play well with three. The bad news, for me at least, is that while it's got a ton of theme layered on, your decisionmaking isn't remotely connected to that of your historical counterpart.

I'm an old warhorse who sees the setup, and gets excited about the fight to the death that seems to be promised. Then it turns into duck duck goose, round and round we go, and I'm ready to head back for the barn.

The design is clever. It's obviously been well tested, provides a tight contest, and works as advertised with three. But it's Euro to the core. Those who revel in thematic immersion should keep on looking.

RATING: 6
There is nothing wrong with this game but I just don't like Weuros that much I guess.  This game is an excellent execution of the Weuro concept with rather simple rules, a cube-based combat system (similar to Wallenstein), and strong compensation for losses in battle to keep everybody in the game and avoid a runaway leader.  I personally don't care for the battle system or how the board is laid out b/c virtually any province can be attacked by any other province at any time.  This, combined with the compensation rules, makes winning by conquring 9 pronvinces virtually impossible.  Of the other 2 paths to victory, maxing your political and military competence seems to be too easy but maybe I'm wrong about that.  Overall this game is rather good, just not the type of game I like.

RATING: 5
Good looking, reasonably fun game that is more about not getting picked on at the right times than anything else.  Mechanics are kind of interesting, but it just doesn't matter what you do if the other players go after you slightly more than each other.  Such are most direct conflict games, I guess, and at least this one isn't too long.

Played 1+ times.  Pretty good game.  Seems very balanced.  I like the asymmetrical starting positions, the 3 ways to win, the constant balancing act between money and legions and winning and loosing.
Unfortunately it's very essence is hold back the player on your left until you can't and someone wins.  This is a characteristic that I don't like in games for more than 2 players.  At three players it is almost forgivable because it is hard to design 3 player games.  But I will probably play but not suggest this in the future. 2009/09/02

Some issues on turn order - going last in a phase seems too powerful.

I enjoyed this.  The combination of the war game coupled with the political intrigue or the Composite win made for an interesting balance, and interesting decisions about what to do on your turn.  

I would like to play this a few more times, but if all the different tracks are balanced, it could make for a very, very good goto game for three players.

Ultimately got rid of this one not because I didn't enjoy it, but simply because for the shelf space, I'd rather keep San Marco on the shelf than this one.

Interesting and - once players absorb the rules - fairly quick. I have some doubt as to whether this will remain engaging through repeated play given its depth limitations, but for now this one is a keeper and I look forward to putting that to the test. Update: This rarely hits the table and, for me, is no longer a keeper (and rating downgraded to 6). This game does a pretty nice job of embracing the inevitability of two players trying to keep the perceived leader in check in a three-player game. I do like its simplicity, and the multiple paths to victory. But I've never been a huge fan of games that involve leader-bashing, and that is at the very core of End of the Triumvirate, which is probably why this has become less interesting to me over time ...

One play: Plenty of tension and certainly a lot of meaningful decisions.

My problem is that the theme doesn't feel well integrated with the mechanics. The game has you pulling a lot of different levers while your opponents are trying to pull back. The levers are all different types and to make the game feel like it's not just a bunch of random lever pulling the theme needs to tie it all together. It doesn't do that well so I am left playing an inelegant abstract that has me just doing a bunch of different stuff hoping I do it better than my opponent.

The game is well balanced and the mechanics will undoubtedly keep the games competitive. But unless I can start to feel more buy-in on the theme I don't know if I can enjoy it.

I found my one play interesting, but this hasn't hit the table in a long time.  I like the mechanics, but was a little annoyed by the fact that it feels as if all you ever do is bash on the player to your left while the player to your right bashes on you.  You never really have much reason to go after the person to your right, because you can leave that for the next player.

I have since traded this away because it was unlikely to get played again.

RATING: 7
Four plays.  Initial feeling is very positive.  It seems to have capabilities of different styles of play, different layers of screwage and interaction.  I really want to get comfortable with recognizing who is close on the victory conditions better, and play with a better table.  Any game where replacing one player will shift the entire game style is my kind of game, and it seems like this is a possibility with this one.  I really want to play this more.  A constant bash the leader game, as the play progresses and the player's closeness to the victory conditions saturate.  Unless of course, someone can pull of a sneaky military victory.  

The strategy is simple.  Do everything, while preventing the other two players from doing anything.  Delicious.

At first the game seems purely tactical.... I doubt it.  Last game I got pigeonholed in and allowed a military victory to an opponent.  Must figure out how and why I got backed in to a corner.... fun.

An older game, if you can call 2005 old, that I'd been wanting to try for a while, but had never gotten around to playing. For no apparent reason, I always mixed this up with Scepter of Zavandor, I suppose because they're both Z-Man releases that came out around the same time. They're both games that I had some desire to try, but no strong desire to buy. Of course in practice they're actually completely and utterly different. I enjoyed the military aspect of End of the Triumvirate, although three-player games with a military aspect trouble me given the fact that they're not zero-sum like two-player games, and the best course of action for Player C when Player A is winning and attacks Player B may be to pile on and also attack B in order to catch up to A. It seems to be an issue with the military aspects of many three-player games, such as Through the Ages, and is why I'm often a fan of two-player gaming even for games that can accommodate more players, but this one is obviously geared towards three-player gaming so I should give it another shot or two before really passing judgment.

I need another play to be certain, but the last time I played I accidentally forced the player into the role of kingmaker.  He had to play a political game to ensure player 3 wouldn't win in the election coming up.  Player 3 was then unable to affect my winning by getting all development(?) tracks to full.

It may have been a fluke.  While this game is interesting it feels like the winner is determined midway through, just not revealed until 'boom - I win'.

RATING: 7.5
Easy and fast to play. Most decisions have side effects, which make me feel that there is a lot of room to develop skill and intuition for this game. For example, the actions you can take after movement depend on what type of region you ended your movement in.

There are basically three victory tracks on which you can win (conquer 9 provinces, win political election twice, max out the competence tracks), but they are tied together in some ways, so it doesn't feel weird like it does in Power Struggle. If you want to view it as a race game, everyone is at least running a similar race.

"Knife fight in a phone booth" seems pretty accurate.

...Occurs to me that you could view the map as a complicated Rondel variant.

...This has a 3-player chess feel for me in the sense that it feels like I can (if I try) see ahead to subsequent players' next moves (and thus responses to my moves). Combat randomness mitigates this a bit; otherwise I think I would find it too unnerving to enjoy.

[Reviewed 2006/03/02, based on 1 play]

Standard wisdom is that three-player games end up with the two players who fight each other most wearing each other down to the point where the third wins by default.  This doesn't, it's a genuine three way struggle, with several equally viable paths to winning.  The map is small enough that there is frequent conflict; the trick seems to be in winning such without leaving yourself hopeless over-exposed somewhere else.  The only niggle is the 'compensation' payments made for losing provinces in battle - in terms of game balance, it's great, but it's glaringly obviously pure mechanic, there's no thematic justification for it all, as far as I can see.

Would definitely play this again given the opportunity.

Played a single game with three (experienced) Euro gamers and was not impressed. The game plays fast enough, requires some real decisions and offers some novel and streamlined mechanics. It is just that the end game was quite a let down, with player A having to spend her turn to keep player B from winning, only so player C could get away with a victory. It felt like my chances of winning relied upon my neighbour slipping up. And up until the end game, the compensation rules kept us all close together on the compentence track, up until the point where it felt it would be impossible to break away. As enjoyable as the first part was, I have never played a game with this much "rubberbanding". Willing to give it one more try though.

Super jeu pour la qualité des composantes et le graphisme. Le jeu ressemble un peu à la facture de Endeavor. C'est une belle mécanique de jeu. Malgré le bel essai de coller une mécanique au thème historique, le thème a du mal a ressortir. Par exemple, c'est irréaliste de perdre tous ses supporteurs au sénat après avoir été élu consul une fois. Ce qui réduit les chances d'être ré-élu consul et gagner comme consul à vie. On est loin de l'histoire où on corrompait les supporteurs pour gaver le vote au sénat, que ceux qui avaient l'or contrôlaient les légions et le pouvoir militaire donnait le pouvoir politique. Dans ce jeu, tout est super bien équilibré. Ça reste donc un jeu qui tourne bien avec un thème plaqué. C'est un jeu d'anticipation, de cycles et de calcul. Il faut savoir où et quand intervenir.

Very good balance and design for three players.  The game is up my alley, with good theme, excellent production values, and just a touch of negotiation.  Seems to be well balanced, both between the three different factions and between the different ways to victory.  This game is very meaty, but has a small and intuitive ruleset and a short playing time.  You'll be at the endgame before you realize it.  One of the best blends of wargame theme and euro mechanics that I've seen.

I have a few small quibbles with the design.  The "We must stop him, or else he wins" endgame has caused some rather game-y shenanigans some of the times I've played.  There can sometimes be a bit of left/right binding problems, though that is mitigated in large degree by the Compensation II card which gives a dramatic boost to anybody who gets attacked twice in a row.  I wish that there was some kind of hidden knowledge, but that's a matter of personal taste.  But these problems are all very minor.  Go play the game, because it's innovative and cohesive.  Definitely worth a try, and probably worth a buy.

Great game that is nicely balanced for 3 players in a conflict for the rule over Rome. This game is a logistical nightmare (in a good way) since you only have a limited number of movements per turn and way too many things to do. Optimal play seems to break down a bit into A attacks C so B attacks A and then C attacks B, rinse, repeat. Catch-up compensation mechanic also doesn't make much sense, but it works.

On the one hand, this game has a lot going for it.  It's a near-perfect information game, with the only randomness coming from the battle bag, and in games of combat, a little randomness is necessary.  In addition, the game seems very well balanced, between the number of actions you get versus the number of actions you want, and in the different ways that you can win the game.  Unfortunately, I'm not always that thrilled with perfect information games.  In addition, the game seems to suffer from the "two guys beat up on one" mentality (though, ideally, this doesn't seem like the best way to play the game), and it seems like it could devolve into a Puerto Rico-style game, where there are optimal moves to take every turn, and once the players reach that point, it comes down to the battle bag.  I'm still willing to play it again, but I'm not sure that I have the high hopes that I had for it before my first play.

A rare game designed exactly for three. Extremely thinky, which I like, but AP-phobes beware. The interactions between the three victory conditions, the military aspects of the game, and the compensations for getting attacked are all really interesting.

Although there are dudes on a map, the game feels much more like an abstract or Euro than a war game. Combat is nearly deterministic, and you'll spend much more time considering the interactions of the various mechanics than traditional military aspects like positioning and lines of defense. Often the best strategies are decidedly unthematic, and also, all the cubes. I don't mind this at all (I love abstracts), but just know what you're getting into.

My one big complaint is that the game has a significant "snake eating its own tail" feel (as described by my gaming buddy Sphere). After the first few turns, everyone is basically in a position to win on their next turn (or at least the one after), and so every round much of your turn will be spent knocking down the player to your left. What begins as a hugely wide open game with tons of possibilities quickly gets heavily constrained by things you simply must do every round to keep the next guy from winning. Thus, playing well consists of figuring out how to do that while still helping yourself, and eventually trying to put yourself in a position that you can't be stopped (seems rare) or that someone makes a mistake (less satisfying, but seems more likely).

Overall though, a really fascinating and interesting game, designed for a player count that doesn't get much love, but which I find myself in regularly. That makes it a winner to me.

Fun game politics and military struggle in Rome. Great three player game. Seems like every play is going to have a King Maker, but I guess that's to be expected in a three player game.

An excellent game designed for 3 players and plays well with that number.  Great theme that acutally applies to the gameplay as well.

This is superb!
It seems that suddenly you make that "one error" too much... and then you can only watch how the other wins.

a great 3 player (and even 2 player) battle of wits war game. With 3 methods of victory, it's a game of balance and pegging back in whatever method your opponent or the leader is leading in. However, I think it's a actually a better 2 player game than a 3 as with 3 players you are relying on the 3rd player to help peg back the leader as it is very difficult to do this solo and leaves yourself open to attack unless temporary alliances are made, which to me, reduces the fun factor. I love the limited resources in the game, with sometimes being a lack of legions, other times a lack of money. How the game teeters on the brink with players an inch away from victory, and someone has to eventually give and take a risk by either attacking big time and leaving holes within his own defense or just trying to cross the line in the competence/political race. All good. I rate the game an 8  with 2 players and a 7 with 3.

Buying a 3-player game is like buying a yacht.  You'll use it once per year if you're lucky.

After 1 play I can see this being a very close game almost every time. Everything seemed balanced. You really have to plan ahead.

Played twice. It is nice to see a game designed especially for 3 players. It has interesting ideas and several winning conditions, which is quite nice. So far I have seen a military and a skill victory, and in both games the political victory was close.

Decent conflict game for 3 players. I liked how the player who lost provinces was compensated so they can't get beat out of the game. The three different ways to win were also fairly balanced. For whatever reason, I feel like it lacked "that special something" to make it really stand out but I'd play it again.

great 3 player area-control/wargame, watch your opponents carefully because a wrong move can give the win away, victory is balanced on a razor's edge

Toda una lección de historia antigua para dos o tres jugadores. Las partidas, cuando se sabe jugar, no suelen ser muy largas, por lo que siempre te quedan ganas de repetir. Parece ser que César tiene algo de ventaja respecto a Craso y Pompeyo, aunque yo no lo he notado en mis partidas.

Whooo.  Tight, constrained game in which every move counts.  Is it too balanced?  Not sure.  I know that I agree with the whole "knife fight in a phone booth" comparison so far.

Really awesome gme kinda like shogun lite with multiple paths to victory. Highly reccommended

Viciously balanced.

UPDATE: A bit too deterministic, coupled with simple mechanics make the game feel "solvable". I would like to experiment with a money supply that fluctuates, as well as increase the chance element of combat just a hair.

Works very good with 2 and with 3 players. Clever mechanism and cool bits. I was surprised to see it flowing so smoothly. After the first reading of the rules i thought otherwise. Nice extra information on the historical background - you have to keep an eye on those designers: very promising!

2-player game was really boring.  Rather than shoot myself, I sold the game.

I've only played this a few times but it seems to end as a close game every time, not sure yet if that is really a good thing or not.

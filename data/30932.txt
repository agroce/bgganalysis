This is certainly a bit of a cross between Geschenkt and Coloretto.  I would say that it's more fun than the latter, but not the former - but then Geschenkt is one of the simplest and most devilish games out there!

There's a fair bit of luck involved and a lot going on - maybe too much for such a short game, but repeat plays will enable me to get a handle on it all, perhaps.

Art work is lovely as are the stones and bits.  It's going to be a nice change to play once in a while.

RATING: 6
Set collecting with an auction system seen before in Mogul and Geschenkt/No Thanks. Lascaux adds second guessing what those dropping out of the auction after you will pick. An OK game that I'd be happy enough to play occasionally.

The theme of collecting cave paintings is one of the more bizarre.  The artwork is quite pleasing, though the animals could have been easier to tell apart.  All the components are nicely done; the stones used for currency are a particularly nice touch.

Good bidding game, but the point system on the end ruins the game. Then it proves that most efforts were worthless, since only a majority in a certain type of animal counts.

We played two games with three players and I think this game is clever and pleasant with nice pieces.  It aspires to be a push your luck stare down kind of game and it works as intended.  True, the game is a bit simple and straightforward, but still, it should be higher rated here on BGG.

Simple to play but probably lasts longer than it should for what's involved. May be made more acceptable to me by dropping one or two of each animal type.
Requires an element of double think. Do you choose the colour you really want and go all in or something that others likely haven't chosen so you can get more stones?

RATING: 7
Neat quick auction set-collection game with several interesting features:

1. Up to seven cards are drawn face-up at the start of each round. Players secretly select what cards they'd like to take if they get the chance, so you're bidding against rivals with hidden objectives. You can however try to deduce their aim from the face-up cards they've already won. 
2. Cards depict cave paintings, which are what you are trying to win, but the cards you take if you get the chance are one step removed from this, because you bid on the coloured hands that are also depicted on the cards. This means that players can in effect be bidding against each other even when competing for different animals.
3. Passing can sometimes be the optimum move, and is a good way to recoup your diminishing store of money if you pass early enough. However, the sooner you pass, the less likely you are to be able to take cards at the end of the round.
4. All-or-nothing scoring - you only get points if you have the most or equal most of any particular animal category. This means you're constantly deciding whether to keep chasing a category or give up and cut your loses.
5. The thematic polished shell currency looks lovely.

On the downside, there's a degree of luck in how the cards come out. If cards you want are up for auction at the same time as cards wanted by a rival player with lots of money, you'll struggle to win the round.
Also, as others have mentioned, the different cave animals look very similar at a distance.

RATING: 6
an intriguing take on blind bidding and set collection.  The components are absolutely gorgeous and the game has the best looking liner (insert) since Andromeda.

Despite the lavish components, the game itself is very dry and straightforward.  The theme doesn't do much to help the game except to make the pain slightly duller.  I would enjoy the game on occasion, but there are far better in the genre.

Simple, fun game.  Very nice production and the bowl in the insert makes it.  Also, a decent game.  Reminds me a bit of No Thanks! with the bidding style.

One of my favourite fillers at the moment - has the Geschenkt/No Thanks! bidding mechanic but you're selecting a suit (colour) to bid on to collect sets of animals. Quite a bit of trying to predict what others will do and pushing people to bid too much - running out of stones (cash) is very very bad! Looks pretty, but until you play a few games the animals look a little too similar and the colours are a little hard to distingush (at least they have icons too, although they're not very obvious).

RATING: 4
This game is almost a dictionary definition of "overwrought". Take the wonderfully simple and engaging No Thanks!, and then layer on a couple extra dimensions that serve mainly to make the game long, confusing, and extremely random - much more random with much less player control than there is in No Thanks!, in my opinion. So, to summarize: more complexity, less control, more chaos, and triple or quadruple the play time ... not a winning combination to my mind. I'm annoyed by the generally positive reviews this fairly vacuous game has gotten. $30 or whatever it was (too much) down the drain ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Lascaux is alright for what it is, but I'm just not a fan of the bluffing genre.  To me, bluffing is just guessing, and I don't like games all that much where you have to guess what other peoples' choices are.  In this game, you have to guess whether other people are going for the same things that you are.  If you think they're going for the same thing, try to outbid them with your stones.  If not, don't, but try and get as many stones as you can before bowing out, which adds another layer of guessing how far your opponent is willing to go before taking the bidding stones for themselves.  Way too much guesswork which makes me feel as if my actions really don't have a heck of a lot of impact on the outcome.

Overall, I'd rather play Geschenkt which gives the same feel in a much quicker and simpler package.

High production value bidding game (art auction?) about real cave art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Similar to No Thanks! but with a little more going on. However, I can't help but feel that in adding things, some of the purity I love so much in No Thanks! is gone.

The gameplay is simple and fun, but it feels a little less cutthroat (although you can definitely screw other people over.) It also takes longer but doesn't really feel like it's fun enough to justify the extra time.

My main complaint here is that most of the time, everyone who isn't in the first or second spots ends up with absolutely nothing, which makes vying for, say, 3rd place feel totally pointless. It's just about seeing how much you can cash out, at that point.

Played twice at Origins.  This is a great filler and an excellent family game.  The theme has nothing to do with the game, but it has very attractive components, and tossing the stones in the cup offers that same rhythmic feel that mancala does.  Quick, tense, and a lot of fun.

RATING: 5
Simple bidding / set collection game. About 45 minutes. Interesting mechanic whereby each player chooses one colour of 'hand' which he may be able to pickup if he does well in the bidding round balanced against dropping out of the bidding earlier in order to gain bidding counters. The art is nice but I'm not sure why we are bidding for it.

Kind of interesting. Clearly going for the "No Thanks on steroids" idea. There's even another dimension of second guessing (choosing colors when passing), in addition to whether players will chip-in or bail out. I'm not sure this other dimension is really necessary. I would be interested in trying again playing colors face-up, just to speed things along. It takes a fair bit of checking and cross checking to figure out what color someone might want. And if you guess wrong, results can be very bad. I don't really have a big problem with that, except that it add significantly to the playtime, at least it felt that way in our couple plays. Ultimately, I felt like in pumping No Thanks up, the charm got a little lost in the mix. Others in our group liked it a lot.

A single game with 3 players at the Spellenspektakel 2007-convention was sufficient to convince me to get this game. I have played on many occasions since, and stick to my initial opinion. This is a simple and fast game of bidding, bluff and reverse psychology; in my opinion better than Filou which came out at the same time. It's not super, but it isn't mediocre either, and gets the blind bidding-aspect just right by not cluttering up the core mechanic with too much information the players can not plan for. The playing rythm is pleasant and smooth, and the results more than once cause for a good humorous laugh. Quintessential starting up, filler, and winding-down material.

RATING: 5
While I quite enjoyed the psychology of choosing colors and when to drop from a round, the lots available for auction vary unpredictably in both quantity and (for a given player) quality. (Slightly reminiscent of advanced O Zoo Le Mio.) Since your bidding power will naturally wax and wane during the game, the timing of when a big/good-for-you lot comes out relative to your bidding ability seems swingy. (Atop the inherent fortune of second-guessing opponents in hidden color choices.)

This game provides an additional layer of depth that is rare among "push your luck" games. Like usual, you only have two main decisions (stay in the bidding or take the stones and run). But, what I love is that one has to weigh a couple of things in order to make that decision (how many stones do players have left, what animals are players desiring, what group of cards are players attempting to take).

[Insert required comparison to No Thanks!]  This has more theme than that other game (which has no theme at all), but I don't like it as much.  Lascaux's bits are great, but the cave paintings are difficult sometimes to tell apart.  And there are so many variables to choosing a color that it often seems like you would do just as well selecting at random.  I enjoy the game, and it is reasonably quick, but I prefer No Thanks!

This game is a total hoot!  It's a little deeper than "no thanks" but features the same mechanic of throwing in a token (stone) or drop out.  There is an interesting psychological aspect, and the set collecting method totally works for me.  One minor downside is that it can be hard to distinguish the different animals - but once you learn them (focus hard on the SHAPES not the colors) it flows a little easier.  Grade: B-

Have to say that I don't like the theme that much, though, or that the animals all look similar and the tokens hard to manage. Also, since there's so much information to process, people can take forever to analyze things to death. Feels a little tedious. Wish it would make the table a little more often.

In my opinion, it's a near perfect 20-30 minute psycho-strategy game.  The end comes too quickly...

The bidding mechanic of Lascaux is pretty clever. Players either pay to stay in, or drop out and take what is currently in the pot. Whoever stays in the longest gets their choice of a colour made before the round started, and this continues down to the first player that dropped out.

Unfortunately, the results of the auctions are very random. Unless you come first there is always the chance that somebody before you chose the same colour and you leave empty-handed even though you're second, and the last player still gets a card. Towards the end of the game you can actually make reasonable guesses as to what cards other players would like to have and choose accordingly but before that everything is up to chance.

There is a feeling that this is the offspring of Coloretto and No Thanks! but it truly is it's own being.   For now a seven, could easily rise.

One of the few bidding games that are plain dull. I mean I was so bored playing it it's almost unbelievable. Put a card, choose your token, place a stone and - hoooray - you won! In this moment you wake up.

It is a little like No Thanks, but with a little more to do.  You are trying to collect the majority of particular animals, and rather than spend money to avoid a card, you are spending money to stay in and collect cards.  Just like No Thanks, timing and bluff are everything.  The rocks are a really nice touch for this nicely produced game.  It can go on a little long potentially.

This is a simple set collecting game with mechanics similar to No thanks!. As a game it doesn’t feel fulfilling, but as a filler game I don’t mind that much. The components are gorgeous, especially the nacre shells, but the cards can be a little hard to distinguish at a glance.

It's an interesting drafting game, but the bidding has the potential to severely penalize a player. Also, the rules left questions about the the stack of acquired cards (like can you look at them?).

Not a bad game, but I'd rather just play Geshenkt.

First, some love for the components.  You play with ACTUAL SHELL pieces that are different from each other, and use the insert to store them during the game.  Beautiful and clever (the cards and tiles are quite nice as well).  The game itself is a blind bidding/set collection game that reminded me of No Thanks! in that you can bid, or give up and get currency.  What you are bidding for, however, is turn order, and it's rather difficult to determine where you'd like to be in the turn order.  (1 play)

1st played February 16th, 2014. Card game where you get points for the most of a particular animal.  You lay cards out for a round of bidding and use rocks to get the cards.  If you exit the bidding you take the gems already bid on for biddling later.  Last in takes the cards.  If you don't have any gems you have to take the gems present.

After my fifth play, this goes up from 8 to 8.5. It's hard to say it's a 9 (want to play it all the time), but there's rarely a time I can think of that I wouldn't enjoy this game. 

Much more than a sum of it's mechanics, this game shines as a bidding, guessing, push your luck gem. 

UPDATE
A sixth play, and this is clearly a nine. I can't imagine playing this and not having a good time. This game doesn't seem to fit into my tastes, but it's just fantastic.

Lascaux is a really fun and unique auction game.  I like the way the market works in that not winning an auction does not necessarily mean not receiving any cards.  However, getting into situations where you're after someone else who plays the same color token as you burns and destroys you a little bit each time.  That being said, there's a lot of good game here for the simplicity of just being about the auction mechanic.

This is an auction game of bidding on cards with animals and colors. The goal is to collect the most of an animal. You select one of your tokens with the color present on the cards that you would like. Card selection is based on reverse order of going out in the bidding. I found the animals difficult to distinguish, so it was not easy to quickly see what other players have. There was some fun, but it was not my favorite bidding game. I like For Sale and No Thanks better.

I love games that reward reading your opponents, and Lascaux does that very well. Takes No Thanks! and gives it that needed little extra to be a great filler rather than just an amusing trifle. Play with money closed.

Light fun game of set collection. Instead of playing this game with 5 players each player could as well roll a dice and highest roller wins. But putting on a pokerface and throwing your stones into the pit is just more fun while giving you the illusion of having earned the win.

Lascaux really takes the cake for the thinnest theme ever.  Not really caring about prehistoric art (and especially because the animals are difficult to tell apart when viewed sideways and upside down), the artwork is distracting and hinders my enjoyment of the game.  Also, it feels a little too long for what it is.  Since it shares such a similar mechanism with No Thanks!, it feels overlong when compared to No Thanks!'s "just right" play time.  But the mechanism of dropping out and hoping to score a particular color card feels new, and is kind of fun.  The doublethink involved can be exciting or frustrating, depending on how it turns out for you.  Sometimes people aren't as greedy as you think they're going to be!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Meh, I'd rather play No Thanks. The person explaining the rules stated this was kind of a gamer's version of No Thanks but I'd much rather play No Thanks. Didn't much care for the all or nothing scoring of the cards won. Didn't mind the bidding mechanic most times but I didn't like the color distribution on the cards quite frequently. Perhaps its just not that good with three either, who knows? Either way, I'll never play this one again.

08/17/10 Played a four-player game. 
I thought Lascaux a pleasant filler. However several of the animals look too similar, making them sometimes hard to distinguish when upside down or sideways to you. All six being the same shade of brown doesn't help either. And there's a little more luck and guessing in it than I prefer. I have no idea how that theme figured into what we were doing as players. Were we paleontologists? Spelunkers? Cro-magnons? I have no idea.

The flavor is a bit weird for this game, but that aside, it's a very enjoyable bidding/auction game with light press-your-luck and bluffing elements.

To further the "bit weird" thing is the currency, which looks like the game maker got a killer bargain on mother-of-pearl beads or something.

Definitely a solid game for its genre and the little quirks with it may actually increase your appreciation of it.

Lascaux reminds me of a TV advertisement from years ago about banking advice showing a bunch of cavemen trading their teeth as currency. It was a funny ad, but rather grotesque. The most attractive component in Lascaux is polished rocks that have an abalone lustre the game uses as currency. While I think it would be funny if Lascaux had used teeth instead, it would have been horrific.

Lascaux is basically No Thanks! with a set collection aspect. This slightly increases the rules complexity, but vastly increases the strategy required to win.

I thought NT! was boring in its simplicity. While I do think Lascaux improves upon NT!'s game play, I suck at auction games and this one just didn't do it for me.

This set collection game had a bidding system that was very similar to No Thanks!.  The winner of the bid got their choice of color of animal (which each have 2 colors).  The second-to-last player to drop out would get the next choice of color, if any of their color was left, and so on.  Neat idea, but it seemed a little chaotic for me.

RATING: 5
As with most Euros, I like the play of Geschenkt but dislike the resolution of a winner with unweildy maths, which turns the fun into a chore. After reading various favourable reviews of Lascaux being similar in play and noting the resolution of the scoring seemed better, I played Lascaux 3 times with some variance and each outing was a disappointment.

I think the problem lies strongly with me not picking up the subtleties. 

The joy of Geshenkt is not only the speed of play (first to pass also starts the next round) but each round is focused on only one card. Also because cards picked up are on show, everyone can relate to each others need except for the uncertainty of hidden cash.

Lascaux played as per rules is the exact opposite: there can be 3 to 7 cards with each player secretly deciding which cards to go for (the overlapping due to the colour selected is interesting, but diminishes the focus); purchases are secret so making it difficult to recall and hence relate to what animal types a player is aiming a majority in; lastly, money is open so in bidding there is no tense uncertainty as to how much someone is holding or how much to push before pulling out. 

So the first play with 3 fell flat, and for the next game immediately added the hidden stones variant. This was an improvement, there is fun of frustration when players come away empty handed and the last placed picking up, but I couldn't "see" the bluffing mentioned in the reviews, as purchases are piled so how do you follow what players are going for? I was hoping in the next game that purchases placed in piles would make the bluffing come to the fore, but instead there was cross referencing headaches as to which players would go for which animal group. You could pretend to not care for the cards on offer and milk for extra money, but because the manifest of the deck is too detailed and imbalanced, it is difficult to anticipate what the batches will be like and to time your purchases.

So after 3 plays I couldn't be bothered with the design anymore, despite afterwards considering maybe if players from the outset focus on only 2 or 3 animal types to score well there will be more clarity in thought and players being on the same wavelength. During the games I was reminded of another similar design which I believe had more scope for bluffing and tense resolution, but unfortunately, not many share my enthusiasm for Katzenjammer Blues.

A clever and beautiful gambling game for 3-5 players that (with a few house rules) won't leave you feeling like the victim of lady luck.  
Every decision you make is a calculation on what you believe the other players at the table will do, and victory or poverty will be dealt to you not by shuffled fate, but by the accuracy of your predictions.

That said, it's a shame that the box is so large for what is ultimately a small set collection card game, but the quality of the polished abalone pieces you get to play with more than makes up for it.

A fun but sometimes infuriating bidding game, very much a cross between For Sale and No Thanks!  The animals are a little difficult to tell apart but all the rest of the components are of good quality. Requires more thinking than No Thanks but about the same as For Sale. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A first play, it seems like a smarter No Thanks. There's a little bit more risk, a little bit more to think about. You need to double guess your opponents AND think about the tokens (cute litte stones) you're throwing in to the pot when you pass. Good little game, looks great and great fun - when you win and things go your way. Can be frustrating getting double guessed, especially when you've gambled big.

It's fast and full of hard trade-offs, so I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt on other issues.

A quite nice bidding and set collecting game. Very pretty art and stones, and a clever auction mechanism. It sometimes suffers from the randomness of simultaneous secret decisions, but is short enough and clever enough that I don't mind.

One of my favorite fillers. It has great potential as a gateway game. A simple, yet novel approach to bidding. Heavy on second guessing and preempting your opponents. A truly under appreciated gem in my opinion. A much smaller box could have easily been used, and the iconography on the cards are a little murky. Other than that, I can't find any major flaws with Lascaux. In my experience, this has hooked many a non gamer. Part of my 1-2 gateway game punch. Ivanhoe then Lascaux. They take up a small amount of table space, easy to carry around, and quick to explain. I couldn't ask for much more in a gateway/filler.

--Jan2011-- Weak cousin of [color=blue]Geschenkt[/color].  While the presentation is lovely, the game isn't quite there to match.  Definitely not one I'd pick up.

I really enjoyed this.  No Thanks with set collection.  I liked the clever bidding for / by color.  Overall I like the options this game will give me in my collection.  While I have more pure bidding games like No Thanks, my family and non-gamer friends will enjoy this one much more than the more numeric games.  Plus I like the look and feel of this one.  I'll probably add a cheap wooden bowl to use as a repositry for the bids...  There is one in the box, but I can't imagine they meant it to be functional.  The price of this one is also unfortunate...  while I like it, I'm not sure if I'm willing to pay $30 for a cardgame, with funky rocks.

Push your luck and set collection with an interesting "bid on one thing (colors) to collect something else (animals)" mechanic. Described by those in our group as a cross between Coloretto and No Thanks! Great production values, though the animals can be difficult to identify.

RATING: 5
Good, quick and advanced version of Geschenkt. Just like No Thanks! it seems there's a fair bit of luck in it. Unlike No Thanks! you can't decide to play with the whole deck to play a perfect information game. So, it's really just an over produced version of that game.

A more "colorful" version of No Thanks! that essentially jumps the shark.  One too many scoring twists makes it a very random game.  The components are nice though.  I would suggest playing around with the rules and altering them a bit as the game doesn't feel properly play-tested for the final scoring...

It's No Thanks!/Geschenkt with set collecting.  It has a clever biding/color selection system.  It certainly works well, and there are great ways to mess with other players, but it may be a little too long for what it is, and it was strangely  difficult, albeit a minor difficulty, to know when to stop laying cards out (it is silly I know).  Still, those that are gut players will probably do well with this.

I like to think that you are stealing national landmarks from UNESCO.

A very light, but excellent "gateway" game. Got my significant other to play it AFTER she mumbled the word "tired," which is absolutely amazing. Mechanics are simple. Teachable in five minutes, playable in less than half an hour. As noted in Tom Vassel's review, the animals on the cards are very similar in appearance, which makes their identification towards game's end (when you really start trying to figure out what you need to get you 'over the top', victory-wise) difficult. Kind of a persnickety complaint. All in all, a really nice addition to one's game library, in its Light Medium aisle.

RATING: 6
Intriguing set collection game where you have to decide when to spend most of your chips and when to hold back and save some for the future.  The most unique, clever mechanic is when you "fold" you place a chip with a chosen color, then as others fold they stack their chips on top of yours in order.  In doing so, you still have a shot to win a card if your chosen color still remains when your chip is revealed AND there are unclaimed card(s) of that color.  I would rate it higher except the cards are far too difficult to distinguish, which is pretty critical in a game where you're trying to collect more in each set than your opponent!  The artwork is nice, but they need more distinction.

RATING: 6.5
Artwork is purty, and the real stones are a treat to play with. Animals on the cards aren't hugely differentiated, so can become a bit of a bore in the closing stages when everybody is trying to work out what the hell people have in front of them so they know which animals to go after. Overall a pretty good combo of push-your-luck and auction mechanics. Beware of playing against mathematicians.

This is clearly an improvement over 'No Thanks!'  How it ranks lower than No Thx!, given its superior material components and improved auction, baffles me.  The game is okay with three.  Very good with four, but really blasts off with five.  How many games can you say play best with five in under an hour?

Pros: Fun theme
Nice components
Fast
Bidding similar to No Thanks!
Easy to learn

Cons: Too difficult to differentiate the animals
Bidding chips are nice but clunky
Hard to tell who is ahead

Conclusion: Lascaux is an entertaining game in the same light as No Thanks! and Coloretto.  The theme about bidding for cave paintings works well.  I only wish it was a little easier to differentiate the animals.  Instead of cards with animals of all the same color, it would have been better if they were different colors or even different shades of brown/tan.  Overall, I enjoy playing this game.

A further development of the bid 1, or take the pot and drop out style auction from Mogul and more recently No Thanks! An interesting game in that it adds set collection and a gradiated auction 'win' to the mix. 

Enjoyed it quite a lot, I'll bring it out again.

I feel in love with this game because of the stones.  It's a great game, don't get me wrong.  I probably would have loved it anyway.  It's a great push your luck game that adds a little bit more strategy to the mix (set collection).  But it was the gorgeous stones that really sold me on this.

I love the difficulty of wrapping your head around whether you should plan to stay in for the long haul or can drop out early, the decision of what color you should pick based on that, and they way that the cards you already hold change the value of the pot for all the players.

No Thanks! in steroids. That's how I would describe it. The different animals could have been made a little more different looking. They make your eyes tired after a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This is an auction game, majorities game, and bluffing/outguessing game. You are bidding for cards featuring animals that you want to collect sets of, but you secretly choose which cards (based on a color designation) you're competing for. First the winner and then the other finalists in the auction take what they were bidding for, if any of that color are left.

It is thus like Mogul in allowing the second-place (or worse) bidder to get something. It also uses Mogul's "add a dollar or drop out and take the money bid so far" mechanic which is sort of elegant but gimmicky and not really that great, especially with more players.

The outguessing component, of not knowing what other players are bidding for, makes the game hard to solo. You can't simply make the selections open (even if a turn order were imposed on them) because this can sometimes give players certainty that they will get what they want even if they bid nothing. So a rules tweak (for solo play) would probably involve adding an inherent penalty to placing below first in the auction. Though it might be workable to say that you don't have to pick what you're going for until it's actually time to.

The bidding tokens are very nice pearlescent stones. The different animal cave drawings on the cards are all brown and samey though, which is fairly awful for gameplay.

...On paper this is an interesting melange of mechanisms. But I don't want to play it, due to those same mechanisms. Not the smartest buy on my part.

nope.  tried this again after a LOOONG dusty period.  short version:  JUST PLAY NO THANKS! 

longer version:  too much chaos with each card having "two colours" on it.  too little ability to plan.  also, despite the gorgeous art, its tough to tell different animals apart across the table.  

given away.

RATING: 7
Lascaux is a simple card game that uses a familiar bidding system (especially to No Thanks! fans) to motor a game that plays quickly and is simply enjoyable for up to five players.  Using a unique auction system, players attempt to win cards with pictures of different animals to score the most points.  I have to say I was impressed with how enjoyable the game played - how fun it was to bid, outguess the opponents, and collect cards.

The premise of "who will chicken out first" in Lascaux which is akin to No Thanks! should instantly elevate expectations for this game. Yet, Lascaux takes the core mechanic in No Thanks!, adds some chrome to scoring, tries to upgrade the components and still in the end, fails to improve on the basic game play enough to differentiate itself from its simpler yet more elegant older sibling. 
A note about the components and design from Mayfair: I am not sure if Mayfair actually tested out the design with consumers but the colors of the handprints and drawings are gorgeous but utterly confusing and not practical for gaming. On multiple occasions, players selected the wrong cards because they were confused with the similar shades of these muted, somewhat pastel colors. Worse still, All the cave drawings have identical colors and the shapes are similar enough that they are tough to differentiate after a quick glance. This makes for an exhausting game for what should a simple and light filler. Really terrible design choices.

This game is a perfect example of how, at least in some cases, the ratings on BGG are totally whacked.  

As of this writing No Thanks! is ranked at around 250.  This game as of this writing is ranked at around 1500.  Lascaux is No Thanks! with more tactics, more decisions and far better bits. If No Thanks! is at 250 then Lascaux should be at 200 or 225.  

There are hidden gems. Lascaux is one of them.

An attractive reverse-auction game (a la 'No Thanks!') with several improvements and a drawback. Pros: the components are excellent, and it even includes polished shell bits to use as the currency! The scoring is very straightforward and functional. Con: you choose which color of card you would like to draft from the selection before you even start bidding, meaning that if you are second to draft and the player before you picked that color as well, you get nothing. At all.
I like to play with a slight variant: after all the cards that make up the selection are face-up on the table, also add 1 face-down card. At the end of the round, the first player to go away empty-handed takes the face-down card, reveals it, and adds it to his/her play area.

This is a hard one. The game design is solid. The tableau building is fun. I enjoyed putting together my farm. However, there is just zero player interaction, and I say this as someone who mostly plays euros. In fact, I think this game would be best if it was just designed as a solo game, as that's basically what it is. The only form of interaction is card drafting, but the farms are so large & complex  and the cards are so hard to read from a distance that you would be hard-pressed to figure out what your opponent needs in order to deprive them of it. As a result, we all just ended up drafting the best cards for us and the best player ended up winning. That's it. I love my friends too much to waste my time with them playing a game that I could just as successfully play alone. If an app for this game ever comes out, I'll play it.

For me, a real improvement on [b]Among the Stars[/b].  Good iconography, and a real focus on the puzzle engine-building you want, right from the beginning.  Very much a table-hog, and unfortunately, a grossly oversized box.  Still, recommended!

Fun enough as a solitaire game. Doesn't play any different as a multiplayer though, it's still just solitaire.

Might be fun to try playing it as a cooperative team vs. team exercise.

I also feel like, after a few plays, that the game needs more variety. The basic loop of money->plants->animals->money is a little too straightforward and the game becomes an optimization problem rather than (as I'd been hoping) an engineering problem. An engine building game where you already have the engine supplied to you and all you're doing is mildly tinkering with it isn't quite as thrilling for me, personally, as being able to decide what sort of engine to build and how all the bits should go together to make it actually work.

Score na één keer spelen, en dan nog met de foute regels (distantie 2 bekeken we als een rechte lijn).
Ik speelde het graag, maar je bent echt alleen met de eigen farm bezig, en kijkt totaal niet naar de farm van de andere... Dus eerder solitair.  Geen downtime echter, want je speelt in feite simultaan.

Received from kickstarter pledge. The outside box is nice. Which is a good thing because the rest was horrid. Card packs were opened and cards strewn about. Punchboards had punched themselves with loose pieces I had to sift through the cards to find. The punchboards that didnt auto-punch tore, and are already peeling. Many of the chits are unuseable. The insert was torn. I've backed a lot of projects and this game was by far the biggest disappointment.

update: Received replacement parts, also damaged. Punchboard arrived already punched and warped. Same lack of quality from previous. Chits are torn and the thin paper covering ripped. The punchboard is so weak just merely picking up the board  results in pieces dropping. Coins are still printed off-center. Pieces are falling apart from normal handling. Unplayable. Card backs are different shades. Some have a yellow tint, others have a brown tint.

Fields of Green is a drafting "tile" placement game that also features resource management. This compares to games like Between Two Cities mixed except each tile placed requires payment and grants either a single time benefit or a ongoing effect, or even an end game score. I really enjoyed this game as a change of pace to similar games as each time I play this I could see it being a different game every time. With most drafting games it's important to see what types of cards your neighbors want and ensure that they don't always get it but that the card you choose fits within your requirements as well. This is a fun game with few components that we will be bringing to the table again soon!

Tile laying engine building game with some added resource logistics. A lot of mechanics are reminiscent of city building games like Suburbia or Capital but the farming theme of watering fields and storing grain add some extra considerations. The drafting of cards keeps the game from being completely multiplayer solitaire.

It's an okay game, but for the type of challenge it provides, it takes too long. If somehow the playing time would come down I'd rate it higher.

Also, pretty pricey for a souped up card game.

RATING: 5.5
Proportionate to the component quantity the required gaming-space can be surprisingly big. A 2-player game requires two 5x5 card squares of space, AT LEAST. A serious drawback in terms of space-accessibility. 

Small amount of offensive capabilities and in many ways a semi-solitaire game. The auction-house variant seem to fix this problem at the cost of substantially increasing the playing time, probably making it a ~1.5 hours game which really stretches the scope of the game's depth. I might just rather play 2 whole games of 7-wonders in that time.

2-player is the most competitive variant since there's a much more obvious sense of denying and discarding powerful cards; 1st player turn-priority is essential to get the best cards via the auction:esque layout in the action-phase.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice card-drafting game with a ressources management and engine-building aspect to it, based on Among the Stars (a game that always interested me) but with a bit more depth, and set in an really accessible theme, mid 20th century farming, that is well implemented into the gameplay and cards.
++ There are really a lot of strategies explore in this game as there is a lot of possibilities and combinaisons to score points and the game seem really well balanced and tight in this regards, the winner often winning by just a few points.
++ I really like the twist that you choose your starting hand every round by drawing from 4 different card stacks and not just draw a random hand each round (year) which really help to feed your engine-building and your chosen strategy.
++ I like that cards are laid to form a tableau of your farm (like a tile-laying game), and your also have to manage the spacial element to respect some criteria (distance from water tower to irrigate your fields, proximity  from other type of cards to combo with them, distance away from other cards to get bonus, etc.) which for the most part feel thematic.
++ Minimal setup time: just shuffle the 4 draw piles, give each player their starting farm cards (1 silo and 1 water tower), give players their starting ressources and you are set!
++ The Kickstarter Promo Pack brings "more of the same" with the new location cards and the new equipment tiles, which add variety to the games.
++ The Kickstarter Promo Pack also brings new mechanism to the game, namely the Events cards and the Early Planning cards: The Event are really interesting and bring some thematic unexpected events into the game (something beneficial, something detrimental). The Early Planning Cards, I haven't played with these yet.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- [i](Specific to the Kickstarter edition, and it may not apply to further retail edition)[/i] The cardboard insert was teared up on arrival since it was made of cheap cardboard and that the box content was able to move around during the transport.
-- [i](Specific to the Kickstarter edition, and it may not apply to further retail edition)[/i] The punch boards are of the poorest quality I have ever seen yet: cardboard layers were splitting, the punch holes were not sharp and thus during the punch out, several tokens were damage, even if I was really careful during the process.
-- This game takes so much table space because each player build their own farm using the 70mm x 70mm cards, but you also need place for the 4 draw stacks, the silo and water tower stacks and the different tokens (beyond 3, maybe 4 players by stretching it, a normal kitchen table may be not enough!).
-- There is a lot of text to read on the cards, so the first few games are longer to play when players need to familiarized themselves with the cards abilities (This also apply if it's been a long time not playing the game). I wonder if iconography could have been better than text for this game.
-- I like that the publisher add in a score sheet booklet since the points are coming from a lot of different aspect of the game, but it should have on it the number of items required per point(like 1 point for every 2 foods, and 1 point for every 3 dollars, etc.). I hate to have to refer back to the rule book needlessly just because of this simple omission.
-- The little water tokens are fiddly to move around during the Harvest Phase because of their asymmetric shape (They should have been symmetric and slightly concave on both side). The wheat tokens, even though small, are ok on this matter.
-- Some food tokens (maybe some water tokens too, I'm not sure) have wildly different height which is unfortunate (and this again, clearly show the lack of quality control this game's production suffered).
-- This is less true for 2-players games, which is the best player count IMO, but it's hard to closely monitor exactly what your opponents are doing since their farm spread out a lot, and its hard to see exactly what they have built, especially if you are not familiar enough with the cards in the game (so it's may feel mostly multiplayer solitaire for some as there will be less "hate drafting", but this doesn't bother me much).
-- One of my wife complain is that we need to always count our water usage, our food production and our food usage while playing, thus often interrupting us from the smooth gameplay. This could have been easily corrected by offering the players a "production card" where we would have been tracking these informations with wooden tokens.
-- My wife doesn't like this game a lot so we dont' play has often as I would like.

Surprised by how good this was. Farming and Eurogames aren't my bag, but this card drafting engine building design is pretty damn solid. Lots of interesting strategic decisions yet overall a simple set of rules. Feels very rewarding building your farm and watching it hum along on its own accord.

While I don't really get much enjoyment from this particular theme, the setting is actually more well integrated here than in Among the Stars surprisingly. This is overall a better game than AtS.

We backed this on Kickstarter and were really excited to finally receive it. We got our first round in this past weekend. The rules were succinct and easy to follow. We had no trouble understanding them. We followed the two player rules, which were only very slightly different than the normal rules. After completing the two-player game, we look forward to playing with more people to experience the alternating card-passing. 

We found that once we started playing, the game moved along pretty well. The mechanics are easy to pick up and the flow of the game is logical. We love the detailed farm art, though it might be a bit small. The components are well made. I really liked the cardboard card stack labels! Brilliant! Makes the game less messy when set up, and easier to find what you are looking for. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed playing and really look forward to playing again in the near future. 

For a 2-player game, the rotating card drafting made the game interesting. We followed the suggestion card for what combination of cards to pick each year and look forward to choosing our own card combinations next time we play. The equipment pieces are a nice addition to the game and can really change things up. We especially liked that the game never seemed too weighted towards one player. It is a deep game without being overly complex, easy to pickup and understand. In terms of farming games, it is lighter and takes much less time to set up and play than Agricola or Caverna, which means it will likely get played more frequently at our house.

I’m not sure I understood why the water towers generally got used up without much ability to refill them. It also didn’t make sense that you got extra points for using up all the water. A few things like this didn’t seem to line up with the ideals of real farming. Other things did line up quite well, such as extra points for more space around the cattle. Probably getting picky here, but I like to be able to agree with the premise and principles being taught by games (whether intentional or not). Games are a form of teaching, and if I believe a game is teaching something I disagree with, it will not stay in my collection. That said, I agree with enough of this game to keep it around.

We are hoping for future expansions! There is a lot of room to build on the premise of this game.

Did you love Among the Stars?  Then you'll mildly like this!

Building a farm is more accessible than building a spaceship, but everything else feels like a step backwards.  The gameplay is fiddlier (two resources to manage instead of one), the artwork is worse (muddy and repetitive), and other additions, like equipment, don't seem add much at all.  It also feels as though there's less variety of cards than there were in Among the Stars, but I haven't played that one in a while.

Whilst complex Euros are my thing, I am not a fan of ones with high accounting/upkeep overheads.  This game relies on a lot of that sort of thing.  It is what put me off [thing=123260][/thing].  You have to calculate how much each tile produces based on the combos you have made with surrounding tiles.  It is a spatial optimisation solitaire puzzle.
If you like that sort of game, and I know many who do, then this could work for you. I sold it on as the effort involved to play it was too much and for little reward.

Interesting game, but the quality of the cards that came in my box were dinged up on the edges from the 3 celephane card packs loosely shifting around the box, or possibly mishandled during packaging.  Stronghold wanted pictures of all the cards to replace, so I hust returned for a refund.  I'll wait for it to go on clearance, if I repurchase a game from Stronghold at all.

TRADED IT! (For Zhan Guo)

Interesting take on the farming genre (without dwarves or taking place 500 years ago). Moves quick enough and is of course, largely, a solitary experience. I enjoy puzzley games, so no worries on that front, but the decisions in the game felt fairly automated. You are often just playing the obviou card each round and the game boils down to just doing your best to match cards that go well together.

The choice in which cards you draw each era is a nice twist, but in execution you won't see your hand again until it is picked over, so I'm not sure this addition amounts to much.

It is a fine game, and the theme worked better for me than Among the Stars, but after a few plays, I didn't feel the need to keep it.

Played once. The theme works better than with the similar Among The Stars, I think -- and I generally prefer Science Fiction. Need to play this a bit more, but it was heavier than I expected, which is not bad. Fun to build out your farm and there's lots to consider on every turn.

Terrific drafting game in the mould of 7 Wonders, and the successor to Among the Stars, but with a farming instead of space theme.  Very good for 2-4 players.

Also own expansion cards: [gameid=222141]

The bottom line: "Fields of Green is a welcome follow-up to Among the Stars. It takes what was good about its predecessor, and by re-skinning the original game with a new theme about modern farming that is tied even more closely and sensibly to the game mechanics, it enhances the game by making it even easier to learn and giving it a completely fresh feel. The elements of drafting and engine building come together very solidly, and offer interesting decisions, while not requiring a big investment of time in learning complex rules. The result is a very pleasant game that is challenging, and yet not confrontational, and the fact that it works so well as a two player game is especially a boon to many."

Really liked this one after 1st play. I didn't worry too much about which cards I gave to my neighbor, but I guess that will be an important part of the game after a few plays. I was surprised how fast you get a grasp of all the different cards.
I really liked the puzzle and all the dilemmas involved in where to place the cards (for points, for waters, etc.). Quick filler with simultaneous play.

2016-11-30: Very 'Among-the-stars'y .
I like the streamline of everything ACTUALLY happening at the same time. (the most stupid rule in ATS). Dividing the cards you draft in piles is a good idea, but I felt there wasn't as many different cards as in ATS. It also actually seems to have a bit smaller footprint than ATS which is a good thing.

The theme is well built into the game also.
Unfortunately it can go wildly swinging if someone gets a bunch of the same cards it seems. There seem to be missing a few 'max X of this card in your farm'.
The game is decent but it doesn't grip me really. I might actually like ATS better with its many options from expansions and such now. . but it is a hassle to set up.

Initial rating: 6 (closer to 7 than 5 though. I just don't feel the longing to play this again)

Nice to have a 'modern' farming game.

I enjoyed building the farm and making those decisions about fields vs livestock.  The draft worked well, equipment was very situational, but was nice.

I really appreciated that there were so much variety among the buildings and equipment.  Very few duplicates.

Would definitely play with the early planning and event cards from now on.

I never played Among the Stars. I like that in FoG the physical location of cards matters, this is a cool mechanic. However, after a couple of 2-player games the game does not excite me anymore. There is very little player interaction and the drafting pales in comparison with 7 Wonders. I only played with two players - the drafting may be more fun with more players.
Finally played it with 3 players and the drafting works much better.

Vous êtes agriculteur et vous contruisez votre ferme. Il faut des champs, il faut les arroser. Ils produisent de la bouffe, que vous pouvez vendre ou donner à vos animaux, qui rapportent de la thune, qui permettent d'acheter plus de matos/champs/bâtiments. Tout ça ce sont des cartes, qui construisent peu à peu une mosaïque dans votre coin et interagissent entre elles. Ca se joue assez rapidement (4 rondes) et les cartes sont choisies pour former des paquets puis distribuées en "draft", ce qui permet de stratégiser. Mention spéciale à la carte promo d'Essen, "Crop Circle". Un jeu à l'allemande mais simple, joli, avec du thème. J'ai aimé.

RATING: 3
The game is basically a more complicated version of "Among the Stars" with a dull farming theme and ugly artwork. There is an extra resource, an extra phase, equipment and card subtypes. Everything just causes a mental overload without any return in fun.

Cards are now separated by type, and you can choose how many to draw of each, but what is the point if you are going to draft them anyway? I suppose this is intended to address the problem of the cards being the same in all rounds (unlike in "7 Wonders"), but it doesn't really solve it. Also, the new harvest phase, at the end of each round, just prolongs an already boring game, with tedious, repetitive and unimaginative effects. In my only play, with one round to go, I just wanted the game to end.

And did I mention that the artwork is ugly? "Among the Stars" was marvelously illustrated, but this is just drab and uninspired.

Core Mechanics are Similar to Among the Stars, but it changes the drafting mechanism and introduces the problem of continuously supporting build structures.

Simple, quick engine-building game that successfully blends card drafting with a fun tableau building / spatial element. It's multi-player solitaire, so don't expect much interaction beyond the actual card draft.

I finally decided to play the game. It works really well. I adjusted my rating, according to what I think of the game. I will keep in mind the way that campaign was handled when I see one of their games on KS, though. 

KS. I haven't tried the game yet but the box arrived in a bad condition... Sturdy game box but too much void inside had for bad consequence to see the components travel as much in the box as the game itself... provoking big damage inside. The card stacks were also mostly unwrapped when the game arrived and some of the tiles were stuck into the insert, creating a bit more damage. 

I will rate the game once I have played it. I will give it a 6 for now, without playing it, just for the condition of the game when it arrived.

This game plays out similarly to Suburbia where you place tiles in a grid and the adjacency of one card to another benefit each other differently. The cards are drafted using the 7 Wonders drafting mechanism. Very simple game but certainly could lead to some AP as the grid of cards grow to an enormous size in later rounds. The Harvest Phase is quite solitaire (even for a guy who appreciate solitaire euro). 

I'm not sure about the replayability of this game. Seems like the game is all about converting water to grain, then grain to money and money to end game scoring buildings. Quite repetitive even within the 4 rounds of a single game. I would say this is just an OK game, not bad but not great.

RATING: 4
This is a tile drafting, tableau building game. A small twist is that each player chooses their initial hand of tiles from 4 different decks. There are cards that score end game points, others that help with converting water to food, ect... You take 6 cards total, so in a 4p game you end up with 2 cards from the hand you select (normal take one, pass the rest drafting). This gives you some level of control about what you see, and what other players see. In a game without staggered decks (like 7 Wonders's ages) this is a nice addition.

The game has a steep engine building element. There are only 4 rounds so things accelerate fairly quickly. You can convert water into food, food into money, money buys you more expensive tiles some of which can score you points. There are many effects that ask you to do set collection, sometimes with an element of geometry. Like having so many fields within 2 spaces.

A lot of thought has to go into making sure that the harvest phase works out. A lot of the engine building cards activate during the harvest phase and you need to be producing the correct amount of stuff and using the correct amount of stuff so that you can activate all of your tiles.

All of this sounds fine, and I guess it is on some level. However, the game is very much a solitary affair. Your head is so consumed with your little farming empire you hardly have time to look up. Which is just as well because aside from hate drafting (and trash talking) there is nothing you can do to affect your opponents. Even hate drafting isn't easy because you would need to assess their farm which is often more trouble than it's worth.

For example, during the harvest phase players simultaneously activate all their stuff. It takes several minutes and there is no reason to give a hoot what others are doing. You could go around the table and watch each person, but you just don't care what they're doing.

This is a solo game, and not a very compelling one at that. Build engine, hope for synergy, do tedious calculations to make sure you aren't overflowing with grain/water during the harvest, repeat.

Very bland. I played Among the Stars once and thought it was okay (rated it 6). I would need to play it again to do justice to a comparison. Fields of Green was not for me

Played this only once but i'm convinced. I have a feeling that with a high score of 52 we are not the champions, but I really like the engine building  that is fluid and clear. No dice as in Machi Koro and that fact alone can be the reason to buy this one. I like the artwork, the game play,... Problem can be that you get lost in the overview. So much details to take into account. It would really be a bummer if you miscalculated your water or food supply. I will surely do a small review of this game on our website.

Not as charming as I'd hoped and I can't place my finger on exactly why... I suppose I wanted a greater degree of elegance or mechanisms that lend itself to better "storytelling" so to speak. The satisfaction I get out of developing a project and having it blossom into success or crash into failure is lacking for me here.
Nevertheless it's still a heartwarming game in its own way with a theme I romanticize :) 
It is a SERIOUS table hog, which I never would have guessed. 

On a side note, I'm pretty irritated by the large box size relative to its contents. Absolute nonsense. Space is precious.

Disclaimer: I haven't played Among the Stars. Fields of Green is to Among the Stars what Imperial Settlers was to 51st State: bringing the game down to Earth with some nice, clear visuals, colorful artwork and possibility to combine stuff for ten minutes, looking at your own display. But there's nothing wrong with it, it's quite good for what it is (even with its blatant way of copying the 7 wonders mechanism for a tile-laying game), and even though I can't name anything I can really recommend it for, I don't really have any problems with it either. Water towers bring water, fields use water to grow food, animals eat food to produce money, constructions help you in different ways (even with equipments) and buildings score you points in the end (and optionally you can even add event cards to the mix). It's rather straightforward; not bad.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this one and initially think it is more interesting than Among the Stars with the addition of the water/grain and the economy system. Perhaps it will tend towards playing in one of a few different styles as the cards are learned, but at this point I am looking forward to exploring the game more and the card interactions. The farming theme is one  I always enjoy although I'm not convinced every card makes sense for what it is! Five different types of cards lead to potentially quite different styles of farming.

We picked this one up on Kickstarter - and I am glad we did! 

Fields of Green is a very easy engine building game. I think we have played it every night since we got it! It is great to unwind at the end of the day. My favorite part is that they have allowed for the drafting mechanic to work well even in a 2 player game with the altered two player rules. The rules are simple to learn and the re-play ability is high as you can pull different varations of buildings, farms, constructions, and animals each turn.  

The art work is very well done - you can see the farm grow as you continue to work on .

I believe this is going to become a staple in our collection.

I love engine building games so this game naturally grabbed my attention.  I like how you have to puzzle out how best to lay out your farm - due to water needs, livestock bonuses, etc.  I also enjoy having to manage my resources during the harvest phase to make sure things are executed in the most advantageous order.

I hate the thick cards.  Difficult to shuffle.  It also seems like if I lose my grip while shuffling, then a top card or two could get bent.  

I feel like this game will start to feel a bit same-y since there isn't a lot of card variety.  Right now, I'm thinking I may be able to get 20-25 plays before I need to move on from this game, unless there are expansions that add more variety.  I feel like that's an acceptable amount of play for the price.

Update after 6 plays: Traded it away for now.  Still find it enjoyable, but it was competing for time with other tableau & engine building games like Imperial Settlers & Race for the Galaxy,  Would happily play someone else's copy.  A smaller box (currently over-sized for the amount of components in it) would have kept it on my shelf much longer.  I aggressively cull large boxes out of my collection - needs to be one of my favorites to hold a spot long term.

I played this before I got my eye prescription changed so I could barely read the text which made for a pretty difficult time. Because it is basically multiplayer solitaire and is kind of complex, it would be easy to make mistakes when counting up requirements or points and there is a fair amount of this. Also, the game is a table hog.  Had to keep moving my whole farm to make sure it didn't overlap with my neighbor's farm.  So a lot of issues, but what I do like is the drafting, the sense of progression, and the variety of cards.

Good game.  But I give half vote less, because the material quality it isn't very good, at all. It's a pity... Just because for the Kickstarter's successfull iniziative , it'd be better to spend in best way our money ... ????

UPDATING After 3 months:
Fermo restando quanto detto sopra, il gioco è piacevole, scorrevole e anche un pochino interattivo in 2 persone (lo qualifico come un'ottimo "duel"!); in 3 giocatori è ancora passabile (se giocato un po' "di pancia" e senza controllare troppo quel che fanno gli altri). Ma in 4 è decisamente noioso, autistico (se nn vuoi stare 3 ore al tavolo nn ti devi interessare a quello che fanno gli altri, tanto il gioco va lostesso) e necessità di un tavolo enorme: What A BORING!...

Suburbia meets 7 Wonders. Solid game. I would only play with the event cards if they are all shown prior to the start of the game.

Unlike others, I believe there is player interaction. You need to look at your opponents' farms and cash on hand to figure out your best card to draft. You may want one card the most, but it may be better to draft another first, knowing the one you really want will make it back to you. You may also want to play or trash a card that would be very powerful for an opponent.

This is an excellent drafting and tableau building game. I really love how you get to decide what types of cards go into your hand, so there's an added level of strategy just there, and I especially love the 2-player drafting variant where you shuffle together both hands of cards and then draft openly from a selection of six cards at a time.

You work to build up your farm, you use water for fields to produce food, food for the livestock to earn money and money to invest in structures and buildings in order to get equipment and points. It's essentially an engine building game, it's all about investing so you can make the most efficient farm.

However there are different paths you can take to with, which is also something I really like. In my first game, I only ever decided to invest in three fields, and only two of them had water upkeep, meaning I could sustain my food production with only the water I got at the beginning of each round, and I only invested in the livestock that food production could sustain, focusing mainly on buildings and constructions, which earned me a lot of endgame points. My opponent mainly focused on fields and livestock, which both earned him more points in the locations themselves and more excess money than me, which also translated into points. In the end there was only a handful of points that separated us.

Very thematic tableau builder with drafting
There is a lot of upkeep to keep track of but that will probably be better after multiple plays. A very enjoyable first experience - negatives are that you need a LOT of table space (much more than a general board game) and the fact that it's only at the very end that you know how well you did. Much better than its predecessor Among the stars. Keep in mind that it's a very solitary experience though so interaction is very minimal, even for our taste.

This game offers a fantastic level of depth and replay factor with what I feel are clean, simple rules. Now, I will say that it can induce some serious AP, and for newer players, it can certainly make them feel like they have too many things to juggle. However, I personally think that these things can be seen as positives for the game as well. I like that there are several things to keep track of and that I have to watch my money as well as my water supply, my food production, etc. Having that pressure while also building an engine and trying to score as many points as I can is fun for me. I look forward to playing more and more in the future.

Played at DTC 2017.  This is a more involved version of Among the Stars.  More resources to track, but keeps many of the same mechanisms from in AtS.  For me, though I am normally a heavier weight gamer, but in this case I preferred the simplicity of AtS.  Also enjoyed the theme more.  I liked that they got away from the very heavily used theme of space, but diving right into the other heavily used theme of farming was not enough to hook me.

Although it's a shame that the game insert arrived in post-apocalyptic destruction state due to shipping violence and that component quality is sub-par, this is nonetheless a great game that may appeal to fans of Suburbia or Imperial Settlers. Little downtime involved as this is simultaneous drafting but hard decisions coupled with sometimes tight resource management will satisfy more experienced players. Although the game looks compact, you'll need a BIG table to fit every players in. The Event cards (Kickstarter) are also a nice addition. I think the game could have benefitted from 1 less action per round for a tighter gameplay.

Needlessly tedious. Played a 4er, and I would sum up my experience as, "I could do this better, but why bother?" Somehow motive got lost for me in the face of too many resources, too little constraint, and it's simply uninteresting to optimize "Get 3 currency X for every resource Y within 2 spaces" vs "Get 2 currency Z for every 2 resource Y within 1 space" -- akin to figuring out the most optimally-priced package of toilet paper at the grocery store.

Fields of Green is a tile-laying game that uses a 7 Wonders-style closed draft mechanic. Players are drafting various fields, pastures, and buildings to place in their personal farm space, many of which produce or score differently depending on their proximity to other tiles. This is the type of game where you have to build up an income engine first, and then find ways to convert things to points. There are a number of different routes that players can take to be successful. I thought this game was decent, but it didn't really stand out.

[thing=110277][/thing] but with farming. There are a few notable differences like you are drafting your initial 6 cards from different stacks to help define your strategy for the round. You are still drafting and tableau building. Cards play off each other in similar ways you might find in Among the Stars but there is also harvest time which include feeding that will happen. I definitely enjoyed this more than the predecessor. If you liked the first you will like this one.

RATING: 7
Overall:
Fields of Green is an enjoyable game. I haven't done 2player yet, which was what sold me on the game (seeing rhado's review).

Artwork:
The art is so detailed it looks a bit muddy on the small cards. I do wish there was a bit more pop, even if it is supposed to be a farming game. Sometimes super realistic doesn't work to sell the fun.

Graphics Design:
Pretty big failure in the game. From the coins and VP tokens to the card frames, all aspects of the GFXD fall flat.

Gameplay:
The game does feel pretty solo. I am a fan of tactical drafting and burning (hate drafting as the emotionally sensitive call it) -- but unfortunately, it is hard to do w/ the amount of duplicates. I'd really love for there to be a higher level of interaction with other players -- similar to 7 wonders, some resource buying from neighbors would go a long way in at least incentivizing you to look at what your neighbor is doing.

The geometric puzzle is very satisfying to try and solve and a differentiator from 7 wonders. Planning the farm layout was the best part of the game by far and after the first playthrough, left me wanting to try different starting shapes to facilitate batter layouts in rounds 3 and 4.

Having a farm specialty and/or 'secret missions' may add a bit more excitement to the draft.

Components:
The food/water tokens are nice. I do wish they had a bit more height, as they're a bit hard to pick up if you have larger fingers. The coins and vp tokens, as stated, were pretty terrible. The card quality on all the cards was good, and the rule book quality was also good. The insert arrived destroyed, but wasn't super handy anyway. I wound up making a custom insert which was much nicer and assists greatly with setup. Some cards score really well based on the number of water tokens you have at the end of the game (meaning you build water towers but don't consume the water). The creators did not take this into account, as the game shipped with far to few water tokens. This was quite frustrating, as it affects end game scoring, and we had the person implementing this strategy, having to unload water tokens from his cards so that other players could perform upkeep actions through rounds 3 and 4.

Mechanics:
Tile placement is stressful. Lots of potential combos provide the main thinking point of the game. The draft priming (where you select cards from different groupings to weight the draft in your favor), are neat, and something I'd like to see in more games. However, in a 4 player game, there seemed to be enough variety, such that the weighting didn't really assist all that much in influencing gameplay (a bit of a bummer). The upkeep mechanic is really great and seems to be the main driver of the game, outside of victory points. Shutting down of fields will weigh heavily on you as you struggle to keep everything going (love it).

I haven't played Among the Stars, but I'm not much for a space theme (I don't really care about theme).  From what I can tell, this game has a quicker setup, which is always nice.

It's quick and easy with a good depth of strategy. You will need a fairly large table though (probably my only negative criticism).

This game has some elements of other "city building" games that I really enjoy.  You must always be mindful of how tiles effect each other.

Also, the drafting is great!

I liked this game just fine. I really enjoy drafting. I especially liked how you could customize the starting hands to have a certain number of the different types of cards. Placing tiles and managing your resources was a fun puzzle to solve. My real problem was with the confusing wording of the tiles at times. For that reason it would be hard to play on an even playing field unless everyone has already played before.

I played it only once in Essen. It reminded me of 7Wonders with its drafting mechanism, however in Fields of Green I lay out the cards in front of me in a 2D grid, and positions in the grid matter.

The only good thing is that it sets up and plays quick, that's about it. There's just nothing exciting with this game.  Theres no tension, no suspense.  The only decision to be made is the placement of cards but even that is bit random b/c the nature of card drafting.  Hard to tell if everyone is doing their actions correctly due the small text on the cards.  Just a boring and fiddly game.

A simple card laying game, but has some interesting proximity mechanics. The box is way too large; it could have easily been half the size. I would have bought it had it not been $50. The only reason I can see to explain the cost would be the quality of the meeples. The water meeple is shaped like a water drop, and the food like a bundle of freshly cut wheat, that costs a bit more from what I gather... but that doesn't explain all of the cost.

RATING: 5
Inoffensive engine-building game, that seems to be lacking several somethings. Thematically it is something of a pleasant change to play modern day farming rather than mediaeval era, although no one seems to have told whoever choose the font for the game title - and again, harvesting fields of watermelon to feed your sheep is a bit... odd. The thematic disconnect between what the various cards do and how they interact which is a bit disappointing. May well be a decent solo game in there  - but multi-player interaction is practically non-existent - even taking into consideration the drafting mechanism that while supposedly the heart of the game, is in reality completely dispensable. Players may as well draw a hand from the decks on offer then play the hand out - it'd speed things up, and save anyone having to put too much effort into hate-drafting (hate-drafting looking very difficult to achieve in this game as players get control over the hands they draw, and there seem to be plenty copies of most  - indeed you see the same cards over and over throughout the game) Now if there was then some kind of central market for players to sell to, with variable demand, over-supply to avoid, prices to manipulate - well, this isn't that game, and i guess it'd take another Kickstarter stretch goal to reach that level of development... Takes a bit too long to slog thru, the sprawling farms end up taking a lot of table space, and the strategy  - I suspect - is not even as deep as 7 wonders, although there are probably powerful combos to find, and players may enjoy exploring that.

Clearly one of my favourite games of all times - it took "amog the stars" which I enjoyed very much, to a totally new level. I just can't get enough if the care and planning you invest in this efficiency engine to see your prospering farm - a unique and very exciting and rewarding experience. In addition, this game makes you feel smart, when you puzzle out optimal combos of three or even more cards. Everyone, who loves balancing short term and long term goals, a deep jet easy spatial puzzle and the drafting dilemma where timing is essential shoud give this game a try.

It works and the theme is nice, but it's not exactly exciting. There's a smidgen of tension near the end as you try and maximise your points here and there, but for the most part you can see the writing on the wall way in advance. I liked it, but it just didn't have a hook to keep me that interested in exploring it much further.

Certainly the rules are extremely easy to pick up and teach. The theme makes good sense and helps with the ease of remembering rules.

Unfortunately the playing is very much on the fiddly side. There's a constant resolution of cards providing resources for other cards that then provide something for another card elsewhere. What the other players are doing is almost irrelevant. Sure, deny them something when you pick cards up or pass them on, but for the most part you're in your own little puzzle world. The two player game has a better level of interaction than with three or four and I can recommend trying that if you're looking for less of a solo experience.

It's okay. It will certainly appeal to some gamers over others and I imagine those that like low interaction building and delivering games might enjoy this one.

Received as a gift from my cousin. Tableau building game with many strategic decisions to make as you try to build the most productive farm.  You need to pay attention to what your opponent is doing as well if you want to outmaneuver in the final season. Artwork is cool.  Look forward to playing again.

Fields of Green is a fun card drafting game similar to Among the Stars, but with the addition of harvests at the end of every round. You need to balance your water and food needs for fields and livestock respectively, and build an engine to generate money. Failing to keep your engine running smoothly will result in cards flipping over, which denies you the points on those cards and prevents you from using them again unless you waste a whole turn reactivating them. Overall it's a decent game, but I feel like the cards should have been a little more interesting.

This is a card drafting and placement game with a farming theme. While the card drafting and placement rules were interesting (each player selects what type of cards will be in the draft), nothing is overly unique about this game and seems to be a rehash of other games. I would play again, just not sure I would suggest it. Definitely not a bad game, just not very original.

This is where I put my personal notes about a game for my own reference. It is not meant as a review. Although I really enjoy Fields of Green!

Comparison to Among the Stars (Abbreviated). Garry Rice: Some reasons  to prefer Fields of Green: 1. Players get to choose the mix of cards they draw to try and increase your chances of drawing a particular card if desired. (AtS mixes them?) 2. I really like the equipment tiles in FoG. You don't need them, but they are fun to play with. 3. For me, farming is a much more interesting theme than a space station for this type of game. Jason: FoG is easier to setup. Charlie: FoG is more thematic, and is the deeper game.

The two-player mechanic of each player choosing the cards then shuffling the two sets together is quite cool. It's possible to get a little overthinky, thanks to the card variety, but that same variety is what gives FoG an edge, too. Just remember that the one building card has a typo and should read Laughter House. *Laughter* House. you know, where you cuddle the ducks and bunnies (who are a wise early investment, by the way).

Got a hydroponics farm.
10/10 Would grow hydroponic geese again

Bought some cereal fields
Bought some more cereal fields
Bought even more cereal fields
Could not get a brewery
10/10 Would fail to make alcohol again

These are just a few of the interesting combos that you can put together in the game.

This is a really enjoyable drafting game with a spacial element.  I really enjoy the farming theme, particularly the fact that it is modern farming.  I've only played it as a two player game, but the two player drafting rules are probably my favorite take on drafting - I like that there is public knowledge of the available cards.  I like them so much that I would like to devise an adapted version of them and use them if I ever play at higher player counts.

This is one of the first games that I have ever backed on kickstarter, and I am very, very glad that I did.

I really enjoy the multiple levels of resource management - water, food, money.  Aside from the fact that it can support seven players, this game is no my go to game over 7 Wonders if I have 4 or less players, and that is saying quite a bit, because I really enjoy 7 wonders.

There is already good variety in the game, and I feel that it has lots of replayability, but I am hoping for lots of expansions - the number of crops and livestock is great out of the box and there are no real omissions, but I would still love to see the game grow.

I feel that the rules are straightforward enough that it is very easy to teach a new player, even a non-gamer, but the puzzly decisions are deep enough that  a serious board gamer will find plenty of depth to enjoy.

This is a game that is going to be in my collection for a very, very long time (if not forever).

One of the things that I appreciate the most about the game is that it has a relatively short play time, but it has enough depth to elevate it over filler.  I think that this is actually fairly unusual.  If anything, I enjoy the game enough that I actually wish that it was longer... but it's short enough that it's feasible to fit in multiple plays during a single gaming session. 

If you like 7 Wonders or other drafting games, if you like the farming theme, you should definitely give this one a try.

I have to admit... I make animal noises every time I add livestock to my farm...

Fields of green is a terrific engine building game!
You build up your farm with up to 6 new cards every round (cards are being placed on the table adjacent to each other). The way the cards are being placed next to other cards gives you different scoring abilities and/or resources you can use during the game. 
The object of the game is to build a working farm - the crops needs to be watered, the animals needs to be fed and you need to keep a close eye on your income to be able to buy the good cards you really need to expand your farm. 
The art in this game is amazing! There is so much detail on the cards and one of the resources are little, wooden water droplets. All of that gives the game a great thematic feel to it as you watch your farm getting bigger and bigger and better and better as you build up your engine. 
The only problem with this game is that it can go a little too long if you are playing with inexperienced players. 

Finally, a little tip! Turn on some American country music to bring that little extra something! ;)

BGG 1 description "Clearly broken"

Well my game arrived and it was clearly broken.  All cards had come out of shrink wrap and 12 were creased and unplayable.  Chits were unpunched and awful quality.

I have emailed and they have promised replacements but 18 days later they haven't arrived...

Will presumably move from a 1 once I can actually play the game.

love the way BGG has a category for broken :)

Edit: Replacement cards arrived on 1st Feb.  I now need to play the game and rate it.
Edit 2: Sold without playing.  Having waited 6 weeks from receipt to replacement parts I had no desire to play.

Kickstarted.

Played once and had no desire to play it again. Good luck finding the energy to lean over and assess each players farm every single time you draft a card. The cards are difficult to tell apart with plenty of small text.

Lots of the cards are way too similar in function, which makes them boring to draft. "this one gives you 2 water for 1 grain" and "this one gives 1 water and 1 victory point for 2 grain". Not once did I get the feeling of "Yes, I really wanted this card!" while drafting. So you end up caring very little about what you pick, and you don't care what other players are picking either. The only cards that are remotely interesting are the purple buildings which give end game vp's.

The 2nd half of a round is the harvest phase which itself is a chore activating all the boring abilities on your cards. "This one gives me 1 water", "this one gives me 2 grain for 2 water", aaaarrrgh...they are so boring!. The harvest phase is also played simultaneous, so players could be making all sorts of mistakes and you wouldn't know it.

The game is a massive table hog, so I hope you have a very large table if you plan to play with more than 2!

Update: Don't like Artipia's shady tactics of offering promo cards in exchange for positive reviews...I will avoid Artipia in future.

RATING: 7.5
tl;dr: the same but maybe slightly better

I've always liked [thing=110277][/thing]. It's like [thing=68448][/thing], but adds a spacial element and, most of all, it's set in space!
Now this game has been ported to a more generic (but also more popular) farming theme... and it's an improvement. The reason for that is not so much the rules changes, which might or might not be better (I need more plays for that), but the fact that it is more thematic. In among the stars you build some kind of space casino and it gives you points for purple. Whatever that means. But in this game you need water to grow food and food to grow animals. That makes sense. It just makes the game easier to grasp. Not that the other one was hard, but this one is just slightly easier in that regard.
But in the end the games are very similar and I don't feel the need to own both. If you own neither and don't care about the space theme, then get this version.

7 Wonders like card drafting, then vaguely Alhambra-ish placement, but with distance relationships between many cards. Add an economic engine, but with only money, water, food, and VPs. Would take more plays to decide on this game. Might happen, might not.

I tend to think it needs a start card that includes the annual upkeep effects. The game has two mechanisms where one would suffice.

First play impression: a definite improvement over Among the Stars.

Among the Stars is purely an exercise in math. Pay this much to get this many points, or pay that much to get that many points. Fields of Green has you managing two types of "energy" where Among the Stars only has one, so you now have more to consider each turn instead of pure math.

It's still not perfect, though. There are still a few issues that Among the Stars also has: the randomness of the cards can be substantial, the game takes up a ton of table space, and it is very fiddly.

The fiddliness: at the end of every round is a harvest phase and you have to look through all of your cards, find the ones that have a harvest ability, and carry out the abilities in the order of your choice. You'll be generating water from one card, then using that water to pay for food from another card, then generating money from another card and using that to pay for something else. It's an okay little puzzle, but just so fiddly.

So overall I would play it again. The system still has nowhere near the depth and fun of 7 Wonders, but this is a big step in the right direction. If only they can eventually get rid of some of the issues that still plague the series.

Farming retheme of Among The Stars.  I like it better because it's farming (and apparently all good games have farm stuff) and easier to learn.  Really great 2-player drafting replacement which I may try out in 3-4 player games.

RATING: 3
Cute theme where you build a farm with other players. However there is zero interaction with other players other than handing over the next hand for card drafting. You just solitaire build your farm out and try to plan out your resource management. The rules were generally simple, but there are lots of quirky ways cards can play off each other. The cards are varied but at the same time not easily indistinguishable. So in the end it was an interesting foray to a quirky title, but I am very hesitant to play it again. The simple mechanics can get very complex, and the strategy is completely random. Add in the non existent play interaction and you got a pretty boring game of silently playing and passing cards interspersed with chain-able card events. I did like the wooden components though.

A logical next step from Among The Stars, a really, really good game.  That makes this every bit as good of a game but do keep in mind it removes a lot of the player interaction and distills down to the eruo game more which may or may not be for you.

Kickstarted.  Comes with Kickstarter promo cards (mini-expansions).  I believe these are available for sale later but enjoy both of these.  Comments under the promo cards.

I like this game.  A great card drafting and card placement game.  The mechanics are great.  The artwork is good.  Plays reasonably quick since it's only played over 4 rounds.  Wish it was longer but there probably wouldn't be enough room for more cards to be played.  I enjoy the 2-player pooled selection area rather than pick a card and pass it.  Allows for some planning without having to remember what you passed to the other player and what you are expecting to get back.  I like the flexibility of card selection.  Being able to choose what cards you want to see is great rather than getting a blind draw of types.  I like that there are equipment tiles that get added to the cards as an enhancement or if they go unused, turns into a victory point.

Strongly wish there was more player interaction.  Not player conflict but more peaceful interaction...IE trading/selling, market competition or contracts.  Something that makes the players decisions indirectly affects players besides the card drafting.

Fields of Green is a drafting game (essentially the same game as Among the Stars) where you're building a farmstead. Cards come in four flavors: fields, livestock, construction and buildings (mostly point scoring stuff). In each round, you take some combination of 6 cards from these piles. You must have at least 3 types of cards, but there's no restriction other than that. Then you start drafting.

Cards usually cost either money, water or grain. Alternatively, you can discard a card to get money (and a bit more if you pay grain). Or you can discard a card to buy a water tower (which comes with water) or a grain silo (which doesn't come with anything but gives you space to store grain).

Then there's a harvest phase where you pay water and grain (and sometimes money) to operate your farm. Grain can teleport but water has a distance restriction and can only move two spaces away from a tower.

There's a lot of scoring opportunities that key off of adjacencies, proximities or simply having the right types of tiles.

There's things to think about in this game and it was a fun game to play. I'd love to play more of this. In our game players went with very different strategies but the final spread was very tight (usually a sign of a well-balanced game).

Re-themed version of Among The Stars, with some more meat to it than its predecessor. I especially like that in this game you can choose which card types you want to draft at the start of each turn. The thing that I do not like, is that it involves a lot of counting (revenue vs cost) each turn, and that it sometimes feels like a solitaire excercise of the brain. So I would play again, but will probably not be the one who suggests it - it is feels more dry than Among The Stars.

Card drafting, tableau building, resource management. There are many mechanics I really like in this - and while this game don't feel innovative it just feels so smooth and satisfying to play. I really like all the different cards that are in the game - and it should provide many different strategies to go for. Important to keep an eye on what cards you give to your opponents.

While the 7 wonders type drafting seems to have been done a lot recent years, I never seem to tire of it.

Two drawbacks:
- Requires a huge table
- We actually ran out of water tokens when playing with 4, wish they could have included a litte bit more of the resource tokens in the box

I like what this game was trying to do - iterate and improve Among the Stars. The two are clearly linked and I liked that this had some additional complexity via the equipment, water towers, silos, multiple decks, etc.

Ultimately, it became a little too fiddly for me. We only played the introductory version and while I like the card drawing rules it felt like overkill for a 45m game. Finally, I just enjoyed the science fiction theme and artwork of AoS more.

Fun game. Based on Among the Stars, which is based on 7 Wonders: a drafting game where each player play cards to their own grid, and the layout matters. For instance, watertowers can provide fields with water (but within a limited range). 
You have to build up an economy were you generate money to buy more cards. Or generate food to feed your animals or to sell at the market. 
Lots of rules, lots of text, but made intuitive by the theme. Bit mathy though, and took a bit too long.

This may become one of my favorite drafting games (that is, a game in which I have a hand of cards, choose one, and pass the others, rinse, and repeat). I had very low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. I love how you draw cards from four different decks, and then draft. This gives you information about what type of cards not only you've selected, but your opponents. This makes this less random, and swingy than most drafting games.

I also love that there's a spatial aspect, akin to tile laying. This feels very puzzle-like. The resource management part, of money, food, and water is also very nice. You need water for your Fields, they generate Food, which is needed for your Livestock, which grant you Money. The theme fits, and it all is very easy to grasp.

The one nitpick is that the graphics are a bit muted. I wish that they popped more, but it's hard to spot the exact Fields, Livestock, Constructions, or Buildings your opponents have in their own tableau.

This game has a lot going on.  I like being able to seed the draft with the types of cards you are looking for, I like the spatial aspect of placing most of the cards in your tableau and I think the engine building works well too.  Add in the nice art and you have an extremely solid game.  But since there are so many cards that do so many things it can be quite difficult to keep track of what your opponents are up to making this feel a bit more solo than I like these days so I don't think it will ever be a favorite for me.

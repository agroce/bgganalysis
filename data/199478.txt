Fun, quick and tight little game. Great for my work-lunch group or for a casual race game. Goes toe to toe with Formula D (as a basic race) and a better game than Ave Caesar, IMO. 

The more I play the more I like and have painted the minis! 
I now decree this better than Formula D - at least for grown ups :)

As a racing game and a fast one at that, this is really fantastic. The production quality is good - the plastic bicycles are arguably the weakest component (one broke while playing our first game). They need to be handled carefully. But the other components are very nice. The colors are distinct enough (thankfully!) and the cards and boards are very good. The gameplay is nearly trivial - subtle perhaps describes it better - in that you have to time your card usage. We did prove that you can win due to not strategy but simply playing the best cards - but you cannot do this reliably. Better is to time your cards and pacing. Best of all, it *feels* like I imagine a bike race feels. Overall, thumbs up and very enjoyable!

As a cycling fan I enjoyed the game greatly, and I think it managed to capture the essence of cycling quite well. While drafting is an important aspect of the sport you cannot be too passive and have to react to everything that happens around you. It was good to see that an early breakaway can hold to the very end, if the chasers are not at the top of things. Different courses reward different tactics, which is also nice. However, you have to remember that in the end this is a card game which introduces some elements of luck into the game. Moreover, the game is not too realistic, since it is essentially a game of outguessing your opponents' moves.

For the gameplay, the mechanics is a bit vulnerable since you will be having cards on eight different decks, i.e., for both riders you have the draw deck, the active card,  the discard pile and the removed cards. At least I made a few errors during the game when I either put the cards into a wrong pile or drew from the wrong deck. It is not too bad but will take some time before you get used to it.

I also liked the looks and the decision to use vintage style. The only bigger minus comes from the artist taking shortcuts with the portraits of the riders who look exactly the same except for the amount of facial hair. They have the exact same posture, body proportions, impression and face. Why, I  have to ask. This just leaves a bitter sidenote to an otherwise good game making you think of a hurriedly finished product. Nevertheless, these are just minor details and I have to say that Flamme Rouge is a very good implementation of the sport into boardgame format.

Not really variation as shape of board doesn't affect gameplay at all. Hills are quite minor element also. Reverse deckbuilder mechanic is nice but this needs also a game. One good mechanic is not enough.

Super-simple and tense racing game.  The deck-building is a neat leveling mechanic that also supports the racing simulation itself!  Great production.  Looking forward to a play of the advanced game.

RATING: N/A
Interesting game, but I didn't like it enough to want to play it again.  It felt like most of the game is trying to predict the unpredictable (how far will the pack go this turn) and you have to save your best card for last, in order to have a better chance to win.

It makes sense in terms of theme, most races require a last-ditch effort to cross the finish line, but it just ended up with the gameplay feeling a bit flat.

I really love this game.  It gives the the excitement of a racing game (Thunder Alley is one of my favorites), but it plays pretty quickly.  The deck thinning aspect is really great and leads to more strategy than you would think.  I like that there is a real strategy to do your best to stay in the middle of the pack.  But being able to work your two bikers in a team is hugely beneficial.  I love it.  Love it.

RATING: 8
A quite minimalist take on the cycle racing game that is about conserving energy and positioning yourself for that final sprint to the line.  Flamme Rouge's treatment of climbs feels right, while descents provide an opportunity to eke more out of low value cards.  After a first game won by selecting my lowest cards until the end was in sight, I feared that Flamme Rouge might be a little too simple.  The next race on a different course using the same strategy saw me blocked at key points and learning that this game has a little more depth than first appears.  It gives me just about everything I want from a cycle racing game in a streamlined and fast playing package.

Production quality is very good and the retro artwork is charming.   I have read some gripes about the difficulty of reading the R on the rouler and S on the sprinter, but the two are different sculpts so telling them apart isn't hard (though quite what a sprinter is doing in a sit up and beg pose, I don't know).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good solid racing game for up to 4 players. My 9 and 12 year old play it fine. A modular track sees a lot of possibilities for variation. A lot of tactical play involved, a little bit of counting.

I'd like to see more variation between the Rouler and Sprinteur cards AND minis as it can sometimes get confusing. Fix the minis with a dab of paint maybe.

Looking forward to getting the expansion anyway.

This has to be one of my favourite games for the sole reason that it is so easy to play. I have a lot of friends who will not fall into the category of hardcore gamers and this game is, for me at least, the perfect compromise. 

The theme comes through hard in this game, it feels like you're actually in a cycling race. Trying to get the best position, considering whether to go on a breakaway, and so on. If you have an interest in cycling this game is perfect, if you don't it's still really, really good.

I was blown away by its simple mechanics which really is a backward playing deck builder with a very fun and good cycling theme attached.

You need to spare the good cards (energy) and avoid getting bad ones (fatigue) by pulling too much at the head of the peleton or in an escape.

One of the very few games I would recommend to anyone. Thematic gamer (cycling), euro gamer, abstract gamer etc ...

And on top ... there is a solo module by the designer found on the BGG pages !

Simple and Fun !Now you can create multiple stages within a Tour and it is even supported by an App to track the end results !

A race game that has a strong "play the players" aspect. Winning is not just who can stay in the lead as you actually want to be part of the pack for a while. It feels like a game that doesn't have a huge amount of replayability as most games seem like they would play out similarly but it also would make for close finishes.

Fun, fast, and simple. Slipstreaming and hills help accentuate the theme, but nothing feels unnecessary and the game is very streamlined.

Nice race game.  I like how the cards work and how the track will vary.  Card management is big in this and patience is also needed.  With the tracks, you have to plan out what you really need to do when the time comes (and hopefully you have the appropriate cards to complete your plan).  Timing is everything.

Played twice more.  Bumped rating to 8.  It's simple but you get the feel of a bike race.  I lump this in with Duell (Knitzia) as a fun, sporting game.

A fairly simple racing game where players are using decks of cards to get their cyclists across the finish line. Players will use cards to expend energy and position themselves in the race. The game play was fine, but I didn't really find anything that intriguing about the game. There are some interesting decisions about how to time things, but I would personally rather spend my time playing other games. With all of that said, I can see the appeal as a fairly light racing game with a deck thinning element and the production and box art are beautiful.

This is a pretty simple strategy game. If you can guess your opponents likely moves, play your cards right and you’ll be the first to cross the finish line! I like how easy it is to see how the game mechanics mimic the some of the cycling sport’s mechanics. On a side note, the amount of card shuffling this game requires means that quality card protectors should be necessary for long term use.

It's good to see that simple, elegant games still get made. despite the small number of gameplay mechanics, the connection to bicycle racing is tangible. There's mountain climbing, slipstreaming and leader fatigue and it all comes down to timing your energy distribution for the two cyclers you control.

The visual style is great and really conveys the 1950's vibe. I would've liked the cycler models to be distinguishable more. It's easy to confuse the sprinter and the all-rounder.

Flamme Rouge is one of the best games in the racing genre. It is a very tense experience that always comes down to the wire. The tight decision making balances out the finicky hand management. The Peloton expansion improves the base game in every way. However, the retail price for both is $95 ($60, $35) which is absurd given the poor Stronghold quality. If you like racing games, check out Flamme Rouge but know that Peloton is a must buy.

A super simple racing game of simultaneous programmed movement. Players program their two cyclists, reveal, and move the cyclists accordingly. trying to put their riders in a position to slipstream, which gives them free extra movement, and trying not to get too far ahead or fall too far behind too often, which will fatigue the riders.

I found it almost too simple, and while I won, wasn't really sure what I did to win, as I didn't feel like there were a lot of meaningful choices or control. I still had some fun playing it and laughing at the movement results, which often resulted in the ruin of well-made plans. It was a bit odd, as the entertainment value more came from wacky results of pre-programmed movement, and not in the winning of the race.

RATING: 8
An excellent, yet light bicycle racing game. Using two different riders, each one with a different deck (but same as any other player's), you are called to best manage your energy to race first to the finish. There is an aspect of luck, since you draw 4 and play 1, most of which can be mitigated by knowing your deck distribution and calculating some elementary probabilities. Decisions are usually interesting, at times trivial, but also at times pivotal for the success of the team. When do you try to pull your Sprinteur forward by burning your Rouleur, when do you block others? 

Since the game is very simple to play, due to the fact that most of the complexity is baked into the decks and rules, this is a game that can be played in as light or as heavy a fashion as one wishes. Gamers will appreciate the hard solo mode, as well as the campaign game that adds quite a bit of complexity and smoothes out the probability curve. I can imagine many possible expansions with different tiles, different rider abilities (and decks), events, and a set of more elaborate subsystems to increase the complexity.

A solid quality design, and, if Lautapelit manages enough distribution in Germany, an early Spiel des Jahres candidate. This could be a viable alternative to Ticket to Ride, and has put Asger Harding Granerud, together with the most excellent 13 Days, on a must-watch designer list. Highly recommended. 

+ 2-pages of rules, yet results in a plausible racing simulation
+ no hidden trackable information, everything is open
+ quick to play, and easy to teach also to casual gamers
+ pure fun
+ lots of setup variability and a ampaign mode that seems to kick it up one notch
+ zero downtime
+ great art and components

= some mitigate-able luck
= this is not a deep strategy game, but a race-oriented tactical struggle

I really like this as a relatively light filler-esque game. It has a decent amount of strategy and rewards planning, while being thematic.

RATING: 7.3
Cycling game with 4 teams of 2 riders. Each team consists of a sprinter and a rouleur, each of which has his own card deck. Each card shows the number of squares a rider can advance on the track. Every turn a player draws 4 cards and chooses 1 to play per rider. The other 3 are placed face up underneath the draw deck. Once the face up cards are reached the deck is reshuffled. Each card is only used once.
It is clearly more a cycling game than a simulation, because there are only 8 riders involved and the cards are not individualised (the sprinters have the same cards for all 4 players, as do their rouleurs). It is not possible to leave out some cards in order to adjust the strength of the different riders.
The game does contain some interesting ideas which I really like. A rider which is pulling in front becomes more tired than the riders which are following in his wheel. This is simulated by adding exhaustion cards to that rider's deck (value = 2). I also like the way in which the peleton slipstreaming effect is created by having riders which are only 1 square behind after a turn has finished, fill this gap of 1 square.
Another nice element of the game is that you can build your own tracks with the different race track parts included in the box.

Why is this so highly rated? You just play cards and move. Very little strategy. This could be played with dice even.

Light, retro, fun race game themed on cycling.  A gradually eroding deck of movement cards simulates riders fatiguing rather well.  Reminded me a little of Ave Caesar, where every movement space counts.  The solo rules work very well.  Overall, this is an excellent, well developed design that anyone can play, and enjoy.

RATING: 6
Idea:
Race with two bicyclists against others. 

Mechanism:
You have two cyclers, roller and sprinter. Play cards to make them move, once card is played its gone. Play right cards on right spots to make advantage.
After movement each group that is only 1 square away catches the next one. If you take off you have to get strong lead enough
Cycler that is first of the pack gets fatigue card that has low speed to fill up deck.
Really catches cycling theme.

Special: Played big version of the game where each bike is like 8cm size instead of small table game.

The 'Racing Game' in my collection. And a brilliant one at that. Accessible with interesting choices. Light and intuitive, with one of the smallest rule explanations I've ever come across. Loads of fun. I've bought the Peloton expansion which i cant wait to play with too. Likely to get repeat plays in one sitting. A bit too light for my tastes, which stops it from getting a higher rating.

Simple, elegant, simulation Race games are not easy to design. Too often they suffer from runaway leader problems. Or they attempt so hard to simulate a sport that they have awkward, fiddly rules. Or they are based on mechanics which have too many random elements. But not Flamme Rouge. Flamme Rouge is a rare beast in that it nicely simulates bike racing within a very simple rule set, whilst managing to be a thrilling ride at the same time. 

You control two bikes and movement is by simple card play. There is more to the card play than, say, the very straightforward Ave Caesar, it is more strategic than that game, yet the essence of the simple card play from Ave Ceasar remains. 

You control two bikes with two decks of cards, and there is little more to it than that. It is down to the genius of the design that from such a simple and elegant premise such a strategic and exciting race evolves.

I am a fan of race games and this instantly goes to the very top of the pile.

Could this be the elusive race game that manages to finally combine the excitement of the simulated race within a simple structure and without any race-game issues? I think so.

A fantastic racing game! Based much more on strategy than on luck. It will hopefully be expanded (new tracks, additional players, perhaps a deck of event cards?), but really its simplicity is part of its charm! Brilliant design, and beautiful art design!

2016-10-18 : A quick playing bicycle racing game that oozes theme but the simultaneous card-play in combination with only being able to play the cards you draw means that guessing what your opponents are going to do is pretty impossible as you have no idea what cards they will have drawn. Normally this would knock it down to a "4", but the theme is very strong and it plays quickly, which are redeeming factors.

Solid strategic racing game. Everybody has small, somewhat differing decks for their two cyclists and chooses how far to travel from a hand of four each turn for each cyclist. The chaos and strategy comes in the uncertainty of trying to position yourself close to but never in front of the pack and choosing your opportunity to pull away and tire your cyclists for the final push to the finish line. My brother the cyclist also approves :)

RATING: 5
It's a quick and simple gateway racing game, so it delivers on what it sets out to do, but there's just not enough choices for me to be interested. I think the idea of slowly reducing your deck is great, but that means that you get fewer options available to you as the game progress, which is a shame because the end is when you want to make interesting decisions. Now the game just slowly grinds to a disappointing and predictable end. The idea of whether to choose a high or low number since the high numbers are limited is interesting in theory, but in this game sometimes you don't draw very different numbers and are robbed of that choice. Even if you do get to make a choice, it's impossible to know what will happen with 8 bikes and a bunch of drafting, so the choice doesn't feel very impactful. Perhaps it's better with fewer players, but I just think this game is too light for me.

My rating can drastically swing higher upon future plays, but in my first play, I saw a guy race out in front, grab an exhaustion card at every turn, only play two of them (both times when he was in a blue downhill zone) and crush everyone by 10-15 spaces. To me, that suggests the game is broken. He collected about a dozen exhaustion cards that he never had to play once. Instead of drawing four cards to play one, players should instead draw two or three to insure that those exhaustion cards come into play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There's some wicked hand-management stuff going on. But also some (intentional?) pressure to stay with the pack and not do much, which is not the most fun thing to spend a game doing. Still, I'd play again, if only to make good use of the things painfully learned by messing up the hilly sections my first time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Racing driven by hand management and controlling two racers at once. The best part of Flamme Rouge is the slipstream mechanic. You want to stay in the pack for a while. Choosing when to launch to the front to be first, at the cost of your endurance, to cross the finish first ends the game in an exciting crescendo.

Simple race game with a deck management aspect. Each turn you will play a card for each biker, and that card is then removed from the game. Do you use your big movement now or later? When is the time to break away from the pack? Break away too early and you'll just collect a lot of exhaustion cards...!

The track is built from many smaller segments so there is a lot of variability. ALWAYS play the game with hills, they aren't that complicated and are make the game much more interesting.

With a few simple rules and a unique theme, Flamme Rouge provides just enough interesting gameplay to make it worth a look. The difference between winning and losing can be razor-thin - true to the theme, many turns may not involve much action with only a few critical occasions changing the outcome. Looking back at the end of a game, it can be difficult to see if better decisions could have been made or if the outcome was luck, but either way, it is such a short, easy-to-learn experience that those big moments make for an enjoyable experience.

Excellent racing game. Within a simple framework, you face tough decisions, often balancing short term benefit against longer term planning in the cards you select to lay each turn. Reading your opponents in critical too.

Really fun racing game. It can start off a bit slow as people play their cards conservatively but can get pretty interesting towards the end of the race. Have only played the "starting" track. Interested to see how the hills change up the gameplay. Production value is a bit lacking. Box insert is really cheap and there can be some confusion with the cards since they have the same image on the front and back. Also, the bike rider models can be hard to distinguish at times. Hoping an upgraded reprint becomes available sometime in the future.

Players have two racers, a driver and a sprinter and each racer has their own deck of cards. The driver's cards are ranged from 3-7 and the sprinter's are ranged from 2-5 and 9. Every turn you draw four cards from one deck - pick one to play face down - and then draw four from the other deck and play one. All cards are then flipped and racers move in race order. After movement, packs of racers with one space between them and a rider ahead of them draft forward to close the gap. And then any player with no racer in front of them gets an "exhaustion" card added to their deck. All exhaustion cards have a value of 2. Cards are removed from the game after being played.

If this is all there was to it, the game would get dull pretty quick. However, most track configurations have hills, which adds another layer of hand/deck management since uphill and downhill limits or extends some of the cards you play. But where is the strategy? The card elimination is quite crafty. If you are able to manage your position well and not pick up too many exhaustion cards, towards the end of the race, your deck size could very well be the same as your hand size. Ideally, you should have good cards at the end, and NOT be dependent on a lucky draw to use them. This is the position you are fighting to be in for the entire game! Although various track configurations are included, they are all of a length that - if played well - you should be running out of cards in your deck at about the same time you finish. I think that's the one aspect that sets this game apart and makes your initial turns just as crucial as your last.

Ultimately, control might be a bit too limited for a lot of repeat plays. The experience of this game is a bit like surfing a wave into the shore. My score could rise a point if I continue to enjoy it.

Flamme Rouge is a deceptively simple racing game. Each player has a team of two cyclists, a generalist called a rouleur and a finisher called a sprinteur. The two types of cyclists have different decks. The generalists are heavy on mid-range cards, while the finisher has cards on the two extremes including the highest valued cards.

Each round you must choose a card for each of your riders by drawing the top four cards of their deck, choosing one and discarding the others. Each player does this simultaneously, then cards are revealed and cyclists moved starting at the front of the pack. The cards used to move are removed from the game. This creates a slow degradation of your decks, and leads to interesting decisions about when to use high valued cards.

After everyone has moved, slip streaming is applied. Starting at the back, each pack (contiguous group of riders) which is exactly one space behind another pack gets a free space of movement. Trying to take advantage of this free movement is one of the fun tactical elements in the game. Finally each rider at the front of a pack gains an exhaustion card, which has low rank, in their discard pile.

I love how this game, with it's almost absurdly simple rules, manages to evoke the theme of bike racing. You need to carefully consider how your riders are spending their cards. Ideally your generalist can help lead your sprinter until you are ready to attempt a break away. Anticipating other player's actions is critical.

If you get a chance to play please do not play the suggested course. Instead choose one with mountains. They add a small additional rule but really shake up the decisions throughout the race. Some people who I chatted with thought the game was a bit bland, without exception they had played the simple intro course. Everyone who opted for mountains had a higher opinion of the game.

This was so much fun we played two games of it back-to-back. The second game revealed even more tactical nuances. It's a lighter game that plays fast but offers a lot of theme and interesting decisions. For those wanting even more game there is a grand tour expansion published in the files section which links several races together into a larger competition.

This is the best racing game I recall ever playing. The game catches the theme and action of road cycling competitions in a brilliant way. There are sprinters and workhorses and the race may start in a calm way with everyone just looking around and waiting for someone to make a move. And then someone attempts to break away from the peloton. And then the leaders start to get tired and they may have spent their strength too early and others start to catch up again leading to nerve breaking approach to the finish line. The decks have been tuned splendidly and the negative deckbuilding element works well. The components are of a very nice quality and the double sided track pieces provide huge possibilities for variability and replayability. Only negative points are the box insert that doesn't physically offer enough room to store the components properly and the two riders could be more distinguishable from each other both as figures and as cards.

Have mostly played this at 2p, but would like to get more plays in at higher player counts. Game gets much more interesting when playing a series of races as a tour/grand tour, managing exhaustion across races and trying to not fall too far behind on time. A key skill in the game is assessing a given course and knowing when is the best moment to pull ahead of the pack. Overall, this is an excellent, little tactical race game.

2 complaints:
* Not sure why the riders and bikes are separate plastic minis. Just makes moving the pieces more difficult
* A bit too much shuffling for the footprint of the game. I'd like to try this using a bag and poker chips.

Feels a lot like En Garde - simulating a sport through elegantly few rules, in a bluffing game with a bunch of numbered cards that move you along a track. Endgame seemed a little suspicious for being down to the luck of the draw, but I suspect the maths are there to ensure that an exhaustion-free run lets you end on the card of your choice.

After one play, I found myself ambivalent about whether I would wish to play again.  Decided to sell while interest is high in this game.  I've seen a lot of comparisons to Ave Caesar.  I would still prefer to play Ave Caesar over this game - so I kept the right one!

I do not understand what people see in this game, to me the game is pedestrian, you choose a card from 4 and aim for optimum spaces on hills - and that is it, you either draw the cards to achieve this or you don't.

Interesting little cycling game. Easy rules, still fun to play. Not the best cycling game ever (Breaking Away is the best), but goes to top-3. Otherwise great components, but the cyclist miniatures looks too same - it's hard to recognice, which one is sprinter and which one is roulier. We'll see in the future if this is 7 or something else.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was quite the fun racing game where unlike other racing games you can actually go through other people as long as you end up on an empty space. Any players whose bicyclists have an empty square in front take and exhaustion card which can mess with their deck. The deck doesn't allow for many mistakes so if you get shorted movement spaces due to blocking, it could hurt in the end. Probably will look to acquire.

I am very partial to race games, and I am even more partial to race games that have simple, fast, streamlined rules. Flamme Rouge is right up my alley in that regard. Not very much to this game, but what it does do is a really great simulation of bicycle racing. I have played a few bicycle racing games and none of them have every quite captured the feel of the pelaton quite like FR manages to. There aren't that many strategies you can employ in the game, but I guess that is quite like racing in general. Go the fastest without tiring yourself out too much. A really fun game, and I will definitely be picking up a copy.

Sehr geiles Rennspiel mit einem kleinen Deckbaumechanismus drin.
Jeder Spieler hat zwei Radfahrer mit unterschiedlichen Decks. Alle Spieler wählen gleichzeitig aus vier Karten zuerst was ein Fahrer tut, danach nimmt er vier Karten des anderen Fahrers, die restlichen 3 Karten kommen jeweils auf einen Ablagestapel. Alle gewählten Karten werden aufgedeckt und beginnend beim Führenden ziehen die Radler vor, je nach Wert der Karte. Alle gewählten Karten kommen dann aus dem Deck, also sollte man seine drei 9er, die man hat nicht am Anfang verschwenden, die könnte man am Ende brauchen. Ausserdem erhalten am Ende des Zuges jeder Radler, der nicht im Windschatten eines Anderen fährt eine Strafkarte (Wert 2) in sein Deck hinein.
Es gibt noch 2-3 weitere kleinere Regeln, aber im Groben ist es das und es macht super viel Spaß.

Self Created - Prototyp + bought in Essen with signature (Thanks for the short conversation) 

Played 4 times against the AI. It worked fine. I have an Idea how to create different solo variants (incl. exhausting cards, against 3 AIs etc.)

Played 3 times against my SO. She had a good time and enjoyed it! 
That's all I need to know before going to Essen :D
Edit after Essen: now its better to play with the small miniatures and to race on a beautiful track. 

Played once with 4. Very different decisions and made some wrong decision and I finished last... I prefer both player counts (2&4).

A very fast and light (but with interesting decisions) game. It is a great tactical race with 2 player and with more player you have to be more cautious! Especially near mountains. But with 2 it's much  better than expected!! Great.

Unless playing with people who have never played modern board games before I would play this not on the beginner track. The uphill and downhill sections add a lot of planning to the game without much complexity.

This is a fairly simple game, but captures the theme fairly well, and the purposeful falling behind a little bit to slip stream other players and not take exhaustion, or to just burst way into the lead so the other players can't take advantage of you in that way adds a good amount of interaction. Where the up/down slopes are to each other really matter in timing when to play what card. This adds a lot of replayability for me because randomizing the map requires to approach each game a little bit differently, although if you don't like the push and pull decisions of management of your locatons in the pack and how it interacts with your long term plan of how to best utilize the terrain you may find this game repetitive.

I'm not sure if I would categorize it as a deckbuilder. It definitely didn't seem like it when I first read the rules since you only use each card once, but through my plays I realized you are kind of "building" what movement options you have for future turns.

I definitely like this more with 4 than with 3, but enjoy it at both player counts. When the road is too open it makes it difficult to interact via slip streaming and  pack crowding.

Ce jeu de course cycliste simule plutôt ce type événement sportif. On s'y croirait.

Very light, but surprisingly strategic race to the finish with a really unique and theme serving "drafting" mechanic.  You'll be doing an awful lot of shuffling throughout the game, which is a bit fiddly and could have been much better implemented through a sort of bingo-chit randomisation device, I can still appreciate the quality of the board pieces, which look really great on the table.

Highly recommended!  The one racing game to have in a collection.  Kudos to Asger for this gem.  I would not be surprised to see it become a classic and win some awards.  I am not a fan of cycling, yet I feel like I am in a cycling race every time -- the game mechanics capture the feel of the theme, hence the game succeeds both as an abstract racing game and as a simulation of a cycling race.  Great components (heavy cardboard stock, miniatures) and loving attention to details.  Good artistic direction, the type I like the most (like a good French/Belgian BD).  Easy to teach, hard to master -- I feel like I just scratched the surface even after many plays with different groups, and am eager to play it more.  The biggest endorsement is that it leaves you wanting to play it again and introduce more players to it -- great gateway game but also great game to introduce to your gamer friends.  This game plays best in four, in fact I would say that it is meant to be played in 4 (but can also be played at lower counts).  Best to always introduce it a new group with the basic track to have them understand the timing mechanism before dealing with the hills.

Great game! Fun, lite and quick. It's one of those that you want to play again right away. I didn't realize just how much different the game could be when adding hills. I'm looking forward to playing different tracks. 

A touch of luck, but with 4 cards to choose from you "usually" have decent choices. I am not typically a fan of racing games but this one I am a fan, and would even consider owning. Looking forward to MANY more plays!!!

RATING: 8
I'm 4 plays in (0-4 against my husband) and I'm hooked!  

Now, don't let my cycling microbadge fool you.  I don't know the first thing about racing.  I just love to ride my bike as much as possible.  Doesn't matter here since I think anybody can understand that drafting is good and leading the pack can wear you out.

Don't go into this game expecting a deep experience.  This game is purely tactical and very quick to play.  That doesn't mean you won't be making important decisions.  You'll spend your turns trying a find to make your pair of riders work well together, while trying to predict what your opponents will do and when they might try to break away. 

The hills add a lot to the game.  From game one (which was default flat race) to game two (added in hills), we started playing with much more deliberation.  I think this game benefits from a couple of back to back plays to get a better feel for what it's trying to do.  

There are a few minor complaints.  The riders are a little hard to tell apart, you will be shuffling often, and it can be hard to get into the routine of removing your used cards from the game instead of putting them into your discard pile.  

This is a racing game that is distilled down to the basics.  Timing and position are very important and what you'll be focusing on the most in this game.  You're not bogged rules so you just feel the adrenaline from the race, especially the closer you are to the finish line.

There are a few great racing games out there in the gaming world now - and this one is the best for me. Anyone can play and enjoy this I reckon. Takes 2 minutes to teach, loads of variability and so thematic. The addition of the App and the wonderful solo mode and grand tour options makes a great game become an epic game. Loads of fun as solo or multiplayer - and the character cards and fan variants mix it up even more. And the Peloton expansion offers even more. Amazing.

Flamme Rouge is a fast, simple racing game which gives each player much to think about as they navigate their two cyclists down a course. Mountains and slipstreaming are important considerations, along with getting exhausted if you're giving it too much. The clever drafting mechanic is fun and inevitably will fill you with regret as the race comes near its tight finish.

[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  I feel the theme is #1 in this game.  Each session I've played thus far has felt like a real bike race.  There is drama with lead changes and breakaways.  There is stability with a peloton, where riders move in and out along the course.  And there is excitement as the finish line approaches and riders make a final dash for the win, while fighting off the exhaustion they've gained from the race up to that point.

[b]+[/b]  The game is really a hand management game, and I feel it does something interesting with it.  Each player controls a team of two riders.  Each rider has their own deck of cards with different movement values.  Cards are only played once and then removed from the game.  So while everyone has the same two decks of cards for their team, in what order they are drawn (you draw four, pick one each turn) and when you use them will vary between players.  This will be affected by the course itself (where your rider is compared to hills) as well as to other riders on the course (you might gain "free" movement through slipstreaming).  You can only look at the cards of a rider one at a time, but you can decide which to look at first.  It isn't always the same reason for choosing each turn, either.

[b]+[/b]  The presentation of the game is excellent.  The quality and thickness of all the track tiles and player boards are really nice.  The artwork is "old timey" with a feel of the earlier 20th Century.  It has a really neat charm to it.  

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  Like a lot of "negatives" on this geeklist, I don't know if this is really a negative or more a neutral...the AI system.  It's completely random.  You just shuffle each rider's deck of cards and draw one at a time to play.  That's it.  It's very similar to Baseball Highlights in that manner.  And yet....it works pretty well.  Playing the AI teams this way is simple to manage.  There is no rules overhead.  No exceptions (other than they do not take exhaustion cards).  No real effort to play them, which I like.

However, the riders of an AI team do not work like a team; they are independent of each other and act as such.  To reduce the randomness of this, I've been playing where one AI team uses those rules, but the other AI team uses a fan made variant, the peloton team.  This AI team is very similar, drawing a single card each turn, but both riders use the same deck of cards.  This allows them to ride together much of the game, acting like a real team.  There are two additional cards in that deck which will trigger a breakaway for one of the riders, and this adds excitement to their steady-as-she-goes approach.  I will always use this variant when playing solo.

[b]-[/b]  I don't know that there are many different strategies you can employ to be successful in this game.  I won my first two plays before changing one of the AI teams to that peloton variant.  Then a I lost a couple.  But I won my most recent play, and I'm not sure how much I would want to alter my overall decisions from that success too much in future plays.  Obviously, I'll have to keep playing to decide that for certain, but there are a few key strategies that seem like a no-brainer to me.  This is why I want to try the Grand Tour, as you keep stats from one race to the next over six races.  I'd like to see how well I can do when some stuff carries through from one play to the next.

[b]-[/b]   This is nitpicking, but it annoys me that the AI riders can run out of cards before the race ends.  This is usually at the very end when only one or two turns remain (but it doesn't always happen).  So you have to stop the race and reshuffle those decks.  I've decided to just put one "set" of movement cards from the unused team under the standard deck.  This way, if they need an extra card or two to finish the race, they have one of each movement value to draw randomly.  Sometimes they might get a big burst of energy and crush my hopes, maybe they'll hit a slow point in their timing, but mostly, it'll be somewhere in between.  Not that big of a deal, but again, it shows how the AI teams are very random and not racing the "right" way.

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  The game is almost at a family level.  I put this in the neutrals section because I see this as neither good nor bad.  The rules are very easy to learn.  There is not much complexity to the gameplay.  I could definitely see this game being played as a light race game for a family.  There is little negative interaction between the players (once in a while you may be blocked from ending your movement in a track section because two riders are already there).  The game won't be taxing on your brain, but it is definitely not without its decision points.

[b]~[/b]  It's not really a solo game, and I think that comes through in the completely random AI teams.  They aren't playing with any strategy or reasoning at all, but you still need to play within that world.  However, I am having a blast playing this game alone.  Somehow it still works and comes out being an exciting, and realistic feeling, cycling game.  I love how a rider will breakaway from the peloton only to see that group of riders make their way up to him in the next few turns, and even surpass him.  The AI teams don't always play with the best strategy in mind, but they are relentless as they don't need to worry about exhaustion later in the game.

[b]To summarize[/b]:  Overall, this game is a keeper for me right now.  I've played Rallyman many times over the last few years through the monthly challenges in the Guild, and I wasn't sure I needed another race game.  But the two feel very different and offer their own sense of challenge and enjoyment.  Flamme Rouge is lighter game, but I find the hand management aspect very enjoyable as you play to the physical terrain changes of the course as well as to the other riders around you.  Cards can only be used once, so you need to know when to use that powerful breakaway card and when to save it for later.  The exhaustion mechanism is really interesting as well, adding in a sense of realism of leading the charge and bringing in something else for the player to think about when making his choices.  There is already quite a bit of fan made content out there to try, but I'm very curious to see where the designer takes this game with any expansions.  The charm of the game's presentation and the excitement of the race give this game a firm place in my collection.

I have rated more than 650 games, and own a lot of cycling games, but after a couple of games of FR I have to admit: *this is fun*. Not boring fun (as in cube-shoving-fun), but fun-fun, especially when playing more than 2 stages after each other (2 will do) where half the exhaustion cards carry over to the next stage. 

It is amazing: in flat stages the pack tends to stay together (and sprinters win), but add in mountains and you get the whole shabang: break-ways, regrouping, chasse patate etc etc. 
Can you imagine a second stage where a rider manages (or was it accidental?) to break away on the first turn, and manages to WIN!? Only because the group behind refused to set the pace to keep their energy. 

I'm sold!

Great bike race game. For me, this fires Formula D (even though my wife and kids still want to keep it)! Turns are very fast, it feels very thematical. Only downside is the flimsy insert and the cyclists that came loose for one of our teams but apart from that, highly recommended! Don't get why it doesn't get much love from the Dice Tower. I think the video from SU&SD gives a better feeling of the tactical game play. Maybe because cycling isn't that popular in the US? Really very enticing and the vibe of true cycling is really very strong in this one.

Flamme Rouge is an interesting game in that it is both light and approachable for those who don't like convoluted racing games, but it also feels like it needed a little more to think about for me. I tend to not like racing games because they aren't really a genre I like, to begin with, but also some of the rules are very odd depending on the game. Flamme Rouge is very straightforward, which I like, but I really feel like it needs something else to make it stand out from the crowd.

I'm impressed with the simulation aspects of this racing game, and it's fun from time to time. But it's surely quite lacking in replayability, and there is a lack of any real interactivity, which is key - so I'm led to believe - to real cycling.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Flamme Rouge, along with the very family friendly [thing=217176][/thing], have become my two favorite racing games. As I said a year ago, Flamme Rouge has an intuitive ruleset which makes the game a breeze to teach and play. The designer has also done a great job of immersing you in the theme, the mechanics align perfectly with the bicycle race theme. 

I look forward to more plays, but unfortunately my son isn't a huge fan of racing games and I think Flamme Rouge is at it's best with four. In fact, as of now I wouldn't recommend this game unless you will have the opportunity to play with four players more often than not; the more bicycles on the course the better. I would still recommend Flamme Rouge to anyone interested in a family weight racing game and it will be sticking around in our collection, especially with the upcoming release of an expansion*.[/i]

[i]*I will note that while at first I had very little interest in [thing=229941]the Peloton expansion[/thing], but after reading the [blogpost=69942]designer diary[/blogpost] and realizing there will be the option of adding dummy teams to the race I am intrigued. After reading the rules to the expansion, the added dummy players seem like they will make lower player count games much more fun and challenging without too much upkeep on the player's part.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I took a flier on this after hearing about it post Essen. I've been looking for a race game to play with my wife and kids for a while. We tried Thunder Ally and it while fun, wasn't a hit with everyone due in part to TA not being very intuitive and also quite long. I had been eyeing Snow Tails for quite a while, but never pulled the trigger because while it wasn't a heavy game I was looking for something more streamlined. After reading about Flamme Rouge after Essen I decided to pick u a copy and is exactly what I was looking for. 

This is a very light racing game, that is easy to learn with a very intuitive rule set. Since the game play is so straight forward you can really focus on the race and not worrying about a whole subset of rules for movement (aka my main problem with Thunder Ally). The card play mechanic is perfect, everyone has the same movement cards for their riders, but as they are played they are permanently removed form the game with 2 movement exhaustion cards being the only new cards you can get (and they are not good) so you are constantly deciding when to make that push and when to sit back and burn those low cards. 

There is a surprising amount of depth when compared to the simplicity of the rules. Hopefully Flamme Rouge will see US distribution, I can see a lot of gamers who enjoy 45 to 60 minute light/gateway type games really digging this one. I highly recommend it for families; so far my kids love it but my wife needs a bit more convincing (but she has agreed to play some more and after a second play enjoyed it a bit more).[/i]

This beautiful game has elegant and simple rules (deck-building combined with slipstreaming), it is fast-paced and quite enjoyable. It lacks strategic depth and a true cycling race-feeling due to the reduced number of riders (all player controlled; so no pack). Suitable for children, families, non-gamers and cycling fans.

It's a nice light game with a fair bit of variety in the track layouts, I just don't feel like there's many interesting decisions to go into the card you play.
The hills were a nice addition, but even then it feels like gain a tiredness card going uphill only to use it downhill as a 5

I have quite high demands on racing games, since the goal of such games are very narrow, they tend to be the same every time. 

Before I found this I used to say there are only two good racing games; Formula Dé, and a game a friend of min have not yet published: "Keep Betting", but that's ok, because you don't need more. Now I say there are three. 

We have played this a lot and it's still fun. I like totally random tracks, they create fun situations with for example one square downhill between two long stretches of uphill, and that creates more difficult strategic decisions.

Flamme Rouge is a simple bicycle racing game that uses deck management in a way that's not quite deckbuilding.  Each bicycle draws four cards from their deck and picks one to use and move that many spaces.  That card goes out of the game, and the other cards get shuffled back in once the deck runs out.  The trick is, if a bicycle ends a turn at the front of a group of racers, you also get an "exertion" card in your discard, valued at only a 2.  So if you spend your time leading the pack, you'll end up with a deck full of 2's instead of higher values.  Players control two bicycles each, a roller and a sprinter, each with a different card distribution.  There are also hills, that reduce cards to 5 on upslopes and increase cards to 5 on downslopes.  This is a very simple game, but it uses mechanisms that I haven't seen before, and does a pretty good job of keeping players engaged.

The mechanics are very thematic: unbuilding your deck simulating your cyclists getting tired, taking advantage of the pack and the slipstream, etc. Gameplay itself is very easy and fast. The game includes different scenarios and advanced rules. The track pieces are a bit bland, but the rider-pieces are great. So it has a lot going for it, but not enough make it stand out among other racing games.

I own and have many plays of Leader 1, Ave Caesar, Hell of the North and Um Refeinbreite. I watched Tom Vassel's review on Dice Tower and as soon as he described the mechanics, I knew that it would work well. I feel like Tom is missing something. 

My kids took to this game immediately, whereas they refuse to play Leader 1 with me after a first play. I think Flamme Rouge has the best version of the slipstream mechanic and the best version of the energy mechanic. The teamwork element is very well done. You can have a plan to work together, but depending on your choice from 4 cards, your second rider may not have what he needs to match your first riders performance. And for whatever reason, trying to stay in a breakaway is much more challenging and satisfying in this game than any of the others. The amount or riders and the amount of track seems just perfect as well.

I don't like Ave Caesar that much because it is perhaps too simple. Leader 1 can end up with severe clogging issues with too many riders on too little track. Um Refienbreite has perhaps too much track and it can be hard to catch an early effective breakaway. Flamme Rouge seems to hit a very sweet spot between Ave Caesar and the others. I look forward to trying a Grand Tour.

I have to begin this by saying: What a really great game.

Simple enough to teach, incredible integration of mechanics and theme, you actually feel that you are racing on bikes. It was really impressive.

I actually stopped playing because I played too much in a month and felt I was going to get bored of it if I kept playing it at that rate. Both avid boardgamers and casual ones will enjoy it.

it has a Dominion like card dynamic but each time you use a card, it is gone, so you really really have to make the most of each hand you get.

Really great game.

Good reports from geekbuddies had put this on my radar and I was impressed with the designer's 13 Days too. I played it every week in April and was really impressed by the way the dynamics of a cycle race emerge naturally from a pleasingly simple set of rules. 

The basic framework is that each rider has its own deck of 15 number cards (values 3-9). Each turn you draw the top 4, choose one to play and put the rest on the bottom. Played cards never come back to your deck again. Starting from the furthest forward, each rider moves the number of spaces shown on their card. Repeat until a rider crosses the finish!

Of course, there are a few subtleties...

1. Each player controls 2 riders, a sprinter and a rouleur, with different deck composition. The rouleur is a steady mover (3-7) while the sprinter has more extreme cards (2-5 and 9).

2. There's a nice 'slipstream' mechanism - if a rider has a gap of exactly one space between it and the next rider in front, the back rider moves forward to occupy that space. This can 'chain', e.g. if the situation is X-X-X (front) then after slipstreaming it becomes --XXX. 

3. This is especially important because after slipstreaming, any rider without a rider in front of it gets 'exhausted' - a card with a value of 2 is placed on the bottom of the rider's deck. This starts to restrict choices as the game goes on.

4. The track is only 2 lanes wide, and if both spaces where a rider would end up are occupied, the rider stops short (but you can pass through a doubly-occupied space). 

5. You can optionally add hill terrain to the modular track. In uphill sections, maximum movement is 5 (even if you play a higher card) and there is no slipstreaming. In downhill sections, minimum movement is 5 (even if you play a lower card). 

That's pretty much a complete description of the rules. But what emerges from them includes...

- teamwork between your riders to protect each other from exhaustion or (even better) provide slipstreaming

- trying to predict the other players' riders to draft off them too or to block them at crucial points (e.g. top of a hill)

- 'breakaways' where a rider or group of riders tries to get so far ahead of the peloton that it can't draft off them

- timing when to use your big cards and how the terrain affects that; also how to manage mounting exhaustion.

It's quite a subtle game. Even after a few plays, you may not be quite sure why you won or lost as it can come down to fine margins. Players all start with the same decks, so winning and losing will come down to a few spaces picked up from slipstreaming or lost to blocking. It's not a game where the important moments are really obvious at the time.

A charming family-level game that simulates a bicycle race. Each player controls two riders: a sprinter and a roller. Players draw 4 cards and play one of them each turn to determine movement. Most of this game is about staying with the pack and drafting to get free movement. Taking fatigue and being blocked sometimes throw a wrench into things. Players need to stay with the pack and then time their breakaway to sprint to the finish. Hills also throw a curve ball at the players by adding additional rules. All in all, a fantastic game in a 30-45 minute package.

This was a fine light game. Very easy to learn. But my main complaints with it are as follows: 

--There is a lot of fiddly shuffling and moving bits about for the very few actual decisions being made. I think I had to shuffle decks 30+ times during the 30 minute game. 

--The miniatures come apart into two pieces for some reason that I can't understand, which made moving them about more annoying that it should have been. 

--Due to slipstream movement and the exhaustion mechanic, it made sure that everyone more or less has to stay together in a pack throughout the race. 

--Finally, the game felt fairly shallow in terms of depth. I'm ill convinced anyone could be considered a Flamme Rouge expert who would consistently beat other experienced players. I prefer games to have a bit more meaningful decisions than this one seems to have. 


Essentially Flamme Rouge got really interesting and exciting during the last 1/4 of the race when people were right near the finish line and there was some tension about who was going to win and a bit of excitement around jockeying for the lead. Up to that point the game was a tedious mess of choosing cards, constantly shuffling, dealing with miniatures that didn't want to stay together, and ultimately all stuck in a pack together making most decisions feel pretty meaningless.

Feb 2017: I really don't like race games.

Excellent theme integration considering how minimalist this game is.

Go straight to the advanced rules; they add only three to the game!

My issue, though, is it's really, really fiddly considering how light it is. It uses the Dominion mechanic: players draw four cards from their personal deck, play one, then discard the rest. The issue here is that your deck is only 15 cards and all cards are single-use, which means you have to shuffle a tiny deck very often. And you have to do this twice as you control two riders, and thus two decks.

Mike Fitzgerald taught this game to my wife and I at a con.  I really enjoyed this game.  I'm a fan of competitive cycling (did triathlons when I was younger) and they definitely captured the theme here!

This game is quick and easy to teach/learn, but there is definitely a lot of strategy.  Just like in real competitive cycling, the first 90% of the race/game is all about positioning yourself in the pack to reserve energy for the sprint at the end.  Then, when the time is right, BOOM!

I'm mystified about why this is so positively reviewed. HOWEVER I've not played the game with the 'hill road sections', which I'm told make it much more interesting. AND I've only played this once.

Without the hills (i.e. on the starter track), it seemed like an hour of almost totally random chance.

The best similar-ish racing game I know is the first edition of Snow Tails, which has an enormously fun, treacherous and intelligent mechanism for trying to control your vehicle (a dog sled). That game would be my recommendation. (Probably don't get the second edition, as I heard it did away with the braking mechanism which was half the fun of it).

If people want a race game where you win by 'slipstreaming' behind others vehicles (as happens in Flamme Rouge) I'd instead choose Thunder Alley, which has more strategy, tactics, fun and mayhem (albeit being much longer). It's great.

If people want a simple game like the core mechanism of Flamme Rouge, where you reveal your face-down cards together to try to sneak ahead, then For Sale does it far more quickly and more rewardingly than Flamme Rouge. Sure, it doesn't have the 'spatial' strategy of Flamme Rouge ... but I didn't see much of that anyway on the basic Flamme Rouge course.

One of my opponents was telling me it's all about carefully choosing your cards based on how your opponents will move. I don't think players have anything NEAR enough information to make clever decisions about that. Instead you merely play faster cards if you're falling behind the group of cyclist playing pieces ... and slower ones if you're in front. Obviously, you also store-up a big card for the final rush to the finishing line etc.

So I'm not saying there's zero strategy. But c'mon ... are people just deluding themselves into thinking they have more control than they do?

The drafting where cyclists get to move up if they only had one empty space between them and the cyclist in front of them. Also, the cyclists out front and doing the real workload will take the exhaustion cards and can really limit the choices they have later in the race. I need to still get in more plays with the uphill/downhill sections.

Fun, fast cycling game.  Simulates the peloton pretty well with a very simple rule set.  The constant shuffling of the cards is a real pain, and I'm planning to make my own version with numbered discs in cloth bags.  It still has the fiddly space issues that I have with Leader 1, where if you fall short by one space of exiting the mountains on a turn you're at a big disadvantage. But it's worse here because in Leader 1 you usually have the choice to spend the extra energy to go that 1 extra space, whereas in FR you might just not have the cards.  I'm still in the search of the perfect cycling game, although for myself Tour Cycle Free is it (I just have a hard time getting others to play it with me).  I think I'm going to take some of what I like in FR and apply it to the relative system of Tour Cycle Free, and create the perfect hybrid.

Update: After trying some variants and multiple different tracks, I'm increasing my rating to 10. FR has a lot of depth and really does do a great job of simulating the feeling of a cycle race with a simple rule set and no output randomness. The solo rules are great, and it will hit the table easily with my game group, something I can't say for other cycling games. It deserves an SdJ award.

I love this game! As a big fan of road race cycling, this theme is already enough for me to want to play it. But the game does not only look like a cycling race, it FEELS like a cycling race.

If you have ever watched road race cycling the parallels to the game are very apparent. The breakaway riders trying to steal a victory, but tensing up right before the finishline, only to be overtaken by the powerful sprinters. The teamwork between the two riders of each team, trying to save as much energy as possible in the early part of the stage so they can power through at the right moment. The drafting mechanism just holding the bunch together, and the struggle to get back up if you get dropped behing the bunch. The importance of positioning yourself before the climbs. The theme is just everywhere in this game!

And if you are a fan of road race cycling, then you cannot help creating the narratives of the riders in your head as you see them move forward on the track. The theme is so strong in this game and it only became stronger with the expansion.

But most impressive of all, is the simplicity of the game. It can be taught and learnt in less than five minutes!

Joins the ranks of great, simple card-driven race games, with a few innovations of its own that reflect the cycling theme neatly. Just needs blood-transfusion mini-expansion to bring the Tour to life on your tabletop.

RATING: 7
Der Ausreisser brought a communal deck of cards to a board free cycling simulation in such a random way it foolishly killed the theme.

Umreifenbreite added a nice board, gave each cyclist a couple of guaranteed movement cards for control, but added dice to randomise the whole affair. Fun, but a bit slow and not a great cycling experience.

Leader 1 started to hit the mark for the serious cycling fan, but playing with non cyclist enthusiasts they didn't seem to get the collaboration between teams aspect and focused more on a dry numbers exercise. Energy points are available at any time and you can see and plan exactly how far and fast you can move (give or take a potential energy drink) when riding alone. Climber and sprinter specialists were a great idea, but with a leader thrown in the paper shuffling management became a bit of a chore and made the game feel like something out of the seventies game design school. The peloton movement was a good idea with a bit of uncertainty, but it made the game a bit dull for those just cycling along with the peloton - there's no position within the peloton, and the game slows down as each player in turn is checked to see if they want to break away. With the right crowd it was fun and with the number crunchers it dragged to dullsville. To top it off the gamers really into their cycling split away with their "Leader 2" rules set. A Giro version didn't change much, but added the idea of a characters to bring personality to the cyclists and inject an extra dose of variability in the teams.

Leader 1: Hell of the North improved the production quality (riders in one piece), and added enough bibs and bobs (namely more terrain), to make me replace my Leader 1 copy. Peloton movement was interesting, but fiddly. Essentially it wasn't going to convert any Leader 1 sceptics and bring them to the table. For the adult sized fingers the gamers around here have the riders are tiny, prone to toppling and very fiddly to move, which detracts somewhat from the enjoyment of the game.

Now we have Flame Rouge. Thankfully energy cards make a return and replace the paper and pencil and dice. Movement cards are chosen simultaneously, so with a choice of only four cards per cyclist on a turn that seems to speed up the over thinkers considerably. Movement is dumbed down with the two lane road, but again that speeds up play considerably as the counting obsessed no longer have to calculate routes and apexes, etc. So it's a more boardgames friendly cycling simulation for the masses that does a good job of preserving team strategy, energy conservation, peloton movement and the excitement of a breakaway. It gives the feel of cycling in a fast game package, so it's a winner for me because it'll see the table far more frequently than any of its predecessors.

I'm not a fan of discarding of the cards under the draw deck - we're ditching that and chucking them under the player mat.

The recommended first game setup is rather dull. It's not a very complicated game - throw in a hill in the middle of the course or else you might not get people interested in a second game.

My only gripe is that once again I'm faced with absolutely crap quality plastic cyclist pieces falling apart straight out of the box. How hard is it to mould a single sturdy piece of plastic in the shape of a cyclist? If this is plastic miniatures then give me a damn cube with an "S" and another with an "R" stamped on it - or one with a stripe and one without... whatever, as long as I'm not fiddling around with this plastic garbage. On our first play out of the box (not having packed any quick drying glue in my game bag), playing the game ground to a comical halt on several occasions as riders tumbled off bikes and had to be rebalanced back on bikes time and time again. Not a great first impression for the newbies trying to enjoy the game. I might ditch the game just because of this. I know, many will think this pedantic, but poor quality components just irk me - I'm very disappointed in these. (I suppose I could always pick up a set of 1/87 HO model cyclist on eBay - like they used for Leader 1: Hell of the North - but I'm looking for something better and easier to move around on the board.

FUN ★★★★★
For now it's the game that is the most fun with so few rules! It's very simple to understand and there's a lot of tension during the play, particularly at the end of the stage. A perfect game for a nice evening between friends.

RULES ★★★★★
Easy and clear, nothing to say. I really hope that an expansion will be released to introduce the Grand Tour, more players, more terrain effects and so on.

IMMERSION ★★★★✰
The only drawback is the quality of the miniatures. They are not easy so diffentiate between the rouleur and the sprinter and are not painted. This would add a lot in the immersion. The cards could be easily replaced by tokens in order to avoid constantly reshuffling the desk.

DEPTH ★★★✰✰
Here longer-term competition rules are needed, and 6-8 player extension too.

While the Leader-1 line and its variants combine to make my very favorite game, FR scratches the itch with much less effort. (Oh, and with awesome miniatures!) 

Very light rules that provide meaningful, tactical decisions while abstracting the rolling chess match that is pro cycling, then compressing it into a 20-30 minute adrenaline rush. 

Well done.  This is a classic.

Wifey approved.

Great little race game, where you control two riders. One sprinter and a more all rouder. You get a hand of cards for both cyclists and play one card per round. Always good to be just behind the leader as gives you the chance to slip stream and doesn't tire you rider.

Still not sure how much is related to pure luck of the draw and how much is strategy, at a critical point I drew four 2's when I really hadn't been collecting an unusual amount of 2's and it may have cost me the game... and meanwhile my other rider got caught catching 2's and fell hopelessly behind with no chance of catching up, a negative engine-builder that just seems to spiral out of control. Still, though, fun game and plays about the right length.

Wow. NH2045 style it abstracts a sport but gives a strong sense of the spills and thrills  without getting bogged down in detail. Sport is poorly represented in cardboard when it requires too much analysis - Flamme Rouge has such a thin and clean rule set all the gamer is focusing  on is optimizing hand and second guessing what the opposition are going to play.  There are subtle but important differences between the riders and hoe to approach the different courses. Production could have been improved as the two riders not so easy to tell apart. A breath of fresh air and my favorite cycling game.

RATING: 6
Very clever cycling-themed deck-management game. Each player has two cyclists with different distributions of cards (one has an even distribution of 3x cards 3-7 while the other is either slow or very fast (3x 2-5, 9). Cards are selected simultaneously and figures move, starting with the front of the pack.

The game is in the implementation of the peleton. On the flat or downhill, riders only one space behind the next cyclist will automatically catch up. After this occurs, any rider with no-one in front gets an exhaustion card (distance 2) which will be shuffled into their deck. Played cards are removed from the game, so aggressive riders rapidly end up with very poor decks.

The game works very well both thematically and mechanically, but it sometimes suffers from the lack of control. Success depends on successfully judging what multiple players will choose to do -- with sometimes significant input from what they draw. It is perhaps a hair too long for what it is. The length is necessary for the deckbuilding strategy to really come into play, but it's too much to be a filler.

Great fun racing game with some clever ideas, but keeps it simple. The tension can be huge and there is room for tactical play with blocking and timing the final sprint is essential. The hills add some welcome variety. Top notch. The more I play this the more I admire the joy in the simplicity of it. It feels like a real bike race (well, it feels like the bike racing I sit in my comfy chair and watch on the telly. I'm too lazy to pedal, so I ride a motorbike) and it is oh so much fun, and tense. Great with the companion app as well when racing stages.

I LOVE this game! This to me is the BEST entry level race game possible. Quick, clever, almost a 'bluff' your neighbour approach and try to outwit them by blocking or drafting, and perfect game length! Is it the "Best" race game of all time? No, but it plays so quick, hardly any rules, and I've NEVER suffered from the runaway lead that some people have claimed. IF you even remotely like race games, GET IT!

Solid racing game that captures the theme well. I really like that the deck gets cluttered through exhaustion and that you can (sort of) recuperate when going downhill. The only weakness is that the numbers span so far that it is hard to estimate what other players will do on their turn, the result is a tad too much randomness. But despite that I feel that the rating may still go up with more play.

I've been looking for a fun racing game for some time and Flamme Rouge just might be it. The 1930s Parisian racing theme is unique and the one-way deckbuilding adds some interesting strategy. The game is tuned to be very tight. You have a little more movement in your deck than you need to get you past the finish. Exhaustion will eventually set in and timing hills is paramount to a successful race.

I look forward to seeing how the different maps play and how much flexibility there is in creating your own tracks.

Race games are a genre I'm drawn to in theory, but in practice it's very difficult to strike the balance between interesting decisions and fast-paced. Flamme Rouge doesn't quite excel at either but nonetheless I thought was cool... I have to give it credit for conveying the theme very well with simple rules, and the 'reverse deck building' totally works. Ultimately it might be too long and involve too much shuffling for the lack of meaningful decisions, but it certainly stacks up well to the rest of the genre.

This design is a master stroke. So simple, so elegant, every turn is nothing more than picking a numbered card for each of your racers and playing it. Each of those simple card plays has a ton of considerations to process. How many of the high numbered cards are left in my deck? Are the player's around me going to play conservative and try to clump up with the pack or be aggressive and try to race out in front? If you guess right, you might get a free ride via the game's simple but fun drafting mechanic. Guess wrong and you can see your deck fill up with low movement exhaustion cards.

Seriously, you can teach this game in two minutes, one if you don't come up for air. Yet I almost guarantee you will still be having fun with it after 50 plays, unlike most games that have this sort of super quick demo hall appeal.

an odd freewheeling slipstream mechanic. Which seems to make breaking away or leaving stragglers almost an impossibility, and therefore a pointless and boring experience from start to finish.

Even with AI Players performing random card draws they can almost always keep up with the best of players.

The track twists and turns (apart from the hills)  have no impact on the race whatsoever.

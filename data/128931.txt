First, what prevents this from being a GREAT game for me:
-the rules are ridiculously fiddly. It'll take about half a game before you have any idea how it all flows together. Once you're beyond that point in time, it'll be smooth sailing.
-theme-wise, Noblemen is a classic Euro with a pasted-on theme. If the theme actually had connection with the mechanics, the rules would make a lot more sense.

Having said that, Noblemen is a surprisingly good game! Very tense, and very balanced. I cannot possibly imagine how there could ever be two games of Noblemen that played the same, due to the very small amount of luck in the game. More importantly there is an utter uncertainty as to how long a round is going to last. This is not a safe game to make assumptions about what your position will be on even your very next turn! There is a definite cutthroat element to the game, but simply being cutthroat will never be enough to win.
Pasted-on theme aside, it really looks nice, too!

In Noblemen we each extend our personal lands and build on them, with a view to earning prestige and victory points.  Quite a nice feature is the Queen's favour. It is earned by building a palace or a new garden.  The player with it earns 1 v.p. at the end of their turn and it's also the trigger for the round of play to move on.  Since the Queen is fickle with her favour, rounds can progress with unexpected speed, catching the unwary out.  Otherwise, this design strikes me as a lot of same old same old that outstays its welcome by a good half hour.

Production quality is decent, though I was slightly alarmed to read a warning about board warping in the rules.  The progressively more noble heads for the player shields are an amusing if over-produced feature.  The artwork is quite appealing.  The rules are decently written, though I found their layout a tad confusing.

*rating based one one play*

This game feels like a lot of disparate gameplay mechanics so far. The direction seems to been actions blending with the theme instead of something that blends together.  A glaring issue I have with the game is that a player can significantly hinder their opportunities to if they do not make certain specific choices at the beginning of the game.That feels like a flaw. There seems to be a good game in here. I may revise after further plays.

Nice and well-balanced strategic game. But I give one point less because of the going of the roundmarker. After each masquerade the pawn goes one field further. Because of that reason mostly there are not enough turns to react on a action. So I would have suggest to do each decade two extra fields, one after each masquerade.

It's an ok typical Eurogame with some interesting mechanics, though I suspect the balance is slightly off and some "paths to victory" are simply more efficient than others (palace > Stonehenge etc.). I dont like the fact that it requires quite some strategic planning, yet the actions available to you can fluctuate wildly. You can get randomly shafted by everybody trying to snatch the queen from each other. I suspect it's better with less than 5 players, so it doesn't scale very well. All in all, not bad, but nothing to write home about either.

2012. 3-5p. 75-120 min. card drafting, tile pl.

Others say: luck of initial deal of 3 cards/tiles can shape the game for you (hope for good ones) per DanF. It's mostly tile-laying. Imagine if S.Feld created Alhambra. Dry and slow on the first play(s) as you figure out the tile placement implications. Feels like a step up from a gateway game.

I'm disappointed that I can no longer be the house of Dudley clan and imagine myself as an Anachronistic version of the R&B character...  For some reason, I tend to play an clout strategy initally, although I suspect lands is really more efficient.

There are some interesting and creative mechanics and play in this game.  Several different paths to victory but efficient play is important.

RATING: 6
First play: thought it was a nice solid game, nothing special but not a bad one.
Second play: thought it was a bit different and was a bit of a hidden gem.
Third play: years later when tastes have changed and game design has progressed. Felt that the tile placement aspect, which is the crux of the game, was abstracted from the theme and seemingly unlinked. Too many times are you left with actions that you can do nothing with and while the turn system is different it is a little chaotic.

It's OK, and I enjoyed playing the game once, but I see a lot to complain about.
A little less randomness would have helped me enjoy this game more. As it is, you're too dependent on the right tile or card draw.
It felt strange that, as the end of the game draws near, once your resource supply has vanished, there's not much left for you to do.
I also found it too repetitive.

First: the game components are very attractive and draw you in.   There are various interesting strategy arcs, and the game is easy to teach.  All pluses; this game should be rated higher than it is.  I think that this one is a victim of the publisher's comparison to Agricola...

I love eurogames, particularly if they offer something new to the genre – this one does, but it sort of fell flat. I did like the tile laying aspect and the amount of spite (because you can place your meeples on other players’ tiles). What I didn’t like was the lack of control about when to do what because of how the queen moves! You simply cannot plan for that if other players constantly grabs the queen and advances the rounds at a quicker pace than you expected. Sure, you can try to calculate and limit your losses, but it’s very hard! 

There is some randomness included in the game regarding the card and tile drawings, but I don’t mind it in this game. However, the game is too long (with 5 players at least) for what it offers in terms of strategic choices and the enjoyment I get of playing this game.

Initial rating after first play. Rating feels a bit generous, to be honest. I'm hoping it gets better on subsequent plays. The building of your area is [i][b]boring[/b][/i]. No difficult or even tactical constraints to work around, like the walls in Alhambra. There are only 4 types of tiles in the game. And you get them by the handful. So it's easy to build exactly how you want. In fact you could literally build the exact same layout every single game if you wanted. Nothing anyone could do to stop you. I'm not sure whether the steal the queen thing is clever, or just annoying. One thing I am sure of is that it shouldn't be a five player game. Besides the chaos of the queen bouncing all over, the round track doesn't scale at all with the number of players, and with players aggressively seeking out the queen, it means there are fewer turns per round, and it didn't feel like enough. Will try again with 3 or 4, but really was underwhelmed. Felt like a game from 10-15 years ago.

First impression: great production value with lots of wood and cardboard pieces, nicely illustrated. Game is much faster and unforgiving than one might expect. Lots of different approaches seem to be possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Noblemen presents itself with a lavish, yet upon closer inspection cheapish-feeling execution: the tiles are utterly smooth and not as vibrant in colour, and the wooden pieces feel very light. I can easily speculate why this path was chosen: the amount of material would make the game prohibitively expensive otherwise.

The game itself is not very interesting. It is private tableau building, a little reminiscent of games like Carcassonne, Glen More, Alhambra, etcetera. The point to realise is that the rules for building have been simplified considerably, resulting in quite a boring and little remarkable affair with few trade offs worth pondering over. At best a player wants to surround areas completely as to obtain many points for a structure should he erect it on such an enclosed space... but this isn't difficult to accomplish. There is a bit of shared limitations and resource use, but not enough to lift the game out of the grey muck in which it was born. The only thing which might be a little interesting is a playing piece known as the Queen which determines in some ways how fast the game is progressing... but as the number of players rises the behaviour of the Queen is completely chaotic and thus not very interesting in a game-technical way.

The result is a forgettable effort which might as well have not been produced at all.

Game ends too quickly... particularly with 5 players. No one was able to complete much of anything. However, there's a "semi-official" variant that gives a couple extra queen-movements during each decade. We're wanting to try that next time.

Other than that, we all enjoyed the game. It's not wildly innovative, but it's clever enough and has a nice feel/ambience to it... snooty, hobnobbing nobles bucking for the best position at the ball, the best countryside and the best noble titles.

Looking forward to playing this again, but it's not quite a "top-tier" game... probably won't make it to 10 plays before moving on.

EDIT: In the BGG forums is a recommended, semi-official variant to give the game a little more time. Simply do not advance the pawn after a Masquerade Ball. This allows for 2 additional queen movements per decade (for a total of 6 additional turns per game). In a 5-player game, this makes a huge difference and allowed time to try to complete your estate and buildings.

A good, solid mid-heavy Euro that's essentially a tile-laying game but offers a variety of ways to score points. There are a lot of moving parts (not to mention a ton of components), but they aren't hard to put together once you get into it. So far there appears to be a very nice balance in terms of deciding which way to go, both short- and long-term.

What wasn't entirely clear until we actually played the game is that this is one of the most vicious, cutthroat Euros out there. The steal-the-Queen mechanic causes opponents to lose turns in an already tight game, and you can't always see it coming. You really have to plan for getting less done than you want to.

Interestingly, the game may actually play more quickly with more players, since there are more opportunities to move the Queen around and thus cancel turns. Once players get the hang of things, the game shouldn't run much more than 90 minutes, even with 5. It's a nicely brisk pace for a game of this depth.

Seems fine, maybe even better than the generic name would imply.  Players vie to get down kingdoms that can be taxed for the income needed to show prestige in court.

Action selection game.  Build a little town w/tiles where the tiles net your resources (more tiles or money) or points.  Build buildings on your tiles for more points.

I thought it was fun, but not sure how much replayability there is.  A lot comes down to whether you get some good cards to kick off the game.  The card that lets you play 3 additional tiles seemed like a good one to begin with.

Update:  Thinking about this some more, I may need to knock down a notch.  It feels like you really can't go into different strategies because you need a little bit of everything.  So if the strategy is to collect everything, there isn't much to differentiate a players.  Still would need to play one more time to prove this.  We have been playing with beginner setups with 3 of each tile...so that is sure to restrict strategies to building everything.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
To begin, this game has lovely components and the box is unusually sturdy. Care in production quality is all very good and appreciated, but still fluff when it comes time to play. Noblemen has an interesting mix of reviews.

When I finally finished a three player run-through of Noblemen, after hours spread over days, I think I liked it, but not without a hitch.
Simply put, I had had an easier time remembering the rules to more complex games. While the iconography began making sense after I got going, there were conditional effects aplenty that routinely sent me back to the rule book.
I have yet to compete against other people, and think they need to be willing to go at least a couple games in a row.

(Incidentally, the player I decided would focus on gardens won, by a pretty wide margin.)﻿

One last note: Noblemen brings to mind The Cones of Dunshire more than anything else I've played. I don't know if that's a bad thing or not!

This is an incredibly well produced game, definitely a 9/10 here.  The artwork is colourful and there are a mass of components including a beautifully crafted Queen piece and some great coloured wooden structures (Palace, Castle, Chapel, Folly)

As for the game itself we have now played it twice and found it somewhat stop-start with constant references to the rules to check card definitions, point awards for the masquerade ball and points for structure scoring etc.

Factor in that there is a score track and a prestige track and structures and land are scored at different points on either track and the game bogs down in a layer of bureaucracy/housekeeping.

I'm sure these would all be learnt in time but new players may well be put off.

Noblemen could be the quintessential JASE. The only reason it isn't is the option to greatly speed up the game by stealing the queen from each other. This adds an interesting dynamic to the game (if several players choose to collaborate) but isn't really central enough to the game to lift it up over its brethren. It also seemed to have a bit of a rich-get-richer issue.

What a bunch of beautiful game pieces! You really can´t complain on the stuff in the box.
Even if the box is heavy the game is itself is not; rather a medium weighted Euro. It seems pleasingly balanced. I did really well in my first game so I am not sure if the game will challenge me on  the long run.
Building your landscape is not that difficult and when you´re running out of tiles or money you easily can get new resources. There is only few interaction (positioning one´s knight in another player´s landscape) or claiming the Queen. There are a lot of small mechanisms to influence the game, only few feel thematicly meaningful embedded. Therefore: it´s a decent design but I am missing something to having a remarkably great gaming experience.

Not bad. The turn-skipping can be brutal though. Try to efficiently build up your own little kingdom out of tiles and buildings, while simultaneously trying to build up prestige for masquerade rounds. If you win the masquerade you'll gain a title with points and building discounts attached. Humorously, this is represented by removing your noble's head and attaching a new one. A nice presentation here, and easy enough to figure out.

This one flew a little under the radar for me, perhaps partly due to the extremely generic title, so I'm glad I ended up playing nonetheless.  It's very euro, but I like that, and then again, there's also a bit of an edge of meanness to it--but not in a bad way.  Players build their own little piece of land by using tiles which get them different things--money, land, prestige--but they do this in order to compete for different titles, which are represented, rather goofily, by heads with increasingly fancy hats which attach to the top of one's player screen, on which the otherwise headless body of an aristocrat is depicted. Obviously.  This silly gimmick is actually part of a pretty clever mechanism whereby players will gain a particular advantage for a short amount of time, but can't maintain it unless they can outcompete their opponents once again.   There are limited resources on the board, but the nastiness in the game comes from two sources--first, stealing the advantage of another player's land (oh, you thought that was yours?) and second, queen-snatching.  Since the queen determines the speed of the game, this can make a big difference in the game, and there is a slight unpredictability to the scoring rounds.  

I found myself becoming more and more engaged with the game as it went on; each move is pretty significant.  This is a clever and well-constructed game that I'd love to play again, and I'd say it deserves more recognition.  (1 play)

Initial rating after one play:

Very good game! It seems complicated and busy at first, but the board and player aids make it very easy to tell what you can do and what you'll get for that. Lots of thinking in a short time without being AP-inducing.

I really like the look over the game overall. I'm a sucker for tile-laying games, and the tiles here, while simple, create a very nice looking estate by the end of the game.

Nice tile laying game. One thing to watch out for is the Titles can be powerful if one player is allowed to keep one of the higher ranked ones during each Masquerade.

RATING: 7.25
Very nice development game, mixing elements of tile-laying, resource management, special abilities, and turn manipulation.  The individual elements are mostly familiar, but are put together in a reasonably fresh way that runs smoothly while keeping the tension high and the competition solid.

For me, the downsides are that it takes a long time to teach as it has many special rules that are easily forgotten, there's a small and unnecessary element of direct attack, and the luck of tile/card draws can be a bit high considering the long length of the game.

Rating after 1 play.
There is a lot going on here and I can see the rating going up after another play or two has allowed me to really grok how it all works together.  I can also see the potential that there are a few strategies to pursue - the success of which might be decided (or foiled) by tile or card draws and I am not confident that this will have the interesting replayability I look for in a game.
Time will tell.
Would play again.

ここ数年多い、「無難にまとまっている」ゲームの一つ……に思える。
そういうことは「グレンモア」「ペルガモン」などの少し安い中箱系が多くやっているので、普通の値段のゲームでは割高感がある気がする(あくまで個人的な意見)。

同種の領地を4つ正方形に配置できると、その種類によって特典がもらえる。
で、他人の完成領地にコマを置くとその特典を奪えるのだが、このシステムがトップ叩きの為だけにある気がしてすっきりしない。
こういうのは、上手くやりくりして先に完成させてアドバンテージを得るところに楽しみがあると思うが、先に完成させると当然奪われる「だけ」なので、頑張る気もおきない。
後半になり、領地が乱立してくると気にならなくなるが。

New players need to be warned that if they run out of ways to draw more tiles along with not playing enough forests, then they will possibly be handcuffed at that point in the game.  

Otherwise, I find this a very interesting game that is different and unique.  My rating could go higher if I see more layers or combinations of strategy, which I suspect there are.

RATING: 6
This is a solid euro with great production values and an excellent rule set.  However, I'd also say that this is very much JASE; the game is even themed about prestige and building your province, blah blah blah.  :-)  There are several different ways to score points so I do think there are several paths to victory.  I'm not sure if I find it funny that one gains "take that" cards by building churches or not...  The game likely centers around pacing and timing when to take the queen which causes rounds to end more quickly and less actions to be available.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is quite a fantastic game.  Very unique tile-placement game with an assortment of other familiar euro mechanisms attached.  Initially, the rules feel a little wonky in learning, but that's mostly because they are just different than the norm.  But after a round, everyone is up and playing and really loves it.  Gorgeous on the table, too!

Nothing particularly innovative here, but it's a good enough mix of existing things. It seems like there are a few different angles you can come at it from, but I can tell you right now, don't put yourself in a position where you don't have any forests, because that way lies heartbreak.

RATING: 6.25
To start, I have to say that the components are beautiful and of high quality... it's a really pretty game.

But for me the game has 2 flaws:

1- Heavily luck dependent with the tiles you draw from the bag and the Scandal cards you get... 
I don't mind a bit of randomness in games but in this one it's too much... I was really hosed for the great majority of the game because I couldn't draw Wood tiles (the ones that allow you to draw more tiles) to save my life... I know I can exchange 2 other tiles and chose 1 tile of my choice but that's so inefficient because on doing that you almost guarantee you'll not be putting the 3 tiles down in a turn...

It was dramatic how slow my game was because I just couldn't draw from the bag Wood tiles...

2- No Catch up mechanic...
This is an engine building game and if you have no engine due to a combination of a poor choice of the 3 tiles you chose at the start of the game (trust me, choose 3 Wood tiles!!) and the worst luck in the world drawing only the tiles you don't need from the bag you know right there and then you have no chance at even coming close to win the game because if even 1 player gets an engine running and you take more than 2 or 3 turns to get your's up to you are pretty much dead in the water...

By the end of the game I was able to score at the level of the other players but that was about 7 scoring rounds too late (the game has 9 rounds where you do some kind of scoring).

So, I like the game, I think it's cleaver and good looking but the amount of randomness in it is too much for me

Weird game, not sure if it's in a good way. A delightfully arch theme doesn't make up for what seemed like stitched-together gameplay. The game itself features a short, upward-building arc -- seemed like suddenly it was harvest phase and the time for engine-building was over. Meanwhile, in between, there were only about 12 at-bats to cobble together some semblance of a plan. It felt random at times, and I left not really wanting to play again.
-------
first thoughts on the day after: there must be something to this game that it repels me so. After perusing other user comments, I have hope that this game is very different from how it lets on at first, one that will reveal its hooks more fully on subsequent plays.

RATING: 7
Fun little building game which plays much faster than you anticipate, due to a mechanic which advances the game a turn. Like most euros there is never enough time to do what you want to do.

There is a small spatial aspect, but it's interaction-less apart from being able to "steal" your opponents' bonuses.

The player screens are a nice idea, although I keep wanting to say "off with his head!" every time I change titles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like how streamlined everything here is (for example, identical production schemes for all resources), how quick the player turns are, and how well the user interface has been implemented.

I'm not quite sure how well early influence leaders can be counterattacked (i.e. whether capturing all their bonus spots and aggressively bouncing the Queen around is enough) but that will probably get clearer after a few more playings.

An elegant Euro I enjoyed playing. Get out as many tiles as you can to your tableau, get money, get more tiles, build buildings on the tiles for VPs. Some tiles give you prestige, in order to score points when the prestige rounds score. Some tiles give you money to build buildings to get you prestige plus VPs at end of round. Some tiles beget more tiles. Buildings might be straight VPs or card-earners and so on. I liked how players can shorten the round by claiming the queen, so there's never quite as many actions as you think there'll be, making each of the three rounds a race to setup and get stuff out asap. And as you can only do one action each turn, and these are pretty straight-forward, turns clip along nicely. The major decision is how to start and develop your engine (money vs prestige vs more tiles) and when and by how much to spread into each other area. Which is influenced of course by what the other players are doing and whether you can beat them in your engine or not, but also by what tiles you get - there's some significant luck there. Anyway, interesting enough for the occasional play, without it being sock-popping enough to beg for instant or constant replay.

I didn't really grok this game the first time through, so this rating is somewhat tentative.  It's not really your standard resource-management euro, it's more of a timing game.  The focus of the game (that is, the main point generator) is the masquerade, so you want to maximize your masquerade points while at the same time controlling how quickly the masquerade happens.  You can do this by stealing the queen token from another player; the interesting thing is, every time someone does this, several turns are skipped and the game accelerates.  It's certainly an interesting concept; I should probably try it again now that I've figured out what's going on here.

Seems like an older title but only 5 years. Finally got around to trying it out. I quite enjoyed it. The round mechanic is interesting and the fight to take control of the queen to speed it up and gain reputation. There is a couple cool mechanics going on here and the game end is totally dependent on the players and what they can accomplish on their turn and if they want to control the queen. Very unique and I hadn't seen anything like it before. Cool game and I plan on hanging on to it.

It's actually quite cutthroat for a Euro, but it doesn't feel cutthroat. I like that.

This game seems like a mish-mash of mechanics from other games.  I likened it to a foppish version of Lancaster.  On multiple occasions, I found myself looking at another player and saying, "yep, that's like in carcassonne."  It's pretty good, though it strikes me as a little predictable, especially at the start.  Also, you kind of know who is going to win about 2/3 of the way in, or at least you definitely know who is NOT going to win.  Not that there is a runaway leader problem - more of a creeping leader.  Not bad and I might play it again, but I certainly won't be buying it.

Another mishmash of typical Eurogame mechanics.  There is nothing original regarding theme or gameplay. Components are good, but the game is simply average.

This is exactly the game you would expect from TMG ; déjà vu mechanics and really lame pasted on theme in a nice little streamlined package.
The game is not groundbreaking, but the gameplay is interesting and it plays fast.  I particularly like the way you can influence the queen to fasten gameplay.

A good, unremarkable (other than in its gorgeous overproduction) medium-weight Euro. The biggest novelty is the timing element: a round ends when the player holding the queen's favour takes their turn, so if players steal the queen token frequently it is possible for a game to end very quickly indeed. There are a variety of different scoring opportunities, competing pressures, and never enough turns.

In short, it's the kind of game I feel bad about not rating higher: the damnation with faint praise of the "solid 7" that you never get off the shelf. It really is good; I just wouldn't miss it if it were gone.

Let us start here by saying I don't think I want to play with five players again. Even with everybody playing quickly, when I knew what my next three or moves would be, it seemed to be more downtime that a game of this lightness merited.

That said, the game itself was quite fun; there aren't enough tile-laying games coming out anymore. I have some minor quibbles about the tie-breaker for the masked ball (it sucks if the player to your left initiates it) and the final three or four turns seemed to just be about buying up bribes. Until they ran out...

I sound more down on the game than I feel. It was fun, played at a nice clip and I wouldn't be upset if I ended up playing this again next week.

Excellent worker placement game with excellent wood components and cardboard. The game is decent fun.

My first play felt slow and dry. The theme on this game will make it a difficult sell on game nights. I enjoyed the complexity, but it did make the game difficult to teach and the nuances were not entirely intuitive so we had to pop back to the rule book quite often.

I might increase my rating after additional plays, but it would depend on my ability to get others to play. 

I will say I think the production on this game was top notch. I love how it's put together: very attractive and very well thought out. Unfotunately, it doesn't fit very well into the box so I had to jettison the insert.

This is a nice euro game. It has some nice mechanisms (variable number of turns), but it fails to deliver a great game. Still very nice game. It is just missing something that I am not sure what to become a great game. Give it a try.

There is a lot going on in this game, and the initial play was a little overwhelming.  But once you know what's going on it all fits together.  I want to play a lot more of this.

Todd taught at Newington, had to have a copy. Great bits and it really plays tight. I want to play this again.

Very well produced game from TMG.  I like that even the game box feels thicker then most.
The game it self is great, a lot to compete for and even works great with the designers 2 person variant.

Another excellent Euro from TMG.  Lots of things going on to consider and plenty of ways to victory.  Nothing groundbreaking in the way of new mechanics.  Excellent production value.

Uninspiring graphics hides a game with many various paths. First play was very interesting. Tile mechanism was appealing. Definitely want more plays to see if this holds its value.

Impulse buy that I'm REALLY happy about. Something about it just works for me. Not everyone in my group agrees so I hope it gets more plays. 

Update: It didn't - sold.

Want to play again, but somehow the game explanation vs fun ratio seems poor.

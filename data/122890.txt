Trading and auction game set in the Tempest universe. The artwork and components are a bit bland considering the theme the game is wrapped in. I would have preferred to have seen wooden components and nice artwork for the boards. 

The game is a solid auction game though that plays well although the ending can seem a bit abrupt.

There are some things about the game that are discusable : for example, I had a contract of Mercury and the only shipment card that became available with mercury on was auctioned in the very first round and I was the very first to bid. I bid high but not high enough. But I don't wanna break down the game because I liked the way of playing.

RATING: 5
As a fan of the Tempest universe, I really wanted to like this game, but nothing can change the fact that this is just a bunch of auctions, held over and over again. The special powers are good, and decisions are not uninteresting, but the game really drags. In our one play, we all wanted it to end because we were frankly sick of holding auctions all the time (especially for goods that, by the end game, no one wanted because they couldn't sell them). 

Another flaw in the game is that players have no control over which goods were going to come out, so depending on your starting contracts/powers, some players could get a very lucrative early-game bonus while others would flounder waiting for something to come out. Sold.

RATING: N/A
One play, not bad - actions are very tight, and scores are likely pretty low (teens) so every point matters. I don't think it totally works, but I enjoy the auction and the money management. Contracts can be dicey, so use the gather information action. Don't over-value security. Also, you pretty much need to max out your workers right away.

RATING: 5
A bit of an odd duck as economic games go.  Money seems to flow pretty free and fast, and is rather easy to get.  So, it turns into a game of buying victory points (which is much simpler and more guaranteed than fulfilling contracts), and hoping to secure goods that match your contracts to gain the extra VPs needed to win.  Just seemed like an odd balance, overall, since it seems like the game wants to be more about fulfilling contracts.

I also dislike once around and closed fist auctions quite a bit, and this game features both, so there's that as well.

Overall, seems like there's quite a bit of potential here; it was just carried out rather oddly, with several other aspects that just feel "off" to me.

I am really enjoying the Tempest series of games, with Dominare being one of my favourite games of recent months. I bought this, learnt it, and got it to the table. It didn't go over too well, but I blame that on my teaching abilities and not the game. I like economic games and this has bidding, buying and selling. I want to do a night of Courtier, followed by Mercante and rounded off with Dominare. A perfect night of gaming.

Very drab looking (and sounding) merchanting game. Players auction goods and then use a worker placement phase to conduct actions (of which one can be to sell goods). Other actions are steal goods, draw (or play) an event card, draw a contract card (worth immediate gold, and VPs if fulfilled), buy VPs, or extra workers.

Player actions determine the pace of the game. Many different types of goods. Allows some tough decision making, but players who require a strong theme will be disappointed. Another one with merchants in the renaissance period, it seems.

Mercante is a truly unique game. The contracts are done in a way I’ve never seen before. The agent/VP market is innovative, the point auction is amazing and I enjoy the asymmetrical start. It’s a vicious and tight game that doesn’t forgive mistakes. The Tempest series has given me some heavy Euros that I shouldn’t like but I actually do.

RATING: 6
Focuses on highly repetitive auctions for resources, then selling for profit on a sliding market.  Taking contracts gives you money and small victory points, but puts you at risk of not fulfilling a contract with a steep victory point penalty.  Limited intrigue allows you to steal an opponent's good that they choose or to screw with market demands (interaction is really quite limited).  There are better auction games out there, like Augsburg (this one is not very crunchy).

One 4p game only

I enjoyed it, although some of the others found it a little slow - it was everyone's first game.

I liked the balance between the need to generate money through buying, storing and selling goods and the need to generate points through fulfilling contracts (which also generate money as this requires you to sell goods) and straight VP purchase.

The event cards shake things up when least expected, sometimes due to other players' plays, other times through the once-per-round random draw from the deck.

You only have a certain number of actions per turn, and there are never enough!

A lot of economic games are dry, but I found this one pretty interactive.

This one almost breaks the money-is-victory rule but is tied so close together to it that I'm willing to give it a pass.

There are simply actions that turn less-than-10 money into 10 money.  Also, contracts... well, contracts you have to complete, or you will owe.  And if you do take care of the contract, it'll give you points... which is really just money you can't reinvest.  Obviously victory points is a sort of 'power' thing and VP buying is putting money in the right hands, that sort of thing.  So maybe contracts are reputation and money can always be turned into power.

The point is, when you're playing, you're trying to get as much money as possible to turn it into points.

I think I need to try a contract-centric strategy next game just to see how well it'll go.  Though my opponents aren't so good at it, anyway.  Contract points would keep the game going while buying VPs pushes the game towards completion.  Perhaps a mixture of the two?  We'll see.  Maybe I'll play a 3er solo game to check the strategies, but auction games are difficult to do that with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A minimum of three players means this can be hard to get on the table. But the game itself is quite interesting. It's interesting in how it handles the first player advantage... stuff like rushing VP is (soft) punished by also adding VP to the upkeep token to be auctioned later on. Which means that players that spent their time doing business are muh more likely to snag these points.

It seems a good game. I haven't been able to make it shine yet (tried a learning game solo. kinda failed) but do think I saw some potential.

Below average auction game. Not bad, but still flawed. Essentially bidding for goods and hoping to sell these for a high price. Fulfilling contracts seems like a risky business. Getting the right goods is not obvious. Much easier to simply buy the victory points. Not convinced.

RATING: 3
Combination of old mechanisms (you have once around auctions, contracts you need sets of goods for and so forth) put together in a less than impressive way: lots of downtime, market mechanism is overly simple and uninteresting, no dramatic arc (do the same thing over and over again in the same way), etc. Nice bits though.

As is, [i]Mercante[/i] is not a very good game.  I think it has the potential to be a good game with some changes that would tighten it up and make it more strategic.  For example:

- Markets should hold fewer goods
- Event cards should be eliminated or at least scaled back
- Contracts should involve much less luck (it felt like drawing for destinations in [i]Ticket to Ride[/i])

A surprisingly fun and engaging game. The mechanics of the auctions means that you really have to size up your opponent and figure out what he is willing to pay for the card he put up for auction. The contracts are also a nice part of the game, since you really need to make a bet on whether a particular resource is going to come up and if you will be able to get it in time for the endgame. The events in the game are the one sore point I have about the game, since it is very costly to use an action to draw from the action deck, instead of buying VP or selling goods, so the cards that end up on the calendar are mostly the ones drawn at random, and thus feels like you have very little control over the market. But apart from that it is a fun game with a lot of difficult decisions to be made, and it does not take overly long to play either.

There have been a few different publishers that have created multiple different games within the same world building setting. AEG has a mileau called Tempest, and each game is wonderfully woven into the setting. Currently there are six games in the series: Love Letter, Courtier, Dominare, Mercante, Canalis, Patronize. Each game's rulebook includes a richly detailed narrative about the Tempest setting and the game you are about to play. In Mercante, players control one of several merchant houses. You assign your agents to purchase goods from arriving ships and sell them in the market when the prices are high, and sometimes influence the market to drive competitor prices lower. You also fulfill contracts, expand your warehouses and seek to protect your holdings while possibly stealing goods from competing merchants.

I have replaced the natural colored wooden cubes used as warehouse markers, with minature wooden crates. And the pale blue workers have been replaced with pale blue "Paul Revere" colonial plastic miniatures. The cardboard currency has been replaced with metal silver and gold coins. And I added five different ships from Pirates of the Spanish Main as markers for each harbor dock. I will take pictures and post them next time we play.

One of those delightful economic games which start off appearing to be a long slog but accelerate into a tense, abrupt and climactic ending. There's no doubting that the designer got the dynamics of this game spot-on, and the brilliant 'countdown' board adds a whole new dimension into the economic calculations.

Elsewhere, a very solid, but slightly luck-driven economy exercise, depending a little too much on 'effect' cards to be taken seriously. The Skulduggery action is a very clever method of creating interaction without it being overtly directed. Not the most common-sense of games at first, but increasingly rewarding as you probe the depths.

The big games of the Tempest-line of AEG didn't get a real good rating at the start, so they weren't relly high on my priority list to play. But as a costumer of mine wanted to try Mercante, I prepared and played this recently. And I must say that I was surprised in a positive way by this game. It's not that hard to explain or grasp, plays rather quick an is tense until the end to determine the winner. It will probably each time depend on details on whom will win.

Auction game with more thematic heft than most. Lots of small randomizers and ways to trim values keep it from being too computational. Need to play aggressive defence in order to keep scores tight. House abilities seem badly imbalanced. One gives you an almost guaranteed 25 gold if you take a couple actions, while another gives you a bonus gold each time you carry out an activity you might do 3-4 times in a game.

There were some enjoyable mechanisms to this auction/worker placement game, but there was also some fairly intrusive randomness and variance in the quality of cards.  Certain starting powers seemed easier to succeed with than others, event cards varied wildly in their impact on the game (and therefore value to draw and play), etc.

It is a very decent game that plays very quick, but will probably get a BGG rating lower than it should have. Why? Because it is a real cutthroat-, unforgiving game, while it is masquerading as a 'nice, friendly' family game by it's components.

So it probably will not get a lot attention from gamers that like Traingames and heavy economic hardhitters (Splottergames come to mind), which would actually like this game. But it will come across a few family-tables, where people will be totally put-off by it's unforgiving mechanics (no money and you're basically sitting duck) and direct confrontational mechanics (one-on-one stealing from one another). 

While I think it is a good game, it will probably not get the attention, nor the patience it deserves. Because only after a few games this game will shine through it's cutting strategic depth. Like a traingame. Or an economic heavyweight. 

Sadly, most gamers will have it wrote off at that point. Because as a family game, it will not get that time.

For trade as my game group doesn't like it. It's not a solo, so I have to let it go :(

The last game in the Tempest series that I hadn't played. I found most other games (except for [thing=129622][/thing]) fine but not exceptional. This game is the market game in the series. And again it is a fine but not an exceptional game. It offers a nice mix of familiar elements with a healthy dose of luck/chaos thrown in. I was slightly put off by the disconnect between doing well and scoring points. If you get unlucky with your draw of contracts, it's hard to score points, even if you are successful at doing all the trading in the game.
But in the end it is a fine game that didn't offer anything that makes this a must have/play

Mercante was the last game we played at SPIEL '12. It's a well produced game, with decent art, and functional graphic design. Sadly the wax seal icons used to designate product types are all the same design, but in different colors, two of those colors are brown, and purple. Good luck trying to see the difference unless you have perfect lighting above the table.

We had a fun time, even though it's always a bit frustrating playing an auction game for the first time, as you don't know the worth of things. It was also odd that the demo team had been instructed to dumb down the game. We started with 3 workers instead of 2, and did not use the families that would give us unique player powers. The demoer should at least have asked if we wanted to full game or not, especially as the full version sounds much more interesting.

The game seems cool, but you must remind yourself that it's a race game. This is just pedal to the medal get as many VP as possible, before the damn thing's over. This could potentially drop to a very poor rating, but I'm still willing to explore it some more.

I think this game is definitely best with three players.

The many variants, and optional rules in the back of the rulebook scare me. That's almost always a sign of a half-baked game in my experience. Speaking of the rulebook, it's atrocious. One of the worst I've come across. It make a rather simple game seem incredibly difficult, and it's worthless both as a teaching tool, and a reference.

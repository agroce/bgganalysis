LIKE: The game is a puzzle of numerous options. I really liked trying to find interesting combos. Light, quick game.

DISLIKE: Turn order is paramount. Grabbing good special powers head of other players can give advantages. Losing a turn is painful, but an interesting balance for those who pursue alternate strategies. Gaining two plague cards from the monster roll is odd. Slightly long setup.

OVERALL: I liked it more than I though I would, but I wonder about replayability. If played enough, the combos become more obvious. I didn't feel much player interaction, which will limit replayability.

Pick up and deliver... Not really my kind of favourite mechanism. :P

RATING: 6
A fairly unique Stefan Feld game, feels like a race to solve the pick and deliver puzzle. Rolling the dice at the end of your turn and the god powers keep the game interesting through the turn cycle. Monster combat is weird and doesn't gel with the rest of the game. Decision making doesn't feel particularly deep or compelling.

Least favourite of Feld's games played to date, removed from collection.

Fun new Feld game.  Lots of dice manipulation and sailing a ship around.  This one bucks his "point-salad" trend for a straight-up racing game.  Quite a lot of setup and rules for a game of this weight, but it was easy to get really into it.  Felt closer to [b]Macao[/b] to me than [b]Burgundy[/b].

RATING: 7
It's pretty fun. No major complaints. Somewhat better with more people, but not extremely so.

I do have some minor complaints though.

Minor complaint 1 is simply the sheer number of icons on everything. And that's largely down to the sheer number of extra rules to the game. It desperately wants to be more than a pick-up and deliver game, but the designer wasn't sure how to do that. From the theme of the game, you would expect our heroes to be mostly fighting monsters and collecting magical items. Instead, our heroes seem to be far more interested in the construction industry than any Ancient Greek fictional character that I can think of.

Despite 'damage' being one of the large subsystems of the game, we rarely accrue any from battle. Instead, we get it from a black die that basically has the thematic explanation of being the black die of damage accrual. When we get damage, it comes in color, and we need to avoid triplets of the same color. Hokaaaaay....

Delivery of statues and delivery of offerings are mutually interchangeable, and yet require different symbology. Hero cards and equipment cards could have easily been merged into one, without any noticeable change in the game.

There's a lot of nonsense around exploring for ideal locations for a shrine, but it's not terribly interesting.

The designer seems to have wanted to make a game that really struck a different cord for each of the different types of heroic deeds. But, outside of the combat one, he largely failed. And, in attempting to force this variety, he has ended up recreating the complexity of a thematic game, while failing to take advantage of the thematics to come up with mechanisms that make sense or are interesting to play through. And, I also must note, none of the most apparent mechanisms are all that interesting in themselves.

Which brings us to minor complaint #2. Ultimately, the fun part of the game only really comes at the end of the game when combinations of equipment cards and god powers allow a player to perform a few cool combos on their turn, to complete and cash in a few different quests all at once. But just as your character has become capable of doing cool things, the game ends.

And from this, I feel like the designer hadn't necessarily intended for the combo-rificness of the game to be the main selling point of the game. I feel like he believed that the combat and the delivery and the exploration were all supposed to be fun and interesting aspects of the game. But they sort of aren't. Even accepting the game as a bunch of mechanisms in a box, and trying to enjoy it on that basis, none of them are that interesting. The combat feels like a simple matter of spending enough favor to power your way through. Optimizing the path that you follow doesn't feel particularly necessary, since there's basically something to do no matter which direction you go. When I explore, either I get to plonk down a wooden house or I get the same sorts of bonuses - favor chits, etc. - as I get doing any other random thing in the game. There's no real surprises when I do it since it's never going to have an amazing nor an awful result.

The end experience is better than the sum of its parts. I enjoy it and hope to play it again many times, to discover some of the other combo-rific paths to victory. But I do feel like the designer didn't put much effort into designing the game, beyond throwing some things together randomly, and just happens to be innately good enough that a few things still worked well enough to pull it back into the black, by the time he'd gotten the box lid slapped on over top.

One play.

Well.. Stefan Feld is best when designing point salads, imho. I liked this, but perhaps a little less than I let on to Jen. Not sure what I'll rate it. 

Let me be clear: Stefan Feld is almost a holy name in this household. Jen's fav is Castles of Burgundy, and I'm a Trajan admirer. We also have Macao, Luna, Bruges, Aquasphere and Bora Bora in the house. All, including Delphi, are worth experiencing. That said, this wouldn't be my "go to" field. 

For me, it's probably my #4 or 5 (wrestling with Bruges for the #4th spot, with Bruges putting up a fight due to the vast range of card possibilities, though everything else is inferior to Delphi). Only Trajan, Macao and Castles beats it (and maybe Bruges). 

Need to try Rialto.

The board seems busy to me. There is a lot of information to absorb. And while the hex map actually allows for easier movement, I find the board state harder to parse than say five tribes because the components were shrunk to keep the board small enough to work with. 

Otherwise it is mechanically a very forgiving pick-up and delivery game that has smooth moving turns and a few rules notes that distinctly help players plan and strategize during other player turns.

I like race games, and this is a fun race game. I don't even mind the pick-up-and-deliver aspect of it (normally something I don't like). Solid game, nice balance of luck and determinism. Quite enjoyed it.

RATING: 7.7
A bit long, fiddly setup and make sure that you have the v2 rule book - there are serious holes in the v1 rule book.

Also it really helps to have an experienced player (or at least someone who has played it before) teach the rules - otherwise it takes a while.

Although that sounds negative, the game play is really very smooth and the decisions sometimes tricky.  I really enjoyed this and look forward to playing it again.

I'm usually not a fan of dice rolling games (My least favorite is Castles of Burgundy) but Oracle of Delphi mitigates a lot of poor luck by requiring players to solve different (colored) objectives, rather than everyone racing for the same goals, meaning that your luck on rolls is not being compared to someone else's as harshly.

Killer theme. Plays fast and smooth. Feels like a nice mix of mechanisms from some of my other favorite Feld games. The race has plenty of tension. We have seen very close finishes so far. Addictive!

Yes, it has a good dose of luck but so does another of my favorite Feld games, Bruges. You can work around the luck with good companion and equipment cards. Using the god bonuses helps, too.  

The art is fantastic as always from Lohausen. Nice, quality components.

RATING: 6
Quite an unusual Feld design, this game earns major props for its quirky design, but is it fun?  Not for me.  Lots of groaning over bad luck rolls, bad card draws, and too much down time, particularly when you lose a turn!  

Curiously, I think Oracle would have been MUCH better (easier to "see" and enjoy the puzzle) if more time had been spent on the graphic design of the board and the way the MANY colored pieces appear on the board.  The "puzzle" should appear MORE tractable to enhance the fun of the game. 

As it is, Oracle looks like a mess and plays like a mess.  Nevertheless, I will admit there is some "Feld fun" in here.  I love that your god tracks can magically move up on other players turns.  Great idea.

Interesting twist for a Stefan Feld game given that this is a race game to 12 objectives instead of just being a point salad games like the usual Felds.

The one major downside I have is the large amount of variance with the monster rolls and also the variance on the types of injuries that you might get.

RATING: 5
Oracle of Delphi is a significant departure from the stereotypical Stephan Feld game. Instead of being a point-salad euro where luck is carefully controlled and abilities are thoughtfully balanced, Oracle of Delphi is a race game with significant luck and player abilities that create asymmetrical play. 

Now to be clear, Oracle of Delphi is not an American-style game. The experience is largely puzzly and contains many of euro elements that fans love. But unlike Bora Bora and Castles of Burgundy, where dice generally focus players and can easily be manipulated with minor penalties, the dice in Oracle of Delphi can be quite limiting and punishing. For instance, tokens can manipulate dice in both directions in Castles of Burgundy but only in one direction in Oracle of Delphi; thus, "correcting" a bad roll can be much more costly. Furthermore, Oracle of Delphi includes push-your-luck mechanics that are largely absent in his other designs. For instance, there is an end-of-round die that can injure players; and while players can reduce the chance of injury, it can never fully go away and if a player accumulates too many injury cards, they will lose their ENTIRE turn, which is 3 or more actions. 

As of right now, the spatial elements and dice manipulation are interesting enough to warrant further plays. But overall, I'm a bit disappointed with the amount of luck and view this title inferior to most of his other games. That being said, I suspect some gamers will find this design refreshing and exhilarating. 

Component wise, there isn't anything spectacular. But the red/pink colors are much too similar and the island tiles do not have iconography to distinguish them. This is not a game you want to play in poor light.

in fact this is a kind of a race game. The goal is to be faster than your opponents. It's more a game of opportunity and optimalisation than a pure strategy game. Everybody is in the race and has a chance towin, that's why this game is nice to play. Real strategic players will not love this game as much as other games of Feld. But they can choose one of his other titles.

A pick up and deliver race game that has you manipulating dice to accomplish twelve goals.

Still, it is an enjoyable and fun game that is not your typical Feld.

RATING: N/A
Oracle of Delphi looks like something a bit different for Feld as it isn't a "point salad" game like so many of his titles. Instead, players are racing to complete 12 tasks and return home. Each player starts with a different special ability to their ship which can be used during the game to make certain things more efficient. Each turn, you roll 3 dice to determine your actions. There are ways to affect the dice and get different actions or to advance gods and receive extra actions. In this way, it feels a lot like a Feld game. You need to fight monsters, pick up and build statues, build shrines and pick up and deliver goods. And, of course, there are "injury cards" which sound like the "punishment markers" in Macao. Feld is always causing us pain in his games. If you suffer enough injuries without healing then you will lose an entire turn and that does hurt. I would play Oracle of Delphi again given the opportunity. It's enjoyable if nothing special and felt as if it could frequently finish so close like many race games. That's partly good, but also a bit of a problem (IMO) if it's always coming to tie-breaking.

Right off the bat, the bad rulebook and overly complicated setup put me in a poor mood to play and enjoy this game. Perceived uninteresting game play just kind of killed it off for me. Rules and component wise I feel that this game was kind of just half assed. Setup is needlessly complicated and random, components are below average, component color choices are poor. It makes me wonder if the designer ever played a finished copy of his game... I'd be interested to try this one again, to see if better storage organization and being familiar with the setup improves my opinion of the game, I don't think my game group is going to cooperate with that though.

Feld never fails to deliver, and this is no exception. It is much different from his other games: not a point salad, but an optimization race. But like in his other games, a randomly-generated decision space still provides for tons of stuff to do on your turn. Decisions are interesting and challenging, but the game feels fairly light and casual (more so than his other designs). 

Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of race games, primarily because it becomes very clear close to the end of the game who is going to win. So the last few turns always seem like a waste of time. This game is no exception, so I will probably never love this some like other Felds. Also, some of the ship powers seem too strong (especially the one that allows all god tracks to begin on space two), but I'll have to play more to see if that's true. Still a fun, surprisingly quick game.

A really meaty optimization game, where players are vying to be the first to complete 12 tasks, mostly of the pick-up and deliver variety. You'll do this by moving your ship around the board to various locales, acquiring cards that boost your abilities, and appeasing gods that will also give you bonus actions to help you on your way.

I thought it was particularly neat to have a game of this sort that doesn't boil down to counting up a bunch of victory points at the end. It's just a flat out race to complete all of the tasks, which I thought was a nice change of pace.

Lots of stuff going on here, as is typical of a Feld game, but it all comes together pretty well. I'd be happy to play this one any time!

The world's most elaborate pick-up and deliver. Gobs o bits create a somewhat painful setup. The game itself has too many bells and whistles for me to keep track of. Companions, bonus cards, wild cards, special power tracks, defense, on-board bonus chits - you have to craft a strategy that uses all of these things in conjunction with the board layout in the most efficient way. I found it tedious.

Interesting take on a Feld. Pick up and deliver is usually not my thing but the decisions in this one are interesting. The randomness can be frustrating for a game of this length and weight, especially a race game. There is also potential for AP and expect some downtime. Since there are not many ways for interaction, there may be a runaway leader issue. With all that said, I still find the game decisions intriguing. I think this is a 3 player game primarily because of downtime and randomness.

RATING: 6
An efficiency racing game where you try to accomplish 4 types of mini tasks like pick up and deliver, exploration etc, sprinkled with a generous helping of luck. The crux of the matter is planning upfront your turn based on your dice inventory, while being as efficient as you possibly can. I am unsure who its audience is, though. The multitude of special abilities and bonuses and the cryptic at times iconography make it largely unsuitable for families, and on the other hand the luck factor is arguably too high for gamers. There seems to be no innovation whatsoever in Delphi, even the central dice allocation mechanism is clever but nothing to write home about. On the positive side there seems to be a lot of setup variability, that results in a different game each time, and there is very limited downtime, due to the possibility of advanced planning during other players' turns. A different Feld, for sure, as there are no points to collect, but not a game I will probably want to play again. 

+ fundamentally a simple game to teach, special tiles and abilities excepted
+ zero downtime and quick turns, with possibility of up front planning
+ all the mechanisms seem to work well
+ solid components and art

= very limited player interaction
= limited, if any, mechanical innovation

- some of the starting powers (+2 movement) seem a bit overpowered
- the rulebook makes the game harder to grasp than it really is

A lot of little rules to keep track off. 
Colourfull but confusing puzzle-setup
Pickup and delivery game in not so strong Greek mythological setting
In 3 of the 4 games we waited for more then an hour and a half until the untouchable leader finished the job. We all cheered when he was ready. That was fine for me in 1974 when all the family played Monopoly, but unacceptable for me in a boardgame in 2017.

As any other rating, this is strictly personal and subjective. Feel free to enjoy this game anyway. I didn't,  but you may be.

Un Feld diferente en cuanto a que no hay puntos de victoria pero tiene sus mecánicas reconocibles. En este juego, gana quien antes consiga las 12 pruebas o tareas de Zeus.
El juego es relativamente fácil aunque se hace larga la explicación y puede abrumar por la cantidad de detallitos y reglas. Pero una vez arrancas, se pilla pronto.
El azar está presente, sobre todo en la lucha con los monstruos, pero ahí entra el sistema típico de Feld para mitigarlo.
El montar, explicar, y recoger el juego, es un poco coñazo; pero al final merece la pena porque te lo pasas muy bien.
Me ha gustado mucho! Es muy entretenido! Dudaba pero al final ha merecido la pena la compra! Gran juego! Muy recomendable!

Players sail around among the Greek islands and try to fulfill a set of objectives and get back as quick as possible to Zeus (the starting tile). Objectives consist of offering a cube of a particular color picked up from island X to a temple of the same color on island Y, erecting statues of a particular color on island F after picking them up on island G, fighting colored monsters on islands A and B and so forth, and building shrines on islands which need to be discovered. The latter islands contain a greek letter which needs to match with the letter on your objective tile.
Each round players have to roll 3 dice, which gives the players 3 colors. With each die the player can perform a host of "colored" actions. One can pay to change the color. Some actions are also color independent. It is also possible to obtain color cards which give you extra actions, as well as special action cards. Each round one also needs to check against one's shield value whether or not one receives a wound card. With 3 wound cards of the same color or 6 in total the player looses a turn.

RATING: 9
3 plays in, and even better than I expected! I love feld, and this is a creative and refreshing implementation of his design style.  The modular board is BIG and beautiful, so colorful and dynamic, gives a sense of a psychedelic Terra Mystica on water. People talk down on pick up and deliver, but seeing the big picture of the setup alongs with the game specific tasks and trying to plan a strong route is really fun. Seeing good routes is not too complicated in and of itself, as the game is very abundant and allows mannny paths, but the color explosion adds a level of overwhelming saturation that needs to also be puzzled out in order to 'see' the strategic layout of the board. Might be a headache to some, I really love it. As I said, the game is very giving, in a fun way, there's always choices, there's always bonuses received for doing everything. Getting favor tokens is easier than getting workers in Castles of burgundy, and have more uses. Don't forget about using them to sail more spaces! You can ramp up your speed and really push the raciness to the forefront. It FEELS like a race, much more than something like instanbul. I'm not a thematic gamer hardly at all, and but so for me this game hits a real sweet spot of bringing adventure and drama into a euro game core. Again the relative ease of acquiring favor tokens makes fighting monsters more exciting than frustrating, and the luck of the roll will usually spread itself amongst the players fairly. The variable ship tiles aren't as strategy defining as in Marco Polo, but they definitely impact play and are a great addition.  

I've found that the game, since it's a pure race, really demands all players being equally invested in playing to their best ability for it to really shine.  Again the vastness of the board and saturation of color can throw players off at the beginning to start off 'running' with a good plan, and that could lead to a runaway leader, though actually i've yet to see it happen. Options are abundant enough and the wound cards well enough designed that avoiding being stalled or making a suboptimal move is hard to avoid for all players.

and again I really love the modular Terra Mystica candyland vibe, with classic wooden euro bits. I love how feld, even as he gets more thematic and modern in his components, still always includes a few classic wooden cubes.  Im probably in the minority there.  

For me as a not often thematic gamer, this game has great levels of drama, moments of excitement and tension, randomness that causes emotion, but done in a euro package that keeps it strategically engaging for us brainburner types. 

If you need total control and it's all about winning, this game might not be for you, but if you want an adventure euro that's more about the journey, under the influence of shifting unpredictable seas, and love color, this game is awesome.

Someone said it in another comment, and i agree. I think if this is played by the correct rules (it seems like alot of people make little but significant mistakes on first plays), it could be one of Feld's most popular, and among his best.

Very much multiplayer solitaire with a too long and complicated setup that doesn't really add much to the game as I saw it.

If there had been more competition for resources it could have been more fun, but since several powers allowed you to jump all over the map it really didn't matter much if someone killed the monster I was after right in front of my eyes. Perhaps after some more plays it comes more tight and competitive but not at first at least.

Not the worst game I have played but somewhat of a disappointment thus the low score.

The Oracle of Delphi is a pick up and deliver race game, a race to achieve 12 victory conditions. Despite this new mechanic (for Feld) it feels like a Feld game, which is a good thing as I LOVE Stefan Feld, he is one of my favourite designers. 

Sadly, for me, it is not one of the designer's best. Despite the innovative victory conditions the gameplay never fired me up as games such as Luna, Bruges, Bora Bora and the other Feld classics do. Another downside is that the game takes a long time to set up. A long time.

It’s a Feld, so by all other relative merits this is a great game. It is just that the man has set his bar very high indeed and for now at least Alexander Pfister has taken his mantle in the King of the complex Euro stakes.

RATING: 8.34
Great atypical Feld's racing game without points, but with pickup and delivery and dice placement mechanic with the dice mitigation options. It has wonderful set of decisions the players are facing with each turn and it offers immersive sandboxy feel of sea exploration. However the significant luck factor tears some of the enjoyment down.

The driving excitement here (and in similar Stefan Feld games) is the constant mini reward system. You are constantly accomplishing tasks that rewards you with micro bonuses, and admittingly this is quite addicting. I think an honest effort went into capturing a theme here, though it is a still fairly pasted on (not an issue to me, but others may gripe on theme pasting). My two main concerns that prevent me from loving and owning the game are: 1) The board is comprised of so many fruit colored bits and color-blind symbols, that the board becomes a mess to ingest. 2) You really don't have to plan very much beyond what is opportunistic to accomplish at the given moment, leaving you with a sense of being lost and a lot of "I guess I'll just do this whatever task next" moments.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] I am really enjoying this game. The theme isn't especially coherent in terms of "who are we and why are we doing this," but there's a thick flavor of Greek mythology that I enjoy, and it does feel like we're heroes, voyaging around in our wooden ships and doing the sort of quests and deeds and adventuring that the heroes of mythology tended to do.

I like the diversity of the stuff you need to accomplish.  There's a little exploration, a little combat, a little pickup-and-deliver.  

The level of planning vs. improvising here works for me.  I feel like I always want to be planning, but more tactically--it's not a game that calls for One Elaborate Master Plan to Rule Them All, because your opportunities are constantly changing.  And the game does a good job of providing some generally useful things you can always do when you can't do what you wanted to do.

There are two aspects of the dice mechanism that I really appreciate, and both contribute to the pacing and flow of the game.  First, the fact that you roll the dice at the end of your turn and those are the dice you'll have for your next turn.  (Not surprisingly, there are also some possible ways to modify your dice.). This keeps the game moving much better than if you rolled the dice at the start of your turn and everyone then had to wait while you thought about your options.  And it gives you something to do while it's not your turn, because you have the information to think about your options.  The actions of other players may change the gamescape in ways that affect you, but not so much so that it's chaotic and planning is futile.  

Secondly, the way you benefit from other players' dice.  This feels like some good luck is always happening to you, and keeps people engaged in each other's turns.  

This game is guilty of some things that are characteristic of contemporary games.  One is the graphics that seek to be language-independent and end up intelligible to no one.  However, although they don't achieve being self-explanatory, the graphics and player aid do succeed in being useful as a reminder once you know what they mean.  

This game also has a lot of moving parts.  And yes, when you open the box, there are a zillion widgets, and it does take a while to explain what they all do.  I can only say in its defense that it wasn't as bad as some, and the payoff in terms of the amount of fun that I had was worth it.  

As you accomplish the various missions, you earn benefits and powers which will help you in getting future stuff done.  And some of those benefits are things like "choose a card from this ever-varying tableau" so you can't definitely predict what they'll be.  So you're always engaging with the puzzle of "I could do A which would help me do B, or I could do B first which would help me do A, so which would be most efficient?"  And it does have some of that feeling that just when you get all leveled up and are really powerful and can do things, the game is drawing to a close.  This is a game that initially may feel rambling and picaresque, but the more you play, the more it'll tighten up.

Pick up and delivery. So try to optimize your route. Something every player does on his own, I missed some interaction. I also think there is too much luck involved.

There's nothing new under the Feldian sun, even though it's clad in a racing toga this time. He's not distributing VPs quite so freely this time, either, but you still need to do everything and then some. Having to spend your few actions as efficiently as possible and having to cope with the generous sprinkling of chance (in your action die rolls, the wound cards, combatting monsters) are very much at odds with each other and make me wonder about the intended audience for this game. In general, though, it's the fairly typical mix of multiplayer solitaire optimization of a small number of actions and being drawn in a dozen directions at once, all with a significant possibility for AP should you be so inclined.

Also: "Forfeit your turn" as punishment? Really? How inspired. That is a new low.

Die typisch Feldschen Ineinandergreifungen, die sich in TRAJAN und BORA BORA als Siegpunktflut äußern, sind hier in einem antikthematischen Wettrennspiel verbaut, bei dem man darauf achten muss, wann man welche der 12 Aufgaben erledigt, die man erledigen muss, um das Spiel zu gewinnen. DELPHI gibt sich Anschein und Struktur eines Optimierspiels mit vielen bekannten verschraubten Mechanismen, in dem man genau überlegt, wann man welche Aufgabe erledigt und möglicherweise dabei auch noch die Gegner ärgert, wird aber durch schöne Zufallselemente zu einem nadelstichartigem, anarchischen Quertreiber, der es zu einem leichten Hybrid macht, das die Zielgruppe gefällig verärgert: Hardcore-Optimierer werden kotzen und Glückspieler überfordert sein. Durch seine Glückskomponente hat das ORAKEL aber auch etwas Ungewohntes im mathematischen Staate Stefan: Verspieltheit. Der deutlich erkennbare Feld-Salat-Stil hat tatsächlich eine charmante Note. Vermutlich unfreiwillig, aber es holt das sehr Durchdachte ins Kinderzimmer, auch wenn es mit Gleichungen tapeziert ist. ORAKEL VON DELPHI ist ein Aufbaumonster, das prima funktioniert in seiner Anarchie. Toll ist auch, wie krass man das Gewässer gestalten kann.

I can appriciate many of the mechanics in this game and the quality of components and design. 
-It is just that it is a racing game where you need to complete 9 things to win. Not even 8 of 9. All 9. I would rather play a point salad or any game that is a bit more open.
-There is alot of pick up and deliver that get quite boring.
- It is easy to see who is winning a few turns ahead, making a part of the game boring. 
- You can be unlucky with your draw of death cards and miss a whole turn. If that happens you are scrued. 
- Almost no interaction. You might have to pick up something a bit further away because someone else took the thing you wanted, but it is not a big deal...and not a fun interaction.
+ You get lots of improvements making you move faster or break almost any rule. In a fun way.

Delphi has a lot of randomness, which you could argue adds to replayability, but I just didn't care for. Specifically, rolling hit points for the monster (granted, a small aspect of the game) as well as the hidden shrine tiles. Damage cards felt like Feld-esque punishers  a la Notre Dame, Aquaspere, Trajan, etc. just for the sake of Feld-esque punishers. However, they never felt truly punishing. And that might be the biggest beef with Delphi: for a breezy game where you're completely focused on what you're doing--there's 0 player interaction, other than the god dice roll at the end of your turn (which actually helps your opponents instead of trips them up!)--I just thought this game has way too many tokens and cards and wooden bits. For a race game, I'd rather play Istanbul, and for a pick up and deliver race game, I'd rather play Akrotiri. At least in both, I can get in my opponents' faces, or at least their way. There's no incentive or option to really do anything like that in Delphi.

The dice were fine, especially because the favors and other rule-breakers allow you to manipulate them to what you may need. I also liked the companion cards and equipment cards for building that chaining engine. The starting boat that gives you the boost on the god track seemed way too overpowered and won Chris R the game.

A very good game by Stefan Feld once again. Unlike his other games, players can't score various victory points in a way they prefer, but have 12 goals to achieve. But there are various different ways how you can achieve those. So this is a clear Feld game once again. On point of critism. Even more than Aqausphere the many colours on the board confuse me a lot. It was a really good idea to create a double sided board with a less colourful side, but even this is straining.

Simple mechanics of dice manipulation and pick-up-and-delivery, turned into a complex game by lots of special effects. It's a race to complete 12 tasks, instead of the typical "point salad" from Feld, but the feeling is the same, with an overwhelming number of things you can do and must evaluate. The gameplay is reasonably engaging, but the multitude of small (and not so small) random elements seems to be at odds with the required mental effort. Also, although the artwork is not too bad, the game looks ugly and visually confusing on the table, with so many different colors and components mixed.

Early rating based on initial impressions. Lots of things going on (like any Feld game) which forces you to plan, prioritise and optimise on every turn. I love the variable setup, which creates a unique landscape for every game and gives it lots of replayability. It's also a great looking game, very colourful with excellent art direction.

Potential cons: lengthy/fiddly setup, although great for replayability, takes forever! Also, the fact that it's a race means that the game ends abruptly when someone completes all their objectives. This kind of just stops everyone else dead in their tracks, which is a bit anti-climatic. If you enjoy games like Manhattan Project and/or Lewis & Clark (like we do) then that won't bother you.

Overall, we liked this a lot and look forward to more plays.

Seems like one of Feld's better productions in recent years. Not too tough to figure out but a lot of translation from hieroglyphics is required. Dice determine what you can do, but you can alter them, somewhat reminiscent of Castles of Burgundy. Actions mainly involve pick up and deliver, and making deliveries allows you to gain special power cards.

Outstanding game!
1) Who doesn't love sailing their ship around a map?
2) The map is super modular, should be fun to cook up crazy designs.
3) The individual player powers all seem equally ridiculous
4) The power ups you get when delivering statues are awesome. The equipment cards you get when defeating monsters are less awesome but still cool.
5) It's a race!

* I predict that if people actually play the game correctly, it will become one of Feld's greatest hits:
1. You may ONLY place your shrines on islands that match your player color. If the island you revealed does not match your player color, you get the consolation prize associated with the symbol on the island.
2. No color can be chosen twice for a certain task. For example, you may never deliver more than one blue statue. You can track this with the hero/demigod/creature cards you gain.
3. Multiple boats can co-exist on the same space.

RATING: 7
The board is a randomized layout of waterways and islands. The islands house the means by which tasks are completed. Players travel the waterways on boats, finding efficient routes for getting their tasks done. Every waterway space is one of six colors, as is every good and statue to be delivered and every monster to be defeated. Every turn, the three dice determine the colors against which each action can be completed. You can use a die to sail up to three squares, but must finish your move on a space of the die's color, for example. If you are next to an island with red and blue monsters, you must use a red or blue die to fight one of them. While the dice can be limiting, you can use favor tokens to adjust them and collecting favor tokens to add to your flexibility is quite important. There are other tracks and bonuses that you can collect through various actions and accomplishments, because, well, this is a Feld game after all - so intertwining mechanisms is a must. Overall, I found the game to be an enjoyable romp - not heavy in any way - but certainly analytical enough.

There are some potential issues, though. Players with AP tendencies can certainly slow it down, but I think that "criticism" can be leveled at virtually all of Feld's games. Even with some mitigations available, it will be too dice-dependent for some. There are no catch-up mechanisms. While I appreciate this in deeply strategic games, in a game like this it usually means you can see the winner a few turns prior to the end with nothing anybody can do about it. Only the last item is of concern to me personally. I can live with it for some plays, but I could see this aspect growing old after a while. It's a game I would place in about the middle of Feld's canon, but I can see how it could swing from the bottom to the top of folks' opinions. This is an atypical Feld and how much you like it will have more to do with your tastes than with your opinion of the designer.

A Feld game with no points. Instead it's a race to accomplish all 12 tasks. The action selection comes from rolling dice, and much like in The Castles of Burgundy the results tell you what particular actions will do, and not which actions you have to choose from. For example with a green die result you can move and end on a green space, or load a green shrine onto your boat, or fight a green monster in an adjacent space. You have some ability to change dice results as well.

The game is very interactive. Players are all acting on the board to accomplish the goals, and while there is enough stuff for everyone to do everything the random board setup will make some goals easier than others. For example you may race off to pick up and deliver a cube that happens to be close to its destination, while the last player to fulfill that task may need to haul a cube from the other side of the map.

There are powerful special actions in the game and technology cards. So if you do need to haul a cube across the map there are ways to plan to do that with less effort. The game is all about action efficiency, you need to convert your actions into completing the tasks before anyone else. Prioritizing goals and planning carefully help, so does assembling the right special actions at the right time.

The game was enjoyable. There is luck, quite obviously, which I think lightens the mood of the game quite a bit. It isn't a serious strategy game, but a fun tactical one which does present interesting choices and optimization problems.

The setup for the game is labor intensive. However it isn't as bad as people have been saying. On a first play it seems intense as you need to methodically go through the steps in the rulebook, but it's actually straightforward and will fly by with all players chipping in.

I think there's too much luck in the game to justify the playtime. There are dice rolls for actions, card draws, dice rolls for monster battle, tile flips, and dice rolls for titan attacks. You can make good decisions but it somehow feels like those are getting drowned out by the noise.

I really like Feld games. Castles of Burgundy and Trajan are among my favorite games. I enjoy most of his games, only a couple of them I consider to be average. The Oracle of Delphi is his first game I actively dislike and wouldn't play again. To be fair, this is an absolutely subjective impression based on my personal enjoyment. Objectively, the game is better than I rate it. The Oracle of Delphi is among the few games where a single annoying experience condemns the game to the exile of boardgames where it joins [gameid=348], [gameid=50750] and [gameid=63628]. Suffer eternal unity with the abysmal incarnations of boardgaming hell such as Risk, abominations!

My frustration can be pinpointed to the shield/monster/plague system that fails in two ways. First, it's entirely possible that a player investing in this system will still fail on monster rolls while another player putting his investment into other systems gets lucky. Second, the whole shield investment can be pointless when the plague rolls and card draws are unlucky, forcing you to lose a turn notwithstanding your effort to avoid this while other players do nothing and get lucky. Lose a turn, really? Isn't it 2016?

I could live with luck-based resolutions in a quicker game or a game with enough luck-based decisions to even out but in a race game where tactical optimization is essential, where turns of a player can take a minute or two, this is a killer. Sitting there two rounds and watching other players pondering their moves is seriously negative fun. Seeing them grab the reward you were set up for before losing your turn or losing your lead, knowing that you'll trail the pack from now on for the remaining hour doesn't help. At least, I have learned that the chances for drawing three times the same plague in a row (out of six different while ignoring that draws aren't put back to the pool) is only 1:36 and not 1:216 as I thought.

A surprisingly engaging race with pick-up-and-deliver elements. Many deliveries will give you upgrades and abilities, all of which feel powerful to some degree. The easiest tasks are taken first by opponents. The winner is the first person to complete all tasks in the fewest turns possible.

I really like the game, but worry that replayability will suffer because there's not much changing from play to play.

much to fiddly for what it does. first setup is roughly 30-45 min., afterwards 15. Then pick-up-and deliver and racing to complete the tasks to honor Zeus. your decisions are somewhat limited by the dice rolls, but somehow you can always manage, we felt it lacked challenge and ways to interact with the other players. Interaction is basically limited to being first somewhere and taking limited resources away from others. The theme and components are really nice, but we asked ourselves if this mass of stuff was really needed for this rather shallow gameplay...

Elég jó kis játék, talán a kellemesnél kicsit több a szabály, de játszva már könnyűnek tűnik. Azt hiszem, ez a leghevibb pick up and deliver, amivel eddig játszottam. A kockás mechanizmus érdekes, elég jól kezelhető, nem merül fel állandóan a szerencse kérdése. Van némi játékosok közötti interakció, nem csak a Catan-szerű "ha mások dobnak, én is figyelek, hátha jól járok" jelleg miatt, de a célok teljesítése miatt jónéhány esetben elhappoljuk egymás elől a könnyebben teljesíthetőket. Nem fájdalmas ez a "kiszúrás", de nem is hagyható figyelmen kívül. Összességében elég egyedi játéknak érzem, de a kipakolás, elpakolás nem a legkellemesebb. Sajnos néha ez is szempont.

At last, again a Feld game that I can quite enjoy. In the past five years I wasn't really impressed by his output as most of his games felt like they were designed by an autopilot instead of him. Bora Bora offered some interesting strategies and a bit of fun by the dice and Aquasphere was not bad, but the only game of the past five years I could enjoy was Amerigo, mostly because I [i]generally[/i] enjoy what I was doing there (also the cube tower was a nice mechanism idea). (I really could not like the rest, however hard I tried.) Maybe it's no wonder that I enjoyed Delphi as well now, as it's once again about moving around islands with our ships on a map randomised with tiles. Also it has a bit of rolling the dice but that does not make it completely random (especially as they can be changed following a kind of rondel for this). Fate cards are also a lot better controllable than those damned small tiles in Bruges. And the 12 tasks offer a somewhat enjoyable variety of pick up and delivery, some exploring and even some light ATish dice fight against monsters. Also individual ship abilities are rather strong which seem to be trending since Marco Polo. And all these serve a racing game. All the things I listed here are more or less to my liking which helps me accept the more boring "complex Eurogamey" stuff as well (moving those gods along an excel sheet - actually important part of the strategy; different helping cards and tiles to be collected). Overall, I liked it.

Moved rating from 6 -> 5

Playing correctly the second time did not improve the game experience. While one could theoretically plan ahead a bit, doing so proves challenging, particularly if someone else swoops in and takes the cube or attacks the monster you were planning to do...which generally means total reset. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I think the game itself is quite interesting although instead of point salad it is action salad. There are a number of different actions one can take in different ways and one is seeking to do so the most efficiently in a race oriented matter. I came back to win my game when everything fell together perfectly in the final turn for me. We did play one aspect incorrectly which initially was  a sour point in the game as there was a fair bit of AP/time but if one plays correctly, it shouldn't be as bad as the dice for the next turn are rolled at the end of your current turn...which we weren't doing. Oops! Some of the boats may feel overpowered, but I expect that with repeat play they will not prove as OP as they appear (IE, the gods track boat - might recommend not playing with that one in your first couple games).

[microbadge=5]

Stefan Feld point salad game, but pretty atypical for the designer.  Rather than just accumulating random points throughout the game, the point salad aspect of the game has been turned into twelve assignments that can be completed in any order.  Finish all twelve and get back to the start space first and you win.  So it's a racing game.  The race adds some good player interaction, as does the common board to deny assignment opportunities to other players. The God powers add some interesting strategies to the whole thing.  The dice mechanic is pretty much straight out of Castles of Burgundy.  Strong twist on a generally one-note mechanic from Feld.

You are trying to complete 12 "labors".  You sail your ship around to move goods to temples, gather other statues for religious sites, find temples matching your color and kill monsters.  The game is abstract and is basically a race game not unsimilar to the "race" in Istanbul. 

The game is AP prone and can run a lot longer than you may want to play.  I generally like Feld but this one fell flat again like Aquasphere.  I would play again, but am not keen to play it.

I love this as a solo game. As a multiplayer game, it's kind of a bear to teach to be honest. That makes it harder for me to bring this out with less experienced people. Otherwise, it's a great race and a nice deviation from the usual Feldian point salad.

A race (no real intereaction) to accomplish a variety of tasks, with abundant luck attached and a variety of special powers to add complexity to a simple game (too convoluted if you want something simple, too bland if you want something deep).

Es sollen drei Kultstätten erbaut, drei Statuen errichtet, drei Opfer gebracht und drei Monster besiegt werden. Mit einem kleinen Holzschiff bereist man den variablen Spielplan und muss Inseln anfahren, um dort die einzelnen Aufgaben zu lösen.
Der Spielmechanismus basiert auf sechs Farben. Zum Beginn jeder Runde hat jeder Spieler bereits drei Farbwürfel vor sich liegen. Alle Aktionen im Spiel sind farbkodiert. Bevor ich irgendetwas in meinem Spielzug mache, muss ich schauen, wie ich meine  Würfel optimal einsetze.
Zeus belohnt uns hin und wieder mit Gunstplättchen. Diese können mannigfaltig eingesetzt werden, z. B. um die Reichweite des Schiffes für einen Zug zu erhöhen. Bei den anderen Göttern muss man erst ordentlich Punkte sammeln, damit sie einen unterstützen.

Pick up and deliver, many things at once. 
Typically a game where you have to study the board very well before you start playing. Complexity for the sake of complexity. I know more enjoyable pick up and deliver games than this one, that have simpler rules, and more theme.

First pick up and deliver game I own. Got caught by it being a Feld game. Among the games I own from him, this is probably my least favorite. 
The components are great, the theme is great, the game play is ok. It tends to be a light game or at least I feel after playing the first two games. It takes some time to get used with the icons and stuff but once you read the rules once or twice, you get the hang of it. 
The best aspect of the game is the rolling dice and then choosing your actions by doing specific things with that color-dice or changing them to do what you need. I also like the little upgrades you can make to the boat, but overall there is not too much depth on gameplay and it's fairly simple.
Downside I can see is when there is a big gap between players, that in the middle of the game someone can be far behind and at that point it probably sucks for them knowing that they have to play 20 - 30 more minutes without a chance to catch up.

Update. Two other things I dislike. Main issue I have is the time it takes to setup the game and the luck factor in the location of the cities or locations you need to go to. The second issue (still minor) is that one of the boats that lets you place all your God tokens above the track seems too powerful compared to the others.

Good puzzle game. Not a point salad but a goal salad instead, it's a race game to complete your goals the first. I like the gods system a lot: you get some moves up in the other players' turn and when a god reaches the top, you can break some rule and possible score some nice combo's. Like it better than Bora Bora and Aquasphere, this is playing smoother with more freedom to do what you want, less bound by limitations as in the fore mentioned games.

This is a terrific game, that feels both new and familiar at the same time. While it still uses dice in a very Feld way, the game is actually a race to the finish line as players work to be the first to finish their 12 divine tasks and get back to Zeus. You have to explore islands to build shrine, deliver tributes, erect statues and fight monsters. You may also worship the various deities in the greek pantheon to call upon their favours.

It's a really exellent and open game, and I cannot wait to take another crack at it.

I'm not generally a fan of race games and that definitely knocks this one down a notch, though I'm not sure this would qualify as a top Feld for me even so. While I like the player and character powers and also the way the dice are used, the game comes together in an unexciting package. And I still can't figure out why all players are chasing the same two colors of monsters and offerings while two-thirds of the board remains under value. A Feld miss for me.

I might need more plays to confirm, but this is a very neat pick-up and deliver game with several pretty clever twists. As usual with Stefan Feld, there are a lot of fiddly mechanisms, but they are all neatly suggested with icons and the whole thing together just... works.
However, sometimes you might have simply bad luck and losing several turns because of it, which, in racing game, is pretty frustrating.

A race game with a hodge-podge of pick-up-and-deliver goals that each player is trying to accomplish first. They do this with dice, and plenty of dice mitigation.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. Oracle of Delphi is both new and familiar territory for Feld, because while it does break new ground with a central pickup-and-deliver mechanism, it feels incredibly derivative of some of his other games...namely Castles of Burgundy and Bora Bora, and not just because they all use dice. 

I liked this game well enough, but I'm starting to feel like Feld doesn't have any fresh ideas left in the tank. Aquasphere felt pretty redundant also, but at least it felt like a more refined version of his past designs. Delphi feels like Castles of Burgundy with all the hairy details of Bora Bora in the mix, without really bringing anything new to the table. Had I not played those games, I may have liked this one more. It just felt a lot more disjointed than those aforementioned games. Plus I'm not really a fan of racing games, and while it was more tolerable here, I did find myself missing the traditional victory point track. Like Aquasphere, Delphi forces you to dabble into everything in order to do well, but the goals are far more strict here in comparison.

I didn't dislike this game, but I was expecting something better than what I got. I've been enjoying pickup-and-deliver games more as of late, and I really liked the powers given by the equipment cards and companions. The rest of the game, however, just felt like a slow, prodding process of moving around a map to fulfill objectives. I'm not quite ready to lower Feld out of my #1 designer spot, but his next game needs to be really out of the norm, in a good way, lest he fall onto the list of the other designers out there who tend to do the same game over and over again (Rosenburg, Leacock, etc).

RATING: 6
Roll and spend dice to travel across a Greek archipelago and complete tasks. Some tasks are predictable (pick a colored item and deliver to a square of the same color) while others are more random (move to and flip the right tile or roll to defeat a monster). I understand that race games need some kind of chaos to remain open and interesting but is randomness the best solution? Still, there are some interesting decisions, such as beating opponents to limited tasks, finding the optimal use of given die rolls and timing of unlocking the different Gods' powers.

If you want to enjoy it, you have to accept that it's random, luck can win or lose a tight game, and that you can pretty much lose your game for good by screwing up on turn two. Yet I really enjoy it. Really hard to rate this game. It's both better and worse than an 8, my standard Feld rating. I love the variable set-up and the spatial element.

Oracle was not a game I expected to like, being it was a pick up and deliver.  But the way the game's mechanisms handle it made me a believer.  The game gives you very specific goals, but lets you handle those goals however you want and in any order you wish.  Not your typical Feld, hope to see more of this from him.

The Oracle Of Delphi is a Pick-up and Deliver game that is essentially a scavenger hunt. You start the game with a series of tasks to complete and race to do so before your opponents. Like his previous title, Castles Of Burgundy, Stefan Feld once again achieves superb dice-driven game design, with tOoD's input based use of D6's.

TOoD's modular board randomizes play experience, extending the game's life. Components are the typical Euro affair, but colorful.

Oracle of Delhpi is a boring pick up and deliver game. It was at least a different experience for a Feld, but the race, plus pick up and deliver aspect felt like once someone is behind they are finished. I'll look elsewhere for board game entertainment.

RATING: 3
Pick up and deliver game with a modular board, with a color scheme (colored action dice, colored cubes and statues to deliver, colored spaces and temples to deliver to, colored monsters to fight with dice), special abilities, punishing cards, helper cards and a race element.  Very complicated for what it is, i have not seen a euro with this many components, and I find the luck element too much for this complexity. Not the best game of Herr Feld

Feld games can be hit (Castles of Burgundy) or miss (Bruges) for me, this one falls somewhat in between. I actually like the race aspect of this and dice manipulation is always something I enjoy and it's solid in this one.

Few Euros get an 8 from me these days, but this was one of them. Lots of things to gather and process to win, lots of ways to go about it. You’re restricted by dice rolls but it has the required Feld dice manipulation tweaks which work nicely and you never felt too badly done by. Lots of tech powers to contemplate, and combos to explore. Turns go fairly smoothly because you can study and plan during other players' turns. I enjoyed it.

The Oracle of Delphi is a game in which you roll some dice and can perform various actions depending on the sides that come up, a little like Castles of Burgundy. However, this game involves sailing around a map board and interacting with various elements, including tiles that need to be discovered, items that need to be picked up and delivered, and monsters to be defeated. There are no victory points--when someone completes all 12 tasks the game is over. Once you get past set-up (which is a real bear), the game is actually quite intuitive and easy to grok. It's definitely not as thinky as other Feld titles, but it does provide a smooth, fun experience.

RATING: 8
Defintely very much in the vein of felds, just without the point salad being thrown in. It's a pick up and deliver game with a bit of randomness, although that can be mitigated through favor tokens or by getting the gods to the top of the track. I like this one quite a bit, but I just worry downtime with 4 players might be a bit of an issue. I do think the titan die at the end of the turn is rather annoying though. I understand it's the only way outside of fighting a monster to get wound cards, but it seems like more of an annoyance than something that really needed to be in there.

We set up the map with the base game rules and we also tried a random configuration. I will say, the randomness of the map makes a huge difference as to how to actually play the game. We had it accidentally set up so that it basically sent you on a giant "u" that you couldn't get back to the other side unless you used a blue god or spend like 2-3 turns just moving your boat. It was weird and fun, but I think it just made the game go longer. Need to play around with the various map set ups to see which style I like best. Would have loved to see some premade setups on the back of the book.

Update: 4 Players went a touch long, but we were talking during and busy doing other things as well. If all the players knew the game, I think 4 would be bested only by 3 players. The jury is still out with 2.

It's not what you (or at least I) would expect from a Feld-game: instead of 200 possibilities to score points where you can pick exactly 2 if you wanna do well, it's  a sort of race and optimization of pick-up-and-delivery. But I guess it's a good thing he tries to make something different each time :-)

New Feld! Not a point salad game but a race game. Trying to complete tasks before everyone else and get to the finish. Love the dice and the goads.

The colors are bold and the game is great.

Thoroughly enjoyed this game. I like how there is no point track, that it is a there-and-back set up. This makes it easier to compare how you are doing versus the other players. There are many tasks to complete but they can be done in any order. My only complaint thus far is it is difficult to distinguish between the pink and red colours on some parts of the game.

Dice manipulation race to pick up and deliver (least favorite mechanic). Med weight, but lots of fiddly bits and mechanics - it feels a bit like 'action'-salad where each turn presents plenty of things to do but lacks much tension in the decisions.
-Play time on the longer end, overstays its welcome

RATING: 5
This is a pickup and deliver game where each turn you roll three dice, and the dice determine your success or failure in terms of being able to make efficient moves. Each round a penalty die is rolled, and if you didn't prepare proper defenses, you take a wound card. Once you have a certain number of those cards, you have to skip a turn which can be harsh. The game has a lot of different ways to mitigate your luck, and some engine building which is nice, but ultimately it's a competent but uninspiring efficiency game.

Components-wise, Red and Pink were printed on the tiles to mark them and the color is wayy too close to each other to be functional. The game has reverse sides on the tiles that emphasize symbol over color, but the rulebook doesn't have a mirrored setup diagram, which is incredibly frustrating.

Good, but not one of my favorite Feld games. Certain specialty powers seem more powerful than others, but what is especially annoying is that you must use Ares to kill monsters.

A bit too light for a huge fan of "Bora Bora" and "Macao" - but still a fun game. For me, it lost the competition with heavier titles (not heavy enough, obviously), but also with the lighter titles I tend to pick when playing with newcomers/fans of more casual gaming. A game like "Isle of Skye" works better in that regard - is faster to set up and has less rules. 

Still, I recommend it if you're looking for a medium to light-ish eurogame with clever dice manipulation. There's quite a lot of replayability here (Feld, duh) and the game's not expensive and well produced. One thumb up, just not for me. Not enough going on, doesn't make my mind spin like some other great Feld titles.

One of the most unique games in Feld's catalog. As a long time Feld fan, I think this a fascinating change in style from his previous titles. There were many naysayers  complaining that "point-salad" style games were not as mechanically coherent or impressive as other games, but I've always felt Trajan was brilliantly executed. Still, for those people, here is Oracle of Delphi, a game with zero points. Instead, players have 12 goals they are racing to accomplish. Each rewards a special upgrade to help launch you towards the next goal. Perhaps, like a point-salad, Delphi still provides a non-linear experience, but the ship travel, god discs, and oracle dice all tie everything together into one cohesive adventure. Because of this, Delphi is perhaps Feld's most thematic game, and I truly feel excited to recruit heroes and slay monsters all over the map. To put it simply, this is far from classic Feld, but bits and pieces of his old designs are recognizable. He clearly still has a great many tricks up his sleeve.

Simple pick up and deliver game with lots of moving parts. The game is a just a bit too random, from the dice to the initial setup.  Speaking of setup, it takes way too long with so many different things to setup.  You are trying to optimize your actions and movements with the dice you rolled.  Not one of Feld's best games but still fun, just make sure someone else does the setup and cleanup for you!

A unique take on a race game. If I’m going for a dice-manipanon Feld, I don’t know why I’d pick this over Castles of Burgundy. This is good, but it’s not better than CoB. 

Also, and I’ll need more games under my belt to figure this out, the luck factor seems higher here. You have a specific set of tasks you have to accomplish, and if you don’t roll as well as others who are trying to accomplish those same tasks, you’ll probably lose. At least in CoB if you don’t roll what you need, you can go after other VP-making option. But here, you’re just delaying doing what you have to do. And people who roll what they need will do better.

Played once with 4P. A mid-tier Feld title with a high rules overhead and labourious setup. It offers something different in being a race to finish all tasks before anyone else. Players start out with a basic unique ability, but will gradually add abilities to their roster which make them efficient in different areas. In the meantime, they have to make the best of what luck deals to them.

The Oracle of Delphi is fairly smooth-sailing, in a sense that you are always limited to working with your dice rolls for that turn. Player interaction is most prominent at the early stages of the game, when players are mapping out their general order of fulfilling tasks and would prefer not to clash on routes. By the endgame, players become 'superpowered' enough to fulfill several tasks in the same turn. Probably the one real downside is that luck can be too influential in a game of this weight – in the one game I played, it came down to the player who managed to reveal his sanctuary correctly.

Feld megint alkotott egy nagyon jól összerakott játékot, de elsőre kicsit soknak éreztem a szerencsefaktort benne. A játékosoknak 4*3 feladatot kell megoldaniuk és akinek ez először sikerül az a győztes. A négy különböző feladat, szentély építés, szállítás, szoborállítás, szörnylegyőzés. Ezekért különböző jutalmakat kapunk, játék közben azonban sérülhetünk is a kör végén vagy a szörnyekkel vívott harcok során, aminek komoly ára van, mert ha kigyűlik hat sérülésünk vagy 3 azonos színű, akkor kimaradunk egy körből. Én ezt nagyon erősnek éreztem, de más azt mondta náluk több játékban is többször maradtak ki egyes játékosok és volt esélyük a győzelemre így is. Vannak különböző típusú bónuszt adó kártyák és istenek, akik az égi trón felé tartanak, ha elérik egy-egy bónuszakciót adnak, amit bármikor felhasználhatunk a későbbiekben. A játékot kockák irányítják, amin 6 szín található, a térképen ezekkel tudunk mozogni, feladatokat is ezek felhasználásával oldunk meg. A játék kulcsa első játékra nekem az isteni ujj volt. Amivel plusz lépéseket, szörnyharcban segítséget, kockák átszínezését végezhetjük. Enélkül eléggé meg van szorítva mit tehetünk. Illetve kulcs még az egyes feladatok megoldásának legjobb helyeinek megtalálása a véletlenszerűen kialakított térképen. Tetszett, jó játék a Delphi és valószínűleg minden parti más.

The race game is much more complex than I initially thought.  There is a lot going on with special powers, dice rolling, movement, combat, pick up and delivery, etc.  It is not much to look at, but it is fun to figure out the most efficient route to achieve all the tasks.

Stefan Feld's latest has quickly become one of my favourites. 

Perhaps a spiritual successor to "The Castles of Burgundy," "The Oracle of Delphi" is all about mitigating randomness and looking for the most efficient plays. 

Each player has 3 Oracle dice, a unique player power, and an identical set of 12 objectives. Each die has 6 symbols and each colour corresponds to a specific colour. Those colours and symbols are the crux of the game. Every action you take requires a certain symbol to complete, and there are myriad ways to alter, fudge, and entirely bypass symbols. There are so many things possible on any turn, regardless of the symbols rolled, that a "bad" roll is nary a hindrance to well equipped and prepared players.

While there's no direct conflict between players, tensions run high when best laid plans are laid to waste by someone swooping in and stealing objectives, either incidentally or intentionally. Paying attention to what other players are doing is tantamount as perhaps they've seen an easy way to do something you haven't considered.

I'm not sure why so many consider this a race-game. Race in a more literal sense perhaps, as the first player to complete the 12 trials of Zeus, and return to the starting area is the winner. Really, what makes this any more of a race than any game where the winner is determined by the first to reach a certain objective or number of victory points? 

"The Oracle of Delphi" is a great game that I don't think is getting the buzz it deserves.

It's another Feld, but not like some of my favorites. This one is a much lighter pick-up-and-deliver game, with dice. You roll 3 dice every round (which you might be able to manipulate somewhat). On your turn, use the dice to take actions of the matching color (move a ship to a hex of that color, fight a monster of that color, pick up/drop off a temple/good of that color, get some dice manipulators, etc.). You're using these actions to accomplish one of several goals (everyone has the same set). When you complete one, you get some kind of reward. When you complete them all, you get your boat back to the starting space; then, everyone gets one last turn ... most VP wins (?)!

The game is pretty good, I guess. It certainly works, but it's just not all that exciting!

The answer to the question "what if Stefan Feld designed an adventure game", The Oracle of Delphi is a race game where player boats roam around the board completing twelve tasks (build 3 temples, deliver 3 goods, erect 3 statues, defeat 3 monsters). Actions are taken using dice with colour-coded sides; moving to a space requires using a die of that colour for movement, erecting a statue a die of that colour etc. Naturally these can be changed using favour tokens (acquired in at least 4 different ways), and earning the favour of the (colour-coded) gods grants amazing one-time bonuses. Two types of task grant permanent engine-building bonuses.

There's more luck than I expected. Between face-down tiles, two different face-down draw decks and three different kinds of dice it's easy to be screwed or advantaged to a degree significant in an efficiency game. It plays quite well to the extent that it is multiplayer solitaire and luck can be mitigated -- i.e., if a player has a plan and it is not interfered with then they will have a quick turn to execute it. Wide-open turns are much harder because there are so many options; I think it encourages more AP than it deserves.

The artwork is fine but the overall graphic design is unpleasantly garish; the board resembles an explosion in a Skittles factory.

It's a nice change for a Feld game to have a coherent theme and actions which are not just abstract advancement along tracks etc.. Maybe this is "Stefan Feld does Ameritrash".

Very interesting pick up and deliver with a massive amount of luck/randomness.  If your dice rolls go well, you will have a much easier time of it.  Still, I think the decisions are consistently interesting, and the mechanics are original and engaging.  I found myself thinking about this one a lot after I played it.

A Feld without the "salad"!
Instead of collecting victory points, this is a race to finish 12 tasks before the opponents can do it. The gameplay, however, is still very "Feldish" with dice that can be altered and many small bonuses that will affect your play.

This is a race game to do the gods bidding.  using action dice you try to move about the sea completing the 12 tasks Odin has asked you to do.  you can mitigate the luck by gathering godly favor.  I went first and wasted 2 turns learning stuff and that put me behind for the rest of the game.  I am not enamored with race games so while the tension was there.  I really will not promote this games to my gaming group.

The actual play felt somehow nice and entertaining, however I was missing a satisfying part. Interaction is minimal, downtime could be slightly too long, depending on the other players and overall I did not have the feeling that single actions matter significantly for the win. You basically have to plan your path upfront and then adjust depending on where your islands show up. I still have mixed feelings, but tend to pass on this one.

tl;dr: another solid design

Feld is a highly regarded designer by many. And with good reason if you ask me. He has put out great game after very good game. And this one just adds another game to this growing list.
I don't think many will regard this as being his best game. I think the main reason for this is that the game doesn't really offer many different routes to victory. Everyone has a set of 12 goals that are the same for every player, and how you accomplish those is very well defined. So the game comes from deciding what order you complete them in and finding the most efficient route to do so as the goal is to complete all of them.
The game has a lot of different types of components and it looks very complex if you look at that component list. But once it's set up and explained, it's actually very straight forward. And the excellent player aid clearly shows what actions are performed how.
With 2 players it seems like there's not that much competition, it's more of a race, but with more than 2 I think competition for resources and such could be very fierce. I look forward to trying that.

Appallingly bad with red-green color blindness. Some of the colors are off enough to confuse someone with full color vision: for red, the temple sites are a rusty almost-orange, and these are the only significant hidden information. A publisher issue, not a designer issue!

With your unique ship, you have to sail around to move three cubes, three statues, find sites to found three temples, and defeat three monsters, then return to Zeus (Poseidon?). Each of these have rewards, many of which add special powers to make doing later things easier or possible at all. Finding the temple sites is the most random: maybe I had a black swan game, but in revealing two pairs of sites, I found all three of my temple sites, saving me quite a few actions peeking at pairs of sites or challenging a single site, revealing it to an opponent, but getting a reward.

Perhaps because of the black swan luck I had, I found the game rather routine; perhaps it's because you know from the start exactly which twelve tasks you need to do, and to some extent, you do them in order because finding the temple sites is--or should be--slow, and fighting the monsters is hard without some of the powerups. The decisions were there, but they didn't feel as meaningful as some other games'.

RATING: 8
The Oracle of Delphi is a mess. No, really. It's one big pile of mechanisms jammed into a pick-up-and-deliver race to the finish. No points. None. Just a list of errands to run before racing back to the central hex. First one back, wins. Simple. It breaks from Feld's mold of point salad design, but it nonetheless sprawls.

So why is it a mess? Well... What if I told you that this game, released just last year, has the following "features":

1. You have to fight monsters by way of a simple die roll. Higher is always better.
2. You have to search the board for face-down temple tiles that, with luck, match the ones you're hunting.
3. The board is set up randomly, which means that certain players are probably going to gain an advantage if they make it to the easy deliveries first.

Plus! -- remember if you fail any of these tasks, you've wasted your turn. You're now behind. Sure there are ways to mitigate the luck. Favor tokens allow you to re-roll dice, push your ship further, and gain the sort of flexibility you might expect. You're rewarded with special abilities for completing tasks along the way. However, there aren't enough favor tokens to make up for lost time. You'll always be one power short. Remember it's time that you serve. Unless you can invent extra turns, you're never going to make it in time.

Now for the real kicker:

4. Each round you draw an injury card. If you draw too many or the wrong combination (I kid you not), you actually lose a turn! That's right, you just have to sit there and do nothing for a round while everyone else pulls ahead in the race.

What did I tell you? It's a mess! Lets all line up to send Feld emails around the clock telling him how he's not supposed to include things like random die rolls and the potential to lose a turn in his modern game designs. It's 2017 for God's sake!

But here's the thing...

I love this game.

Yes, it's a mess, but it's a fun mess. It's a mess that makes you love it for all its rough edges. It's the type of game design that, quite frankly, I thought was dead dead dead, and buried under twelve feet of discarded Caverna punchboards. The game is fun because it has teeth. It makes you want to win. It makes you angry at your opponents when they pull ahead, frustrated when you are searching the board for that last forsaken temple ("Where is it!??"), and joyful when you're able to complete two tasks in a single turn ("OMG!").

There are too many cards, too many tokens, and too many sub-systems, but at its core the game feels familiar. It's still a Feld game, and you can see where he's hiding his signature optimization puzzles; however, the element of time and race brings it all into laser focus. Where games like Trajan and Bora Bora have interesting action-selection mechanics, their point systems always feel bloated and disjointed. Likewise, you can look at early Feld games like Notre Dame and In the Year of the Dragon for a dose of meanness and the necessity of perfect timing. Oracle feels like Feld has reached a destination. He's travelled through a field of bloated point-optimization games only to circle back to his earlier designs where timing and the avoidance of penalties were the primary objective. Oracle jettisons the bloat but keeps the optimization, and wraps it all up with a mess that feels out of time, like something from an older era. And it really works! Despite what feels like a run of bad luck, the game never makes you feel like you're not in control of your destiny or that skill doesn't matter. That's quite a feet of design.

It's not a perfect game. You can fault it for many of the things I listed above. Losing a turn really does feel awful. However, it's not catastrophic. For example, in one of my plays, two players lost a turn and one of those players went on to win regardless. And I think that may be Oracle's greatest accomplishment -- it convinces you that winning is always possible with just the right amount of finesse. I can't wait to play again.

I'm a huge Feld fan so this was a game I really wanted to try at LT. I'd heard that it was a different beast than his typical game, being a race rather than a point salad, but other than that I didn't know much about it.

Each player has the same 12 tasks they want to complete. The first player to do so and return to the start space wins. The tasks mostly have to do with moving around the board and delivering one thing to another place, or fighting something.

You roll your three dice at the end of your turn and then you can use them on the next turn to do things. One thing you can do is move 3 spaces to a spot matching the color of the die you used. Or pick up something of that color from an adjacent spot. Or deliver something of the color to an adjacent spot. Etc.

I didn't really find the game to be that compelling. The dice mechanic seemed like it might be interesting but I didn't find it compelling. There's a bit of luck as the initial setup can set up some easy plays for the start player. The rolls, while they can be mitigated, are random which is another problem.

All the players in our game were about to finish the game at the same time, and at the end I needed to roll the right color to win and failed, which felt a bit cheap. This is definitely not my favorite Feld game.

About [thing=193558][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=193558][/thing] is the racing game mixed with pick-and-deliver by Stefan Feld, in which players want to get Zeus' favor by fulfilling 12 tasks. Players must build 3 shrines, fight 3 monsters, delivery 3 statues and 3 goods and return to Zeus before anyone else.

[thing=193558][/thing] is a pretty straightforward game: the actions are simple, easy to teach and to play. The complexity is low, mostly coming from special cards and how best use the dice in order to achieve the goals.

There are plenty of random factors in the game, from the dice rolls for the actions, to the attacks at the end of each round, passing by the drawing of cards (of oracle, of rewards and of damage), the reveal of places to build temples and the fight against monsters. These, more or less, can be mitigated by the players - the action dice by using favors, the attacks by increasing fighting; but some are simply out of the players control, and even those that are can be hard to keep under tabs. Therefore, [thing=193558][/thing] requires constant adjustment in the player's choices, becoming highly tatical in nature.

The direct interaction is low - there are blocking, taking what someone else might want or do something before, but, overall, players will be able to do their thing without much hassle: it will be just a matter of keeping an eye on what the others are doing and where they are likely going.

Replay value is high, since there are many random elements (from the players special powers to the set up of the board and the disposition of things on it) which allow for different plays experiences.

Production value os good - cards, tokens and meeples are fine. The dice are engraved and very nice. Art is well done. This is more Trajan than Castles of Burgundy and La Isla.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player starts the game with a ship, normally with two spaces in the cargo hold, and the ship are drawn randomly, since each gives the players their special ability during the game. Everyone starts in the Zeus spot on the board.

The player board have have the wheel for the dice (it serves mostly to inform the cost to change the color of a die) and the track of the favor of the Gods.

In each turn players use their 3 dice to do their actions. Dice have colors on their sides, and this informs what the player is allowed to do. For instance, say a player rolls a Red, a Black and a Blue. Players can only do actions based on the colors they rolled, be to move, to take thing, to deliver, to fight, to reveal. In her turn the player can: move its empty ship to a Black hexagon (using the Black die). There, since the ship is adjacent to a place with a Red statue, the player can use her Red die to take it and put it in the cargo hold, using one of the two spaces the ship has. Now, the ship is also adjacent to a place with goods - but there isn't a blue good there. But there is a yellow. The player pays one favor of Zeus, to change the color of the die from Blue to Yellow, and uses it to take the yellow good. Now the ship is full. The player has used her three actions, and since she don't have or don't want to use an extra action (an oracle card), she ends her turn by rolling her three dice. If the other players have a God in the favor track, not in the zero position, whose color matches one of the colors rolled in the dice, they can advance the favor of it one step - only one God can be advanced, even if the player has multiple Gods whose color matched. When a God reaches the throne, the player can, afterwards (during her own turn), use the special power of this God, as a free action - then the God returns to the zero position.

When a goal is fulfilled, the player receives a reward - can be allies, a permanent ability, favors from Zeus, etc.

At the end of the each round the last player rolls, alogside their action dice, the black die, which will say the level of attack received by each player. If the player doesn't have enough shields to defend, she receives a wound. If, at the start of her turn the player has either three wounds of the same color or six wounds in total, she loses a turn and get rid of three wounds.

Game proceeds like this, with players doing their actions based on the colors of the dice rolled, getting things and delivering them elsewhere, fighting and building, dealing with the favor of the Gods, and so on, until someone has completed the 12 tasks and returned to Zeus. This person will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are several, but most are simple and very clear, demaning little in terms of thought. The main ones are:
- How best use the action dice. This is made by trying to make the most of the colors rolled without using too much of Zeus' favors, as these can be very important to winning a battle against the monsters, or will be needed to make a key action;
- Picking routes. This might be even more important in the big picture than using the actions in the best way possible, due to the racing mixed with pick and deliver nature of the game. With a good route you open yourself not only to make more tasks faster, while also allowing more colors to be used to achieve what you want, and, maybe, having less competition for things and places;
- Which Gods to favor;
- Which rewards to take;
- What to do first, second, third... Be because is quicker and allow to make multiple tasks in one go, be to get sooner some important special power.

[thing=193558][/thing] allows for a good amount of decisions throughout the play, but once a route is decided, most of what you will need and what you must do, is already decided, and is just a matter to make them as fast as possible.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Tries, for the most part, be colorblind friendly;
- Language independent;
- A good mix of strategy (route) and tatic (most of the other decisions);
- Some amount of indirect interaction;
- Light, but with a nice set of decisions.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Many random elements and luck can be a deciding factor;
- Players powers don't seem balanced;
- Little actual theme.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
More like Iolaus than Hercules. There is some excitement in [thing=193558][/thing] - many coming from the random factors: will I get a wound and lose a round? How I will fare in a fight against the Medusa? Can this be the place to build a temple? And, of course, rolling the die and sighting or cheerring about the result. But the enjoyment during play was low: the actions felt a lot mechanical and was simply a matter of going from A to B, as smoothly as the dice and the favor allow it.

The racing is a constant pressure to go bold or go home, yet, for the most part, the dispute never reached a very high point or a big low: it stayed in that dull middle level - not truly boring, never all that exciting either.

The random elements, though positive in some aspects, can cause serious harm to a player - we had a play in which the person was constantly having problems in getting his game going, not due a single thing, but little by little of several bad luck moments.

In the end, [thing=193558][/thing] was a forgettable experience: I wasn't offend nor enthralled by it. [thing=193558][/thing] has a good set of positive things, making itself as a light game with a nice group of decisions and high replay value, but, specially for those looking for more interaction, tension and control, [thing=193558][/thing] won't deliver. Though it has plenty of colors, overall, it is mostly gray.

I do not normally like games in which players are racing each other in order to complete a set number of objectives the fastest, but The Oracle Of Delphi was really entertaining! The pick up and deliver puzzle is interesting, and the dice make the game feel less dry than it could have been. The best part of it, however, is that the game feels pretty streamlined, just as Herr Feld's earlier efforts (like Notre Dame and Year Of The Dragon). Would love to play again.

An underrated Feld game. It's a little outside of his comfort zone: More theme than usual, adventure elements and no VP, but still distinctly him. 

When I first read through the rulebook I was going to call this "Stefan Feld's Mage Knight". It's in fact mostly a pick up and deliver racing game, though there are few similarities such as vaguely RPG esque character upgrades, "color coded" mechanics (action dice = mana dice?) and wounds that can force you to skip turns.

I guess in the end it had some elements that Feldians didn't like ("dice chucking" combat) without being thematic enough to cross over into the growing "hybrid Euro" market that games like Mage Knight are part of.

RATING: 8
I'm a themes man, when it comes to board games, so one set in the classical age of Greece revolving around a set of twelve (labours) tasks set by Zeus scores highly. The hardest part of the game was trying to fit the pieces together! Krapton Factor was probably as good as it got but we finally managed success after five minutes or more. Each player is a hero and destined to face twelve challenges, building temples, making offerings, fighting monsters and raising statues. They have a unique benefit such as additional favour, the currency of this game, additional ship movement and avoiding one if the tasks, the ones in play yesterday. The tasks can be attempted in any order so working out, as far as you can, the optimum route is key to succeeding. There are a number of mechanisms to keep an eye on throughout the game, including the god's track, the movement and alteration of the oracle dice, acquiring avatars (bonuses from task completion) and avoiding three injury cards of the same colour or five of any colour, as this results in a turn being lost for that hero. This was key to the outcome, yesterday, although all three players lost an equal number of turns. The artwork, cards and playing pieces are nice enough, but not outstanding but micro ancient ships and/or hero pieces could be used to add a little more flavour. This is not a criticism of the game. There are two key aspects to this game, in my view, one of which I managed well, the other not so much. Each hero wants the continued support of a variety of gods including Ares and Poseidon, each of which will yield one boon when they get to the top of the god track, which a view of the player mat will easily identify. This boon may be used immediately the top space is reached or held in reserve. The players are advised to try and spend oracle dice to put the worship of the gods in place so that each time one of the other heroes throws an oracle dice of the same colour as the god, they can select one god from those on their god track to move ahead one space. Inevitably, five players will generate more opportunities whereas three will logistically result in fewer of these. Being able, as with Poseidon's boon, to move from any position on the world board to any other space, is very useful towards the end, as I found which allowed me to run a close second. The other point to watch out for is the mechanism to site your three temples. This involves exploring 'hidden' islands in search of three sites that each player must put their temples on. I was fortunate in that two of mine were revealed by the other heroes, but not all exposure is known, so don't count on this every game that is played. Given the optimum route is what improves success, searching needs to be done from the beginning of the game but not to the exclusion of other task completion. I would finish by outlining that oracle dice are randomised by throwing each turn. Dice can be altered, by counting the number of clockwise spaces they must travel to get to the desired space, as the dice generated actions are 'colour-reliant'. So, you cannot move to a coloured sea space that you do not have the correct coloured dice for. this is true for retrieving statues and/or re-erecting them on an appropriate island. Favour chits are the means to do so provided there is an equal number of these or better to allow the dice to be moved sufficiently. There are scrolls (maps) that enable heroes to acquire additional boons like allowing them to be within one square of a destination to complete retrieval and/or erection actions! I believe ties are decided by the number of avatar bonus cards at the end but my memory may be suspect here. An excellent game I'd play again.

Another solid design from Stefan Feld. The Oracle of Delphi offers tons of interesting decisions and does so with a very intuitive set of rules. I love the fact that everything in this game is color-coded, it's very easy to navigate among all the available options (though the red and pink colors are way too similar).

I do have some issues with the game concerning the ultra long setup, randomness of combat die rolls and wound cards (there's nothing I hate more than losing turns, no modern board game should implement mechanics like that anymore), but the flaws didn't overshadow the overall enjoyment I had when playing it. It's not a must-have, but it's definitely worth checking out.

My initial impression is that this game is entertaining, but setup is complex and the game takes far longer than it should, particularly on a first play. Perhaps repeated plays will smooth out the kinks with increased familiarity.

Ancient Greek mythos competition to complete Zeus's twelve legendary tasks around the islands of the modular interlocked hex tile Aegean Sea.  Erect statues and sanctuaries, make offerings, and slay beasts.  It's an action salad race with a smorgasbord of mechanics.  Oracle dice determine actions using colored faces to explore the hex islands tiles and pick up and deliver.  Interesting movement puzzle to match the action dice with the same color destination hex.  Slay monsters with a simple modified d10 combat.  Gain favor with the Gods track for gifts!  Roll dice at the end of the turn to plan next moves which speeds play and might provide a passive benefit to the other players.  Set collection for ship damage,  Random potential damage to all players from the Titan.  Get upgrades and allies, lots of ways to mitigate bad dice luck with numerous secondary actions including a rondel for changing a dice color.  A lot of favorite things to do in a game that work together.  Is it too much in one game I wonder?

Not sure why many are so down on this game.  It has a Feldian feel to it: dice mitigation like in Bora Bora or CoB, exploration and modular map like in Amerigo, min/max and efficiency valuation, injury cards like the plague penalty in Bruges, and some others.  

And maybe because I just played Roads and Boats before this one that it had a similar feel to it.  Don't get me wrong, it's not at all like R&B, but it has logistics and efficiency in common.  Like R&B-lite...super lite!  But fun nonetheless.

Good game but I have a difficult time differentiating two of the colors(pink and red).  Feld does use symbols to help distinguish the colors but in some cases the symbols don't help and I may have lost the game because of it.

I really love Castles of Burgundy (the only Feld I had played) and really looked forward to this but the decisions to be made in this game didn't feel very interesting to me. Still  liked it but not as much as I hoped. It feels like a simple light game with easy decisions to be made: more of a family game rather than a brain burner.
I have only played 2 players so far so my rating may change.

One of my favorite and most often played games. Great replayability thanks to the modular board and different ships' powers. Optimal play time as well; easy setup and takedown, a little luck but a lot of strategy as well. All in all, a fantastic game.

My opinion after my 1st play (in French) : https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/211725/item/4933505?commentid=6664340#comment6664340

Too bland in my taste, a lot of random/chance factors, a lot of pick-up-and-deliver, some colour problems (partially compensated by the use of symbols), the set-up seems quite random, the player mats are not as practical as I would expect ...

I think I will play the Feld games I enjoy and/or try the other Feld games before playing this one again.

I [b]love[/b] much of what this game has to offer, but it can be very disheartening for someone to see the game end while they still have 5 of their tasks left to complete. That very visible utter failure undoes so much of the delicious, agonizing lateral thinking you get to do. Of course, the wonderful parts of the game are extremely susceptible to analysis paralysis.

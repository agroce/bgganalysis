RANK: 1788

RATING: 7
Not my dream historical game but quick (when the rule are down) and fun none the less. 

My first army to own is the Xyston Mini Alexandrian Macedonian 355BC - 320BC.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite miniature wargames. The rules are simple enough, and the reduced size of the armies allow you to easily and affordably collect many different armies. The only downside is the language: not many people are fluent in Barkerese :P

RATING: 4
Cheap 'n' cheerful ancients/medieval ruleset. Played a bit mid - late 90's. Dislike the rules writing (more like a logic problem) and rolling command points - C&C:A has a much better way of handling Command and Control. Dated. And it brings out the "Anal Gamer" in people due its ultra prcise basing/frontage etc rules. Iwould play it as a quickie (in a campaign say) but would suggest something else first - like Monopoly !

I have not played this game for years, but I do so enjoy it.  My gameing buddy has a wonderful collection of dBA minatures, but we hve been very neglectful of them lately.  It has minatures, strategy, you get to make your own armies, and it is in a grat play-space size.  My enjoyment of this game has gotten me into Flames of War, but I have yet to play it.

Not a bad set of miniature rules, but I'm not sure I'm a miniatures person deep down.  Of all games in which one spends eight hours slowly losing from an initial setup mistake, tabletop miniatures is the undisputed king.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.3
Keep getting stuck in the odd situation (rather common situations in my opinion) where I don't know if the move is allowed or not. Probably not. The minimalist rule book ain't much help there.
 
Feels more like a spatial puzzle than a battle game.
On the plus side the activation with pips which places a high importance on keeping the formations in groups. (Something that is missing in Impetus for example.)
Anyways, I think I'll take my rice and millet armies and move on to Basic Impetus...

Played a few times. Have a 15mm ancient Greek and Persian army.

Now that the youngster is getting interested, dragged this out and realised a good entry level game for miniatures. The thing thats been holding me back is re basing all my figures from 30mm to 40mm frontage. Time consuming but can now potentially muster:

* Early Hopolite
*Spartan
* Northern Gk Hopolite
* Early Persian
*Late Persian
*Successor
*Scythian
*Thracian

Currently learning v3.0 of rules with my son. A fantastic game that has added a lot of depth compared to earlier versions (and DBMM style contact rules which I love). My preference is for asymmetric wargames so I am not mad about the 12 elements a side rule but nonetheless this is a fantastic ruleset in a very small package. I also strongly favor the way it does army lists over DBM/MM - the idea of playing a preparation game that can lose the main battle does not appeal to me these days.

[url=http://www.wadbag.com/DBAGuide/TheUnofficialGuideToDBA_single.pdf]Free[/url] and [u]elegant[/u] table-top wargame miniature system with simple rules, short playing time, high scalability and great tactical/strategic depth.

It is a lot of work on assembling and painting before first game can be played. The 3W game [i]Ancients[/i] can replace it successfully.

My favorite miniatures system. This was like a dream come true for me because of the variety of armies I've collected and the short playing time.  I have many 15 mm armies and several 25 mm armies.  Need to brush up on last rule changes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, simple miniatures game but the presentation of the rules is lousy, confusing and poor.  Get a player aid right off the bat. I think I've painted up about ten 25mm Foundry armies and I think all the battles are beginning to feel the same, line up twelve stands and crash into your opponent.  I guess I've burned out.  Never could get my Gauls to beat the Romans....

RATING: 7
a brilliant fast play somewhat easy to learn minis game.  The writers desire to make the manual's language some what obtuse causes much confusion at first.  In general after 3 or 4 plays the fog of rules issue quickly becomes clearer.  Highly recommended for any fan of historical miniatures.  Free extensions on line take this game from very ancient through Boer War!  A must for any miniature gamer.  I would score this a 10 easily if the authors attempted to write in clear english rather than an obtuse form of the Queen's own.

My current favorite miniatures game. It gives me everything I want in a miniatures game with the smallest painting and modeling commitment, while still using enough miniatures to look pretty. It doesn't take long to paint an army, and there are tons of armies to chose from. The game plays in about an hour, and strips away the clutter of most war-games leaving only the most meaningful decisions.

In my case at least, going out to play DBA often means just getting to play DBA. I like more variety in my gaming sessions, and find myself turning to pure boardgames more often than not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Fiddly trickery in moves wins.  Also, the variance of a single d6 roll determines the number of moves you get per turn; e.g., it is common for one player to randomly be awarded 3-4x the number of moves as his opponent in a streak of 2-4 turns.

I don't see how the game-play has anything to do with ancient warfare.

C&C ancients is light, quick, and has some luck.  I like it.

This game, sucks.  It gets a 3 because the historical research and army lists are cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Playing version 2.2+

I'm starting to get into this and somehow it looks neat. I prefer to play right now with bidimensional bases and flatland terrain. 

As for now I played the Byzantine against the Longobards in Northern Italy. The Longobards put their warbands in front of their knights, I charged with my cavalry and destroyed them, winning the game even after losing the General. 

In the second game I played the Imperial Arabs against a Thematic Byzantine counter-attack. I made the mistake of putting too many bad goings and was entrapped in them, also my spearmen could do nothing to his cavalry! An highlight of the game was the Byzantine light cavalry fleeing the battlefield after having attacked my camp. 

UPDATE
A lot of fun for an ancients game. Really wanting to play this again.

Good game system to introduce players to minis as well as the period.  Not deep but it 'is' a wargame.  I personally don't play DBA much as I prefer much more detail, but for what it attempts it is the best I have seen in this period.  Rules do suffer from the same poor writing that DBM does ("Barkerese").  But, soooo many people can and do play this game it gets a full  1 on the rating for ease of playing and finding opponents (considering this 'is' ancients miniatures after all...)

The 3rd edition rulebook is vastly improved over the previous ones, especially the diagrams. Well worth the increased cost. The rules changes (reflecting DBM) seem interesting, but I've not tried them yet: I'm especially looking forward to having a go with fast blades as a rapid strike force (but slightly less durable than old-style blades).
The army lists and historical notes are also great value, especially for the more obscure armies (although it has the unfortunate side-effect of making me want armies I'd never heard of before).
Current project: Sumerians - plenty of pike and a couple of chariots for mobility should make these a pretty solid force against most of their historical opponents - they may be vulnerable to massed bows though.

So much more player friendly than any previous Ancients rules. DBA has revolutionised ancients miniatures gaming! It seems to give the right results without a dice fest and a heap of factors to add up. It got me back into ancient wargaming after a 10 year sojourn into board gaming. Armies are now small enough that they are now affordable and paintable, giving players the means to build a number of armies.

If you like miniatures and the ancient periods then this game is a great place to get your fix.  By itself the rule book is really only good for it's army lists.  The rules proper are horribly written but luckily the game itself is good despite this.  The fix is to head to the website of the Washington Area DBA Group or WADBAG.  They have have their Unofficial Guide to DBA which is what the rulebook should have been.  Clear rules with examples and diagrams.  In all, the small figure count with a choice in scales (I did 1/72 plastics) and the low cost rules result in a perfect start or a long stay in miniature wargaming.

(UhhhClem) 

If you want to play a real miniatures game without spending a ton of money, Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is an excellent place to start. It's played with cards, which has three consequences: the units all have the same size bases, battles look a little underwhelming, and (relative to, say, Warhammer, to which it is a solid competitor) it is dirt cheap.

Another alternative: get a copy of De Bellis Antiquitatis (better yet, find someone who knows how to play and have them teach you), buy a bunch of appropriately-sized bases from the likes of Litko Aerosystems (super cheap), write the unit types on them and add a facing arrow, and you're good to go. DBA is one of the best games I've ever played period: there's nearly a lifetime of gameplay in that little nearly-incomprehensible book.

Very tactical wargame, not based on the power of a single unit but in the use of combination of the different units like spears vs cavalry, cavalry vs archers, etc. I liked and was amazed that this is a game with more than 20 years and is very actualized with many nowday games.

The games are over so fast that there is no emotional investment in the game & the nature of the game does not really allow for wibbles in the way that DBM (or DBMM or FoG) allow. It is therefore the ideal tournament game and for that reason I've re-evaluated the score & raised it to 8. If someone makes me hate them in 30 minutes over a game of DBA, they must really be trying.

There is no battlefield economics with this as there is in army sized points driven games, each side gets 12 elements & each will be useful in different situations in a "paper, scissors, rock" resolution sort of way. In that context, the game is quite chess like from a perspective of "material".

Now into v3, all sorts of minor fixes here & there but the basic strategy & tactic remains no matter what DBx game you play, roll higher than your opponent & you'll win consistently.

I really like playing this at conventions but the rules keep changing all the time! Jimbo pulls his hair out trying to figure things out or we would play it more. Naked Gauls are just soooo cute!

RATING: 9
One of my most favourite games.  It is highly abstracted, not well written and requires some fiddly geometry but it is really a work of genius.  A great intro game for kids or new players - if you explain it first.  Also suitable for a serious game as skilled players can capitalise on their experience.

Works really well in the Big Battle mode with up to six players.  I'll play this anytime I get the chance.

Very playable and fun rules set.  Games are very small and quick, less than an hour.  Fun to paint up the little armies.  A great way to try out an army before making a big investment.

RATING: 5
Played a few times here and there.  Light, short and has the advantage of requiring few figures and little table space.  Meant as an introduction to ancients/medieval miniatures wargaming -people who crave detail, chrome and options won't find enough here to keep their attention.  Historical restrictions mostly thrown out the window - units and armies behave unrealistically.   A dice fest where even the best plan can be ruined by bad rolls.  Understanding the right match-ups and chasing the opponent's vulnerable units are key.

It is too short and too simple of a wargame for me to get very excited about.  I'm also not much of a fan of assembling/painting armies, which makes it difficult for me to really get into the miniatures wargaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bought this as a last-ditch effort to get into miniatures (a longtime dream that never panned out).  It didn't work.  But it's a nice little game in its own right, once you learn to decipher Phil Barker's writing.

RATING: 4
Favorite miniatures game of all - light, quick, not expensive to get into, vast historical range, portable, teachable, reasonably good game in its own right.  Some play balance issues among certain armies, certainly some dice luck, but always fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The forerunner of DBM, which I had played first. DBA mist smaller and simpler, but with 12 elements apiece the system favours heavy armies over those with only light troops. I won the UK DBA Championships twice (a small affair), once with 25mm Pyrrhic and again with 15mm Medieval French.

Could never really see the point of this, but it was quick and there was a minimal amound of dice rolling. I suppose it is a good entry level for miniatures, but wouldn't it be better to play a simple (board) wargame instead?

This miniature wargame has simple rules, but great tactical and strategic depth.  It provides the most interesting tactical decisions per minute of any ancients miniature ruleset I know.

The main downside is finding opponents if you don't have a regular play group.  Luckily I've solved that for myself.

Rating based on the DBAOL online version.  Fascinating game that simultaneously makes you feel like the dice rule your life and convinces you that skill is hugely important.  I love this game. 142 plays online and 13 plays face-to-face.

In person, it's occasionally frustrating to deal with elements of figures that can't stand in base-to-base contact with one another.  I might actually consider basing my 15mm armies on 25mm bases to give them a little more breathing room.

DBA 3:
My rating has gone up from "8" to "9" for the 3rd revision of the rules. Many of the old problems are gone. The only new "problem" that I have spotted so far is that "Fast" troops are nearly always much preferable to "Solid" troops. However: The game moves rapidly and playing the weaker armies is fun.

This is for DBA 2.2:
Slightly dryish, but that can be overcome if the players wish so. Not as simple as some make it seem to be. Rules can be fiddly, geometry is an issue. All that can be remedied by gentlefolkly behaviour and by not creating situations that might cause trouble. 

For DBA 3:
DBA 3 is much faster and has more potential for big swings. Battles feel more dramatic and a bit more chaotic. I much prefer DBA 3.

If the geometry is taken serious, I would rate it a 2. In a relaxed atmosphere, it *really* shines brightly.

My rating reflects DBA played in a non-competitive, relaxed setting.

Avoid competitive tournament style play like the plague.

OWNED, but I do not list books here anymore as it distorts the figures for board games owned.

A great simple miniatures wargame.  Tons of nationalities for eras from the stone age to musket & pike.  Miniatures are no longer my thing, but I've kept the book(pamphlet)  around because the last few pages has simple rules for a multiplayer campaign that has always been my dream to try at least once.  Maybe some cutout card board stands with just the unit written on them or something.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Miniatures gaming for ancient and medieval times, playable with a minimum investment in figures and time. Unfortunately, the official book is written in a dense prose that is practically unreadable, besides failing to explain some important points. There is tremendous potential here, but you really need to learn the system from a mentor. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
I'm not one that has the patience nor the skill to paint miniatures, so my exposure to them will always be limited.  However, this game was pretty entertaining and simulates the ancient battlefield quite well.  It's a bit luck-based with the dice rolls and the pips, but accepting that with a grain of salt, it's pretty fun.  An enjoyable, short tactical game.

UPDATE: Now playing it after several years, I think it's a bit too luck-based, although still a fun model of ancient warfare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not really a board game, but a favorite table top wargame after the mighty Napoleon's Triumph.  Very historically based and therefore you can have horrendously unbalanced armies, but that is the fun of this game.  Fast play, some luck (as was the case in real life) and a good deal of tactics required.  I have two painted 25mm metal armies from Foundry Miniatures, Early Imperial Romans and the Huns and one in the process of being painted, the army of Alexander.  Good rule system that takes a little deciphering. Often underrated by war gamers who feel they want more depth.  I never turn down an opportunity to play.  Has some similarity to Command and Colors: Ancients, another favorite of mine.  DBA is easy to get into with minimal investment required.  Update:  Have not played in a long time, but Lost Battles is scratching the itch.

I have been playing this game on and off for over 10 years. 

As a wargamer, some times you want a game that is quick to collect and throw on the table, has simple rules and just works.

This, for me, is that game.

I usually play the big battle variant, I find this the most rewarding.

It covers from the first states that formed in the Middle East all the way through to the war of the roses, essentially until black powder weapons took over the battlefield.

RATING: N/A
"De Bellis Antiquitatis is one of my all-time top 10 games of any kind, and as miniatures games go, it's relatively easy to get into. (Each army contains only 12 elements, usually of inexpensive 15mm figures, and at 15mm the play area is 2' square.) It's fast-playing, extremely variable, and deep."

RATING: 10
My all-time favorite wargame!  The game is simple in concept and the armies are small, but the subtleties of actual game play take quite a bit of time to master.  After 20 years, this is still a convention tournament mainstay!  I have played this game literally hundreds of times and have won many a tournament.  However, version 3.0 stinks in my opinion.  2.2 was the pinnacle for me and I am saddened by the split in the DBA community.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The appeal here is ultra-fast playing time for a miniatures wargame, the small number of figures required for a mass-battle game, the ability to use any ancients/medievals models you have, and a very complete rules-set that's jam-packed with army lists. However, the rules writing borders on incomprehensible at times and the combat is fairly bland. I still don't understand why this is the most popular set of ancients rules on the planet. Odd.      
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A straightforward set of miniatures rules which allows tactical decisions without getting bogged down in the mire of army specific differences since these are all subsumed into the orverall rule set. It has it purist critics, but I think it works as a decent test of generalshi, provided each tabletop army only engages its historical equivalents.

RATING: 10
A miniatures game, may or may not use a board. Numerous army lists to demonstrate ancient and medieval warfare. Key aspect to game is troop type interactions leading to victory. Use of terrain matters, as does deployment and overall battle line planning and support. Easy to learn, challenge to master, like chess. Recommended for anyone who likes figures, painting and building scenery, or would want to try these fun things.

Additional information: For those of you who want individually based miniatures, especially larger scale miniatures (like 1/72 scale or 25mm plus), you can simply use a movement tray or magnetic base provided the tray/added base has a uniform front length, 60mm, 80mm, etc. This way you can use miniatures for other rule systems individually.

It seemed simple enough but how much time would one need to dedicate to it to learn all the various attack/defence factors cos it would take the shine off it for me if I had to keep interupting play to look at the tables.

A back to the roots version of a wargame. Simple and reasonable mechanics leaving enough room for the player.

On the other hand, some armies are better than others, and the 12 element setup is limiting. So, DBA serves best as an introduction.

Just plain fun...both as a student and as a master.  It was crazy being the master...I could have been insanely devilish but it would have been quite unfun as a filler...Wanna a copy!

A great game.  Gets bonus points because Zendo is so amazingly creative & original.  Seeing how the game works is just as interesting as playing it.  Wait, "seeing how the game works" is "playing it".  Woah...

LIKE: Very, very clever game. Love the simplicity of the pieces but the interesting way to deduct what the master's rule is.
DISLIKE: Game could go on forever. No restraints on how difficult a rule could be.

OVERALL: Such a neat little game, I was impressed. If it could be streamlined a little more it would be a knockout.

Good fun game that can tax the brain. Does depend though on people not creating anything too difficult to decipher! Can certainly have some good fun with this, especially catching people off guard with the initial setup.

Maybe Zendo WAS created by Buddha himself, it seems to me that it might be the PERFECT game. Really, think about it. (1) The rules are so simple you don't even have to explain them. Just start playing, everybody will understand just by watching. (2) It is short. A full game takes about 5 minutes. (3) It is long. You can play it for hours without ever getting bored. (4) It has lovely components. And lots of them. (5) It is, by definition, aesthetically pleasing. (6) It can be arbitrarily complex, it works as a drinking game and it works as a study object for a group of guys with PhDs in mathematics.

There might be more, but it doesn't matter. It is easy to see that Zendo, quite obviously, has the Buddha nature. Love it.

this game is a wonderful group exercise in logic.  best of all, for those of you who aren't fortunate enough to have some pyramids, it can be played (or at least approximated) with almost any reasonably sized set of objects with consistent commonalities and differences (e.g. legos, set cards)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very cool game, both in how it plays as well as how it looks. Works best with easier rules since this one can drag a bit if the rule gets too hard and the players don't catch on to some aspect of the rule early. Can be used in a classroom to teach the scientific method.

One of the only inductive logic games I know.  The bits (and Buddist theme) make this one better than Eulsis, the game it&#039;s based on.  I&#039;d rate it higher, but the game suffers a sort of apex effect in that, as people try to grasp the &quot;answer&quot;, their various &quot;kohns&quot; start out being more and more helpful... but then pass a certain point and start becoming less and less helpful.  The table gets too crowded with examples and thus it becomes harder to take an intentionally wrong guess in order to get some help from the Master.

RATING: 5
Once people understand how to play it, Zendo really catches on.  More a puzzle than a game, it promotes both thought-provoking discussion (the Students discussing each structure) and childish mockery (the Master laughing at their pathetic guesses).

Update: I have some friends that really like this, but I have to be in the right mood.  Otherwise Zendo just feels slow and irritating.

Thinky abstract game focusing on inductive reasoning, the reasoning behind the scientific method. From two structures made with plastic pieces by a "moderator" the other player(s) must figure out a secret rule (i.e. structures must contain a certain shape, color, number of pieces, etc.) A unique challenge and interesting play. Not for everyone, but I love the way it melts my mind!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
You don't need the Icehouse pieces to play Zendo, but using them is lesson one on your route to an endlessly recyclable state of gaming bliss. Actually, as far as I'm concerned, without Zendo, the entire Icehouse system would have far less reason to exist, regardless of how many game titles it has added to its sexy looking, and quick-sprawling, extended pyramid-family. The two were made for each other.

A guess-the-rule game won't be to everyone's taste, but this is one that will appeal to a far wider crowd than just those game sleuths who enjoy all entries in the competitive-puzzle-game genre.

Players (or Students) try to crack the rule that is set by one other player (the Master). At the start, the Master builds two constructions: one that is marked as following the secret rule, and one that is marked as breaking it. Then, in turn, each student builds one construction, to be marked by the Master as following the rule, or not. As the game progresses, players will hypothesize and experiment their way towards a solution, based on information that can be deciphered from all marked constructions, which are visible to all. 

Now, this might sound like it is a game for brainiacs who enjoy a taxing head-to-head challenge, but in reality the tasks are more often tackled in a curious semi-co-operative environment, especially when a particular nut proves very hard to crack. This peculiar atmosphere does result in a game experience that appeals to many people who would normally run a mile if you throw words like "inductive logic", "experimentation" and "hypothesis" at them, even when mumbled from a distance.

The variety of constructions that can be made using only simple pyramid shapes in 3 sizes and 4 colours, combined with the ability to stack, balance, touch, and point the stylish pieces, seems to offer just the right amount of rules possibilities that will keep players guessing, without letting them face the impossible.

Surprisingly, this is not a game for players who want to prove how clever they are by setting complex tasks. They are missing the point. Simple rules often work best, and personally I would argue that the cleverest Masters are those who can mask the simplest of rules particularly well, using a minimum amount of pieces. I also feel there should be a ban on the word "OR", especially in the "longer" rules. Combining two complex, but completely unrelated conditions into one ueber-condition causes needless frustration and often proves only ill-judgement by the person who set it. In contrast, a well-chosen simple rule that describes a single condition yet keeps players baffled for the same amount of time, is guaranteed genuine appreciation once revealed.

Don't be surprised if no-one is keeping score. Playing it, whilst trying to unravel the mystery, seems to be the more important drive, and for that reason the quasi-Zen-Buddha Master and Student theme is well-chosen. It also drives me bonkers, as this is so unashamedly abstract, that pretending that something has "Buddha Nature", instead of "yup, it follows the rule" just sounds like unnecessary pretentious drivel to me. Don't start me on calling "Mondo".

To me, this game is a great improvement on its main inspiration, Eleusis. The introduction of the "negative construction" being the main one. What I do miss is some sort of appreciation of how well the Master did. When the Master picks a simple task that results in an entire table filled with constructions, and still keeps the players guessing, that deserves more recognition than that given to the player who eventually cracks it.

The only thing that puzzles me is why you should only be able to cash in a guess on your turn. It might be nice to give all players who have guess-stones, the option to cash one(?) in after each player's turn (and guesses), especially when many players are playing. It seems utterly unfair that a player, who has genuinely cracked it, must wait for the turn to come back round, as all players until then can crack it "earlier", but needing far more constructions to do so. And since guessing early, but getting it wrong, would result in an extra "disprove" construction, it does mean that all other players have more info then they otherwise would have had at the start of their turns, so there is a consequence for getting it wrong too.

When a rule is proving hard, it is also likely that there aren't enough pyramids in the box to keep building experiments for judgement without dismantling something. A second set isn't often called upon, but it's great when one is available when needed, as these are often the more memorable occasions too.

With the right players, this is a true gem. What makes it stand out, is that this is also the type of gem that easily converts even passers-by into exactly the right players. Worth a try.

RATING: 8
This is a great game, but a few things stand in the way of making it a '9' or a '10'.  First, through no fault of the game itself, it seems difficult to find 'traditional gamers' that can enjoy this. It seems that if they can't min/max, bid, or roll dice they're not having 'fun'. Secondly, and more importantly is the lack of a feeling of competition.  It's hard to gauge how close you are to beating others, when winning is essentially an act of 'Eureka! I've got it'.  
The zen theme is great and reminds me of a nice passage from Douglas Hofstadter's 'A MU Offering':
Zen master Gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a question about Zen. A young novice began to imitate him in this way. When Gutei was told about the novice's imitation, he sent for him and asked him if it were true. The novice admitted it was so.  Gutei asked him if he understood. In reply the novice held up his index finger.  Gutei promptly cut it off. The novice ran from the room, howling in pain. As he reached the threshold, Gutei called, "Boy!" When the novice turned, Gutei raised his index finger. At that instant the novice was enlightened.'

Wonderful game where players try to guess a rule based on building sets of pyramids. A nice analogy for demonstrating the scientific principle (you can never know you are right, only that your theory fits the available evidence).

I like deduction games, and I like how this moves along, only being able to guess when you've acquired a chip.  However, it is excruciating when you discover the answer, but it is past you in turn order.  Then, somebody else gets the win, but may have discovered the answer after you.  I think this maybe better by going in draft order, and after every turn, you submit your best guess to the moderator, or something like that.  Or, play with 2-3 and 1 moderator.

Brilliant concept. My only complaint is that there could be more variety with the pieces (I need to get some more icehouse pieces), since after a few playings it seems all of the possible combos are used (without getting obscure to the point of not being fun anymore). Also a little awkward if you have the wrong number of players. 4 or 5 is best or the game plays much worse.

RATING: 8
The epic game of induction! Zendo is a game like no other. I love deduction games, so naturally I like this one too. My wife isn’t keen on Mastermind, but she does enjoy this without being able to explain exactly why. To me, Zendo is a magnificent game which can cause a meltdown of your brain if the correct answer (when exactly the koan has Buddha nature) is hard! So far I don’t want to start playing with the rules about the dots and about touching each other as I don’t feel skilled enough, but most of the time it’s still very hard to guess the correct solution; however, we always manage to crack the code, just like it should be.

Zendo isn’t really a “game” which I can write a lot about because it is more like an experience; and a damn good one indeed! I highly recommend it (yes, it’s OOP, but you can find the rules and buy the ice pyramids online, and if you want you can buy a bunch of question cards from Artscow).

Curious game which appeals only to certain people. I thought I'd like it (and I do), but logic puzzles are not everyone's cup of tea. I bought the game so I have sufficient stashes for other Icehouse games.

[b]Update[/b] Upon playing Zendo for real with other people I discovered to my surprise that they took a genuine liking to it, especially since the problems can be given any expression which make matters very hard indeed. It's not really a game in the way I usually think of them, but the pastime is certainly sufficiently agreeable to bring out the game to a game day once every while. There aren't any complex rules to be explained, after all.

Absolutamente genial. Un juego de pura lógica y azar zero, una verdadera joya dentro de un mundo de dados incesantes. El rol del maestro puede ser aburrido, pero verá el humillo que sale de las orejas de los demás jugadores al tratar de adivinar cuál es esa maldita regla, que siempre resulta ser más fácil de lo que parece.
Pagaría gustosamente lo que vale la caja de este juego (lo tengo en P&P), vale cada gramo de plástico (incluso de aire) que lleva.

Components: Sturdy, attractive pyramids and stones. Not quite as nice when having to cobble together a set, without the pre-packaged box.

Experience: Great game of logic and guesswork. The turns move quickly, and each new structure, true or false, deepens the mystery. One of few games that adapt to player desired difficulty.

Ambiguity

Ambiguity: The property wherein a thing has more than one interpretation.

Of all of Empson's seven types, and more. 

"What is that?" "What does it do?" "Where does it go?" "What is its value?" 

Those are the questions I want a game to ask.

But, I like ambiguity even at the meta-game level, where the game itself is in question.

Zendo might be a good example of this. Is there any sense in which you're "playing a game" of Zendo? I don't know. It's an activity, it has rules and a rigid structure, it has a "winner" [of each round]. 

But, the game isn't about winning [and it isn't even about the tired Knizia quote's "goal that is important, not the winning"]. The game is about not winning for as long as possible until something interesting happens.

The goal as a player of Zendo is to create an interesting game experience for all involved.

Do you make random assertions and see how they work out?

Do you make a rule as master that is devilishly clever yet easy to grasp once uncovered? 

Do you progress by making tiny modifications to things you already know, in hopes of deducing small elements of the big picture, or do you make koans that are as wildly different from all known information as possible?

Is the game about guessing rules or is it about how to guess rules? Is the game a game at all, or is it a simulation of scientific processes of induction? I don't know. I don't care. It's everything I want in a game.

But, there is one thing that is more ambiguous even than Zendo. If you've followed me the past year, you know what it is. 

The Decktet is the pinnacle of ambiguity in gaming, and perhaps my favorite gaming thing ever. 

Its creator describes it as "Perhaps, the kind of tarot deck they use in the alternate universe where Charlemagne was a badger."

That alone is sufficient to explain the ambiguity that is the Decktet, but allow me to digress. The Decktet doesn't exist in an alternate universe at all, of course; it exists in our own. Why would a deck from our universe declare itself to be from another?

The Decktet is ambiguous on all possible levels. Its identity is ambiguous [see above]. Its construction is ambiguous [is there an order, or isn't there?]. Its concept is inherently ambiguous [is this card's suit suns or moons?]. Its artwork is ambiguous. 

There is a card in the Decktet called "The Darkness". It is a completetly blank card. You see, you can't "see" the art in the dark. But, "no art" means a bright white card!

Nearly every card in the Decktet has two "orientations", both literally and figuratively. As you turn a card around, the right-side-up artwork changes from passive to active.

There is ambiguity of almost all other sorts in the art, as well. Is the lizard at the campfire by The Borderland's wall an outsider seeking entrance or an insider on a picnic of sorts?

Are the animals anthropomorphic, or are the people zoomorphic? Are the various "natural" animals [the tiger being fought in The Battle, the horse being ridden in The Journey] also "people"?

Is the Merchant buying goods from suppliers on The Market card, or is he selling goods to customers? There is not a single card in the Decktet with an airtight interpretation.

Then, there are the games. 

Ace Trump [among many others] allows you to break the cardinal rule of trick-taking: Follow suit, or trump? 

It answers "Well, do both."

My own game, Conundrum, breaks another rule, that of a hand or a trick "being in" a certain suit. In Conundrum, you don't know what suit a trick is or what suit is trump until the trick is over and someone wins it. 

In Bharg, you go out either by having everything "bound" in a set [which means basically that they share no characteristics: no suits in common within sets], or by having everything not bound [which means all the cards share a suit], or some combination.

And so it goes in all the Decktet games.

If you like the concept of "multi-choice cards" from Selwyth's board game taxonomy, the Decktet amplifies it exponentially.

It is one of few true gaming innovations.

---

Zendo is a game of deduction, although it bears precious little resemblance to Clue and its offspring. Those games feature lots of private information, used in service of shrinking down a known combinatoric set of possibilities.

In Zendo, everything is public. Every turn increases everyone's knowledge, but the winner is still the one player who can figure out the puzzle first. When played extremely competitively, this can cause problems, as players don't add to the public pool of knowledge. But the game is usually played in a spirit of cooperation that discourages this sort of interaction.

But the real feature Zendo brings is the deduction target. Rather than a simple combination of items (Mr. Green in the Observatory with the Lead Pipe) every game funnels into a rule, which can be as simple or as complex as players desire. The looseness of the game's competitive frame means that the difficulty of rules is somewhat self-balancing. Difficult rules will feature players working together; simple ones feature lots of competition.

The result of the fairly simple rules structure is an interesting brain-burner playable by gamers and non-gamers alike. It requires a different kind of thinking, and is definitely worth playing.

RATING: 5
Pattern deduction game that almost feels like a party game, if you are the kind of person with intelligent friends.  I liked that you are using binary yes/no grading in order to solve the rule.  Kind of like Mastermind.   Allows for some creative thinking, but the game state can be a bit fragile, where errors or poorly worded statements can ruin the puzzle.   Scoring system needs a major overhaul, as players get nothing for contributing significantly to the solving of the puzzle.  A case can be made that it is more activity than game.

I don't think there is another game quite like this.  One person (the master) comes up with a rule, and then builds two sets of looney pyramids, one set that obeys the rule and one set that does not.  Other players build their own sets in an attempt to gain information about and eventually guess the master's rule.  This is a wonderful way to help kids see patterns and is a hoot for adults as well.  I like it!

[10 plays] Though Zendo is inductive rather than deductive, it still falls into being the sort of logical reasoning game that I really enjoy.   

I also enjoyed the sort of semi-cooperative spirit of Zendo. And I guess the attitude one takes toward that could vary. It's a game where all of you are seeking the same goal, and only one will be first to get there. I could say that much about Sleuth or practically any deduction game. What's different in Zendo is that you are all working with the exact same information. Nothing is hidden. And I guess you could play with the approach that you're trying to help yourself without helping others--kinda like in Password where you hope to give a clue that will help your partner guess the word, but won't help the other team's guesser--by trying to construct structures that won't be evident to the others, based on how it seems they're thinking, and by being stingy and strategic about calling Mondo (which could allow others to get guessing opportunities). But that's not how I experienced it. It was more like a group effort--everyone doing their individual best to crack the code, but indirectly helping each other by drawing on each other's discoveries and contributions to the group's information. Kinda how I'd think of science--if you're an individual scientist, you're one of many who are trying to cure cancer or figure out what's going on on Neptune or whatever, and you're all building on each other's contributions to the common pool of knowledge. Sure, you'd like to be the guy who makes some amazing Nobel-prize-winning discovery, but even if you're not, what you're doing is still helping. Likewise in Zendo, it's optimal fun when YOU solve the puzzle and win the game, but it's still gratifying when someone else does it, because the group has arrived at the common goal we've been working semi-together toward. 

And then there's the role of the Master. I think the Master in Zendo is the closest thing I've seen in boardgaming to being the GM in an RPG. The students win the game when they solve the rule, but how does the master win the game? The master does not win, nor does he lose. It's not an adversarial relationship; as the master, you're not trying to create a rule too difficult for the group to solve. It would be easy to do that, but it would destroy the fun of the game. If you were going all-out to help the group, you could just tell them the rule; if you were going all-out to hinder them, you could make it near-impossible to guess. Either way makes the game pointless. What the Master is doing is what the GM does--you're setting up a situation in which the group probably should be able to succeed, but making it challenging enough that the journey will be interesting for them. 

In short, Zendo was awesome. I have to get a copy ASAP and play it obsessively. It has also heightened, if possible, my long-felt desire to play Queries 'n Theories.

[Induction, Abstract] This is not a style of "gaming" that I am fond of. One player constructs a puzzle, the others try to solve it. The vaguely Buddhist "theming" of the game isn't particularly useful for anything. I consider these kinds of things contests more than games, as there is no way to manipulate the game environment. All you do is collect information, there are no decisions involved. That last bit is why I find Zendo (and most other deduction/induction games) to be tremendously boring, and would easily prefer to watch a film or read a book.

Fantastic! It's not so much a game as a brilliant logic puzzle of inductive reasoning. It works amazingly well. While there is a "winner" in the sense that a player eventually figures out the secret rule, I'm much happier playing a few games of this in a row (staying as the Moderator or rotating) and enjoying each other's theories and congratulating the player who finally "got it".  It may be unfair to call a winner in this game as the players really do work together to try different theories, with each player learning from each other.  If YINSH is Othello on crack, then Zendo is Mastermind on crack.  Finally, a Mastermind-like game where it's actually FUN to be the code-maker and moderate each players guesses and help guide them towards the answer. As you read the Advanced rulebook (2017 edition) your truly release what a brilliant game this is.  Zendo is the sort of strange game that is so strange the rules actually manage to manifest themselves in interesting ways.  (Another strange game, Polarity, also pulls off this feat simply by the nature of the game being so out there.)  Anyway - Zendo is fantastic and I'm so glad it got a new edition in 2017.

I mostly hate "one person makes up something for everyone to guess" games because it seems so hard to make answers of the perfect difficulty-- they tend to either go way too short or way too long. But I gave this a shot because the Looney pyramids seemed neat, and a good source of interesting details.

But in fact, trying to dig into the unique aspects of the pyramids pushes you into ambiguous areas. What counts as "touching the table"? Is a pyramid lying on the table with another one nestled inside it "stacked"? And so on. I'm sure experienced players have rules for this sort of thing, but as a game-night warmup pickup game ("hey, come in and have a seat!") it seems to risk miring the group for way longer than hoped. Bleah.

Currently, I've only played twice, and that as Master. So I'm not sure what I'd actually think about playing it. But, honestly, the experience was a lot of fun. The pieces are pretty, and it's a real hoot to say, "Yes, student. That koan has the Buddha-nature."

I liked the idea of this game quite a bit, and enjoyed playing it. However, I realize that I would probably never actually get to play it. It is clever, and the inductive logic is fun (if you like that kind of thing), but it would rarely see table time with my group. I'm glad I played it once, but I can safely remove it from my want list.

We play this with the containers from Container and a few green/blue/black cubes pinched from elsewhere. Works admirably, lovely filler with plenty going on, and you can throw people in mid game which is super. Amazingly clean design, huge space to explore with so few rules. 

There is a risk the game can struggle to end if nobody gets the rule, but it's rare if playing with a master who is trying to make an interesting game rather than look clever. New boxed set adds cards to ease people into making interesting rules, and defines difficult levels, making Zendo more approachable.

Multiplayer LSAT.  Probably the best logic game/multiplayer logic puzzle out there.  This is not my type of game and I will probably never play it again, but I feel I need to give it a good rating because it is well designed and for someone who likes logic puzzles, this would be a big hit.  To me, it feels a lot like work.  Its only fun if you are high or drunk.  Otherwise, you are doing a logic exercise... which is work for many of us, not fun.

I love the way this game forces you to think in a way that no other game does. The pieces themselves are quite cool. Though Zendo isn't for everyone, it sometimes draws people in with its fantastic presentation. I'm a big fan and am always looking for people of the right mindset to really delve into this.

This fantastic game is in print once again! The 2017 edition is pretty much definitive, with well thought-out cards, and new shapes. The game is also much easier to explain now, with simpler wording and less jargon.

THE abstract deduction game. Make up a rule, let others build shapes and let them deduce what makes one shape correct & the other false.

Very cool game, you should however make sure that the rule you're making up isn't super complicated! Start with something very simple and then work your way up, otherwise players will get frustrated.

Sure the components look like they're from the 80s, but hey why not, that was the golden age of abstracts as if i remember correctly.

Addendum, these pyramids definately wouldn't mind an overhaul in design.

RATING: 10
This is a great little deduction/induction game with a lot of player interraction.  The game is easily implemented (as I have) with the Treehouse pieces and spare glass blots.  It is easily addaptable for family members and others.  Online BGG variations have used emoticons to beer bottles to play it!

Downside: You need to be very carefull in who you pick as Master.  They need to be able to "read" the abilities of their students.  Also, the Master is essentially a non-player as they are responsible for the scoring.  This is OK for some, but some players never wish to be Master.

The game Mastermind made 3D and playable by as many people as you want. Best to keep the rule something simple (ie: Must contain a blue piece, cannot contain a small piece, etc) which sounds easy, but amazingly enough people seem to want to overthink this game so it takes a while to figure it out anyway.

A very accessible logic puzzle and it makes great use of the pyramid-shaped pieces!

Zendo is one of the better Icehouse games that relies on a moderator (master) and inductive logic.  With the wrong group this game can fall flat, drag unnecessarily, and bore to tears.  With creative, energetic, inquisitive types - it's a riot.  Zendo also requires a pretty good master and a flawless rules explanation to avoid utter confusion.  Under the right conditions, I don't see ever turning this down.

Well, this is refreshingly different.  It can be a great group exercise in logic deduction.  I can also see it breaking down quickly if you have an inept master.

I actually enjoyed it very much and will probably pick up some icehouse pieces in the near future.  I do have to say I will strangle someone for the whole "at least..." and "exactly..." distinctions.

I like the theme/spirit of this game a lot. I don't even view it as an abstract. We play it as a co-operative type (1 vs. many) game where students are striving to "achieve enlightenment". Its uniqueness makes it a very welcome and refined addition to our collection.

*UPDATE* - unfortunately watching this one sit on my shelf for an entire year as many other games get called new and old i have to concede that, generally speaking, people aren't too excited by it.

Interesting, but I don't find racing against other players to solve a puzzle enjoyable if there's no conflict.

Nitpick. The words Quiz and Test are too similar, and my dumb brain couldn't remember what meant what, so I started using "Tell" and "Guess," e.g. "Tell me if my example follows your rule or not." or "I'd like everyone to guess whether or not my example follows your rule."

Close to being broken.

The range of valid answers to the presented puzzle narrows down very _VERY_ slowly.  After each clue/guess only a few possibilities are ruled out and a world of them still remains.  So - ultimately - the game becomes a festival of wild guesses and the luckiest players solves the puzzle...  Plain stupid - I hate it.

The best game to play with the system icehouse. Zendo is a game of inductive reasoning in which one person (a non-player known as "the Master") selects a secret rule that determines whether a small group of pieces (a "koan") should be marked with a black stone or a white stone. The players try to discern this rule by building koans and proposing possible rules. The winner is the first player to successfully guess the secret rule. Similar to Eleusis.

There's just something about this game that really grabs me.  I enjoy doing logic puzzles in Games magazine and such, so it's not really surprising, I suppose.  My mind just works that way.  I didn't even really notice the "brain burner" aspect of this game at first, because it didn't affect me.  Plus, with the pyramids and the Zen theme, it's just cool.  With the right group, there's a pseudo-cooperative aspect to the game (both between the master and the students, and among the students) that adds to the enjoyment.

When you are the master, it's extremely important to have "rules" that are appropriate to the players at the table, and the mood of the table.  If you have inexperienced players, don't make a hard rule.  Sometimes with experienced players, you all want to play a stupid-hard rule, but that's the exception, at least with the players I play with.  When in doubt, make it easy.  If the game ends too early, you can try again with a harder rule.  If you are an inexperienced master, you will probably underestimate the difficulty of the rule you are making.  Make it simpler.

I've played versions of this in the car (using words instead of shapes) and, years ago, in an internet chat room (using numbers).  The question is how much the various physical components here add to that experience.  The shapes and the card system are fun, and definitely help lessen the likelihood of the Zendo-killer: somebody choosing a rule that is much harder to induce than they realize.

Abstract games have to be very good to appeal to me and Zendo does. It is a very cool induction abstract game.

The rules are pretty easy to learn and teach,  you can do it under 7 minutes. Playtime is variable and it also depends on how hard are the answers.

Bottom line, Zendo is a good abstract game, perhaps my rating will increase with more plays and I would like to buy it.

A good game, but group dependent. I could see arguments, overly complex rules, or just irritating play if someone WANTED to break the session or just be a jerk (most gamers are not that way thankfully). This didn't happen in the games I played and we seemed to have a good time. 

Zendo is a great deduction game and it can be amazingly hard to come up with a rule! I got instant Zendo Block in trying to come up with a rule...thankfully the game had some cards with starter rules to build off!

Zendo also led to me meeting some great people at Geek Con 2006.

The game itself is out of print, but the rules are online and the playing pieces are still available and might make good stocking stuffers--hint, hint!   http://www.looneylabs.com/OurStores/product.html?ProductID=43&List=Strategy Games   I got 5 of the "rainbow stashes" (red, yellow, green, blue, and black) plus the Playing With Pyramids book and the Zendo starter cards, so I sort of have a copy of the game. I picked up the stones at Beverly's. Now all I need are some more rainbow and/or Xeno stashes (clear, cyan, orange, purple, and white).

Once I got the kids to play this, I almost regretted it--they kept asking me to play again and again and again...

Zendo is a game of pure logic and deduction. It can be played with anything but was published with ice-house pieces from Looney Labs. That boxed edition is long OOP but you can simply buy some ice-house pieces to play.

One player is the master and secretly writes down a rule. For example "There must be at least one red piece". They then set up two 'Koans' (a Koan is a collection of pieces) one which obeys the rule and is marked with a white stone and one which disobeys the rule and is marked with a black stone. The students then take turns making koans and trying to guess the rule.

When playing you have to constantly evaluate rule possibilities, determine which have been excluded already and construct koans to test those that haven't been. If that sounds like fun then you'll love this game!

RATING: 7.01
A good party game to get game night started.

I think it is best with 4 players (3 students, 1 master).

The core challanges of this game for the Master are:

a) find a rule that is tough enough to go around the group a few time (so that everyone feels like they have participated)

b) pick koans (either initial or counter-examples) that keep the game moving.  A 'simple' rule may prove difficult to guess if the koans available are relatively homogenous.


The core challange for the Students seems to be switching gears.  Start by varying patterns in the Master's original koans and then introduce Mondo koans that only help you.

Definitely one that you have to be in the mood to play.  I see it more as an exercise than a game, but for those that enjoy puzzles/logic I can see how they would like to play it more often.  As I use it to reinforce inductive reasoning skills in my math classes, it fits.  I find that the students enjoy it more when they're winning (like anything), and get bored if they don't get it right away.  I think the completely pasted-on theme is really amusing, I love saying "Buddha Nature".

Traded away, then reacquired in a math trade.

It's a very nice game for accommodating a large number of players. There's basically no player limit, and players can drop in and out of the game. Good for bringing to cons, as it allows you welcome onlookers into the game. Despite the nominal competition, everybody is more or less cooperatively solving a puzzle. Since the puzzle is created in the mind of one of the players instead of predetermined and written on cards included with the game (or something), the replay value is close to infinite.

RATING: 10
Deduce from my score that I like induction.

I rate this game so highly because:
 
(A.) I love induction/deduction.
(B.) Being abstract, it is pure.  There is absolutely no overhead (like Clue or Myster of the Abbey), it's pure gaming pleasure. 
(C.) It works as a low key game or a party game.
(D.) The ICE HOUSE pieces can be used to play other games, or (in the event of using M&Ms or other edibles) can be eaten.

The "Master" presents a riddle (i.e. contains one orange pyramid) making a right and a wrong example out of Icehouse Pyramids (though I have heard of others using M&Ms and pretzels); one has the puzzle's "Buddha" nature (marked with a white stone, meaning it has the solution in it) and one that does not (marked with a black stone).

Students take turn building structures as they narrow down the possible solution saying "Master."  If it's right, you get a white stone put by your structure, or black vice versa.  When you think you know, you build your guess and say "Mondo."  Secretly, all students hold up a white stone if they agree with your guess, or black vice versa. The "Master" does the same and gives a guessing stone to those whose hidden stone color matches Master's.  If Master's stone is black (meaning your guess was wrong), then he has to create a structure (or point at an existing one you overlooked) proving you wrong.  On your turn, you can use the guessing stone to formally declare your solution.  If you're right, you win.

Now there's no real pay-off in guessing before your opponents, and your guess can sometimes clue your opponents in and let them win...but it's a fun ride.  Not so much a game as it is a cerebral experience in reflection and frustration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Can be wonderfully engaging and really rewarding. Also can be very frustrating and annoying - depends on your ability to apply inductive reasoning, and also requires the Master to refrain from going to crazy with his/her choice of rule.

Can be very hard, even for apparently simple rules.  People get really into it trying to figure out the rule, which makes the game more intense than you'd expect. 

A select few people really get into theme, which makes it even more fun (but it's not at all necessary or all that common).  This is definitely a "brain burner" -- it'll tire you out.

No other game I've played attracts attention like this one. Play it in a public place, and strangers will come around and ask you about what you're playing.

RATING: N/A
Zendo is a game of inductive logic in which one player, the Master, creates a rule that the rest of the players, as Students, try to figure out by building and studying configurations of the game pieces. The first student to correctly guess the rule wins. Zendo uses Icehouse Pieces, but was released as a standalone game in July 2003.

One of the most innovative games I've ever played. Everyone says "oh, it's like Mastermind" at first, but really it's much deeper and more interesting, and building the little koans is a lot of fun. It's too bad that there aren't really any good two player variants, but everything else about this game is excellent.

Very unique game.  I have played this game both with and without icehouse pieces.  I like the game much better with the icehouse pieces as they have enough differences to make the game interesting while the similiarities of the pieces also put just the right amount of boundaries on the nature of the koans as well.

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed this.  The cards help you start out with easier rules, which is really good, because you REALLY need to use easier rules than you think.

I enjoyed this infinitely more than Queries n Theories, because with Zendo, we've never experienced much of a problem of the master making big mistakes, whereas with the latter, the master made mistakes so often that it made the game really not fun for anyone.  This game is just a lot easier to understand.

And it's still very hard for the people guessing!  Some little thing that you haven't been thinking about at all is the real answer...it really encourages you to think outside the box.

I don't think there's any other game that's really amazing for pattern recognition / the scientific method.

I think it might be better to just ignore all the mondo rules and just give each person one guess per turn.  There's very little incentive to not make each turn a mondo and you end up doing it even though you don't know what it is, just because some chance of getting a token is better than none, especially if you have none and your opponents have some.

RATING: 10
Pretty darn fun.  Lots of hard thinking.  The game starts a bit slow with all newbies, but picks up as you learn the flow of play and pick up on some of the solutions.

It's like Mastermind for grown-ups.

The "master" must be careful.  If he/she misses something then everyone is working on an impossible puzzle for 30 minutes.  Can be frustrating.

This game grows with you too, which is neat.  Start with the simple puzzles and gradually go with more complex puzzles (with ANDs and ORs for example)... gets to be a lot of fun

Created my own set using official cards now available and 5 Treehouse sets.  Also bought the "Playing with Pyramids" book and some stones.

Very nice inductive game.  I like thinking games. =)

I think I could play this game every day and not tire of it.  New people bring new rules and new challenges.  The biggest difficulty is in creating rules that are the right level of difficulty and complexity for a given group of people.  

Based on so many plays that I have lost count...  100+.

This is a good game if you are in the right mood. It's really quite puzzle-y, and you can have plenty of fun just creating rules and solving them without the actual mechanics of the rules.

The master and student roles are really QUITE different. Because I was the only one who read the rules, knew what was going on, etc., I was always the master. The first time I was a student was quite an eye opener -- it's HARD. 

Things that seems so obvious when you know the rule...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Zendo was one of the games that, just from reading the rules, convinced me it would be worth owning an Icehouse kit -- and it doesn't disappoint.

Two-player, simple: You could argue that when played this way Zendo is a puzzle or an activity rather than a game, but whatever it is it's fun. This mode makes me excited to try it with scoring. Just cracking the puzzle as the student is fun, as is coming up with counter-examples as the master.

It makes me feel dumb, but in a fun way -- for example, the rule "No green pieces" took me a table full of koans to figure out, even though in retrospect it was obvious.

As a game I'm not sure, but as a nice pastime that forces you to reason in a way that doesn't come naturally to most (people are to hard on confirming positives rather than trying to falsify). You'll never run out of possible Koans so this is certainly something you can have around without tiring of. Not something I'll play often but in the right setting this can shine! Trying to match the right difficulty is also a tricky challenge but oh well. Really a fun Mastermind on steroids that also works with multiple players!

Ah, an inductive logic game.  Geeking about logic itself is one of my personal little obsessions, so this scores high.  It can be slow moving, and a brain burner(particularly depending on how evil the player in the role of master is about choosing the rules), but it's a real good time when I'm in the mood for a brain burner.  Probably the closest thing to a true 'brain burner' in my list of favorites, so if I'm in the mood for that it's definitely coming out.

One of the top five games in the history of all gaming. Easily.

Zendo is the one game I think every gamer should know how to play. Is it about Buddhism? Is it about inductive logic? Is it about the scientific method? Is it about debugging computer programs? I, personally, would say "yes" and "no" to all of the above. What Zendo is really about is the union of Yes and No.

Zendo differs from most other logic games in that it is about figuring out whys rather than whats. The knowledge you are seeking to uncover in a game of Zendo isn't of a specific thing or even a specific pattern, but of a specific rule for judging other things by... more of a pattern generator if you will.

Unlike games like Mastermind that have fail-proof processes that, once discovered, can be applied to any situation [a very poor model of any logic problem you're likely to face in real life], Zendo is about discovering processes that can be applied to your particular situation. This is a real life skill.

I believe the world would be a better place if everyone knew Zendo.

This is a great logic game. The open-endedness of the buddha nature makes the game as unique as the person playing it.

A very good exercize in logic.

RATING: 9
Much more challenging and pleasing to the senses than Eleusis (the mother of all games involving inductive reasoning), Zendo isn't as well padded as a design, though: there are no limits or indications of the amount of turns or material (say Icehouse pyramids, if we want to keep colour, size, vertical and horizontal orientation as parameters), and the game depends much more on the good will of the master (there's no goal such as a score to drive him to pick rules of a certain quality).

So, while it can be a wonderful experience for the gamer, it can occasionally become very frustrating, especially when the pieces run out. Adding some rules for control would compromise its superb elegance, but it might make Zendo the ultimate game of its kind... (it might be already for fans of Nomic and other sorts of speculation).

RATING: 7
It's not so much a game as an exercise in puzzle solving, hoping you solve it just after the player to your right fails in their attempt. The 'master' comes up with a rule based on the shapes, colours, etc of the pieces provided, and players make guesses as to the rule, which the master proves or disproves by way of further examples. Guesses can be 'educational' with no points on the line, or 'committed' where everyone scores based on if they correctly state whether the guess is correct or not. 

The scoring in the original rules doesn't really work (1 pt for each correct committed guess, 2 pts for nailing the rule). In our home-grown variant, we say that all guesses after the first round must be committed to help chivvy things along. The latest version of scoring the master is they score the different between worst and best score - but that could change.

We occasionally play the game as a closer, but only when the right audience is around as some don't enjoy the process.

The weight can be light to medium, perhaps even heavier, due to the ability of the Master to craft koans targeting any specific difficulty.

Played again at GS11. I really really want to like this game and feel like I could like it and be good at it. But I am still really frustrated by it. I feel I may turn a corner on it soon and really like it. That is what I'm hoping.

And of course a big bonus is that you now have an IceHouse set and access to dozens of other interesting games on the net (HomeWorlds is especially recommended).

Excellent! A very unique, fascinating deduction game. Game can go flat if the master chooses a too-hard rule, but even then it's not so bad--the players can decide to just give up, and the game moves on to the next round. A single round makes for a good filler game, several rounds can make a good standard-length game.

RATING: 7
This logic/puzzle game is structured a bit differently than most games.  One player creates a puzzle in the form of a rule, and the rest of the players try to guess the rule by building structures and asking if they conform to the rule.  It's pretty amazing how challenging this can be, given the simplicity of a rule.  The game definitely encourages you to think in a way that not very many games require.  It's a fun exercise if you like logic puzzles, but make sure the puzzle-creator doesn't go overboard--it's easy to create a rule that will frustrate players indefinitely.

[original version] One of the best deduction style games. Interesting guessing mechanism, no downtime, and, most of all, lots of possibilities to get creative (and define your difficulty level). Some minor downsides: with more players there's some luck in the end (because you have to wait your turn); and the master has to grasp that harder is not always more fun.

A brilliant game. Thinking-intensive. For hard rules, we end up playing it almost as a cooperative.

A nice puzzle game. It is a good exercise for the brain and considering it is pretty much a multi-player solitaire, it provokes a good amount of player interaction and even cooperation. I especially enjoy it when I am the Master, watching others' brains burn trying to figure out the rule!

But beware this is the kind of game that people who have the innate ability for it will like it while others are likely to hate it. Other games with this characteristic that I can think of include Ricochet Robots and Set.

Simple yet very effective, Zendo is a great game.

This game is like a cracked out version of "mastermind" and I love it.  The free form open nature really helps things as well, as you really start to chew over the possible features and traits that could be involved in the rule.

I just play this straight up with the pieces and cards to indicate whether they follow the rule or not.  We let the master write their own rule so that they can get creative with what properties they choose to refer to.

A fun side story is that this game has helped to show me that most people don't realize that the number 1 is *NOT* prime!

A very clever enjoyable induction game. Like a game version of doing science, or debugging a program. (In a good way!)

Besides playing with pyramids, I have played it with colored wooden cubes, coins, words, and BGG emoticons. Zendo works with any kind of pieces, as long as you have some duplicates of each type.

The ability to play with a variety of pieces makes it easy to play in unexpected circumstances.  It's also useful to play in a foreign language to practice speaking about logical stuff in the language.

My favorite pyramid game, and possibly my favorite board game, period. I teach it to anyone who will sit still long enough to play it with me.

It scales very well to the experience of your play group, because a good rule can be as simple or as complicated as your group is capable of solving. Choosing an appropriate rule for a given group's experience level is a skill that takes time to learn, though, so your first few games may frustrate you unless an experienced Master is choosing the rules.

RATING: 8
There are so few Inductive Logic games, and when I encountered Zendo through Looney Lab's website and through Kory Heath's design narratives, I was compelled to try it due to its unique properties as a game. 

Zendo leaves a trail of koans and leads a group of people through a quasi-competitive trip from wrong assumptions to guesses at larger patterns. It's easy to go too far out in your guesses, but that's easily fixed by a kind master and a good teaching koan.

The pieces are beastly expensive ($40 USD) for their relatively middling quality, but you do get a great game for curious minds.

Looney Labs needs to go with/discover/manifest a plastics producer with more expertise; approaching The Lego Company's efficiency. That way, an elegant game like Zendo can better "approach" (need not adjoin) the market accessibility of a game like Connect Four.

Bought this recently. A great game that can either fill the void as a filler or a centerpiece of a puzzle/strategy oriented game night. 

You have multiple pyramids in 5 different colours, each of which come in 3 different sizes. You create a configuration / diorama using these pyramids and based upon a single logical rule, such as 'must contain at least one red piece' (more rules can be added depending on your group). The players use inductive reasoning to determine what the rule is.

Very fun for what it is.

I really enjoy playing Zendo, as both Master and Student.  There's something about it that just completely fits the zen-like theme.  As the student, the game can feel anxious.  But afterwards, it feels very peaceful.  Zendo is sort of a multi-player puzzle game.  It definitely works better with more people, but can still be played as a pure puzzle game with 2 people.

I assembled 5 stashes of Treehouse, 2 bags of Go pieces from a $3 Goodwill set, 1 bag of glass gems, and the official Zendo cards from Looney Labs in order to create my Zendo game.  I love it.

RATING: 6
An abstract game using the icehouse pieces (stashes): sets of 3 clear pyramids (in various colors) that fit into each other, small-medium-large (1 pip-2 pips-3 pips). One player is the Master, others are students? The Master creates a "koan": a configuration of pieces that follow a specific rule. On your turn, either "master" or "mondo". With one, you make your own configuration of pieces, and everyone simultaneously guesses whether it fits the rule or not (everyone has 1 YES voting stone and 1 NO stone). Everyone guessing correctly gets a green stone to keep. In the other option, you turn in 1 green stone to make a guess at the rule. If you're correct, you win! If incorrect, the Master makes a new koan: either one that fits your rule but not the Master's, or that fits the Master's but not yours. Play continues until someone guesses the rule exactly. The rules are initially simple (cards included in game; e.g., something like "1 red and 1 blue piece") but can get very complex with experience (e.g., "sum of pips is a prime number and at least 1 red and 1 blue piece, with exactly 1 piece lying flat").

It's actually a pretty good deduction - or should that be induction? - game, but I find the pace kind of frustrating. Especially with many players, it's a long time between your own turns.

RATING: 6
This was pretty much the only Icehouse/Loony Pyramid game I was interested in playing.  I'm not a big fan of any of Loony Labs' games but hearing Zendo described it sounded really cerebral and cool.

So how Zendo works is using these pyramids which are of 3 different sizes and a bunch of different colors you come up with a mental rule.  As a really easy example let's say your rule is that a "cone", which is what they call one setup in this game, must contain exactly two green pyramids.  Then you create two cones, one that follows the rule and one that doesn't.  The catch is that the rule could be anything.  It could have to do with the size of the pyramids, the count of the pyramids, where the pyramids are facing, whether they're standing, laying down, or something weird, etc.  So players start gathering information on their turns by creating their own cones and then asking to either be judged or take a vote.  If they are judged the game master for that round simply tells them whether their cone meets the rule or not.  If they vote all players get to make a secret vote on whether or not that player's cone meets the rule.  All players who guess correctly get a guessing token.  Finally when a player, on their turn, is ready to guess a rule they turn in one of their guessing chips and guess the rule.  If they are right they win the round but if they're wrong the game master has to create a cone that matches the rule but shows how their guess does not.

The game met my expectations in terms of how cerebral and cool it was.  This is indeed a  great use of the pyramids.  In practice the game didn't grab me like the explanation did.  Even rewriting the rules of the game like I did above the game sounds so much cooler than my experience felt.  In practice rules can end up evading players for way too long, which as the game master let me tell you makes you feel like you did something wrong with your rule by making it too complicated or obscure even though it might not actually be.  Or a game can be over in a flash when a player just happens to pinpoint the exact rule on their first turn, taking away other players chances to really get to "play" the game by mulling over the set of information they have.  I've played this game 3 times and one of those  two situations happened all 3 times so this is more than just an occasional problem.  I commend the design of this game but in practice, just not a great experience for me.

[Looney Labs 2003 Edition with box] {Abstract; Induction, creativity; optimal 5-6p} The gem of deduction game - unique and challenging. The free form of Koan is the cornerstone of this game, which makes Zendo an excellent logical deduction game. Those who like deduction game must own a copy of Zendo. It's a pity that it would no longer be sold. A good party game, nice player interaction. Also a good game for schools.

It's quite expensive if you want a copy of Zendo; however, you can buy several set of Ice Towers to play Zendo with lower price if you don't mind missing the beautiful box.

It's more fun in a large party where all players possess different kinds of mind. You can notice different behaviours and directions of thought. However, the fun depends much on the intelligence and altitude of the master. Well, I noticed that girls are usually better than boys in this game.

It's not an easy task to be the master: you have to tailor funny and challenging rules, to give out useful and appropriate hints, and not to leak information. Location, colour, quantities, relative positions, etc. can be used as the rule. Also, it's good to rotate the roles after several plays so that each one can be a master and student. Also, more pyramids can be added to Zendo to make it even more challenging.

I'd seen this game around on the BGG forums, so had a pretty good grasp of how it worked already (though I'd never heard the whole "Mondo" part). It's a quick and enjoyable little group puzzle-solving game. A cute and fun way to pass a few minutes.  Can be endlessly frustrating if the Master makes obscure or confusing rules, however.  Like teachers, I think there's a definite type of person who makes a good Master, and others who kind of muddle through.

This is such a versatile game! Excellent for children, of course, but also brain burning for grownups, with a good master. I also love how you can play this with just pen and paper, too, using numbers, letters, words, whatever!

Some comments from my playgroup: "It feels like I'm back at school - sitting at the back and feeling stupid." "It's not even a game." "Bleh, sounds awf... what, the Buddah Nature? I gotta play this!" It's not a game for everyone. Definately use very easy rules with new players. It can be fun though.

RATING: 7.4
I love this game, though it took me a while to learn to love it. It has an uncanny ability to make me feel really, really stupid though.

Update: There are clearly problems with this game. The master needs to understand that they are not competing with the students. Their role *is not* to make it as difficult as possible. I think I'd only ever play with rule cards rather than letting people make up their own rules. Even with the (unofficial Artscow) cards, some of the rules are either way too difficult (even playing on level 2) or we're just terrible.

Unfortunately, when we're all just floundering in the dark, the game quickly loses its appeal for me. Ideally a rule should be found after everyone has built 3 or so koans. Any more and it drags on (and you run out of pieces!), any fewer and it feels a bit pointlessly easy.

Rating down from 7.9 to 7.4.

Made my own set out of Treehouse sets and Go stones. Icehouse pyramids aren't the only way to go, but they certainly work well. Generally everyone I've introduced the game to likes it. But sometimes I hear, "I just don't want to think that hard. Can't we pick a dumber game?"

Clever. Sort of like 20 Questions and Mastermind combined. Of course the key is not to use any ridiculous rules that no one will be able to guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very fun logic game, but it seems that the difficulty level of the rule is very touchy.  If it's a little too easy, someone will guess before others even have a chance, and if it's too hard, players will get frustrated.

RATING: 6
This game is almost more of an activity, but still it requires a lot of thinking.  One person sets up some pieces based on a single rule (or maybe multiple rules), and the other players have to figure out what that rule is.  They can set up their own pieces and ask if it meets the rule of not.  Reminds me a lot of [thing=2392][/thing] where you test theory after theory until you can eventually narrow down the solution.  Good stuff.

Zendo is excellent, and it doesn't feel right to compare it to other board games... it's a shared exploration of inductive reasoning. That said, I find it quite exhausting and can only do so much (especially because rules that are even a little complex spiral out of control). That said, I think it is a beautiful game.

I am very stingy with 10's, since even my favorite games can maintain a minor improvement or tweaking. [i]Zendo[/i] is not such a game. It is a perfect, elegant game in and of itself that would not benefit from any tweaking or additions. It is a "perfect game".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great idea and execution.  It all comes down to the players.  If the master wants to make the game fun, its fun.  If the master is competitive with his rule, the game bogs down into the doldrums.  If everyone is a fun type player, I recommend this.  If you are considering playing this with competitiveness in mind, you should pass.

Its just a series of puzzles given to you by your fellow players.  A really nice social relaxing experience, with the joy of a puzzle to figure out.  Glad I played this one, as it is outside of my realm of the games I normally enjoy.  I also seem to enjoy deduction to induction, so thats a bit of a miss for me.

Doesn't score higher because it's a little too dependent on the skill of the zen master in devising entertaining rules. But once you understand that, it's fairly easy to give enough direction to zen masters to avoid disaster. So it's almost never bad, and sometimes great.

Zendo's one of my favorite multiplayer games. I'm a scientist, and Zendo is about the scientific method, but not only - playing it actually makes you *skilled* at the scientific method. It's also fun and addictive, rare qualities in a game with real (nay profound) educational value. I want more people to understand what a potent learning tool this game is.

Beautiful Ice House game, easy and fun to teach to new players, they always get a kick out of it.  Quite rare to find a copy of this game, so glad to finally have a real copy.  Can be created with TreeHouse pieces and counting stones, plus Zendo cards are still available though not even necessary.  Anyone can create an inexpensive Zendo set.  What a great game!

RATING: 9
Most innovative mind game combining both inductive (rarely) and deductive logic. Very good game system and naming of the game with a excellent matching of philosophical study. Fun to play as students. But also fun to play as a master to create rules. Highly recommend to people who like to use their brain. Creative and educational. A good tool to understand one's logic capability. Be better playing with smart ones. Note: master should not underestimate the complexity of their "SIMPLE" rules.

My favorite of the Looney Labs pyramid games (though it's not included in the new "Pyramid Arcade" set because the new version will have three different kinds of shapes and not just pyramids -- if you buy "Pyramid Arcade" you may still play the original Zendo game with it). Use deductive reasoning to figure out a formula/rule that applies to various configurations of pyramids. Version 2, with three kinds of shapes, instead of just different sizes of the same pyramid shapes, is coming out soon, and after playtesting it, I love it even more than the original.

Guy at work brought this to work for week.  It's pretty clever and fun little deduction puzzle.  I feel like some of the mechanisms in regards to scoring and such are clunky.  Having it be competitive kind of breaks the spirit of the game, which isn't really it's fault since I'm not sure that it's meant to be competitive... just even the nature of having to earn guesses feels off to me, it's really more of an activity unless a better game system can be made around it.

Outstanding deduction game. Unlike most deduction games, this one has lots of creativity involved. It's weakness is that it isn't great as a competitive game; it's more of a group activity than a true game. As a group activity it generates lots of exciting discussion and thought.

As an added bonus, a BGGer has shown how this can easily be used to teach the scientific method. Just replace "zendo master" with "law of the universe", "koan" with "experiment", and "koan has the buddha nature" with "experiment succeeds" and you have a game where players are conducting experiments to research laws of the universe!

Koan has Buddha Nature if: Pyramids form an enclosed area (atrium), each Pyramid touches a number of other Pyramids equal to its pip count.

Player interaction is high and game components are almost Zen-like. Rules are simple, making it easy to teach. The inductive aspect is enjoyable and coupled with the need to earn the green stones gives the game a nice twist. There is high replayability as it depends on what rules the Master can come up with. The difficulty level can also change based on the Master's rule, making it suitable for all levels and ages.

RATING: 8
This grew on me as we played it. It is one of the few games that I came away from thinking that I had spent my time developing a skill beyond social interaction with some real-world value, the scientific method I believe. I would love to play more of this, it really stayed with me for days afterwards like a good film or play will.

Perfect for people that like logic puzzles and stands in well as a small scale party game.

I'm rating here the various instances of the game concept (i.e. including the card game Eleusis). It's a brilliant game to teach and apply (inductive) logic, and even the post-game discussions (if the rule devised by some player was "fair" or "formally acceptable") are usually fun, and not annoying. The biggest qualms I have with the game are the relatively stretched out pace, and that the large freedom of deciding a secret rule can also lead to frustration in trying to figure it out. In other words, there's a bit of an asymmetry in devising rules that are (almost) "unbreakable" by the guessing players, I believe.

The concept of Zendo is not unlike a number of party games; however, with the visuals of the Icehouse pieces, it becomes an addiction.  I want to play it now.  The only fault I can find with this game so far is that it simultaneously wants to be competetive and cooperative, so the players feel a little weird about guessing and so forth, because everyone wants to be the one to solve the master's riddle.  This is the most singular game for Icehouse pieces I've tried.  Excellent.  If you don't already have Icehouse pieces, get this.  If you do, then play it, or even consider increasing your collection of Icehouse pieces and supporting Looney Labs some more.

After 20+ Plays: This game is incredible.  It is totally different from anything else I've played, and it really gets your brain working (it is amazing how many different aspects you can manipulate with such simple pieces).  The pyramids are just plain fun to build things with, and the game looks great with all the koans spread out on the table.  I also really like the interesting mix of competition and cooperation that the game encourages.

GAME: Continental Divide
RANK: 4547
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Continental Divide is a very streamlined railway game (just three and a half pages of rules) yet it asks some very tough questions at the outset:  what price shares in this new company and how many shares will it issue?  You want others to invest in this company and help extend it rather than wreck it, you want the company treasury to fund track builds, you want the dividends to fund share purchases, you want to visit lucrative eastern cities to build income, yet you also want to head west to unlock more track cubes and score vps.  Above all you want an edge over your opponents.  Shares score victory points for the company's progress across the board (an echo of Chicago Express), while the money that's essential throughout the game scores nothing.  As if that wasn't enough, there is also time pressure; Continental Divide is just eight turns long and the North American continent is wide.  This is a mean game and I like it.

As ever, Eagle-Gryphon offer a very mixed bag in terms of art and production.  The box and its artwork are splendid.  Then there are the cubes in muddy colours that are tough to tell apart in less than optimal light and the board whose art doesn't seem much improvement on the Winsome hex sheet.  The rules are clear and an easy read.

Make money to buy shares. But not that easy : cheap shares make cheap companies that doesn't build far. If you're alone, you have to do it all by yourself. Very difficult to find the right solution. A game that does not show all its depths in the first play.
Second play : better tactics, but still hard to win : I really like and hope this will be published by a major company.

I am fairly new to the genre and I got this for a good price.  At first glance this appears to be very sandbox like and freeing - you can choose what companies to launch and when, you can choose what price and how many shares there are, you can choose the start cities for a company and how they spread.   In addition you can go on the same spaces (not cities) as other companies so there seem to be not that much by way of restriction.  However if you dont send a company fairly directly westward you will run out of cubes, if you dont have both a high enough price per share and enough shares created you will never be able to pay the very high costs of expanding through the mountains in the centre....  As such the freedom is on a razors edge and unlike point salady euros its an edge that you could fall off.

Need the right group for this - ideally people who will play in away that avoids them being out of contension early and also not mind if they see that before the end they are no longer in the running.  Additionally people happy doing quick addition and division on the fly (or with spreadsheet) so the number crunching doesnt drag.

I like what I see though.  Also like the victory points instead of money condition as this seems a bit different and fun.

Initial rating (after 2 plays): 8.5

There are some interesting patterns and counter-patterns which I can see building up, which could prove to be amusing.

I am somewhat concerned by the general pattern of building up income -> building up points which seems to be at the core of the game, and is a game style I rather dislike in general.  There seems to be enough going on here to make the space interesting, however.

I am hopeful but mildly skeptical.  It is clearly Winsome's best since B&O.

I could see the score improving to upwards of 9.5, or declining as low as 6.0 with further play.  I imagine I'll find it about an 8 in the end.

RATING: 6.5
As might be expected from the B&O designer, turn order and timing are domineeringly critical.  Companies have fixed share distributions ranging from 3-10 shares, determined at the time they float, and are incrementally capitalised.  Capital control and capital flow through a company are a Big Deal -- with the easiest way to kill a company being to invest in it.  Company income and dividends are based on map connectivity, with increasing bonuses for westward progress, diluted by the total share issuance of the company.  This is balanced with variously severe cube limits, as well as a richly textured set of trade-offs between early money and long-term value.  The map is...delightful, and really is, as John claims, a significant piece of intellectual property.  The map is not the game, but the game effectively doesn't exist without the many value details that are embedded in the map.  Oh, and best of all, money is not VPs.  Shares are VPs as a function of their company's geographic distribution, again with increased early investment tending to reduce the long-term VP value of the company's shares.

RATING: 9
Note: completely provisional rating based upon one play.

A very intriguing Winsome--likely the best one I've played since South African Rails.  In fact, the game is probably better.  It feels a little like a "greatest hits" of all the Winsome dynamics I've come to love, except with little indication which ones are the important ones.  Everything in this game feels significant in the shape the game takes and the game space feels extremely broad.  The board is very pleasing with lots of interesting trade offs and room for sabotage.  Despite what appears to me to be pretty generous track building rules (up to three cubes on most track) the game can get surprisingly mean and its pretty easy to sink a company that has been floated low and with few shares.    

Update at 3 plays:
Man it's good.  Once the players get a sense of how the game operates and how the map will punish them the game really starts opening up.  It seems like though a cautious capitalization is possible, it's virtually impossible to push those lumbering "safe" companies across the US.  Instead the ones that demand the players over buy their shares seem to have a better chance.  This game takes the emergent alliances of other Winsome's to some very deep (and sometimes uncomfortable places).

Update at 6 Plays:
With the proper spread sheet this game can be played in a little over an hour.  Also, it's still totally brilliant.

Interesting game that seems to be the best Winsome release in a few years.

No luck auctionless stock/train game with simple rules but a map which provides texture and real decisions. Interesting tradeoffs of income vs. running for victory points. Trademark Winsome ideas of emergent alliances and potentially destructive stock purchases.

I watched the second play and am a little concerned that the parts of the game which interested me vanish once the players stop making all the rookie mistakes we made.

A calculator should have been included! (See Runkst's app) Overall I found this one a bit dry and the theme didn't come through strong enough for me.  Players' thin paper money is ignored at game end, no RR lines can build from California eastward and most games seem to always have transcontinental routes ahistorically hugging either the Mexican or Canadian borders (plus one straight west through Denver).  For some reason the cubes are rationed out (this is slow) and it's quite easy for a newby to pretty much mis-price themselves right out of the game, as the only really interesting decisions are how much to set the stock price at and the number of shares issued.  Due to cube rations and always tight RR track building cash on-hand each turn, the rest of the decisions are pretty straight-forward and predictable.

Kudos though to E-G for a high-value reprint, with a mounted board and nice share cards.  The cube colours are a bit hard to differentiate in low light - the brown vs the browny-maroon and the dark blue vs the black, but a nice plastic insert, colour rules and a concise ruleset were a help.  Although, I like economic games and I like train games, this one didn't do enough for me, as the convulted dynamic share pricing, RR income tracking (by easily dislodged cubes), and the onerous dividend phases became much too tedious.

I wanted to like this. It's bleak, harsh, unforgiving... the game does not hold your hand in any way. You can get screwed out of acting for several turns in a row if you're not careful, and it's not clear at first blush how to proceed. The math involved is opaque and the various charts not especially helpful. Honestly, if I could just remember how to evaluate the stocks, I'd probably be able to enjoy it. I would play again, but I'm not sure I have the group for such a thing.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Brutal, unforgiving, and a bit opaque RR stock game. Money is just a tool here - and is not the winning condition. VPs are acquired by owning stock in companies that earn points as they stretch across the map and sell all their stock. The stock price and amount of stock present decision is interesting. Turn order can be aggravating but can be used to time company openings and track spread later in the game.

RATING: 7.5
Very good train/stock game.  The limitations on building track make careful planning necessary and choosing how to price a railroad's stock and select the optimal number of shares is quite challenging.  I would like to try this again and see how differently it would play.

Ugh. Play American Rails instead.

This seems a lot more interesting than it is, but the limited cubes, fixed maps, and rules about only building in a straight line, and if you're the majority shareholder, mean it's going to unfold in a fairly predictable way each time. The rich will get richer and there isn't much of anything you can do about it. In an extremely crowded field there's no reason to make time for this one.

I like choosing the number of deeds available, and being able to start wher you want, but the negatives are many.  First, they didn't even bother to try with the map.  I know it is a hallmark of the company to make crap maps, and they seem to go out of their way to make them unappealing and difficuLt to look at as a mark of their disdain of the regular gamer.  Building in one direction is ok, but it leads to some very artificial and silly things like spanning the map in a tUrn, and totally coincident rail lines.  So, worth a play, but I think some more development on this one would not be amiss.

I have a love/hate relationship with Winsome games. I've played quite a few of them that were interesting, but I've also played a lot of them that were samey. They also tend devolve into tedious calculations to squeeze out one or two extra points at the end of the game. 

This one didn't feel too samey since when a company is started you get to select how many shares are available and what the starting share price is. That's sort of interesting. You also have to build in straight lines, requiring you to lean on your fellow shareholders for help.

Another difference between Continental Divide and other Winsome games that I've played is that there isn't an increased amount of tedious calculations at the end of the game. Instead, the tedious calculations hit you at the start of the game and never let up. Thankfully, there is an iPad app that will handle all of the calculations for you. Otherwise this game would be almost unplayable for me. 

The combination of tedious calculations and a boring map that sucks your companies dry, and I just don't find this game interesting. Part of the issue is that it may just be too opaque of a game for me to get a handle on. I felt like we just stumbled around for 90 minutes and someone ended up doing the math better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The board is hard to read, but the gameplay is excellent.  Players race across the western half of the U.S. as economically as possible.  The railroads always seem to be operating on a shoestring; but since more than one player may invest and therefore be eligible to lay track for a given company, there is a good bit of cooperation involved.  The other negative is the constant calculation of dividends to determine the current share prices.  If you don't have a math geek like me in your group, subtract one point from the rating.  

There are important strategic (how many shares for a railroad at what starting price) and tactical (how do I get across the Divide without blowing out my company's treasury) decisions.  As a final twist, money is worthless at the end.  Only the shares are valuable, and their value depends on how much progress the company made across the board.

The dividend calculations that some people complain about are not an issue to me.  My big problem with this game is the immense importance of turn order.  In particular, the player who goes last on round 1 (the only random element in the game) can have two consecutive turns while the game is still very young, which, properly exploited, can be enormously advantageous.  I'm sure it can be thwarted if the other players cooperate and remain on high alert for runaway leader openings.  I'm also sure that neither I nor my local friends are willing to keep playing a game that requires that kind of mentality until everyone reaches a point where it is no longer an issue.  My time is limited and so is theirs.  Onto the trade pile it goes.

Another very good Winsome game. Plenty of things to think about such as setting the number of shares and share price of companies acquired and interesting cube laying decisions. Game is about 2 hours for experienced players, but poker chips and a calculator, or better yet, a spreadsheet will save a significant amount of time.

--Feb2013-- Spectacularly brutal and subtle game.

This is one I'll buy immediately, if given the chance.

This is a streamlined 18xx, at least from the perspective of a non-18xx player. You float companies, issue shares, control companies, build track, pay dividends, etc. But the game plays much more quickly (only 8 turns), there's no annoying train-rusting, and you don't have to look for specific routes or deal with nearly as much math as 18xx! It was quite enjoyable, although it may be difficult to catch an early leader (not uncommon in the Winsome games I've played).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup
- Players each start with $240/n.
- All stocks/cubes are placed nearby (equal number for all 8 companies).
- Randomly deal turn order cards of one color; matching cards of the other color are placed nearby

In turn order, players may:
1. Buy Stock: of ONE type.
- if company already floated, may buy any number available:
... minimum price = stock price + income/shares (round up)
... place money into company treasury
- if company unstarted: 
... choose number of shares (3-10) in company, keep one of these, place the rest in company treasury, and remove any remaining from game; use a cube to show the number on Issued Shares on the track
... choose unique stock value ($10-50), and use a cube to show value on the Value Track; place cash in company treasury
... choose starting location on board; place a cube in one of the hexes of the starting cities
... place a cube on the 0 income space, and 12 cubes into available pool for that company
2. Build Track.
- for one company
- must be majority shareholder (or tied)
- build in a straight line, one cube/hex, starting from previously placed company cube; if cross into new region (start in Eastern; get to Central, then Western) immediately add 10 cubes to company treasury
- use only money and cubes in company treasury (cost shown in hexes on board)
- max 1 cube/hex/company, max 3 companies/hex; max 1 cube/company/starting city, max 1 port city/company, max 1 cube/port city
- add income indicated on all new hexes to Income Track; bonus $10 if crossing Continental Divide

After all player turns, bank pays dividend/share for all started companies (=income/total shares, rounding up) to all shareholders; any remainder goes to company treasury

If not turn 8, players choose new turn order in reverse turn order. Then repeat above.

After 8 turns, game ends. Players score VP per share. VP are based on:
- extent of track build (how far west company went, and whether it crossed Continental Divide)
- if it reached port city; bonus for SF
- bonus if no unsold share remaining
Most VP wins!

Continental Divide offers an enticingly simple final scoring:  each share is worth up to 6 points based on how far West its railroad expanded.  But everything leading up to this end is needlessly mathy with no increase in fun over the very similar Wabash Canonball.  Cash is worthless.  "Fixed" stock prices add an extra contortion with minimal benefit. The text on the board is too small for most grownups--and so are the million calculations.  This is an interesting title for rail elites only.

Continental Divide is a train/stock market game. There's a bunch of those out there so I'll focus on how this differs from other games in the genre.

First, players decide the starting prices and number of shares for each of the corporations. There can be 3-10 shares and the starting price must be between 10 and 40. This does put a bit of an burden on new players as knowing what number of shares and which starting price are appropriate is not intuitively clear.

Second, you are extremely constrained in how you can build. Each corporation starts with 12 tracks. If they build westward they can reach the central zone of the board which gives them another 10 track and if they build further westward they can reach the western zone which gives them a final 10 track. But if you lay more than a couple of track in any non-west direction you won't reach the central or western zone. So just about every placement must go west.

The cost for building in a hex is purely based on a value printed on the hex. There's no cost for other track in the area (although only 3 companies can be in a hex and only 1 can be in each port city). Your income goes up based on another value printed on the hex. Knowing the map and the distribution of these numbers is critical. It seems like there might only be a few paths that really make sense if you want to reach a port city (and you do).

Scoring is a bit odd for this game too. Instead of wanting money at the end of the game you're only playing for points. Each share is worth some number of points... 1 for each region it reached, 2 if it crosses the "continental divide", 1 if it reaches a port city (2 for San Francisco) and 1 if it sells all of its shares. Money is worth nothing at the end of the game. This means that unlike a lot of other games buying shares at the end of the game is actually usually worthwhile. It also means that building track at the end of the game might not mean anything (depending on whether you can reach a new zone/continental divide).

I liked that the game did some things differently than other games in this genre, but I really wonder if the set board values and the track contraint will force this game to play out much the same from play to play.

RATING: 7
Nice surprise. I was expecting to sell this off unplayed as being too heavy and opaque. But having no auctions, it was much easier to solo play (with some feeling of understanding what was going on) than German Railways or Texas & Pacific (i.e. Winsomes I've played with both auctions and a map).

Instead of an auction, the initial buyer of a given rail's stock gets to decide how many shares exist and a base price for purchasing them (to which will be added the amount of the current dividend payout). So, I suppose, you can still terribly miscalculate, but maybe fewer times? Additionally a player may buy stocks and build track a maximum of eight times over the whole game, as it's fixed to eight turns. This knowledge adds some needed clarity and structure for me.

I do sort of wonder how well one can manage to play-test a game where players have so much control over the shape of things, just by setting share counts and prices, possibly arbitrarily.

The "story" of the game comes from the great difficulty in trying to cross the "Continental Divide." It's very expensive and a given line may not be able to do it at all.

You win based on VPs calculated at game end. The lines themselves score the VPs (it's quite simple) and players multiply these scores by their stock holdings.

...I can't believe that this turn order mechanic is the best one possible. The player last in turn order has the ability to choose to go first in the next round (i.e. get two moves in a row).

This got broken out at a gaming meet up. Dry as a bone, lots of math. Thankfully the owner of the game made a spreadsheet to figure out the dividend payments and scoring. It was OK. I still don't really grasp it, but not entirely sure I want to play again to learn it better.

Haven't played this for years.  But what a great game.  Just thinking of it now I can just not remember the simple strategic truths of how to play.
Certainly a bad idea to play in any of the 3 squares next to a corner.....

In the category of classic abstracts, this is definitely one of the better ones. Thanks to the limited number of legal moves you have each turn, Othello is light enough for casual gaming. But still the game manages to be computational enough not to be easily solved or trivial. I reckon that if you play a lot, the game will become a bit repetitive, though. Hence, I plan to keep this for occasional playing only.

The rules are simple enough, but IMO not good as a game since the strategy is entirely and overly counter-intuitive.  It has the same problem as Monopoly in being a very passive game: often you'll be wishing that you don't have to take a turn, because the game isn't about making moves to aggressively attack your opponent and positively seize position, rather it's a negative exercise of denying safe moves to your opponent and trying to run him out of safe places to play in.

Some criticize Othello for having no strategy apart from "get the corners". Yes, the corners are extremely important. Nevertheless, I've seen games with experienced players where one player has held three corners...and lost! I also saw one four player game where one player held all four corners, and won...by a mere four points! There's more than just corners in this game, folks.

RATING: 5.7
Initial rating, based on playing twice. I suspect it'll go down and down with every play (probably ending around 5.5 or 6), as certain strategies present themselves as obvious and limit the viable game space. For the initial game, I quite liked it, but during the second game I already saw certain sequences repeating themselves as necessary given specific situations. Not nearly as mind-bending as Yinsh, but I see where the comparisons come from.

It's othello.  As they say, a minute to learn, a lifetime to master.  Well, maybe not a lifetime, but it you get the strategies down you will be bored in most cases as the general opponent will be slaughtered everytime.  I still am not to that point, but I wind up playing against a computer and getting my hat handed to me readily every time.

Box shows no wear, but dishes just a bit due to the flimsiness of the cardboard used on the box.  The board is in pristine condition, the pieces are still in their factory sealed plastic bags, and all three rule sets are present (English, Spanish, French).  The English rule set is a bit wrinkled.  Nice set.

Classic abstract strategy game, I played this a lot when I was a child but as a no brainer, only learned that the corners where crucial. Know I see more things I have keep an eye on.

I don't play it well, masters use to beat me hardly.

Played mostly in www.yucata.de

*update*

I don't know if this game is good or very fragile, big swings in scoring intrigues me, sometimes I'm loosing hardly and in one move I get +9/-8 and the scoring turns in my favor... I'd keep researching on this one, by now playing it online. In any case, it's a forgotten and, probably, underrated game. I'd buy a copy to play with my kids when they grow up.

Sometimes I play it casually on my mobile phone if there is nothing else to do, but it's not a game I would be particularly interested in actually playing h2h against a human - it's just not fun enough I think. There are LOTS of better games for 2 persons, but it is true that Othello/Reversi is a rather quick game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
*5* (Initial plays)
Abstract game with lots of strategy and critical moves. It's not very exciting. The gameplay is very simple and will favor whoever has the most experience. There's not a whole lot of fun with the game, but the last moves can win or lose the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another abstract that I just can't enjoy enough to want to play it.  I got it at a Goodwill for $1 as a nostalgia thing, played it once, and realized that one strategy (the "corners") is the only way to play.  Therefore, repetitiveness kicks in, and it becomes nothing more than glorified tic-tac-toe as you try to prevent your opponent from capturing corners rather than trying to get them yourself.  The winner is the last person to make a mistake.

I liked it when I was a kid and played it quite a bit.  As an adult that has played so many other games with so many other mechanics, I have decided to completely abandon abstract all-together.  They just aren't fun for me any more, when betters games like [gameid=15510], [gameid=18602], or [gameid=823] are out there to be played.

Othello is a classic two player game. I grew up playing it so I do enjoy a game now and then for nostalgia. My husband on the other hand is not a fan so this one does not get played as often as our other two player games.

Players capture the opponent's pieces by enclosing a row, column, or diagonal set with their own pieces.  100% strategy, 0% luck.

I like Othello. It's just a game I don't see playing too much everyday. I'd choose chess or go over this game anytime if I were to play an abstract game.

Nonetheless, the game is enjoyable and like go, players can suddenly turn around the game with one cutthroat move.

A classic game that you can learn the rules of in just a few minutes.  I will give it credit for that.  However, I stink at this game and it is not fun when you're far behind.  Sometimes you know who will win way before the game is over.  It is a solid game idea, but can be very dry.

I haven't played this classic for a long time, but it is an interesting concept and mechanic (borrowed from Reversi) of 'trapping' your opponents disks and turning them to yours.  I never feel like I can see my best move and just never fully enjoyed this game.  It's good for kids to learn - much easier than chess but just as challenging to win.  Fine game. But I am not a fan.

Simply an ok abstract game. Getting to the edges of the board and securing them seems to be the key, as is forcing your opponent to place pieces when and where they don't want to.

Given the number of fantastic abstracts that have been released in the past 20 years I am hard pressed to become excited about this, but it is solid.

RATING: 5
Othello is quite abstract and offers quite a lot of variety despite its simple rules and standard setup. Unfortunately, everyone knows the tactical ground rules (corners first, edges second, and then see what you can do to annoy the other), turning a match into a very defensive business. Fortunately not as bad as Abalone, but still. With the arrival of the much more fluid and better-balanced Yinsh, I never play Othello anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
For some reason, I've always hated Othello.  On some level, I can appreciate it for being a very elegant and attractive-looking abstract, but I find it extremely frustrating to play.

RATING: 6
One of the first, strategic games I ever played as a kid.  For that reason only, I hold on to this classic.

When I first dug it out of the parents attic (where it had been for 25 years) my kids said "Oh, it's Reversi!"

RATING: 7
Simple, but takes practice to get really good at.  Knowing when to strike, and finessing your way to corners and edges as opposed to finding the spot that gives the most flips per turn is necessary for victory.  A unique territory game in which the more your enemy surrounds you, the stronger your position.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a classic game of strategy. I'm not sure I'd actually played with the correct rules before 2010... 

In any case, I feel like connecting my initial moves with the final arrangement is more of an effort than in Go. 

Though I can rarely work out more than a few moves ahead I can absolutely see the strategy of trying to withhold sides/corners whilst obtaining those positions. But it still feels less intelligible. Maybe I haven't played it enough. I guess I'll play it some more, specially since J enjoys it so much.

Sandwich a line of your opponents stones between two of your own and they become yours. Simple, right? However, I've never been good at Othello/Reversi. The negative feedback confuses me and I'm little better than a random player. Thankfully for my ego the general consensus is that the game is not well balanced. I know that the corners are important but I never know how to get them. Perhaps one day I'll understand the strategy/ develop some instincts about good play and come back to this game. For now, though, I can't think of many games I enjoy less.

Originally known as Reversi, it was reimplemented as Othello.

This is a great two player abstract game.  It is pretty cheap, and can be bought anywhere.  It is fast to setup, doesn't take long to play, simple rules, but with a lot of strategy to learn.

I had not played in awhile, and after I discovered [gameid=188], I hadn't played it becasue I thought it was an inferior cousin.  But having recently played it again, this is a good game in its own right, and I like playing this with my family.

I'm pretty sure I own a complete version of this.

RATING: 3
I used to play this a bit on my Gameboy, which also had Checkers and a bad Chess AI (I knew it was bad because I could beat it).

The Reversi AI started off very frustrating because I would lose horribly to it, but then I started to pick up its tricks and beat it consistently. I have since forgotten all that expertise.

Anyway, the game is apparently deeper than Checkers, shallower than Chess, and more difficult for humans to play than computers because of the difficulty of visualising all the flips when performing lookahead.

I'd rather not study a game where computers do better, and not play a game about hard to visualise lookahead.

It seems that most moves in the game are bad for you.

More fun to play in-person with real game than on the computer.  Still think so after a face-to-face game on laptop.  The real game is alot more fun.  Played it again using the "Go" board and pieces.  Interesting, but not sure if I'd want to repeat the experiment.  Went back to playing this the normal way (4-23-2011) with Mr. Billington and won.  Found that you can play in such a way as to force your opponent either into sacrifice (unavoidable) moves and/or forfeiting their turn.  I went from thinking I was losing and not minding too much to overwhelmingly winning.  Weird (but educational) game.  Finally played this with Mr. Billington again today (10-15-2011), modifying the variant of black disk in each corner, using this setup instead:  put the black disks in the opposite corners to the white disks in the middle, and the white disks in the opposite corners to the black disks in the middle.  Black goes first; I lost as white, but it was a good game to lose.  Might want to try this variation again, but reversing the corner disks (black-to-white, and white-to-black), to see if that's also interesting/challenging.  Tried same variant today (12-31-2011) and lost again.  Apparently I do better when there are more options to choose from than when there are fewer options to choose from.

RATING: 6
Looks like Go. Not Go. However, there are some similarities. Like Go, it has simple rules, fairly deep game play (though not as much as Go), and it's often difficult to discern good moves.  Oddly enough, expert players don't usually dominate the board until the last few turns.  So if it looks like you're winning, you're probably not.  At least in Go, you can tell who is winning.  I'm not calling it a flaw. It's just an odd gameplay element.

Over the years, I tend to care less about winning or looking smart (and a good thing too with the smarties & good gamers around me). So, this game doesn't do it for me any longer, which is true for most abstracts now.  My son likes it though, so it stays for the moment.

Have never really been a fan of this game as it seems too dry and too limiting (16/12/08). UPDATE: With the amount of board gaming choices on offer, it is clear I would never actively suggest this game.  I realise that unlike checkers, the game is yet to be solved, so there should be endless variation. But it is simply too dry, and depending on the pieces, a little too fiddly (Rating still 4 - July 2013). UPDATE 3SF 4.652 Jan 17

Take the corners, blah blah. I always found this abstract a bit bland. Go is so much better if a little longer, and the Gipf games surprise me more (in a good way). Not bad, and I proably just scracthed the surface because I'm really not very good at it, but it just doesn't capture my imagination.

Othello is the new commercial name for the Victorian game of Reversi, and is one of my personal favourites.

I played Othello with my 6 year old daughter, I gave her a nice handicap and then played without mercy. The next day she was trying to play with the 3 year old, but she didn't want to
teach him the rules so he wouldn't beat her.
He wanted to, but this was no way for him to play. So I sat with him and played "Let's Make Oreo Cookie Sandwiches", he was supposed to make cream sandwiches with cookies inside; I was making cookie sandwiches with cream inside. He enjoyed himself immensely, he even told me "what a beautiful game this is!" while playing.

This is a good looking abstract game, but I always feel that it lacks something.  There is a strong dependance on turn order, and experience makes a huge difference in play.  While it is quick to play, I find I just don't care for it anymore.  I see it as basically a kids game.

Rating for nostalgia.

In my opinion, one of the great, "classic" abstracts of the 20th century.

However, the "minutes to learn, lifetime to master" aspect groups this with chess, go, and shogi. It was fun to play a number of times, but I quickly grew tired, as good opponents are hard to find, and it takes too long for new-comers to pick up. Plus, I don't want to devote a lifetime studying this either. There are simply far too many boardgames out there with more social interaction than a head-to-head cranial exercise.

RATING: 7
An abstract that's accessible to anyone and light enough to be enjoyed. The corners are a bit too powerful (try a board shape that cuts them off) compared to everything else, so play centres around not giving them away. Works well with children in that there's little sense of winning or losing before the end.

I had this game about 25 years ago.  Now I've got about half the pieces and no board.  I suppose I should trade out the stray pieces to people who are missing one or two.  It was the edition from the late 1970s, whatever that was.

RATING: 6
An unexpectedly deep abstract strategy game, but a little too abstract to be truly alluring; being 2-player only also reduces the chances it will see play with me.

RATING: 9
Reversi is one of those all-time classic abstract-strategy games. I've only gotten "into it" a few years ago, but once the concept of how to play this game "clicked" in my mind I went and played with a passion like few games before. What is probably the most common version, Othello, states that it is a minute to learn and a lifetime to master. Well, it takes more then a minute to learn, but once you figure out just how to flip those pieces over, rather then just why they flip over, it suddenly takes on a life of it's own. I have yet to get tired of it, and I am getting better all the time.

Othello is always on my list of favorite classic board games. Simple to learn, hard to master. It's real easy to get your rump handed to you if you're not paying attention. I've always enjoyed Othello (aka Reversi) and I don't see that changing anytime soon. More accessible than Chess, but just as fun! The pocket edition is perfect for travel in a bag or glove box, so there's no excuse not to take it with you on a trip.

Othello can be a brain burner, but there are general tips (get the corners, get the edges, etc).  Sometimes lends itself to AP.  When first playing, beginners often try to snowball their captures.  I like this game as a welcome diversion and a good cognitive exercise.

This game can really be played with younger kids as long as you don't go hardcore on them.  It can be played with adults as well--very good age scalability.

Othello is more rewarding than fun, in the sense that it's nice to see a plan executed over the course of a game come together at the end.

Decent abstract - I played it a lot with my sister growing up.  I would never think of playing it now - with choices like Yinsh, Othello is just not very attractive.

RATING: 7
A lot more than meets the eye.  On the surface it's a simple game, but there is a lot of depth, and I like how the strategy is very counter-intuitive.  You're trying to have the most discs flipped to your color at the end, so you might guess that flipping the most discs each move would be optimal.  And yet, the opposite is generally true:  usually you want to have the LEAST number of discs flipped, as this gives your opponent less options for each of their moves.

My favorite of the classic games. Unfortunately it falls victim to the 'no one will play it with me anymore' category so I haven't really played it for many many years. This is one of those games that upon first play you will not grasp the complexities. Like 'Go' it can be played simply but over time patterns and strategies begin to emerge. I thougth I had it all figured out until the www came about and I found out about the world championships and the strategies they used there... suddenly I felt like a beginner again.

Really not a bad little abstract, with fair replay value.  It suffers badly in comparison to its ancestor Go and its rambunctious offspring Yinsh, however.  If you haven't played either of those games, Othello is worth a few plays.

On the rare occassion when I can get the wife to sit down and actually play a game with me, this is the one she prefers.  She's pretty good at it, but I still manage to win 2 out of 3 times.  That means it only gets played a couple of times a year.

1 / 5 - Bad.

My poor rating for this is influenced by the fact that I totally suck at it, even more than I usually do at abstracts. And I don't like abstracts in the first place. It doesn't help that it's easy to completely ruin a game by not spotting all the possible "flips" after a given move.

This is one of those games in which, at some point, it becomes obvious who has won or lost long before the last piece is placed. In such games I prefer to concede and fit in another play, but my girlfriend likes to play to the end.

"Let's just see how it turns out," she says.

01/26/2013: Players take turns placing one of their colored discs to the 8 x 8 grid.  Any opponent pieces that you surround in a row (your color on each end) then flip to become your color.  You go back and forth until the grid is filled.  The player with the most discs of their color wins.  It's not a bad game.  There is some strategy and tactics involved with where to play, but only after about the halfway point.  By then, the board is starting to fill up and you need to pay attention as to who is getting the edges and especially the corner spots.  It's a fairly light abstract game that can be played by all ages.

Really not crazy about Othello, but I&#039;ll give it a 6 rather than a 5 because there&#039;s no luck, and if one were interested in figuring out the strategy, that&#039;d probably be worthwhile. Many other abstracts I&#039;d rather play.

*Yawn*. A classic, definitely, but also a very boring classic. If I want an easy-to-learn abstract, I've got Dvonn (Actually, Yinsh is even better as it has some features from Othello, and is a lot more interesting). For more serious pursuits, there's Go. That's pretty much all I need.

Avoid.

Don't get to this much anymore (for a game in this vein I'd rather play [i]Yinsh[/i]), but I'm still glad to have a nice Gabriel edition in my collection.

A classic game of positioning on a grid, where enclosing the opposition on both ends of a straight line will see their pieces flipped to your colour to join your side. When the grid is full or a player runs out of pieces the game is over and the player with the most pieces of their colour showing wins.

Not bad for its time but there are much better abstract games out their now like Hive and Go beats this by a country mile.

If you like counter-intuitive abstract games, Othello could very well fit the bill. But at this point, everyone has probably played it on a computer form at some point and already developed an opinion on it, so I'll just put it alongside the other abstract games that didn't grab me strongly enough for me to want to dig into them. Despite its age, I personally feel like this one has been designed for people to devise solving algorithms rather than for humans to play it.

Othello is one of those meditative games kind of like Mancala.  The rules are simple.  The pieces are simple.  The set-up time is nil.  And the strategies aren't so complex.  It's an abstract, but not an abstract that is ultimately worth a _lot_ of thought or worth getting too worked up over.  This makes it a great game-as-social facilitator.  I mean, if you've got a kid that you want to simply chat with, Othello ain't a bad choice.  It's all about process.  I went through phases of playing this game as a kid, a twenty-something, and now as a dad, and I'd say it has had the same level of fun each time.  That's no small feat.

Old, classic game, but the enjoyment factor wasn't there the last time I played. Sure there is lots of tension as players migrate towards the corner, force your opponent to play where they don't want to, then voila! Different, I would prefer to play other abstract games than this one.

RATING: 7
Classic abstract game in which players try to conquer the most spaces of the board by a very original mechanism involving pieces with one colour on each side: in each turn a player places a piece on a square of the board with their colour showing up and turns all adjacent pieces with the enemy colour up that have been "sandwiched" between the piece just played and other pieces of your own colour. Excepting the first moves each move must bring at least a capture.

The idea behind the game is absolutely brilliant and the play is consistently thrilling but after several plays it's easy to suspect that in the end what really matters is who gets first to the corners of the board.

A simple abstract with little depth.

Noteworthy as the most common game in second-hand shops here in Melbourne, and therefore a good source of B&W counters which can be repurposed. The boards - not so much...

Very nice strategy game!  Things can "turn around" at any time!  (sorry couldn't resist!)  Just when you think you've got the majority of your color, one silly move and your opponent has the board covered in his color!  Go for the corners first!

I play a game with my Othello set that apparently isn't actually Othello. I picked up a set second hand and got the rules for the version of Othello I play in a pen-and-paper game book.

It is, however, similar to actual Othello in terms of play style (i.e. pieces constantly switching between white and black). I must do a post in the forums some time to ask what game I am *actually* playing :P

A classic game of piece placement. Cause you opponents pieces to flip when your pieces are at the two ends. Most pieces on the board at the end wins. Simple yes but fun, not really. Once you have played other games you notice how bad this is. Getting the corners is your main objective as they can never be flipped by your opponent, same with edges which are saver than pieces int he center. There are much better abstract games out there.

Forget who says: "just take the corner!". First of all, this is completely WRONG, second, if it was not, well, ok, then I can say about chess: "just promote a pawn to a queen!". There's WAY too many other things to consider, regular world championships are held since 30 years and competition is really high. On the other side, you can play it as a light game if you want, much more than other games like GO and CHESS.
Strategy and tactics are well balanced, the game is quick enough, complexity is at the good point.
A complex theory has been studied for this game, let me suggest to read something to understand the depth and beauty of this game, before starting; there are a lot of theory courses on Internet. There's not only "eat a lot and take corners", and even this idea is often wrong: you should care a lot for mobility. Other concepts that are touched by theory are unbalanced edges, parity and stable discs, that require a little bit of study. Only then you'll discover that Othello has a lot to tell you, this is not just a quick mind puzzle, it's a game that gives its best after some study, in competitive tournaments. So, don't pay too much attention to what is written by occasional players, if you really intend to find a great game that lasts for all your life, this may be the choice, if you don't want backgammon's dice, you don't like checkers and go and chess are too complex and too slow for your like.
Othello/Reversi is the best game ever invented and I'm not scared to write this. I own a dozen of different boards and still I'm not tired of playing it with friends or in tournaments, and I've played more than 20,000 games, right now. Find another game that permits you to play so many games without getting bored..!

One of those completely logical games which still manages to frustrate because people insist on making illogical moves.  Eventually, as the board develops, one is left with that 'juggling-too-many-eggs' sensation which led Sherlock Holmes to declare that chess was an inferior game because it simply required that you bamboozle your opponent with the complexity of the system.

The classic, 2-player abstract strategy game. Much better than Checkers but not as great as Backgammon. Not as sophisticated as Go nor as pretentious as Chess. Not sure about the "minute to learn, lifetime to master" moniker, but still worthy of periodic play. A good "starter" game for much better abstract games. I like Mattel's recent edition that has velveteen playing surface with recessed "dimples" on the squares for the tokens. Avoid "Reversi" as it's the cheaply produced knock-off of the name-brand original.

Simple nineteenth century abstract. Players alternate placing a counter. If there are enemy counters between the counter they place and other friendly counters they are flipped.
Though less complex than Chess or Go it is an interesting game. its most interesting aspect is that though you want to maximise the number of your counters this is often achieved by minimising it during the game.

Enjoying Othello as a (fairly) deep game will require some commitment.  It took me some time to overcome my own bias and see what clever things lie beneath the surface.  Most players go through two stages of learning.  Stage I: Whoever gets the first corner wins.  Stage II:  Whoever controls the edges wins.  Players who progress no further in their development can come to the conclusion that there's nothing to the game, and your ability to win is due to luck (whose pebble will make the tub overflow?) or an astonishing ability at reading-ahead.

Neither assessment is correct.  At higher levels, it seems to me that Othello is like laying mousetraps in a small room.  There are a wide variety of traps that can be utilized, and each trap will require very particular (often subtle) circumstances in order to be sprung.  So you and your opponent try and make dangerous areas for your opponent all over the board, while at the same time trying to cordon off some safe space for you to play when necessary.  The corners and edges, while still important at high-level play, are often poisoned, so that play at corners/edges is often not the best move.  Throughout the game, you are gingerly walking through a minefield, trying to add yet another trap to the room.  With good players, one trap springing sets off fascinating chain reactions.  SNAP!  SNAP!  SNAP!  Yow!  I hope your fingers didn't get caught.  

There is a very good game here once you move beyond the "get the edges" stage.

There is nothing in my being that would find enjoyment out of flipping disks.... I much rather prefer pushing cubes =)

Visual Appeal: (2)
Nothing fancy. It's just white and black chips.

Components: (3)
The chips hold up nicely and feel nice in the hand, but the light felt covering on the board is starting to wear away. 

Theme: (0)

Learning: (5)
This takes no time to teach adults and minimal time to teach kids. The strategy is like most old abstracts and revolves around spotting the best decision in the moment.

Gameplay: (2)
There isn't much diversity to this game. Place a chip, flip some chips, repeat. It is difficult to form long term plans or predict your opponent. Usually it is best to focus on finding the best move in the moment.

Overall Fun: (3)
I used to play this game with my grandfather. It was probably the first abstract strategy game I played (not including Checkers). I still enjoy it every once in a blue moon, but I much prefer newer abstracts with more difficult decisions.

Decent abstract with a good handicap system. More tactical than strategic, though.

If you like the sound of Othello, pick up a copy of Yinsh or Dvonn instead, as they both do the same things much better.

Is this one of those games that people complain about being 'solved'? It certainly has puzzle qualities, it may be solvable, but I certainly enjoy playing it casually from time to time. A good one to play with kids to teach the important concept that what looks like avery good move in the short time can actually be a very bad move indeed.

Challenging abstract strategy that is quite heavy on tactical play but unfortunately can be quite tedious and frustrating as a result.

To avoid "analysis paralysis" we often play with a timer - it certainly causes the game to be quicker, which in turn causes it to be more fun and exciting. It's the only way I'll play now.

Neat abstract, you try to have the most tokens on the field in the end, you switch the opponent's tokens by having on of yours on both ends of at least one (or ideally) more of the opponent's. I am not the biggest fan of abstracts, you need logic which I have little of, and quite often one mistake loses the game no matter how many other smart moves you make. For me, just alright.

{Abstract; area-control} The childhood mind game with my sister and family.  Othello is not very deep but it's still a good game to train children's intelligence because it's easy to plan for 8 steps or more.

This game has two outcomes, either it is a really close game where each player keeps up very strategic play, or a slaughter where one player makes the one crucial move and the other falters once and from then on the game is over.  It is a fun abstract, I like the piece especially with a nice felt board, but often times, you can screw up just once, and not even known where, and the game is basically lost to you from that point on.  It is fun, and it will get you thinking, but when one guy slaughters the other guy, it can be a little harsh.  fun though, and relatively quick, maybe an hour.  More if you're playing intensely.

I liked othello a ton as a kid. Go is a better version of this game.

One of the best games you can buy in a typical toy store. Flipping pieces lends a wonderful tactile pleasure to the game. The deeper strategies are also worth investigating. I'll gladly play.

It's interesting to note that the public domain version of Othello, Reversi, differs only in the initial placement of the center four pieces. What's more, skillful Reversi players evidently consider it poor strategy to arrange your initial pieces in the cross pattern mandated by Othello!

For some reason, I just don't like playing Othello that much.  I think it probably has to do with the fact that my sister used to trounce me at it every time we played, and I haven't improved much since then.

Have played it for years on and off.  I remember programming it on my 'Oric 1' computer in the early 80's.  I didn't appreciate it then, but as I grew up learned to love the game.  There is a technique which usually allows you to win a game.  But when to people of similar abilities 'clash' you can have a good contest on your hands.  The game allows no procrastination, and a successful player looks 2 or 3 moves ahead.  A successful opponant looks ahead one more!  It has a nicely designed board and pieces that allow them to be easily flipped.  Quite cheap nowadays making it well worth it over other more expensive games in the genre.

RATING: 7
[Rated 2005/12/05, based on 8 plays]

(On-line plays logged, many more plays as a kid)

I'm rather fond of this, both for nostalgia and for the fact that it's still quite an interesting mental challenge in its own right.  More to it than there looks, and certainly more strategy than I ever remember thinking about as a kid.

I love Othello, but I like other abstract games better, so this one doesn't get as much play.

(This may also be because I used to play it on the computer. I got quite good, but it makes playing a real opponent less interesting for both of us.) It suffers a lot if the players have different levels of experience.

Wow, definitely not what it seems to be. Frustrating for a long time, things changed dramatically, when I read two excellent ebooks, which you can download for free (one written by Brian Rose, the other by Randy Fang). Make also sure, you download wzebra, a freeware program which is an excellent tool for practising and analysing (but the most enjoyable part is certainly playing against humans, since computers play incredibly strong, even in lower levels of difficulty). One of the most difficult problems for a beginner (I'm no expert at all) seems to be the evaluation of a position. Furthermore it needs some experience to distinguish a good move from a really bad move (not even taking into consideration the task of finding the best move in any given situation). but once you have taken these initial hurdles, you will realize how original and challenging Reversi is. Another big plus is the moderate playing time.

I think this game would be much better with a larger board.  The strategy isn't "deep".  The small board size forces you to familiarize yourself with all the edge conditions, and this takes practice.  It's not my idea of fun.

This game was the BOMB when I was a little guy.  Then I discovered the corner strategy and vanquished all my little friends.  Then my little friends discovered it, too.  Then we realized that player order determines who gets the first corner.  Then the game broke.  I haven't picked it up since.

For a less constricted game, with more middle game, play on a 10x10 board.  Classic 8x8 othello sometimes goes directly from memorized opening into endgame... especially with the extensive computer-generated opening theory that's easily available.

RATING: 5
I did my senior Comp Sci research project in college on this game and I still am terrible at it.  Remarkably deep, like its cousin [gameid=188].  Great if you can find a regular partner at your skill level.  Much like all the good abstracts, there are principles that you will slowly discover, exploit, and then internalize.  This game doesn't get enough credit, in my humble.

A good game to teach kids strategy. After enough plays the game devolves into a larger version of tic-tac-toe in that I can spot the mistake by my opponent that leads to my winning the game. If they are equally skilled the game will be won by the player moving first.

This is a game that I don't really get. High levels of play seem to avoid having any sort of board presence in the early game so that you can have a couple of big turns in the last few turns. This feels very counterintuitive, and I'm not sure I really enjoy it. Still, I don't understand it very well at all. Part of me thinks that if I took the time to study this game, I would enjoy it more.

I think I would probably like this more if I hadn't played Go first. To me, it feels like a watered-down version of Go. I also have a harder time seeing the board position in this relative to Go, so that could be part of why I like it less.

TRADE INTEREST: VERY HIGH

A 2 player, abstract strategy game with no luck where each player on their turn will play one double sided token in their color adjacent to any other token on the board causing everything between the new token and that player's tokens already on the board to 'flip' to their color.

I purchased this game at a fundraiser, and the box was torn at the corners (nothing tape won't fix!), but the game itself is in very good condition.

RATING: 5
A challenging classic with a finite (though large) set of interactions, like checkers (draughts), most chesses, or tic-tac-toe, so studying the game's strategies can be heavily rewarding.  I generally prefer to play games for recreation, however, so give me a game with surprises, in which the game isn't always won by constantly scrutinous analysis.  If I play this game tactically, however (which I do), then it can feel surprising and funnish.

The tag line "A minute to learn, a lifetime to master" caught me.  Unfortunately, I don't think I care to master it.  I'm much more interested in Go plus my wife doesn't really like it.

Very simple and strategic game. As the board gets filled up, decisions become more and more important and typically one person will start to creep ahead of the other. Games are usually close between the players and the winner isn't known until all pieces are counted. I don't play this game often and I'm not sure I'd pick this one over other 2-player strategic games that I own. It was fun when there were not many options to choose from, though.

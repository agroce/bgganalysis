Pretty neat abstract game, with each player targeting a different player.  There's a sizable chunk of randomness in the game, due to each player drawing and playing element tiles on a public board, but that did not detract from the experience to me.

Not one I would need to own, as I own Glux and Sagrada and those cover my abstract bases pretty well, but would play again.

In Element, players take turns drawing and placing four element stones to encircle opposing sages. Each element has unique properties that players can use to block an opponent's movement. Feed walls of flame, move raging rivers, raise impenetrable mountain ranges, and even bend wind to your command. Transform one element into another with the rule of replacement or sacrifice element stones to help your sage avoid capture.

RATING: 7
Solid, fun game with four players. Reasonable, but not amazing two player game. Better as a light, wacky, everyone running around the board like headless chickens than as a serious abstract.

Major rules clarifications (I'm pretty sure):

1) You have to decide how many tiles you are pulling before reaching into the bag and then you must pull that many out.
2) Fire can take out any number of wind stones in a stack.
3) Water pulls only water stones that are in a *straight line* away from it. You have to pick which line, if there are multiple options available. The remainder that weren't in the straight line you chose are left behind.

My one concern (other than the vagueness in the rules) is that if we ignore luck, the 'capture the person on your right' rule just finds the greatest disparity in player ability at the table, not the best player. If you really wanted to determine who was the best in a four player game, you would need to do a lot of table reordering to determine who was the best of everyone. Obviously, you could just play two player, for tournament play, but I could see someone blowing up at your average gaming event over this game simply because he was the "best" at the table, yet kept losing because there was a bigger discrepancy somewhere else in the turn order.

I'd recommend having a dime or some other small marker to help keep track of which piece was the water stone you placed, when moving a river.

Takes a couple of turns to fully grasp the gameplay, as each element not only has the ability to supersede another element, but also functions in a completely different way from other elements.  Area control is important, but less so than other games since a "jump" with air elements can let a sage escape a corner.

There's some neat stuff going on here, but I only got to taste the tip of it in a 4p game. Perhaps 2p might be more rewarding? Though the "beat your left-hand neighbor" dynamic is one that can work quite well, and Element looks like it adds some mitigation vs. the "one player plays poorly and hands the game to their hunter while the other players watch helplessly" problem (namely, that any player can play Air - or perhaps Water - to try and give a nearly-hemmed-in player an out.)

Games do need to go long enough to even out the luck of the draw, but that's probably the norm with experienced players?

I have already had outstanding value in playing Element, as I did also with Onitama. I started playing as soon as I got my game and it will only increase in value when I get more people to play with and as I learn more about the game. When you have an outstanding game, one game is all you need.

An absolutely amazing game design. Got a chance to visit with the designer/artist at GAMA 2017 and they said this one was in development for 10 years and it shows. I don't usually like abstracts but I can't deny this is a flawless game. Only reason I'm not rating it a 10 is b/c I only played it 2-player.

Abstract strategy with luck of the draw.  Inside the box components, but on the shelf doesn't look particularly inviting to play--would never have picked the game up on my own.  Invited to play & quite enjoyed it.  Loved the 4 element movement rules which are easily taught and understood in 5 minutes.  I do quibble with the 30-60 mins time.  This can easily turn into a brain burner for many I know.  At the start of your turn there is a luck draw, which makes planning ahead is difficult and lengthens play.    Worked well as a 2 player game.

Generally, I don't play abstract games, and I must confess I fell in love with Element because of its components. Anyway, immediately after the first game, I realized that it's absolutely brilliant. It's not hard to learn, and I'm sure it plays well even with 4 people. If I play it, it's always in 2. Love it.

I like abstract games, I usually play Reversi, TRENCH, Arimaa, Abalone, Quoridor, The Duke. This game is fantastic! It has a wonderful gameplay. Besides, it has unique design aspects: 1) It is an abstract for four, very rare (Quoridor, Medina, Torres). 2) It has a nice theme which is perfectly integrated with the mechanics. 3) It incorporates some luck (random stones are taken each turn). Finally, it looks and feels so beautiful.

I'm not sure what to think about Element.  The game is beautiful and the mechanics are very interesting.  That being said, the game suffers from trying to accommodate 2-4 players.  With 2 players, the board seems too big and games drag on.  With 3-4 players, the board changes too much between your turns and it's difficult to plan (or you get captured before it's your turn again).

I played for the first time this weekend. I played five games with my adult daughter (my main gaming partner). I have only played two player so far. I've read that this doesn't play well with more but I wonder about that, it seems like it would be pretty neat with three or four. I'm going to have to try it.

This is a very fun abstract game that plays quickly, sometimes very quickly (I lost on the second or third turn once when my opponent drew four fire tokens at once). It's a thinky game that's not too thinky. Kind of Goldilocks thinky. It reminds me a little of Tash Kalar which is another favorite abstract of mine. This one is a little less of a brain burner than TK though.

One thing that I don't like about this game is the down time between turns. I almost always feel that I can win the game on every draw if I just play pieces the right way. This can lead to some AP. Since I don't know what pieces I will have, I really can't plan out my next turn. I use the time to see how my opponent might trap me but it is a bit of a negative.

The components are very nice, well-made and attractive. The rules are pretty clear and easy to understand.

I played this for the first time with more than two players. It's interesting and fun but I think I prefer two player.

When I first saw this game, I wasn't sure what to think...an abstract game that plays well with 4 people?  But I have to say this game is great! I does take a bit of time to fully understand the element stone powers and replacement rules, but otherwise it is fairly simple to understand. I also very much enjoyed the aspect of having a specific target, who was not going after you...Great game...go get it...and go play it!

I need to play this more to see to what extent fortunate tile pulls plays a role in this game, but I like what I've seen so far, and has the potential to go up in score for me. A good blend between being offensive and defensive, simple rules, and I can really see this being a great game with 3 and 4 players, which can be rare for this sort of thing.

Also, this has terrific player pieces! So cute, and they have a nice heft.

I love this game.  It usually strikes all of the right notes with newer players too.  The designer set out to make a game that felt as old as the ages but with a fresh feel by making it more tactical (short-term maneuvering) and less strategic (long-term planning).  The result is an excellent little gem that usually plays in 15 to 30 minutes.

My only criticism is that I wish the promo cards were a standard inclusion.

I love this game. It’s currently my favorite and most played game. The mechanics are relatively simple (takes a little clarification at first, but the rulebook and 7-minute How To Play Element video by Rather Dashing answered all my questions). Also, the components are fantastic. I’ve played this with hardcore gamers, my young son, and my middle school game group. They’ve all really enjoyed the deep strategy and elegant design. Finally, I love how this is an abstract, though the mechanics truly mirror the earth-wind-fire-water theme of the title. I see myself playing and enjoying this game for a long time.

Element is an interesting, colorful, dynamic, and challenging tactical game. I love the way the changing terrain unfolds differently in each game as the players essentially draw unique, moving landscape maps. The interacting elements create a splendid pattern evoking a pleasant aesthetic experience. I also enjoy the relationship between stone placement and movement points. The fewer stones you place, the more you can move. However, Element is entirely tactical, and there is a high random factor that can result in luck-driven quick conclusions. If you want more strategy in an abstract game this may not be for you. But if you enjoy a dose of the random supported by improvisational, on your toes creative thinking, you will enjoy this. Although there is a lot to think about Element features light and breezy play. So while there is some depth in the game, I wouldn't take it too seriously either. This will be in the rotation for awhile.

The powers seem a little unbalanced as the water is very strong, but ones you know how to play you realize that as you expand blockers they can also turn around and hurt you, so you must plan ahead and ensure that you are in a better position before creating large walls. Even after a few plays though I found the mechanic to not really be very interesting. It is nice to be able to play at four but as far as abstracts go this would not be near the top for me.

I'll be curious to see how my thoughts change on this over time. Thus far Element has been a good abstract game that I enjoy, but I am concerned that the game is not as deep as I might hope--the random nature of the drawing of stones seems like it may have a bigger effect on outcomes among skilled players than actual skill which will make me revise this heavily downward if it comes to that. An interesting experience though at 2. I probably wouldn't play at 3 or 4.

[gameid=1875] where there are four kinds of blocking pieces with individual special powers.

I really like how the special powers interact with each other, especially the air tokens, which enable players to create express routes all over the board.

I think this will be better at two only. I admire the adaptation for the 3 and 4 player game - you win only if you isolate the player to your left (or rather, if a player is isolated, the previous player wins). This prevents kingmaking situations, but it makes the game less interactive as I don't care much what the player who's playing before me is doing. As there is potential AP in this game, this is an issue for me in the 3-4 player game.

A blend of mechanical... elements from Chess to Go with unique twist of board control. Capture other sages in mountainous tombs, ravaging whirlwinds, stampeding rivers, and instatible infernos to be the last able to move freely.

No game is ever the same so replay value is high. The pieces are really well made. The explaination of rules are lacking in finesse, but once you re-read the booklet several times you will get it.

A cool new take on an abstract game. I really enjoyed this game. I like abstracts, but I find them hard to get to the table in my gaming circles. This is one I'd happily play again. Water seems to be the most powerful and a long "river" can move very far and partially or fully enclose your opponent. Fire seems to be the least powerful in my eyes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's neat and clean but seems to always (always!) end with a larger river flow move.  That detracts from the game, especially in games with more than 2 players, where the river might form because of events beyond your control.  Some kind of rule to slow down rivers could make this game a real gem.  It's less of an issue with 2 players.  With 4, the game was just a matter of waiting until you drew several water tokens after some other people had drawn water but not won.  The clever maneuvering is overwhelmed by that one piece of luck.

candidate house rule:  2x2 blocks of water are lakes are are never considered to be part of a river for the purpose of flowing (or counting length to determine flow distance).  Adding a stone into the lake, of course, stops it from being 2x2 and returns it to being a river.

Very clever abstract game.  I like the water movement.  The designer put a lot of thought into the design of each of the elements (water, fire, earth, and wind) and how they interact.  Starts out slow but eventually the game builds up.  This game is a victim of the changing tastes of our family gaming.  Abstracts are not in favor with our current tastes which is reflected in the rating.  Also, we are starting to not like games where the objective is to target someone.  Games like 7 Wonders appeals because you can do your own thing but there is also military to give someone a jab but not a right hook to the face.  With this game you are targeting someone to block them in, and some defense to make sure you don't get blocked in.  Not our current gaming tastes.

Very clever and intuitive element movement. Like how you only need to trap one opponent. Moves quick and plays just the right length.

Based on first few plays, I find this game quite interesting. I like how different elements play different one and the others, and also how one element overrides the other. I am still having difficulties in maximizing the different elements to capture my opponent. On the top of that, having other players competing who can achieve their goal first, makes it even more challenging. I need to play this game again to appreciate the depth and chaos. :)

First play impression: The rulebook is not great. Yes there are tons of examples, but there are a lot of specific situations that aren't covered and other things just aren't explained very well. I've seen multiple reviewers do water movement incorrectly (by moving all contiguous water instead of just one straight line of water), which would have a huge impact on the game.

Also, it seems like drawing 3-4 earth stones at any point during the game can almost result in a win. During my game, we were relieved whenever drawing earth stones and a little annoyed whenever drawing wind stones (they allow free movement).

I know it's an important part of the game, but I don't like that stones can be removed from the board. This can result in a growing and shrinking board state, instead of a board state that eventually grows toward a definitive conclusion. So there is potential for games to drag and drag.

It might sound like I'm being hard on the game, but in the current climate of games like Santorini, Onitama, Glux, and maybe Tak (haven't played that one yet) I'm not sure if Element can cut it. Much more randomness, some stones are more useful than others, the grid doesn't shrink according to player count, potential to drag on, and inelegant rules would all give any abstract games fan pause.

Of course, more plays could reveal some of these issues to be unmerited. Will rate after more plays.

Update: Wow, this game does NOT work with three players. Played three games in a row because each game only lasted about 5-10 minutes. Since twice as many stones get placed on the board between each of your turns, you can pretty quickly get into a position where you're just trapped against at least one or two stones. Then as long as your opponent doesn't get unlucky while drawing stones, you'll be surrounded easily. The game was just unsatisfying to all involved, even the winner of each game. "I pulled four non-wind stones, so I guess I win."

An interesting abstract game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The 4-p version of the game has a quirky victory scenario: To win, you need to capture your opponent's piece on your right. However, any captured piece, accidental or otherwise will results in a win for the captor regardless of whether the designated captor had a hand in capturing the target. Neat! 

The game play however is a bit disjointed. The elements (pun intended) are there for a good abstract game, but game play is almost purely tactical and even then, there seems to be very little one can do to control your own fate. Initial pieces are somewhat arbitrarily placed since it is almost impossible to trap someone early one. There are simply too many escape routes. However, once the board becomes filled in, one has to be careful that you don't venture into a crowded area. Basically, the board can get crowded really quickly and in a 4p game, it is possible that you won't get a chance to respond because your position will be locked in. The gripe I have is that with 4p, you don't have a chance to develop any strategy to confine your opponent. The board and movement of pieces occur too easily in the beginning and is quickly locked out late in the game. You may win the game by chance if your opponent ventures into a crowded region or other players may have done your work by indirectly surrounding your target captive with elemental stones. Basically, the 4p game is a bit to chaotic. I can easily see that this game is better with 2p.

The theme though, is quite cool!!

Really neat abstract game that plays in 30 minutes or less. The object is to trap an opponents sage by means of placing element tokens, each of which have a unique power. The powers of the elements and the rule of replacement means you'll have several interesting decisions to make on your turn. The rules are fairly straightforward and the book contains several examples for each element. Component wise, the quality is pretty good but the plastic pieces definitely have an odor to them.

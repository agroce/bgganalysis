In some ways, this game appears to be a direct decedent of [thing=620][/thing]: it's a CDG involving area control and using the military to achieve political objectives, and it's a simple game with a clearly written rulebook and attractive counters.

Two things about this one are really unique and special: First, you control the length of the game:  you select the starting year and look up the set-up.  You decide what year to finish and find the objectives for that year.  So the game can go from 1-11 turns, depending on your preference.  Second, you have the ability to "bank" your operation points for later use.

Overall a supurb game that deserves far more recognition than it receives.

Hearts and Minds feels very different to any other game in my collection.  It does something slightly different with the card driven format, with most cards not presenting a straightforward choice between resource (action) points and an event.  The concept of banking resource points for that big push later or to ward off disaster is also novel.  The movement rules, with no need to stop when your units enter enemy controlled territory and strategic movement along the Ho Chi Minh trail or by sea, make for a very fluid game.  The asymmetry of the sides is also very well done. Most importantly, I found Hearts and Minds fun and challenging to play.  

The rules are an easy read but vague or ambiguous on several important points. As others have commented, the map is too small, with important details tending to get lost under piles of counters.  The artwork is plain but functional.

RATING: 8
Having now played it a few times, I've come to really enjoy this game. It seems to me to offer a good portrayal of the Vietnam War (although admittedly I'm not very knowledgeable). It also presents some nice challenges in the choice of tactics and overall strategy (I was quite amused in one game playing the US that I'd developed a fixation for body count: I'd be winning if NVA casualties were significantly greater than mine...)

Mechanics wise, it's a normal CDG, with a neat twist in that you can buy the events on the cards for OPs, rather than choosing; I think this really goes towards increasing the flavour provided by the cards which is a strength of CDGs. The one strange thing that took some getting used to is that units don't have ZOCs as such, you can move through enemy units and share a province, fighting demands expenditure of OPs. That said, the game is pretty simple, and play time shouldn't be too excessive (plus you have the option of starting and finishing in any year).

Tentative review after three plays.

I think there is a great game here. Its tense, thematic and interesting with, seemingly, a number of different viable strategies for each player.

On the other hand, the rules are poorly presented with vague explanations and lots of key rules hidden around the rule and play books. Also, the map could have been bigger and flashier, seriously guys.

It has arrived, and looks VERY interesting.  First impression is that this will be a playable Vietnam game with a very historical "feel," and that players' time will be spent fighting the war, not the game system.

Excellent card-driven-wargame.   Each card provides resource points, which you can use for action(s) and/or buy the event on the card - makes for interesting choices.  Captures the asymmetrical nature of the war.  Victory conditions are listed for each year, so you can play any set of years you want - short game or long campaign.

Initial Impression: The components in this game leave something to be desired, as the cards are small and not rounded, the counters are offcut, and the mounted board seems rough and unfinished. However, the game itself is like no other CDG I've experienced before. Pro's;
- you can choose how long you want to play
- each player has a deck comprised of their own cards and some neutral cards which are randomly inserted face down into their deck. The randomness will keep the players guessing what's in their own decks
- each card grants Resource Points. In order to play the card's event, you need to "buy" the event with RPs
- Unspent RPs can be banked for use later in the game. They are never discarded
- All the player aids and charts are printed on the board

This is probably a next generation CDG. H&M has a clever card system where Ops and event can be played together with a small OPs sacrifice. The random card dealing don't prevent to pursue a strategic plan thanks to the offensive cards. Players have control over the main strategic decisions. I guess these huge improvements will be imitated soon.
The rules are quite simple. I need to see if the game will still be good after repeated play.
The core idea of area control is similar to the monster VG Vietnam game. The designer made an excellent job to streamline some events as coups.
The production value is low, components are cheap, expecially the counters but functional. No german game production value here.
I like the board though, and also the compact box is a plus. The game plays fast with just 4 action rounds each year.
Keep an eye on this title, it promises a lot.

Gameplay is excellent; very difficult for blue;
production value : counters badly cut, map way too small; you need to download the new rules, which are still not very clear, but after a few questions resolved it is a very playable game that I like.  And the Vietnam war in one or 2 sittings! 3 turns in less than 3h.
Gets better with the "Redux" map: get it!

A shame that it was so underdeveloped.

Loving this game so far. It had me thinking of my next move (PBEM) when I went to bed and I would wake up the next morning planning that move still. How often does that happen anymore? A new game has rarely interested me this much for some time.

So, what did I like? This was my first area control CDG. Well, that is no actually true since I have played UKC a few times in the past (and really liked that game too). OK, it is my first area control game where I was able to really focus on the aspects and implications of that design since it was a PBEM game. That in itself was a treat. I enjoyed how I had to rethink my concept of a wargame slightly and move away from the idea of fighting for fighting's sake.

I liked the assymetric strengths/weaknesses between Red and Blue. Despite the simple ruleset, I think it captures that nature of the war nicely. In addition, the dividing of the black cards into both sides' unique decks was a simple and effective way to create further uncertainty during play. That would also help with replayability to some degree. I find the campaigns that each side can utilize (one per year) helps to drive the game narrative along as they can provide varying short term focus. I also liked that there are many ways to go about achieving your goals (at least if you are Red anyway). You can spend RPs (OPs) from the cards in many different ways as well; movement, combat, province control, buying the card event or even tucking them away for a rainy day. 

I also like that the campaigns, if called in the same year but in different regions, make the player balance between offence and defense often using RPs from the same card play. Finding a balance between the two is an interesting challenge.

Oh...and you can start and stop at any year between 1965 and the mid 70's. Nifty.

There is some meat on the bones of this game to be sure. I am still exploring this little gem and will be able to form a more coherent opinion later on. In the meantime, I am rating this quite high after my initial introduction as I have not been as intrigued with a new game since I first played UKC.

PROS: Original. Thought provoking. A lot of game in a small package. Nice rules. Asymmetric sides. Simple yet with good decision points. Appears quite replayable.

CONS: Not really seeing any now. How 'bout them apples!

RATING: 8
A fun quick playing card driven game. Both rule and counter density are new player friendly, and there appears to be enough depth and replayability here that I can see playing this years to come. My only gripe is that the rule book is missing some key rules that are included in the scenario booklet instead and the map is a bit on the small side. I'm not a huge fan of the map art, but it is serviceable. Rating is based only on a couple of plays.

Ordered 2/1 and its on the way!  :)  REALLY looking forward to this.  The only other Vietnam game I've really enjoyed is Victory in Vietnam II.  I have high hopes for this game.
Arrive today 2/4!  Looking forward to playing this real soon :)

2/7: 1st play under my belt and this is very :cool: There are only a few minor questions I've had so far, but the rest is very well done.  The military, political control and pacification aspects are well modeled, IMO.  This game is now at the top of my favorite Vietnam games.  Lighter than some others, it still brings the flavor and challegnes of the war in a playable and realisitic manner.  :thumbsup:

Played 65 and 66 solo (started in 65). 

Have also played 65 and 66 face to face. 

Very, very good game so far. Frustrating for the Allies, as it should be! The NVA/VC (Red) can't really match up with the Allies face to face, but Red has lots of tricks up their sleeves to frustrate the Allies. 

So far, the key seems to be keeping the S Vietnam govt from collapsing. If you do that you will build up ARVN vets who can search and destroy the VC and withstand any NVA onslaught.

RATING: 8
OK, well, I'm starting to think that some balance for Blue may be in order. Maybe some bonus SRPs, something. I played a game recently where 1967 saw the US with a hand of 2,2,2,3,3 ops, none of the 2s were responses, while the NVA got a hand total of something like 15 or 16 in their best four cards. That was the game right there. There are a lot of ramps in the game, and if the US get behind on political control, or attrition, or SRPs, they seem to rapidly enter a death spiral. Getting hawks out of their offensives is very hard, Blue really cannot expect to succeed in a turn where both players have offensives going in separate corps areas, at least, not without substantial banked ops. If the NVA impales themselves on Blue firepower in I Corps, that'll help a lot, but you just can't count on them doing that unfortunately :)

Anyway, I'm not quite sure. But I'd probably offer Blue some sort of balance the next time I play.
---
Up to four plays, and this has held up quite well. I was a little worried the Reds might have it too easy, but now I don't think so. Just remember: after all the tactical CDGs we've seen in the past 10 years, this has gone back to the "old school" of Hannibal, and is about political control, with your opponent's army being something that should be treated as being in the way of your gaining political control, rather than something to be defeated as an end in and of itself. Also: pacification is not political control; pacification just avoids coups. I think it's easy to over-do the pacification as Blue, just because coups are so painful. You definitely don't want coups if you can avoid it. But pacification is expensive and doesn't win the war, so don't go nuts.

Like Hannibal, there is a fair amount of chaos and luck here. It's definitely not as interesting or nuanced as Hannibal is in that department, but it's also a lot simpler and shorter.
---
Only played the once, but initial impressions were extremely positive. Very asymmetric, plays at a good pace with lots of action, the system is quite clean but presents  plenty of tough decisions. The card decks and card management seem to have been well done. Give the new player the Reds, I think; the tactics for Blue are a little more diverse and not as easy to develop. Having played Red, I can't say I have a good handle on how Blue should be played, but I can theorize that it's not a good idea to get into a slugging match with the NVA, as satisfying as that may be given the kill ratios you can rack up. Playing time seems to not *quite* be in the sweet spot of 3 hours (which is about what is easy for me to do on a weeknight these days), but '65-'72 should be doable in 4-ish. Like a lot of these games, short and ultra-short scenarios are provided and can be played, but given the chaos and the card distribution you probably want to do the full thing; playing 65-72 feels right. Plus, sensible auto-victory thresholds are provided, which is good.

Clearly drew some inspiration from the classic VG monster game Vietnam, of which I am a fan.

A shame about the rules, which are not great. Not terrible, but for a fairly low-complexity game, they should have been better.

Anyway, the rating is provisional, replayability and balance are always issues, and one play isn't enough obviously to say for sure. But initial impressions were very good and I am much more optimistic than usual on this one.

RATING: N/A
Having read the playtest rules for HoM, I fear the game misses the essence of counterinsurgency warfare.

As the developer himself said about the game: "There is no tracking of Vietnamese loyalties because it's not important." 

I therefore think this game misses the essence of the conflict. The title "Hearts & Minds" really only is done justice in the game in respect to the US public debate over the war, yet not in respect to the Vietnamese themselves. That very US-centric approach also explains why the designer previously used the working-title "Vietnam: The Second American Civil War".

The game may very well be both fun and do a good job at portraying a number of facets of the conflict, yet I consider its basic premise flawed and hence just not a game for me.

"We The People" treatment of Vietnam War.  Premise:  the more influence the Reds can wield in South Vietnam, and the more American troops they can kill, the less the will of the Allies to stay and fight.  Allies busy putting out fires, while Reds need to balance the efficacy of trying to use the Viet Cong every turn with the temptation to forgo it to maximize the effect of events.  Significant amount of tit-for-tat influence swapping as is typical of card-driven wargames.

An excellent reinterpretation of what a card driven game can be.  After half a dozen plays I still feel I have room to explore.  

------------------

Update having played 2nd edition.

The second edition is an improvement and _might_ be easier for the Blue player (given our limited plays).  Several cards are rebalanced, and the board is now bigger.  The cards are still sub-standard and need sleeving,  Worthington has provided sleeves free of charge.  It almost goes without saying that they're the wrong size (use Yu-Gi-Uh sized sleeves instead).  

The game's presentation continues to have other faux pas, a complete failure to describe how one wins the game being the most glaring example.  Regardless, H&M continues to be a great game ... unfortunately it's produced by Worthington.

Very good and enjoyable game about Vietnam War. Rules are easy to grasp (but sometimes not too clear) interesting mechanics (buying events, campaign cards, promoting units, etc.) and chrome stuff. Good historicity level.
Bottom line: average production value (especially 1st edition), much scripted about reinforcements and Vietnamization but I think, that it is good in simulating conflict dynamics.

Area movement CDG game depicting the entire war.  The cards really add a narrative to the game.  Combat and political aspects are handled well.  However I'm not a fan of games that spend cdg card points to flip or place control markers such as Washingtons War.  I feel combat will be overlooked/avoided in favor of placing markers.  I gave it an extra point as there are not many strategic level Vnam games otherwise gameplay is a 6.

RATING: 9
An excellent game recreating the Vietnam war at a high enough level of abstraction to make the game play fast while still enacting some of the history from the period.  When 1969 comes and Vietnamization begins, the game radically changes as the US start pulling out its veteran units.  The Tet Campaign has an awesome mechanic that sees combat all over the country while still keeping the NVN player focused on some specific objectives.  The map is far too small for the counters and the counter quality is quite low (uncentered counters with frayed corners) but printing and assembling the redux map and clipping the counters helps significantly.  I am so happy I was able to acquire a copy from Noble Knight after it has been out of print with no strong signs of it coming back any time soon.  A keeper for sure!

RATING: 8
A tough balancing act for the Allied player.  US casualties cost victory points.  ARVN casualties cause instability and can result in the dreaded coup.  The NVA player faces similar tough choices.  Concentrate and you present a target for US bombers.  Disperse and you can be picked off easily.  An interesting game that is different from your standard wargame.

One problem with the game as published is that the map is too small.  It isn't usable.  I raised my rating as I got a large, very nicely done map from the web and printed it on poster size paper.  This is a necessity to play this game.  Rating raised.

Raised rating again after multiple plays.  This is a good game.

I'm at best lukewarm about it. My biggest beef is how the campaign cards work. They reward you extra VPs for controlling certain regions at the end of a year (Twilight Struggle has something similar). They felt very gamey, especially the Tet Offensive card (which had a ton of fiddly special rules).

Also, while the designer put a lot of emphasis on both the political and military struggle, as I had hoped, there were lots of details of both I didn't really like. On the political side, the significance of the VC, at least through 1968, seems under-rated, and the game really needed a system of political control more like We the People/Washington's War/Hannibal. It largely neglects the anti-insurgency dimension of the conflict ("hearts and minds"--which is in the game's title!) by relegating the Viet Cong to a small number of weak units, and making VPs (but not much else) dependent on control of provinces.  Still, it does get a few things right, such as the steady erosion of US popular support for the war.

On the military side, the choice of where to have details, and where to abstract, was weird: the units are extremely generic strength points, just a few specials like US Air Cav, yet there are specific mechanics for raids and ambushes (which definitely don't make sense at this high strategic level). Yet strangely for a high-level game, it downplays important decisions like the bombing of North Vietnam (e.g. Operation Rolling Thunder, Operation Linebacker). And the balance of forces just seems off: the NVA are too numerous and powerful, it's too easy for a big stack to zoom in suddenly via the Ho Chi Minh Trail and pound on even a decent-sized US force. In the real war, Communist forces nearly always avoided large-scale attacks like this because they were nearly always outgunned.

Partly as a result of this, play balance is strongly against the US side, at least among non-expert players.

It's worth trying out the game, but unless you have a particular interest in the war (like me), not worth buying on its own merits as either history or as a game. It feels like a game system that would have been best suited to cover some of the major campaigns of the war at a strategic level, such as the Tet Offiensive, but instead got stretched past its breaking point to try to cover the whole war.

Get ready to crank the CCR, and start dropping your favorite 'Nam movie quotes like bombs from the belly of a B-52. This game captures the conflict on a strategic level like none other, as well as the feel of it through card-driven historical events. It also challenges each player to work within the confines of very different operational strictures. In short, I highly recommend.

Don't. Just don't. Buy your missus some flowers. Put the money in a charity box. Buy some booze for a hobo. Just don't spend your readies on this rubbish.

Where to even begin? The contents are a disgrace to our hobby. Cheap, shoddy counters with the wrong military equipment stamped on them (but I'm not going to condemn this per se, as I value abstraction). A preposterously small and tacky map (tacky as in rubbish, not sticky), poor quality cards that bend just by looking at them - and for the grognards out there, for this sort of money I really shouldn't be having to buy card protectors for a first play.

The rulebook was clearly edited by a mentally unwell person. Entire blocks of rules are left out, or (I suspect) it is assumed that the players will be aware of what the designer intended. I discovered the rules for reinforcements serendipitously, buried at the back of the playbook, with nary a mention to them in the main body.

The depiction of the war is the most unrealistic I've ever seen - the version of Vietnam in 'Watchmen' is more accurate than this one. The US Navy steams up and down the coast like Victorian gunboats, the ARVN is considered the military equal of the US forces, the VC play absolutely no role of value at all, and the US Air Force might as well be engaged in leaflet raids for all the impact they have.

As a previous writer put it, the NVA builds up in Cambodia or the north, then massive Kursk-style battles result every few months, like a jungly Stalingrad. There is no strategy, no sense of epic struggle, no sense that the outcome is in the balance. Exit is pre-programmed, making the game a pointless endeavour each time. Maybe this was Vietnam all along, but it makes for a boring game when the outcome cannot be determined.

Words can't describe how disappointed I was with this game, from the moment I opened the box and saw the contents (even the dice are miniscule, for God's sake), to the moment I put it back in the box, never to open it again. I'd really hoped someone would do the 'Nam justice, but I'll have to keep waiting. I'll never buy something from Worthington Games again, if this is the production values they think is acceptable to put on the market - I know there's a recession on, but come on. The designer should hang his head in shame, or attribute this one to Alan Smithee....

I haven't sold, traded or burnt this game however, which may surprise you. In the same sense that Auschwitz is kept standing, as a reminder of utter evil and atrocity (and in no sense am I making comparison here, only analogy), I keep this game to remind me of how bad boardgames can truly get. A game of Ludo, or Snakes & Ladders, is actually more entertaining than H&M - at least the outcome is variable in those games.

I liked my one play of this quite a bit, its fairly light (twilight struggle level) but evocative Nam game that deals out opportunities and threats in equal measure. Perhaps it feels a bit reactionary rather than operational plan focused but it is a high level game. The reason i have docked it to a 6.5 rather than perhaps a 7 or even an 8 is that the rules are possibly the worst I have ever seen. It is possible if you check forums and think through the card text etc to decipher the designers intention but it is asking far more than a 2nd edition should ask.

This game reminds me of Hellenes - Both are card-driven wargames featuring asymmetric sides. Very challenging stuff. Players must concentrate greatly on dealing with the asymmetry - not easy. Playing into the enemy's strength and not your own will lead rapidly to the enemy's auto-victory. Thus, it captures well the different capabilities of the VC/NVA and the US/ARVN forces. 

I find that some of the card events are a little weak and pointless but I can't fault the immense flavour that the cards capture about the era. I mean, how many wargames are there with a Creedence Clearwater Revival event? :thumbsup:

The downside is not so much in the game design than in the development/publication. Rules were a little ambiguous and had editing issues, map was too small, and historically inaccurate tank/arty graphics were used, which detracted from the game slightly.

Provides excellent history and fast competitive gameplay, but the rulebook is awful. It needs a revision. Also I'm not sure I like the idea of set reinforcements and withdrawals. I also think the Allied player should receive more SRPs.

UPDATE: Second edition rules are great. Print them and play with them. My only addition is blue always gets 1 extra SRP.

A sometimes brilliant game that delivers a high-level view of the war in a reasonable (for a wargame) length of time. It is easier to figure out how to do things than it is to determine why you are doing them. Worth playing.

Some people complain about the components quality. 
I think it is pretty regular quality for wargames' standards. 

Cards need to be sleeved though. 

UPDATE
Tentative rating after a two year play. The game is nice and - for what I can see - very very tight. 
Our first year was a little slow and cautious, the second year has seen one of the bloodiest seasons ever as we became slowly accustomed to the rules. 

I'm very eager to play this again somewhat soon. 

UPDATE
I'm always thinking about this game. I really like it. I want to play again! Solid "8" from me, with a VERY probable ascending rating in the near future.

This is a great game, bottom line.  Quick years with a strong sense of the Vietnam conflict.  The Blue has a definite sense of losing ground to the Reds, but will the Reds get the job done on time?  Even just one very strong Allied year can put the Reds in recovery mode for 2-3 years.  However, there are multiple paths to victory for both sides and the way combat, infiltration, bombing, and even political control is handled is all simple enough while still being excellently done.

The whole 10-turn game does take a full day session (6 hours?), but any given year takes less than an hour.  The campaigns really drive the conflict, but the game itself is very good with many different ways to score points.

Initial impressions while playing my first PBEM game.

Agile, dynamic and, most importantly, lots of fun. The thematic feel is also really good, even at such large scale.

Really like some of the new mechanics such as the campaign cards, the possibility of stocking OPs, or the inclusion of a third card deck.

The rulebook could be better though, as it is a little bit disorganised and comes with a pretty decent load of ambiguities.

RATING: 8
A fundamentally simple CDG with good asymmetry for the two sides: Red must take control of provinces while inflicting US casualties, Blue must avoid the above and maintain South Vietnamese stability. The split deck design is very varied as the neutral cards are divided randomly at the start of the game. One of the most uniquely flexible aspects of this design is the ability to start and end the game at any point along the year track, allowing a game to be of almost any length. Be sure to print the v2 Rules and Playbook, they're a huge improvement over what comes in the box and you may want the enlarged map to better hold the counters. Good to see a CDG about a largely ignored conflict.

This is a wargame. If the lower quality components don't convince you then there is plenty of die rolling and plenty of CRTs and plenty of CRT modifiers. It also follows the usual wargame convention of "Here are the movement rules, and here are the five thematic exceptions"

RATING: 7
I've played three partial games. Hearts and Minds is a very interesting addition to the CDG genre. The cards do not quite work as well as they could - many of the events seem either overpriced or rarely useable - but the rest of the game is fine. It seems more difficult to play the Allies, but I don't see a major balance issue. I do think the game is overlong - we have always aimed to play the whole war but have never managed it, so in future I think we'll agree to end the game around 1971 or 1972. The components of the first edition are not very good quality and the player aid has some mistakes and is not very well-organised. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Single 66-68 play only so far, but impressed by how good a GAME (rather than just wargame) this is, with asymmetric play for the two sides that demands aggressive but calculated play. Certainly there's period detail and an appropriate amount of historical modelling, but it serves the game rather than getting in the way of the game, something that can't be said for all wargames.

Strategy seems more important than tactics, which is right at this level of abstraction.

I have the second edition, wihch seems an improvement over the first in terms of component quality and usability.

RATING: 6
Mix of area control and combat works okay. There are some production decisions that could have improved the experience of playing (For example, if Saigon is always a fire base, why make us remember that? Print it on the board!). We found there wasn't quite enough fighting for a war game and it's a little too simplistic as a majority game. Not bad, but it only partially succeeds at being the hybrid it aspires to be.

RATING: N/A
Thanks for visiting the site.  I am considering changing the name of the game to   Hearts and Minds:Vietnam 1965-1970.  Still reflecting the political tone of the game but centering more on the action in Vietnam.  What are your thoughts?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hearts and Minds promises to be a CDG worth getting to know better. My rating could go up to an 8 with further play. 

I like the scale and the length of the game. The rules for veteran units make for interesting battles that intensify within a single card-play. Also, the cards themselves seem more interesting than your average CDG of late, and the system for slowly banking OPs is great. 

The auto-win structure seems solid. Basically, the VC forces are just a huge pain in the ass for the Americans, who are trying to tamp down on their progress as much as possible. If you let things get out of hand, it's a slippery slope to defeat. There are several interesting unit rules: the US can't afford to lose American units because of the outcry at home. But you also can't afford to lose South-Vietnamese troops, because those losses can precipitate a collapse of the SVN government, which is a big headache. It's a balancing act. 

I'm very close to taking the hardline stance lately that only three CDGs are worth playing: We the People, Hannibal, and Twilight Struggle. Hearts and Minds looks like it might have a place at the table. 

Update: After a second play, I continue to like the approachability of this game. It's a tough game where the side that gets behind will probably be knocked out of the war in short order. Early US strategy is becoming a lot clearer (spread out; duh). VC counter-strategy is still early days for us. I am interested in playing at least a couple more times. 

Update: After a third play, I'm at a loss. Literally. I keep losing the game, badly. I liked it at first but now I feel like I don't really understand it very well. It also seems to me that the events are close to being an afterthought; OPs are king.

Yo tengo la 2ª edición del juego, por lo que mis notas van referidas a esta. 

HARDWARE 
* El tablero es "montado", pero al estilo Worthington Games. Es decir, es un tablero rígido, pero nada que ver con los tableros montados de GMT. Las dobleces son reguleras y cuesta mucho mantenerlo plano sin un metacrilato pesado encima.
* Los counters son gruesos y fáciles de destroquelar, pero el troquel está ligeramente desplazado, por lo que los dibujos no están centrados y en algunos casos la información de las esquinas está parcialmente cortada. Al parecer, es un problema generalizado en esta edición del juego.
* El grafismo de mapa y counters es austero. Vamos a dejarlo ahí. Al menos, se ve todo muy claro sobre la mesa.
* Las cartas son pequeñas (bailan en una funda chimera), finuchas y sin cantear. Por lo menos, la información y el grafismo son claros.
* Las hojas de ayuda de juego. No existen. Punto. La información ha sido incorporada parcialmente al tablero de juego, pero se olvidaron de la explicación de las tablas, que no aparece ni en el manual ni en el tablero. Y esto incluye las condiciones de victoria. Búscate la vida. Ni en la web de la editorial han sido capaces de colgar una corrección o una FAQ. Por suerte, el autor contestó a una pregunta en la BGG sobre las condiciones de victoria colgando una ayuda de juego completa, con todas las tablas y su explicación.
* El manual es cortito y sencillo, aunque algunas cosas no están bien explicadas, tiene pocas referencias cruzadas y ¡sólo 1 mini ejémplo de juego!
Veredicto: SUSPENSO

SOFTWARE 
El juego es un Card Driven, pero muy flexible. Jugar una carta te da unos puntos de Recursos, que puedes gastar como quieras: activar una región para movimiento o combate, cambiar el control de la región, "comprar" el evento de la carta, etc. Los recursos no gastados se acumulan para turnos posteriores. Además, ambos bandos obtienen cada 4 turnos una cantidad de refuerzos, reemplazos y puntos de Recurso determinados.
En el tablero no existen lineas de suministro, frentes delimitados, ni tipos de terrenos diferenciados. Esto hace que la situación sea muy fluida, en constante cambio y movimiento.
Los combates no son muy numerosos (cuesta 1 recurso iniciar 1 ronda de combate) ni especialmente sangrientos, pero sumados a los bombardeos USA, las emboscadas del VC y algunos eventos, a lo largo del año la pila de bajas que se acumula en la casilla "Body Count" puede llegar a ser espectacular. Sobre todo, las tropas norvietnamitas que caen como moscas. Peeero también tienen una gran capacidad de recuperación. Y en cambio cada baja aliada duele: las bajas USA son puntos de victoria para los comunistas y las bajas survietnamitas aumentan las inestabilidad del país, lo que puede provocar un Golpe (y darle más puntos a los comunistas).
El jugador aliado tiene ante sí la misión de derrotar a los comunistas y pacificar el país, algo realmente complicado, ya que éstos vuelven una y otra vez hasta sacar a USA de la guerra. A pesar de todo, las condiciones de victoria están equilibradas y el juego resulta muy tenso y divertido.
En cuanto a la duración, hay setup para cada año de la guerra y se puede escoger a cuantos años jugar (cada año tiene sus propias condiciones de victoria y de muerte súbita), por lo que la partida dura lo que tu quieras. Nosotros tardamos menos de 1 hora por año.

A pathetic attempt to produce a game an historical game on Vietnam. While the system has some good point as a game it fails miserably in the historical camp. I would say that it reflects so poorly on the designer's ability that I will certainly not buy anything designed from him for a long while. The game is pure fantasy and I seriously doubt the designer had read anything recent on the Vietnam conflict and I cannot even disprove my contention because there is not bibliography included. The game reward suspicious tactics and operational approach and the net effect is quite different from reality. 

Production values are crappy. M2 Bradley in Vietnam? Funny thing was that the problem with counters was mentioned before production and the designer assured that it had been corrected... image in some cards have no relation with text (F-105 in what appears a Ryan Raider mission in the B-52 card for example). 

In conclusion H&M fails in every camp. Thanks God there two much better alternative out of there, VG Vietnam and Schutze Victory in Vietnam 2.

Sort of chess-like, the emphasis is on the political game and for the Allied player, minimizing casualties.  The North has mobility and the Viet Cong who can constantly change the allegiance of provinces all over the place.  The Allied player can spread out but then he is weak to defend against conventional attack.

Rating upgraded to 8.5 after second play.  Really evokes the right feel.  Challenging decisions for both sides.

On reflection, the game "works" but any resemblance to the Vietnam War is incidental.
--------------------------------------------------------
Limited play experience so far, but ok first impression.

Smooth and fast moving game play.  A lot of abstractions, but game mechanics and cards give a moderate "feel" of the Vietnam War (well, in hindsight, I would say an overly abstract view of the war and not very historical).

Game graphics are "functional", and thus are clear, easy to read, but not especially pretty.  Wished the map was slightly larger.  If you like the simpler, faster playing CDGs (like Hannibal, We the People), might be worth trying (and certainly play first before you buy kind of a design in my mind).

RATING: 8
Not a detailed simulation of the conflict, more an impressionistic sketch, this CDG still manages to convey a strong 'Nam flavour. Like many titles in the card-driven genre it has a puzzly feel, as you try to work out how best to exploit / mitigate the luck of the card draw.
One of the things I like best about this one is its fluidity, something facilitated by the innovation of being to buy events with ops points, rather than having to choose between ops and event. So it avoids the staccato rhythm of something like Pahs of Glory (although admittedly such a rhythm is appropriate for a WW1 game).
While many grumble about the quality of HaM's components, I find them to be fine, at least in the second edition (the only one I've experience of).
Some identify an imbalance in favour of the communist side, something the designer claims to have addressed in the second edition. It may be that HaM is similar in this regard to Wir sind das Volk, in that one of the sides requires more experience to win with.

Broad brush game of the Vietnam War with Blue (US and ARSV) and Red (NVA & VC) players vying for control of province sized areas. They gain and lose Hawks (US pro-war) and Doves (US anti-war) and it is assumed that the Blues cannot win, so it is a matter of holding back the Red Hordes as long as possible before the inevitable withdrawal. The Blues also have to stabilise the South Vietnamese as coups reduce veteran units to recruits and cost Hawks/Doves. The Reds have to do the opposite, infiltrating NVA units along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, gaining control of provinces and destabilising the Blue government. I find that adding one Hawk each turn makes for better play balance.

Excellent implementation of the card-driven system. Lots of tension and every turn is loaded with decision points. As the South Vietnam player, I felt like I was always one mistake away from losing the war. As the NVA player, I was holding on by a thread in every province, avoid mass formations that attract U.S. troops. H&M is dripping with theme and represents the subject matter very well (like Twilight Struggle does for the Cold War).

The knock here is that the components are lackluster. The mounted map shows creases immediately, and the counters are less than centered. I pre-ordered the second edition but the components didn't make up for the steep price tag.

Somehow this game didn't grab me. The creation of separate decks using player-specific and neutral cards was very interesting. The way the game seems to be structured around the campaign cards was also novel and clever. 

However, there was still something that was missing: maybe the brush strokes felt too broad; I'm not sure. I'd play it again, but I wouldn't choose it over any other CDG.

The components, incidentally, are some of the worst I've seen since the 1980s.

RATING: 8
This game plays quickly, is easy to learn and has good replay value. The scenario format is a nice feature for those not wanting to play the entire war in one sitting while maintaining the proper feel for the system 

I really like the banked OP's system and I also like how the game revolves around political control, yet you need your military to accomplish this.  Each side plays differently which gives it the Wash War feel.  The VP requirements are very tight which means you really need to get going quickly or an auto victory will occur much faster than most other games.

There are not many Vietnam games in general and even less that combine both the political and military aspects of the battle and this game does both very well.

The main issue with this game is that it treats counterinsurgency as simply normal combat, except you must first find the VC. Afterwards, you're free to engage them normally. Since there's no real way for the VC and NVA to hide, it's a bit too easy for the US to win. The US support units provide the ARVN with overwhelming firepower, even after 'vietnamisation' occurs with the withdrawal of US infantry units.

I would call H & M the A House Divided of the Vietnam games and believe it will become a classic wargame. The map is quite sturdy but some of the proviences are a bit small for stacking. I have the magnetic clips for counters but the counters a so thick I could not mount my game but that wasn't a big deal. The thick counters are very nice. I would suggest card sleaves for the cards. I like the way some of the cards are black and are divided before the game. That way no game is going to play the same way twice. Even though the cards and VC make the game lean toward a two player game, I still was able to play it solitare and found it enjoyable. I think it will take a while to figure out the different stratagies for each side to use. A VERY WELL DONE GAME for the level it was designed for. In my opinion Victory Games Vietnam is probably the best serious simulation on the Vietnam War but Hearts & Minds is no doubt the best playing game to come out on the topic.

One of my favorite political/warfare hybrids.  Play the entire 65-72 campaign in 4 hours or less.  Battle losses have a profound effect on the political/VP track, and this is where the game shines most brightly.  Having neutral cards shuffled into each players deck, as well the asymetries between the sides, promises a long shelf life.

Quibbles;
Some counters are too big for the map.
Paying RPs to trigger events is a nice innovation, but some cards seem ill conceived in this regard.

Le traitement de la guerre du Vietnam dans Hearts and Minds m'a tout à fait convaincu. Etant le joueur américain (et sud-vietnamien), je me suis senti dans la peau de ces stratèges de West Point un peu perdus devant cette guerre non conventionnelle. La stratégie qu'il est nécessaire d'adopter est en effet un peu contre-intuitive dans un cadre classique (par exemple, du moment que les pertes ennemies sont supérieures aux siennes, il est inutile d'en faire trop au niveau des pertes du nord-vietnamien car elle sont rapidement reconstituées)

Card driven Game about Vietnam. Another occasion to learn again about this conflict.

A great game, with lots of tension and lots of choices for both players.  The rating would be higher, but the poorly written rulebook and a few unnecessarily fiddly rules bring it down a couple points.

2nd Edition.

I will buy the third edition the second it hits my local gaming store, provided that the rulebook is improved. The lack or clarity and the wording in the rulebook just gives room for so many questionable situations when playing. We had to constantly refer to boardgamegeek forums to find answers which really deducted from the experience. Killed my enthusiasm for the game.

At heart, this is a straight-forward game of fairly low complexity. For me, the rulebook fails at clearly explaining even some of the most basic concepts. I've read it 3 times plus additional downloadable content. And it is a short rulebook. To provide a reference, I need to read the average GMT-game, 25-30 page rulebook, once or sometimes twice before playing. Then I can play with the occasional rules reference for the first one or two games. I've dealt with far more complex games, and haven't experienced this kind of confusion. Unclear, poorly structured and often the core concepts are poorly worded. Left me feeling very angry and this was a game I was supposed to love, Vietnam CDG wargame.

Summary: I won't invest more of my time trying to iron out the rules. With a functional rulebook, I believe that this could be an 8 or 9 as the game has a lot of potential.

A great game illustrating how asymmetric warfare can arise even with broadly symmetric rules - and highly thematic.  Play it with the right soundtrack and you can almost smell the napalm.

This is a very fun game to play- cleverly designed with plenty of subtle nuances. I highly recommend this one.

My favorite card-driven wargame, based on the subject matter, an increased focus on combat (compared to other CDGs), the campaign cards, and general coolness.  More details will be forthcoming after additional plays.

It's too bad that Stan Hilinski isn't listed as a co-designer, as I know that Stan put a lot of work into reworking the game and writing/improving the rulebook.

A lot going on. Very interesting. Pacification is a priority over military actions. In other words, combat is conducted to support pacification. U.S. can win if they push where NVA/VC are not, hold where they are, and counter all VC pacification. Campaign cards are important. VC can win easily. VC pacification is a priority. Like U.S. push where the enemy is not. Campaign Cards help with this action. Exploit where there is growing victory, hold if U.S. launches operation against a strong position while starting to concentrate elsewhere.

A fun, light CDG.  A bit deterministic at times; the systems of the game, and the consequences of actions (both large and small) feel disconnected from each other, and I'm not certain how long of a life it's going to have, but I did have fun on my first outing.

Very good game on the conflict. Fairly meaty card driven game with lots of flavor. Some rules issues and some cards are confusing and need clarification from the geek but that does not drag down this title. One of the best on the subject.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent game.  Components a bit on the cheap side, but cards have a lot of historical context.  Nice mix of normal battles, VC ambushes, bomber and naval attacks, with a bunch of politics mixed in.

This is a great game, and every time I play I learn a little more on how to play it better. The game isn't about firepower or who can win battles it is who can control the "Hearts & Minds" of the Vietnamese people. Don't take my last statement to mean there are no battles or they are not important, just not the focus of how to win, especially for the Free World Allies (U.S. and other allies).

I have both the 1st and 2nd editions of the game, my 1st edition is up for trade to a good home.

Tense combat system where every expenditure of resources must be weighed against the political ramifications. The loss of too many US units will quickly erode support for the war, but too many ARVN casualties could trigger a Coup in South Vietnam. So ARVN units are necessary to soak up combat hits and protect US units, but they're often the primary target if the North is going for the Coup. US forces are powerful, with an array of support assets, but it's extremely dangerous to let them get caught up in an NVA meat-grinder.

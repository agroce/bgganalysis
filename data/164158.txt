Fun little word game, the compromise of the size keeps it from being as amazing as it could've been. But boy howdy, is this one a blast! Plays quickly, the limitation on speaking is great, and there's actually a challenge here that's still holding our attention after several plays. 

Will it stand up to repeated pressure and give me thirty great plays? No, but it's not meant to -- and it might give me a dozen. For the price of admission you should definitely check it out. Heck, we're already under a dollar a play!

Now SHH is brilliant. I love it. It's an amazing piece of design. It's a co-op game where you are collectively spelling words. Now stay with me (you already know I dislike spelling games). There are exactly 26 cards - one for each letter. The vowels (and Y) are placed in the middle, face up. You deal the other letters out to all players. This works well with 2 or more players. So here's what happens: on your turn, you play one letter. You can play a vowel from the middle instead. The next player has to *add* a letter to the end or score the word (if it is in fact a word). If they add a letter, the word gets longer. If you get past 5 letters and use a vowel, you can flip the vowel and make it worth 1 point. Vowels can be used repeatedly, but all the other letters score just one time and can only be used once during the entire game. There are a few 'pass' cards as well - but only a limited number. The idea? Make as many words as you can.

Oh and by the way? You can't talk during the game. At all. Hence the name. So you can play this game in the library. No problem.

It's a beautiful affair and even better than Hanabi in my estimation because it is so beautifully and elegantly crafted. We've managed to use all but 3 letters but I doubt you could ever use all the letters. But that's what makes it fun - a never ending challenge I think.

Another amazing game in such a tiny box.  This one is probably the winner of the lot, boasting a clever and flexible system with minimal components, and some of the most gorgeous modern graphic design to make it into the hobby.  Such a steal at its price.

Fun, though we thought too hard in the quest for a good score. I'd much rather have played more fast-and-loose (and scored more poorly) several times than agonized over the one play.

I have a problem with games with no winner or loser. In co-operativ games, I want to win or lose, not go for the most points (Hannabi, I’m looking at you). Shh falls in the same category. I love word games. I love coops. Just not this particular one.

I think this game is hugely sensitive to the number of players. With 2, you have perfect knowledge of what each person has. With repeated plays, players could fall into the trap of learning good words to play and it would become more of a logistic problem with who has what letters. With two, this game would probably lack replay value with the same group. With 4, I feel like it's the toughest player count because letters are spread over so many people. Three is probably the best player count because you don't have perfect information on letters, but you can take risks without it being as devastating as with 4. With three, it's still probably best to play with new people as often as possible.

RATING: 5
Kind of interesting spelling word puzzle cooperative game thing. Consonants are in players hands and vowels are on the table. Consonants are played once per game, vowels are played once per round. Words must be at least three letters; to score the vowels, they must be at least five letters.  As with most word spelling games, in casual play the dictionary ends up defaulting to "words people know", which can derail obscure words. Since all 21 consonants are in the game (Y counts as a consonant), it ends up being a game of figuring out how to dump the Qs, Zs, and Js with three letter words before getting down to business and getting proper 5 letter words with vowels.

I really like the graphic design of the cards in this game - it looks nice on the table.

Shh seems like it was heavily inspired by Hanabi. Since I'm not the biggest Hanabi fan (or of coops in general), I'm probably not the target audience. But it is challenging and a fun exercise. I don't completely grasp the full purpose of the voting. I enjoy the requirement to be silent, making shushing the other players a fun element of the game.

A simple word game where the challenge is in scoring the highest amount of points together and you're limited by the fact that you can only use each consonant of the alphabet once.  Passable at the table, but would be perfect as a travel distraction.

So far, this is my favorite entry in the POG series. It reminds me of Hanabi, only lighter and with a different focus. You need to be able to predict your friends' vocabularies, ability to spot words, and ability to make the right tactical choice in shifting circumstances -- and be able to leverage that ability yourself. For a 5-10 minute game, there's a lot going on, and I love that. We found ourselves playing a few in a row; it's got that just-one-more-game quality to it.

While the micro-cards work fine, I do with the font were larger and, in some cases, easier to distinguish from the background. It's not terribly hard to make out the letters, but the +1s are hard to spot and the letters could be easier to spot.

Different word game of collectively tring to make words without speaking of one's intentions.  Have to anticipate your partner.  Not enough cards in the deck to really make it work very well, but a clever idea that could use partnership play, perhaps, or a revamped card distribution, or different scoring mechanism.  Pretty good for such a small box.

update after 1 play, 4er: still good, but I think perhaps 3er will be best? With 4 the letters are spread out too much to be able to think of good words that will work.

---
1 play, 2er

It's a cooperative game -- BOO! I hate co-ops! Still, it's pretty clever. I don't think it's at its best with 2 since you know exactly what cards are in the other player's hand: you just have to be on the same wavelength and come up with the "right" word. I suspect it will be better, and more difficult (we got to 25 points 'cause Mary, despite years of Boggle, didn't know ZA was an actual word!), with more players. Oh, and you have to do this in silence -- no clues about what word you're working towards!

Neat design, but I don't dig the whole coop thing.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Put the 5 vowel cards and 2 PASS cards in the center. Divide the rest of the letters randomly amongst players. On your turn either add a letter to the word you're working on (from hand or the vowels), pass (if a face up pass is available -- flip it to face down), or score the word. 
Scoring:
- if >5 letters, all vowels used flip to the +1 side. 
- scored vowels returned to display
- scored consonants set aside
- if word illegal (no abbreviations or proper nouns allowed), game ends.
- then, start a new word.

The game ends when you can't play. Score 1VP per consonant, 1VP per vowel on the +1 side.

RATING: 6
This was the second of the "Pack O Gum" games I played and this is my favorite after playing 3-of-8 of them.  In this game each player is dealt a hand of consonant cards.  In the center of the table are cards for each vowel and one pass card per player.  Players take turns playing cards from their hands, adding a vowel, or passing as long as there is a pass card left to use.  A player may also "lock in" a word by starting a vote.  If it is a valid word the consonants are scored and if the word is 5 or more letters long the vowel is scored as well.  You're  trying to empty each player's hand and score the most points.

The constraint that makes this game a challenge and entertaining is also the thing that makes it difficult to play with certain people.  You aren't allowed to talk about the cards in your hand or possibilities with words.  I played this with a player who is incapable of playing by those constraints, if he sees somebody making a mistake or sub-optimal move he HAS to say something which kind of ruins the game.  But that is also what makes this the most intriguing of these games for me.  Not knowing what is in your partners' hands but still trying to get rid of what is in your hand and not trap your partners is enjoyable and has me thinking but the words and strategies I'm thinking don't always align with other players and I can't tell them what I'm thinking and vice versa.

I'm still turned off by the tiny form factor of the game.  I don't need to play games on the go, I'm able to socialize in other ways, and if I'm getting together for the purpose of playing games I would prefer larger components and a deeper rule set.  But for what it is it was fine.

A tiny, cooperative deduction word game. A very rare mix.

Difficulty: Beginner+
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tiny co-op word game featuring a deck of 26 cards, one for each letter. All consonants are dealt out and players must attempt to dispose of them by collaboratively building a word, one letter at a time. Vowel cards are always available and can be re-used, but only score at the end of the game if used in a word of at least five letters. Like Hanabi, a handful of pass cards allow skipping turns; once they're gone, there's no choice but to play a card or vote on the validity of the current word and start a new one.

There's an obvious hole in the rules where words are only checked for accuracy if one or more players vote them down, so it's quite easy for a group to cheat (or a group of terrible spellers to enable one another) but it all works reasonably well and gets hard quickly.

If I'm on the fence it's because I'm not totally convinced that the deduction element works. It's easy to know which cards are left but hard to know who has them. There's a good chance we're just terrible; nevertheless, it's one that would be hard to justify over Hanabi or others. Like most micro-games it might be just a bit too micro and not enough game.

Fun mix of game mechanics.  Worker placement, resource gathering, and area majority mix together in an engaging game that gives you a great return on time invested.  Enough decisions to keep everyone engaged, but not so many that it slows the game down.  Still, not a game I would bring out if players are susceptible to analysis paralysis because time between turns can kill the flow of this game.

The board and components are quite nice and I want to like this game more but just don't.

With area control games usually more players is better. With 5 players by the end of the game there is great competition for majority while being constrained by where you can build, however the game is way too long with 5 players and has too much down time. 

With 4 players but still using 5 districts there is less pressure on where you can build and going last on the final round seems very important. 

I'm sure I'll try this one more as it is popular with my group, and hopefully my opinion will improve.

RATING: 6
Certainly a very good game and one that I enjoyed. I was admittedly a bit disappointed in the variety of buildings (there aren't too many). I do like the thinking behind the guilds - and the added replayability. The double workers are rather interesting, but seems a touch forced somehow. It also is a bit longish and repetitive - although the end game does ramp up appropriately. So for me, not quite enough.

Colocación de trabajadores, mayorías, pequeña gestión de recursos, componentes expectaculares y un transfondo humorístico genial! (La mejor introducción a un juego que he leído xD) Muy buen juego para jugar a 4 o 5 jugadores que gusten los euros. La variedad de losetas de gremio crea partidas muy diferentes y también permite que haya o no puteo directo/más interacción entre los jugadores :)

RATING: 6
This game felt very similar to Agricola but lighter, however it ended up taking much longer (four hours).  Once behind it was very difficult to catch up and part of this was because there weren't as enough options which limited strategy compared to Agricola or Lords of Waterdeep which both employ a mechanic of opening up more spaces to place workers on as the game progresses.

The ability to affect other players during worker placement is limited to taking guilds as these are the only spots that are really fought over on a regular basis.  I found the buildings you could build was often too restrictive, having just one or two options in your hand for the majority of the game.

All in all it I liked the wood, stone, steel and money spots mechanic but it just felt like it went for far too long for a game with as limited options.

RATING: 4.9
I really liked the taxation rule that acts as a speed bump for players who are soaring in profits. Apart from that, it's a fairly standard (and quite dry) area control game, with a worker placement mechanic. The theme is very much pasted on, which is a shame, given the utterly fabulous art and general appearance of the game, and better connection of theme with mechanics might have given it a better rating from me, since there are some good ideas in it. Alas, as it is, I did not find it at all engaging; and it is far too long for what it offers.
However, it is early going in their careers for Messers Cormier and Lim. I look forward to their future offerings.

I think this is a good game WHEN YOU PLAY WITH THE EXPANSION. The role drafting adds just enough variety to the strategy and makes Belfort a lot more interesting than just the base game IMO. The expansion maybe pushes it to 8/10 for me.

I like the Euro, area control, engine building sort of thing going on here. It's definitely got some rough edges, but it is a good game with a fun theme (especially with the expansion assistants!).

BORING!

It feels like someone trying to reinvent the wheel by adding several square sides to it.
While I admire a few WP games (Agricola,Lords of WaterDeep, Fresco and Carson City, to be exact), I can't stand the hype for any boring release based on this mechanic.
Belfort also introduces a different kind of worker (WOW, how cool is that!), which can only be used only in specific places (WOW! Please allowed me to faint!)

BORING!

RATING: 7.5
A worker placement game with a low fantasy theme and cool artwork. Players are collecting resources and then use them to build various buildings while trying to have majority in the city districts. The game works fine and the rules are clear.

I really like the turn order system. Usually going first is great but in the resource collecting part of the game it is best to go last. So it evens out.

My minor complain is that I didn't see something new and innovative in this game. If you like worker placement and area majority then you will love Belfort.

Really fun worker placement game... the area majority aspect adds a cool level of relatively direct conflict that takes it above other games of this mechanic/genre for me.

Great components, interesting scoring system, and variable guilds (classified by gameplay type!) to keep each game fresh... The game has a subtle sense of humor throughout that I really enjoyed, as well.

A fairly basic worker placement game that provides many paths (and really encourages you via victory point bonuses) to get extra workers.  You also get to collect resources and build buildings that both allow you to do cool things AND place a building on the board to help you win one of the five area majority competitions which are done in three of the seven rounds (IIRC). 

One quibble with the design:  I did not enjoy the circle and square workers with stickers on them; if they had been in more thematic shapes, I think the game would have been greatly improved.

High AP warning!

Maybe we should had played with the beginner set of guilds instead of the normal one in the first play, but it feels like the interactive elements are too strong and hamper the whole thing to a snail pace. Economic engines were slowed down so much that in the end we all ended up with almost the same amount of points (difference of 1st and 4th place was 2 points).

I would like to try again, but I was a little bit disappointed. Next time without i-guilds I think.

EDIT: Second play was with 5 players and we didn't use i-guilds. Game works better this way but in the end it's just too long for what it offers.

There was nothing particularly remarkable about this one and it just feels too wide open with 2 players. I have zero interest in trying it again.

Surprising game that has both worker placement and area control.  Initially was off put by the graphics, but enjoyed it tremendously.  The set number of turns really keeps the game to a playable time.  There can be a bit of AP during each of the scoring rounds though, when the players have to calculate the optimal zone of the city to place in.

One criticism is the linear nature of the game.  There seems to be a lot of down time between players.

Fun game. While it utilizes a worker placement mechanic, I would definitely not group it with other worker placement games. It is more about area control than worker action efficiency. One player could get much more resources in the game and still lose because they get outplayed in the board control.

Update: The expansion corrects all complaints I had on the original game (which weren't much). Namely it greatly mixes up the player order advantage. In the base game going first early can be a HUGE advantage - however if you get stuck in a player turn order swap war you'll be a HUGE disadvantage. The expansion makes it so there are more incentives to be last player. I think this creates a better overall balance to the game, and now player turn order swaps become a lot more strategic and less prone to the player getting screwed because he kept having people take his place order.

With the expansion this is probably my favorite area control game that I have on my shelf. Recommend with 4 players even though it plays 5.

An enjoyable worker placement/area control game.  I like the small change over a typical Euro by changing what could have been carpenters/masons/apprentices to elves/dwarfs/gnomes.

RATING: 7
Belfort can be a tad hard to convince people about.  Its fantasy theme is light and whimsical, yet under the veneer is a good area control game.  Game play is also surprisingly deep and this can clash with the theme.  Don't let any theme vs mechanisms debate keep this game from the table.  It is a solid title that will hold surprises under a cover of illusions.

Belfort is a game that seems tailored around my tastes.
It's a clever mix of worker placement and area control, with a very nice presentation and artwork to support: there is nothing new in Belfort, but everything is smoothly assembled and flows very well during play.
The only drawbacks, if one wants to nitpick, are the relative tendency to analysis paralysis (in worker placement you want to go first, in area control you want to go last... so turn order jokeying is important, but when you're not first or last you have to carefully consider your options!) and the close-to-zero opportunity to corner your opponents with clever play (the interactive guilds are more a screw-you directly thing).
Belfort however has many positive qualities: different ways to play the game, variable initial set-up, an increasing number of options during the course of the game...
If the game was shorter (around the 90 min. mark), it would be a true masterpiece, with the actual lenght, it is good but not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Tried the base game and I am very happy with this latest acquisition. I like the interactions between the players and how all the players are trying to gain majority in each of the 5 districts through build buildings.

At first I thought that if you do not take building cards you are quite dead and there is nothing you can do, but I realised that you can actually build walls AND guilds that would help sustain the majority.

The 2 player version is great and not a brain burner where you control 2 additional players where some games ask you to. So I think this game is going to get lots of replayability with 5 guilds that are used each turn. Great game.

RATING: 8
I love this game. I've played this game at least 12 times. Worker placement games normally bore me but there is a lot more going on in this one. Its got a clever area control mini game going on that makes you feel clever when you get it to work for you. The recipe fulfillment mechanic that requires you to gather certain resources to build your buildings is fun and makes you optimize your long term plans. The residual income you get from some of your builders scratches my economic itch. I still enjoy playing this game and the variable set up makes it a little different each time.

Love how everything comes together in this game.  The game isn't a gateway game, but it looks cutesy and innocent enough where people aren't intimidated from wanting to try it out.  Win or lose, people usually like the experience and want to try again.

[i]Posted: 2/15/12, Rated: 9[/i]
{2P: ?, 3P: ?, 4P: ?, 5P: 9}

[i]Belfort[/i] feels like it could be a city in the [i]Harry Potter[/i] mythos, or perhaps more appropriately in the faerie world of [i]Artemis Fowl[/i].  You are seeking to gain the most influence over the city with your Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes.

At first glance [i]Belfort[/i] is a worker placement game with different types of workers.  This is an interesting start.  I can't recall another game that has different workers: in [i][thing=34635]Stone Age[/thing][/i] they're all the same.  Ditto [i][thing=24480]The Pillars of the Earth[/thing][/i].  Meeples are contextually different in [i][thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing][/i], but their roles vary throughout the game.

Worker placement equals resource management.  Four different resources (wood, stone, metal, and gold) are gathered to do something, which in this case means constructing buildings.  Buildings which have been constructed can be activated à la [i][thing=18602]Caylus[/thing][/i], [i][thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing][/i], and the like.  Normally, buildings are constructed to do something, only now we're not adding to a cathedral, or the king's palace; The buildings themselves are a means to an end.

For [i]Belfort[/i] really is an area control game.  Each building you place goes somewhere on the city.  You can choose the "quarter" (although there are five sections), and place your marker on a matching building there.  The players with the first- and second-most markers in each quintile earn points.  [i]This is the central point-scoring mechanic of the game, and it's easy to overlook![/i]  For while you are planning your builds, tallying your resources, and marshaling your workers, it is easy to lose sight of the ultimate goal: to obtain a scoring plurality in as many quintiles as you can.

For me, all of these mechanisms gel together effortlessly.  My mind instinctively groks how the game works, and therefore it is a lot of fun.  The fantasy theme adds just the right touch of whimsy to keep [i]Belfort[/i] from feeling like work.  The powers provided by the Guilds help to keep each game fresh.  It's a wonderful combination of seemingly heavy mechanisms in a single box with a reasonable playing time.  It's almost like a fairy tale.

Amazing game at 4 or 5 player levels.
Looking forward to the expansion that I kick- started.

Edit: 2nd January 2014
With the Expansion Expansion, elevates Belfort to a solid 9 for me.
Have to play at lower player counts of 3 and 2 to see if it makes those player numbers shine so bright also - if so, rating will go up.
If you own Belfort - buy the Expansion - it rocks!

Edit: 29th December 2017

Having replayed Belfort at 3 player, without the expansion...and having played countless games over the last few years, to compare [Microbadge=20607] too - this game is a solid 9. 
A real gem in the collection.

After playing several recent games and now including the expansion again, this is a near perfect game. Rating raised to 9.6

First play: There is a fair amount to take in from the rules and a clear structured approach to explaining is essential.

Once in this is the sort of game where you are always 1 resource or coin away from your ideal move and an early trip can set you back the whole game. From that respect its quite brutal. There is a definite need to keep the leader pegged back.

I like its lack of compromise. I think I'll have to buy this one.

Looking forward to playing again with the Guild Promo pack thrown into the mix. Awesome components as well!

I feel like the game has me do the same thing every game: each round get enough resources to build a building, build it, and repeat. I believe most of the game lies in the placement of the houses on the board, but that part doesn't engage me incredibly well. I also feel that the sessions I've played have lasted a bit longer than what it's worth to me.

Good mix between a worker placement and area control. Very good quality of components, funny graphic design, solid gameplay. I don't recommend playing it in 2 (loses part of the race for the spot in the city) or 5 (too much downtime). 4 is the perfect spot.

Like many worker placement games, it forces you to plan a whole turn in advance to making your first placement. This adds to the AP. Too much micro optimization required.

RATING: 6
After one play, I feel like this is a decent area majority game with worker placement.  I felt like the length of our session (it took too long) detracted from the enjoyment of the game.  Otherwise, I found it pretty interesting and fun.  I was a bit disappointed in the lack of difference between elves and dwarves.  They are different for gathering resources and otherwise identical.

After two plays, I've decided that this is an excellent game with a potential downtime issue.  Both 4-player games I played took around 3 hours.  Had they taken 2 hours, I would have been totally satisfied.  Instead, I was just somewhat satisfied.  It is a good game... just wish it could go faster.

After the third play, I've confirmed that the downtime is too much in this game.  I felt like I barely participated in my last play, but I still finished second by just a couple points.  I really like how the game works except for the downtime.

This may well have the [i]best[/i] player board/player aide ever included in any game. Just about everything you need to know is right there. The only thing which wasn't there that we missed the first game was the limits on some of the city cards, like the Gatehouse. All-in-all, a wonderfully rule set and game reference set. The game's also pretty darned good, too.

Rating after the first playing. May be a 7 over time and I can't see it dropping lower unless we did something horribly wrong, which I doubt.

1 játék - 3 játékos: Vegyes érzelmekkel zártam a játékot, mindamellett, hogy nyertem. Keveslem a munkáslehelyezési lehetőségek sokszínűsékét. Mindemellett úgy érzem, hogy ez egy tipikusan sok gondolkodással bíró játék, mert a kevés lehetőséget mégis a leggazdaságosabban kell kivitelezni. Nem is a lehetőségek miatt kell gondolkodni, hanem azon, hogy melyik a legfontosabb és nehogy lefoglalják. A játék végére kifejezetten nehéz és feszültséggel - nem személyes - teli játéknak éreztem, de összességében kipróbálnám 4 vagy 5 játékossal, mert akkor nagyobb a küzdelem. A játékot változatossá teszi az is, hogy mindig változnak a céhek és ezáltal teljesen más stratégiát kell használni.

Sokkal jobb lett a játék. Mérföldekkel jobb 4 fővel játszani és elmondhatom, hogy rengetek lehetőséget és újrajátszást rejt magában.

Very underrated game. Also has one of the best little mechanics for area control with 2P that I've run across. It's a great worker placement/area control hybrid. Really like this one a lot. It runs a little long for what it is which is what keeps it from getting more plays.

It's a very interesting blend of worker-placement and scoring through majorities. The initial building of your engine is fun, but I feel there should have been some more ways to score points besides getting area majorities through buildings. The last two turns revolved around building only for the sake of placing the token on the board and it felt a little weird and unfitting.

The first game from TMG I purchased, and the reason I still believe that they can produce good games when they choose to.

  I really enjoy the multiply types of workers and the added bonus of upgraded workers! In my opinion this nice multi-tiered worker system more than makes up for the rather simplistic worker placement aspects of this game. The game is rounded out very nicely by the tight area control on the game board, that adds a nice brain burning aspect to this game. 

  The scoring is also great in my opinion, with the tax mechanic both preventing runaway leaders and also breaking the pack up by forcing players to fall out of contention if they can't keep up with other players.

  I can't speak highly enough of this game, and my largest criticism is that it's not the only great game out there, and can be moderately hard to get to the table with my play groups.

A beer and pretzels style area majority game that takes too long to play. You build an economic engine (e.g., recruiting more guys) and then go for VPs. The 2-3 guilds that let you steal from all opponents turn it into a painful, "take that" type of game. Supposedly, if you play without these guilds, it's a better game.

Local game is a big plus! Unfortunately the structure of turns can leave you twiddling your thumbs for 30 minutes during your first play through with 5 newbies. I'll need to play it again to re-evaluate my opinion, but the lack of hidden scoring left me well aware I had lost mid game and just hoping people would hurry up and make decisions so it could end. Not a good game for slow players... Need to play it again with some fast ones!

An area control game, with a worker placement mechanic, set in a medieval/fantasy world where your workers are dwarfs and gnomes.

One of the two best 2-player meaty, thematic, worker placement games that is fun and the only one that also has area control (the other game is Agricola).

My initial opinion is that 2-player may be the sweet spot for this game but I'm not sure and it played excellently with 3 and I think the AP in 4 was probably due to the players (Bruce plus 2 noobs).  This game is definitely not an gateway game.

OK game with really nice looking boards and pieces.  I really wanted to like this game more.  The game play is good with some interesting decisions and choices to make, but at the end of the day it really is too long for the amount of actual game that is involved.  Our first game toll 2 hours & 15 minutes.  AP was there with 2 players, but really would probably have only made 15 minutes difference in total.  I would play again, but I think there are a lot more interesting worker placement/resource management games out there.

Es un juego de colocación de trabajadores. Al principio únicamente te puedes colocar en unas pocas posiciones en el tablero, pero a medida que avanza el juego te puedes ir colocando en ubicaciones que te dan las cartas que vas construyendo. 
Cuando ya has colocado tus trabajadores, los que no has colocado los utilizas para pasar y obtener recursos (también se colocan, en otro tablero). Además, en la obtención de recursos hay competición de mayorías.
Se realizan tres puntuaciones en todo el juego y se valoran las mayorías de edificaciones en cada uno de los sectores y la mayoría de los diversos tipos de trabajadores (hay tres:mineros, elfos y enanos).

Al principio puede resultar un poco confuso, pero cuando cojes la mecánica es un buen quemacerebros.

El juego viene con varias losetas de gremios de las cuales sólo se usan cinco en cada partida, para dar jugabilidad. 
Hay una expansión que ofrece además elección de roles y cartas para mejorar las cartas ya existentes, y alguna loseta de gremio más interactiva.

Played first game. Unfortunately, I won that game, so I am afraid it will likely not get played again soon. As a 2 player experience, I think this one is not perfect. The worker placement is quite tight, so that is good. Similarly, with two dummies, the building placement is also competitive. The problem is that in the area majority, one vs. one just seems rather dull. I suspect this aspect of the game would be much more exciting with more players.

Deceptively challenging game: don't let the cute elves and gnomes fool you! Although there is a lot of resource gathering/engine building, the game is fundamentally an area control game, which is easy to forget if you're used to other WP games. Area majority is critical for points, but too much of an early lead can also cripple you because of taxes. I have still not figured out a decent winning strategy, so I have to play a few more times before I'm comfortable with my rating.

As an aside, the level of detail and flavor text on the board and cards is wonderful, from the warning of "Yeti attacks" down to the "ent-free" ruler and the "Clipboard Makers' Guild." Yes, the game is adorable, but it belies a much tougher game.

Belfort is an excellent worker placement/area control game.  This is a bit of a gamer's game - one must plan a turn or two ahead, there are plenty of stressful decisions and lots of bits to keep track of.  Still, I love it.

The components are beautiful and the gameplay is interesting and strategic - definitely a personal favorite.

Seems like there's quite a bit of strategic depth here while also maintaining a very simple set of rules, which is very cool!

At first, the area majority portion of the game seemed very disjointed from the engine-building portion.  It still seems like kind of a weird match, but it works and manages to be pretty fun!

The game length gets a little on the long side, with the play time on the box being a bit ambitious, but the time goes quickly so I can live with that.

Overall, a really cool worker placement game with some twists to make it different enough from the other fare out there.

Belfort is a game which really surprised me – I knew it was good, but not this good! I’m a HUGE fan of eurogames and my favorite mechanic is worker placement. My second is probably area majority. This game does what very, very few have done before: it uses WP and AM in the same game, and it does so in a beautiful way.

It seems rather simple on the surface – and perhaps it is, but there are actually a lot of decisions you need to make and those aren’t that simple! 

The 5 different guilds are chosen among 12 (and 3 additional promos), so you cannot follow a certain strategy by using X guild in each game. I really like the three kinds of guilds, though I’ve mostly played with the B and R guilds; the I (interactive) are very mean and can really mess up other players’ plans! You can also mess with people’s plans when you are the last player to place your workers to get resources as the player with the most of the elfs/dwarves in each of the 4 resource areas gets a bonus resource – so, if you’re going first, the players after you can make sure you don’t get that bonus! And that’s a huge advantage of not being the starting player:

I  like the advantages of being first, but there are also some disadvantages which evens it out, especially the resource collecting aspect mentioned above. And if you really are tired of being last, well, just use an elf/dwarf and be the starting player next round (or, at least move up in the turn order). It’s great to be first player in order to be able to take advantage of the best spots on the board (ie. the guilds). On the other hand, it’s not that good to be the first one to build as the others can screw you over when placing their buildings, so it’s nicely balanced I think. In 2-3p I actually think it’s better to go last in the final round, but in 4-5p it’s probably best to be first or in the middle or so as you might end up getting shut out of the places you want to build your buildings and hence getting fewer points!

Which leads me to the next thing I like about it; the scoring and how to get points. It’s quite simple – you play 7 rounds and score in round 3, 5 and 7. You only score for area control and for having many workers, and that’s it! Simple, but great. Also, as there are only 3 scoring rounds, you need to get some points in all of them, but if you get too many too early, you’ll have to pay a higher amount of taxes which again shows how the game is balanced.

Oh, and I think the theme and the components are great! Not that I usually care for theme and components as the game mechanics are definitely what I’m looking for, but it never hurts to be visibly different from the majority of games. It’s a great game I can recommend to fans of eurogames centered about worker placement and area majority! The biggest downside to the game is probably the playing time; it almost always takes 2-3 hours to play even though there aren't any extremely hard decisions to be made (as there is in Agricola or other heavier games). This is actually the reason why I have downgraded my rating slightly and eventually sold my copy; it is a very good game, but it just takes too long for what it is. Still, I would gladly play it again.

My recommended number of players: 3, 4, 5

One of my favorite games. TMG always produces great quality and carefully ensures that they are publishing games with great gameplay, interesting mechanics, and beautiful components. This game is so exciting to play and I have never played a game with a breakaway leader.

Great example of collect and build, resource management, and area control.

Probably one of my favorite "area control" games, as it combines great "worker placement" qualities to the game as a whole.  I also like the idea of creating buildings to give you better benefits throughout the game, and having "garden gnomes" doing the work for you adds a neat bonus.

Overall, a very pleasing game to me, and one that needs to be played more often that it currently stands.

Tentative rating.  I'm a little unconvinced after my first play.  It seemed like there were some not-so-useful guilds, and there was a lot of just passing to get resources.

Warning: do not drive or operate heavy machinery while playing.

The high-concept pitch for this is "Worker Placement Meets Area Majority" except the worker placement side of it lacks even a modicum of tension or serious decision making -- like all of the Lite Worker Placement joints that are currently in vogue, I find myself asking "what does this add to the already perfectly adequate if not wonderful Worker Placement games I already know and like?" With Belfort, the answer is: [i]jack squat[/i].

I mean, there's room in the world of games for a game that's like Agricola but a little less complex, but the games I've tried have attempted to do so by nerfing (Stone Age) or lobotomizing (Belfort) the competition for worker placements.

As for the Area Majority aspect, there's really very little if any reason to favor one segment of the board over another in the early game, and your hand of cards is sufficiently constraining on your late-game decisions to the point where you're just collecting arbitrary numbers of cubes to build arbitrary buildings to collect points.

To be fair: this is a fine, mostly harmless game. It's pretty. It's lighthearted. The components are great. The theme is dull and generic but it gets in the way of nothing. In a vacuum, I suspect I would find this to be a fun enough game. In our universe, the one where Agricola and Le Havre and Caylus exist, I have a not-unreasonable demand that any game that follows on from them do something interesting they don't do. Belfort ... doesn't.

There's alot to like about this game.  I don't ordinarily like area control games, but everything seems to just work in this game.

The main problem I have with this game is that it's too short.  I've tried playing a few extra turns, but everything falls apart due to exponential growth.  I would really love to play a similar game that lasts a bit longer.

Absolutely nothing new here. Suckered in by the nice art (and rating reflects a +1 because of it). Nothing terribly wrong with it (so long as you stay away from the Interactive guilds), but there's nothing really interesting going on either. As a territory control game, the territories are a little too static. The Interactive guilds are apparently meant to address that, but the way they do it is completely whacked.

Simplistic scoring makes the game accessible, but I was hoping for scoring based up the building types rather than the wedge of the city. I've only played once, but the leader was ahead the whole game. He had played before and the only other player who had played did nothing to stop him and finished in last place. The bits are of a good quality. If I am to play a Worker Placement game, I'll make it Manhattan Project, Agricola, or Le Havre.

Belfort good resource puzzler.  There are not a lot of game turns, but it's not a short play.  The components are good, and it's a fun play.  

There are a couple things I'm not crazy about, though.  The luck factor is high with the card draws.  The amount of cards you draw means that you have fewer options as the game goes on.  So you end up being a slave to the cards you draw with respect to what resources you need to puzzle out.  The strategic placement for area control is nice, but could be better if the cards didn't limit your options as much.

So...my conclusion is that Belfort would be a fun family game, but not so great for serious gamers.  In a family setting you would get a nice rich game, and the weaknesses are not going to stand out like a sore thumb.

Overall I really like everything that's going on in Belfort.  The only real downside is that it's pretty crunchy with its math and seems unforgiving of mistakes. Still, I love how the game successfully blends together worker placement and area control.  Early you tend to pick building that give you the abilities you need and later you are more interested in getting in on areas to score points.  It's a cool balance.

Ehhh, it's not bad, but there are just so many other "good" games out there, so why play one that is just "okay"?

The theme and art makes it a light-hearted workers-(elves, dwarves and gnomes)-building-a-city game. There's worker placement. There's resource collection. There's spending resources to build buildings. There's area majority in buildings and in each worker category. There's also some jockeying for turn order. There's not much else, really. 

Okay to try out, but I'm not interested in playing it again.

Sort of an interesting game where you have different types of workers able to do different jobs. You also build buildings which provide income and an area control aspect on the city board.

The components are excellent and the theme is fun.

Two-player is not so great... there are two dummy players, which you can somewhat manipulate to your advantage.

Unfortunately, there's a lot of downtime with 5 players.

Since I'm nearly always playing either exactly two players or exactly five, this one may get neglected.

UPDATED: Played with 3 today and still seemed to have more downtime than the game feels like it should. Still, a lot of interesting and fun things happening... so I've got mixed feelings. No doubt it's a really good game, but it just drags a little (particularly the last turn or two).

It's long, but it combines area majority with worker placement in a way that I find more enjoyable than in Age of Empires, which is my only other encounter with that combination. It also brings out the AP in me, a disorder with which I am not usually afflicted. The game may be on few eurogamers' top ten lists, but it is so quintessentially a euro that I find it hard to imagine a eurogamer disliking it.

I like the bits and the art style of this one, and the building of Belfort makes sense thematically, which is also a big plus for me.

Belfort is an area majority game, but the focus on game play is driven by worker placement and resource management elements.  It is a very beautiful game to look at, and also engaging to play. The rules are very simple in many ways, but there are also a few unintuitive rules that take a while to wrap your head around.  It's unfortunate, because it would be very easy to iron out the wrinkles.  There is also the possibility of AP with some players, leading to long downtime in between turns.  But there is so much going for the game, that it is very easy to forgive it for there minor shortfalls.

Belfort seems to have a good amount of replayability. I highly recommend trying it.  TMG continues to impress me with solid games.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed my one play of this however remain a little undecided about my long term view of the game. It's a slightly forgiving worker placement/action selection game with some board placement elements as well - i.e. the board is not just a series of holding boxes for workers/actions etc.

In our game one of the special buildings allowed for the movement of buildings owned between areas, which added a fair bit of dynamism to the board element - which was a good thing. Normally this will be missing so the board becomes static which I suspect would turn it into one of the fiddly worker-placement/action-selection cube-pushing/conversion games that I'm starting to find tiresome - 'Dungeon Petz', Vanuatu are some recent examples.

So a 7 on first play but I suspect future games would see that fall probably as far as a 5. Perhaps, however, the other variable buildings will allow this to retain some interest.

These type of Euro's are essentially abstract exercises but with a stack more rules than you get from a true abstract game, in order to convey an arbitrary theme which the game does not go on to evoke anyway, as there is no real narrative element to the game - all you've done is push some cubes.

Starting this out at an 8. Not sure it will rise in rankings and may drop a point or 2.  We played the beginner game.  The "take that" guilds that are in the Normal and Advanced game look to be such a huge random element that I'm not sure any strategy/planning can be successful.  I guess you have to look at it like El Grande with the some of the screwage.

I've played this with 5 and 3 players.  We used all of our houses in the 3 player game and the 5 player game felt like maybe it was too many players.  Perhaps the sweet spot for this game is 4 players?

RATING: 5
I suspect that a couple of years ago, when I was slightly less discriminating in my tastes, I would have been pretty excited about Belfort. It has a fairly novel combination of worker placement and majority building, with scoring being based entirely on getting majorities in the game’s five districts and three types of workers. There are both shared and individual action spots where you can place your workers, to get bonuses and the ones that are available have a reasonably large impact on resource scarcity and just how much you can impact your opponent’s relative positions. 

So if it has these relatively interesting qualities, why am I rating it a 5? Essentially I find the design to be just a little bit too clean, a bit too milquetoast for my tastes. There are too few sharp edges, too few opportunities to put your opponents into tough situations where they are forced to either choose between two equally bad decisions or make them take decisions that help you as much as them. The game just did not give me enough of a reason to care about the decisions being provided beyond the general sense that I should be trying to win. As it is, if I want to play a majorities-focused worker placement game I think I would probably pull out Dominant Species.

RATING: 4
Players represent master builders, charged with constructing the town of Belfort.  Players take turns placing their elf and dwarf workers out around Belfort, to gather in resources (wood, stone, metal, money) and use the special abilities of the town guilds.  Players can also recruit more elves and dwarves to get more stuff done.  Income is then earned, and players are taxed based on their victory point level in the game.  The meaty bit is actions, where players trade, hire gnomes to unlock buildings, and construct buildings via playing and paying for cards, and placing a house on a corresponding location on the playing board.  Guilds and walls can also be built, again placing houses on the board.  This is repeated over seven turns, with three turns triggering a scoring phase.  Scoring is based on majorities of houses in the five guilds of Belfort, as well as majorities in each of elves, dwarves and gnomes.  Most victory points after seven turns wins.  This is an ambitious beast - worker placement, economic engine and area majority scoring.  To me, it gets about 75% of it right - it feels engrossing to play, you always want to do more and you'll always be short of something.  The bits that feel off are the lengthy playtime - we're talking north of two hours here, and these days games have to be exceptional to justify that length.  Also, area majority open scoring means you can precisely calculate the result, which gives games a tendency to bog down as things are worked out and fingers are pointed (anyone remember Vinci?).  Overall, a nice attempt, and full marks for the production - it looks magnificent.

A nice, light worker placement. The game pace is fast enough that the game ends up feeling shorter than the 1h30 it actually takes to play, but is simple enough that it can be picked up relatively quickly by most player. 
If you've played worker placement games before, it will be a snap to pick up as the game doesn't really have any quirks to it.
Fun and light.

First Impressions - Fun theme, great components, great art, and the rulebook is done so well that it deserves a mention. Like most people who play this realize, it is more of an area control game with a large side of worker placement. My wife and I enjoyed our first play of this game, and I hear it's even better with more players. 

But, there were a couple minor parts of the game that seemed superfluous or non-intuitive to us and our personal gaming tastes - scoring points for number of workers, and collecting income between 2 sets of retrieving  workers. These seem to have been added as a way to balance the game or add strategic choices, but we didn’t feel like they were integrated into the theme/feel of the game as well as we would have liked. But, those are minor issues in an overall enjoyable game.

Played our 2nd game. The playtime is definitely longer than what we can fit into our schedules at the moment. It's a little sad that a 2 hour game is too long, but it couldn't really be any shorter without the game feeling like it was ending before it was over (if that makes any sense). Also, the game was a little more complex than my wife and I can handle (which unfortunately doesn't take much with us when being distracted by the kids). I like a nice challenge, but I  was frustrated because I found myself making unforced errors simply because I couldn't keep track of all the variables in my head. That will probably fix itself with more plays, but... Unfortunately, the play length combined with the complexity of the game means that we won't be getting it to the table much in the near future.

I've got to admit that seeing the designers and publisher come on here and rate their own game a 10 has really diminished my interest in purchasing this game.

From reading the rules, it looks like a well-done worker placement/area control game.  It looks like it would be pretty pleasant, but nothing really new.  Probably the gnome-locking mechanism strikes me as the most interesting aspect.  A lot of people seem to think it runs too long, which concerns me, but only a little.  

I'd like to play this sometime to try it!  However, it doesn't seem interesting enough right now for me to buy it.

Played a demo game.  Area control aspect was cool. Game is very subject to AP. I wish there was not majority rule on the resource collection, this really slows down the game as you need to wait for the person to calculate out exactly what resources they need when they "pass".  If there was no majority rule on resource collection, the game would move a lot quicker.  I do think once people get the hang of this, it will move quicker.

Like the game and components, its big though.  There are a lot of moving bits and I think turn order is a bigger deal then it should be.  There is NO catch up mechanic.  So if you are losing early there is little you can do but sit to wait for the (2hour) game to be over.

Game is like a work of art to look at and the components are high quality.  It plays very differently from any other game I have played as it's a mix of WP and AC.  Game can have some AP issues but the mechanics are solid apart from I felt I was building for the AC aspect of the game and not really using the building's ability.  The game possibly could of done with one more round as it felt over too quick for me.  Overall an enjoyable game.

Mert h vannak benne nyelvfüggő elemek: a céhlapok, de ezekből egyrészt játékonként csak 5 fent, másrészt meg jelek is, szóval könnyen érthető. Illetve a játékostáblán van egy összefoglaló is, játszás könnyítésnek,(nem külön lapra tették) de hát ha tudja az ember játszani, akkor ennek úgysincs jelentősége.
A többi lap nem nyelvfüggő, vagy szinte minimális mértékben (pl: only once felirat pirossal).
A játékszabály elég logikus, és elég egyszerű:
először a munkabesoztsás: embereim elküldöm adott helyekre ténykedni, ekkor csak az akciót/nyersanyagot választom meg, nem hajtom végre, "foglalom" a helyet: a nyersanyagok kivételével ugyanis 1 helyre egy munkás mehet. A nyersanyag helyre már csak akkor pakolja le a játékos a munkásait, ah passzol: azaz az összes megmaradt emberét elküldi nyersanyagokat szerezni. (2 féle munkás, nem tudja mindegyik mindegyiket termelni, s van ahol a kettő párban kell. Aki többségben lesz egy adott nyersanyagon, az bónuszként még 1 olyat kap.). 
A második rész, amikor kiértékeljük a nyersanyag táblát, h ki mit kap (nyersanyagot, embert, játékos sorrend -ez utóbbi jó ötlete: nem első helyre kerülsz, hanem aki elsőként tesz oda, az elveszi vki jelzőjét, cserébe odaadja az övét, azaz nem tolódik, hanem csak 2 ember helyet cserél...) majd bevétel és adózás.
A harmadik rész az akciók végrehajtása: tetszőleges sorrendben bármennyi akciót kijátszik a játékos,  leszámítva az új épületkártya elvételét: az utolsóként teheti meg a játékos, utána már nem hajthat végre több akciót, s a következő játékos akciózik.
Az akciók: egyrészt a lefoglalt akciók, pl céhekből származók, másrészt épületépítés (bmennyit, nyersanyag és kedv függő), harmadrészt gnómok felbérlése (egyes épületekhez nagy szükség van: aktiválja, elérhetővé teszi azok spec tulajdonságát, de körönként csak 1 gnómot lehet felbérelni), negyedik a piacozás (1 eladásra és 1 vételre van lehetőség).
Az épületépítés a lényeg: ezzel fogjuk a kastély egyes fertályaira bepakolni a házaink, az 5 fertályban ugyanazon épület típusok vannak, mindegyikben ugyanannyi mindegyikből. Ezek fogják a pontot hozni: értékeléskor (a játék során 3x) ezek többségi kiértékelési történik meg. Na és persze az egyes munkás fajok többségi értékelési is pontot hoz ekkor.
Ilyen egyszerű :-)
Ugyanakkor a céhek változatosságot adnak, eleve csak 5 kerül fel, de jóval több van, másrészt azok típus is különböző: van alap, van nyersanyag, és van interaktív típusú céh: szóval bmilyen kombinációban lekerülhetnek, ami teljesen átalakíthatja a játék felépítését egy előző partihoz képest.

RATING: 8
I avoided this game because I was not a fan of the artwork. It looked dumb and well, gnomes aren't really all that awesome in my book.  But enough research led me to believe that this would be a game I enjoy, and it did not disappoint.

What a brain burner!  A bit long in the tooth, but supposedly the expansion fixes that (we didn't try it yet, but it's on the docket).

This is not a worker-placement game, though, and this is precisely why I liked it so much.  Make no mistake - if that's what you want in a game, move on.  This is an area majority game through and through, with a little worker placement on the side.  You can really only be blocked on the guilds that are randomly distributed on the board.  Everything else is up for grabs which means your true strategy is managing your resources and building a decent income engine so you can keep expanding.  Although it feels that the game can take hours because people are thoroughly looking at their options, it still feels like the end comes too soon and you haven't accomplished anything you wanted to do.

Just like a proper game ought to.

A solid combination of majority and worker placement. Modular guilds will ensure some replay ability. Nice presentation. It seems Tasty Minstrel has learned their lesson with Homesteaders as far as printing is concerned. Unfortunately, Belfort is going into my second tier of worker/majority games. What is keeping it from going higher is the length-to-decision ratio is a little too high. I also felt that the taxes mechanic did not do enough to allow players an opportunity to catch up. It is a pretty interesting mechanic, though.

A worker-placement driven euro with resource management that is primarily about area control - familiar euro mechanics but integrated in a new way, and an unusual (for a euro) fantasy theme.  A highly polished product in every respect: artwork, components, theme, mechanics, humour, rules.  Only downsides are length/downtime with full complement of players (especially AP types).  Very impressive game.

This game had some elements I liked but the area majority scoring felt like a letdown rather than the high point of the game's arc, so it started off interesting to me but then fell flat. Some of the guilds went unused and the area control aspect felt stale. I did like the resource gathering and construction of buildings but, my buildings weren't a unique path in any way nor were there synergies among them. More different buildings that would allow players to differentiate their powers would be more interesting IMO as would scoring outside of the insipid area majorities.

An overly-long, extremely repetitive, area majority euro.

Rating history: 3

Played 1 time.
3p - 1

1st play: 3. SEP/14. The mechanics themselves aren't terrible, and feel like a busy light-middleweight euro, but the gameplay does not evolve at all, and goes on for 90 minutes. Why wouldn't I just play Agricola (worker placement) or El Grande (area influence) or Castles of Burgundy (euro point salad)? There are literally 300 games I would rather play that are either shorter (with similar feel), more variable (in the same timeframe), or offer more evolving gameplay. Terribly dull.

7-31-2012

Players: 2-5
Duration: 120 minutes
Type: worker placement & area control

What I appreciate most about the game is the balance--going first has a huge advantage, as does going last, and all the spots in between.  When someone chose to exchange places, we never knew what spot they would choose.  Even in the last round when we all thought last place would be best, It turned out that all the Gnomes were taken by the first two and the last person couldn't build all he wanted.  When one person went for the most Elves & Gnomes, another worked toward fewer but more valuable workers; one went for money to exchange for goods & workers, another concentrated on buildings, while another used most of his actions to mess & interact with others.  That made it a very interesting game and one person's actions tended to counter balance another's.

Re-playability is increased because there are 15 Guilds, only 5 of which enter a game, so when chosen randomly that makes every game very different because the Guilds very much change the direction of the game.

Even though I find the box unattractive, I think the game & board is very pretty.  The game breaks down very neatly into the box.

This is a strategy game with depth that requires planning.  It is worker placement and resource management. Just the kind of game I like.

A pretty basic worker-placement game with a few interesting twists. It's nice being able to build your own tableau with your own actions and bonuses and the upgraded workers are a nice touch.  

The area control part of the game just doesn't really work with 2 players. The dummy players don't really help as they feel very tacked-on and finicky. Probably better with more players, but for 2 players a definite pass.

RATING: 7.5
This is a solid worker placement game mixed in a somewhat unique way with area majority that works pretty well.  It feels a little lighter than most other popular worker placement games, and the artwork supports this feeling. The main reason I don't rate it any higher is that it feels a bit constrained and would not be all that replayable for hardcore gamers apart from the fact that 5 of the spots you can put your workers will be filled with one of 10 "guild" tiles, so the setup will be a little different each time.  The other slight drawback is that it takes a while to play - 2 hours or more with 5 players. But otherwise it is an enjoyable game, and I was very happy to have received it from a generous Secret Santa in 2012!

1st game was a 2p using the 2 robot players and I'd have to say that it felt much more natural and complex as an area influence game than Rialto, which we also played for the first time recently.

The fact that our first game went to 51 vs 49 is always a good sign I find. Really good game.

I look forward not just to plays with more players, but also plays with just the 2 of us as it looks a really tight game!

We played open card hands as we often do for the first game but it doesn't make that much difference as apart from the guilds and the hiring spot, placement denial isn't a massive issue!

There is nothing wrong with Belfort, but it doesn't excite much, either. Turn order considerations become quite interesting through the combination of area majorities and small-scale engine-building because going first is usually beneficial for one part and detrimental for the other. On the other hand, conflating the building options with the area placements means that neither is particularly compelling: you'll build some buildings because the provide nice bonuses, and you'll build others that remain unused throughout the game simply because you need the placements. That access to buildings you might want is actually fairly limited only serves to further muddy the waters.

Including different kinds of workers is another nice twist, but also looks like it could have been used for much better effect. As it is, the only difference between elves and dwarves is whether they will collect wood or stone as the "fallback option." There is no differentiation concerning the buildings or guilds. With little incentive for specialization and limited building options your engine will at least partly shape itself.

Auf der spielmechanischen Ebene ist BELFORT ein WP und Mehrheitenspiel. Auf der Ebene des inneren Kindes jedoch ist es ein kleiner, großer Zauber. Mit Elben, Zwergen und Gnome baut man allerhand Gebäuden in der eigenen Auslage, um sich so Plätze und Mehrheiten in der fünfwinkligen Stadt Belfort zu sichern. Das Spiel strahlt durch die gängigen, spieltechnischen Ritzen etwas Verspieltes, Kindliches und Liebevolles, dass es eine wahre Freude ist. Verschiedene Spielstrategien sucht man hier jedoch vergeblich.

Belfort is a solid worker placement game with good design and modular pieces to keep the game fresh. I certainly do like worker placement games, but Belfort is a bit middle-of-the-road for me.  I'm not sure if it does anything truly special for the genre when one considers the hot competition of WP games out there.  It all works, but it's a little too formulaic for my likes. I find turns take longer than they should and the game takes longer than it should and there isn't really that much interesting stuff to think about during your turn and certainly not much to think about when it isn't your turn.  I definitely appreciate the flexibility of being able to purchase buildings that work for you, but other than that I just didn't get excited over that much else. I should note that I do like the spirit of the game, both from the designer and illustrator. Overall, good but not a game I think I need to play again.

A really enjoyable game which combines multiple mechanics seamlessly to create a challenging and rewarding experience.  The worker placement aspect is slight, which is good as I don't generally like worker placement games thus far, the area control is challenging, especially with the point loss for ties, it can require careful consideration to find the optimal placement for yourself while still considering your opponents.  It doesn't seem to play as well with 2 as it becomes far less challenging overall - especially in the worker placement.

One of the new breed of bold and colourful euros. Includes area majority, worker placement plus resource engine mechanic. The order of resolving your worker actions is important as resources picked up along the way may be useful at a later stage of the turn. Resources and options are plentiful but as many actions which yield resources are open to all, this easy accessibility unfortunately reduces some of the tension that you would normamlly expect in a euro. Some luck in the buildings you draw from the pool. The rules are clear and the bits are colourful and good quality.

Ok but nothing new or innovative.

It's a well made worker placement game. It's pretty, has clear iconography and seems well balanced. My problem is that it's just another worker placement game. It doesn't do anything special and a lot of the decisions are obvious. Because the conceit is that you're not supposed to place all of your workers, there's so few spots on the board and some are more helpful than others at certain points of the game. "Oh, you took one of the 2 good spaces for me? I guess I'll take the other one. Then I'll place the rest of my workers to get the resources for this building and build it." - Every turn in Belfort. The gnomes are perhaps the one interesting quirk, but money is so tight that you probably won't get that many.

There's nothing wrong with the game, there's just not anything that excited me either.

A good game, but I feel ambivalent. I mostly dislike area domination and without this the other great mechanisms had given it a higher rating. Fortunately you can (and should) avoid the interactive guilds, which also turns the game into chaos. Decreased rating after a couple of more games.

Plays are too long and thinking can bog down as you try to figure out the optimum way to use your final workers. However, the game is beautiful; the combination of worker placement and area control is great; building your own combination of buildings is always fun; the guilds keep each game fresh. 

Strong Euro that suffers a bit from playtime and introductory complexity.

I need a few plays to see if my theory is correct, but basically I think that the game is overly bal-anced. It is part an efficiency game and part an area influence game. The area influence game is really basic, but the real problem I think is that it is symmetrical since every region on the board is the same. The economic part is also really balanced where I think with a few basic principles it should be easy to make decisions, especially if you play without the interactive guilds. And while I think the interactive guilds are needed, do you really want this kind of screwage in this kind of game? I am concerned about the game, but also interested and intrigued about it. As I said, I will need a few games to make my final judgment.

Belfort is a very good worker placement game.  I like how the points are score in this game.  The guilds available being different each game adds a lot of replay value.  The production of this game is one of the best that I have seen.  The rules, the boards, the player aid, the cards and ressources  (each with a different shape) are all great.
The only complain I have is that there is some downtime during the other players Action phase.

RATING: 6
A combination worker-placement and economic engine game with simultaneous role selection. If that sounds like an awkward conglomeration of mechanics, then I've described the game fairly well.

The game is set up with multiple "shops" in which players can place workers to gain goods or other benefits. Each player secretly chooses which shops they will place workers in, then the shops are resolved in order. Conflict arises when there are too many people vying for too few spaces. At the shops, there are a variety of actions that range from buying and selling goods, recruiting new workers, or recruiting specialists for victory points. Rinse and repeat.

There's nothing wrong with this game, but there isn't anything particularly engaging about it either.

I have no idea why this game got hyped when it came out and why it's rated this high. It works, it's fine, but just a mediocre worker placement game with nothing new to offer. It's actually somewhat boring, as you can't do that much in a turn. Good thing is the variability, but it won't save the game or make it a great one.

In short: There are much better WP games out there.

Molt bon joc de majories i de col·locació de treballadors. Totes les mecàniques encaixen molt bé (especialment el tema de construcció d'edificis, que proporcionen accions per col·locar treballadors, fitxes per les majories i ingresos) i resulta molt "sesudo". El fet de poder incloure diferents combinacions de "Guilds" fa que cada partida sigui diferent. Té mecanismes de compensació (impostos).

L'expansió afegeix uns quants Guilds més, selecció de rols, cartes "d'ampliació" per cada edifici, que inclouen més maneres de puntuar (per diners acumulats, per Gnomos, etc...). Els rols i els nous Guilds em semblen un gran encert, li donen moltes més opcions, mentres que la part d'ampliar els edificis no em convenç tant, ja que es fomenten estrategies que varien el funcionament normal del joc...

RATING: 7
After my first play, I liked it and wouldn't mind playing it again.  Lots of worker-placement dilemmas and conflicts, as usual for this type of game, although less than in a game like Caylus or Agricola, since each player has their own private buildings for some actions.

Because of all the decisions, it does seem to take a long time, however.  People are trying to figure out exactly how they can get enough resources to build their cards, which takes time to calculate.  It's even worse when the Bandit's Guild is in play, since someone could lose 2 resources or a metal, so everyone has to play defensively.

Every worker placement and action has an opportunity cost.  It may seem like a good idea to have more workers so you can produce more resources (and build more than one building per turn, such as walls, which take no cards or metal), and so you could challenge for the 3-point scoring for most workers.  However, it costs 2 gold and a worker to get a new worker, and those resources might be spent better elsewhere.  I've won the game with only 7 workers (one more than at the start), so it is possible to skimp on recruitment and still do well.

It's pretty important to get a good source of income to afford costs to use a guild, recruit new workers, purchase an extra resource when required, buy gnomes, and pay taxes in later rounds.  The Bank and the Market are both quite good for income production.

After gold, metal might be the next key resource.  Metal can be very difficult to produce, and is necessary for most buildings, especially good ones.  A Blacksmith allows you to produce metals very easily (for a worker and/or 1 gold).  

The Gatehouse is a pretty good deal -- two buildings in adjacent districts for 6 resources.  But don't forget the value of buying a guild for the same price, which gives you free use of that guild (or you can collect $1 each time someone else uses it).

It may seem like a good idea to go first in turn order (especially when your resources can be stolen by a Bandit), but it can be a good idea to go last in a scoring round, so you can maximize your district points.

Nice components, straightforward game play.

Worker placement, economy building, area majority game.

Elves, Dwarves and Gnomes...  The setting/theme does noting for me.

Catching up to the leader(s) may prove rather difficult...  Even with the most revenue (Gold) and workers, I finished last, even though I was building one building per turn...  Something does not work for me in this game, and I just can't put my finger on it at this time.  Will probably try it again at some point.

Combines worker placement, majorities, and many resources to shuffle around. As usual for me, I find the majority races and resource juggling interesting, and the worker placement less so. It is a beefy, anaysis heavy game, and seems well developed and executed. Great presentation. Still, I just don't dig worker placement enough to rate this higher.

RATING: 7
(08/2012) This is a pleasant, light, worker placement/area control game, that blends the most interesting aspects of any number of popular Euros:
1) Resource collection a la Agricola (but no accumulation)--go to a specific building or location to get resources or advantages; send more workers to get more stuff;
2) Buildings a la Le Havre, which are built per a schedule of specific resources--these can sometimes be visited by the player to get some rare resource or advantage;
3) Area control similar to El Capitan or El Grande--having the most buildings in each of the five city areas gets VP;
4) Recruiting more workers similar to Stone Age, but this requires gold instead of sending a "pair" of workers to the spot;
5) Turn order manipulation similar to Age of Empires III; 
6) Trading--selling or buying resources with gold; and
7) Punitive, linearly increasing taxation as players gain more VP, similar to Age of Steam.

On second thought, the worker placement aspect is very limited compared to other worker placement games. There are only a few places, i.e., "planks" where workers can be sent for special resources or services, such as recruiting a new worker or altering the next turn order. After those are filled up, a player may "pass" and then send the remaining workers to collect resources--wood, stone, metal, or gold. The more workers, the more stuff. Whomever sends the most workers to a particular resource spot will get a bonus resource of that type.

This is almost a "generic" Euro that integrates these familiar game mechanisms together smoothly, so quick, fluid play, almost conveying a similar generic-Euro feel like that of [i]Lords of Waterdeep[/i]. The theme doesn't feel pasted on, however, although it feels a touch cartoonish. Nevertheless, the artwork is full of lush colors, and the production values are top notch. Every little detail has been deliberately designed.

While I enjoyed my first play, it was a 3-player, so it felt more relaxed. I anticipate that it could get intense and feel crowded with a full complement of five players; four may be the sweet spot.

My only concern is that there may not be enough granularity in the VP schedule. It is 5/3/1 VP for first, second, and third place for having dominance in each of the five city areas, while it is 3/1 VP for having the most elves, dwarves, or gnomes. In my first game, it felt like everyone was making the same relative amount of VP in each of the three scoring rounds, such that we were only a few VP apart. The delta between the winner and second place can be traced back to a minor mistake during the second turn. Thus, the game feels very tight, and there are not very many avenues available to gain any significant advantage. It all boils down to simply building and gaining presence in the five city areas, and recruiting as many workers (in each of the three types) as possible--that's it. So, it feels very static. Perhaps several more plays are needed to reveal if the design has any meaningful dynamics. For now, it is a solid '7'.

An interesting area control game.  Your cards, and to some degree your mix of resources, place some restrictions on the areas for which you can vie for control.  There is a tax the winning players system that penalizes getting too much of a lead too early, but it seems quite weak in games with 5 players.  The worker placement element is fairly weak.  Mostly, it consists of picking the best of the shared (and powerful) buildings when you get your chance, and then placing all your other workers in private/uncontested spots.  There is also some element of investment/economy building, but there is little time for it to pay off and the opportunity cost is huge (the last scoring round provides no more points than the first 2).

I've seen a few attempts at area control games that take place in an urban setting and make it somewhat difficult to get pieces out on the board. This one is definitely better than some of the others that I've played (Skyline 3000 comes to mind). It has an engaging theme and a certain engine-building ethos with the cards, so that's fun. The game is longer than it should be, though, and there is some weirdness at the end when things begin to run out (the gnomes, in particular).  Taxes are pretty harsh, but an experienced player would plan for that. Second play flowed a little better and didn't seem as long.  (2 plays)

Great theme, great artwork, awesome mechanics for player actions.  This relatively obscure gem deftly combines worker placement with area majority.  The game lasts 7 rounds.  Belfort has much better player interaction than most worker placement games.  Belfort is relatively high on the AP scale (analysis paralysis) because the game presents players with a rich buffet of tasty actions to choose from--not simply what to do, but also which of the 5 regions shall I attempt to secure a majority in?  Everyone loved this game and I can't wait to play it again.  We played it with 5 players and it sang.  Probably not as much fun with 2 or 3 players.

Money, why are you so tight in this game?  Maybe I'm just managing you the wrong way.

I love the worker placement part where you can place it in town and get those workers back later but can still acquire resources at the mine, and quarry first.  

The 2 player variant is really nice.  You control one of the 2 dummy player color and the color you control can not only impact your opponent but can be used against you.  Thats brilliant.

This is a worker placement game for folks who hate worker placement.  The placement isn't suffocating and restricting - there are plenty of options, so you never feel hemmed in.  But still plenty of interesting decisions to be made.

Maybe 20 minutes too long for what it is.

Fantastic production value, too.  One of the nicest sets of components in my collection.

Edit: MUCH better once everybody's got a first play under their belt.  After everybody's got the structure and game flow down, they're able to look at the initial guild set-up and realize "hey, there's going to be a real money shortage in this game", and there's a rush for income locations; or maybe it's "ack! no metal", and everyone's snapping each other's hands off for blacksmiths and pubs, etc.  It's an 8 if you're not playing with new players, both for this reason and the shorter game time.

Belfort was one of BGG´s highest rated games that I still haven’t played. I was expecting an ok game but I found a good one instead.

Belfort is a mix of area control with worker placement and it works really well.

The game´s components are good and I really like the art!, however a friend of mine almost didn’t play the game because he really disliked the cover art, he thought it was a boring game (now he wants to buy it :D). I hate stickers in my games, fortunately my SO helps me with this task. When the board is crowed it looks gorgeous. The player aids are great and the graphic design works perfectly.

The rules aren’t very complex. You can explain them under 15 minutes. Playtime is around 2 hours with 4 players.

Best with 4 players.

I like the theme.

Belfort decisions aren’t obvious, in fact it is just the opposite, they are very interesting (in which district to build, which building should I build?, how many resources and of each kind should I get?, should I claim a guild?, How many workers should I get and from which race?, Should I upgrade my workers?). You have 3 different kind of workers with different capabilities and they also count for majority in the scoring phases. To summarize, Belfort has meaty and meaningful decisions.

There is some luck with the cards, but I feel it is controllable. You can always build walls without any cards so you can still fight for majority in the event no card works for you. Still I wish there was a little less luck in this regard. 

I´m also not sure how I feel about the taxes, they punish you if you do very well. In our game I did very well at the beginning, so the taxes bogged me down in later turns and I did nothing at all in the last turn. At this point I kind of like them, you need to take them into account when you plan your moves, but perhaps they are too harsh? I’m still undecided.

I played the basic game only, but after reading all the guilds I realized the game has a very high replay factor (a huge plus in my book). Also the guilds work for any kind of player. In the basic game player interaction was restricted to blocking spaces, but with other guild, I saw you can steal from your opponents. In general I dislike that option in control area games, but I love that there the option is available. 

Bottom line, I really liked Belfort, it has very interesting decisions. It´s sad it took me years to buy and play the game, It was very expensive and I could have bought it a lot cheaper years ago. I don’t remember why I didn’t buy it. The innovation in the game comes from the way the meshed the known mechanisms and from the 3 kind of workers. I already bought the promo guilds and I need to buy The Expansion Expansion. I´m pretty sure my SO will like the game as well and I cannot wait to play it again. Belfort is a keeper for me.

One of 2011`s favorites.

Nice merger of a worker placement game with an area control game. Not many games out there combing both elements well.  The expansion which adds special workers for hire with unique powers and building expansions bring the game up a notch. Tax catch up mechanic seems unduly punitive to successful players.

A decent worker placement combined with area majority.  I appreciate that there is no 'take that' element, which is not the norm with area majority games.  Unfortunately, the worker placement aspect seemed too limited.  The 5 spaces on the board almost always fill first indicating how powerful they are.  Cash was tight, which is always good.  Overall, I enjoyed my play, but decided to just play my buddies' copy rather than own it myself.

When compared to other worker placement and area control games, Belfort, while beautifully illustrated falls way short of the mark. 80% of choices made, make no difference to the end game. Its a purely area/worker majority game with the illusion of worker placement, and unfortunately, this game plays the same same, almost every time.

This is a fun area control/worker placement game (more the former than the latter). The theme is cute and funny, the building cards and guilds provide some nice variety, and the two player variant adds some great additional strategic elements. The stickers are a pain, but if you do them all at once you'll get into t rhythm and be done in no time.

Belfort has an enjoyable blend of mechanics and decisions. Interesting use of a worker placement framework to establish area control through the construction of buildings. Gameplay is smooth and easy to learn. Very attractive board and high-quality components. Lots of fun and I certainly recommend this, but it lacks dynamic interaction and runs slightly long for what it is. Also, I'm not sure about repeat playability given that the only elements that change are the guilds and card draw.

Despite the candy-coated fantasy setting, this is a meaty game that had me frequently doing intense calculations a la Power Grid.  Mix of worker placement and area control.  Lots of tough decisions to make, tough decisions whose angst are maximized by a well-balanced and developed design including different categories of workers, workers that are upgradable into "super-workers," and buildings that have different perks and different, limited distribution in the city.  The guilds keep the game fresh and different every time.  The production is very nicely done with awesome art of the buildings etc.

Hah, I see what you've done there! Somebody must have rightly guessed what it is I don't like in Eurogames, put all of it together in a single game, convinced Tasty Minstrel and consecutively Pegasus Spiele that it's worth it to publish this game with the single purpose of annoying me and then he phoned certain players to make sure they are with me in my one and only game of Belfort. Thank you all for cooperating!
The only thing that's beyond my understanding is how such a game - a game that drags along as hell, is inferior in depth to the majority of usually already shallow worker placement games, adds a one-dimensional strategic imperative of engine building, puts a highly subjective popularity contest disguised as majority scoring at its point-scoring core - can gain such an avid following and good ratings.
Yes, this is the rant of a sore loser, buth rightly so after two+ hours of suffering! Go down there, Belfort, in the corner where Die Händler is waiting for you. I even would engage with Lords of Waterdeep once more before I ever take a look at you again.

I suppose that the game works, but it offers no compelling reason to play it rather than the many other worker placement games. The strategy isn't any more interesting and the play time is too long. I won our first game quite easily and never had any long term strategy which is a bad sign in a game like this. I must admit that I had a prior bias against the game due to it being published by Tasty Minstrel Games.

A very dry Euro whose beautiful art belies how slow and AP-prone it is. I was disappointed with how vanilla-bland it was. Just place your workers, collect cubes and place markers to gain majority.

There's no theme, nothing special, this is about as Euro-cubish as you can get.

This game is excellent. Art is great, play is really interesting; simple to learn, complex to decide how to go... it looked like I was losing but I was second by only two points in the end... there are a lot of balancing elements IF you play a balanced game, or you can go for broke with a specialization or two... might or might not work out. Lots of replay here! 

My ONLY complaint is the gnomes; you have to sticker all the pieces yourself, and instead of being perfectly-even five-sided shapes, they have a shape that has a bottom edge and taller sides... which is hard to distinguish without rotating them around and around. Times twenty-some pieces, even the most OCD among us will start to feel a little insane. I actually talked to myself doing the last few because I felt so silly rotating them to find the bottom edge. A dot on the top, or pre-stickering at least the gnomes, would have REALLY helped.

A promising thematic and different mechanisms function well together. Very prone to analysis paralysis which makes the game take longer than it should. But the taxation system and two majority categories are still able to keep it interesting till the end. User interface and components are also top notch. District system and the trickiness of the turn order mechanism remind me of Ys. I wouldn't be interested in trying with the take that cards.

Based on 1 play.  Another entry into the worker placement genre, and without much to distinguish itself.  In particular, the buildings are a bit of a let-down.  I kept hoping for some interesting powers and the prospect of divergent strategies, but in the end the majority of them just saved you a buck or two a turn.

It's more a resource management than worker placement or area control. The inicial hand of cards matter a lot, because buildings are slight unbalanced. The Interaction Guilds ruins the optimization process. Despite those problems, it is a good game.

After unboxing my initial impression is that its bright and colourful. Looks inviting to play. I really want this to be good.

This game has a lot going for it.  It has things I like, including worker placement and area majority.  The major problem is that there is too much downtime between turns.  There are only seven rounds, but this game can take forever.  I won't ever play with 5 players and probably never 4 either.  If the game was actually 90 minutes from setup to teardown, I'd rate it much higher.  As it is, I don't think I really want to play again.

A game that incorporates a number of really good mechanics but doesn't do a lot that's new. It has fantastic components and it all works together really well. Starts off quite slow as you've got nowhere to put workers but a couple of guilds, maybe an extra worker. But as people target new buildings to get new abilities and put together combinations.

The guilds change a lot of things, and while I think I'm perhaps romanticising the game thinking it's better than it is, it's still very solid.

I pre-ordered this game and had a chance to play it at Stratigicon on September 3rd this year. I loved it and just barely came in second to a friend in a 5 player game. I was worried that the second phase of each round was going to take too long since each player did all their actions at once, buying buildings, etc, but it really went quick since you never have enough currency and materials to build more then a few buildings, and then I only saw multiple buildings going up per person on a turn near the end of the game. With 5 players the game took 2.5 hours with about 20 min of rules. It was also nice having Seth Jaffee there to teach the game and keep the players on track with turns. The way turn order changes mid-round is a very nice touch and gave a different turn order strat then I have seen before.

Moves a little slow to hold up just on the area control alone. The worker placement is good not the best. All in all a decent but not great game. I think the game can get real samey feeling. I just try to build something every turn so I pick the card, gather the resources, build it, and do the same thing the next turn. Only problem is a turn takes forever and you're just waiting around with no decisions most of the time. The only nuance to the strategy is deciding when to switch from building cards with income to spamming area control as much as possible.
The only interesting decisions (assuming you're just trying to build a card every turn) are when you're playing your houses, and thats so few and far between it can't justify how unnecessarily long and slow this game is.

There is a lot to like here for the right kind of player. Production is top notch and there is a good depth of strategy.

Belfort is a worker placement game with area majority scoring in each district as well as for each type of worker. Buildings give you influence in the districts as well as income, but taxes increase based on your score so the winning players will have to pay more than those behind! Manage your resources and gold well, choose your buildings wisely, and help build the city of Belfort!

I wanted to try this game ever since it was published. It looked like a complex Euro game with some fun thematic layer added. It turns out it’s simply a complex Euro with just as much (or little) theme as in most Eurogames. It’s a worker placement game, Caylus-style, mostly having the same elements as Caylus in different doses – for example, area majority is more important this time, owning action buildings is less important, also there is a spatial aspect so tiny that I wouldn’t even call it a spatial aspect; there are two kinds of workers used (they could as well be women and men like in other games) and gaining resources is just as simple as in Stone Age but less silly. It’s actually a fine (albeit a bit too long) game, nothing wrong with it, but it doesn’t provide anything really interesting or novel either.

Played once, 5p.  Very disappointing.  A well made worker placement, area majority game, with a fatal mechanic flaw for me.  I hate Hate HATE the "thief" mechanic.  It can ruin a players game if they're hit too often.  And it is a totally unnecessary addition, since it is a function of a building that may not be in each game (there are a couple of buildings that have a similar effect).  This would be a 7 to 8 without this mechanic, but, with it, it falls to a 3 (i.e. average to 5).  I really do not intend on playing this game again for this reason alone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The design on this is somewhat naive and balance could be better.  Starting turn order can make/break the game depending on guilds.  Getting certain building in your initial draw can also have far reaching impacts on the game (inn, tower, etc.)  The tax rubber banding might be a bit too stiff and is fickle (11vps instead of 10 means 1 less gold every turn, but 9 is same a 10, and 6).  We had a game drag for 3h, which is way longer than it should be given the nature of the stakes.  Also means a lot of idle time waiting for other players.  To me, the game feels like it's not serious enough for hardcore play, but too complex and involved for casual play.

On the upside, random guilds means re-playability, the theme is ok, the art is cute and the board is interesting.  There are certainly worse games around, but all in all it's pretty 'meh'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In the same amount of time taken to play Belfort, I would prefer to play Agricola.  Three different worker types (elves, dwarves, gnomes) made game play a little bit different for worker placement as each work differently, particularly gnomes.  Not sure if I really liked how the game used construction of special action buildings to allow for placement of houses to claim area majorities which was the main focus of scoring.  Didn't much care for luck of the draw in the contracts either which allowed others to draw the double placement buildings which I never picked up once, even when I went to the library twice in the game.  Argh!

Caylus is still my fav, BUT this one is also very interesting and has some really beautiful components. Also you can set it to be more competitive thanks to different combinations of Guilds, and the area control part of it makes it strategically different from Caylus.

The downside of Belfort taking too long to set-up (although is nothing like Arkham Horror), is absolutely overcompensated by the beauty of the board(s) + tokens.

A worker placement game that has a good design.  You are placing workers to gather resources and build buildings.  You can specialize in certain building types.  You are building a pentagonal city and it has a light fantasy theme.  The game has a solid design and is representative of the worker placement genre; but I found it dry.  It has a good catchup mechanism with taxes on the leaders, but overall there are better worker placement games out there.

Caylus like worker placement game with majority scoring. Use own buildings. Nice graphics but longer playing time (over 120 mins). Interactive cards are quite damaging. Different scoring strategies.

This is a fantastic euro. Nothing new, but they take worker placement, resource collection, and area control mechanics to create a very thematic and well designed game. I love this game. Lots of strategy and a very easy game to teach.

Won in a raffle at AnCon 2013!  Very flavorful worker placement game, the instruction book is a pleasure to read just by itself.  I was very blessed to just get this game for free.

It really seems like a Beginner's Guide to Worker Placement game, there's a bit of player interaction with competing for spaces, and for the right to be first player so they can get the places they want.  Other than that, you really just try to get an engine going so you're able to build the appropriate buildings in the city sectors so you can control them.

I like the game, I LOVE the flavor, and LOVE the art, but it really doesn't go very deep.  Well, getting the Big Expansion Expansion would probably solve this, giving each player assistants (like Occupations in Agricola) only available to them.  Agricola just has much more variety, and variable strategies, and that's just in the base game, where there's a bunch of expansions.

Traded for Agricola with a guy at CABS.

My family has really enjoyed this game so far.  We love the mixture of worker placement and area control.  The entire game feels like you are constantly struggling for resources but that's a positive.  If the resources were easier to accumulate then the game would feel entirely to easy.  There is a lot of luck involved with this game when it comes to which cards you draw.  Everyone hopes for a gatehouse or stronghold in order to get the most pieces into the districts.

If you've ever wanted to combine elves, dwarves, and gnomes into an area control game, then this is the game for you.  It's really fun if you are playing with literate people who have the ability to strategize and think logically.  

It's basically worker placement, economy building, and resource management that leads to area control for scoring.  You have to build an engine (workforce), so that you can purchase buildings to score.  The pentagon-shaped board is cool as well as the light player interaction.  I wouldn't turn down an offer to play this game.  I even bought a promo pack for it though I haven't used it yet.

Very good worker placement and area control game! This game feels very tight as you are always very short of resources and cannot do everything you want to. You always have to choose the right moment to build while keeping an eye on the tax collector, and the tax is a brilliant mechanism to balance the game.

I went to the table with high expectations on this one, and it is indeed a great game.

RATING: 8.3
I really enjoyed this game, and I debated a long time whether or not to keep it. In the end, I traded it for one simple reason--it didn't work well for us at two players.

At two players, you have to use two dummy players who build buildings on the board and compete with the players for area control. To make the game work well, you have to be aggressive and cut-throat with your placement of the dummy players. You have to place them where they're most likely to hurt your opponent. Otherwise, there's no point in using them at all because they don't emulate a multi-player game.

We don't like to play that way. As great as the game is, it isn't good for two without the dummy players (because of the area control element) and becomes too aggressive for us with them.

But this might be one of the games I was saddest to part with.

May 2013: Initial rating as a 2 player--8. To be sure, part of this high rating is due to its excellent component quality.

RATING: 6.5
A bit of a "Been There Done That" sort of worker placement game.  Make an engine, try to get it running, cuss when your area majority goals are thwarted by others just trying to do what they can.

I'm not a big fan of games that force other players to play in ways that make sense for them yet can't help but hinder other players as an inadvertent side-effect.  I felt that several times during my one play as players were forced to build buildings in some districts because it was the only one left to build the building they drew from the deck yet it messed up the balance of power in the district.  I'm not a "everybody has to play friendly" kind of gamer but I don't like being forced into this kind of play.

Thoughts after 2 plays:

What I like:
- Being last in the turn order is not necessarily bad.  You may not get the guild action you want, but you can react to the district majorities after everyone else has gone for that round.
- You need to pay attention to the areas your opponents have majorities in
- You can only add buildings based on the cards you have, so it mitigates the constant back-and-forth that is common in other area control games
- 2 player variant is not super fiddly and adds some more strategy to the game
- Taxes help slow down the leaders
- Good variety of buildings and guilds
- The player board is good at summarizing the gameflow, and the game is not too hard to teach
- Money and resources are tight. I never felt like I had a surplus of any resource.

What I don't like:
- Lots of downtime between turns, especially with more players
- Lots of AP in this game, deciding which building to build, in which district, how to allocate your workers to obtain the correct resources, managing your money, watching what all your opponents are doing, etc.
- It may be hard to get an engine going depending on which building cards you draw (that is probably due to inexperience).  I guess, for beginners, it's hard to see the strategy for some of the buildings.

RATING: 6
The most gorgeous pasted on theme ever.

A very well designed "spreadsheet" game.  I do not dislike the game.  Having played it once, I probably wouldn't play it again tho.

I solved the spreadsheet better than the rest, I won.

If you have not already played 20 euro spreadsheet games you'll probably rate it higher.  This is like watching a movie which you've seen many variations of already.  It's a great movie of its kind - all the young folks love it because it's their first film of it's kind they've seen (or maybe the 5th one).  

The game is reasonably elegant.  We finished it with 5 people in under 2 hours.  The game before us had one AP'er and took a little over 3 hours.  I think the last turn took 30 minutes.

I really like this game. The combination of resource management with area control along with a hybrid worker placement (resource gathering is the "pass" action and has no constraints) is very interesting. I'm not going to rate it just yet as I only have two (disastrous) plays, but it's shaping up for an 8. Put it this way: I Kickstartered the Expansion on the strength of two plays!

Interesting area control game in which players are competing to build sections of a fantasy town - Belfort. Players must collect resources, maximize workers, and pace their work (being too successful forces you to be penalized in the way of taxes...causing players to avoid running away with the game).

As far as the quality of the game, Belfort deserves a higher rating than I'm giving it, but I just don't find myself very entertained while playing.  My complaints are similar to those for A Castle for All Seasons: you work so hard to collect resources, acquire workers, and build buildings, but in the end, the scoring comes down to simple area control and worker majority.  It seems like a lot of work for very little payoff.  It's nice to have more intense player interaction in a worker placement game, but I worry about kingmaking, especially with players of different abilities.  All in all, a very well made game that just doesn't quite satisfy me as much as I feel it should.

This is an interesting worker placement/area control game. I played this having only really skimmed through the rules and seen a runthrough video of it, so made some mistakes. Also played it as a two-player game the first time, even though it's not recommended. I intend to try it out with another player count to see how that differs. The two-player variant works, but I would be more interested in playing without the dummy players.

A competitive mish-mash of worker placement and area control. Has a good map and a lot of buildings you can place into to gain powers. Additionally players can build onto those special buildings, owning them, which allows them to score in that district (area control) but also tax others when they place on your buildings (to gain powers).

Being completely honest, the low rating is more because this just isn't my kind of game. It's yet another worker placement game with resource management and area control, which means really it's just a spreadsheet puzzle, played in tandem without any zero sum conflict (and no - being able to steal coins or move other player's cubes is NOT conflict - if I could play a solo game with a randomizer that does the same effects to me than it's STILL indirect interaction.) Why would I compete to have the most workers in my district when it would be easier to send elves and dwarves over to your district to kill your workers, burn down your blacksmith and tower, and just win? So again, not my kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Played it once.  Realized quickly that the first player has all the advantages to the extent that it unbalances the game - fair enough, right?  All you have to do is become first player.  Except in this game if you're lucky enough to be the first player you can hold on to it indefinitely by taking a single action.  Therefore the game is a total waste of time.

It's hard to think of another game where there is so much stuff going on for so little relative difference in player positions in the actual scoring / winning portion of the game. 

There are innumerable problems with the base game scoring system, to the extent that I'm not sure "playing well" in the remaining portion of the game has anything to do with winning.

The tie-breaking rules are particularly troublesome and lead to senseless kingmaking [and not the good sort of kingmaking which adds interesting Scylla vs. Charybdis tradeoffs either].

The expansion which adds the possibility for individualized scoring paths seems to me a near necessity to create any game interest. I hope it works out as well as it ought to.

I would play it again for a learning game as is, but I don't think I would personally choose to play it again without the expansion in a group of players who had played before.

This worker placement feels different than most with the nice blend of area control / majority. The components are outstanding. The rules are fairly simple and straight forward, but the game allows a significant amount of choices each turn. Fun from start to end.

Very much a "been here, done that" affair. If you've played any kind of worker placement out there, you've played Belfort. The components are really good, though the gameplay feels very uninspired. I thought it was fine, but it isn't one I'll seek out again. I'm really tired of these derivative Euros, and Belfort exemplifies that.

This feels like one of those where I'm trapped in a lose-lose situation in regards to player count. Fewer players make the game flow better but makes the board too open while more players result in unbearable downtime.

This is a fine game. The game is some sort of worker placement/area majority game with engine building, but not exceptionally well in all three regards. However, because it is not common to see these mechanics being combined, the play experience is still fresh. However, I would love to have more of a game as it seems a bit easy currently. Hopefully the expansion could open up more strategic choices.

In the city of Belfort are five districts. Players start with elves and dwarves which they place on the board to earn resources, money or more workers. Players then build to put cubes onto the districts to score points for majority of cubes. Players also score points for majority of dwarves, elves, and gnomes, which you recruit throughout the game. 

It's a decent fun game. There is some possibility of analysis paralysis near the end trying to get the goods to place the right cubes on the map. I've only played this once with 3 players, but I suspect with more players it might be a bit longish. Still, I think it has some potential and woudl like to play more.

Just a forgettable game. I wish I could say more but that's all there is. I know I liked it but I can't say why. It's just mediocure that way. It was solid but it didn't do anything that really grabbed my attention and it isn't a great production either. It's just thoroughly middle-of-the-road.

RATING: 6.5
What an amazingly charming game! I love the art and board, the illustrations and pieces, and I love the thematic sense in the gameplay and placements. I wish there were more guilds in the base game, and I wish the "interactive" guilds were more about postive interaction than negative like stealing, but overall, I like this game a lot.

A small quibble I have is that everyone takes their whole turn at once, so downtime can be a bit high, but if players play it for what it is and don't min-max every decision, this can go quickly enough. The two hour time is a bit unfortunate still though.

Very enjoyable game with the best board I've ever seen (as of May 2015).

Plays: 2+

Even with 3p, the action (step 4) takes too much downtime in my opinion so looking to trade this now. Ill probably try to get a better WP that isnt so meh with me and my friends and moves at a rapider pace. Also this is 30-40% not rec'd at 5p and not rec'd at 2p, so I would probably get Caverna over this for its 3/4p play and itd be close time wise but higher quality with Caverna imo. But overall, I think I may have jumped the gun getting this so soon being attracted by the board and bits when the gameplay is just okay.

Okay downtime is way too high and its unengaging during that, just like with Cuba. Looking to sell now. Also Im not sure but i suspect some buildings may be better starters than others

Solid game with a nice theme that makes it attractive for children and non-gamers.

The reason it doesn't score higher for me is that winning is more decided by calculation on small differences in points than by strategic decisions.

Worker placement game with great production values
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very enjoyable worker placement and area control game.  The art is amazing and right up my alley.  I got turned off by not only the length of time the game plays in, but also there always seemed to be quite a lot of downtime in between everyone's turn.  I enjoy that when you build a new building in an area for the area majority, you also get an interesting ability when unlocked.  No one seemed to use the more powerful elves or dwarves, so maybe they could be a more interesting choice by making them a tie-breaker when determining points for that race?

The game is clever and when we have time I would not turn it down, I just do not see a place for it in my collection.

A variation on the worker placement => area control game (El Grande, Lancaster, Louis XIV, etc., of which it is most similar to Lancaster) with resource collection and conversion thrown in; one that seems to get a lot of love. It has its twists, cute art, cute theme, and it's fun in the playing, but after a year of solid gaming, for me it's not one that stands out. Moderate, inescapable AP.

Textbook worker placement game with area majorities scoring.

You build buildings that provide a special ability and score the areas you have more buildings in.

RATING: 7
Heavy in the AP department, but the real problem is the utterly unimaginative scoring. 

Also, the Guild cards are really disappointing because a third of them are direct attacks against a specific player. These are probably included because there is no other way of hindering the other players. If you leave the attack cards out, there is not enough variation in the setup.

Fantastic work by Josh Cappel on the artwork and usability department, though.

RATING: 6
Another twist on the work placement game. Different types of workers allowing players to collect different resources - nice idea, but there is rarely much conflict in choosing whether to use Dwarves or Elves and it's more about the need for wood or stone. If the two worker types - and I'm not including Gnomes as they're not really workers - had more differences or abilities then it might be more interesting. As it stands it a solid worker placement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I appreciate the increased permanency of the area placements. I have often been a victim of colluding opponents, usually metagame-related, so there's not much in-game opportunity to influence, and so my tastes run to games where that opportunity is not so strongly present.

There's a very clear striation of building opportunities in terms of economic benefit and per-placement cost. Pubs and Gardens are great at the beginning - they actually have a net positive return when built in the first couple of turns - while Keeps and Gatehouses are best near the end. However, the multiple scoring phases muddies the waters significantly. An early Keep can reap benefits for three scoring phases, not just at the end. And because the cards and/or resources limit your options, you may have to compromise on what you build. 

In most worker placement games, going first is better. In most area majority games, going last is better. Because Belfort combines worker placement and area majority, players are more conflicted about turn order choice, and actions to decide turn order are much more interesting than they are in other games.

There is huge variability in the game environment. There are 12 choose 5 = 792 options for guild setup, and as the guilds are usually the best spots on the board, the setup has a huge effect on how the game progresses. From the resource-rich to the resource-poor and highly interactive to everything in-between. Because of this, all the calculations for building placement and turn order must be re-evaluated each game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Despite some confusion regarding phases and when certain things happen (multiple players were confused about placement vs collection vs action phases), this is a nice worker placement game, and less complicated than I had imagined. It's mainly about getting buildings on the board in strategic district majorities by collecting and playing cards by using resources collected by workers. Nice to look at, too.

[i]- The theme is awesome [i](a funny take on fantasy)[/i] and the artwork is beautiful and really supports the theme. I love all the Easter eggs found on the main board's artwork.
- Excellent blend of worker placement and area/majority control [i](it even extends to how many of the different workers you have)[/i], which are 2 of my favorite mechanisms in a game.
- The rules take a little time to get straight, but once you get them down the game flows smoothly. I ended up appreciating how the different phases were split up.
- I really appreciate how upgrades are used in this game, whether it is buying a gnome to unlock a building ability or turning one of your dwarves or elves into a "super" dwarf which will collect more resources for you [i](but still only counts for one when determining majorities)[/i].[/i]

Cute little worker placement game with fairytale creatures to do your bidding. I've only played this with the expansion so I'm not sure what elements are part of the base game and which ones are "extra." The stress and accounting of resources can be exciting/aggravating as the resource gathering part is seen as the "pass" or last move you take in a round. But, overall, Belfort was cute and satisfactory. I'd play it again but I'm not sure why I would.

This is a great worker placement area control game. I thoroughly enjoy this game because there are multiple avenues into how you approach controlling and building Belfort. The worker placement mechanic is used in harvesting resources and creates interaction between the players as they compete to get to the best guilds first or have the most workers in the collection fields. Scoring though revolves around the area control mechanic as players build buildings not only for the utility in placing workers and gather resources but to score and control the five districts of Belfort. The game is extremely well designed, the manual is clear and hilarious, and the components are of great quality.

RATING: 6
Two Euro genres which aren't my favourite - worker placement and area majority - are mashed together here so it was always going to be battling up hill to gain my affection. Add to that there can be some bad player downtime, which seems surprising given there's really not that many worker placements to be made each turn - one to the board maybe, one to one of your cards maybe, and the rest just get lumped in one go to generic resource collection spaces. But you need to fine tune exactly what resources you need to build the buildings you have in hand, and there's a few different strategies that may be available or closed down (eg more workers, less buildings now, more later). These sorts of decisions are decent (just hurry up!). It's the area majority that kills it for me. You might get an average of 1 dude out per turn, sometimes 2. These low numbers  means it's very easy for a player to tie you vs forcing a tie with someone else - it's very arbitrary. And you can never get those points back - there's no makeup. If you're in front at the first scoring, it means you already have a lead in an area or two, and as you have the same opportunities as the other players in the next scoring rounds to get the same number of dudes out, you should be able to maintain that advantage through the remainder of the game. It's the seeming methodical inevitability that rubs me the wrong way. The game is obviously constructed well for admirers of the genre, with lots of decisions and strategies to explore ... but not for me.

Wow! Worker placement, Area Management, and Variable Phase Order in a wonderful integration without being dry dry dry.  Fun!  Fresh!  Addicting!  Intuitive! The randomly picked guilds and the building cards make for a different play every game.  Is not and does not feel like a "solitaire multiplayer" game; opponents can jockey for hiring the limited amount of gnomes, for planks on the collection board, for using certain guilds before others can, for who will get the bonus resources, or for building properties for district majority points.  Any downtime between turns is forgivable and lessened once people know the game better.  Not a gateway game, but once you learn it, you got it, and it's worth it.  So much to do, BUT understanding the game, and being flexible with your plans can stop potential analysis paralysis.  Cool fun artwork by Josh Cappel!!

Some people feel it to be a light mix of Le Havre, Notre Dame, and Stone Age.

Some people feel it is anticlimactic, but I find it very climactic as people are scrambling at the end to maximize their majorities.

This is a great worker placement / area-control game. My wife and I really enjoy the two-player version. The "AI" is not too fiddly and adds for an extra bit of strategy. I think the end game can get a little bogged down in 5 player games but not horribly so.

After a few tries: 
Usually area control games doesn't agree with me, but this is a controlled area control, where worker placement and resource handling is more important so it works for me. This is the kind of game I like, but it may be a bit too long. I usually don't have problem with downtime (because I meddle too much in the other players actions) but this is a game where I don't have to think too much but others do, so it becomes tedious when I spend 1/4 of the time others do.  

Have only played it with parts of the expansion expansion.

Another worker placement game with area control mixed in but a little lighter then most. The last few turns do not get really long as there are not that many actions to perform. You build locations with resources that you get from elf's and dwarf's and you want to have the majority in each district and in number of workers. Very nice look and good for those you like worker placement and area majority but do not want a very heavy game.

Yes, it's an area control game, but it plays more like a resource collection game.  Here, you're using actions to create buildings that usually give you additional ways to get resources.  There are a few types of resources, and a few types of action "workers", leading to a pretty rich resource system.  The game features a punish-the-leader mechanic (taxes) that really forces players to focus on income generation.  The area control bit kind of happens at the end, and while thoughtful play is rewarded, it's hard to readily influence and mostly plays out as a result of better resource production.  Overall, this is a more involved game than I thought it would be, and I think I'd enjoy further play.

I normally don't like area control games. But this game includes several things I particularly enjoy, and it does them well: buildings with special abilities, engine-building, fantasy theme, worker placement, resource collection.

RATING: 8
Building, it's all the same really. First you gather your resources, then you build your property and get the advantage which will give you an advantage over everyone else! It's fun placing your workers in different places, shame you want them on the same place every turn! So in turn- place, collect and build, from that comes a area control game! For me this differentiated itself for me to be great, then I played Rialto. Not to review Rialto, however if your not looking for your straight up area control game that is my choice. Special mention to the theme and the winners speech at which we laughed- you are the winner and everyone cheers! A good game which as with any old building had better, mordern alternatives.

Didn't make the cut as it was time for an upgrade, after all 7 levels of the same isn't that inspiring!

A very smooth and interesting area control and resource management game. In this game you have two types of workers which specialize in collecting different types of resources, but also can be used to activate actions. You get a hand of buildings, which you spend the resources on. When you build, you get another action spot and or some income in dollars and you get to place a house in a matching icon spot on the board, which then counts towards area scoring. So many different mechanical elements so wonderfully and simply sewed together. The rules are also written in a fantastically clear fashion. The game has a lot of re-playability through the different buildings and different action spots randomly placed on the board at the start of the game.

Decent worker placement / area control game. There's nothing that really makes me want to play this game over any other worker placement though. I like the tableau building aspect, but I don't like how short the game is. It feels like it ends before I can get any significant engine or combos built up.

Didn't care for it, way too busy of a game, too long with too much down time, minimal interaction, and maximal calculations for optimization of resources.

Only got to play it one time and with a few complications (a player swapping in and out, and incorrect scoring) but it was pretty fun. I think with a few experienced players or a couple of games this could get into the 9 range. The playtime I think is what gets to other players and I. The medium-heavy level of this game also makes it hard to rate it any higher.

A simple game that tries to spice up the dreadfully boring mechanics with quirky cartoon art. I'm a bit biased, because I don't usually enjoy area control games, but there are exceptions.

Worker placement meets area control.  It can be a little mean spirited as often in a 3P game you have to decide which of the other two opponents you are going to 'hurt' by taking some control of their area of the city.  But that is the nature of area control.

But overall it's a fun game that is worth playing.

A well designed worker placement game with area majority scoring system (which sets this game apart from other worker placement games). There are specialized workers (dwarves and elves), but this is only limited to ressource generation. As you already start with 6 workers, the race for getting additional ones is not as tight as in some other worker placement games. Turn order in the last turn is very decisive (as the last one can react and snatch away on or the other majority). You could have bad luck with your initial draw of possible buildings, when there is no ressource or additional worker building.

Somehow this game did not catch me and I would choose other worker placement games over this when available for play. However, I am also not a big fan of area majority scoring.

A mixture of Le Havre and Stone Age, with area control to score points. Great theme, awesome artwork, great rulebook -- overall just put together well. The game is incredibly well balanced and the selection of guild helps add to replayability.

However, when the 2p game requires making moves for imaginary players....it really isn't a 2p game. This will only be played with 3+.

RATING: 7
É um jogo de Worker Placement que pontua como Area Control. Nele cada jogador está ajudando a construir um castelo dividido em 5 partes. Cada construção que você faz é uma casinha colocada no tabuleiro. Em 3 das 7 rodadas, cada parte do castelo é pontuada de acordo com quem tem mais casinhas.

Pontos positivos: é super intuitivo, fácil de entender de primeira, não teve muito delay pra olhar regra como de costume em primeiras partidas de jogos mais pesados. Além disso, o jogo é bem parelho, com final bem apertado.

Pontos negativos: downtime bem grande. na hora de resolver as ações, cada um faz todas as suas jogadas de uma vez só, e as possibilidades são sempre muitas. Outro problema é que só há uma forma de pontuar: com as maiorias no castelo. Com isso, a escolha que um jogador faz de onde construir afeta demais os outros, gerando um certo kingmaking.

O jogo mais parecido com o Belfort que já joguei é o Rokoko, que mistura um semi-worker placement com area control também. Acho Rokoko melhor, pois tem menos downtime e mais formas de fazer pontos. A vantagem do Belfort é ser muito mais intuitivo, enquanto que a primeira partida do Rokoko é uma luta contra as regras.

This is an extremely unique game. Where you play a group of city builders that are employing elves, Dwarves and Gnomes to build out the city of Belfort. The players are in constant battle over the  majority of buildings in different districts in the city of Belfort. This  game has many mechanics that are different than most games and has a really creative gameplay. This game is definitely a Euro Strategy game though, do not think that this is a traditional battle game, because it is not.  I really enjoy this game.

Pros: Unique Gameplay,  Gorgeous artwork, Constant player competition. Extremely well produced game. 

Cons: Some groups may not enjoy the theme. Strange play order during game play may confuse some people.

Preliminary rating after one play. I think this could end up being quite great. The time frame seems okay for the depth, and I liked the decisions. The card draw could be a factor, to lower this a bit, but I could also end up going the other way.

RATING: 7
I really only tried this game to "see what all the fuss was about." The amateur and cartoonish artwork didn't win me over, and neither did the theme.
 
I was surprised that, as worker placement games go, Belfort is a fine entry into the crowded genre. The area control element is really where this game shines. At first glance this game seems very derivative, and it's a hard sell in the over-crowded genre of worker placement, not to mention the slight fantasy theme is rather generic. Despite all that, if you can find room in your collection for one more worker placement game, I think Belfort would fit the bill.

A eurogame that I actually really enjoy?? The artwork and theme are probably the main reasons why. This game is gorgeous. The mechanics (worker placement, area majority), aren't new, but the addition of adding gnomes on cards to unlock special abilities is unlike anything I've seen in a euro, and it's just a ton of fun! It seems easier to grasp than most euros. There aren't a thousand things to concentrate on each turn. You just place workers to collect resources, then build things, then score. It's very simple, and like I said, beautiful. Possibly the nicest looking game I own.

Also the quality of the components is second-to-none.

EDIT: Raising rating from 8 to 9. I freaking love this game.

Workerplacement and area control are perfectly mixed together in this beautiful game. Pentagonal gameboard which looks so great and colorful. Also all the components are high class ... the bar of steel is even glimmering. Playing feels a bit like work in this game. The more interactive guilds are in play the better "Belfort" becomes I think. This game needs interaction and it gets it then.
By the way: I'm glad to own the English version of the game with the purple cover and not the ugly German version in which an embarrassing printing mistake can be found concerning allocation of victory points.

I hated this worker placement / engine-building game.  It's very fiddly, with phases where you go around reserving one action each (to be taken later, at different points in time) and phases where you take a bunch of actions all in a batch, double-sided worker tokens (but not all of them of double-sided, to make the components marginally cheaper) where the back side doubles some aspects of the worker but not all, an elf/dwarf distinction that only matters for resource collection and nowhere else, and cards like a bank that gives you one normal income at one point and one additional income at a different point in the turn, with no built-in way to track that you've done this once-per-turn action.  The cards don't have great contrast, the income is easy to miss, and the overall ergonomics and UX of the game are decidedly poor (which really makes me appreciate the masterpiece of usability that is Scythe and its well-thought-out components).  It's also AP-prone, but worst of all is that it feels like so little of this mess matters, because you ultimately only score points for area control of regions where your buildings are built, with a you-both-lose tie mechanic that, at least in a five-player game, made it feel like much of the time there was very little to do to actually improve your scoring position.

A solid, fun euro with an interesting take on the auction and area-control mechanisms. Irocially enough, the worker-placement mechanism feels to be one of the weaker elements of the game. The inclusion of random building cards seems a bit odd - I'm not sure what it adds, save randomness, to the game.

There's some originality in the implementation, which makes an otherwise ordinary game a lot better. The game dosen't really shine for me - but I'll play most of the time. 

It does lose points as the two-player game feels really tacked on, and adds a lot of book-keeping and 'just-cos' mechanisms to an otherwise solid, medium-weight euro.

A pretty good worker placement/area majority/tableau building game in which brain burning is offset by a hair too much randomness for my liking. It's really fun, especially with 3 people, when downtime doesn't hurt as much (you do all your actions on your turn rather than one at a time presenting you with a puzzler). It doesn't reach greatness or provide a truly unique experience however, so my first pick in this genre would always be Agricola. If you like games of its ilk however and would like a change from the most acclaimed titles, it's a very good pick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lovely production for this game where they've gone out of their way to think of all the details from the rulebook to the handy hints on the boards. Top notch.

The game plays fluidly with players growing a number of useful buildings in front of them over the course of the game. The double majorities of areas and dwarfs/elf/gnomes is a clever touch because players can be losing points in one area and make up for them in another.

Regarding the Guilds: I think it greatly improves the game to make sure the Recruiters' Guild and the Architects' Guild are among the guilds chosen. Extra workers and the uncertainty of property placement landing in your area without a card help to create a tight game. (Building Guilds and Walls without a card are nice, but I like just a little more... and at a discount too.)

I didn't see any of the run away leader issues I'd heard about. Competition was targeting leaders throughout and the interactive guilds were always a threat to any break away leader.  Taxation helps out here too.

Absolutely no issues regarding downtime either. Experienced gamers are always looking to plan moves ahead and that's usually easy to do here. Not sure I'd want to play it with five though - then I could see it dragging. I can see this game running in under 90 minutes with four experienced players.

Scoring and ongoing judging of who's leading in certain areas was also an absolute breeze. I was concerned it would be difficult to spot who was leading in certain areas, but no issues at all and scoring only took about a minute at most. A non issue with me. I'm beginning to think I've just played this with the right people.

It's a very solid worker placement game with area majority scoring. Nothing terribly new or amazing, but light enough to play with family, not too mean, not too much brain burning thinking required and a reasonably fun challenge. That said, it's a very crowded category in my collection. I think the quality of the production saves it from being sold off over others in the category.

RATING: N/A
I'll reserve from rating until I've had a few playthroughs, but my initial impression is overall positive. Though the character art looks like stuff my buddies and I drew in high school, the rest of the art and theme is actually quite well done - including some great flavor in the manual. The board layout is pretty clean and easy to read and all the player boards and cards go the extra mile to provide the information you need to know without having to constantly check the manual. The wooden pieces all require stickers to be manually stuck to them, so first-time setup is kind of a pain. I was missing a single piece when I first unboxed the game, but I have contacted the manufacturer and should be receiving a replacement soon.

This is my first game of its type (worker placement and area control), and I've heard that while it may not add anything new, Belfort at least does these things well. Looking forward to playing!

RATING: 6
Belfort is so close to being an excellent game, but falls a little short in key areas: 

Timing is awkward due to the way that the placement and action phases are separated. 

Money is incredibly tight to the point that it's difficult to do anything besides build cheap buildings that generate income. The different buildings should lead to strategic diversity, but in practice, the crushing weight of taxes and the imperative to build additional properties so that you will be able to score well in the scoring rounds precludes focusing on the slower to get going buildings. In addition, some of the buildings focus on giving you efficient action spaces, but using them takes workers away from competing for the resource bonuses for having the most workers getting a particular resource, and those worker placement spaces are not THAT much more efficient.

You have to pursue worker majorities because they give you both an action advantage and points. 

Turn order is incredibly important in lower player count games. While the first player has first pick of the best worker placement spots, getting to counter pick your opponent in the area majority part of the game, and getting first pick of assistant is far more valuable. You can spend a worker to change the turn order, but it gives you literally nothing else in return, so I always feel like it is a waste, even if it is an optimal play. I don't think that this is such a big issue at higher player count games, as all of the good publicly available spots may be taken before the last player gets to go, which would make going last have a much more significant downside.

Despite these flaws, Belfort is a fun game. There are a lot of good ideas that went into it. It's just that the execution could have been a little better.

decent area control game, worth playing a few times.  Seems to take too long for what it is.  The "interactive" guilds can be quite mean and there is already plenty of player interaction via the area control mechanic... many groups should probably avoid playing with these guilds.

The game also seems to require a lot of work to score just a few points.  El Grande is a much better example of area control and also feels like it takes less time than Belfort even though both games have similar play times.

RATING: 1
Only soloed it. Ehm, not my kind of game to say it politely. 

It's a [i]"yo dawg"[/i] kind of game with stuff upon stuff upon stuff. It's not just worker placement + area majority (like AoE III or Dominant Species),it's resource management worker placement + area majority. Or like somebody too a game like Pillars of the earth and put a map over it.  Too many steps needed between (tactical/strategic) idea and realisation for my taste. And on top of it it's [i]that kind[/i] of worker placement where you build action spaces only you can use. 

The idea is well developed. So called whimsical theme is pretty tangential, but okay, things work. (At least the gnomes aren't slaves or something of the like). 

The reason this is a 1.0 it's because the design idea was putting 2 games on top of one another and thinking that cramming more mechanisms in the box is a good thing. Uninspired and pedestrian.

A good tight worker placement game, but prone to analysis paralysis and a decent amount downtime so that kinda put a damper on it for me.

We played with 5 players, which seems a bit long. It seems like a complicated game at first glance but as we played we felt it come together. In spite of that each round really dragged. The combination of the variable turn order and the number of players made it easy for us to get distracted and not notice when our turn rolls around again. Might be better with 4 or even 3.

A nice worker placement with resources management and where make points and strategies with the majority... 
good idea of the resources with the added bonus, as well as taxes that increase during the game ...

Played in two and three players, and recommend to 2-4p ...

Personal opinions:
2 Players: Become more strategic, since there is semigestione of an additional player for player, and it becomes like a game in 4 simplified ... good rule of exchanging players with orders to turn ... the rating would be an 8

3 Players: More fun, every player thinks to himself, and with interactive guilds tries to stop the others, but even without it is still very funny ... (always strategic)

Ami rögtön eszembe jutott a Belforttal való játék után, hogy nem tudok igazán belekötni, nem tudom még a szabályát sem megfogni, mert nagyon részlet, nagyon jól kidolgozott, példákkal illusztrált. A játék munkáslehelyezős, területi többséggel kombinált kártyás játék. Azaz mindent belegyúrtak, ami manapság kedvenc a társasozók körében. Jól kitalált a nyersanyagszerzés megoldása. Amikor már nem akarunk a körünkben munkást az egyes helyekre lerakni, akkor kell a termelő területekre, ott pedig többséget elérve bónuszt kaphatunk, így jobb később oda menni, hogy esetlegesen jobban befolyásolhassuk hol alakítunk ki többséget. Tetszett, hogy ugyan vannak kártyák, de még épp kezelhető mennyiségben és változatban. A játék változatosságát a kártyák mellett a játék elején kiválasztott öt céhépület adja, amik mindig igen erősek és fontos helyek. Pontok a kerületekben szerzett többségért és munkásaink számának többségéért járnak. Semmi igazi újdonságot nem tud a Belfort felmutatni, de amit belegyúrtak az jól összerakott és jól is működik.

A cute, yet solid worker placement game. It was easy for the youngest player in the game (she was 8 years old) to grasp with a bit of help from her father and while it's not as complex as other worker placement games I have played, it's solid and enjoyable. The tax system is an interesting way of mitigating early runaway victories too.

A solid worker placement, resource management, and area control game with a quirky/fantasy theme.  Manages to scratch several Euro itches at once.  Kind of reminds me of Terra Mystica and Stone Age in some ways, and sits between the two in terms of complexity.

This was a solid worker placement game with resource collection and using those resources to build some buildings to get some actions. The area control aspect is interesting and makes for some interesting direction of what you're trying to do. It seemed a touch long, and I'd like a couple of more plays before really firming up this rating.

UPDATE: It's not bad, but it is pretty long and there are just other resource management/worker placement games that I'd rather play.

This is an area control/worker placement game.  I've played A LOT of worker placement games, I like the mechanic and think it makes for interesting gameplay so I'm perhaps a bit more scrupulous than most when it comes to those sorts of games.  This one was good though, the spaces you could put your workers on were interesting and balanced and I actually really liked the mechanic where after passing all your remaining workers could be distributed to "free-for-all" spaces to collect resources.  This end-of-turn mechanic made it so you never really had a wasted action, something that can happen in a lot of other worker placement games.

The area control element mostly took place by building structures from your own personal hand of cards.  This is no Agricola, mind you, but having a private hand of cards that increase the breadth of the game (these buildings not only grant you control of an area but also provide income, additional action spaces, and other benefits) is always good to add variety and interesting choices to a game.

Where I think this game fell short for me though is while the end-of-turn resource collection mechanic works well to eliminate wasted actions early in the game many actions can be completely wasted toward the end of the game.  At least this was the case with 4 players and I can only imagine it is worse with the max of 5 because they only give you one additional space throughout the whole game for another player who starts with 6 additional workers (and can potentially increase this to 14).

I suggested to my friend (and the game's owner who appears to be very fond of it) that to alleviate this issue the game should have other ways to score, such as being able to take an action to trade resources for points, or having the buildings inherently grant points themselves.  The way the game is designed you only score with area control and majority control of the 3 different types of workers and only during 3 different scoring rounds (of a 7 round game).  He saw that as a "car vs. truck argument", i.e. that it simply isn't that kind of game.

After thinking about it more I think I more clearly see where the issue arose.  With every other area control game I've played (you could probably most closely compare Belfort to Dominant Species since they are both worker placement/area control hybrids) the control of areas is constantly in flux.  You can move your influence, destroy your opponent's influence, etc.  In Belfort there is a specific number of available spaces in each area and once one of them is owned by a player it is locked as owned by that player until game end.  So by the final 2 turns of the game there could be no good options available to you either because you could not feasibly fight for control of an area, already have mathematically locked down an area, not have the appropriate buildings to build anywhere you need to, or have all the building spaces in an area where you need to build locked down.

That was my only major gripe with the game, although I do think it is a major problem when a third of the game can feel pointless.  Other than that it is well designed and fun with a charming theme and artwork.  It plays a little long for what it is but a good part of that could be more the people I play with than the game itself.

RATING: N/A
I don't like two obvious things in Belfort. One is the area control and the way it is implemented and the other, more important, is the fact that players don't grow enough in order to stop making the same actions from the beggining of the game until the end of it.
Plus, it seemed to me that it has a runaway leader problem no matter what, especially if playing with three players.
Buildings are a bit dull and not very well introduced in the game mechanics in my opinion. I would rather want a game that would leave me space to make other things different than getting money or resources because I have this or that building but instead all players seem to play the same way, building the same kinds of buildings because that's the way the game should be played. Only one play though so I'm not sure about this.

Based on one play, seems like a solid game with some novel twists on typical worker placement games.  Two things stood out too me that could be problematic in the long run.  The first was that the game was pretty long (although we did play 5 players and everyone but one person were first timeres).  For the length of this game I would just assume play Caylus or Agricola.  Another thing was that there just didn't seem to be many paths to victory.

I like the artwork and the light-hearted tone of the rules.  The game itself burns the brain a little, particularly during the last couple of turns.  It runs a little longer than I'd like, but it's still fun.  A strange combination of area-majority scoring with worker-placement.

This is a very good game, splendidly produced.There is a lot of competitiveness built in to a friendly-looking exterior; the availability of placement spaces buildings and pieces is nicely judged so that there are several ways other players can mess up your plans and force a rethink. This does add to playing time and for this reason we tend to play without the optional interactive guilds (thief, etc); it is already a little longer than is always convenient otherwise it might have scored even higher.

I really like the way this game combines area control and worker placement.  The theme doesn't hurt, either, and the guilds add a decent bit of replayability.

I like that this game combines worker placement and area control in a successful way. I didn't like that you could steal resources off each other, which screwed up my planning, but I was able to compensate for that pretty successfully. Stealing was done through a guild, and it was by chance that this particular guild was used in this game, so other plays will be different. Also the game was a bit on the long side, but still manageable in an evening.

Area control game with sound worker placement and engine building mechanics.

There can be some number crunching in the later rounds due to the elf, dwarf, gnome count

Quality components, beautiful game with fantastic art and lots of details on the board. I think this game has the best rulebook I have ever read. It was very clear and it was a pleasure to start playing.

I'm glad to say game itself is just as brilliant as its rulebook and art lead you to believe. Increasing tax levels for players who do well. Majority bonus even in worker placement. Many times the buildings you need are not the same buildings as you should be building to get district majorities for scoring. Decisions decisions. AP warning!

PS. Before your first game, make sure you have enough time and patience for all those elf, dwarf and gnome stickers or buy a used game. ;)

I kinda liked this one, but probably not enough to buy. Our five-player game seemed mostly driven by what cards people drew early, and any one action seemed about as good as any other, leaving little in the way of hard decisions or turn angst, which typically sets the tone for a good game. I think action selection and turn order may matter more with fewer players and would like to try it that way. Update: After a second playing, I think Belfort has settled into the "near miss" category for me. I like some of what is going on, but it feels a bit clunky and rough at the edges. Interesting but overlong and a little flawed.

So far, this game is very much what I love in a game.. use stuff to build stuff, which gives more stuff.  Also, the placement of the buildings and controlling of the zones does not feel abstract at all.  

Weve only played 2-player once, but ignored the dummy players as it complicated our first playthrough, so I'm sure the game will get tighter as the dummies are added.

Belfort is a relatively simple worker-placement game, with a heavy dose of area control. The difference between this and most other area-control games, is that in most area-control games, getting pieces into an area is an easy thing to do, almost like just a simple action. But in Belfort, it requires building a building, and there are a limited number of buildings that can be built into each of the regions. So there's quite a bit of work involved with every piece you place for your area-control efforts. It's different. And I'm not sure I love the extra work that goes into it. 

The resource-collection mechanism is also a bit twisted. Players play a mini game of influence in different locations for resources, getting bonuses for dedicating the most workers toward the different resource types.

It's a good game if you're a fan of the worker-placement genre and you want something that feels completely different. 

The artwork and component quality are top notch.

This game manages to be a medium weight Euro while somehow actually feeling "fun". It is a very light hearted game which manages to have some decent complexity for decision making which will keep you thinking through to the end. The game builds up well over time so that early decisions weigh into later options without being crippling. Runaway leaders are well contained with a "tax" mechanic and the game has a great sense of humor. This is one of my favorite purchases in 2012.

Classic worker-placement where you constantly wish you had more workers and more time.  Becomes a tense race against the clock to control the most districts and have the most of each race (worker type).  Simple enough, while it might not appeal to many non-gamers, it is not so complex that it might appeal to folks who only game casually.

First Impression:
A worker placement euro with area control and a fantasy theme. Talk about a hybrid!

The game is a euro at heart, and as a euro it works really well. There are important choices and decisions, tight resources to manage and on top of that your workers have much more character and variety than other worker placement games. The area control is also well implemented, as it discourages (not completely but still) kingmaking.

It's not a new generation game however. The fantasy theme really has little substance despite the serious effort to paste over the game. In addition, althouth the game is clearly working, I found it uninspiring. Maybe because I generally dislike the fantasy theme, and so it worked against this euro in this case.

Overall it seems like a solid game I'm not particularly interested in.

Finally the wait is over and the game is played. I got 1 game in with 2 other players. I think it will shine with 4 players and using more interactive guilds. Ewwwwww this game stands to be pretty nasty. I love the limited placement ability in each district but that one guild that lets you switch 2 placement pieces around, awesome. Can't wait to flesh this game out more. 

At it's heart this game is an area majority game and as with so many others out there this one just sucks with 2 players.

Recently got this and after a few plays I really can't get excited about it. There is a fair amount of down time even with a three player game and it feels like a lot comes down to luck on which buildings you draw and when. The components and artwork are fantastic and the blend of the worker placement and area control is one that works really well, but I just didn't feel I wanted to play again when we'd finished.

The options are too few in this one, you are a bit too restricted in choices to do anything really opportunistic I feel...

Having seen the components and having browsed through the rules, I almost bought a copy before playing it. After playing it for the first time Thursday night at GenCON 2011, I immediately bought a copy from the Tasty Minstrel booth the next morning. Sporting excellent components and art, this game takes the familiar mechanisms of area control, worker placement, and building of your own section of the town and elegantly wraps them up in a very cute theme. With as much as this game offers, it manages to succeed in a way that is surprisingly easy to learn and teach. The play time goes a bit longer than what seems right for a game of this depth.

RATING: 5
Belfort is much more about resource management than it is about worker placement. The buildings dealt to each player and which are available for purchase on a player's turn dictate much of the long-term strategy, and even then, the differences between strategies are subtle; everyone still has roughly the same resource needs.

The wooden components are good quality -- especially the ingots, which are sparkly-painted to represent shiny metal. The cardboard coins are decently thick, but they seem lacking next to the other resource bits. There are also a good number more guild buildings than are used in a game, which would make each play feel slightly different.

A really good game, but a bit too long for what it is. A friend suggested it was like playing Pillars of the Earth but every few rounds pausing for a game of Revolution! Fairly accurate. The taxation system is a nice catch-up mechanism. If I had no other worker placement games, I'd probably play this more, but as it is, I have others that scratch the same itch that are shorter. Shame, but there it is.

This game is mechanically sound and the balance seems generally fine, but it has a variety of other issues.

Belfort takes quite a while to play and goes at a fairly slow pace.  Much of the design causes this; in order to not stumble pretty heavily, you need to have the majority of both your current turn and next turn planned out in advance.  This is for a couple reasons, but especially caused by having 2 different kinds of workers.  Your elves & dwarves can both be placed on most action spaces for the same benefit, but they give you different resources - so it's vital to know which workers you can place elsewhere to ensure you still get the resources you'll need.

And, for that level of investment and analysis, I just don't feel the decisions are interesting or varied enough to be worth it.  You'll be dumping about 2/3rds of your workers on resources every turn.  Your building options also tend to feel lackluster; they're perfectly functional, but many of them (e.g. the Tower) are difficult to really gain any value from using their effects.

The area control aspect, likewise, works just fine, but I don't really understand why they treat ties the way they do.  It means that tying another player is only taking 2 points away from them rather than improving your own score, leading to a pretty awkward dynamic.  There's also a variety of player-targeted effects which you're supposed to play with (though don't have to), which feel a bit out of place in a long game that already has plenty of interaction through worker placement and area control.

Finally, I'm not a fan of the pacing.  This ties back to always planning 2 turns ahead - nothing you build will have any benefit until the next turn, and even then about half the buildings will require a high price of 3 gold to start using (and potentially another gold to use them) - when there's only 7 (or 6 with expansion) turns in total.  Your potential growth and engine are also slowed by the constant increase in taxes, which are determined by how many points you have.

So overall Belfort still remains enjoyable enough - it works just fine mechanically, and decisions are often difficult even if they're not as interesting as I'd like - but I don't see much reason I'd need to play it a 3rd time.

A solid game, but nothing spectacular. An interesting combination of Le Havre and Stone Age with an area majority mechanic for scoring.

I'm not sure there's enough game play for the length. In particular, there's not really a significant amount of "engine building" as the buildings don't have particularly synergistic effects.

RATING: 8
Worker placement / area control hybrid, with the twist of having two different kinds of workers. After the collection of resources with the workers, you can have a battle for majorities in the five city districts, along with majorities of workers. And building city districts gives you new abilities, so your choices expand as you go. Definitely a high interaction factor here, some of the buildings allow direct stealing etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very well laid out board, player mats, rulebook.  A worker placement/area control game with a twist of taxes being paid to prevent a run away leader.  The game seems to induce AP and second guessing.  If it can be played at a good pace I rate it a 8, but it loses a point due to dragging on.

Very high quality components from TMG.  Nice improvement.

Let's get the most important thing out of the way first: SET UP A MONEY ENGINE EARLY IN THIS GAME.  Without it, you're going to suffer.  I don't think the entire game hinges on having a nice cashflow from turn to turn, but it certainly doesn't hurt.  The game borrows a lot from Agricola, but it also has touches of El Grande (the area control aspect of the regions) and Age of Steam (the tax brackets as a means to keep leaders in check), and winds up being a pretty decent little game in the process.  The downtime is incredibly severe, especially in the end rounds, and there's really nothing you can do while you wait, save for getting up and jogging around the block, or baking a Key lime pie, since you're certainly going to have the time for either.  It's got some neat things going on, and feels very tight, so I definitely would like to play again.  I just wish it didn't take quite so long to play it.

At its heart, Belfort is a very simple worker placement game. Guys in the wood pit get you wood, guys in the rock pit get you rocks and guys in the gold pit get you gold. Use these resources to build buildings, which you can then put future workers into to trigger effects. It's been done a thousand times.

There is, of course, a wrinkle or two...and they make all the difference. For one thing, many aspects of the game have an area majority mechanic layered onto them. If you have the majority in a harvest space, you get extra resources. It's true of the buildings too. While you build new buildings to create new actions, you are also building them to claim majorities on the town map. This adds all sorts of decision space as you try to find a balance between immediate needs and long-term positioning. There is also a progressive tax, that forces you to pay more and more money, the better you do on the scoring track. While I'm sure this is just a catch-up mechanic, it doesn't feel like one, but rather just another accounting challenge that seems appropriate to the game.

It's meant to be simple, but don't be fooled...there is a pretty heavy game hiding in there.

Rating would be a fair bit higher if the game were shorter.

Ultimately, Belfort doesn't contain anything novel (worker placement and area control), and strategies seem to be scripted (you get an initial hand of cards and, for the most part, that dictates your short term strategy and longer term strategy).  Choices aren't that tight - other than the guilds and initially, the new worker spots, there isn't really any competition for worker spots.  (See Florenza for a game which seems to do a lot of this much better.)

Add to this the fact that the game is really too long, and you get a 5 rating.

if this had been the first worker placement i played, it could have been an 8.
But it is probably the 30th, so.... nothing new and exciting enough to make Belfort worth to be remembered or played again.
Different workers, gilds, a little twist on majority... yes, they are somehow new but the feeling is the usual take, cubes, change cubes, make buildings too often seen everywhere. 
The game itself works, the rythm is quite slow, the art and the components are nice.

Excellent artwork, but that's where it stops for me. The turn structure is wonky and confusing, and takes a while to get used to. This is more of an engine building game than a worker placement game, and it has a runaway leader problem. The only player count I would possibly recommend this with, is 4 players. With 3, there is not enough interaction on the city board, and 5 causes too much downtime.

A fantasy town has grown up around the Pentagon. Upgradable Elves and Dwarfs gather building resources used for the construction of our blueprints. The Gnomes handle the administration.

Rating would probably go up on a subsequent play, but I wanted to like this more than I actually did. The turn structure confused some of the players, and it felt like the VP possibilities were very limited.

I also felt the staggered turn structure and "interactive" tiles kind of led to some situations you couldn't avoid, like being robbed and having no way to really do any action for a couple of rounds.

There were some meaningful decisions later in the game, but it just seemed like the possibility space for the game was quite small.

I liked the building synergies that were possible as well as the overall component production of the game.

The goal is area control, and I think it is done in a fashion that is appealing and fun. The game, for all of the things going on, falls within an evening's after-dinner time frame (at least for 2 players).

This has been my enjoyable experience with Belfort so far.

Belfort appears to have a Win-More mechanic.  Whoever gets the most workers earlier on will earn more points for having the workers and also earn more points by being able to do more actions.  The fight for turn placement wastes an action and makes it undesirable, especially when the player with the most workers can easily take back 1st on the following turn without much detriment since he already has more workers than you.  This balances out a little with 5 players and is really quite enjoyable with a full 5 players. I do not recommend this game when playing with less than 4 players.

The area majority thing is nice, but it's also not exactly obvious and people generally don't pick up on that on their first play, from what little I've seen. Also, the turn order manipulation is a nice idea too, but again, it's not obvious and went largely ignored in my plays. 

Cute theme though.

Manages to mix a few genres pretty well. It really boils down to an area majority/worker placement game rather than an economic engine game for me. The buildings could use a little more life, they are pretty standard and don't have much incentive past generally a small bonus and the obvious building marker. 

I hope they release a small ~25 card expansion solely comprised of buildings. These would hypothetically be more complex or beneficial to spice the deck up, almost like mini-guilds. Give me more incentive to build other than placing a house.

Traded for Strasbourg. Outside of components, this game doesn't have enough going on for me.

A very thinky, meaty game, but still lots of fun.  As many have said, really more of an area control control game with a strong WP mechanic to drive it.  Great production and components.  Obviously well developed and tested, it has a great balance, offers good catch-up strategies, and often results in close games.  High tension, as you will not really be able to do everything you want to do, but multiple paths to victory.  Seems like you could play this a lot, and always try new strategies.

The drawback is that it's kind of fiddly with all the little bits floating around. It also takes long time to explain/teach.  And it has a fairly long play time, relatively.  Still it is worth it, a great game here.

One of the best euro type games i have ever played. I like it's theme and look. Also the rules are great, thay're simple but gives You many different options during play.

A fine enough game but other games do the same thing. A mix of worker placement and area control. Likely to be "jones theory"'d out of my collection soon

I've only had a chance to play this a few times. It's a shame that great games like this get overshadowed by the more popular titles like Lords of Waterdeep. While I find "Lords" to be fun, I prefer Belfort for its multiple gaming mechanics that combines multiple styles of play.

It's quite a good worker placement game. The limited number of gnomes, which super boost your buildings, could be a bit more limited to make this game even better.

7 after two plays.

Too much downtime due to too many workers. Income and tax seems redundant. District scoring and building cards tie in well. Dislike the guilds which allows stealing.

liked this one a lot, but it's definitely an area control game with worker placement mechanics, rather than the other way around...will have to get used to some weird timing issues that made my first play very sub-optimal, but I see what I need to do to get better even though I won!

It's too long and too balanced. We had all 4 players inside 2 points in the end of 4 hours game. I liked the idea, but is there replayability? Can give another chance with 3p or 5p.

We played it with 5 and rating of 5 might be too high. I wanted to like this, but something is badly missing here. Uninteresting.

Though if you like tight scoring games this might be 1 for you.

This is a well designed game and I liked it *a lot* the first time or two I played it.  But then the sessions started bogging down with the much discussed AP problems we avoided in the first games and I stopped enjoying Belfort as much when it started consistently taking 3 hours to play. Still a decent game, but not something that was going to stay in the regular rotation so I traded it away... then reacquired feeling as if I misremembered how much I liked the game... and found it was still not quite for me and traded away again.

Great game,  love the mechanics for the game.  Though, there is a bit of down time between your turns.  So if you are playing a full 5 players there could be periods of time where you're just sitting waiting.  So I would not recomend 5 players.

Belfort is another Euro style game. Worker-placement, resource management, area control, hand management,all off them typical mechanisms of a euro-game. Is this game a worthwhile addition to our game-collection?

Each player starts with 3 elves, 3 dwarfs, 5 gold, 1 wood, 1 stone and 1 ore. In a 2-player game, each player has limited control of one other color. Which color that is, depends on the turn-order.

The game takes 7 turns (months) to play. Each months the next steps has to be fulfilled:

    Move the calender marker to the next month.
    Placement of the workers. Players place one of their workers onto a available action-spot (planks), then the next player will place one worker, and so on. If a player passes, he has to place all of the workers that are left onto the resource-collecting areas.
    Collection. Player collects their resources. A player who has the majority in a particular area, gets one resource of that kind for free as a bonus. They also collect their generated income and pay taxes.
    Actions. Players collect their workers, and do the corresponding actions.
    In a 2-player game, the player with turn-order marker 1, takes an open card, and place a property-marker of the non-player color with turn-order 3 on the board, at the corresponding building. Then the player with turn-order marker 2, does the same with non-player 4. After that, the (placed in the set-up) workers of the non-player markers will move 1 spot clockwise to the next guild.
    In 3 of the 7 months, there will be a scoring. If there is a scoring in the month which is on turn, players collect their points. In a 2-player game, also the non-players collect points.

Possible placement of the workers and their corresponding actions in the game are several, like place a worker and pay 2 gold at the recruitment camp, to get a new elf or a dwarf. Place a worker at the king’s camp, to change turn-order. Place a worker and pay 1 gold on a guild, to get the benefits of the guild. When it comes to the action-phase, a player can also build a building (property card), build walls, build guilds, buy/sell resources (once per turn), hire a gnome (once per turn). When all actions are done, a player can, as a final action, build 1 property card.

The scoring part, is the part where the result of area controlling comes into the game. The player with the majority of owned buildings in the area (there are 5 areas), gets the most points. In a 2-player game, scoring is as it would be in a 4-player game. Next step in the scoring is determining who has the most workers of a kind. Players get points for having the most dwarf, elves and gnomes.

The thing that makes this game interesting is, the continuously struggle between worker placement and majority in an area. The worker-placement part, makes you want to have the first choice, so you’ll have to spend a worker to become first in the next turn. But, the majority part, wants you to have the last choice, so you can see where the other players built there buildings, and that way, you can built an extra property in a certain area to get some extra points. This struggle is what makes that the game is not just another euro. This struggle is what makes the game shine.

Not much new in this worker placement/resources/area control game, but it does it very well.  The gnomes and guilds add a nice touch.

I probably own too many WP games, but this is a medium-strategic game that people that aren't inclined into heavy ones like Agricola would probably be okay with.

Simple but brain-challenging pure area control game.  Humorous theme belies the play.  Definitely recommended for those seeking the genre.  Has some very minor worker placement elements, but all scoring is based on how well you control the city.

A solid worker placement/area control game with a quirky charm. Lovely components and a straight forward game make these nicely accessible. There's nothing especially out of the ordinary here bit everything just works.

Very nice party and reflex game. Plays very well with family and friends.

RATING: 7.5
Silly pointless fun.
Most games I've played so far have had laugh out loud moments, usually as someone has answered a question with the obviously wrong hand.
Good game to end the night on, or play while waiting for others to finish something.

With the right crowd, I can see this being a success. But one that is difficult to take seriously, especially with questions that may be ambiguous or only known to certain people.

Another great little quick Blue/Orange filler/party game. I'm terrible at it but it's too funny not to enjoy watching as you and others mess up with their reflexes. Good for nongamers

Really a great party game.  The idea of the game is so simple to explain that you can start playing immediately and the results are often hilarious.  The fact that the questions are so simple, yet produce confusion, is really what makes the game special.

The one downside is that the game is currently only for those that speak French.  I'm thinking about translating the cards so that we can play it more often, I hope someone is able to publish this in English.

The one big drawback to this game is the record keeping.  Especially when playing with the full complement of players, recording all the points in a really quick way can be a lot of work.  And you have to write it down fast, since any game where the accounting takes longer than the game play (definitely happens here) can test one's patience if it takes too long.

So glad that an English edition came out.  The changes they made were all for the better.  The cards are larger and easier to read, the target is a little higher quality, and most importantly, the scoring mechanism makes a lot more sense for a game of this weight.

It's even really fun to play this as a kid's game, though I think it is most fun with adults.

I could not pull the trigger in this game. I think I'm a little to old and slow for it.

RATING: 7.5
Quick, short party game, very simple, with laughs guaranteed. It's a little tedious to count points with many players though.

Great filler, you can play with any player count and for as many rounds as you want and still get a good experience.

Party game, where players answer simple yes/no questions by a small hitting a rubber target your left or right hand. Contextual questions, hesitations and confusion between right and left hands make for some good laughs.

decent party type game.
Amazing how hard it is to remember left hand means false when also parsing the somewhat confusing statements.

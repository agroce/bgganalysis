As Filou says, this one reminds of Abalone in the way things are pushed around.  While in Abalone the object is to push your opponent's pieces off, in Siam only one rock needs to be pushed off to win the game.  This and the small (5x5) board makes for a much quicker game.  Just as Abalone inspires sumo analogies, so Siam revolves around feints, blocks and the well timed application of force.  The board and pieces are lovely.  a shame that the packaging they come in is not.

Siam est un petit jeu abstrait, aux parties rapides excédeat rarement les 15 minutes.

Le plateau de jeu est un carré de 5 x 5 cases. Au milieu du plateau sont disposées trois montagnes.
Chaque joueur incarne un troupeau de rhinocéros ou d'éléphants.

Another abstract game that I have not yet known before Spiel Essen 2017. It does look like chess, but much more simplified and yet it still offers a very solid and delicate mechanic. Everything is balanced. Each side can win fairly through good movements. Whoever pushes the first stone wins, this condition sounds simple but the ruling makes it quite hard to achieve. Strategy and tactic are essential. High replayability (I know it is not a word, but well, let's use it in our community) and this game will not let you get bored. I can say that this game is my filler game and one can agree that you can use this game as an introduction to someone that's new to the world.

First thing first, the pieces in this game are really beautiful.  I was worried that the gameplay wouldn't live up to the pieces, and though that may be true, the game itself is also still quite good.  The rules aren't well explained though, and there's a bit of fiddliness on win conditions, but all in all, a good game experience.

Nice, compact and elegant game which reminds me of an arcade game from the 80's, the one with the penguin pushing ice blocks around.  I suspect this game has a learning phase where one must make all the possible mistakes before nailing down some workable strategies.  Beautiful components and engaging play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great abstract, reminiscent of Abalone but that seems to correct a lot of problems of this game. For one, Siam doesn't reward passivity as much as Abalone. The board is small and you need to act quickly in order to achieve your goal. There is a lot of read-ahead, a feature I enjoy in an abstract. Finally, the material is nothing less than somptuous, with finely crafted wood (or resin?) elephants and rhinos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Ferti edition makes for a beautiful game with solid resin pieces, but under the exterior is a neat little abstract too. A pushing game with hints of Abalone but a much, much better game. A bit funky to learn, but it all makes sense once started. Nothing as mind blowing as any game in the GIPF series, but this is a solid abstract game!

 What really brought me to the game where the wonderful resin pieces and didn't really care about the gameplay, although after a few plays it's quite interesting and fun to see the elephants and rhinocs pushing each other in an attempt to get the mountains off the board.
The replayability worries me a bit though, and I'm afraid there could be a winning strategy for the starting player.

This is a fun little abstract game.  I have not played it a lot to see if there is a deterministic aspect to it (as the first player has an advantage) but am becoming convinced that swapping sides and counting moves to a win could easily even that out.  

The game has definite look-ahead challenges to it.  The second player especially has to play defensively, and knock stones out of the way to put them in her line.  The pointing rule is very good at making these defenses effective. 

I have implemented this with IceHouse pieces on a Volcano board.  You could also do this with one TreeHouse set (3 large for stones, one player takes small, the other takes medium for animals).

Un juego con un arte espectacular. Las figuras que parecieran de madera en realidad son de cerámica, hay que tener bastante cuidado en especial con las orejas y cuernos de los rinocerontes, jugando la primera partida se me quebró uno de ellos. Se ambienta en una historia fantástica de una lucha por el territorio  entre Elefantes y Rinocerontes.

 Su mecánica es abstracta, por tanto requiere de ser táctico a la hora de colocar las fichas dentro del tablero así como a la hora del movimiento. Es un juego que me ha encantado y pienso   tener las tres versiones, ya que la versión "Travel" es juesta para llevar a cualquier parte, mientras que la versión "Deluxe" se vería estupenda como decoración sobre una mesa.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2012)

Siam is a lovely abstract game. I played the first large edition and the wooden pieces (perhaps they aren´t wood, I´m not 100% sure) are very well done and they look great on the table.

The rules are pretty easy to get, you can explain them under 3 minutes, but the game has a lot of depth. Playtime is under 20 minutes.

My desire to play the game isn’t very high, so I’m downgrading its rating, however, I still feel it is a good game to play from time to time. The decisions aren’t obvious and you need to plan several moves ahead.

Bottom line. I have enjoyed my Siam plays. I´m open to play it again and  will probably buy it. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 8
Seriously beautiful game. It is a game of push, where the object is to push one of three rocks off the board before your opponent can do the same. Facing, in addition to positioning, is important. You can only push, or resist a push, if your piece is facing the right way. The game is light, fun and plays quick. The nicely-weighted carved elephants and rhinos gives the game an immense tactile satisfaction.

Nice fast two player abstract strategy game. The goal of the game is to push one of the three rocks from the board. Abstract Sumo with vague similarities to Abalone. Beautiful components. Interesting game play. Even when everything looks practically hopeless, there is mostly still a move with a new twist on the balance of the powers on the board.

RATING: 7
An abstract played on a 5x5 grid, with 5 identical pieces per player (elephants vs. rhinos) and 3 neutral pieces (rocks). I thought something so simple couldn't possibly be an interesting game, until I found out that the direction each piece faces matters, which makes all the difference. In essence you're trying to shove one of the rocks off the board, but you can also shove each other. Great abstract game, unfortunately there doesn't seem to exist a single version of the rules that is actually clear.

This is what Abalone should have been like - short, compact, with lots of pushing, strong positional play... but sporting nice dynamics (without stalemates!), adding management of the own forces, twisting movements and a little asymmetry in the distribution of pieces on a 5x5 board. 

To sum up, Siam is a transparent, rewarding abstract of low difficulty and medium depth. Of course it can be played with standard materials, but as usual with Ferti games the finished product is simply beautiful.

 i don’t really like abstracts. but this one is fun. i like the “pushing” mechanic a great deal. and there is not so much look-ahead that the game feels oppressive - it remains simple and fun. a bit of a tug of war feel. and elephants. that is all.

[Rated 2006/03/15, based on 1 play]It wasn't really obvious what made any sense to do to start with.  Some more thought involved once some pieces were on the board and rocks were moving around, but still a bit confusing, to be honest.  I can see this being a grower - if played a lot, you could get a feel for it, but I'm not sure if I'd bother.  Very nice bits though.

It has RHINOS!  Rhinos are my favorite animal, so that right there gives me a big reason to like this game.  The game itself is a neat abstract strategy game with the very nice elephant, mountain and rhino pieces.  Simple to learn, but very hard to master.  Very fast and addicting game - played it 8 times the night I learned it.

RATING: 6
Interesting and lots of depth for such a small board, overproduced (you could play with coins and a sheet of paper) but nice bits nevertheless.  Several games yielded varied results, including one win by black (me.) My opponent was not so impressed, but he doesn't like games unless you can figure them out, or alter the rules to make the game favor his playing style. I like this game just as is, and hope to play it again. My guess is the game is solvable if there is enough interest to find the solution. Deluxe edition has the HUGE pieces.

A sign of a good abstract is that it confuses you to no end.  Siam achieves this.  The rules are fairly simple once you've muddled through the bad english translation, but 12 games later, I still have only the simplest grasp of the shifting tactics involved to play this well.  Extra points, too, for the silly theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
very nice! 
Although Siam won't win a prize for innovation (It's actually a revision of Kubas/Akibas mechanics), it optimises the gameplay in nearly every sense. Whatever I liked about Kuba remained untouched, while at the same time the elements that didn't work were removed mercilessly.

Just a few things that come to my mind after a couple of plays:
- no more silly double-movement rule, which advantaged the first player    way too much.
- more fexible starting positions
- less pieces on the board (this may sound like a disadvantage, but I      always found the board owercrowded with marbles, which often lead to     stagnation/limitation. Just take look at this picture:                   http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/47237
  Once several marbles are removed from the board, Akiba becomes a lot     more interesting. And thats were Diam begins)
- more options for a move (changing the direction, removing of pieces,     etc.)

There's just one thing I have to criticise: ambiguous/incomplete rules! Written in an very comprehensible (but rather informal and incomplete) style, everyone seems to understand them. Unfortunately, everyone seems to interpret them in a different way. Worst of all: The german, dutch and italian rules don't even mention the rule-variants!!!
Anyhow
Kuba is dead, long live Siam!

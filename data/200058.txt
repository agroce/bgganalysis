We didn't need another farming game, but this is a really good farming game.  I'll play anything from Trey (Argent is amazing, and so is this game).  The game has interesting decisions throughout, and offers replayability with the worker spots that randomly come out each round, along with the buildings.  Probably my surprise hit of 2017.  Don't let the small box fool you, this is a REALLY good worker placement game with an awful generic theme.

A bit on the random side, but over quickly enough and enjoyed it more the second time round, though fewer players may have helped - certainly shorter with three.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, light-medium weight tactical engine-building worker-placement game with a nice and funny theme, that for an unknown reason make me think of Viticulture (Worker-placement, variable turn order, planting and harvesting, building buildings on fields, etc.) even though it's definitely doesn't have the same feel at all.
++ I like the twist on the player order turn with the Initiative cards and the twist on the variable worker-placement spots that show up every round from the Action cards. This make the game really tactical where you must think on how to optimise your few actions carefully.
++ Good replayability from the fact that each game use just a part of all the action cards (just a third of the deck in a 2-player game), the 9 characters with variable power, and the variable card draw of the buildings (we only see a few per game out of a large deck) and the card draw of the initiative cards.
++ The component quality is great: Cards have a linen finish, cardboard tokens are thick, the player mats are of good quality (even though they are of the thin type, which doesn't matter to me to be honest, but I know it's something that could bother some) and the box feels sturdy.
++ Fun, really fast to set-up (using a Plano organizer for all the wooden and cardboard tokens) and really fast to play, all that in a small portable box.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- There is some graphical design choices that I don't understand and that doesn't help the learning of the game: 1) Why the snap peas are half silver and half gold, instead of just been gold? This sometimes make people think that they are worth just half a "dollar" to buy stuff, or that you can plant or tend 2 of them with just a single Manure or Water. 2) Why the actions on the board are not in the logical order? Plant to the left, then Tend in the middle, and finally Harvest on the right seems better. 3) Why two single-space crop are of white color? Scarrot and Phantom pepper are easy to confuse between the two, and scarrot could have easily been orange/yellow, which even though it would be similar to the Plumkins in color, the size would be different. 4) Why the seed side doesn't have a different background than the crop side? A brown field background is great for the planted crop side (as it look great in on the field cards), but the seed could have been any other color (light beige maybe?) to easily distinguish between the two sides at a glance.

Worker placement. Players place two workers over 5 rounds. They buy seedlings, plant, tend and harvest different crops, worth from 1 to 5 points. Higher rated crops are more costly in terms of fertilizer and water. Players can also extend their farm with new land and prepare this land to form new planting fields. Buildings can be bought and placed on one of the fields in order to bend the rules or obtain extra VP at the end of the game when certain conditions are met. Each round starts with players determining playing order by taking a card. This card immediately gives some favours (seeds, water, fertilizer or actions one can take without having to place a worker), with the smaller favours of course on cards giving players a higher chance of being the starting player in the next round. Each round a row of extra action cards is also placed, which provides extra spaces to place workers, next to the 7 spaces on the central gameboard.

RATING: 8
One play so far that I really enjoyed for the relative level of decisions to the rules and play time. The hook here is the pull between selecting your turn order (TO) card and the action cards on offer this turn. The TO card you select will, in addition to the obvious, provide you with resources and/or actions that you take immediately. 

Each turn new action cards come out that are (generally) more powerful than the basic ones on the board. They offer resources and/or actions and are situational to your game. 

So, you might choose a TO card to get first crack at them, but the lower ranked TO cards come with better benefits (resources as well as the actions to use them) than the higher ones. Makes for a an interesting decision each round. I found early in the game I preferred the later TO cards to get more free stuff and actions but later in the game, I desperately needed TO to secure a much needed action on offer. 

The actions allow you to “get there faster” which makes the game satisfying. You plant, tend, or harvest ALL your stuff with an action. No micro turns here.

Much better than Happy Pigs.  Some similar economies to that game.  This one has variable buildings, variable actions, and variable initiative bonuses.  All of that together seems like it will give this game some legs.  It certainly makes it feel more than one dimensional.  Surprisingly good.

RATING: 5.7
Pretty standard worker placement, resource conversion game with some design elements I find annoying. The game achieves a small footprint, but at the expense of functionality as the cards are small, hard to read, and the locations change every round. Plus, the game feels about one round too short for me. This is about a 20 minute teach for 45 minutes of gameplay, which is not a great ratio in my mind. Overall, a decent game, but one that I don't need to return to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Tense, variable powers, and can be banged out in 2p in less than 20 minutes, sometimes quite a bit more depending on AP.

I love this game.  All I want in the owrld is more everything, as it doesn't get samey at all, but that I think there could be even cooler and complex actions possible if the designer were given free reign.

I loved Argent, but it's a long game, so it hits the table less.  This is a great evening after work, morning before family time game and it's quickly pushed all other short games to the side.  I say this at 14 plays and I feel like I missed a few, but hey, I'll probably be playing at least another 14 :)

Easy to learn, easy to teach, and fairly quick to play.  This is a perfect game to introduce to people unfamiliar with euro-style board gaming.  As extremely accessible as this game is, I believe there is enough depth to keep it interesting for players used to heavier games.   Repeated plays are enhanced with variable player power, variable player actions, and variable building setup.

This game is a textbook example of a hidden gem. It's got the crunchy puzzle and multiple paths to victory of a much larger, longer game - you get a great worker placement fix in under an hour. The footprint is small, the price is low, but the gameplay is very solid. Turn order determination can be unsatisfying in worker placement games, but this adds a whole great thinky puzzle to that which I've never seen before. Rating may rise with more plays.

[played at Essen] Very attractive look and theme. The gameplay is smooth, but with enough interesting options and (very) different strategies to win. The individual player powers add to the variety. The turn-order mechanic doesn't seem too have much impact (we just choose the action without taking that into account) and the game was quite short. All in all, a good and entertaining game, but not very different from other games in the genre.

Extremely impressed with this on one play with 4.  Tons of game in a small box.  The choices are interesting and varied, and the game flies by in 45 minutes.  I love the initiative system and the extremely asymmetric player powers.  The art is fine, but it functions well enough.  I could see my rating going up.  Trey Chambers is now 2 for 2 for me with Harvest and Argent.

Very impressed after my first play of Harvest.

Love the artwork. After this and Harbour, I hope to see more games in this series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
tl;dr: fine

Oh, what happened here? This game is from TMG, but somehow it looks like it could have been published by Mayfair! Everything is dark green and brown! Ugh!
OK, so I'm not a fan of the look of this game... at all. Luckily, the game is more fun than the artwork. The action selection mechanism and planning involved make this a fun puzzle. Do you go for a lot of buildings? Do you just grow as much as possible for big harvests? So it seems like there are different strategies to explore. Having a ton of different unique abilities available will change things up from game to game, so there is some replay value there.
But I do have to say: maybe it's overkill. I can't see anyone loving this game enough to play it 15-20 times. It works, it's enjoyable, but it's also nothing too new or exciting. So maybe there are more special characters then one will ever need. That being said: better to have more than not enough.

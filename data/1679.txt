Rules slightly complex, but a great game none-the-less.  Another solitaire game.  Very much like a single player Flat Top.  Rulebook game and playtesting notes (in the back) suggested that the game was very difficult to win - however, I only lost a few times.

Bought this game some 15 years ago, back when a boardgame was a mild curiosity, and finally, after a couple of false starts, managed to wade my way through the full standard rules and try it out. 

My initial impression, after playing the introductory scenarios and a standard scenario, is that I should have tried it sooner. It captures the essence of carrier warfare rather well: the puzzle of establishing a good search plan, the mistery of unknown enemy forces that may turn out to be nothing or a massive carrier force, the tension involved in readying aircraft for missions all the while fearing an enemy attack, and the whole feeling of 'eggshells armed with hammers' as you go about resolving airstrikes. 

While the gameplay gives a very good feeling, the game does have its drawbacks: more than complex (although it is that too), the game is very procedurally intensive, with many steps, checks and chart looking up that have to be followed every turn. It demands a lot of patience and concentration to do everything right, and it's fairly easy to skip some step or check if you're not careful. For me this felt like it made the game a bit tiring to play. Furthermore, the nature of it can mean that after an hour of buildup it can be all over in a couple of minutes after a Japanese strike leaves your carriers burning and sinking...

Overall, I think it's a very good game, seemingly faithful to what it represents, and with very interesting and tense gameplay.

This is the best solitaire game I have ever played! (RAF is a close second).  The tension is excellent, the rules are programmed so you learn the system in steps, ala Squad Leader, and the replay value is high.  I have now played this 18 times total and each has been different and each has been a lot of fun.  For anyone who really wants to know what carrier warfare in WWII was like, this is the game to get! :)

The designer had a tough task to come up with a playable and flavoursome solo carrier simulation, and this is about 90% right. It IS complex, but the PI ruleset and the procedural nature of the game takes away some of the pain. He could have opted for simpler systems, but the complicated intelligence subsystems are really neat, as you build a picture of the opposing forces, while contacts ebb and flow around you. The system is granular enough to give a feel of carrier operations, as planes are cycled through your ships from hangar to deck. Some parts could probably stand more detail - airstrikes are obviously the main event, but are handled quite simply, and although the damage control system works well, it is quite straightforward. Takes a while to grasp some of the concepts (air value, revealed air strength), but you get all the core aspects of the carrier experience - cat and mouse hunting of enemy task forces, sudden air attacks out of the blue, fighting fires and fixing flight decks, and some tough decisions about where to deploy your limited resources and manage the competing demands of CAP, scouting and striking. The fascinating context of the Solomons campaign provides a suitably grand background. A classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fascinating and innovative game.  The programmed instruction helps immensely - but you will still make mistakes.  A fair amount of this stems from having only one player to remember the rules.  But once you absorb the mechanics and the strategies gel - Carrier really shines.

In general I am not a big fan of games designed to be played solitaire, but Carrier is an exception and a great game - assuming of course that the subject matter is of interest to you.

This having been said.  After 6 or 7 plays my copy sits on the shelf and I'm not sure I'll ever put it on the table again.  If I had to put my finger on exactly why, I'd say that the game is dry and quite mechanical and I have shelves worth of games that deliver the same tension, challenge and atmosphere for less effort, and perhaps with more historical insight.

I recommend carrier for any and all interested in the theater or Naval warfare.  I'm glad I bought my copy, but I suspect that one day I'll trade it away.

"Carrier" is a paradox.  The game succeeds wonderfully in presenting the situation and decision set of a carrier battle group commander in the 1942 Pacific.  It is dragged down by a rule book that while well written in individual sections is almost impossible to navigate through in the context of a game turn.  I ended up photocopying mine, cutting up the paragraphs and sticking them on blank paper in the game turn order with tables alongside and even that did not ease the pain I had with key concepts such as "Revealed Air Strength" and "Intelligence".  Even setting up a historical scenario was a nightmare.  I would say it took me 4 days to get through Day 1 of one game.  My advice is explicit: do the Programmed Scenarios first, all of them.

I have a fondness for solitaire games, as they usually have unique and/or interesting mechanisms.  There's not much of that here (except the intel system and its interaction with the solitaire force arrival mechanism), but flight operation and combat mechanisms are solid.  The only gripes are search patrols are omnidirectional and a game can end suddenly when a Japanese force pops out of nowhere and knocks one or more carriers inoperable before you can react, though this is historical.  My battles tend to be blowouts for one side or the other with little middle ground.

This is one of better solo games I played. I am not that much solo player. However what I appreciate is really tense fog of war and as many commented interesting and probably realistic behavior of japanese. 

However where it fails for me is usability of game and ease of play. Bigger scenarios are simply too big for me. I can easily imagine playing electronical version of this but manipulating all counters and doing all work with charts and dice is no longer fun. 

However I must admit that I have enjoyed smaller scenarios as they were more manageable.

A fantastic achievement - a solitaire carrier game with full fog of war, uncertain enemy OOB, and flexible scenarios.  The uncertain OOB is probably the most amazing aspect, that is a realistic feature most other carrier games don't give you.  And on the side it has (with 20 minute air impulses) the shortest turn length of any of the carrier boardgames, giving you a natural plane handling cycle like no other.  Unlike many solitaire games, playability is nearly unlimited; I have played this dozens of times.

The price: this is one of the most complex games you are likely to find outside the decades old creeping featurism franchises (ASL, A3R, TK, WiF, etc.) where people are much more tolerant of lots of rules.

One of the best.  This game and Flat Top are _the_ carrier games.  When you spot the enemy, your intelligence reports vary in reliability and can be outright wrong.  The enemy can spot you first and attack you without you even knowing the enemy had a carrier in range.  Hex map.  Movement is rather limited in the game since each turn only represents a few hours.

Another excellent Victory games product. This is the biz for anyone who has wanted to play out a carrier battle solitaire. All the stuff found in games like Flat Top are present, flight deck ops (arming and refuelling) search and aircraft endurance. 
Contact with the Japanese starts abstract, with unidentified contacts sending air points to attack you. As you gain more intelligence (in game that is) the Japanese fleet is resolved.
Very complex, but with programmed instruction. Good replayability due to design your own rules (also in Tokyo Express, by the same designer).

The problem with a solitaire game where your opponent is determined by a known random table is that there exists an optimal strategy and it only depends on exploiting the random table. Enemy task forces are sort of "non-local" and tend to appear in the places where you look for them - reminds me of quantum mechanics. You lose all the bluff and counter bluff of carrier battles. It has nothing to do with, say, playing Flat Top against a human opponent. The only nice thing is that you can play with the Nimitz nuclear carrier ! Fight Zeros with F-14. I sold it in 1996.

RATING: 7
A detailed simulation with a LOT of stuff to keep track of. It is very educational and gives a feel of what it must have been like to be there in the Pacific WW2 theater, and creates a good detailed "story" each time you play. On the downside, it's long and complicated and easy to forget some rule or another: it certainly feels like a product of its time. I played it back in the day, so have nostalgia for it, but I can imagine it feeling far too complicated and procedural to modern tastes.

Probably various parts of it could have been streamlined or made easier and more consistent. E.g. why are US air units measured in "steps", which are 1/2 the value of Japanese air units, causing various confusions, e.g. that you must remember to double the damage results on the anti-aircraft table when applied vs US planes?

As a [i]game[/i] it is way too random for the amount of time and effort you spend learning and playing it. As a [i]simulation[/i] and "experience" (history, unfolding story, adventure, etc), the detail does add verisimilitude. So it depends what you're looking for.

It is complicated enough that they included 6 (!) learning "scenarios" (mostly short exercises involving some specific game subsystem, e.g. resolve an air strike against a naval force - not really playing the real game per se). The rules are mostly clearly written, but there are some hard concepts to grok (especially concerning the gradually improving levels of knowledge about the Japanese/AI forces, revealed air strengths, how & when various information gets updated, etc) and unfortunately some rule text errors, and more than one version of errata floating around the web (occasionally not even agreeing with each other), and the game is so old and niche that it does not have the useful forum support of some newer more popular wargames, for which a rule question gets answered within an hour or day.

Physical production: not great die cutting (varying widths on the "square" counters) and zillions of annoying side nubs.

I wrote a long blog post about my nostalgic experience relearning and playing Carrier:

A great solitare game.  This game recreates the suspense and lack of knowledge that took place in the early carrier battles in the South Pacific in 1942.

Devious design, deep rule set gives the new player pause, but hidden inside is a superb game of tactics. 

Over the last 4 years my opinion of Carrier has deepened to the point that I believe it is the best non-Ambush! solitaire game made. The depth and breadth this game covers and the intensity truly make it a must own!!

Was lucky enough to get this in a generous trade. Good condition. Box has a lot of shelf wear, but for the age of the game, it's still a solid players copy.

Wow...this is a great solo game.  I've always liked carrier games and played Fast Carriers with a friend until it was ragged. However, this game brought this same excitement to solo play.  It is one of the more complicated solo games and does take time to learn the rules.  However, the time is well worth the effort.  When feeling in a fiesty mood, one can always play "The Final Countdown" scenario and see what a nuclear carrier can do against a WWII Japanese carrier force.

This is my favorite wargame!  I only gave it a "9" because the map feels somewhat cramped and ugly. Sure, the rules are daunting... but with repeated play the rules fade away and the fine game beneath the verbage begins to shine through. After decades of counter-pushing, I like to play the simpler games.  But whenever I feel the need for a detailed simulation I pull this beauty out.  Plus, solitaire, it satisfies the wargaming need when physical opponents can't be found. Actually, there aren't that many chits on map and playing time is somewhat short once you're familiar with the system.  It's only the rulebook consultation which slows the game's pace.  While most wargames lack the "fog of war", Carrier will take you by surprise with air strikes suddenly appearing overhead and bombs falling toward your flight decks from out of the blue. This is a very good game and well worth the effort reading through the rules.  Victory Games always had the best rulebooks and this is well done with a lot of photos in the margins.  A good buy.

Great large scale strategic game.  Dont expect to get attached to individual ships or planes or squad members.  This is you being in charge of the major aspects of task force defence, launching bombing and torpedo attacks, movement and working out all the japanese movement and attacks from numerous charts. This game is an exercise in book keeping and understanding a large and complex rule book. Personally i love it and it is my favorite solo game.  Suits the Anoraks among us who love book keeping and bits of paper and realism over a quick gaming fix. This sounds like a bit of a negative review but it is actually a fantastic game and if you like heavy, time consuming solitaire games its a must.

This is a great game with a lot of depth.  The Japanese are as unpredictable as they are deadly.  Great replayability.

It should be noted that this is a high-complexity grognard's game.  However, the rulebook is very good and anyone with some wargame experience should be able to learn it without much difficulty.

A rare thing in my collection. A game actually designed to be played solitare. And suprisingly it works pretty good. Though I have to admit I've only played a friends copy. Still haven't punched mine.

Another EXCELLENT solo game with incredible fog of war. Rules seem overwhelming but programmed learning appraoch works well and procedurally - though dense - it is rather simple to work through. If you are interested in WWII carrier battles in the pacific this is a must have game. The only other game that comes close to this experience is Flat Top - and that can be expensive to obtain and hard to find another player willing to play it. Can't beat this for Naval solo gaming.

RATING: 9.5
An extremely rewarding solo experience.
Tense and mentally challenging. It really feels decisions you make can (and do) affect the outcome of the battle, yet a very nice "fog of war" system does add into the randomness (kind a like "no plan survives first contact with the enemy"), but also gives a feel you are playing against an opponent (beaviour of the game system is consistent with the Japanese objectives determined at the start).
The rulebook appears daunting at first, but following the advice of the designer and using the the structured rule approach (with immediate, small scenarios to put them into practice) will eventually lead to an extremely smooth play with little reference to the book except for maybe the first full scenario or so.
Variety is offered both from the point of view of several "historical" scenarios, as well as ever-random starting conditions.
Yes, there is book-keeping involved and counter density in one hex can get very high, but I think these are the only two things holding a score of 10. Oh, maybe also the fact that the counters (and maybe the map) could use a "2013 treatment" and get revamped, but this is aestethics and does not affect gameplay at all.
A must have.

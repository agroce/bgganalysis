GAME: Dirtside II

RATING: 8
A great miniature system, with simple rules and a really clever command / morale system. Very few charts, little bookkeeping and quick to play. Can cover small battalion-sized games, as it is a 1:1 scale system. I'm sure you can turn it into a 1:5 and play divisional games ;-)! (Sci-Fi Spearhead anyone?)
The vehicle design rules are really good as well.

Great game for 6-10mm scale sci-fi themed ground combat. The game engine is built around opposed rolls (for instance damage vs armour) and to-hit and damage are determined by a chit system. You draw chits from a cup to read the result. The rules may need a few reading passes at first but once rehearsed a few times during actual play they become very easy to implement and their elegance comes through. 

Overall the basic game mechanics are very solid and fun but many issues plague that otherwise great game. Fortunately all these issues can easily be corrected by various house rules. First of all pretty much everyone agrees that the chit system is clunky. There is an alternate system based on the FMA mechanic in use for Stargrunt II which does a great job at fixing the issue. Also, while I wouldn't call the construction system 'broken' it is wide open for abuse. The point system tends to favour large but cheap, fast-moving, average-tech forces or odd, massive "hammer-in-eggshells" forces. Large vehicles are penalized in that while they have more protection they are easier to hit, yet cost much more. Similarily, ground-effect vehicles move twice as fast as wheel or track vehicles, yet the cost difference is minimal.   

Even though the game is supposed to be "generic sci-fi" it much closer to 'near-future, hard sci-fi' settings. Think "Colonial Marines" from 'Aliens' rather than "Klingon trooper". Also, if ALL the systems and options are used (air support, artillery, etc.) a lot of rolls become necessary and it may bog down the game. Morale and leadership are very important for infantry but almost accessory for AFVs, yet clusters of counters are necessary because of this, as well as bogging the game down.    

As I said the use of the FMA mechanics (or at least a computerized chit drawing program) and a few quick house rules can fix most problems. It is otherwise a great game and the core mechanics are both well-designed and fun.

A very diverse and fun game system of universal use for future miniatures.  A lot of room for house rules,a nd I like the emphasis on morale and troop quality, as well as the dueling dice mechanic.  I would say the rules are somewhat dated for a future war scenario in light of new technologies, but again, you could modify house rules for ISR, UAVs, AI, etc.

Rules are currently out of print but made available as a free download by the publisher, GZG.  Will cross post here shortly.  Had to down grade my rating from a 10 to an 8.  Not pleased with the design or combat systems.  Still a very good set for large sci-fi games.

A great set of generic micro scale sci-fi rules.  It's chartless and pretty much NO bookeeping.  It's basically a micro armor game, but it does it very well and plays fast.  You can easily finish a large battle in a single evening.  I highly recommend this one.  Best of all, you can insert any background and any miniatures and you are ready to play.  It beats the pants off of Games Workshop Epic stuff.  Has an interesting chit draw system to check for fire results.  Could even be used to play modern or near future battles.  Excellent system.

Not as high on the complexity scale as it might first appear. The troop quality and morale mechanisms give the game a good feel. Plays very quickly and accommodates a wide range of situations without breaking down.

Great game! The Full Metal Anorak system rules. Sadly our group plays way too much 40K to really enjoy these...

RATING: 6
Generic 6mm, which is good. My only play was against a corner-caser, though, which meant a fataly un-fun game. (The point system is nice, but can be broken for one-off games.) Decent diversity in equipment for a generic game, but I don't recall command playing a big role: an odd thing for a ground-based wargame, but it might also be my faulty memory.

Like the system.  Scf-fi ground combat at squad level.  The build your own force is cool.  Finding someone to play against is not.

RATING: 8
Even though its a decade old, its has held up well.  Sci-Fi theme is well done in this game, the best part being the TOTAL customization of your entire force to suit your style. This is a much refreshing change from something like 40K where you are restricted to the list of your chosen army faction, a few of which seemed to overpower the others.  Also the variety of unit types is very comprehensive. Only slight complaint is the chit draw system for damage can be tedious at times.

Didn't like so much that the game required carboard chits next to my carefully-painted lead, also didn't care for the assembly-kit nature of having to define my own forces, but these points are down to taste. Would like to try it again sometime.

Dirtside II is an excellent scifi microarmor game.  The rules are generic enough to use whatever figs you want.  Nice command, control, and morale rules.  The chit damage system is a little annoying, but that's my only complaint.

Good set of generic miniatures rules.  There IS a storyline included in the rules, but the rules are so open that you don't need to play in that storyline's universe (from the Full Thrust Starship Combat Rules).

I've only played this a few times.  It would get a higher rating if it wasn't so generic.  Being generic, it loses some of the 'heart' normally found in games with a decent back-story.

DS2 is an excellent game.  If you like 1/300th scale combat, DS2 is a great system to use for micro-armor combats in modern and near future settings.

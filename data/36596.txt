Decent.  Feels weird, because it seems like many cases would involve several parts of your army doing nothing every turn, but that seems to be pretty common in Ancient war games.  Probably not meaty enough to be a game I play all the time, but something I will likely play again.

'Ancient Battles Deluxe' is an excellent revision of the old 'Ancients' games. Very refreshing updated rules and counters keep the older game's charm with a new excitment level and more challenging play. Give's a much better historical feel than the previous game.

Great tactical little game. Not so pretty and the melee rules are a little weird at first but very fun. Tactical type play, no cards. Tough to get a good combat mod strong enough to make a different without using leaders effectively. Make sure to pay attn to opponent movement allowance and how many actions you have left. 

The units, scenario cards, and map really need updating for the price. Very expensive

Facing is new to me. Good system, although the novelty of the combat mechanics is possibly as unsatisfying to me as they are novel. 

Probably my go-to for ancient warfare, as GBoH looks overwhelming. 

Edit March 2017 - I'm thinking that I'll keep ABD around for a quick game, but it's too bare bones after all. Maybe at least SGBoH ...

RATING: 7.25
A nice basic system although the base game could have done with some more scenarios. I would have preffered a generic map with overlays for particular battles - info regarding ancient battlefields is so scant it seems pointless to produce specific maps.

Would like a couple of the expansions to round out the game but they are a little expensive, now ridiculously expensive, for what they are.

RATING: 7.3
Sometimes less is less, and sometimes less is more.  The addition of the command and formation rules are a major improvement on the original.  They, in my opinion, are the game.  I appreciate the trade-off: so few units on the board requires some abstractions that cause problems. Pleasant and interesting diversion that only takes slightly more time to take out of the bag, set up, play and re-bag, than it takes to set up a typical GBoH game.

A simple wargame using game mechanics that are a little different but intuitive after the first game. Everything needed for 1000+ years of battles is presented in a very manageable way. Immediately after finishing each game I wanted to play another. This is good stuff, grand tactical historical gaming without the headaches.

I discovered this game after being fed up with Battlelore & searching for an alternative.

Deciding how to spend Command Points & where to position leaders seem to be the key to the game.

Leaders are so important!  The extra CPs they give you are often critical.

I've found a few of the scenarios can be very unbalanced (Legnano's the worst so far), particularly when you start with a different number of leaders.  Maybe the weaker side could get a few lucky die rolls & that will help.  Ultimately you can only do so much & it's up to fate (dice) to determine the rest.

Some variant ideas of mine:

I'm now thinking about treating Elephants as they're printed rather than skipping the ratio step (or giving them +2 as I once suggested).  Also, if they attack your own cavalry, they don't get the cavalry bonus.  This makes them the same as the original Ancients game (though the combat system is different here).

More interestingly I'm thinking about [u]always giving the attacker an additional +1 modifier in Melee Combat.[/u]  This will help balance out the bias for an equally matched defender to have a better outcome in combat (but it's not really equal until the attacker gets to +2).  As a result we might see might see players choose to attack more in the games I play (& should see a few less suicide attacks).  Good ordered attackers getting eliminated in an equal battle (no modifiers) should now happen 6% rather than 17% of the time.

RATING: 6
Hmm. Some interesting ideas which I've not seen before (leader placement and removal, and the combat resolution system, which I actually liked) but there's not much period flavour, and only one map with terrain on it is really not enough even for the scenarios which need it (a modular system would have been much better). There is a lot of luck in the dice rolls.
It's not for me. I can't see why you'd play this over C&C: Ancients or DBA (which it borrows from, I think) - both play in a comparable amount of time, are easier to teach, more fun and about as historically accurate (i.e. as far as anything can be on ancient battles).
One cool thing about it: you can play it on an airline tray table (even in economy class!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While I'm somewhat knowledgable about ancient warfare, I'm not much of a wargamer. Which means that ABD suits me just fine. 

When I've got the itch to simulate an ancient battle, I like the relatively small physical and mental footprints of the game. Also a fan of the scenario variety once you mix in the first two expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After an initial play, I'm in love with the system.  It's quick playing and straightforward.  It took me three hours to get through it but that was with a lot of rules checking.  I bet I play my next in 90 minutes.  Additional knowledge of history is needed to really make the game come to life, as without any context the game could feel very neutral.

But the game is well suited for solitaire and face to face gaming which is great because my other ancient games most certainly are not.

Includes expansions 1-4.

A really neat game.  It gives a good feel for Ancient warfare without a lot of rules.  Leadership is key, as is taking advantage of position.  I like the feel it gives without a lot of complexity and with a quick playing time.

I was hoping  for this to be lighter GBoH. But this game is too simplistic. Now I understand why some say that it is even lighter than Command and Colours: Ancients.

My history with this game has been checkered: I bought the game in April of 2009, and although it is obviously not intended to be a complex game, a rule book presented in the tired, staid, and almost impossibly jargony war game language made infamous by Avalon-Hill and others really bogged it down for me. 

So initially I rated the game as a "5", essentially being one that's probably good in design but badly limited by a poorly written rule book, rendering me indifferent to it. That is, I had to take a lot of time I could have been playing the game to wade through the writing and simplify it, or even figure out places where entire references were missing. Some of the writing was pretty tortured, and I found this one very fiddly for a war game rated on the 'easy' side of the scale. 

So for a while I had the game up for trade, or considered selling it. However, I didn't give up on it, and by July of 2010, after a long hiatus, I revisited the game after having rewritten the rules into something I could comprehend--mainly by taking out the jargon and in particular, rewriting the description of how 'melee' combat works (actually, a relatively simple design central to the game, but an approach made more than tedious by the writer's use of jargon terms). 

Even then, I still wasn't sold on it being better than "C&C Ancients" or a similar type and complexity of ancient battle game. However, at that time I upgraded my rating from 5 to 6, because after my rewrite I at least felt it was something I could play at times. And, I also felt that to be fair, I might revisit my rating once I replayed all the scenarios. 

By September of 2010 I played the game more and had reached the point where I didn't feel I had to constantly refer back to the rule book to see if I was playing correctly. Given that at that stage, game play was starting to flow better, I raised my rating from 6 to 7. And, by September of 2012 I raised my rating another point, to 8, which is about the highest rating I can give a game of this relatively low complexity. 

By late 2010 I finished playing all the scenarios in the basic set and knew the game well enough that I felt more compelled to replay scenarios as soon as I completed one play--to see how they played out differently. In December of 2010 I decided to order Expansion Kit #1: "Elephants at War." To me, ordering an expansion means I'm sold on the basic game system and intend to play the game regularly, so I'm looking for new scenarios with which to expand my game-playing experience. On that basis, as of January 2011--one year and 8 months after my initial purchase (April 2009), my rating of this game had gone from 5 to 7. 

Therefore, "Ancient Battles Deluxe" is a good example of what can happen when one sticks with a game that shows some promise, but for various reasons takes time to figure out or appreciate. This can be true of games of any complexity level. 

In my experience, other games that fit into this low-complexity category--'seems good but gosh, are the rules hard to follow!'--are "Hellas" and "Lightning: Midway." Of course, one has to decide which games seem worth the effort. I could certainly name games that for me would not be worth such an undertaking, but that's a whole different topic. 

In June of 2012 I added Expansion #2. Acquired Expansion, #3, "Strange Ordnance," August, 2012. By then my rating had gone up to 8, and by the end of 2012, with more than 40 plays, I bumped it up another half notch, just because I enjoy it and I know I'm going to pull it back out regularly.

RATING: 7
A clean, simple, fast-moving game system.  Covers numerous ancient and medieval battles in a very small, manageable way.  Not usually my favorite period, but a nice change of pace.  Provides a taste of tactical warfare and a window into ancient times.

The novel combat system takes some getting used to, but it works just fine.

A good update of the Ancients system.  On the fence about which I like better, though the command points system of this one is a good way to restrict the ability to move and fight with everything.  Gift to Randy.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable tactical system. I like it enough that I created [[Ancient Battles Deluxe FAQ]].

It has more scenarios than I'll probably ever finish playing (especially with the expansions), but I am soloing my way through them (hoping that eventually I'll get some friend interested in playing them too).

Main downside: the hexes are a bit small, so it can get a little physically fiddly in dense map areas.

Also the counters are old style VPG quality, i.e. they shed weird white paper fuzz from their edges. But after trimming them with my Oregon Laminations counter clipper, I like them. And I still prefer old style VPG counters to the burned black soot of VPG's new laser cut counters, even if VPG's new game counters are thicker. :)

The unusual combat resolution seems to confuse people at first, but it's actually simple once you grok it, and it's clearly described.

ABD is much simpler and quicker to play than GBOH (typically an hour or 2 at most for a scenario), but of course is also less detailed/chromey than GBOH. If a more generic feel bugs you, then ABD might not be for you.

And it's more traditional / wargame-ish than C&C Ancients. So it seems to hit a nice "sweet spot" for me and other ABD fans.

Wargame bastante accesible pues el nivel de reglas es básico, eso sí no deja  ningún cabo suelto y tiene reglas para el encaramiento, moral, distintos tipos de unidades...
Debido a que abarca un periodo de tiempo tan amplio no se puede decir que sea muy exhaustivo pero sí muy divertido y además en media hora tienes un escenario ventilado!!!

I was skeptical as I watched the development process toss the original's classic CRT (a work of art), but I have to admit the new system also works well.  The new command rules change play quite a bit.  All in all, I like it, and the fact that all the components are back-compatible with Banks' original rules is a huge plus.

Gave it an 8 instead of a 9 as not designed to be primarily a solo player.  However, even friends who do not play board games enjoy the accurate "feel" of its slow moving ancient combat and the tension created on the battlefield. A Melee Combat Calculation Sheet helps them (and myself) quickly get through the combat calculation. Best part of the combat is how logical it all feels.  A great combination is to read one of G.A. Henty's novels and then fight it on the battle field.

My only prior experience with the system was from Thapsos &  Alexandria, as well as Marathon and Granicus from S&T.  This new iteration has breathed life into what was once a very static system.  Very nice little game, good for when space or time is tight.

Bland, boring, and uneventful - nothing more than a glorified DTP at an outrageous price.

Counter-intuitive combat system is novel but also a major pain.

Centered around scenario flexibility, strong emphasis on leadership.

Still, this system takes a back seat to SimpleGBoH or C&C: Ancients, which are much better games/systems.

ABD is an update of Ancients. The components have been improved, but I still prefer the counters in the older Ancients game. The unit images represented on the counters lack visual detail. ABD tries to update the game with some new rules which results in making the game more complicated than it should be. A perfect example is the new combat system which is way overly complicated. I'm still unable to figure it out. I play ABD with the improved components but use the earlier Ancient rules set.

There are some compelling things about the game - Leader quality determines the total number of unit activations as well as having DRASTIC effect on unit combat values - this fell solid - especially compared to GBOH to be honest - where leaders value comes their ability to trump/command radius. I think that I would like to see some kind of merging of these concepts.

I also like the portability of the system - being able to get a solid wargaming experience is not to be undersold.

But because the combat table, it fell flat. Being able to effect casualties was fairly difficult. The only way to eliminate a unit is to get 3x their strength - and for this, you are at the mercy of the dice. For example, your combat value is 3x the defender - this means that you get +3 to your combat roll and add in a leader you are at +4. Then you have the dice off. Defender rolls a 5 and you roll a 2 - final results 5 vs 6 - means they are engaged - i.e. no effect. (and it would have the same result if you rolled a 6) Thus, in order to effect any sort of impact, you need to have the defender roll 3 (or better yet 1 or 2).

So, in the end, it did not feel like a proper simulation - but too generic (which did not surprise me given the rules depth). Thus, for my ancients, I will stick to GBOH/MOI (and the associated chrome - but at least the battles "feel" closer to what I expect

A fantistic little game that, once mastered, is quick, exciting, and infinitely replayable through the creation of any ancient battle setup. There are a ton of scenarios and several maps to keep you engaged, but you can also make terrain tiles to suit your needs.

There's a strong emphasis on leadership (i.e. modified melee strength, base combat modifier), battleline cohesion/formations, morale (i.e. army panic & rally), and of course your ultimate plan. All injected with just enough luck (i.e. base combat value die roll) to simulate the chaos of hand-to-hand combat and the possibility that your grand plan might fall apart. As an old Prussian general once said: "No plan survives contact with the enemy."

RATING: N/A
Nice update of Ancients, just as easy to play, but with modernised mechanics. There's more to it, certainly, but the rulebook is clear & easily referenced 9albeing there's too much highlighting and coloured fonts, as usual for VPG). A bit of fiddly arithmetic around combat resolution makes solo play annoying, but there are play aids a-plenty to assist.

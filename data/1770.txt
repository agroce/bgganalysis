With modified rules, this game could be playable. The game uses a relentless mechanic to beat you, but you rely solely on luck to win.
A nice use of a wounded mechanic, but you rarely survive to use it.

Self produced.
The game that got me into BGG.
I was given the expansion but never get the original.
In time, and between moves I lost it, and always keep on eye out for it.
And here I got the files, so I printed and "LetÂ´s rock..."
One more advantage, solo play. Near perfection with this.

In my quest to sort through my old collection, which i rescued from an attic after more then a decade of absence from board gaming i came to Aliens. This one rocks: easy rules, fast gameplay, lots of action. The first scenario is a blast. The second a bit tedious and the third is a nice little bonus. The gameplay is close to Space Hulk, but faster. The South Shall Rise Again is similar in concept, but somehow lacks the spark that makes you go on. I should give it another try, after my pleasant rediscovery of Aliens.  

Old collection.

Reactor core portion is fun to play solo. The rest is forgettable.

RATING: 9
Not only the ultimate movie-themed boardgame but also the best easy-to-learn tactical combat-game ever bar none. the way this game elegantly simulates with it's well-written rules-set the heart-wrenching dillema's the marines have to face being surrounded by an overpowering deadly enemy...sheer brilliance. No other horrorgame creates such a claustrophobic intense mood. Hunt down the minis for this one, even when they cost an arm and a leg. It's a fantastic investement since they boost up the game considerably visualy.
The only weak point of this edition wich keeps it from getting a 10 is the awful map-art wich just seems to be made by a couple of teens during a first artclass. I have been re-designing the maps with superior artwork and hope to give them a test-run soon.

Placed on the table at the games club I have just started attending by another newbie.  An hour's dice rolling and randomness.  One player almost instantly lost both characters due to Aliens landing on him.  A sort of gallows humour prevailed to see us through.  My characters potential suicides were quickly on my mind.

So much fun playing this game.  My copy I purchased for 14.00 at a flea market is beat all to hell from so many plays.  Lots of stuff you want to do, but never enough action points to do them, and then there are the endless, unrelenting aliens to ruin your day.  I have the original, and the expansion, and the only part that see's any play, is the first mission because it is a classic.  Too bad a)this game has not been re-printed and/or re-themed and 2) it costs SO much on ebay, when you can find a copy.

Box dented and dinged. Contents great, map is near perfect, as is rulebook. Has the large reference card, 16 character cards. Rules do not indicate how many there should be.

I've only played the online version, but what a cool solitaire game this is.  It's more theme over gameplay, as this game is very hard. The first scenario "The Reactor" is the best and most balanced.  But no matter how well you do in that, "Operations is almost impossible to survive. Due to the limited ability for troop placement, you can almost guarantee massive casualties leading to a loss.  There's just no good fire zones in this death trap, and there's too much waiting before you can try to exit the room.  "Rescue Newt" is a nice challenge.

A fantastic game for fans of the movie and a great co-op game for anyone else. Creates a great sense of fear as you desperately try to keep your marines alive in the face of an overwhelming hoard.

Incredibly tough the first few times you play, but very satisfying the first time you get everyone out alive.

Really good game based on their Phoenix Command game but more streamlined. It feels very thematic and it plays very well. It's let down by the components, especially the board. Not bad for it's time but it could be so much better if it had the look of Space Hulk which came out at the same time and was a better game.

I don't have the book, but I scored a nice set of well-painted Leading Edge minis, both Marines and Aliens.  I'd like to develop rules for a more open-ended skirmish game using the tiles available in the files section.  Or a version of Patrol: Lost!

Need: eggs (Sculpey?) and more facehuggers.  Chestbursters?

The Newgrounds flash implementation is probably the best way to play the original version of this game.  As a cpu game, I'd give this a 6 - based purely on my low patience for cpu games relative to board games.  If I had a human opponent and could use my miniatures, probably a 7-8.

I did give this game a score of 5 this must have been a nostalgic haze. The thought of playing this game again scared we witless.  I definitely got an adverse flashback of endlessly boring game sessions in the 1980's.

I find really difficult to rate this game I think that if it is played at pace that it has some appeal but it has no hidden depths.

The game's very old and I just discovered it last year but man! The mechanics are so clever that being so simple and so dependent on a single die roll doesn't make the game too random or less strategic. And the theme is so much in it. You really feel overrun by the aliens...

Would be a 10 but the second scenario's rules are not very well edited. It's unclear how the second part of the scenario works.

This game is a total blast, with the right group. Cooperative play, in which each player controls one or more of the characters in the movie and tries to survive as bugs drop from the ceiling, attack from every direction, oftentimes exploding in a deadly spray of acidic blood, caused by your own (or your teammate's) gunfire. It is a good adaption of the movie, almost to the point of being ridiculous, with some of the minor special rules. Much of it is down to luck and some of the characters are imbalanced, but who gives a crap, because it's one-metric-ton of fun. Definitely check out the [gameid=7469], because it adds some interesting gameplay. The Queen is a death machine!

Before there was Star Wars Epic Duels, there was Aliens. I owned the original print until a disaster took away several of my classic games. I have since recreated the game and while there are many newer games of this type with fine miniatures and detailed rules, this one still holds a special place in my heart if only for being able to play the epic Ripley/Alien Queen battle as a kid.

RATING: 6
I know its not fair to compare this to Doom, since thats a newer game - but I found this game to be lighter, and lacking in the tension of Doom. On the plus side, everyone gets to play (since their is no GM). Willing to play this over Doom occasionally since it is quicker, and everyone can play a marine...

"All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony, and that a xenomorph may be involved."

Have always liked this since first playing it in the late 80's. Thought does need to go into the moves, but it plays fairly quickly with people who know what they're doing. If you like the movie (as I do) then it helps.

Fun, easy-to-learn game. Good solitaire capability; Good game flow. The game conatains 4 scenarios, but The Reactor Room scenario is the only really good one. Aliens randomly appear on the map, and as a result, luck is a large part of the game. The game (and the ability to win) is greatly altered if an Alien drops on a couple marines on the first round. Playing the Aliens, however, is mindless and intails no strategy. The game has very limited replay capability.

Okay, this is far more fun that it has any right to be. The scenarios generally decline in quality (first best, second okay, and the third a joke), but Aliens manages to be 100% thematic with no chromey FFG nonsense. It's fast, brutal, unfair, but a lot of fun--even if the components suck.

Well, what can I say - I'm a huge fan of the first three movies! But this game is cool, anyway... one of the few that you can actually play alone (as the moves of the aliens are obvious), or as a team vs. the aliens - we even played it against aliens AND another team of marines once (don't ask about the outcome, haha). Oh, I also have the British OPERATION ALIENS BOARDGAME from Peter Pan Games... it's cute and highly collectable, but less exciting than the Leading Edge game.

Fast and furious skirmish battles.  It starts slow and easy to handle and then ends up with aliens swarming you in the end. Very tense!  The first scenario is great, very simple and tense, the 2nd scenario is fun but it REALLY gets bogged down with all the rules and the constant "when this happens, then that happens, and soon after this other thing happens" and the 2nd scenario rules are none too clear either. I've played twice, scenario 1 & 2.  I lost 2 marines in scenario 1 and none (besides Burke) in scenario 2 though in both games an incapacitated marine had to be carried out. The scenario with the queen and Ripley is pretty lame.

The Reactor Room scenario is good fun and very chaotic (preserving all the atmosphere of the film).  The rules are easy to pick up and the game can be made quite tough for the marines.  Be sure to pick up the expansion.  Very suitable for cooperative play - it generally works best if each player gets at least one of the "good" marines (Hicks, Apone, Vasquez, Drake) along with one of the "cannon fodder" (Crowe, etc.).  I don't know how many times I've played it over the years - quite a lot though.

Leading Edge also made several sets of miniatures for this which really improve the look of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game with many people or just one. I have never had so much fun losing in my life. Due to the randomness of the alien appearance you can never count on what will happen next. One minute you can be walking through the game and the next, half of your squad is gone because of bad alien drops and that acid splash. Light on the strategy although there is some but heavy on the fun. "Hicks, We are leaving".

RATING: 3
Spawn aliens, possibly right on top of your people. Shoot at the aliens, possibly taking out some of your people with the acid splashes. Spawn more aliens. Try to move forward whenever aliens aren't on top of your people, which isn't most of the time. Launch a grenade when you realize that just shooting at each new wave of aliens isn't a winning proposition, possibly taking out most of your people in the process. Do all of these things many times until your people are all dead, or you hit a lucky streak with the dice. If you love Nethack, then maybe this is for you.

The Flash version seems to take some liberties with spawn rates, chances to hit and line of sight, but it also performs many hundreds of die rolls for you.

A cooperative "dungeon crawl" recreating the second Alien movie with the Colonial Marines fighting waves of aliens.  A very underrated and fun game.  (Also now rare and expensive.)  This game is begging for a reprint.  This one is from the late 80s.  The game only comes with cardboard standees, but there were also minis that could be purchased aftermarket.  I don't have the minis, because they also go for a pretty penny, but I plan on getting them someday.  The map is also only paper, but the gameplay is excellent, so the component shortcomings don't kill the enjoyment.  :-)

I have only played the online version versus an AI, but this gives me a nice fill for the small squad tactical games that I love. I am pretty sure the computer is cheating though.  Interesting mechanics that feel like Space Hulk but in a much more open environment, not as tactical as Space Hulk but a decent substitute. I wouldn't need to buy the actual game, as the components seem subpar for other games that are in the same vain.

Anyone who owns the original game should play with a photocopied map (or use one of the many re-imagined maps found online). In doing so you will save a lot of wear and tear on the original paper map which can become weathered very quickly.

For the movie series fans, this is packed with theme. Prepare your Hudson impersonation. Some scenarios could be better, but they add variety.

Mediocre production (upgradable with minis), chart referencing, minor bookkeeping, and steady dice rolling detract from play. The fan-made character cards look like a substantial chart upgrade.

Nice and intense for a board game. You're gonna loose members, its a fact. Kind of simple, but fun.The game revolves around the movie, so the scenarios and replay are limited.

MEDIUM priority, because of cost, and I'm unsure how much replayability this has and how deep it is. It's too expensive to buy on a whim, who knows if I'll ever own it. But it's got aliens...and little aliens bursting out of chests...and guns...and stuff.

Undeniably one of most action packed, tense, and fun board games ever made. It will make all the difference if played correctly with those that can immerse themselves into the theme. Don't make the mistake of playing with those that have not seen, or don't appreciate, the first two movies! Never have I played a game with more genuine groaning when a team member was captured or killed, or where there was more genuine cheering when escaping by that narrowest of margins!

Love this game. The cooperative play makes it a rare gem, and the theme of the movie is fulfilled. For a fast, fun paced game where everybody plays as a team this is the bench-mark.

This was a tabletop favorite among non-wargaming friends back in the late 80s, early 90s. The game's components aren't the highest quality, but it succeeds in one crucial area--theme and degree of difficulty appropriate to the movie. It's beer and pretzels for sure, but in this case, that's meant as high praise. The game accomplishes what it sets out to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A thematically rich co-op which can be good fun. In Scenario 1, you need to get your team of guys to the other end of the room - the more that get home the better you've done. The choice you make each turn is whether to spend action points to shoot at aliens (the more APs you use, the higher the chance of rolling a kill) or spend 'em moving towards the exit door. It's easy to die if an alien gets to you, and they move way faster than you, so there's a fair bit of shooting ... and a fair bit of death as well. Aliens can land each turn on any one of 90 spaces, so together with the die rolls to kill, there's lots of randomness. In the second scenario, it's more of the same, but you need to stand and overcome an initial onslaught, and then move through the tunnels in single file to get out. Good for the guys at the front of the queue, not so much for the readguard. The scenarios are lifted straight from the movie, together with the matching of weapons to the characters, so there's a great thematic link. There are some minor tactical decisions re placement as there's a fixed turn order. But it is a rack-em, roll-em dice-fest. At 60 mins a scenario, that's fine for the occasional romp.

(10+ plays)  A fun cooperative game with lots of dice rolls.  The first scenario is great, and certainly a tactical strategy game with lots of flavor.  The second is TOUGH, and it takes awhile to even formulate a workable strategy.  It's a total crapshoot dice-wise, but if you do well in the first scenario and are playing the movie scenario where you get to take your surviving characters from scenario 1, it can be a real nail-biter.  The third scenario, Ripley vs. the Queen is just silly.  It's just a bunch of dice rolls, and there are no decisions that are not obvious.  Scenario 3 is pointless, except for flavor if you want to play the three in succession.  I think you would primarily play the first scenario, and move onto the second just for fun, if you've done well on the first.

An excellent game that captures the feel of the movie. Characters have 2 or 3 action points that they can use to move /or/ attack, really playing into the tension that was evident in the movie of "run-or-gun". The Aliens operate by a simple algorithm, making this an excellent solo or cooperative game.

The sole downside is that, like many co-ops, the scenarios tend toward solvability, especially the very first one. This can skew your performance in the campaign game, since you can get out of the first scenario with way too many survivors.

An easy-to-learn game that really captures the atmosphere of the movie. The squad-based strategy changes depending on the current Marines alive and their positions.

I've played this game more than any other game I've ever played.  The total plays is probably closer to 500 than 100, but I don't know exactly how many times.  Most all of the plays have been over 20 years ago.  I did bust it out just a couple months ago and played a couple of times - the game is still a timeless classic.  The design is just about perfect - it solos well, but also makes a great multiplayer game.

A fantastic and highly atmopspheric game covering the key battles of one of the greatest movies ever made!
Unfortunately the components are incredibly UGLY!!! The maps must be the most unesthetic IÂ´ve ever seen-they look like some five year old has painted them! So you MUST buy some decent minis,paint them and print a nice board. What expects you when you play this game with 28 mm minis on some atmospheric boards can only be described as phenomenal. I know of no other game that catches the atmosphere of the movie this well! You can almost hear the screams of the xenos and the firing of the pulse rifles! This is a game that has passed the test of time and is a delight to play. I would have given it a 10, but because of the ugly components, it gets a 9.

And always remember: "SHORT, CONTROLLED BURSTS!"

[2 plays] This game to me fills the role if being a late night convention filler.  After a day of playing more strategic complex games, if you are looking for something a bit lighter play this.  Especially if the GM has full size action figures and a giant 3D setup.  Nothing is great about this game really, a lot of random dice rolling and fairly intuitive positioning.  However, like I said it finds it sweet spot as a good convention filler game that can be some good group fun.

An unusual experience - the first scenario was tense, nicely tactical and enjoyed by both of us. The second scenario started promisingly, we then passed a lucky 'conscience check' (IIRC, a 10% chance of success, but we'd have three goes at it) on the first roll which sucked all of the tension out of the game. The third and final scenario (the Powerloader Ripley vs. Alien Queen) is awful and entirely random. A terrible end to an otherwise good, and possibly very good, game. Production quality leaves a lot to be desired though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Cooperative.  Players are the marines trying to escape the doomed planet crawling with hostile aliens which move by automatic rules.  Very moody, since the aliens move far faster than the humans can, and even though the ranged weapons of the humans are devastating, the aliens are far more deadly at melee range.  Can easily be played solo.

This is an all around great game. There is an ease to the set up & rules. It is a great game to introduce new players to & it's a great time even when the aliens win. Although the scenarios are limited, there is enough variation to keep it fresh & interesting. Combine it with the expansion & you can play the movie including changes as 'your' interactions with the aliens become different from the movie. I only wished that I invested in the miniatures back in the early 1990s. The only other items you may need is the movie's soundtrack & sound effects of the weapons fire with the aliens screams. You can provide the screams for the unfortunate marines... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent team game, simple mechanic but turns out to require solid fire-and-movement tactics.  It's too easy to leave your machine guns in the rear, or expose your flamethrowers to alien attacks, and before you know it they're all over you.  Probably only really for fans of the film, and suffers due to very restricted (film-oriented) scenario set.

RATING: 7
Fun game. Love the first scenario in the reactor room. That's always been my favorite scene from the movie and now I can experience the same desperation as the characters. The second scenario isn't nearly as fun as the first though. This game works great by yourself or with a couple others, gets clumsy with more than that. Not for everybody, but definitely for fans of the movie or those looking for a quick, easy game. Bonus bugs can make it even more challenging. Overall good game.

Dang, this is one highly thematic, and fun cooperative, simulation of the action scenes from Aliens. I don't own the actual board game, but would love to see a reprint (FFG would do this justice IMO).

The Flash implementation is great.

Even though I don't consider Aliens to be one of the greatest sci-fi films to grace the screen, but I still enjoyed the game immensely and it was a blast to play with people that know the movie inside and out.  It had the uncanny ability to evoke tension especially when situation becomes desperate, much more than any other cooperative titles I've tried.  If you're a fan, you definitely owe it to yourself to seek this out.

I got this years ago when I was living in Phoenix. I played it twice. My roommate at the time sequestered himself in his room and played he claims over a hundred times over several weeks, he said he only won the game handful of times.

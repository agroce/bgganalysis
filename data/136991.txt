Loony Quest took me by a surprise. It looks like a game any serious gamer would steer away, and I admit, there is no way you can call the game serious. However, it is a lot of fun. We played with all adults and had a blast, but I can imagine how much fun this would be with kids, or in a party.

The game does not offer much strategic depth and only a few tactical decisions regarding playing order, how big risks to take, or when to use power ups. But that is not the point of the game, I think. It is all about having fun.

Longevity might be an issue, since I can imagine that you do not want to play the same levels too many times. But creating your own will not be problem, and may prove to be almost equally fun.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I was pretty interested in this game for a couple of reasons. Firstly because of the artwork, which is simply stellar, and secondly because of the whole arcade video-game idea behind it. It's something that plays on my nostalgia, I guess. After trying a couple of rounds though, I quickly lost interested in Loony Quest.

Even for a light/family game I find this one to be a little too light and, especially, repetitive. The "level design" goes out of its way trying to present constantly with new mechanisms and challenges... but I think it ultimately fails in its intent, because at the end of the day all you do is still simply drawing on a transparent sheet. It's something that for most adults won't represent any kind of challenge. On the other hand I think that Loony Quest could be a very good game for kids and for many reasons: it can help developing spacial intelligence, it appeals to their natural interest for drawing and the artwork is something that will easily catch their attention.

Bottom line Loony Quest is a decent game, particularly so if played in a family setting that includes younger kids. It's not however a very interesting game outside that audience and therefore it's not the kind of game for me right now.

ok, here we have a good drawning game. The theme is great and the art too (remebers me final fantasy in the SNES age). You don't need be a artist here, but if you have a good space vision on the table, you play better than you friends. Good to play with kids (my son loved our first try) and the last levels are very hard. Good one to stay in collection cause is different than others drawning games.

1st play: This one is pretty similar to Doodle Quest which I have played before and liked enough.  I prefer Loony Quest, the extra rules add just a touch more interesting bits and the levels create just a tiny bit of story.  The boss fights are neat and mix things up.  The kids really enjoyed it and that's who I bought it for, so I'd play it anytime.

An eye/memory-hand coordination game and there aren't so many of those.  It works fine, with handicaps imposed by bombs adding to the hilarity.  I do wonder whether my experience will be any different next game - and therefore how often I'll want to replay this.

The artork is bright and jolly.  Production quality is good, though the erasers on the pens aren't great.  You'll probably want some tissues on standby.

This is a very creative fun game. I highly recommend it. Unfortunately it gets a 7 from me because my wife is just TOO GOOD at it. Most people laugh at how bad they are at the game and it creates a fun experience. My wife just gets everything and usually beats me by 30 or 40 points(a VAST amount) which can take some of the joy out of the game.

Végre egy eredeti partijáték! Nagyon jó az alapötlet, és elég jól körbe is járja a témát, bár én csak 1 világot próbáltam. Erre az ötletre még 30 kieget rá lehet húzni, de nem tudom hogy nem unnék-e rá. Szerintem aki jól rajzol az egy kis előnyben van. De lehet puszta véletlen is, hogy én ebben is és rajzban is rossz vagyok:))

Light party game with an arcade feel to it. Scoring might be a bit fiddly and shouldn't be taken too seriously. The game box is fully utilized as well as it functions as the score board and also platform for the levels. Artwork is very cartoonish and pleasant. This is a good filler party game to play with non-gamers.

It's a gimmicky game but at least it's done very well. The components are nice, the artwork pops, and there's plenty of "levels" in the box to keep a group busy for a while. Definitely not a game you're likely to play for more than 30 mins but it's fun.

Fun game that finds a truly unique way to bring the 2d platformer to the tabletop. Having to gauge what you're drawing with your lines, dots, and circles without exact knowledge is a great spacial reasoning challenge. Special tiles add to the zany charm of the game. Simple and fun.

This unique game has players looking at a "level" in the middle of the table, and then drawing on a transparency in front of them to try to match the level as best as possible. This is a little trickier than it sounds, as looking back and forth from the level to your board can make it difficult to get things like spacing correct. 

It's a fun exercise in spatial reasoning and accessible enough for kids, while being plenty enjoyable for adults as well.

RATING: 8
Loony Quest is unlike any other game I’ve ever played: it’s a mix of eye to hand coordination, drawing skills and abstraction merged with an outstandingly developed light theme that both fits the game perfectly and feels unique at the same time.

The only downside is, it seems to have a limited replayability: as soon as you have completed a level (and likely hit all targets therein) it doesn’t urge you to play it again, as it’s just the same map over and over.

Played (demo) at Spiel '14.
This game is based on an awesome idea (drawing a route on a transparent piece of plastic for a course that is in the middle of the table). However, I found the game to lack excitement. Still, it is funny to see other players or yourself completely go off track and get punished for it.

RATING: 7
An awesome concept where players get to view a video game level with stated goals.  For example, you might have to draw a path from one object to another on the level, while avoiding other objects.  The catch is that each player has to draw the path on his own transparency, but with the transparency on the table rather than on top of the puzzle.  Once the timer runs out, everyone gets to place their transparency over the puzzle and see if they drew accurately, scoring points for doing the good things, and losing points for the bad things.

Players may also obtain power ups that may help themselves or hinder others, or accidentally hit bombs that will affect them negatively in the next round.

It kind of stinks that this cool version was done in the entire rest of the world, while the US got stuck with the more family and kid-friendly Doodle Quest.  The difference in coolness between the two games is like the difference between a Buick and a Ferrari.  Fortunately, it's easy enough to order from Amazon.de or an importer.

It's a shame this won't be seeing a US release. This is one of the more creative light and silly games in recent years, and it's quite a good deal of fun.

There's not a ton of content, but the game is damned hard so there's good reason to play and replay the same levels over and over again. Watching yourself improve as you memorize the levels really reinforces the video game feel. It's a quick game, but packed with that suspense and drama of seeing how everyone performed.

Great closer/opener.

RATING: 7
This game is just plain fun! Well, “game” is perhaps not an accurate description as it’s more like an activity. Basically you need to draw a line (or rings or dots depending on the level) and try to do fit it as perfectly as possible so it fits the current level. I.e. you’re taking a look at a picture where you can see where you need to draw; you get bonuses for connecting coins and you lose points if you draw a line onto any of the negative spots of that particular level. But the trick is that you can see the level, but you have to draw it on your own transparent sheet of plastic, and once the 30 seconds is over, you put your sheet over the original picture and see how well it fits!

But you don’t just get some points and lose some points, no, you can also try to strike some of the lightning symbols which gives you extra powers, such as extra VPs, a shielf of protection or the extremely annoying mosquito/bird which you can pass on to one of your opponents (presumably the one who is in the lead – which kind of sucks when you’re doing well that your opponents puts a target on your back, but I guess I understand why…) And at the same time you also have to be aware of not hitting a bomb, which will give you a huge handicap in the next round! The handicaps include switching hands so you draw with your left hand (or right if you’re a leftie!), draw with a stretched arm, holding the pencil with just your thumb and your pinkie etc.! This makes the game much funnier than it would otherwise be!

It is truly great fun, and some of the levels are extremely tough, which makes this game pretty challenging! There are 7 “worlds”, almost all with 6 levels each, and as 1 world = 1 play, you rapidly amasses a lot of playthroughs of this game. And I do fear that it won't be as great in 20 plays, but 20 plays is a lot in my book.

Now, it’s very much a game of skills – you need to have this sort of spatial intelligence which some people simply don’t. However, you can always handicap the better players by giving them some “bombs”, and this is always something I’m fond of in lighter skill games with players of different skill levels. I must say, however, that there is also some luck involved; I’ve seen players losing by like 1 mm (yes I know some will claim this is just lack of skills, but I’d say it’s pretty damn lucky/unlucky whether you hit that wall/target/bomb etc. or not if it comes down to 1 mm!) 

Oh, one thing I didn’t like is the fact that the rules state you cannot have the same number of points… Why is that?! In one of my plays a player gained 3 free points (as you jump ahead onto the next free point space) – how is that fair, and what is the point of this?! Except for that I find the gameplay to be very good, and I’ve had a good time with everybody I’ve played with so far – wife, friends, family, and I’ve played with all the player counts from 2 to 5, and each works well (as there isn’t much player interaction anyway).

Great fun to play. Great game to teach to new people, most explanations can happen on the fly. Mechanics are simple, game itself is challenging.

This game works well for a multitude of players - entry level to proficient.

Even on repeated plays the levels are challenging. Only spotting the elves is done only once. Pity it's not in the US yet as a wider player community might actually bring further user created levels.

One (small) issue: the painting screens tend to get foggy over time. So far it's not an issue yet.

Hopefully there will be expansions soon lest people get to know the solutions too well...

A very fun concept, very simple and games are fast !
You have 30 seconds to draw through the level and avoid monsters, walls and malus. Really fun to apply malus to other people, especially the banana you have to throw :)
The only point is propably the replayability which doesn't seem very high since there's only a finite number of levels available in the box.
If there would be cheap ad-ons or even printable additional levels, I would rate it 8.

Are you kidding me? This game is awesome!  The thing about most board games that are 'like video games' is that they would be better if they were video games. Not Loony Quest! It has all the action, pace and addictive progression of video games but an app would only reduce the hilarity and fun.

I tend to dismiss dexterity or unusual premise games as a gimmick or forced silliness. This is one of the times I actually walked away from the game with more respect for it then when I sat down.

Loony Quest is all about lush artwork and well produced components that many of these games have to seemingly lure in kids. The mechanic is unique, fast in execution, and stimulating as well as filled with laughs.

Likely would never need to own, but would recommend seeking out a copy to play at least once. Great game for a convention as it will attract onlookers.

RATING: 7
A novel concept, and its really really good fun, we played through two of the worlds entirely.

I really like the arcade game style and artworks and even the scoring chits slotting in around the board is a nice touch.

Game play is quick and simple. The game is intuitive and easy to explain. 

The pranks and perils are a nice touch as they add a bit of player interaction to the game and the mosquito prank is really annoying!

This is such a great looking, easy playing and fun family game. The idea is simple and the execution is great. Great production and I had a lot of fun playing it.

The only negative is that the dutch rules are absolutely atrocious. Words spelled wrong, literal translations, poor grammar and even a sentence which wasn't translated at all. I really don't understand how this got to production.

Gyerekeknek, családoknak, illetve ittas felnőtteknek ajánlott rajzolgatós játék. Talán inkább rejtvény vagy valami ilyesmi, semmint társasjáték tekintve, hogy nem is kellenek a többiek hozzá, hogy játsszál. Nem annyira az én világom, de elhiszem, hogy valakiknek nagyon bejöhet, inkább mint háttértársas egy beszélgetés, családi program mellé, semmint fő attrakció.

Oh man, I feel like this game was made for me. On the surface, it's so simple that it sounds like a party game. In actual play, it just feels flat out unique and fun. I am an old school video gamer, and this reminds me of Super Mario Bros, Donkey Kong Country, and Rayman, making it even more perfect. However, folks who never play video games also love this. Excellent! 

How can such a simple game get such a high rating? Because simple does not mean shallow on pure enjoyment and smiles.

Bardzo ciekawy pomysł, na pewno spodoba się miłośnikom platformówek. Gra imprezowa, wymaga wyobraźni przestrzennej, podoba się i dzieciom i dorosłym, a rysowanie z komarem na pisaku wcale nie należy do prostych zadań :) Obawiam się tylko, że po przejściu wszystkich poziomów może się znudzić, co wpłynie na regrywalność.

Original and innovative. Would have been an ideal Spiel des Jahres contender but the Jury said no, because of the boards that are not cleanable 100%.
 The down side I see is that there are only six worlds with each six levels. A level is exact 30sec of playtime. So net time needed or playing the whole game is 18 minutes (Plus some Administrative time for counting points and cleaning boards).  This game will need expansions, arrrh new levels.

Graphically appealing dexterity game. It has a great appeal for the younger, for the family, and those who generally don't play. I found it appealing the first time, the second time it was a little too much. If the mood is right this could be a good filler, yet I'd play something else if I could. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very creative, well presented and fun. It's a new type of drawing game, where the theme is a platformer game. You go through several worlds, completing challenges through drawing. Not figurative drawing, mind you. There's a "level" at the center of the table and you draw on a transparent sheet of plastic. When the timer runs out, that sheet will be overlaid to the level to see how you did. 

For example, you have to get to the end of the level, picking up items and avoiding enemies and walls on the way. The challenges are varied and you can get power-ups to mix things up. Super fast and fun.

Ingenious party game. Definitely worth importing if you enjoy:

- Describing a game and having people give you a quizzical face like, how does that even work?

- Setting out the new board for the next round and having people laugh in surprise at how difficult it looks.

Some of the power-ups and power-downs are dumb, but okay.

„Családi irkafirka”
Emlékszem általános iskolában a „sztárvársz” őrületben X szárnyú vadászokat rajzolgattunk a füzetbe meg „táj” vadászokat, majd ceruzánkat meglökve vonalakat húzva imitáltuk a lézerágyúk lövését és próbáltuk elpusztítatni az ellent. Valószínűleg a szerzőnek is hasonló gyermekkora volt és ezt öntötte formába ebben a játékban.
Adott egy pálya, rajta feladatok (célpontok) és nehezítések. Saját üres átlátszó „lapodra” rajzolva megpróbálod a feladatot időre teljesíteni, majd az eredeti küldetésre ráhelyezve azt lepontozni a művedet.
A koncepció jó, az egész családot mellé lehet ültetni és gyors fordulókban a különböző szinteket végrehajtani. ... és mindezt magyar nyelven (szabálykönyv – amúgy a játékelemek nem tartalmaznak szöveget).
Vidámak a rajzok, egyszerű feladatoktól nehezednek a küldetések. Összességében azt kapsz, amit vársz. Hogy ez kinek elég, már egyéntől függő. Nekem egynek jó, pár küldetés után önismétlés és ügyességi rajzgyakorlat. Bár a lézerágyúval jól bántam anno, itt simán béna vagyok.

Ok way to waste some time, but I wouldn't call it a game. Neat idea, but when it comes to the "power ups" and "bombs" it gets a bit to silly for my taste.

I think this concept for a game is absolutely delightful. Sure, it's unapologetically informed by party-style video games, but I don't see that as a bad thing. Being able to navigate a level better than your opponents is very satisfying and sabotaging them with additional restrictions is also amusing. I am a sucker for games that do something no other game does, and this one absolutely fits the bill. I'm not convinced of the longevity and replayability of Looney Quest, but as of now I absolutely want to play again.

Initial rating: 6.0 (July 2015)

What a surprising game, before playing it I didn’t even have heard from it. The game is very simple and can be explained under 2 minutes, its playtime is around 45 minutes.

The game components are very good as is the art. The theme is great and it is a very novel game for me.

In general I dislike drawing games, but this is one of the best I have played and all of us had fun playing it. Loony Quest is the first “drawing” game in which I’m good at :D.

Bottom line, a good and fun drawing game, I think I would want to play it from time to time, not sure about the replayability factor. Perhaps I will buy it. Great for the family.

Loony Quest is very fun, with an innovative concept that video-game lovers might appreciate. I rarely do the harder/higher levels, because every time I present it to new players we just do the first few. Despite the novelty effect of this game, its replayability is not that great - it becomes somewhat repetitive. The whiteboard pens offered with the box are really bad - I recommend you buy your own. A nice game for a quick laugh with friends and family, including kids.

What's the surest sign of a great family game? I gave this to my daughter for her 10th birthday and she is terrible at it. She has lost every game by a country mile, getting no more than a few points in each game. And yet, she is obsessed and wants to spend every minute playing the next level. I'm not sure if I've ever seen her this excited about a game in my life.

Loony Quest is an interesting amalgam of platform video game and board game. The base game comes with 7 worlds and 6 "levels" per world and two bonus levels that the different worlds share. A game consists of playing through all the levels of one world and takes about 30 minutes. The levels look like a screen shot from a platform game, with obstacles and point opportunities, along with a small menu that designates how to play and score the level. Players, with clear, white screens in front of them, have 30 seconds to draw per the objectives trying to hit or miss the various elements on the level, which you are looking at but not tracing over. Drawing objectives can be to draw a single path with a start and finish, circle certain elements entirely, draw dots as if shooting, and so on - hitting objectives and avoiding penalties. After the timer is up, players overlay their screens onto the level to see how well they did and score or lose points accordingly. Some bonuses can be inflicted on other players as penalties. Penalties might include balancing a token on the end of your pen or gripping it with your thumb and pinky.

The game is challenging, plays quick, and always seems to bring surprises and laughter to the table.

Definitely underrated but also such a different style of game it is bound to turn off some people. I think just about every game "collection" should have one of the quests but I do understand it's not a slam dunk winner for everyone. Still, such a good game to introduce people to the hobby and get them into something without "teams" which most party games use. Teams are great, but the limitation removes the majority of strategy games from consideration.

10! 10! 10! Fantastic! Dexterity - precision drawing, computer game-like. Extra fun with the special tokens, making even the same level unique every time you play it.
Innovative, brilliant, engaging, tons of fun! Cool artwork, high replayability, our children (3,5,6) can play it with simplified rules (no mosquitoes, 3yo can draw any line, and just got the points if he hits a target, 5yo can have an extra try after each round, if he is not satisfied with his results). But this game is so good, they do not even get angry, if they are scoring low. They just love to play it, and try new levels.
I strongly hope that there will be expansions!

I think doodle quest might be better aimed at the age group of people i want to play this with.

the plastic overlays are hard to clean using the brush; I mean they are still dirty.

If this was a find (not mass produced game) I would like this probably more because the gameplay is unusual.

Having said that it quickly becomes repetitive.

RATING: N/A
In the drawing game Loony Quest, players study challenging level cards, then try to replicate the outline to meet targets and avoid obstacles on their tracing sheets. Once finished, players place their sheets on top of the level card to see whether the drawings line up with the targets they meant to hit — or avoid. Largely inspired by video games, Loony Quest players discover various worlds, play with 3D and 2D levels, run into loony monsters — Loonies — and big bosses, trigger special stages, collect bonuses, use penalties on opponents, and gather as many Xperience points as possible to win.

A nice, colorful game of drawing movement lines on foils that are then placed on the drawing of the current scenario (based on the world of platform games) and you can see if you succeeded in collecting all the coins, shooting targets and avoiding dangers or not.

Okay, this game is novel, even though it does have its problems. Mainly: I'm too good at it. No, but really. It's a game that is strongly skill-based, and I have a good eye for proportion and rather good drawing skills. The game offers some ways to hinder better-skilled players and help those who are not so good at stuff like these but still, it's hard for my family to score even nearly as much as I do. (Also, components are not as durable as they should be.)
Still, it's an enjoyable pastime.

I think for what this is it's a great quick fun family game. The only real downside is the limited number of worlds which is 7. But the worlds can be played over again and still be fun you just know what to expect. Expansions, and fans, can always add more.

Such a fun game!  Upon reading about it, I wasn't too sure about the premise, but count me in as a fan after playing it.  Utilizes a different skill set that's not really seen in other games and there's natural tension and comedy that comes as each player lays their overlay over the world.  The powers and penalties throw in some nice twists to keep game varied.  Highly recommend for any collection!

This game is a pure delight. When I first opened the box, I balked at the amount of stuff and the length of the rules; for a family game, it looked like work. But I came back to it and read the rules again, and realized that most of it doesn't need to be presented up front.

My kiddo (age 8) and I rocked out two back-to-games in our first session, and had a blast. The first world introduces the core mechanics in a forgiving way, and the second is quite a bit harder -- but not more complicated to explain.

And the game is tricky! Charmingly so. I think it would be nuttier, and perhaps more fun, with a full table, but it's surprisingly good with two.

It is indeed very much like playing a 30-second platformer by drawing, complete with power-ups and bombs. In some games, those "let's make it wacky!" elements go too far, and overwhelm the core experience. But here they're partially under each player's control -- you draw the stuff that touches them -- and they feel like a savory garnish.

But while it's a drawing game, it's not a typical drawing game. It's not about who draws better, or who best conveys something through a drawing -- it's about making lines, circles, and dots under time pressure, in unique circumstances. And possibly while stiff-elbowed or balancing a counter on the back of your marker.

And man, are the components awesome. The markers and insert are even great, which I never expect!

So solid across the board. I'd break this out with a group of adults, too.

---

World 3 is quite a bit harder than Worlds 1 and 2, and World 4 is bananas. We're not ready for that level of precision yet!

This one was a surprise for me. At first, I though it was too silly. And it is. But it is also really fun. Having drawing skills is definitely not a necessity to play this game, but being able to mentally transport a picture to a blank board and keep all the proportions when you are trying to get the most experience points while avoiding traps that will either take away your points or just outright kill you is a really helpful skill to have here.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit. You have to draw a path through the level without being able to draw it on the card itself. It's simple but fun, especially as a family or gateway game. Everyone at the table was laughing throughout and had a good time. Maybe not the deepest game in the world, but definitely a good one.

This is a very very fun game... having to draw some lines in an empty canvas trying to make a path or drawing circles in the right place, all this with the pressure of time going by, to then put the canvas on top of a Arcade type world and see if we manage to score some points, avoid penalties and get some power-ups...

the game comes with 6 or 7 worlds that have various Levels to be completed, like an old Arcade Game...

Pro: immediate fun, little-to-zero rules, replayable (even if you know the level picture, you can have malus that prevent a perfect draw), excellent component quality; really shines with non-gamers

Con: the transparent plastic gets dirty quickly; not a fan of the scoring track; really shines with non-gamers [i]only[/i]

Maga az ötlet is már zseniális, a játék pedig rendkívül szórakoztató!! Ez tipikusan az a játék, ami mindenki gyűjteményében ott kell hogy legyen, hiszen tényleg mindenkinek szól. Itt egyértelműen a játék a fontos, nem a győzelem.
Részemről egyetlen nagyobb negatívum, hogy számomra nem okoz nagy kihívást, valamiért nagyon megy, pedig egyáltalán nincs kézügyességem. És bár másokon is nagyon jól szórakozom, azért mégiscsak saját magán tudna legjobban mulatni az ember. :)

Loony Quest ist ein aberwitziges, actionreiches Spiel für Zwischendurch, das es tatsächlich schafft ein Jump-N-Run Videospiel zu simulieren. Dazu gibt es etliche Level, die mit ganz unterschiedlichen Aufgaben versehen sind. Mall müssen die Spieler eifnach nur alle Goldmünzen sammeln, mal müssen bestimmte Dinge getroffen oder gefangen werden. Wie das funktioniert?! Jeder Spieler hat einedurchsichtige Folie und einen Folienstift vor sich liegen. Damit zeichnet er seinen Weg durch das Level, welches offen in der Mitte liegt. Ist die zeit abgelaufen, legen die Spieler reihum ihre Folie auf das Level und schauen, wie gut sie tatsächlich gezeichnet haben. Am Ende eines mehrteiligen Levels, wartet sogar ein Endgegner auf die Spieler, den man mit besonderen Aktionen erledigen muss. Looney Quest ist wirklich originell und spaßig, für Groß und Klein und für eine schnelle Runde Zwischendurch immer gern gesehen!

You see a picture and then have to draw on your own blank board a line to connect up object in the picture. Sounds simple, eh? Well it is....... at the start.... but as the game progresses the pictures become more complex.
Add in some handicaps if you make a mistake and some bonuses if you hit specific targets and this becomes a really tremendous party style game.

Hard to explain why this game is awesome. You're just drawing lines but it's more than that y'know.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Loony Quest is a light gaming experience in which the players are trapped inside a video game and as such the graphics and stage layouts look like side scrolling platformers and the like, which I find very appealing. 

The aim of the game is to respond to the requirements of each level, which usually involve drawing circles around stage objects, drawing lines to collect coins, and getting from one point to another by drawing a line without touching enemies or blocks. 

The trick is that all players can see the stage template but they have to do their drawing onto a laminate screen in front of them. Thus they have to estimate where they need to draw and once finished they place the overlay over the stage template to see how they did.

It's much more fun then it deserves to be but I think I need this in my collection. A full game requires completing various stages and scoring before ending with a boss battle. 

Cool idea.

Really silly and fun game. I'm pretty confident that I could introduce this to anyone and they would have fun with it. The artwork is off the charts, and the replay value is actually higher than I expected it to be. I think some of the bomb markers could be a bit more punishing, but this game is so light that I don't think that's a huge sticking point against it. Glad I picked this up.

UPDATE: Ended up getting rid of this. Surprisingly, I'm the only one I know who has played this and not gotten frustrated by it. So many people seem to obsess over doing well in this game, and not enough people treat it as just being a fun activity. Oh well...

Két világ lejátszása után. Baromi sokat vártam , hogy végre kipróbálhassuk, és ez is eljött. 4 játékossal egy hétköznap este jó szórakozás volt. Újszerű, sokat röhögős, könnyed játék. Egy bajom van vele, ami miatt nem 8 pontot adtam rá, hogy nem látom az újrajátszhatóságot benne. 2x vagy 3x élvezetes lehet végigvinni, de többször nem hinném, de cáfoljon meg a játék. Mindenesetre nagyon olcsón jutottam hozzá, ha ár- értek arányban pontoznék, biztos 9 lenne, de ettől elvonatkoztatva 7. Ami még fejlődhet felfelé.
-----
Nem fogom felpontozni. Bulin játszottunk vele, kellően ittasan, de itt is csak az első 1-2 világ szórakoztatott, igazán csak az 1. a 3. már unalmas volt. Bár ez betudható lehet a világnak is, nem tudom. Lényeg, hogy marad a 7 pont, de főleg a remek ötlet miatt, nem az újrajátszhatóság miatt.
-----
A 7 pont nálam jót jelent (bár ennél a játéknál az ötlet elismerése ad hozzá vagy 1,5 pontot) mégis ez a második ilyen játék amit eladtam. Jó lett volna végigvinni minden pályát, de jött az ötlet, jött a vevő, elment. Ez van. Nem tudta az érdeklődést 15 percnél tovább fenn tartani.

A more varied version of the domestic release Doodle Quest, with slightly more complex scoring and objectives. The game is unique, as it has players drawing on a transparency in hopes of creating a path through obstacles on a board. After the timed drawing sessions, players lay their transparencies on the board to see how they fared. A no-brainer purchase for those with children... fun for adults a few times as well.

Another spatial orientation game that should be easy enough to play. Believe it or not Looney quest has a theme! The theme is a video game of the early video gaming gere about avoiding penalties when coming into contact with the avoid drawing and maneuvering around the game "board" by eyeballing it. A game great for kid or the inebriated players alike as a party game. Loony Quest has lots of replay-ability.

What a hilarious, original game, at least when it's first introduced and for a couple of rounds. Playing 6 rounds at a time feels excessive, in the same way that 3/4 rounds of Galaxy Trucker feels excessive. Not enough variation arc-wise, emotionally, narratively to sustain that much.

Probamos este simpático juego casual de destreza en el que hay que dibujar en tiempo real sobre una hoja transparente propia un recorrido y luego superponerlo sobre el tablero para sumar (o restar) puntos conectando distintos lugares.

No necesariamente mi favorito, pero le reconozco que tiene sus méritos, principalmente, la calidad de las ilustraciones. Respecto de los componentes, tiene una pista de puntuación en el insert de la caja que intenta ser original pero resulta muy poco práctica y finalmente desistimos de usarla.

Respecto de la complejidad, me sorprendió la cantidad de pequeñas reglas que incluye. Si bien entiendo que le aportan variabilidad y rejugabilidad, creo que termina logrando que el juego no pueda ser encarado por chicos solos, sino que tiene que ser administrado por un adulto. Por mucha iconografía que le pongan, las excepciones y el texto van a dejar fuera a los menores de 8 años.

El juego escala bastante en dificultad con los distintos niveles de tableros (hay bastantes tableros y bastantes niveles). En ese sentido, va adquiriendo estrategia a medida que vas reconociendo que es muy difícil que vayas a conectar todos los objetivos y empezás a decidir por cuáles ir y cuáles dejar de lado.

En resumen, me sorprendió que por su complejidad y dificultad terminara resultando un juego para adultos. La propuesta y la presentación pueden resultar engañosas. Espero que no muchos padres se claven con la sorpresa.

Játék egyszerűen nagyszerű. 4 világot játszottunk végig hárman. A pontok a következőképp alakultak. World 1: 36-30-29 World 2: 30-27-23 World 3: 24-23-13 World 4: 15-14-9. Valóban egyre nehezebb a játék ahogy haladunk a játékban, a pontok jól mutatják ezt. 
Komponensek: (5-ös skálán) 4 pont (A filctollakon barkács munkát kellett végezni, a végéről el kellett távolítani a felesleges műanyagot, mert a szúnyoggal lehetetlen volt egyensúlyozni. Ez 4 tollat érintett az 5-ből.) 
Grafika: 5 pont. Ezen nincs mit nagyon részletezni, a grafika tökéletes.
Játékélmény: 4 pont. Mi jól szórakoztunk. A pályák kellően változatosak, hogy ne fulladjon unalomba a játék. Mikor az ember azt hiszi, hogy már nem tud újat mutatni a játék, mindig jön egy érdekes feladat, pálya. A szivatások közül a szunyog igencsak meg tudja nehezíteni ez ember dolgát, szinte kizárt, hogy teljesítsd a feladatokat. Az egy szemmel rajzolás valakinél megkönnyítette a játékot érdekes módon. Az ellenkező kézzel rajzolás sem okozott különösebb gondot. Viszont ha ez kombózott a szunyoggal, akkor lehetetlen volt bármit is csinálni. grin hangulatjel A banán amit oda lehet dobni a másik ember táblájára, nem sok vizet zavart. Hogy zavart okozzon nagyon jól és szerencsésen kell dobni. A szivatás mikor meg kell fordítani a táblát amin rajzolunk, nekem az segítség volt. Jobban be lehet határolni a dolgokat, mintha fehér alapon rajzolnánk. 
A 30 másodperces időlimit igencsak szűkös tud lenni, még szivatások nélkül is. Valamikor annyira belemerültünk a rajzolásba, hogy észre se vettük, hogy már lejárt az idő.
Kérdések is merültek fel bennem. Mi van akkor ha kifogy a filctoll? Honnan tudok pont ilyen tollat beszerezni? A szúnyog miatt nem mindegy milyen a vége. Mondjuk 3 év múlva is használhatók lesznek a filctollak? Nem száradnak ki?

Advanced 'drawing-skills' family/party game, perfect production, quality components. Original experience simulating 2D platform console/computer games (like Mario World from Nintendo). Fun to play, suitable for 8+, scales well for all players counts (2-5), best for 3+ players. Recommended !

19-06-2015. Rated after 2 plays. I dislike drawing, but this game makes it funny. You try to ASAP fulfil a task. This can be to draw a line from point A to B, without hitting obstacles. The twist, you are drawing w/o reference. 

Game works, is funny. I think it gets old soon.

This game is so awesome I had to order the Swiss version.  Hopefully they print an English version so more people can experience it's awesomeness.  Nice cross between Super Mario Brothers and Pictionary.  Pretty funny action and engaging for all players to see how other players are doing during the game.

Magyar szinten eléggé felülreprezentáltnak gondolom ezt a játékot.
Nagyon nagy az alapötlet, de mindent egybevetve biztosan nem kellene a gyűjteményembe a Firkaland. Egyszer-egyszer jó játszani vele, de úgy látom, hogy könnyen unalmassá (ismétlődővé) válhat.
A megvalósítása nagyon magasfokú, viszont kár lenne tagadni előbb, vagy utóbb elhasználódik, elkoszolódik a beltartalom.
A nehézségét, bár elméletileg könnyű skálázni, kifejezetten nagy kihívás jól beállítani. A könnyű pályákon mindenki tarol, a nehezeken meg elvétve születik pont. Igaz, felnőtekkel játszottam, de gyerekekkel biztos jó(bb) móka.

Pleasantly surprised by the whole idea and execution. Players simultaneously draw in real time their path though a platform video game time level, trying to hit good thing, avoiding bad things. Drawing skills not required (just spatial orientation), no learning curve, just immediate fun. 

Going through several levels, they do get tougher. And some players (like myself) developed interesting drawing styles, a.k.a. seismogram style. You're not drawing circles, you're drawing rectangles with weird amoeba pseudopods. 

I've played some levels repeatedly with different groups (from 3 to 10 players, yes, two boards combined) and it's not a problem. Even if it's a challenge you played before, it's still challenging. It is all about a certain skill, you might have or not, but if not, do use mosquitos on those other bastards.

Really a clever sketching game where you try to draw a path to score points and avoid obstacles, but you do it on a transparent board and then overlay the actual route to see how you've done. Certainly a novel mechanic and a fun filler.

RATING: 7
This game is just like Doodle Quest only much MUCH better.  Doodle quest is a game for kids.  It is overly easy and simplified and the theme and artwork are boring.  This game is for families.  There is no child who can play Doodle Quest that can't also play this.  There are a couple more rules and the "maps" are a little bit more challenging but when it comes to dexterity and spacial recognition children are just as capable if not more so than adults.  Plus the theme and artwork are a lot more fun and exciting.

If you aren't familiar with the game I am comparing this to the basic gist is that a piece of artwork is placed on the center of the table and a challenge is associated with it.  The challenges could be drawing a line from a start to an endpoint, drawing dots over enemies, etc.  Each player has a transparent plastic sheet and a marker and 30 seconds to draw lines, dots, etc. to complete the challenge on their sheet.  Then the sheet is placed over the artwork and see how they did.  There are extra points, obstacles that subtract points, and bonus and penalty markers on most of the artwork as well.

That's basically it.  The game goes for 6 rounds and the person with the most points at the end wins.  The bonus markers do things like let you cancel out obstacles or "attack" other players by throwing an object on their sheet they have to draw around or balance on the back of their pen for example.  The penalty tokens do things like make the player draw with their non dominant hand or with one eye closed for the next round.  These are things no adult is "better" at than a child making this a much more engaging game for a wider range of people.  I had fun and I'm sure children would too.  The only thing I could imagine making this a less "kid-friendly" game are the attack pieces for kids that don't like or can't handle confrontation.  If that's a concern though it is just as easy to take the attack bonus tokens out of the game prior to play.

I said in my comments for Doodle Quest that I thought it was a good, clever idea but I did not like the execution.  This is that same idea with much better execution, incredible family weight and fun game.  Even if I am personally god awful at it.

tl;dr: mediocre game but great fun

I quite enjoyed playing this silly romp, but to say that it is a great game would go too far. But not every game has to be great of course. Simply being good enough and fun sometimes is enough.
So this game takes kind of a video game platformer theme and combines it with drawing and spacial insight. Those things all work well for me. I didn't win, but that's besides the point.
So don't expect anything great, but if you like drawing in a fast and slightly silly game, give this a shot!

I played a pre-production copy of Loony Quest, but I could already see that it was a lot of fun. It also seemed to have more 'maps' than Doodle Quest and slightly more challenging maps at that. I also found the artwork more charming.

I'm not sure how replayable it will be, but this might well find its way into my collection when it is released

Update: Loony Quest has been well developed and very nicely produced. I'm still not sure there's a huge amount of replayability in the game so it's one that I'm definitely happy for other people to own.

Nem tökéletes játék, de nagyon ötletes. Az alkatrészek minőségét illetően vannak aggályaim, de majd meglátjuk... Tényleg addiktív, végig megvolt a csak-még-1-pályát! feeling. :-) Főleg kis (és kicsit nagyobb :-) ) gyerekeknek ajánlott, a kicsik sokkal jobbak vakrajzolásban, mint gondolnánk!

Eredeti ötlet, talán a Dominion-féle saját pakli újdonsággal összevethető. Ami miatt mégsem olyan nagy a pontszám, az hogy ebben nincs stratégia, nincsenek komoly döntések, van benne szerencse és az egész olyan "lightos". Figyelem: ügyességi játék!

Good fun, especially with kids. They asked for several more games after the first before they had enough. The worlds get progressively more difficult after the first one, offering quite a challenge from world four. One of the kids does not even like to play games in general, but this was right up her alley. The only drawback of the game is that the markers (and especially the brushes) are not of the best quality, and the sheets are difficult to clean completely after a few games. Still, definitely recommended, especially at the low retail price.

This one was something of an impulse buy when I realized it was hard to get ahold of and was pretty cheap on Amazon.co.uk. The basic premise of the game is you have a level that you need to get through and to do it you’re going to use a dry erase marker to draw on a transparency and then place that overtop the level. For every correct thing you do (collecting coins, hitting characters in those levels, drawing lines to the correct place), you earn points, but for every incorrect thing you do (hitting blocks, not dodging certain characters), you lose points.

I had fun with it, but I’m not wild about it. It felt like more of an activity with a score and it wasn’t nearly as funny as I had hoped. Then again, we didn’t use the timer, nor did we ever earn any penalties. I do want to try it again, and this time we’ll probably play arcade mode which forces a penalty on everyone and we might use the timer, even on levels that don’t call for it.

I loved the game when when through the lower worlds, I thought it was a really cool concept. But I am a lot less enthusiastic now after playing the upper worlds (even from world 3) as difficulty is just incredibly hard. It's challenging, but the fun factor takes a serious hit. My playgroup shared the experience, that it was too much of a struggle to get the drawings right and lost interest into the game. In too many levels many players would get 0 points. The bonus/bomb tokens are nice additions, but when you combine them with the extra difficulty they're just overkill. It's a good game, but it's also an irritating one.

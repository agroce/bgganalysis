Played this at the board game night I host at the Ballard Library in Seattle.  It is remarkably like Robo Rally - but with less cards and easier rules.  I came in second place, despite never playing it before (because I'm good at spacial awareness, and I've played Robo Rally so I wasn't a complete newbie to this type of game.)

Nice, cute, fun, simple and quick. Looks expensive for the weight of the game but the ducks are great.

Also note you can fill the ducks with water and squirt out of their mouths!

Not a bad Roborally-lite.  Less thinky (and a better length) than that game.  +1 point for the size of the tiles/ducks (even though the box is huge).  -1 point for the awful black-on-dark-green rules for the action chips.

RoboRally light in many respects. There isn't the same time pressure, or need to plan ahead as much. But that does also make the turns quicker and easier to resolve. I'd prefer RoboRally but I seem a bit better at the spatial visualisation than others.

RATING: 3
I like robo rally, so this should be a favourite too right? Wrong, hated it :(

Ducks are cute, theme is a bit weak (although robo rally's theme isn't exactly strong either - so that's not the real issue). Main problem is it is too chaotic (can't believe I'm saying that, its not like robo rally is a perfect plan type game either!), I was expecting a bit of chaos, but here you have so little control - the hand size and card type means you often can't go where you want to at all.

But worse is the lack of interaction, half the fun of roborally is messing up and through your mess up also messing up an opponent (pushing them onto a conveyor or down a pit etc) - here there is none of that, if you hit an opponent's ducky you just bounce off ... boring.

All in all, I just wanted it to end, didn't care who won, which is not a good sign at all :(

Saying that, some gamers will love it, and that's great - just not me.

Rating based on one play of basic game.  Cute little filler.  Extra half point for the adorable little ducks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Giving a rating after one play is always hard but in this case it's even harder. I basically like these games which are simple and can be played with anyone. Cute components work also nicely and with the right group this is going to be very fun game to play.

With six there's a slight downtime problem and game is really random. I felt that it was just a bit too random and it didn't enough difference which card you played because a) usually you didn't have the right card in your hand and b) you had no idea which number your opponents might be playing.

I'd like to play the game once more to see if there's more in it.

RoboRally for kids. Not nearly as much fun as it looks.

RATING: 7
A fun game.  A slightly simplified version of RoboRally - basically relies on the same programation mechanism, although in a more appealing package.  Of the two I think I prefer this one as it is light, fun, still asks you to think a little and is full of those chaotic fun moments I liked about RoboRally.  The theme is a real gem too - love the little duckies.

RATING: 10
A fun game similar to Roborally in basic concept. I found this more enjoyable however due to the sheer silliness of having rubber ducks. The random elements mean that its not easy to plot your moves and thats the point. It is meant to be fun just not competative fun.

It looks like a kids game but all my fellow adult gamers fell in love with it after just a few turns of the game and looks to be a regular at our meet ups for the foreseeable future.

It is the sort of game that can be pulled out almost anywhere (space permitting) and everyone will have fun with it.

Quicker, simpler alternative to Robo Rally where players program their duck's movement one turn at a time (as opposed to the 5 in Robo Rally).  This was fun to play with my 6 yr. old, though even with the basic game it took us a little while to get used to the movement.  By the end of the game, though, it felt much easier.  We really enjoyed our first play!
We have angel duck, army duck, vampire duck, and rock star guitar player duck.

This is my favorite of the programmed-move genre, I like it better than Roborally and Warhamster Rally which are too long for what they are.  This one is short, sweet, simple, and has great bits.  Fun to play with kids or as a light filler.
Disclosure:  I am friends with the designer but though I published one of his other games I have no financial stake in this one.

Okay game with very neat duck playing pieces.  Suffers from being too random as the nature of the game (it has shades of Robo Rally) means that sometimes it can really, really drag.  On and on and on.  Not a good thing for what feels like it should be a fairly light, quick game.

Why does everyone keep on comparing this game to Robo Rally? I find it more like a lighter version of Warhamster Rally. The card mechanic, board and play is nearly identical to Warhamster Rally with the only thing similar to Robo Rally being that the buoy's are like the way points that you have to touch.

RATING: 5
Apart from Space Alert, I don't think games with programmable actions are really my cup of tea. I don't care for either The Great Space Race or Roborally, both of which duck! duck! Go! is strongly reminiscent. I guess my biggest frustration with these kinds of games is that sometimes you simply can't get where you want to go because you're so limited by the cards in your hand. I'm not sure this is a fair criticism, since nearly every other board game puts restrictions on players' actions. But there's something about not being able to control where you go that just annoys me to no end. 

duck! duck! Go! also has an unfortunate tendency to bring out the AP in certain people. I've seen players spend several minutes trying to figure out where their ducks will end up and which way their they will face, especially if they bounce off of another duck or end their movement on a buoy. But if you're adept at visualizing spatial orientations, you're likely to feel frustrated and bored as a 10-minute game turns into half an hour or longer. 

Now, to be fair, duck! duck! Go! isn't a horrible game by any stretch of the imagination. The rubber ducks are a lot of fun to play with and move around, and the movement cards clearly show both your path to take and the directions your duck can face afterwards. However, there isn't much more to the game than "play a card and move a duck." And for all of the pretty components, having so little of a game behind it is rather disappointing.

The kids (big & small) love playing this, although I'm not sure if it's just because of the rubber duckies or because of the game itself. Fairly simple mechanics (although still had to help our 5 year old). The 7 year old picked it up quickly & enjoyed it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a weird one, because the rubber ducks would lead you to believe this is a child's game, but the programming, hex movement, blocking, and racing all make for a more complex game. That said, oddball children's theme aside, I didn't love it, especially as the "bonking" rules with ducks into the walls and each other made for some clunky game play at multiple points.

Duck! Duck! Go! feels like a much simpler, more constrained, and less fun version of Robo Rally.  The components are great and certainly appealed to my young kids, and they enjoyed the game alright.  But it can almost feel harder to get to one’s destination when the movement cards often take each duck several spaces down a constrained path that may not get me any closer to my goal. I don’t see myself bringing this out very often except to get out the duckies when my toddler wants some extra fun in the bathtub.  I was hoping this would be more of a family game, but I think for my family it will be just for the little kiddies.

I wonder what makes a human being design a game, supposedly for adults, with a theme of rubber ducks racing in a bathtub. And the worst is that it comes with real rubber ducks! OK, they are really a special touch, but if I introduced this game to certain friends, I would get weird looks. The game is very simple, with programmed movement via cards, and reasonably pleasant to play, but it has nothing special but the components.

I picked up because my youngest loved the rubber ducks.  I think the rulebook was poorly laid out.  Some parts of the rules are written in dark text on dark green back ground.  The bird dog rules could have used a few more sentances and the action tokens needed a bit clarification.  It's an 'ok' game.  I wish that you could actually 'bump' people and affect them.  Then it would be a good game.

First played March 26, 2009. Taught in a few minutes, played in about 30 minutes with 5 players. This game has more luck than skill in it. And I guess that's the way it should be since it's a light filler game. Each player picks a duck and is given three cards face down for their hand. Then each player is then given a card face up to determine start order.  Each player places a duck on a life perserver. The goal is to collect three cups and then make it to the drain first. Each player places a card face down as their movement card. The lowest number card goes first. On your turn you move those spaces depicted on the you card played. Card numbers range from 2 to 52. The smaller number moves less spaces and better direction and the larger numbers move more spaces, however have less power of direction. When you move, you move the direction you are facing and use the cards. If you were to run into another duck, you turn around and keep moving. If you run off the board, you turn around and your turn ends. You can also go onto a life perserver after getting at least one cup and place your duck in any direction from the same or any life perserver, however you turn ends then.

I've just bumped this from eight to nine after playing two ducks each for two players, as per advanced rules.

Lot's of comments around that this is "roborally lite" which is fair 'nuf. Also comments that you can't really mess with each other which is NOT a fair comment, and comments that you don't get the cards you want, which is kinda half the point... making good use of what you've got.

There's enough control to be satisfying, enough chaos to be interesting, and enough silly to be fun.

Very similar to Bumper Car Arena, or you can think of it as a simpler RoboRally. Try to play with the maximum number of players if you can - like those other two games, it loses more and more of its appeal, the fewer the players.

The rubber duckies are a great schtick.

RATING: 2
Very basic introduction to programmed movement style games that should be great for kids but wasn't for ours. The rubber duckie factor was enough to get our son interested to try it and even replay it though it was obvious it's the toy alone that interested him and not the gameplay.  You can get all the different ducks used in this game by the bucketful cheap from the same source the publisher used which is Oriental Trading.

For our just turning 8 year old son he had difficulty following the cards as did Grandma and even my wife at times.  There are 3 different arrows and two different colored hexes on every card.  Blue hex and purple arrow to orient your start position, red arrow to indicate changed facing over multiple white additional movement hexes and then finally several green arrows to choose final facing from.  How on earth is all that easier than just having a sequence of simple movements cards like in other programmed movement games (Forward, Back, Turn Left, Turn Right cards)? And hexes are inherently much harder to follow and orient for something like this instead of squares which nearly every other game uses (RoboRally, Mechs vs Minions, etc.)

Also the advanced rules are really needed to help mitigate situations where you just aren't getting the card you need to move.  It's really most fun to those who can see ahead at least one move to know to play this card so that the later one will actually accomplish what you needed.  Without that ability or desire to analyze it that way it'll often look like utter chaos and be very hard to hit your target at times. For children you will be basically choosing for them in many situations as seeing ahead "one move" in this game is basically needing to see ahead 8 or 9 moves or even more due to each card having 3-5 moves on it most if the time. By the time anyone is capable of playing fully by themselves it's more like why bother?

Then there are situations where two ducks get stuck together in a two space corner endlessly bouncing off of one another until one draws the one or two type of cards that lets you start by moving off to the side instead of dead straight.  The game mostly just ends up frustrating or dull. It failed as a children's intro to this type of game for us. The new 2016 version of RoboRally is a better choice as is my absolute favorite Mechs vs Minions (which is also a cooperative game which is perfect for introducing kids to a new game mechanic like programmed movement.). Both of those are also very enjoyable for adults as you add more rules.

REPLACED BY:  Mechs vs. Minions

The various different ducks are cute and collectible.  The game play reminds me of Autoscooter without the speed/acceleration and everyone ramming each other.  Feels more like a beer & pretzels racing game.  I much prefer Velo City and others.

RATING: 6
Consider this simplified Roborally.

LIKES:

* Rubber duckies are pretty cute - they make a very nice game component!
* Advanced game version adds a bit of flavor I would think - but the base game is fine and excellent for young kids!
* Modular board allows for a different board almost every time you play.

DISLIKES:

* Card draw can hurt you but I suppose it evens out in a longer race.
* Needs to play quickly as there isn't much else to think about during the game; otherwise it can feel quite slow.

A quacky bathtub racing game, with collectable rubber duckies. Good for a quick game or two, once in a while.

Lots of player interaction, but seems to get somewhat random, as to who actually wins (as a plus, it is usually down to the wire, who pulls out the victory in the end). This is not a game to be taken too seriously

Somewhat of a disappointment.  The idea is great and the rubber duckies offer an acceptable level of 'collectability'.  The mechanics just don't really exceed other programmed movement games like Roborally or Wings of War.  I'm hoping further play may change my mind.

Own version with 6 ducks and the birddog.

Why is everyone comparing this to Roborally?  In my opinion it doesn't really havea any comparison at all.  Every turn players select a movement card and execute it in descending order.  If you bump a duck or hit the edge you do a u-turn.  A very simple race game which has been much better executed in many other games.

I could see it work ok as a family game with children but it was rather boring for our group the first time thru.  We only played three players so I would expect it to be a bit more fun with more.  Still I was expecting something much better than this.

RATING: 7
Bought it as a RoboRally substitute for the kids, and it stayed for ... well, for the duckies. Nice preprogrammed race on a variable board. Somewhat confusing orienting on a hexagonal grid, but it's not big deal. Enjoyable, gets played occasionally, but somehow no one demands another round.

RATING: 6
A cute simultaneous action selection game where players each choose a card from their hand, reveal it and execute the action in order of who placed the lowest numbered card.  It's a race to collect all of the bouys in the tub and then reach the drain.  

Players also gain special power chits which do various things and there's a nice catch-up mechanism where the last place player gets to control the bird-dog... which is great at hindering other player's movement.  Additionally, there's warping through life-savers, some hand-management options and awesome components.  I ended up buying 3 of the ducks, found in the games, just to give to my son for bath time. 

Some comments mention this is more chaotic than RoboRally.  I disagree.  Rather than programming 5 moves a turn you just program 1.  It does have chaos since you don't know what other's are playing and there is some luck in the card draw but it's nothing out-of-control.

Awesome family fun game, and weighted perfectly to teach kids (I think, ours are still yet to be born)

We play with a hand of 4 instead of 3, to mitigate some of the random unluckyness of the card draw, but man is it a quick and fun game with a good amount of 'take that!' sprinkled in

RATING: 4
Roborally-lite, but so lite it's too random - in both gameplay and results. You play 1 card from a hand of 3, simultaneous revelation, which shows how your duck moves and where it ends. Move 'em. Repeat. If you're lucky enough to get good cards to steer your duck from 1 buoy to the next over the terrain-less pond without bumping into people, and hit the lead as a result, then you'll be mercilessly pummelled by the catch-the-leader mechanism - those coming last move the birddog which ejects you to the other side of the pond when they catch you with it. Meaning everyone catches up and then it's a random finish. It might be some fun for the kids on easy settings (no buoy bonuses, exit the birddog), but it's not a game I need or want to explore again in a grownup setting.

A kid friendly version of "Robo Rally" where cards are used to race your ducks around a tub and win by going down the drain. High production value with rubber ducks and the board pieces. With multiple board setups and around 100 ducks to add to the base game, there is a fair amount of replay-ability. Fun to play occasionally with an adult crowd, but best suited for families with younger kids.

Cute racing game that is more or less a kissing cousin to Hamster Rally, without the combat.

Simultaneous pre-programmed moves reveal puzzled out results.  Intentional interaction is low, unless you are the last place player, then you get to mess with people. The thing that makes this game work for me is that you get power chits that give you one of a number of special powers whenever you hit a buoy.  These can make for fun power moves to muscle your way through the chaos.

1 play, without the bird dog. DON'T PLAY WITHOUT THE BIRD DOG! It's a fun programmed movement race game that should play pretty quickly, unless you design a particularly difficult race course.

--- Summary ---
The board is constructed of several big hexes, each with smaller hexes of water and/or obstacles/targets. Start your duck on one of the starting buoys. Players have a hand of 3 cards which show movement paths (with specific duck facings at start/end of path). Everyone simultaneously selects and reveals a card; turns happen in numerical order on cards. If your duck bumps into the edge or another duck, it rotates 180 degrees and stops moving. The first time you land on or move over a target, take a token matching that target AND a special power token (which do a variety of things like allow additional movement, change cards, etc.). The player with the fewest tokens moves the Bird Dog after all other ducks have moved: any duck touched by the Bird Dog is teleported to a different location.

The first player to collect all tokens, then move to the drain wins the game.

The 10th game of 'Duck Duck Go!' to have been played, by my daughter, my wife and me, has to have been the most intense game, of 'Duck Duck Go!' that the three of us have played...or was it?! Well, at least my daughter seems to think so, and I guess so far it is, ha-ha! I guess having not played it for a short while it took a bit to get back into the swing of it maybe? :-P Having played all of the 'Beginner Boards' about 3 times each, it was decided, between the three of us, that things needed kicking up a notch so, we tried one of the 'Moderate Boards' of 'Duck Duck Go!' Have to say it's a winner for us! TRY IT! You'll probably enjoy this Game!! :-D

After playing Robo Rally, as nice as it is, for me I don't think I'd want to run it often due to its play length and complexity just pushing past simple. While Duck! Duck! Go! isn't exactly a programming game, I feel it's enough like a programming race game to capture the fun but simple enough to play quickly and be teachable to a broader variety of players. Plus come-on - rubber ducks! The theme is great, it can be chaotic without being too impossible (ducks just turn around) and there aren't too many moving parts.

I may look into getting another copy to expand the game area and get more ducks to increase the player-count.

I find it disturbing how difficult it is for some people to actually tell what the moving instructions on the cards actually indicate.

Simplified Roborally with cute little ducks. Possibly worth an 8.

I like this one quite a bit.  Fun theme, great bits, good mechanics.  Believe it or not, though, it is going to be tough for some kids to play this one.  The movement is easy enough, but it takes some spatial awareness to figure out the cards.

A fairly fun, light version of RoboRally. Would make for a great family game.

Second edition.  Complete and very good condition.  Played only a couple times.

The comparisons to Robo Rally are obvious though this one is easier to play. I never felt like the decisions were all that interesting and it's hard to develop any sort of long term strategy.

It seems similar in some ways to Robo Rally, but cleaner, more simple.

Great bits. You are trying to direct your rubber duckie around a "pond" by playing movement cards. Simple and easy to play for kids and adults. Buy this one.

Similar to Roborally, but not as good. Cute components, though.

Cute components.  Robo Rally-esque but simpler.  A decent little game.

It's kind of a semi-decent programmed movement introduction.  I would not waste time with the basic game as it is slow moving and can be dull.  Great intermediate game for younger kids.

Mindless, random, chaotic, no control. The ducks are cool, though.

Programa los movimientos de tu patito por la bañera para que pueda tocar todas las boyas y alcanzar el drenaje antes que los demás patitos.

All 4 players had a laugh. Game can't be all bad if it's fun.

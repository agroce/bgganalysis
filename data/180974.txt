RATING: 6.5
I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

This game got slowly but steady pretty hyped up in the last years. I certainly see some of the reasons why Potion Explosion could be appealing to a lot of people. 

For one thing it's really beautiful! The marbles, the artwork... everything is colorful and really eye-catchy. Also the basic concept, that clearly takes inspiration from game-apps , is going to be familiar for many and therefore automatically easy to grasp. Lastly the theme is also a strong point in its favor, that will draw a lot of people in. All these characteristics make Potion Explosion a great choice for a gateway/family game.

On the other hand, I wasn't enhammered with it as much as other people are. I didn't dislike it, but I didn't particularly like it either. I think the game works fine. It's easy to play, it's fast and it can be satisfying to cause a huge chain reaction and get a ton of marbles. Yet it does get a little repetitive after a while and I would probably enjoy it more, if the game was just a tad shorter.

Anyway, to sum up. I think that Potion Explosion is a beautiful game, that will get the attention of many non-gamers out there... and I think a lot of gamers will like it too as a filler. I like it too. I just don't love it. One thumb up!

Wel, i played two times this one and he instant remembers celphone games (aka Candy Crush - i hate this one). In gameplay the idea about make potins with variants powers is cool and works and the set collection too, but they all have different reward points and this sounds me like a race. A good game, but i don't have any will to play again

RATING: 6
1st play: Fun game if a bit light. The balls clacking down in bejeweled fashion is cool and the game is straightforward. I enjoyed myself playing this, but the game might be more setup than the weight/depth of the game needs to be. Also, there was a decent amount of downtime between turns. On further plays it might be faster to set-up and play, and then this game would make for a nice filler.

2nd play: Played again, with 2 this time and the game is better.  Turns are fun and the potions allow creative combos.  Unique explosion mechanic and good production.  Pleasant experience each time I've played.

This has been going over really well in the groups we have brought it out in.  A pretty light game that offers non gamers many opportunities to make interesting choices.

The novelty game is so much fun and I really enjoy playing with it, but... I'm not sure it's so good of a game? The strategy, tactics, and decisions are fairly thin. It's pretty much JUST the multiplayer puzzle of the marble tracks. Which is cool! But I wish they designed a bit more game around it.

The marble mechanic helps me get it to the table (people see the box and want to play), but it is a really simple game.  Some of the options, like drinking your potions, never really happened because people don't want to drag out the rule book.  It's cute and colorful, but not a gamer's game.

Potion Explosion is a simple, fun and fast paced game for all player abilities. In this game you will draw marbles to creat potions, and while drawing chain reactions or 'explosions' occur to give you more resources to build your potions. Drink your potion for special abilities to gain more marbles and ultimately more victory points.

Potion Explosion could be described as "Candy Crush: the Boardgame", but it's a bit more than that.
It is a wonderfully produced family game, with such great components (the "ball dispenser" is a very clever piece of design), quick playing time and a little bit of luck and take-that.
Combos and chain explosions are possible, and are the core of the fun.
I don't know if it has great replayability for hardcore gamers, but it definitely should for kids and the casual crowd.
Looking forward to play it again...

Zeer mooi spel voor lagere schoolkinderen.
Je laat explosies gebeuren door het wegnemen van een knikker, waardoor je veel extra knikkers kan nemen.  Hiermee vul je jouw flesjes toverdrank.
Je kan deze dan drinken om extra krachten te krijgen.
Je verzamelt punten door de flesjes te vullen, en 3 keer hetzelfde flesje te hebben of 5 verschillende.
Mooi gemaakt, maar relatief duur (34 eur op Zomerspel).  Ik wacht nog even om dit 2e hands te vinden.

Light strategy but there's something satisfying in seeing 'Bejeweled' comes to life. Hefty box with a lot of components and nothing can be as fancy as the DIY marble dispenser that seems quite sturdy itself. Good game to appeal to non-gamers but entertaining enough for gamers not to feel bored as well. Plays fast as well, so it's an excellent game to pull out when rushing for time!

Its board game implementation of Candy Crush is beautiful to look at and fun to use, but I'm not convinced this moves all the way from gimmick to good gaming experience.

"Bejeweled Blitz or Candy Crush" the board game.  Players select ingredients (marbles) from a cool apparatus and if the marbles coming together are of the same color they cause an explosion meaning you get to take them as well as you strive to complete potion cards which then give you special abilities to select or place ingredients.

A pleasant, though very light, game of pattern recognition. The game is fairly luck based (how the marbles end up in the rows) but does tend to reward the most clever use of potions and "help tokens".

RATING: 4
Very random boring exercise of taking marbles. The good thing about the game and the main gimmick is the marble dispenser. I guess the game was modelled to have a game including this thing. The game itself is a succession of simplistic decisions, which may or may not lead to great turns of the person after you. It is very random and you cannot plan ahead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game has been likened to "candy crush, the board game", which is mostly accurate. In this game, you have a bunch of colored marbles in a slide kind of contraption to make a number of columns. On your turn, you may take one marble from its column, and if by doing so, marbles of the same color clash into each other, you take those as well. You then use these marbles, or ingredients, to fill potions that you have and craft them. Some potions take more marbles and are then worth more points. Also, each potion can be used a single time, once crafted, to give a special ability to your turn.

It is very intriguing, albeit a bit lucky. It is also very satisfying to get big chains of marbles and you can sometimes grab 6+ marbles in one turn. This one is quite fun and definitely has a good toy factor to it. Easy rules make it perfectly gateway to me as well and the sliding marbles may intrigue some non-gamers where something like catan would be a hard sell.

Mainly played it on mobile app. The box version is stunning. Very good quality components and beautiful art. That being said I prefer to play mobile version. It's like it was designed for it. The game itself is simple in mechanic. Collect marbles that explode when colliding and prepare potions from them. The strategy part is in planning when to use potions and what potions prepare next. All in all the game is fun but a lot depends no random marble placement. As mentioned above I find it a fine game to play in the meantime on mobile device.

Simple pattern collection using the chaining mechanic found in the digital marble games from years past. It's an easy efficiency puzzle with a streak of luck thrown in. Combined with a bit of push your luck and those are the ingredients (pun intended) for a perfectly capable gateway game.

The vibrant marbles, the tactile feel, the clicking of the glass beads are all very appealing. Certainly not a gamer's game, but pretty solid as a family game.

Ok game with some unique components that blend well together. 
Definitely leans towards the anticipatory gamer with hints of AP and marble management. Overall, a really neat design and artistically attractive. This is a tactile hurricane of family fun.

Besides the minimal player interaction, my only critique would be that the game itself was too random. There was just several instances in which available marbles or potions led to stark contrasts in scoring and whenever you fall behind, you couldn't really catch up by game's end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A neat game with one of the more interesting components I've seen in tabletop gaming (the ingredient box where marbles roll down for you to collect and complete your potion brews). The strategy is of a reasonable level to play with kids and with regular game groups of adults, and the game does not last too long with 2-3 players. The sole mechanic of collecting marbles from the ingredient box may wear thin after multiple plays, but this is still definitely enjoyable to try.

Fun, relatively light Candy-crush sequel game of collecting potion ingredients and brewing potions. The production quality is excellent, and plucking marbles to chain explosions is very satisfying. Nicely, the game doesn't dilute this central theme with unnecessary mechanics.

For a game of this ilk, this one has surprised me. Yes, I'm a sucker for a fun theme and great components, and while the marbles aren't amazing, the other bits are stellar. This game is great fun. Collection games do tend to go over well with my wife, so this one gets points for that, but I also find it more interesting than something like Splendor. It isn't an engine, but if I want that I don't want a Splendor weight game anyways. The chaos and combos are a blast. I like this one, give it a spin.

Edit: Slipped slightly for me, wife still loves it.

Great family game that scale very well with both number of players and its ages. Not too difficult but non too simple and boring.

haven't played yet but has a very simple concept of picking up marbles that then group together to get more of that same color then using them to fill your potions for special effects

RATING: 7
This is not my kind of game - too abstract - and I would rate it much lower if it wasn't for the great and unique game mechanism: using marbles for ingredients and allowing them to explode in order to add them to your potion. A stroke of genius! Well done.

A fancy set collection game that uses a marble tray to collect your sets of marbles. The trick is to remove a marble and trigger an explosion by two other marbles coming together and then you get those marbles too to complete your potions. By completing a potion you get a one-time use ability and if you complete 3 of the same potion you get an achievement which is what pushes the end game. With 4 this went on a bit too long for me because the marble tray changes so much on a turn it is hard to plan and then you get locked in some AP at the start of your turn. There are so many other great set collection games like Century, Barenpark, Splendor, Sagrada, and Azul that are about this same depth and playtime that I would rather play any of those before this. Would I play it again if someone suggested it sure, but not one to add to my collection.

A clever take on the old piece-matching puzzle videogame formula, that transitions well to tabletop form, thanks to the wonderful components. There is plenty of tactical variety in the potion types, and each has different (but similar) formulas of different strengths/points. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this one, and can recommend it highly.

Fun little game that's a great introduction to the hobby for non-gamers thanks to its showiness. It's just so darn cute! Put this out on a table and watch people come over to, "Ooh!" and, "Aah!" at the pretty potions and marble housing. But there's some strategy in here, too, thanks to the powers of the various potions you collect. Does suffer from "analysis paralysis," so be careful about playing with people who need to micromanage every little detail of every turn - others are surely to get impatient.

An enjoyable Game that I can play with my kids as well.
They love it.  And although I play a bit more leisurely then Competitive with them, it's still fun making the potions and drinking them.
As well as the chain explosions of the ingredients. 

I usually us less reward points for shorter games with them.

All this makes it a games we are willing to play whenever it's suggested.

Quite fun. Puzzle solving (optimizing) and kinda engine building. It's much more than Bejeweled or Candy Crush the board game. I liken it to a slightly lighter version of Splendor combined with Candy Crush. Try the app first, and you will know if you want the cardboard and marble version.

RATING: 4
15 minutes of Candy Crush / Bejeweled fun stretched to 45 minutes of playing time. Too tactical (but that is a complaint I can also level at the parent video game(s)), and way too swingy once people start abusing the retort which allows stealing each other's marbles. And even that ends at some point because the flasks with that option run out. Kudos for the neat marble chutes, though.... But read the resulting note as '3' for the game, and a 'plus' for physical execution. The game itself is not improved one iota by the chutes!

Setting up spatial (albeit 1D) chain-reactions with special powers - that you earned by setting up chain-reactions! - is awesome. There's some pressure towards AP, though, and not much to do during others' turns - you can do some planning on the turn of the player before you, but things can change so much that lookahead further out feels a bit futile. I've only played 3p; and don't think I'd want to try 4p.

A good game to bring in those folks who are a fan of puzzles and mobile games alike. Not so easy that it becomes boring but not so complicated that it isn't easy to get people into the game within a few minutes. Plus who doesn't love a marble contraption. It is a crowd pleaser and easy to get people intrigued with that alone.

Bought this on a whim, hoping the Bejeweled-type mechanic married to other popular design elements would work.

Serious QC issues going on there. =(

I thought I would like this more but it has some drawbacks for me: seems to have a bit of a runaway leader problem, several times we ended up with a column that was heavily two colors and we'd keep draining it, setup time was a bit long, "shuffling" the potions at the start was a bit tedious - would have preferred rectangular cards, rules were a bit loose/the manual was a bit vague in places.

The core marble mechanism is fun and well-implemented.   However, the rest of the game behind it is pretty lackluster.   Gather resources, collect sets, convert to points, with a few special abilities.   It has been done many, many times before, and there is nothing special about the way it is handled here.   The marble mechanic might be enough to carry the game anyway, I just wish there was more of a game behind it.

RATING: 8
The bejeweled gimmick has guaranteed that this game has become one of my most played games.  But beyond that I love puzzle behind the game.  Trying to figure out the most efficient way to combine my standard move, drinking potions, and taking help from the professor is extremely appealing to me.  So much so that I've actually helped other players take more efficient turns (If they're okay with it) just to see the puzzle play out.

Thoroughly gimmicky, but worthy of at least one play. The marble dispenser and 'explosion' mechanism definitely draw players in, but the lack of strategic substance fails to fully capitalize. The potion powers are fun, and give players the option to pursue points or power, but its too difficult to make large chain reactions, and even if players manage to make one, most of the ingredients will be lost due to lack of storage space and the inability to draw and complete a potion in one swing.

Dear students, it's time for the final exams of the Potions class! The rules are always the same: Take an ingredient marble from the dispenser and watch the others fall. If you connect marbles of the same color, they explode and you can take them, too! Complete your potions using the marbles you collect, and drink them to unleash their magical power. Remember, though, that to win the Student of the Year award, being quick won't be enough: you'll also need to brew the most valuable potions in Potion Explosion!

A particularly-light puzzle game where players are trying to complete as many potions as possible before the game is over. The game utilizes a similar mechanic to Candy Crush or the original orb-destroying mobile game "zuma". Players take turn removing a single marble from one of the five rows or marbles. Then, if two same-colored marbles touch one another, the player can remove those as well. This can cause massive chain-reactions from which players use the marbles to complete potions that require marbles of that color.

There's enough strategy here that casual players will have a good time, and those more tactically-inclined will still enjoy themselves. The game is simple, but lighthearted. There is only a single take-that mechanic that can be removed from the game if your group so desires.

Fun game where you are trying to create explosions and collect as many resources as possible to complete your potions.

Easy to play but there is quite a lot to think about once you have some potions to help aid you and manipulate the dispenser. This game can have AP for some people and the downtime between turns can get a bit long with 4p

First game took me ~1.5h with 4p, the others in the group usually only play up to light-med games. Not bad but I'd probably stick to 3p in the future to cut down on the time in between turns and keep this at a 1h game.

Couple issues, though. 1. The marbles are really cheap. They vary in size, color, and quality in a bad way --some aren't even complete. Also the individual chutes can make the game less dynamic as you often find a move that depletes the display, forcing those marbles to go back into the same column. I think it would work better if the hidden area were a bit larger, and the displayed area a bit smaller, or an alternate method for filling the rows from a common pool. Finally, in 3/4 p, it has the classic issue of possible downtime (depends on the players of course), when you often can't make your move until you see the board configuration. Still, the complaints are minor in my book. Overall, a nice implementation and solid light family game.

Surprised that gameplay involves some quality decisions.  I thought it might be very easy and play itself honestly but while you do get to make a lot of potions, ap will happen momentarily(a good thing here) and turns can have some tough decisions.  Doesn't outstay its welcome and fun to handle and play.  Didn't think I would like but glad we tried it.

Good idea, simple and accessible (in a good way).

The "turn the potions to use special effects" are a bit too complex for this game though.  It feels like the basic game design is too simple to implement a "effect/exception-to-the-rules" type mechanic.  It detracts from the main mechanic, and feels "cheaty" to non-gamers.

I've used the word simple a few times, and it's the good kind of simple.  Gameplay wise it's simple, but it has a surprising amount of tactical depth,   Even if it doesn't look like it.

This game captures the feeling of a mobile game like candy crush or bejeweled and puts a cool theme, and some clean mechanics with it.

After playing many different attempts to recreate a match-3 videogame in an analog format, they finally did it! The box is cleverly made and the use of real marbles makes the pieces as weighty and clicky as they deserve to be. The tactile aspect is a big part of why I enjoyed it so much.

Gameplay itself is very solid as well. You collect ingredients to finish potions, which you can then use to help yourself and interfere with your opponents.

Possibly the best effort at making a tabletop version of candy crush crushy like games. Fun and different, it asks for observation skills of a different nature than most board games, which makes it great to introduce to those less enthusiastic friends.
The game does seem to have the risk of a slightly runaway leader thanks to the potions, but my experience might not have been typical.
Seems great with 3-4 players, and probably ok with 2.

Just a mediocre game designed around a gimmick. There is room for some clever moves, but there is a lot of luck in how the marbles align. I doubt it's worth more than a few plays, until the novelty wears off. The four colors of marbles come in three very different types: blue is solid and black has a strange oily shine, while red and yellow are annoyingly transparent (at least in the copy I played), to the point of causing a bit of confusion sometimes.

Es un euro muy sencillito y visual, en el que el objetivo de los jugadores es conseguir crear mas y mejores pociones, completandolas con ingredientes (representados con canicas) cogidos de un dispensario que las mantiene organizadas en una cuadricula, la cual funciona un poco al estilo de juegos como bejeweled o candy crush XD

es original, es divertido, es bastante sencillo de jugar y asi todo aun siendo sencillo, tiene su nivel de complejidad.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2016)

Before playing it, I haven’t even heard of it but when I saw it was from Cool Mini or Not I knew the game was going to be bad for me.

The rules are pretty easy, you can explain them under 8 minutes. The game components are VERY good. The art is great. My SO made a lot of remarks about how great the game looks on the table. The marble dispenser works well, but it is a bit flimsy.

The main mechanism (rolling marbles) is novel and I haven’t seen it in other boardgames but (sadly) the decisions are pretty obvious. Downtime is very high for such a simple game. When it’s not your turn you don’t have anything to think because the game situation will (likely) have changed a lot when it is your turn, so perhaps it is best with 2 players. In this configuration the decisions become a bit more meaningful. 

Potion Explosion has a high luck factor (with the marbles and potions) and there is not a lot you can do to mitigate it. It has a low replay value and its playtime is way too long for what it offers.

I also feel there is an issue with how the refill process works. When there is a huge explosion, most marbles will come back to the same column they were initially, so it is very likely the next player will get a huge explosion as well.

Bottom line, as is usual from Cool Mini or Not, the game looks gorgeous, but there is not enough meat in it. It has obvious decisions (nine out of ten times you are looking for the biggest explosion) and a high downtime (relative to the game weight). I think it can be a good family game, but it is way too simple for us. At first you are super excited to play it, but it becomes repetitive and boring rather quickly. I will try to stay away from it.

I've played a few games now with the "Candy Crush" style manipulation, grouping, and elimination and none of them have been hits with me. It might be something I enjoy in an app, but not in a board game. The heart of Potion Explosion is a marble rack where you pour marbles onto a slanted platform. They roll into slots that turn into rows from which you can remove a marble and have the remainder crash together. If the same colors crash together you can remove those as well, which can potentially create a chain of removals - all in the same row. These are added to two potions on your workbench that have different color requirements. Completed potions are kept for points and also give you a one-time ability. When completing a potion you grab another off the top of one of five stacks. And that's it! Take marbles, complete potions, take more potions. Used marbles are poured back into the marble rack. 

The novelty wears off fast and starts to resemble tedium, churning through potion after potion. I simply did not find this to be a fun game. It's not that I don't like simple games, I just feel that there is not enough variety or arc to this game to make it worth playing. You are doing the exact same thing at the end as at the beginning and the only reason the game ends is because - at long last - the potions will run out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The fun in this game doesn’t come from causing chain reactions in its unique marble dispenser (though that does happen and it is satisfying). The fun is derived from strategically using the potions made of those marbles to prolong your turn as much as possible. The downtime between turns can drag a bit, challenging the patience/attention spans of fidgety kids. Still, Potion Explosion is a reliable hit with my 7 and 10 year-old daughters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
The components look cool, but in practice is super fiddly... Balls sometimes don't fall, and it's hard to undo a mistake/mishandling. The game itself is quite boring too, just collecting matching gems over and over again... lots of luck too

RATING: 4
[floatleft][ImageID=2630294][/floatleft]This turned out to be a very repetitive game that was so boring we had to stop after a few rounds. I was hoping for a lot more fun from this game. There also seemed to be a problem with the way the dispenser refills. If you take a lot of marbles from one column on your turn then use them to brew potions (which you often do) then those same marbles get returned to the column they came from. Therefore columns that randomly have fewer colours will tend to remain that way since explosions are more productive in these columns and the marbles will come right back again. The whole marble display is a lot less dynamic because of this.

[center][ImageID=2701479 medium][/center]

It is fun to pick a marble and cause the explosions, but that quickly wears off and then you realize you're suffering through an incredibly dull and boring game. Stay away, you've been warned!

Oh man, what a good old fashioned FUN game this is!  That marble dispenser is such a fun thing to use.  At its heart, this may just appear to be some sort of match-3 set collection game.  But as you play and see that maybe little engines can be built and combos can be teased out, you can't help but just chase the prospect of having a big combo-filled turn!  

An exceptional family game that I think any collection should have.  This will identify easily with all family members.

2018-01-07 - 6.5 - Nice logic game, which reminds those match-three mobile phone games. The marble tray is pretty nice and is not just a gimmick, but a requirement for the main mechanisms of the game to work. I didn't like the end game trigger too much, which (either of them) looks like just someone says "all right, we had enough", while the gameplay remains pretty the same, no matter if it's the beggining of the game or the end. Nevertheless, I could gladly play it again, although I wonder if after more plays it doesn't get too repetitive.

Love the marble mechanism, but so-so on the set collecting.  Nothing new, but can make turns ridiculous with potion powers.  If you plan according, you can really keep cycling out a potion if you choose the right powers [sometimes 2 at a time, if you plan it right!]

Fun game. I will admit, the novelty of the marbles does add to it. 
I enjoy puzzles, so it's fun figuring out how to combine powers and make big explosions. Also, it's fun pushing your luck, hoping there is a marble of the correct color hidden at the top of the row you chose to take a marble from. 
That said, it is quite luck dependent, and can be pretty frustrating when another player gets all of the high-point potions.

Fun, very easy to pick up. It's extremely chaotic, and it's far too easy to stack up ridiculous chains with barely any strategic foresight. (I'm not being salty; I felt guilty during my last two plays because of the sheer amount of points I was getting per turn, without even trying) As a result, I feel that there are some balance issues. The game careens a bit out of control.

That being said, the game has some inherent charm, and it's an enjoyable diversion that has its place in my collection.

Finally got to play this great experiment by Cool Mini or Not at a local brewery meetup. I've yet to play a game by this publisher that I did not love.  As per typical CMON, the components are top notch. The game has a candy crush feel to it, and thats a good thing. This game has to have the most "app" feel to it of any board game I have yet to experience. A interesting set collection game with special powers and a kinetic component. The most rewarding aspect of this game is the sound the marbles make rolling into their slots, love it!

I really wanted to like this piece. It's seemingly simple game with refreshingly different components, but unfortunately you are still required to supply a game along with the components. Potion Explosion has quite strong luck factor which is very hard to mitigate. You pick ingredients, you use them to concoct potions, and once completed, they can be drunk for one shot effects. Potions grant points similar to green cards in 7 wonders, craft same or craft different, but craft many. Would play again, but wouldn't be thrilled about it.

What a great strategic marble collecting game.  A great blend of set collection, special powers from potions, and marble picking fun.  There's a lot of strategic decisions on when to ask for the professor's help or combo potions.  Fantastic game for the entire family.

Now we are talking! Excellent produced (after you've updated the Dispenser from the very first edition to the fixed edition which one you'll get for free) 'Candy Crush' game which is fun and fast to play. High quality components works nicely and after you print player-aids for different potions, then the game runs smoothly. Yes, Potion Explosion is lightweight game and there is quite high luck factor as well, but when you take it that way it just works!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a solid puzzle game with some aspects of candy crush in that you collect marbles of the same color that crash together in your action. There are some really interesting moves that can be made between using "help," completed potion abilities, and just your regular action. The marble contraption/mechanic is fun if overproduced and sometimes hard to put together.

First play was tonight and I was not disappointed.  Watching matching marbles collide together on the track is cool touch, which, as many have pointed out, is like a real version of Candy Crush playing out in front of you.  I did find one drawback to the game.  Don't expect the potion explosions (new collisions of same-colored marbles) to happen regularly.  We went several turns where we were essentially drawing one marble at a time without any cool effect afterward.  This is just how the marbles fall when you drop them into the dispenser.  In those moments, it felt like we were just plucking and placing colors, then you go, then I go, etc.  Nevertheless, I really did enjoy the game and will happily play again.  

I do have to mention two other things about this game.  One, the box says ages 14 and up.  No way.  You explain this to an 8-year old and they'll get it no worries.  Some of the portion abilities are difficult to remember but there's a key in the instructions.  Two, how it was designed to put everything back in the insert was ingenious.  There are A LOT of punched-out pieces in this game.  I was sitting there wondering how it all goes back.  Not only does it all fit, it fits comfortably and organized.

So, I was first interested in this for how they used marbles and how it was a unique board gaming experience. I was expecting more of a gimmicky game without much depth, and how wrong was I! It's much more strategic than I had expected (which was surely an enormously pleasant surprise), and it's plenty of fun. Some people say it's the board game version of Candy Crush, but they're wrong. It's actually more like Zuma. The components are also pretty nice. The marbles look nice, and everything else is made of sturdy cardboard. It's by no means a heavy game, but it does allow some interesting potion combos for maximizing ingredient income. You'll definitely find some good depth here.

I had a hard time figuring out why I would ever play this when video games like Puzzle Quest exist.  Conclusion: I wouldn't.The game is reasonable enough - the formula is well trod, the presentation is nice, and the novelty of having this kind of puzzle game in board from is fine - but the main draw to a simple matching game for me is that it can be turned off.  The player interaction is not real: sometimes bad things happen to you as a result of it being the best thing for your friend to do to help themselves.  This actually feels bad because your fate is out of your hands.  Puzzle Quest overcomes this by grafting a battle game onto the matching, but Potion Explosion is a points race. All this to say, I think the game lasts too long.  I think any length of time for this game is too long.

This game kind of reminds me of one of those "Bejeweled" games that I played on my phone in the past. You are trying to chain combinations of marbles together in order to complete potions (orders) each round. Completing the potions gives you points, helps trigger the end of the game, and also gives you one time use abilities. I really enjoy this game, and play it rather frequently.

So far – loving it.

The "ball dispenser" – though plagued by a production error in the first print, which was repaired by giving customers of the first ecdition a separate punchboard with corrected parts - is a great component and more than a gimmick. The potion flask illustrations look pretty amazing, the rules are easy to grasp, some minor Analysis Paralysis may kick in (due to the combination of potion effects), but all in all a great family game. The help of the professor is a clever addition compared to the prototype (ignore it and you will most likely lose).

Original game. Making potions by taking out a marble from a row. If because of that, two other marbles of the same colour hit each other, a potion explosion comes into action, allowing you to take all marbles involved in that explosion. Smartly done, very original. Finished potions allow for certain special actions to become available for one time use, speeding up your next brewing.

☖ Jugado en Sant Andreu de la Barca con David.

✔ Mantiene la marca personal de este sello de creadores italianos conocido como Horrible Games (cuyos juegos no son para nada horribles). Como en Steam Park, hay bonus y malus, elementos muy frescos en la mecánica y un tema divertido y... cuando parece que todo esto se puede descontrolar de alguna manera, miras las puntuaciones finales de la partida y están ajustadísimas (entonces gritas: "¡es un eurogame!").
✔ Un "set collection" sencillo y familiar que gira en torno a un artefacto lúdico muy original: el dispensador de canicas (del mismo modo que Camel Up es un juego de carreras sencillo y familiar que se apoya en otro artefacto lúdico original: la pirámide de dados).
✔ El tema y el arte están bien elegidos. Los componentes desplegados sobre la mesa hacen que el juego llame mucho (quizá hasta demasiado) la atención.
✔ Encantará a Celia Villalobos y a otros viciados del Candy Crush Saga (que por cierto, todos esos juegos de enlazar elementos para que desaparezcan no dejan de ser una mera copia del clásico de SEGA Columns -¡del 1990!-, ya tocaría ir innovando, ¿no?)

✘ Detrás de todo el "maquillaje" espectacular, el juego en sí no te sacude. Dudaría de su factor de rejugabilidad. Quizá es mejor considerarlo un divertimento más que un juego al uso.
✘ Es un juego hecho a medida para jugadores con buena percepción visual y reconocimiento de patrones. Si todos en la mesa comparten el mismo nivel en esas habilidades estará compensado, si no... puede ser frustrante.
✘ Las pociones otorgan puntos en función de su dificultad a la hora de completarlas... realmente (jugando a 2 jugadores) no he acabado notando que unas cuesten más que otras. Quizá a cuatro jugadores los colores en el dispensador van más justos y los retos son más difíciles (y por ello más motivadores)... pero esto denota un posible fallo de escalabilidad.
✘ Otra cosa que no me gusta es que en el reglamento se especifique/sugiera que los jugadores pueden modular la duración de las partidas a su antojo (añadiendo o quitando fichas de maestría). Lo veo poco elegante.

Nota numérica en BGG: ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆
Nota verbal en BGG: OK - lo jugaría si estoy de humor

Potion Explosion takes the best part of Bejewelled, the arcade game, and turns it into a marble filled boardgame. Players remove a single marble every turn, trying to combo connections that "explode" and give them extra marbles.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/ETkSgd13Ic0

Potion Explosion has been dubbed the 'candy crush' of board games. In it you will pluck marbles (or ingredients) from a clever dispenser to complete potions. Completed potions give you powers and points and that's sort of it. 

The powers are well balanced for the game though and you want to try and complete at least one potion every turn. The tactile nature of the game combined with the simplicity and table presence make for a winner in my book!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not much to do until it's your turn, but once it is, the board feels like a field of opportunity as players agonize how best to collect as many marbles as possible in a classic feeling puzzle game fashion. Fairly easy rules, but slightly cumbersome setup if two types of potions are removed pre-game, as recommended by the manual. Worth experiencing.

This game grew on me after a while. The first time I played it I thought it was beautiful, but nothing more. 

Then I changed my mind. And the reason why I did is that I find this game extremely relaxing. The theme, the component, the fast setup, the combos and the little puzzle nature of this game make it an excellent easy-going game, for those moments when one just wants to enjoy the experience. 

Great!

The marbles are a neat gimmick, and I have to admit that I'm drawn in by it. I'm not sure if it will hold up over multiple plays, but I like the recipe fulfillment with the marbles.

Played once.
In my first play I couldn't wrap my head around how to use completed potions, or why I'd even want to.  The marbles are novel enough, but I don't know if it hangs together well enough as a game - and not sure I need to find out.

RATING: 7
Played once with my wife and daughter - a fun, light game. The core mechanic involves a contraption with rows of marbles that roll down. You're trying to collect marbles of various colors as ingredients for potions. When you pick a marble, if two or more other marbles of the same color collide, you get those marbles too, and those reactions can chain - feels kind of like a mobile puzzle game. I think we'd happily play it again but didn't quite feel compelled to buy it outright.

RATING: 5.5
A bit more tactical than I'd like and the marbles can break (one was broken) and a bit luck based but fun in the sense it reminds me of a cell phone game I played as a kid of gem crashing. The components are top notch too, as expected of CMON.

Excellent family weight game. I'm not sure who marked the box that the age limit is 14+ because that is way off. A 7-8 year old could easily grasp this. I'm able to play a dumbed down version without the potion abilities with my 3.5 and 6 year old. Great game!

The marble sorter is pretty rickety and needs to be on a dead flat surface, or the marbles stack up on one side and not all the rows fill up evenly. There’s generally a pretty obvious best choice, so not a great deal of strategy. It’s a fun concept, just could’ve been executed a little better perhaps.

Nice production, although I'm not very fun of the art it displays.

Cool mechanisms that mimick some puzzle videogames, but the fun part comes with the powers acquired when completing potions, that open a vast array of possibilities. And there comes too the only issue with Potion Explotion: the long waiting time between turns for such a light game.

In any case, it's an innovative game based on a cool concept.

An excellent and original family game revolving around an ingenious marble dispenser gadget. AP prone gamers can make the game stall badly, though.

Don't like the rule where each person must get the same number of turns. I won purely because I claimed the last skill token and being the 2nd and last player, ended the game. I'm not sure if there is a first player advantage in this game but don't really enjoy how the game ends.

Played 2 2-player games with my 6 year old. First playthrough was enjoyable due to the interesting gameplay mechanic of selecting marbles to cause chain reactions. I have serious doubts about the replayability of this game however due to the fact that all points are in the open without any hidden. The end game can come very abruptly too when the last player to go takes the last skill token, suggesting that going last might be the best choice. Decisions are not very meaningful each turn too where one tries to optimize the number of marbles one can take through causing multiple chain reactions. I guess the main decision is really what potions to choose to put in your bunsen burner. It also seems like the main strategy is to go for big scoring potions with good value. Potions give varying points but cost various amounts of ingredients even for the same points. For a fun family game, I think it is a great one. But not one I will suggest all the time.

RATING: N/A
A game of making potions.
There is a wonderful cardboard treasure chest looking box that holds all of the marbles, making this game really cool.
Players will simply remove a marble from the game board/box. This will cause other marbles to collide.
Marbles that match when they collide will be yours for the taking.
All marbles collected are ingredients for your potions.

The potions are rather large cardboard flasks with little circles cut out to hold your marbles in place.
When you collect all the correct colored marbles on your potion you flip it over and it becomes usable as a special power.

Beautiful game with great components and simple rules and game play.

I don't know if I am just horribly bad at this game, or I'm playing against really good players, or what the deal is.  But I will say this -- yes I can set up one or two explosions, but never more than that -- yet others manage to pull marble after marble after marble from the tray.  This seems like it should be a game that works well with the way my brain works, but alas, no.

Potion Explosion is a game that's based on the "match-3" games that are popular on mobile electronics.  The game features a big cardboard display that has several columns of colored marbles.  During your turn, you select a marble to take from the display, and then if that causes two marbles (or groups of marbles) of the same color to touch, you get those as well.  Of course, this could cause more similarly-colored marbles to touch, which you also get in a cascade effect.  These marbles are used to complete potions, which provide points and can be also be used for special powers in taking marbles.  There are also bonus points that can be earned for multiples of the same type of potions, or sets of different potions.  It's a very simple game, and can have some downtime issues as people stare at the marble display and puzzle out what to take.  I had fun, but there's little planning and I can see where it might bog down.

Really long downtime for what it's worth. Absolutely but recommended with four players; three might be fine, but it can be slow. Since the marbles rows change each turn, there is little room to plan anything, thus slowing the game down. Otherwise, fine mechanisms.

Very nice components and novel mechanic of how the explosions happen. However there was some downtime instead of quick gameflow. The choices are usually strategically very simple, but more complex on the puzzle side of how to maximize effectiveness - good if the game takes short time, but in 4 player game of PE it starts to drag.

Interesting game based on matching and set collection to get the potions for points and game end.  I liked the different potions to add into the game.

Set collection. Fairly light tactical decisions (gateway). Gimmicky, toy factor 'Bejewled/Candy Crush style' marble hopper (fun and novel), completing potions give you special abilities. Plays well with 2, families.
-AP prone (especially with more players), some take that actions (but you don't play with every type of potion each game)

RATING: 7
This is a cute game where players are selecting colored marbles from a box, in order to place them on order tiles. When a tile is complete, you get points and it gives you a one time use special ability. 

No question this game is gimmicky. The marbles are nice, and satisfying to click around. There really aren't any important decision points, and there's some amount of flip luck as the game rewards you for collection potions that are either the same or are sets of different. 

That being said, It's relatively quick and obsessively enjoyable. I've played this many times in person, and obsessively on my phone using the app version. There's plenty of room to make clever moves in the game, and responding to what other players are going for and navigating the sequence of abilities combined with trying to judge what color marbles you are capable of getting on your turn is a compelling puzzle that's always shifting and changing.

Interesting game.  Very light.  Similar to Bejeweled App but instead of icons, you have marbles in rows.  You pull one marble out of one of the rows.  If similar colors click together, then you get all those marbles as well....you can have 'chain reactions.'

When you get marbles, you place them on potions that you are trying to mix.

You can draw a 2nd marble on your team by paying 2 vactory points.

Also, once you finish a potion you can 'drink it' to get a special power.

Simple game, but fun and recommended.

Played this with my Girlfriend.  It was new for both of us.  Took a few minutes to learn. The rules are very well written - Leaving no questions unanswered.  As I was trying to learn the game, my girlfriend had already moved on to getting down the strategizing and kicked my ass!   

As a two player game, this game can have a bit of a chess feel.  You need to not only think about think about what you are doing, but what you will be leaving your opponent.  There is almost no information that you don't see as no cards are held in secret and no dice to roll.  The only random is what some of the marbles will be on the next turn.  Don't think of this as a cute little game.  It's a challenge.

I haven't played this with more than two players, but I can see how it will feel a little more random as you cannot control the marbles that some players will get to choose from and it might be a little harder to get the potions that you are looking for.  I think it will be a lot a fun with 3.  Not sure about 4.  Will have to see.

I was hoping to absolutely fall in love with this game. It has the gimmicky marble table, but it just looked like a lot of fun. Honestly it wasn't fun in the way I thought it would be. It turned out to be a bit more thinky. Figuring out which marble to take, or what order to take your turn was where the fun was for me. There's nothing quite as satisfying as getting lucky and making that awesome combo and taking like fifteen marbles in one turn. It's a good game, not great, but not bad.

I love Potion Explosion! This game is wonderful and a great introduction for people new to games or when I'm not in the mood for a heavy Euro.  The concept is that the players are wizard students trying to create potions by collecting the correct ingredients (marbles of a specific color.) It's a great game that doesn't take terribly long to play and works well with 2, 3, or 4 players.

Potion explosion brings all the fun of Bejewelled or Candy Crush to the table (Or Bubblet - a fantastic "marbles" game I played on the Palm Pilot for countless hours nearly 20 years ago).  You pick a marble out of a slanted carboard rack and if removing that marble causes two marbles of the same color to "clack" together, they "explode" and you get those marbles as well, which could trigger other "explosions", giving you more marbles.  You then slot those different colored marbles into potions that require a certain amount of different colored marbles to finish a potion "Recipe".  Finished potions give you victory points and special powers that let you get more marbles or mess with the rack of marbles in some way.  Looking for combinations of marbles to "explode" on your turn is a ton of fun.  Watching other players make their picks and grabbing a whole row of marbles makes you wish you had seen the move.  This is a great experience game with a high toy factor.  The tactile experience is unlike any other game I have in my collection.  This isn't the deepest game in the world, but it has fun in spades.

RATING: 7.8
Fun, quick-to-learn 'combination-game'. It's much like those mobile games, where you have to combine several pieces of the same colour. 
Great game to play with younger people, or just if you want to have a quick bite. 

Using the different potions means you still have to think strategically on which to use and when to use it.

Played once with 3P. A simple resource collection-and-conversion game where the highlight is the Candy Crush-like method of obtaining ingredients. Pick a marble up from the dispenser, watch the other marbles in line slide down and pick more up if marbles of the same colour collide. It's a fairly good gimmick, and requires some care so as not to leave chains for your opponents to exploit.

The production values of the version I played were a little spotty (irregular sized marbles and poorly cut potion stands) but they didn't detract from the gameplay. However, I did have trouble quickly distinguishing potions which were used to form scoring sets and which were already used for their effects. While the gameplay beyond the marble-dispensing gimmick is too simplistic, it would likely appeal to the family and non-gaming crowd.

This game is beautiful! However, I worry that the components don't compensate for the gameplay. Something I've noticed with CMON's first The World of Smog game. Very nice, chunky, colorful components with less under the hood. I don't think I'd trade this one away because it's a fun filler that you can play with gamers and non-gamers alike. I enjoy having games like this in my collection and will keep this one for now!

It's fine. I'm sure the app-ness of the marble tray is intriguing to people who mainly play mobile games ... but it doesn't really have anything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Potion Explosion employs an innovative way to gather resources, but depends on constructing a fairly elaborate component out of cardboard to implement it.  The game suffers as a result because the constructed marble tray, while being an interesting feat of cardboard design and architecture, doesn't function perfectly and jams sometimes (among other problems).  Also, the marbles are of different sizes and have imperfections which can both cause problems inside the tray.  The game play flow is fairly straightforward, but the possibilities presented in by marble tray can definitely promote analysis paralysis.

This is really quite good. If you like playing Match-3 type of mobile games, this is the perfect incantation in boardgame form. It plays quickly, and I find myself drawn to moving forward to fulfill my potions. The set collection is intriguing, as it both allows you to score points, but also as you collect potions, you get bonus actions, so it's important (and challenging) to strike a balance between the two. Presentation is also quite lovely; the marbles look spectacular!

This was very good! It uses a ramp (6? columns), several different colors of marbles, and the Bejeweled mechanism where getting groups of like-colored marbles "explode". Here, you take one marble from any ramp and let the marbles above roll down. Exploding marbles are removed from the ramps. You use these to fulfill orders for potions (6 different types; you start the game with 2 in your display). When you complete a set of 3 like-colored potions, or a set of 5 different-colored potions, you get a VP award chit from "the professor". Completed potions can be consumed once for their special power (e.g., take extra marbles, steal marbles from someone, etc.). At the END of your turn, you replenish your display to have 2 unfulfilled potions. The game ends after ... something happens ... and the player with the most VP (potions are worth VP according to their difficulty) wins!

Simple game, cool ramp/Bejeweled mechanism (which works way better than whatever [thing=32165][/thing] had tried), nice tactile marbles ... very enjoyable!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an abstract game played with different colored marbles in a track with multiple rows.  You collect the marbles to complete potions for points.  The mechanic the game hinges on is the namesake potion explosion.  When, after taking a marble from the track, two marbles of the same color connect you get all the connected marbles of that color.  This can chain into other explosions and give you large amounts of marbles in one turn.

I'm not typically a big fan of abstract games but this one can be entertaining, I think because playing with the marbles is fun.  The toy factor is high with this one.

However, that same device that makes it fun and offers such high toy factor while fun and looks cool doesn't really work that well.  When you complete a potion or when you take too many marbles you put them back by just dumping them in the top of the device.  The marbles then often clump together and go into one or two rows leaving others empty.  The nature of this mechanic also causes same colored marbles to be next to each other for most of the game.

Good grief, Potion Explosion itches the Dr. Mario part of my brain while incorporating that aspect into a silly but strategic success story.  The Harry Potter-ish theme of potion creation (a few subtle HP references in the game) mixed with clever mechanics makes an overall potent concoction.

RATING: 4
For a family game, I can see this being delightful. However, for me it's too long and too lacking in interesting decisions. The play-time overstays its welcome, and even if I were to shorten it by removing a set of Skill Tokens, I don't think I'd want to play again. Don't get me wrong, the joy of manipulating physical marbles in a way that emulates a game like Bejeweled is very satisfying. Searching the tableau of marbles for an elaborate combo is a worthwhile puzzle, at least for a few turns, but I need more than a gimmick. That's where the recipe cards need to pick up the slack, and they just don't.

Honestly, I'd like to hear some other opinions on this one, because for me, I feel as though I'm missing something -- or perhaps it's a game that just doesn't connect with my sense of goofy fun. For something goofy, a game like Camel Up is so much more entertaining.

Not a bad game but I would like a bit more variety in the mechanics. 

You pick a marble from one of the slides. When the neighboring marbles are of the same color, you may pick them up as well. Chain reactions can happen.  Then you use the marbles to create potions which give you points and extra actions or abilities. 

The slides and the marbles look great and it is fun when you draw a lot, but it is pretty repetitive.

The game doesn't play nearly as explosive as you might think when you hear the title. It's actually quite static and players prone to AP will find their nemesis here. Having played Bejeweled 3 infinitely, I like the game quite a bit though. It transports the Match x gems/marbles very well and it's a good thing this one doesn't have a real-time element. Add potions for "Power ups" and you've got Potion Explosion. -1 point overall for the extremely fiddly assembly of the marble dispenser. The pieces just don't fit properly together. As soon as it was functional we started the game because otherwise construction could have taken the whole of the gamenight.

[thing=180974][/thing] is a pretty simple game: just take ingredients (marbles) in a way that, after taking the marble you want, other ones, of the same colors, touch each other (exploding), thus you will be able to also take them; and if after taking these, others of the same colors also touch each other, you will be able to take these as well; this goes until marbles of different colors touch and the reaction is finished. With these marbles you make potions, which are worth points and, once done, have a one-time use, doing special things such as taking marbles, allowing use of wrong colors to make potions; stealing the reserve of someone else; and others.

It is a short game, normally lasting around 45 minutes, with little direct interaction - mostly is indirect: taking ingredients from the same source and going for the same stock of potions to be made. This means that [thing=180974][/thing] is tremendously friendly with a bias to family gaming, due to the small conflict factor and easyness to teach and to play (even more if not using the special powers of the potions).

The components are colorful and well done. The production, as a whole, is excellent.

Of negatives there is the luck in the coming of marbles, as part of them are kept hidden in the top of rows and the random order can give advantage to someone. Still, [thing=180974][/thing] isn't a game of heavy strategy or complexity, therefore the presence of luck should matter little or nothing at all.

Overall, [thing=180974][/thing] has mediocre mechanics, but it is a good game inside what it proposes to be: easy and rather quick entertainment, friendly and without major complications; good for families as well as more veterans players looking for something to relax.

It's light enough to satisfy the beginners and brain burning enough to keep the advanced players interested - it just hits that perfect sweet spot. Every turn is a puzzle to solve and a ton of fun at that. The only drawback is that sometimes it can cause some analysis paralysis and downtime, especially when it comes to using potions for long combo moves. But that's a minor thing really, overall Potion Explosion is a very unique and pleasurable family game.

This game gets high marks for concept but we had to subtract for the frustration of poor marbles. Several were oddly shaped and a few were broken. Another player put the tray together before I got to the table so I can't speak to their unhappiness with it. I do know it fell apart when we tried to put it in the game box when we had finished playing. We may possibly just leave the tray in the box the next time we play. Going to try to find better marbles because in spite of the component qualities we found gameplay to be fun!

You already know how to play this if you have ever played a Match 3 video game. The production quality is excellent and the combos you can pull off set this well above the crowd of games also seeking your attention.

This feels like a lighter game to me, but some of the mechanics took a bit more explanation than I expected. This game does a great job of capturing what makes games like bejeweled fun while not being entirely derivative and working with the physical components. There's quite a bit of luck and tactics here while the strategic play is largely relegated to the special abilities and points of the potions you've picked up. This won't be a game that comes out a ton, but I look forward to playing it some more.

Delightful family game that combines the best elements of Candy Crush and resource gathering. Strategic decisions are very light, but the components are stellar. This one always hits a home run at conventions. Everyone will want to join in when they see you play. Also, +1 for the well-written, wacky rulebook!

Family/gateway pattern recognition set collection game featuring a gravity fed potion library of colored marbles.  Random select potion shaped player boards with holes to fill correct color combinations of marbles. Pull marbles from the library that cause Candy-Crush-like collisions of same colored marbles to collect bonus marbles.  Complete a potion for points and refill the marble library. Empty the completed potion for a special ability including stealing from your alchemist peers.  Play on a table cloth or you will lose your marbles.  The question is whether it is the novelty of the gravity fed marbles that makes this game appealing?

A fun game that has a mechanic similar to games like candy crush or other phone games where you pull on piece out and try to get the other pieces to line up and create explosions. Looking forward to the expansion.

A fun, lightweight family game. For what it does (a 45m game with the kids), it does OK. Not a game I'd own if I didn't have kids around; there are better gateway games.

Fun game. Really simple once you learn. Maybe too much down time as you wait your turn. I would like it to speed up a little. People who stare too long are the issue. Making the potions and using them for an advantage is important.

Great, light game.  Easily taught and has tons of replay value to it.  Only grip is that the marbles came chipped and seem to be very cheaply made.  Not a big issue as long as they still roll down the dispenser.

RATING: 5
Didn't like this all that much.  It wasn't terrible but some of the rules limiting the number of explosions (for example, you can't use a power and then take the resulting explosion) really killed the game for me.  I get that it's probably for reasons of balance, but it definitely takes away from the fun factor in my opinion.

Provisional rating after a full demo game at SPIEL 2015. The game is definitely entertaining, and pulling marbles fun. Sadly there's nothing to do when it's not your turn, but I would enjoy playing this some more. The rating could go up or down, depending on how it stands up to repeat plays.

Marbles rolling down the chutes feels more like a toy than a game, but it's a well done simulation of those guilty pleasure match-type video games. The set collection of potion brewing bogged down the pacing for me, but pulling marbles and making 'explosions' was fun. There's some advanced thought needed to properly set up the marbles for a big explosion by using help tokens and quaffing potions to get the right ingredients, so this game is not totally mindless.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting take on set collection as you get to use special potion powers and some spatial deduction to collect as many marbles as you can.  These in turn help you make more potions for more powers in a race to make the biggest and best potions in the right quantities for bonus points.  My first game dragged a bit with three young players but I could see this being quite fun with a more focused group so I'd like to try it again sometime!

Kudos for clever use of marbles.  

The potions are surprisingly ugly, big missed opportunity there.  And getting the marbles to behave when dumping them back into the (really cool) table can be a chore.  

Props for originality, but this needs another development pass.  I always like the idea of playing more than I actually like playing it.

Gioco che si conferma divertente. Tutto sta a vedere con chi si gioca. Se qualcuno con il quale giocate non lo "ama" ve lo farà odiare. Da giocare con le persone giuste! Piccolo aggiornamento Maggio 2017, nonostante è messo li sullo scaffale il mio gruppo preferisce sicuramente i "German". E' stato un ottimo acquisto ma obiettivamente non è tra i preferiti dei miei amici che lo considerano troppo "leggero". Peccato :-(

This game has potential, but with no reliable way to acquire gems I can't recommend it.  Half the cards are unusable without gems, and whoever gets lucky enough to gain gems is going to have a much easier time than the rest of the players.

+ Quick, chaotic game that anyone can jump into almost immediately; Trying to figure out who your opponent is creates a personal tension between players
- Perhaps too chaotic.


Why it's previously-owned:
For a light/gateway game, there are other options that are either more fun or more interesting strategically.
This one got traded in a huge online trade.

Would play this over citadels, I think. Because, this is citadels on a map. Citadels has a little more depth in the cardplay, but the map/race here is fun (if frustrating)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Citadels character selection is bolted to a very simple race game. The shaman and the thief prompt a degree of double think in making your selections that will be familiar to Citadels players.  Otherwise, there is nothing at all interesting going on.

Production quality is not very good, with poor English on the cards and in the rules and poor matching of the colours on player cards to the pieces.  The artwork is uninspired though functional.

RATING: 5.2
Overall, I was disappointed with this one.  I like--maybe even love--Citadels, so, admittedly, I had high hopes.  Things just feel too wonky to me.  There are wild swings in game play, and the Child card almost breaks the game in my book (it certainly does for a 2-player game, imho).  Some rules could be clearer, and the spaces affecting play on the board (e.g. Temples, Deep Forests and the like) need to be more distinct from one another and more pronounced in general.  On the plus side, it's simple enough to play with young children, and the Character cards offer some interesting choices (and, unfortunately, some that are too obvious at times).

UPDATE: I have to knock this down a notch, from a 6.1 to a 5.5.  It's over too quickly, and there's way too much luck involved.  And, as I already indicated, the Child card breaks the game.

The sort of 'retheming' or 'reskinning' of a game system that I wholeheartedly approve of, Lost Temple takes Bruno Faidutti's excellent game Citadels and then transmogrifies it into a fun jungle racing game based loosely on pulp action properties like Indiana Jones. So you've still got that character order and those variable abilities, plus a tactile feel of a board, with terrain tokens and other obstacles that can affect play, neat powers, and some good, lighthearted fun in racing towards that temple. Does it replace Citadels, or nudge out Mascarade? Absolutely not, but I'm happy to own all three, and of the three, this might be the best with younger players.

RATING: 7
I've only been able to play this once, but I really enjoyed it that one time. It uses Citadels-like role selection to fuel a racing game. It is light and easy to pick up, so it is great for a family game. I love trying to figure out what roles other players may have taken.

It's just a race with the personality card mechanism from Citadels.  It's not a bad game and has some good things in it but it's over way to quick.  The secret tiles you can collect along the way don't really serve a very good purpose.

Played again with 4 players this time and it's better.

Monsieur Faidutti toyed with the sequential role selection mechanic he already used with great success in Citadels, and proposed a game I would describe as Citadels: The Race.
The game would possibly have been a nice family game, if a couple of roles were different: the Shaman switching power and Child catching-up power seem to make everything else quite pointless...

As much as I love Citadels, I can’t say I’ve enjoyed playing the Lost Temple: it’s a bleached copy of its forerunner, made even duller by a board whose only use seems to be to slow the game and annoy the players. Everything here feels too complex and unoriginal: even though the Indiana Jones theme looks pretty tasty, it quickly fades in the game’s vacuity and isn’t enough to keep it running.
As a matter of fact, it’s hard to make a better card game than Citadels.

Not a bad game, role selection and how they play out reminds me quite a bit of Citadels.  The chance tokens are there to add some randomness to the game since the cards themselves don't have much interaction between players but at the same time if you don't look at them they can easily beat you down.

RATING: 3
Wow, this is a pretty bad game. I've played and enjoyed Citadels and Mission Red Planet, but feel like this one just does not work. All of the fun psychological elements of Faidutti's other role-selection games are missing here: there is no "double-think" as you try to get into other players' heads, partly because the roles are so generic, but also because the game is so random that there is really no way to know what someone is going to choose. 

The wild swings created by the Shaman are too huge to be justified in a racing game, and can place someone in very last place right up to the finish line in a single move. It's stupid. Maybe if each player had their own deck to go through (a la Mission Red Planet) the game could give you more of a shot at predicting the moves of others, but as it is, this is a terrible implementation of a good mechanic. Too bad.

RATING: 6
I have a soft spot for this game.  People like to call it "Citadels with a board", which might be close to true (but it's much simpler than Citadels).  I'd rather call it "mean Candyland".

It's a race game, pure and simple.  You draft roles, like in Citadels, but here they determine how far you move and whether you get any special powers that turn.  For example, the Canoe lets you spend gems to move, the Thief steals gems, and the Craftsman gets a machete (needed to move through deep jungle space).

There are definitely tough decisions here - you have to plan around what you think the other players will take.  For example, if you are sitting on a large pile of gems, you can't take the obvious choice or you'll be too easy for the thief to find.  But I think it's best not to take this one too seriously - it's really delightful to play with a group that can handle a lot of "screw your neighbor".  There are just so many _mean_ choices.

2017-04-23 : First play and I was sorely disappointed in this game. From the outside it looked like a modernized Citadels/Machiavelli game from the same designer, but whereas in Citadels you can sort of guess what other players are going to pick based on what they already build, it's a complete luck-fest in this game as there's no strategic depth, only tactical play. Worse than Citadels, which is barely an ok game, so it goes on the trade pile.

Fun, light game, great for playing with kids or adults after a heavy session. Bluffing and double-guessing in a fast race for some laughs.

A sortof Citidels-lite type game whereby instead of building a tableau you are racing through the jungle but the role selection is very similar to citidels. 

I like the art style but the board is much bigger than it needs to be and the tokens are a bit fiddly and frustrating, as are the machete requiring dense jungle spaces They dont seem to add anything to the game and can easily be jumped over rendering them pretty moot.

 i don't know .....it lacks the meanness of citidels

I really enjoy this hidden role race game.  This game scales really well.  I have played this with 2-6 players and all work well.   We always place a card face down and then look at the hand that was drafted to you.  This really seems to add much more challenge to the game as there is much more hidden information.  I did play this once as a 2 player the other way around and it was not much fun.  It was just too easy to know what the other player was holding. I love that you must read the other players and manage your gems so that you can move when needed.  Two bad marks for this game are:1. the rules seem to suggest that you look at the drafted cards and then place one face down, which as I said, does not seem to work well.  2.  If playing with AP prone person, you will need to use a timer or each turn could take way to long.   It is just not cool to take 2-3 min. to take a turn when 4+ people are playing.   It also gives this player an advantage and forces other to rush their turns to make up time.  This last point is really a player problem and not the fault of the game.   A final + for this game is that you are never really out.  There is usually some way to catch up.

I think this is a pretty clever and fun game, but it's never really landed with any aplomb among any group I've played it with.  It's weird, race games are usually better received.  I think the card selection is just opaque enough to hurt it with more casual groups, and it's not heavy enough for serious game groups to spend a large amount of time with.

Based on the Citadels role card drafting mechanism. But, in this one the players are racing rather than building districts within their respective cities.

So, it is a filler type game that is less than Citadels, but more than Incan Gold.

This is a re-implementation of Citadels. I find Lost Temple less successful as there seems to be less interaction. The characters can either move very fast or only hobble allong with 1 or 2 steps. The game we played had one runaway winner - and it was difficult catching up with that position. If you swap places it was simply just a different player wayyy in front. 
The Chance-Tiles I found a bit too random and sometimes too debilitating. I'll stick to Citadels... ;-)

I enjoyed this game very much although your decisions are fairly base on luck and process of elimination. I love the components (especially the green gems/jade) but for some unknown reasons my character pawns do not all correspond with the character cards.

I've only played this game one time, and I really want to like it. My biggest complaint with its spiritual predecessor, Citadels, was that the city building element was kind of boring and took a little too much time. This game alleviates that somewhat by eliminating the city building aspect and replacing it with a fairly straightforward race (which might be a little too far on the other end of the spectrum). The role selection is fun, though, and we laughed a lot while playing it. I will definitely play it again, and I could see my rating going up.

After a particularly tense initial game where my friends and I argued the rule that while catching up, the Child can get thru the deep jungle without a machete, we came here and saw that the designer said "Nope, you need a machete".

Once the rule was established, the game got a lot funner than I originally thought...  It looks simple, but theres a lot of strategy and deduction going on that is enjoyable...

This is basically Citadels rethemed from a city building game into a racing game.  Nine character cards determine your actions and they are selected almost exactly like Citadels.  In the end, I prefer the theme of Citadels and would choose to play that instead.  Looks like Faidutti might be going the Knizia route and releasing games which are basically what he's done before with a slight variation...

RATING: 7
An interesting take on the hidden role selction games popularized by Citadels. The game has great production value, and the art is top notch. The problem is that with hidden role selection I think I want a more meaty game to play up those role selections. This one just felt kind of random and almost uncontrollable from the start. With role selection games this can be a general feeling but with the short play time it really felt like this was pretty much the game in a nutshell. Nothing was there to smooth out the game. Overall a decent game, and I wouldn't mind playing again but definitely not something that is going into my collection anytime soon.

RATING: 5.5
It seemed like this game would play like a faster version of Citadels, given it has the same role selection mechanic, but replaces the card play with a simple race to the finish line. Unfortunately, our first 4-player game seemed to take a bit longer than Citadels. Worse, while some cards are unique, there's often quite a bunch which all work out as having the same effect. This results in layers feeling powerless to do anything about their position in the game.

I suspect that the game is a bit more interesting when playing with 6-8 players, but I also imagine it would play quite a bit more slowly.

On the bright side, this seems very easy to teach, and there's enough luck/randomness that it could be a suitable game to play with more casual players.

The character choosing mechanism of Citadels has long felt out of place to me. Its chaos didn't seem well suited to a strategic building game.
So it seemed like a good idea to re-use the mechanism in a light racing game. Unfortunately, the result is that there is too little game left to capture my interest.
Too bad, because I wanted to like this game.

A fun game in the styel of Citadels (I think, I've never played Citadels, but I've seen it played.)  In any case, it was fun, but we had a fun group.  The theme is kinda weakly applied, but the gameplay is good.  If the phrase "fire-breathing saber-tooth gorilla" becomes a regular joke in our group, it is because of this game.

There should at least be one character that has the ability to produce a gem. It's the whole currency of the game that players generally need to move their character, and yet non of the character abilities even produce any, besides what the start of the game provides you. Any additional gems must come only from the random tiles placed along the path, of which there isn't very many. Lost Temple really lacks in gameplay, and doesn't come close to Citadels or Mission Red Planet. Hard pass.

Lost Temple is a lovely game and a very nice light game for non-gamers. When you are playing with non-gamers and they are repeatedly saying that they like the game, think it looks great and is fun, you know you are onto a winner. The Citadels card mechanic is the only comparison to be made and those who bang on comparing this game with Citadels need to get over it. THIS IS NOT CITADELS NOR IS IT TRYING TO BE! Lost Temple stands on its own as a solid light, fun family race game with a nice Indiana Jones-type theme. Easy to learn, relatively fast playing, interactive, with a nice dose of randomness makes for a terrifically fun mix. Bruno Faidutti has done an excellent job transferring the card mechanic to a different style game and it works charmingly. I would not hesitate to recommend this game.

RATING: 5
A disappointing game. At first appears light and fun, but soon devolves into pure random chaos. The Shaman's ability to trade victory position with another player ruins the game. Why bother investing in advancing a few spaces when all that progress will likely be traded to someone else sooner or later? Citadels-style assassination sounds more mean, but I'd far rather lose a turn (a temporary setback) than lose all my points.

The Shaman feels *way* too powerful -- first game it basically came down to who got guessed as the target for the Shaman (which was basically a coin flip). It's ok, but definitely no Citadels.

----- Preiliminary thoughts -----

I have not played it, but it seems to be a light version of Citadels; they just change the buildings by a race. The one and only game mechanic is the character selection.

I'm not interested on it because I already own Citadels and this game doesn't seem to add anything citdaels doesn't have (components are nicer, but also much more expensive and not really needed).

Citdadels seems to be a better game in every aspect.

Simple traditional roll-and-move race, where the die has been replaced by Citadels cards. Certainly not an improvement over the traditional way; Pretty much any game by Selecta or Drei Magier beats this any day, hands down.

RATING: 5
Lost Temple didn't really excite me. The players are racing through the jungle to get to the eponymous Temple. Each round they change identities (?!) and get different special powers. Some of the different characters can attack the others, although character selection is by secret draft so there is a degree of randomness.

In other words, it is Citadels on a racetrack.

I like Citadels, especially with smaller player counts. Lost Temple seemed comparatively chaotic, although it was brisk to play. Another game I will play again, but I am not champing at the bit to do so.

Very similar to Citadels in a lot of ways, but introduces some extra random elements and takes away the ability to defend yourself (unless you pick the Shaman, which is overpowered anyway). Both of these things make it worse than Citadels, and I can't really think of any reason why I'd play this game over Citadels.

The Shaman is probably the worst card in the game since it allows you to swap positions with any player. It looks like the winner of the game will be whoever correctly guesses the role of the leading player near the end of the game and then successfully picks a role different to what the next Shaman player guesses. A very uninteresting mechanic IMHO.

It's a simple race game.  I say it's vastly superior version of candy land with a better theme.

It's not quite a "sweet spot" game because it's just a little too simple for me to get engrossed in the game, but I still enjoy playing it.

You just have to know that this game is not going to be strategy-based.  It's a light little luck fest. It's fun if you can "let go" - you'll be frustrated otherwise.

I like Machiavelli a lot. The picking of the rolecards and trying to figure out who is doing what.
This game is based on the same principle, but with an other theme. Racing though the jungle. Whoever gets to the temple first, wins.
It seemed like a lot of fun, but halfway the game, we all got a bit stuck.
Only then we found out that we forgot that you get a smaragd at the beginning of every turn. Well, that would have made a lot of difference.
So I am going to give this a second chance for sure.
We played with 4, but just like machiavelli, I think this will be more fun with 5 or more.

I pre-ordered this back in 2011, when I still preferred simple games and was in love with Citadels. I don't regret the purchase - the game still gets played a couple of times a year (which is not bad for an old game, when considering the number of games we have to choose from), and it's never less than fun. But, despite the obvious differences in what you're trying to do and what actually happens in a player turn, it's too-clearly modeled on Citadels, and ultimately scratches a similar itch. It's hard to imagine wanting to play both on the same evening. Neither is better than the other, and they're not really the same game - but they're still pretty similar.

Definitely a good light game though. I still don't understand why it's ranked quite so low on BGG.

Me and character selection have a love/hate relationship (see Citadels).  I see the value of this game at the larger player counts where the down time in Citadels can make that game drag a bit.  Here it is just the character selection which can take long enough when looking at a handful of cards.  The actual racing action is relatively short. 

I have a niggling suspicion that the game needs players with relatively balanced experience otherwise one player might be forever in last place gaining the idol several times and forcing the player to his right to constantly have only two character choices.  (Something that has happening in my games and adds to my "hate" relationship with the game.)  Lest anyone say that even with two choices, that person could win so it shouldn't matter - doesn't that imply that one should win almost randomly picking characters?  If so, how much game is there?  A better way of generalizing the last comment might be to think that this game has a strong social factor so is highly dependent on the group dynamics.

Citadels: the race game.  It is kind of hilarious that Bruno pulled this off.  It might be a half decent but dull and simple roll and move game, but the inclusion of The Child which catches up one player and The Shaman that switches positions makes any kind of intention to get ahead of other players futile.  How many times is this game going to come down to switching tokens with the first place player and strolling across the finish line?  So lame.

This game is essentially a clone of Citadels where all the players are racing on a map instead of building city districts.

It was an okay game but I would always rather play Citadels than this.  I felt like I had a lot less control over moving on a map than I do building my tableau in Citadels.  The roles also didn't feel varied enough and that made it a lot less interesting.  There were multiple roles that allowed you to catch up in the race, spend gems for movement, move to the next space on the board, etc. whereas in Citadels they all feel different.

Single 4-player game (all newbies). Character selection with very limited impact (it seemed). Our game hinged on two actions - one a no-brainer due to the face-up characters; the other a good guess as to another player's 50/50 character choice. With 3 face-up characters (in a 4-player game) there are rounds when all selectable characters have limited opportunities for interaction.

Maybe it would be better with 6 or more players?

tl;dr: well, it doesn't outstay it's welcome

I'm not a fan of the games by [person=125][/person], but I'm also open to trying his games.
This game reuses the [thing=478][/thing] role selection mechanism and it does retain that tension in selecting the right role. This game is a good deal shorter though and uses the mechanism to make a race game. I appreciate the way the role selection is used, but the rest of the game doesn't do anything special with it.
So I didn't dislike this game as much as some of his other designs, but it did leave me wanting a bit. I had hoped for a bit more.

Citadels: The Race Game. This is about what you'd expect, but even more chaotic and random. The role selection mechanic works reasonably well with the building of districts in Citadels.

n Lost Temple, the players are explorers looking for a mysterious lost temple. To find it, they must cross the jungle and get help from the indigenous people. The first player to reach the temple on the last space of the track wins the game.

The game uses a character selection rule similar to Faidutti's Citadels, and the game includes nine different characters: Shaman, Thief, Seer, Priest, Elder, Craftsman, Scout, Canoe and Child.

In the dense jungle of southeast Asia you must take your chances and start your journey. As an explorer, you will cross the jungle and ask help from the local people. But can you outwit your opponents and claim the discovery of the Lost Temple?

It's definitely a gateway game that I would use with non-gamers before I move to something like Mission Red Planet.

This is a neat and light racing game that works very well within its simple structure and, for once, I'm on board Faidutti's recent complaints about overdeveloped games: this lightness is excellent (for this game, at least). 

Some gamers have not liked this system (Citadels) used in a racing game. I disagree, and furthermore find it to work even better here. That's not to say the game is better than Citadels. I like them equally. I just think the character drafting mechanic from Citadels feels made for this game.

Own the promo character.

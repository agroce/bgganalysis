After trying online and loving it, I've been trying to find this game, which seems impossible.  I'm now wondering if I can somehow improvise a set.  I think this may become a 10 if I'm ever able to do so.  This is the type of abstract puzzle game that I love (and similar to ZERTZ in some ways).

I like this game. It's a quickish thinker with easy rules.

The game ends when one player has collected all colours. It can end quickly and anti climactic if someone aims to catch 'em all straight away.

So far I've only tried it with two players. This seems like it would be the ideal number. Going further away from abstractness with more players seems like it could be frustrating since there probably won't be much to plan for futurewise. But I suspect that a three player game can be very entertaining as well.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite pyramid games, Volcano plays somewhat like a multi-player two-dimensional Mancala. The Mega-Volcano variant is especially good. An alternative way to play the 6x6 game is to use four nests of nine different colors and five small caps of a tenth color. The depth for this variant is much more than the standard 5x5 game using five nests of five colors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game for either competition or solitaire.  I play the 6x6 Mega Volcano variant most often, with 4 nests of 9 colors.

In the Pyramid Arcade, Looney Labs attaches the Volcano name to the Caldera rules.  I think the BGG entries for Volcano and Caldera should be merged.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thanks to the purchase of two new stashes of Icehouse pieces, I now had 6 different colours, and thus was able to play a game of regular Volcano. The game is delightfully abstract, and actually a bit more clever than I first envisaged. You get a lot of points for completed trees&mdash;be them of a single or of multiple colours&mdash;but the game ends when someone collects all 5 colours. This puts a great deal of pressure on the players, especially when someone collects their fourth colour. It also means you should be actively trying to end the game once you're in the lead, but be careful that the other player(s) don't catch up! Looking forward to more playing time.

Volcano is a perenial Pyramid Game favorite around here. While I tend to like classic Volcano the most, the Pyramid Arcade variant is starting to grow on me. Perhaps with the new color mix and power-plays Volcano will start moving up the ladder again. Only time will tell.

I bought a craft box to carry around my icehouse pieces and made a board on the outside of it. 

Excellent game that I've been playing a LOT of over the last several months.  It has surprising depth, but can lead to long periods of time just staring at the board.  But the Analysis Paralysis reduces with experience.

1/2011- Stopped playing for a while. Still find it interesting when I play, but my usual opponent doesn't play any more.

RATING: 9
As pyramid games go, this is a little on the heavy side.  Somebody told me that I'm good at this game because it's a spatial analysis game, which is apparently right up my alley.  I have no reason to disbelieve them. Update: I played in the Floating Tournament at Origins 2008, and learned a few things.  Most of my plays are teaching games, which made me a little complacent when playing actual experienced players.  Still, I held my own.  Update2: I now favor Caldera, the successor game to Volcano.

Volcano is a puzzle game about capturing collections of pieces, but it falls in primarily as pattern recognition.  Figutre out what you need and iff you can get it.  If not, move to the second best option.  As a puzzle game, some players will do much better than others either by being familiar with puzzles or by expereince.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Unintuitive at first, fairly chaotic later. There's little room for strategy as each move is essentially a search for maximum immediate gain: more than one pyramid of any kind, a pyramid that completes a set, a pyramid that brings you closer to a set, a pyramid your opponent needs to complete a set. The whole procedure of shuffling caps around to enable a move once you spot it is not what I would call elegant, but it's functional. Pyramids are also pretty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very stimulating, but the crafty players will take fover, muttering "oh, I just can't see any good moves...", move the caps like 15 times, and capture 2 or three pices with a giant smile.

But I keep playing >.>

I've played Volcano now with both two players and with three.  I seem to like it more and more each time, and I'm not generally a fan of many abstracts.  The "theme" is just strong enough to explain the mechanism, and with Icehouse/Treehouse pieces, it sure looks pretty.

Some screwage, but mostly careful defensive play, mixed with calculated moves to advance your own position.  

Me likes it!

Picked up June 2006

I purchased the laser cut Volcano board from Looney Labs plus some extra stashes. Although the board itself is rather expensive for what it is, the clean cut edges and the sold feel make it quite a nice little item to have. Saves me the hassle of making my own and it is far nicer than one I would make in any case. I am seriously considering getting the 6x6 board. Bah...it's cheaper and easier to make my own boards now that I have a source for the acrylic parts I need. See submitted images.

This is a nice solid abstract. Easy to pick up and very good looking. Plays well with 3. The first player has to be careful about setting up the the second player to score an easy two pieces. This game is gonna get a lot of play around here. The Mega-Volcano version is even better!

7x7 is deliciously brutal. I'm carrying this 90% of the time to gaming sessions, just in case.

Oct 2016
Made a hexagonal board to play Hexacano (slightly different than Hexano) - 6x3-nest stashes plus one nest of an opaque in the center. Way tougher than regular Volcano. Needs to at least include the power move rule from Caldera.

This was the game that really sold me on building an Icehouse kit, and it delivered on my expectations -- it's a great game. I like the puzzle quality, which reminds me of Kingdom Builder (another game I love), and even though turns can run long they don't feel long: I spend my "downtime" in deep thought, pondering my next move and coming up with contengency plans.

There's a lot of depth here, and I can see how in time I'll get better at creating long chains of non-erupting moves. I also enjoy the need to balance scoring well with assessing when to race to end the game (or stop your opponent from ending it). It's got a great depth:rules footprint ratio, too. Just a fantastic little game overall.

Setup is a bit fiddly, but the game looks fantastic when it's ready to play; it's certainly not a hardship.

Really like this abstract game actually. The first game really overwhelmed me as it was tough to see the path on which pyramids can explode and score points. But on 2nd game it gets a lot easier to visualize them and everything just falls into place. Since player don't have designated pieces, the turns are extremely tactical - no one wants to set up a good opportunity for the next guy. Good looking game; simple to learn, tough to wrap head around - if that makes sense.

I *really* love Volcano, though I prefer to set up my own board arrangement; it features no colour appearing twice in the same row, column or diagonal (the caps still start across the diagonal).  The default layout means that red gets everywhere, and I find it difficult to delve beneath it to the other colours (though maybe that is the point).

Decent abstract, but leans a bit towards look-ahead just for the sake of look-ahead. Does that make sense? 

Mega-Volcano (on the 6x6 board, rather than 5x5) is significantly better, and for that I'm raising my rating from 6 to 7. With five caps on the 5x5 board, it's pretty much impossible to play defense. I like Volcano [i]much[/i] better online, where you have the time to hunt for that sick sequence. There are some Zertz-like qualities to Volcano which I am coming to appreciate more. OK, 7.5.

One of the best of the Icehouse games (so far). The special characteristics of the Icehouse pieces--color, size, stacking, nesting--are all very well-utilized in this game. Works great for two players, but is also good with three or four, and multi-player abstracts are always welcome. The solitaire challenges (found in Playing With Pyramids) are puzzles rather than games, but are fun to ponder when you don't have an opponent. I like the variant that allows moving only one black cap to trigger a series of non-eruptions. [8 plays]

Making great use of the Icehouse Pyramids' capabilities, Volcano strikes undoubtedly as an abstract of the highest class: it's crisp (a single movement rule plus another rule to extend the turn, a capture rule, a simple system of three scores for the captured pieces according to how they can be sorted, and an end rule), deep (players have got to mingle positional play in three dimensions with collecting sets of different colours), flexible (fixed or random setups are allowed), optically gorgeous (the materials enable a perspective of all pieces on play, in nice colours by the way) and just long enough to feel the brain exercised but not exhausted.

Played one of several game styles. Can't recall the name but the idea was to capture the pyramids by moving smaller pyramids of top of them.
With 4 players it was fiddly and dangerously prone to AP, sometimes I really had to wait for my turn.
This definitely needs more plays but I could see how - with 2 players only - this might really be something!

Have to try those other play styles.

The jumping mechanism reminds me a little bit of Army of Frogs somehow! But the eruption mechanism is interesting and different. I suck at it, but I like it. Works fine 2-player or with more.

This game gave me a newfound respect for the Icehouse stuff. It's as good as any of the Gipf games, and also plays quite well solo (with the rules from Playing with Pyramids). Mini Volcano and Mega Volcano are quite good too, though all are best with two players.

This was just not fun for me.  I can play, and enjoy, abstract games, but this is just far too abstract for my tastes and... it just wasn't fun.

I really hate Chess, but I love Volcano.  Explain that.  I think, like Chess, Volcano rewards players that are willing to "put in the effort".  But Volcano does it in such a simple and yes, elegant manner.  Very easy to teach.  In my experience, new players grasp the game within two turns and the game always generates "let's play this again".

Volcano and Zendo are a toss up for my favorite Icehouse games.

Played this at my friends house. He called this game Volcan. An abstract clean design, with a real brainburn during the whole game. I do not think I need another abstract two-player game but this game looks so nice so I almost went ahead and ordered some pyramids. But games bought on their looks instead of how fun there are to play are shelfwarmers and nothing more. I will play it on my fiends set, or maybe on the Internet, but will not buy this game.

Multiplayer abstract that's a lot of fun for people who enjoy multiplayer abstracts. moves have to be thought out like a puzzle, so there can be long turns and downtime. setup is a bit fiddly and pyramid owners are damned particular about their storage methods. This would be a good choice for a turn-based computer implementation.

Volcano is a mind-bending abstract, using the icehouse pyramids. Players must cause eruptions which will exlpode nests of pyramids onto other pyramids in the line of cap movement. Any pyramids that land on another of the same size are captured. Finding a path to move the caps to a good start point is a great puzzle excercise, and the strategy comes in from having to leave the board in a position that your opponent doesn't get a great move as well as keeping them from collecting certain colors when you are behind. This game is a classic and will be played years from now.

Some interesting decision making, but it can be hard to know what moves to make sometimes.  Interesting abstract nonetheless.

A good puzzle-like game that rewards planning. I've heard that the larger Mega-Volcano game ups the complexity, and I'd like to try it even though I'm in no need of extra complexity!

A 20 minute brain melter.  Add a little bit of player chaos, and no luck the rest of the way.  These icehouse games are a really fun time.  Thanks Looney Labs.

This puzzle game has some aspects of Zertz but is its own game. I have only played on Boardspace but would love to try playing multiplayer. I am strongly considering buying enough Treehouse stashes to play this game.

Great game. Feels a bit more like a multiplayer puzzle than a game in the traditional sense. Does everything you want an Icehouse game to do, though -- ie, it requires a lot of piece manipulation.

Enjoyed this pyramid game a little more than Zendo - glad we played this one first so that I didn't judge the pyramids too harshly.  Still working on my strategy, but the rules are easy once you get playing.

My [gameid=2065] board is a very nice fit for the icehouse pyramids. I use stashes of opaque white to indicate the corners of the board (mountain range).

Did not like this game, but probably because I was terrible at it.  Prefer my abstracts on a flat board.  Lots of AP.

RATING: 6
yeah, it works, it's clever, but it's a brain burner and it's difficult to read the board.
take TZAAR: many pieces around but you can immediately isolate a few moves you really want to make and the real agonizing decision is only among those few moves.
Here you have a staggering amount of opportunities all to be analyzed before deciding.... i simply give up and make whatever move comes up.
BTW, I won my very first 3 players game.

Beautiful and clever little game for 2 or 3 players if you have enough pyramids and a nice board. Now if you can play the "Mega-Volcano"-variant, it gets even better. Using a game clock to limit downtime has proven to be necessary though. With a 60 or 90 seconds limit for the turn it plays wonderful.

Nice abstract using the Ice Tower pieces. Easy to teach and grok as you get going, and has some interesting decisions with the manipulation of the cap pieces. I'd definitely play more.

RATING: 7.5
This is a puzzle game.  Move the caps to maximize your collection of pieces and deny your opponent the moves they need.  The first player advantage in a traditional game has become a big turnoff to me for playing this.

However, the Mega-Volcano variant has been a lot of fun and random stacks of pyramids can make things interesting as well.  This is a solid icehouse game once you find a version with the right replayability for you.

RATING: 6
Nice theme but this doesn't overcome a couple of elements in the game that don't work that well
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Looks rather simple and unispiring at first glance, but it turned out to be much trickier than I thought.
If you wanna play it good, it's not as light as it seems.
Likely to get underestimated, it turns out to be quite challenging. After 3 plays I definitely want to play it again.

one problem though: with 2 players, the hunting part does not work that well (better are 3 or 4), while the warrior part is better with 2 (king maker problem with 3 or 4). So altogether it's not ideal with any number.

Downgraded to a 7.  Really a 6 is more accurate but it gets an extra point for its lovely theme.  The game comes close to being broken with the "hide thief" card just about ruining the whole thing.  Instead of -10, it should be about -5.  Or else the buffalo cards should be weighted more to balance it out.  It seems to me it wasn't playtested enough.  I love the theme and the game has potential, but it's just not realized.

The game is not that bad.  I've played it on BSW, and it's a very light game that has some strategy.  I'm not very good at it because one needs to memorize what's been played...sorta. =)

Mixture of rock/scissors/paper and auction game. An odd mixture too. You draw your hand of 8 cards, but shuffle it and only play from 3 in your hand. Simple enough when you get it, but just too complex to be worth it for a card game. Nice artwork from Franz Vorwinkel, but a wildly over-rated game.

* Played 5+ times. Middleweight complexity. Used to think this was great, now I think it is "only" good. A bit abstract but with the right players, a neat, quick game of give-and-take card placement. Nice artork and theme, and "hide thief" card makes being greedy a no-go proposition which keeps you on your toes. With the right group, this is an 8, but could be a 5 with people who can't "get" it. I WANT THIS.

Brilliant and simple little card game. Kind of like a majority game, but deck construction and losing cards in-between round brings this to the next level. A good and quick filler.

Three hands are played - so playing with four players is a bit unfair.

RATING: 6
Play is quick and easy, but definitely not mindless.  There are enough decisions to keep the game interesting.  But the decisions are relatively quick because each player has only 3 cards from which to choose at any given time.  The game plays well with only 2 players.  I look forward to playing it with 3 or 4.

Bidding + a variant of rock-paper-scissors. Decent card game. It is also a cool idea that you are penalized if you bid too much. That rule works well with the theme somehow.

Luck-driven card game. Too long AND the game is missing all the excitement. If you want to play this kind of game I would prefer Big Manitou which is a bit better...

RATING: 7
A surprisingly neat game of hunting buffalo.  Try to capture them with your indians without overhunting (playing the highest value of indians in a turn).  Capture opposition indians so they can't be used in later rounds with your indian chiefs.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad little game.  I like the concept of playing two different games simultaneously.  It feels like of like Great Wall of China, but I prefer GWoC more.  This game just seems to have just not enough control.  But definitely not bad.

Compete over buffalo with other Indian tribes, Indians ranked in a certain order, but lowest ranked can defeat the highest ranked. Played 3-4 times and never played again. I think there is an appearance of strategy when one chooses their cards to play, but player perceptions enter the mix and influence the buffalo hunt. Last player in a round gets to play last and have the hammer so to speak.  Okay, but only for humor value. Added "squaw" to vocabulary, and neat mechanism where if one spends too many high cards capturing buffalo, they get saddled with a -10 VP card (which happened to me frequently, and someone remarked that I liked to "machinegun the buffalo".)

RATING: 8
Very nice card game. Players try to carefully balance their hand for each season, noone wants to be the overall strongest player since that means penalty of -10 (which is pretty harsh). And with the integrated rock-paper-scisor mechanics, players must simultaniously play hunting cards mixed with fighting cards, these ones able to emprison opponents' cards, worth few points, but therefore crippling the opponents' options for future hunting seasons. Great card game.

Fun card game.  A few paths to victory, either capture buffalos or rival Indians, but you are penalized for too many hunters in play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Relatively unknown, despite being one of the games on BSW. Manitou is a good little game of brinksmanship, with each player trying to push their way to the forefront of three different buffalo raids using their hunter cards, while using warrior cards to capture the hunters. There is a circularity to the ranking of the warriors which is interesting and fun. Using too high a set of hunters runs the risk of getting one of the dreaded hide thief cards, negating many of the points gained in the round. 
  Overall, this is one of the best small box card games I have seen.

Nice game involving deck-building, bluff, and risk management in two dimensions of securing the hides vs protecting the warriors.  I think the hide thief penalty may be a little harsh, but maybe that&#039;s because I always seem to end up with it!  Bloody cycles of vengeance drag the rating down a bit for me.

Having to guess what kind of strategy the opponent will use (many warriors, many hunters or a mixture) certainly makes this game interesting.

Solid, interesting choices. Slightly dry and possibly a bit boring. Still the theme is not out of place (taking the tribe out buffallo hunting.) Has an element of custom deck-building, which was quite novel for its time.

RATING: 5
I had a hard time figuring out this game.  It seems that was the funnest part.  Once I got it and the confusion lifted, I wasn't as engrossed.  So, I guess this was more a puzzle to me than a game.  Played it a few times since then, I guess I'll play it again though, if someone asks me.

I kind of like this card game more than my friends seem to.  It is very unlike any other game.  Kind of paper-scissors-stone quality to attacking, plus the acquisition of Buffalo for points.  I'm glad to have this hard to find original game later rereleased as "Big Manitou", nowhere near as much fun.

Played a few times on BSW (with 2 to 4 players). This game is quite unusual and difficult to evaluate. Some rules (most notably the penalty for highest value) make it very different with 2 players, which is probably my favorite number - but even then, I feel like I lack control (and the first player disadvantage is huge).

Completely unremarkable tile laying game akin to Carcassonne with the same problems; the game plays itself with just one tile pull.

Very similar to Carcassone... less attractive, more fiddly.

Relatief kort spel (30 à 40 min) dat toch goed in elkaar zit. 
Je trekt een tegeltje (het gelukselement) en legt dit aan in de stad Cornwell.  Daarna mag je één of meerdere mannetjes plaatsen om invloed uit te oefenen.
Als een gebied "af" is, wordt het gewaardeerd.  Dat kan door het aanleggen van een huisje, of het echt afsluiten (dat laatste is wat moeilijker).

Na waardering gaan je mannetjes naar de pub.  Je krijgt er eruit door een munt te betalen, en dan kan je ze weer inzetten.

Neat little tile layer that really had nothing to do with Cornwall, but I guess they had to set it somewhere.  Nice to try but I doubt I'll remember it in 12 months time.

Pretty poor, I'm having to say. Carcassonne with a bit of complication, but no real compelling play or scoring. Disappointing miss.

Well, luck matters a lot, but you get a set of important decisions during this game. Feels better than Carcassone. For two players probably I would still prefer Fjorde.

RATING: 7
The comparisons with Carcassonne and Fjords are obvious and apt. Cornwall stands these comparisons and has enough original elements such as triangular tiles, the possibility to place on occupied areas against money, differing strengths of the workers, recovering workers from the pub and a few other specifics to be a valid alternative for fans of the genre. Gamers denouncing Carcassonne as a boring family game should give this one a pass as well. Ok with two players, probably best with three due to the majority scoring, waiting time might get a bit long with four players.

Hmm, not that bad, but did we really need this game? Another Carc. variation, but not better I would say, just a littlebit different. Still the luck of draw like in any tile laying game, it can really make a difference.

Pleasant game reminiscent of Carcassonne.  This time, scoring is triggered by placing tiles.  I like how you have to pay to collect your workers back.  Also, the fat and thin meeples are amusing and add some strategy.  Overall, no more difficult than its predecessor and offers enough new to make it fresh, but don't know if you would need to own both.

RATING: N/A
A tile-laying game that superficially resembles Carcassonne, but here there's more competition for scoring areas and a tight economy that forces players to manage both cash on hand and the number of workers. Decidedly more challenging than it first appears. Tile draw luck might be too strong in this one for my tastes. A bit fiddly, and somewhat graphically indistinct, to boot... but there are interesting things happening here.

not terribly different from the Carcassonne experience, which I normally play as cutthroat, which Cornwall streamlines

in fact I can't be sure this wasn't an expansion to Carcassonne that instead became a spinoff

Tile laying, area control, majorities. Seems very light, not my cup of tea. Best feature is 30 minutes playing time.

RATING: 7
Carcassonne-ish affair with a couple of neat twists, but everything feels just a little bit too open with low player counts and chaotic with more. However, it's definitely an improvement over Carc in terms of flow and raw decision-making.

Pleasant enough tile laying and area control game where you generate income by matching tiles and then use that income to populate and invade terrains. This could easily have had a generic fantasy skin so the Cornish one is novel and cute and especially like how the scored workers are relocated to a pub. As with tile laying games at the end you are visually rewarded with a nice little map.

Not a bad game. But its slow and it shows how much better Carcassonne is. And tzhis comparision is apt - iuts clearly based on the game of the year, without reaching the lean elegance of it. Cornwall is much "thinkier", but still has about the same luck factor.

Wannabe Carcassonne. Really cool tiles but at the end of the day uninspired and all luck of the draw. Short enough where I would play again but I don't think it will cross the table again.

UKEXPO`16: Probably best game of the day at UKEXPO16:
Found it again - in my removals box- now to get it to the table.
18/04/17: Finally got to table again - struggled with scoring at first, but got it in the end. 
02/05/17: introduced D&D- Enjoyable game;

Cornwall is a tri-hex tile laying game with area majority scoring. Drawing a tile with a cottage is very powerful since it allows the player to force score a region, but has the option to possibly take over majority first.  However, getting a tile with a cottage is completely random due to the blind draw.  This is also true concerning tiles containing a Scottish flag which can double or triple the value of each field in a particular region.  The last place player was only able to draw one cottage tile during the game and ended with a significantly lower score.  The current rules are not explicitly clear about how scoring is supposed to work.

RATING: 5.3
It starts out as Carcassone, and ends up as a desperate search for that one still allowed place to put the card you just drew. That is, in the second half of the game you just can't make any really meaningful decisions any more, especially if there already are a lot of cottages around.

RATING: 5
For my taste it is far too similar to Carcassone. If I need to decide if we play this or a Carcassone maybe with some extension I guess I would rather play Carcassonne.

tl;dr: it's a tile laying game!

It must be really hard to make a tile laying game that's not a [thing=822][/thing] rip-off. And by that I don't mean it actually rips it off, but that it feels very much like a different take on that game. Place a tile on your turn, use your pieces to score the different features on those tiles in different ways. It's a tried and tested formula and it works well. This game just does more of the same we've seen before. And again it works well, but it doesn't bring anything new or exceptional.

Initial rating: 6.7/10
BGG scale: 6/10

Cornwall is a solid design, with clever use of money management - and where money is tight enough that sometimes a sub-optimal placement can become worthwhile if it helps generate enough money to allow you to do other things.

Unfortunately, it is too luck dependant for me and perhaps lacking in enough depth to really make me excited to play it.

Same comments as Rüdiger Dorn. Rule reading is a bit disappointing, but what a great surprise when you play it. Very enjoyable game with plenty of interaction.

GAME: Best Treehouse Ever
RANK: 1676
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My rating is based on the fact that this is a very simple game. It is what it is - but for me, it's a keeper. This game is easy to bring out with kids, and get them creating their own tree-house. If we're going by "fun factor" alone, it's more like an 8. 

This is great for families, and very portable.

RATING: 5.5
I really wanted to like this game, but there's just not enough here for the adult gamer (played it with my wife). Maybe when our son is older (6ish) it would be a good family game for us, but that's not enough for me to back it now and wait 4 years for him to get older. In the meantime, we already have 7 Wonders and Eight-minute Empire: Legends which scratch the same (card drafting) itch and play quickly, but bring a lot more choices, strategy and depth to the table.

It is really too bad, because otherwise I love the theme and the artwork.

Light, clever card game with drafting and strategic scoring modifiers.

I also dig the balance mechanic, it's simple to manage but puts just enough of a restriction on you to keep you on your toes.

Just not very interesting to me. I am getting sick of these light drafting games which rely too heavily on memory and don't offer many decisions after the drafting has taken place. Here, you just draft and play mindlessly, hoping your tree is balanced and your colors are scoring. Meh. Sold.

The art in this game is beautiful.  When done, it is fun to see what types of tree houses we ended up building.  As for the game play, it's an abstract game; connect like colored rooms to each other, and keep the tree house in balance (not too far to the left or right).  If a colored room gets blocked off, that colored room is no longer able to be built in your tree house.  One of the few abstract games I enjoy playing.

Got this for my 7 year old's birthday. She and her sister like it, but have refused to play with the full rules from day 1, preferring the beginners' rules. This does short-change us for most of the interesting gameplay, and reduces it to more of a basic hand management & placement game.

Looks good on the table, plays fast, has some interesting aspects, but not many interesting decisions and doesn't excite me.

I really like the requirements of "tree must balance" and "same-colour rooms must touch" in a drafting game, when you have an idea what's perhaps coming back and you know that you must prepare for it.  Varying constraints might be interesting. 

I find a dissonance that there are all these apparently interesting rooms in the place but they don't do anything, they're just flavour text and could all be simply coloured squares.

There are just far too many light drafting games these days for this one to find a place in my collection. It it reminiscent of Between Two Cities, Sushi Go, etc. but perhaps even simpler. The cards have no special abilities or different methods of scoring, they are simply colors, which must be placed in groups. The choices are almost never interesting and when they are, you are usually just taking a guess as to what will work. The mechanic of balancing the treehouse is thematic, but mostly just a minor annoyance rather than creating tough draft choices. No reason to play this when so many better options exist.

This is a pleasant family game that may be an introduction of the concept of drafting to some people.  The treehouse theme is unique and the "balancing" acorn mechanic makes sense.  My only criticism is that this is sort of weak for 2 players, but then again so is Sushi Go.

Pretty simple drafting game. Drafting the rooms is pretty strategic but most of the strategy comes from balancing room selection in combination with what score cards you think you'll be able to choose.

Not bad but there are so many better draft games out there... I'd play Fairy Tale just about any time over this.

Downside: building your treehouse is fun but oh so fiddly... I lost so much time on keeping my cards in their correct space.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Decent little card game involving a good bit of drafting, building a tree (house) of rooms where colors must always be touching in some way or you lose access to that color, and then a bit of fancy drafting for scoring the 6 different colors of rooms. Fun, but probably not a suggest.

Klein und unscheinbar. Ich dachte echt es sei ein Kinderspiel, aber getäuscht. Es ist ein Absacker/Aufwärmer.
Jeder Spieler baut an seinem eigenen Baumhaus. Dazu erhalten alle jeweils 6 Karten und wählen eine, geben den Rest an den Nachbarn weiter und erhalten für den neuen Zug vom anderen Nachbarn Karten (Drafting eben). Gleichfarbige Räume (es gibt 6 verschiedene Farben) müssen aneinandergrenzen und den Baum darf nicht ausser Balance geraten. Am Ende jeder der drei Runden wird gewertet. Jeder erhält für jeden Raum (Farbe egal) 1 Punkt. Aber davor werden noch Karten (von jedem Spieler eine) ausgelegt, die manche Farbenwerte verdoppeln oder zunichte machen.
Es steckt verdammt viel Geschick dahinter welche Räume man wohin baut, allerdings noch mehr welche Farbe man am Rundenende aufwertet oder zerstört.
Sehr schönes Spiel. Schon das zweite das ich haben möchte ;).

RATING: 7
Decent card picking and passing game system. The balance of the tree makes it fairly constrictive in the sense that often, you will only be able to pick one or two cards from the pack (or none) in the later stages but it is a definite hit for the family nights.

Well-loved with both adults and kids. The art is lovely, it's a lot of fun discovering all the different cards. Keeping like colours adjacent and balancing the tree makes the game more challenging than its looks make it out to be though.

Not a bad drafting game for family use. However, those "DOES NOT SCORE" cards are a sure-fire way to get hurt feelings and sour moods. Not very keen on those, or the scoring in general. But yeah, the game looks cute and is a decent tutorial on drafting.

Best Treehouse is a three round drafting game, where you attempt to build the best treehouse. You are trying to achieve a majority in a few colours to keep your scoring options open. You need to do this because at the end of each round each player gets to choose to double the value of one colour or zero the value of another. This makes for a fun game where you can't just build a treehouse all one colour. There are options to play a more simple or complicated game too. Excellent stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Occupies roughly the same space as Sushi Go with a few key differences being the addition of direct, mean scoring drafting, more rules overhead in the restrictions of what cards you can play and support for one fewer player. I enjoyed the goal cards as well. +1/2 point for the fun theme and unique cards even though only the color is relevant.

Excellent family level card-drafting game. Very little skill involved, although balancing your tree is always a little off-putting in your first game. Just a great little filler that is simple enough that almost anyone can play. Plus it's fun to brag about how your treehouse has this or that.

Replaces Sushi Go for me.

My all time favorite family game - after 70+ games I have to up the rating to 9.5. So fun and attractive. It's simple, yet if you play anticipating the scoring cards & majorities early on, you can get pretty thinky (not to mention secret objective cards). You feel you make really smart, meaningful decisions, but you still don't win the kids all too often = perfect for family game. Play it with 4 or 3 p.

I was very drawn to the artwork in this game, but just not excited enough to jump on the Kickstarter.

Good game to play with the kids and their cousins (7, 8, and 9) and still have a good time with as an adult.  Not something that I think I'd break out with my group.  Nice art - individual room art for each card is fun - and good component quality.  I don't play with the fiddly acorn balance as I don't feel it adds much for what this game is.

RATING: 5.8
還不錯的美術，每張卡的圖畫都不同，但已輕度的輪抽遊戲來說，也不算有趣。因為每輪能蓋出的五張卡片還要看運氣夠不夠好有能放置在自己樹上的顏色，若不幸沒有機會拿到，只有棄卡毫無所獲，放置卡片的條件相對於輕度遊戲來說過於嚴苛，甚至超越其他玩家級的輪抽遊戲，除了要滿足顏色相連以外還要考慮重量平衡，也因為放置的條件嚴苛，導至於隱藏目標卡和公開的目標卡基本上算是互斥的存在又更加降低選卡的趣味性，往往在遊戲的第一輪時，玩家就要決定是完成隱藏目標卡為主還是衝共同目標卡，感覺隱藏目標卡只是遊戲為了平衡共同目標卡造成滾雪球式的領先，而讓選卡比較分散的玩家有額外得到分數的可能性所加上的補償機制。另外即使是每張牌不同美術，但房間並無特殊能力，只有與美術無關的顏色有得分上的意義是比較可惜的地方。

Bought on a whim.  Very colorful.  Interesting art causes fanciful fun ...the first few times it is played.  Quickly dries and no one cares what kind of rooms they have in their tree house.  Devolves into color pattern game.  Only my youngest asks to play this still.  Scoring has interesting twist as you can eliminate certain scoring options to hinder opponents.  Wooden scoring markers are the tiniest things I'v ever seen in games...awful fiddly.

I like this drafting game for several reasons: firstly, the charming theme attracts my son to the table as he likes 13+ Storey Treehouse. The other reasons are that this is one form of drafting I enjoy: simultaneous and closed rather than the dull wait of turn based open drafting (Paris, Paris; Dream Home), unless there is a memory element involved you are motivated to take note (Ticket to Ride). I also like the maths is straightforward than Sushi Go, Fairy Tale, plus there is the placement restrictions (connecting colours and keeping the tree balanced) makes the drafting engaging.

Worst treehouse ever?
Update: From what I was anticipating. The art and theme would create a sense of building a treehouse or a home. Sims style possibly. Well that's what I was hoping for. Sadly its not even close. The balancing mechanism is a pain in the ar*e and really restricts what you can do on your turn. The cards are coloured to give some visual connection to the styles of rooms you can place but the theme is flat and does nothing for the game. This is a colourful version of card collecting at best which is a real shame. First impressions were sky high on this game but it fails in a big way. Surely someone could make this feel more like dream home.There is no sense of achievement in this game.

Pros
Short play time

Cons
A bit too simple. It needs one or two more wrinkles to take up the next level.

Update on the Con:
I think the new goal cards might add that extra wrinkle I was looking for

Other thoughts
This would be an excellent gateway to card drafting kind of game. It would work well with families and non-gamers alike.

Initial rating based on first play. 2 player basic game. Upset that I blocked one of my colors. Might be because I felt obliged to place the Board Game Room! Ok maybe not the reason but just saying ..... This game is gorgeous and fun as a light card drafting family game. Probably near Sushi Go with that regards but definitely will help kids build toward Treasure Hunter and 7 Wonders!

I haven't seen a pure drafting game in a while but this one is right up there with the likes of Sushi Go.  The theme of building a treehouse coupled with the ruleset forcing you to maintain balance as you build upwards is both cute and effective.  The result is a lightweight drafting game that always results in a treehouse you can be proud to call your own.

A great, fun, little game.  Easy to pick up, short play time, but tricky to master.  The simplicity in game play is balanced by smart strategic requirements which can really throw a wrench in your plans: treehouse balanced, player-selected scoring modifications, secret goals, and colour matching.  Don't block yourself off from your goal; keep your tree balanced or you might be forced to make a bad play; think carefully about which score modifier you take/leave.

A friend of mine brought this to our weekly meetup and we tried out a two player game. With two players it felt like a matter of figuring out how to get one more point than the other player and then just cruise to victory, and in order to do that, you just need to diversify. That's it. I'll likely avoid this, maybe trying it at a higher player count.

Tile laying draft with cards to build a treehouse where the goal is to get rooms of the same color grouped together. The catch is to build a balanced treehouse that doesn't topple the tree over.

RATING: 7
What an adorable game... and not just the great artwork!  While at its core its just another drafting filler, the spatial puzzle of keeping your sets of matching rooms able to grow while needing to balance your tree is pleasantly interesting while the player determined variable scoring from round to round is a great twist.  All the while the theme comes shining through in a Castles of Mad King Ludwig kind of way as you imagine how cool your treehouse would really be and compare its functionality to your opponent's creations.

The game does fall a little flat if people don't get into the theme and only see the colors of the rooms... but the interesting spatial and scoring mechanisms keep it a solid filler even in those cases.

Simple drafting game that's pretty fun, with very charming, imagination-fueling illustrations. In a 4-player game, all the room cards come into hands for drafting, so you can be a bit more sure of what's out there, but there's still only so much control you have, because you draft a card, then place it, draft, then place, etc. So, if you draft something plan-wrecking, you have to choose whether to chuck it (and every card until your plan works out, or you realize it's doomed), or to just change your plans. Typically, your score will be better if you do the latter.

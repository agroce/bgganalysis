I really like this game, it's like Tetris (which I love!) but with more fun restrictions! It's fulfilling to be able to pair things up even when they shouldn't be and fill those missing gaps. It's an easy game to learn and quick one to play (unless someone gets really bad AP). You always want to see if you can do better next time. There's a little bit of luck in this game - that is the drawing of card, but you all get the same luck so it's really down to how good your built your play area compared to the others. :)

Quick and tasty puzzle fun. Absolutely no interaction between the players but this time I do not mind because solitaire nature fits this game. I have a feeling, though, that over time players get fixed to their favourite solutions reducing the replay value of the game to some extent. But luckily the course of the game is not fixed so it will take some time.

Oh, and better have a pocket calculator or at least pen and paper ready, because scoring is a real pain.

A light, fast game.  Great filler, and I can see this being a lot of fun with the family due to it being very accessible and yet having replayability.

Not sure I would want to own it, though, as it's very light and analyzing it could result in "solving" the puzzle.  I have other family/filler games that the family and I enjoy, so this isn't a slam dunk right now.

Love this game! Each time it has a different way to combine the numbers, and the planning and decisons are important as you can prepare your table to get a high number in a higher level or risk and add a number in a lower level to get some points.

RATING: 7
This is the ultimate in multiplayer solitaire. There is literally no difference between single player, 4 players or 99 players. There is absolutely zero interaction, but that's OK sometimes. Sometimes you just need to sit around a table and pile up pretty shapes. 

Scoring can be a bit awkward with some mild mental maths, or a calculator needed.

RATING: 9
You have to like a few things to enjoy this game.
1) It's solitaire. What you do doesn't affect what others do and vice versa.
2) You enjoy laying tiles, although it's not the usual square tiles.
3) You feel that multi-layer tile lying is a creative thing to do.
4) You like the mix of number and shape in deciding what you do during this game.

RATING: 5
The chrome wore off this one fairly quickly, going from an neat number-based abstract puzzle to just another uninteresting abstract puzzle in only 3 plays; the charm wore off very quickly. The pieces that come out every game are always the same, just in a different order which makes the last half of the game uninteresting as you can start to predict what's coming up. Making the selection more random would have given this one a little more longevity but probably wouldn't be enough to save it in the long run. The scoring is a neat idea but there are far better abstracts out there.

Very good, simple, filler game that is right for those that like spatial puzzles. The shapes provide just enough frustration that you never feel like you know the optimal path. The end result is an attractive and satisfying pile of shapes. I've played this with a number of the extended family to good success. My father was unbeaten.

Additionally, this can double as a puzzle for toddlers. My 2-year old enjoys dumping the pieces onto the floor and putting them back into the insert.

Short thinky puzzle filler, my kind of filler! It's essentially a multiplayer solitaire but it plays very fast so it doesn't matter and you can easily play multiple times in a sitting. Components are nice colourful thick cardboards but can be quite tight fitting. The box doesn't need to be that big though, just half the thickness will do. But the insert is quite functional, just open the box and you can play it immediately.

Quick and fun 'bingo' style game that involves a little bit of spatial reasoning which is always a plus for me. Very clean, smooth and instantly engaging. There is literally no setup time needed, so a game like this serves a very particular purpose: It is a nice filler that can be played whenever you have some spare time left in a gaming session (waiting for someone to arrive, someone leaving the table to get food/etc., end of the session) or if you want to kill some time with someone entirely alien to modern boardgames. Don't expect to play this back to back a couple of times: You unpack it, play a game or two and after 20-30 minutes you pack it away until the next time.

I usually don't like abstracts but I do like this; indeed I like it quite a lot. That's partly because it's genuinely new and fresh for me, rather than something that feels like a slight variation on a familiar theme, and partly because it's so well produced that it's a joy to play. There are comparisons to be made with Take It Easy and FITS, both of which I enjoy. They share the 'everyone does the same thing every round, but on their own player board' mechanism, but this is a very different game - though it has a mild numeric aspect in common with TIE and a mild spacial element in common with FITS. Plus it can be explained in about a minute and takes 10 minutes to play, making it easy to accommodate its 'moreish' qualities. Excellent.

Excellent stacking polyomino puzzle. Simple to teach, and quick to play, but most of all, fun! Had continuously a smile on my face, and played again and again right away. Good for kids and adults alike, and it is not just dumb luck, it does have a bit of a learning curve to it to play well, mostly heuristics about how to fit odd shaped pieces. Most of the decisions are easy, but it is a great entertainment. Recommended.

As said before, an ok puzzle game without player interaction that is solved quite quickly (build a base with as little holes as possible, wait for the 7/8/9s to come to place on the higher levels. Nothing too exciting but quick clean fun. Probably not have the desire to play it often, even though it is a good filler game.

-1 Point because of the absurdly big box (70% boxed air) whilst STILL not holding the few components good enough that you could transport the box properly. Very annoying

Tetris-style game gone very bland.  It's odd how tiny the pieces are also.  Could have been 50% bigger and unfortunately the number theme and weird graphics all feels a bit forced.   Plays out like a FITS variant, but I'd rather play FITS.  It's not a bad game for what it is, but other Tetris-style games have more appeal for me.

An ingeniously designed and unique tile placement abstract puzzle filler where the pieces are in the shapes of numbers and your goal is to get the most points by stacking the numbers on different levels. The points you get are the number multiplied by the level where it's placed. A common card is drawn from the deck and everybody completes their own puzzle. Very multiplayer solitaire, but also very quick. Super easy to set up (open the box, shuffle the cards and go!), easy to learn and play, and a nice spatial challenge for the brain as you realise that the piece you thought you'd carved out a niche for just...doesn't...fit! You usually feel that you're doing horrible in this game because all the alignment is awkward and you can't flip numbers over to the dark side, but scores can be surprisingly high.
Highest Level: 3 Highest Score: 96

Very colourful and pretty on the table when the game is all completed, very light and makes a nice 'end of game night' game, but does still require some mental manipulation. The only negative I can say is that you have to be super careful when placing tiles on the higher levels as they tend to shift around. Neutral at present, but I don't know about the longevity of those cardboard tiles constantly snapping together and unsnapping. We haven't had any separation or raised edges yet, but some of those numbers can be a tight fit.

Has that 'just one more game!' kind of feeling. Highly recommended!

A simple and pleasant concept paired with great production. I'm sure they know what they're doing with the price point, though I kind of wish there were enough pieces for five or six players already in the box (of course you can buy more copies, but that's not ideal either). Since the pieces and their order are the same for everyone, much of the fun of the game is in seeing everyone's permutations, so the more the merrier. I certainly intend to use it in the school game club I run.

Update: I have found as I play it more that I'm getting better, and again it's very quick and pleasant to play. Yes, it's feather-light. But I've increased its rating a touch because it really does strike me as that nice and welcoming of a package.

Update: This was a great success in the school game club. Also, I noticed there exist goodie tiles, both unique starting tiles for each player as well as two small pieces per player that can be used when they like to fill in a small, difficult spaces. The tiles aren't worth anything for scoring but ensure that no player can properly copy another and increase the chance of reaching higher levels. Both kinds of tiles are a good idea, and Marita at Abacusspiele was super-helpful in me getting my hands on them. In passing, of course I  think that these should also have been in the base game.

NMBR9 is variation of Take It Easy that a adds the third dimension to the mix. Other than a short learning curve of how the disadvantageously shaped tiles best fit together there isn't a lot to take away from it, though. Scoring centers around the question of whether you can afford to score some decent points now and prepare the next level for big points later or whether you absolutely need to set that up right away. And the correct answer to that is given randomly...

Quick, easy-to-teach puzzle game that has players building up platforms of numbers if a number can meet two criteria: 1. No overhangs; and 2. Must overlap two numbers on a lower level. Numbers are selected according to a random card draw.

Very good abstract tile laying game in three dimensions! The rules are super straightforward and easy to teach, the box keeps everything within reach and it saves a lot of time in finding the right pieces.
What really makes the game, in my opinion, is the scoring system. The score is multiplied by how high the pieces is, so the decisions gain another dimension: time. Do I want to build it as high as I can right now, or create appropriate conditions for when the higher value pieces come out?

But I'm a sucker for "we'll see the whole deck exactly once, the only question is in which order". And this is quick and diverting, it just unfortunately reminds me of better games.

got the simple rules wrong in my first play - then got it and am loving it. Have only played solo so far. Will report back - but it's a very satisfying feeling to create this tight little structures - rewarding elegance but embracing the limitation of random draw - can see how tense this could become as you become better but still at the mercy of the draw. fun and tight and intense!

A solitaire "bingo" type game--each tile is called out randomly one at a time and everyone must play that tile in their tableau. 
If you place a tile on top of another, it MUST overlap at least two tiles and there cannot be any holes underneath. Easier said than done because all of the shapes are odd or have awkward holes in them. The tiles cannot be flipped upside down either, so you have to deal with its orientation (though you can at least rotate it).

This is a game where literally nothing will fit the way you want it to and you're always going to grumble "gah it ALMOST fits here" very often. But everyone has this problem so that makes it okay. Neat filler.

Il Tetris potrebbe reclamare qualche diritto, su questo rompicapo tridimensionale di pezzi, che vive nell'universo degli astratti. La cervelloticità è attenuata dalla contemporaneità dell'azione di "incastro", ma poiché ognuno agisce solo sulla propria "opera", l'interazione è sostanzialmente assente.

NMBR 9 features essentially no player interaction. This is the only major issue with this game, an issue that may not be a big deal for everyone. Otherwise, it's a quick puzzle game that seems deviously simple, but turns out to be very challenging (as the best puzzle games are). Fans of puzzles and shorter games should definitely take a look at this one.

Took a few plays, but this one has grown on me.  NMBR9 offers nothing that is revelatory, but it does provide an experience that is both puzzly and relaxing. That's a nice combination and, when you add in the nifty components and the fun of watching other people make different kinds of decisions, you end up with a pretty cool game.

NMBR9 is an original variation on the bingo principle used in Take it Easy or Karuba. Ruleswise, a game can't be much simpler. Placing the called number on the ground is possible without restrictions as long as it touches a number placed before. Placing it on a higher level is allowed if it doesn't cover empty spots and covers at least parts of two different tiles beneath it. After all 20 tiles are placed, each number is multiplied with the level-1.

Knowing the forms of the different numbers helps. Initially, it's likely that builds will be similar. Over the course of the game, this will change although close scores can be expected unless one player manages to build a level higher than the others. The game will slow down once only a few tiles are left. Some dexterity is necessary to not displace tiles in larger stacks. As all bingo variations, it's multiplayer solitaire. A good game when this is accepted and it's played reasonably quick.

A roll and write game, except you don't roll, nor write, yet it provides the same experience. It's interesting to watch how other players took the same actions as you, in the same order, and ended up with such different results. I also like the tile designs, which manage to always be just one square too big, or on the wrong side, and can't I just flip them over?

Overall, it's interesting, but gets old quick.

Magát az ötletet elég egyedinek mondanám. Szuper, hogy gyakorlatilag 2 perc a szabálymagyarázat, és azért van bőven gondolkodnivaló a játékban. Muszáj tervezni, lehet kockáztatni, szóval remek családi társas. A kivitelezés viszont szerintem nem sikerült tökéletesre. Egyrészt azért ezek könnyű kis kartonelemek, amiket könnyű szétlökni a próbálgatások közben, másrészt eléggé szorulnak, ha egymásba akarjuk illeszteni őket. Márpedig ez gyakori szándék. Gondolom előbb-utóbb bejáratódnak.

This game was a pleasant surprise. I was interested in it for the puzzly aspect, but some of my friends were worried about there being no player interaction.
It's quick, and simple to explain. We really enjoy this one, and if we don't have much time, or just want to unwind, this is a great option. It feels very light, and I don't find myself not being in the mood for this game, because it's quick to set up, not overwhelming, and in a way, pretty calming. The card order can be delightingly frustrating at times, but usually, you're not frustrated alone. 
After playing, we usually find ourselves just playing around with the pieces, trying to fit them together nicely.

Fun little puzzle, which is played in minutes. Goes to the same multiplayer-solitaire genre than Take it Easy', 'Don Quixote' etc. but is much faster. To get a better rating I would like to see some competition between players: for example 'who gets first tile to the second floor gets 7 extra points' etc. Or some other goals to compete. That's why I think Träxx makes things better than Nmbr9. 
Otherwise clever little puzzle game which is good choice for the gamers who want some puzzle, but not the speed elements (Ubongo-like).
But what they did wrong here is the box size which is ridiculous big: all the components fits 'Träxx' -size boxs!!!

Ein Puzzlespiel. Es müssen Zahlen gepuzzelt werden. Die Zahlen haben jeweils unterschiedliche Formen (Pixelfelder) und dürfen benachbart gelegt werden oder auch in die Höhe, wenn sie andere Zahlen verdecken und dadurch keine Lufträume enstehen.Jeder Zahl (0-9) gibt es 2 mal. Die Reihenfolge wird von einem Kartestapel bestimmt.
Am Ende Punktet jede Zahl im ersten Stock den eigenen Wert, im Zweiten den doppelten im Dritten den 3-fachen etc. Das Erdgeschoss zählt grundsätzlich als "0".

Tetris-style puzzle of combining and ultimately stacking number-shaped polyominoes to score the most points. Players simultaneously create their own colorfully arranged stack one tile at a time as indicated by the order of cards revealed from a shuffled deck. This easy to teach multiplayer solitaire game plays quickly, lending itself to repeated plays. Combine additional copies to play at higher player counts. Two small expansions add optional starting tiles and convenient filler tiles. (Pro tip: keep the punched center tiles from each zero to use in likewise fashion as the Extra Tiles expansion.)

A Tetrissy abstract where you stack tiles for point multipliers, but all tiles not at table level must not have any gaps beneath them -- and all of the foundation tiles played at table level are worth 0 points.

The game consists of 20 cards with values from 0 to 9 with 2 numbers each and corresponding number tiles of various shapes 0 to 9 with 2 tiles each.  Flip a card and get that tile.  All players place it so that it fits with other tiles but cannot overhang any open spaces and must touch at least two number if on top of other numbers.  

Level 1 is worth no points, the number on level two is worth 1 point multiplied by the number and 2 multiplied by the number on level 3.  

Game is fast and simple.  I found it mildly boring but it did have some challenge.  I prefer Take It Easy.

Quick, puzzle-y filler.  Can feel a little bit fiddly due to the nature of having to to slide parts of tiles into other tiles and some are a tight fit.  

You probably won't be able to play this 30 times/year and not got burnt out on the repetitiveness of the game.  However, you may come back to it over and over due to how relaxing it is to play and it's a slightly different puzzle every time.  Almost anybody can play this.

After a handful of plays, this has grown on me even more.  It's just really enjoyable to try to puzzle out the best placement of your tiles.  Plus, all the bright colors are enjoyable to look at!

Reminds me a lot of FITS, which we also really like.  The components here are really satisfying and trying to plan out your placement for maximum point potential is fun and sometimes frustrating.  I always love once the game gets going which everyone starts arguing about what number they need next.  "Okay, I'm ready for the 9!"  "No! I need the 1 first, or a 7 would work."  "Ugh, 7 would be awful.  C'mon 9!"

Solid entry into the "Solitaire Competitive Puzzle" genre.  Rules and concepts are a bit easier to learn/teach than the slightly more complex Dimension, but the piece shapes make it HARD to do well.

Simple rules make this multiplayer solitaire game work well for fans of spatial reasoning (others won't be convinced), but the scoring, in which number tiles are worth wildly different amounts of points, does curtail my enjoyment somewhat. It seems to too often come down to who makes the best scoring situations for their 8s and 9s. Decent, but could be better with a better scoring mechanism and higher quality components. Maybe best to discard a card or two, sight unseen, at the start, creating an element of suspense?

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]After 2017 became the year of abstracts in our house [i]([thing=230802]Azul[/thing], [thing=34297]The Climbers[/thing] and [thing=191055]Kerala[/thing] all made it onto my top 10 new to me games played in 2017)[/i] NMBR 9 was the next abstract I wanted to try, so I ended up buying a copy with the starting tiles and extra tiles promos*. Game play is simple, flip a card and place that number tile on the table or another previously played group of tiles. The higher the level of the tile, the more points the tile is worth. During the course of a game you will place two of each number tile [i](0 - 9)[/i] in the order the cards are drawn. 

I really enjoy the figuring out the spacial puzzle presented by NMBR 9 and the game is a breeze to set up and teach. It is also an extremely quick game, typically games will last under 15 minutes. My one negative of the game is that it is a multiplayer solitaire experience; I never pay attention to what my opponent(s) are doing while playing. I definitely prefer abstract games where there is some kind of player interaction, even if it is influencing which tiles my opponent can take [i](Azul can be quite nasty in that respect)[/i]. I find the game play experience of NMBR 9 I find the experience of playing NMBR 9 to be similar to roll and write games where each person is worried about how they are filling in there sheet.

However; because NMBR 9 is so easy to set up and teach it's a game that will continue to get played; it is the perfect opener while waiting for other folks to show up to a meet up or before you jump into a heavier/longer game.  

*[i]I would highly recommend the promo tiles, they really should be included in the base game. The starting tiles resolve the issue some folks have mentioned where someone could mirror their tile placement to another player. If you use the starting tiles everyone has an asymmetrical starting point. The extra tiles allow you to fill in gaps that you may have created, the catch is that they have to be played after you have placed the number tile for that round.[/i][/i]

No need to buy this one as I already have FITS filling the flip-a-card, place-the-shown-piece-on-your-tableau niche. This replaces FITS's sliding tetris feel with a "build a base and then build on top" feel, but it's all much the same. The issue I have here is that players can over-think each placement and drag everyone down. Especially in the end-game when you're trying not just to fit this piece for max points, but place it so that each subsequent piece (you know what's coming) will also fit and score as 'high' as possible. FITS doesn't bog down the same way, and I didn't feel any higher level of satisfaction for working through the nominally more complex space that this game offers. Doing away with the comparison though, I enjoy games in this niche, and its sandbox feel in a nice filler-type timeframe. This is a nice addition to the field. It's just not a game I'd pull out much - with non-gamers it's too abstract, and with gamers we're usually after something pacier and livelier in our fillers.

I had my doubts about this one, but it's quick, clever, simple to teach, pleasantly colorful, and fun. It is casual multiplayer-solitaire 3D tile laying game. Though it's an abstract, the focus is on building and scoring. Every game will be different due to the the card draws and the resulting decisions. I prefer this over most other abstract 3D building games, and over Blokus-style games. I prefer Totemo over this, but this is more Gateway-ish.

Gateway Game! Church Group Game! Casual Game! Family Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

Light/quick, solitaire puzzle. Simultaneous (bingo-draw) number tile stacking. Points based on the number of the tile times the level the tile was placed on (zero for ground floor).
Probably best as an occasional filler/warm-up; has some replayability/longevity concerns plus essentially no player interaction.

Polyominoes seem to be in right now, which suits me as I like spatial games. NMBR 9 is of the true-multiplayer-solitaire 'bingo' family, like Take It Easy and Karuba. It's a quicker teach than either of those and I enjoyed the simplicity of the premise. I'm not sure how much of a learning curve it has though - I more than doubled my score from 1st game to 2nd once I'd appreciated how important not leaving holes is.

RATING: 6
This was a fun game that plays quite quickly and is very easy to learn. The end game scoring is a bit tricky though for many. I'm good at simple math so it wasn't an issue for me, but I can see some players getting quite frustrated trying to score this. 

With all that being said I personally would be happy to play this again and think this is a nice filler. Some of the shapes can be very difficult to work with and it's quite tricky to figure out how to actually place the pieces to get the best score. With that being said there's nothing incredible here. It's enjoyable for a round or two here and there.

Technically NMBR9 is not a board game. Players receive 20 tiles representing 10 different numbers in a random order. They place these tiles in front of them, and can stack them if a tile covers at least two tiles underneath. The tiles score their value*level-1 and the objective is to get the most points. However, there is no interaction, each player simply indepedently completes the puzzle - it is a nice puzzle but it is still definitely a puzzle.

A great filler "tetris" tile placement game. The rules are simple. The game play is fast. The setup and tear down are a breeze. I only wish they'd put in enough tiles for double the players (or as many that would fit in a box that deep). You won't find many other filler weight games as high as this in my ratings.

I find this most fun single player. In the two player games that I've played we're usually thinking about how to place our tiles, so there's not much conversation happening. The game is simple but challenging and exercises the brain, although it's not exactly exciting. When I play it myself, I wish the game was longer. When I play it with other people, someone is always waiting for the others to finish. I also wish the tiles interlocked better—if some of the pieces were one block longer or shorter, it would make the game much more satisfying; a bit like Patchwork.

It is a pretty game with a nice design. The tray is also functional.

I like this one much more than I expected to. It was always pretty alluring to me, seeing pictures of the game before I knew how it worked. Then I played it and fell in love. It's a really cool puzzle, trying to figure out how to best place the tiles to give you the most surface area to go upward. It never really works out the way you want, but then once in a while you'll get a GREAT placement that makes you feel awesome. Love this one.

Played a copy from our local library. I like the game. Maybe a little too abstract, light and short for my tastes. The thing that bothered me the most were the components, though. The cardboard is really thick - but some pieces just did not fit into others. Considering that this is a puzzle game, this is a HUGE error and kept me from buying the game so far (even though it was super cheap in Germany)! The publisher assured me, that this was fixed in a later edition of the game, so I'll look for that and give it a try soon.

NMBR9 is a really great simultaneous-play puzzle game. It's pretty much set up and ready play as soon as the box top is removed, the graphic design is attractive, and any number of players can participate just by using copies of the game. The rules are simple, easy and quick to explain, and the game plays quickly. There is no player interaction, but that's not really the point of games like this. Overall, NMBR9 is a tricky puzzle that's quite fun and has just enough variability each play due to the random order that the numbers get used to keep it interesting. Love: 1, 8, 9; Like: 2, 4, 6, 7; Hate: 0, 3, 5. My personal best is currently 95.

It's a fun simultaneous play puzzle-y sort of game like Take It Easy! etc. Everyone has the same set of tiles shaped/numbered 0-9. Each round, you reveal the next card in the deck and everyone places the matching piece into their tableau. Placement rules are simple: (1) you must orthogonally touch something else on the same level, and (2) if you're building on a higher level, the tile must rest completely (i.e., no overhangs) on at least 2 tiles below it. The game ends after all pieces have been played. You score for every piece in your structure = (piece value) x (level - 1); the player with the highest sum wins!

Cool, fun, very pretty little filler. It's not the kind of game I'd seek out but I'd certainly play it again!

[ABACUSSPIELE 2017 Edition] NMBR 9 is a solid abstract game.   The game play is simple: players need to build a stack of tiles to get better score.  Easy to teach, easy to setup and easy to learn.  Just be mindful about the multiple-level building constraints.

The production is sturdy.  Thick and colour number tiles but the box is too large...

I am concerning about replayability.  Occasionally fun but not a keeper.

Wife surprised me with this one as a gift. Solid game, but it would be nice if the tiles were plastic and could lock on to the ones below (Like the Blokus tiles attach to the board). I found they slipped a lot. Of course, this would make the game much more pricey. Overall, great filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
tl;dr: fun variation on the theme

You know the kind of game: [thing=128][/thing], [thing=40393][/thing]... A card is flipped, and all players puzzle in the exact same piece. In this case you're puzzling numbers into a tableau of multiple levels. The score is the number times it's level minus one. So a 9 on the third level is a very good thing. But since you can't have overhangs and such, this is very tricky.
So, nothing new really, but a good take on the genre, and one I wouldn't mind playing again.

NMBR9 is a quick filler game with a spatial element. The numbers are weirdly shaped pieces. There's two of each number 0-9 which come out in a random order. You start by playing pieces to the table in a personal tableau. Numbers on the base level score nothing, numbers one level up score their value x 1, 2nd level x 2, etc. But you can't place a number on a higher level unless all the spaces beneath it are filled by lower numbers. Highest score at the end wins.

For a first play, I didn't really pay look at the shapes of all the numbers before starting which kind of messed me up. I would have done better if I had familiarized myself with that, but even then I would have lost horribly. My brain doesn't do well with spatial puzzle types of games, nor do I particularly enjoy them.

This isn't a bad filler... it's just not one I want to play.

This is a fun little puzzle, trying to figure out how to stack numbers together to score points. It is nifty, fast paced and quite a thrill to figure out placement. But I have to agree with most that the game likely doesn't have a lot of replayability. One sets up the base to place 7,8,9s' on the second or third tiers depending on how the numbers come out. That's it. Scores are generally close because of that. A small shift in placement is all it takes to either win it or lose it all.

Jan 2018:
Lowered rating to 6.  It's honestly more of a 3-4 for us in terms of how often we will actually want to play it, but I'm being generous since I can see where some people might enjoy it more than we do.

Previous:
This is a nice filler that requires a bit of thought.  It can feel frustrating at times when you have literally nowhere to place a high number besides on the first level (for no points), but it feels great when you manage to get anything up to a high level.  I imagine the more you play this, the better you'll get - but also the more AP you'll develop.  This is because you'll learn the exact shapes of every number and how they can fit in (or stack) with each other, which means you'll be trying to plan several moves ahead instead of just figuring out the best fit for your current tile.  Ex: If I know an 8 or 9 is coming soon, I might opt out of putting a 3 or 4 on my top level and reserve that space, so then I start thinking about where I can put that 3 or 4 to best fit a higher number on top of it.

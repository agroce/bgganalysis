Is it any good? I've enjoyed playing it, and usually did very well. No one I've played it with enjoyed it though, so are my positive opinions just winner's bias? I don't know, and it is not an interesting enough game to reach the table often enough (ever?) for me to find out.

Picked up the travel edition for change I scrounged from behind my sofa cushions, and seem to have found a nice little game for the price.  Not something I'd want to play into the ground (I like too much diversity in my gaming life) but a nice diversion nonetheless.  Plays quickly, but still requires some thought.  [Thrift $.49]

I like the strategic decisions that players are challenged to make in this game.  The game has a very difficult strategy to master, and I enjoy trying to figure it out.  The natural tendency of most players is to continue fighting for the high ground, but this can often be a less sensible move when a player would be better served trying to form squares.  It's a beautiful game to look at as well and would be my game of choice if I had one on display.

Rules were just a little confusing at first (wait a minute, what can I do with what kind of square?) but the game plays so quick that it only took a few tries for the logic of it to sink in.  We quickly started forming our own tricks and tactics to play.  With a game this short, it's not too disappointing to lose, since you can just start up another one, and another one...

Decent nim-like stacking game, but the endgame seems sort of forced. I'd like to try it without the restriction of moving a ball "up" from non-supporting positions or from the reserve to cap a square. It seems that moving a ball down from a non-supporting position could sometimes be advantageous and might lead to more interesting tactics, but I have yet to explore whether this would make the game drawish.

Like many Gigamic games, it seems to suffer from the one mistake means you lose effect. And I just really prefer games that let you come back from one mistake.

A beautiful game from Gigamic. Remarkably simple marble stacking game. Be the one at the top of a pyramid. Only two rules. Has been solved, but no memorisable sequences have emerged yet. Very short, very re-playable. Everyone I show this game to loves it. It is fun to watch people start to realise strategy. Second player may have an advantage here, first player has to "break serve" in two senses of the word. However, some interesting caveats have emerged through my study of the opening. This game seems to have sparked a whole line of design research through Cameron Browne's "Shibumi" system. It is an open question to me at least what the "quintessential" game using this system might be. Perhaps "Spline". I plan to write up some Pylos strategy soon.

It's pretty, but the game is underwhelming. For a short game, there is not enough of a look-ahead element. It's also not a very intuitive kind of game, so maybe that's why, despite it's short length and prominent position beside my dining room, it is difficult to get it to the table.

A very nicely designed 3D pyramid abstract game.  This is a somewhat decent filler.  After repeated plays I can very much feel its limitations. I have played just over a half-dozen times in the past few years and always enjoyed the style of play, but the options are limited and there's not too much room for skill. It's one of those abstracts where the first player to screw up invariably loses. I still regard it as a great coffee table game!

The greatest abstract strategy i know so far. You must think ahead in the whole game, one single mistake and you will be seeing yourself as the looser easily. Your one and only goal is to be on the top of the pyramid. I used to play it a lot on BoardGameArena very fast, can be very brain killer but hell of a good fun. The advanced rules is the best addition ever the one you have always been dreaming about.

Pros / Cons:
-Nice quality wooden components, nice feel
-Clever game mechanics with very easy rules yet super hard strategy.

-It was fun for about 200 online games, but after you have fount the winning strategy it becomes monotone and boring.

A good-looking 2 player abstract. If you play it casually it falls into the "I didn't see that" category, so in spite of its inherent 'lightness' concentration is essential. Use handicaps if playing against children: let them take 2 pieces back, you take 1. Attractive enough to leave on display.

Too Nim-like a game for me the game is all about making a play that forces your opponent to create a platform for the next level. It also feels that good play is obtainable through a small amount of analysis. While I know it has a large game space it's almost certainly full of stupid moves.

A nice table game that has a couple of levels of play, but no real drama or sense of achievement.

This ball stacking game is a struggle of tempo, with pattern and parity being tools you use to get ahead in that struggle: the balls of both players complete the pyramid; the player who plays the last ball on the top wins; therefore, slow down your own rate of placement; but avoid losing board control in the process. Feels markedly more [i]designed[/i] than some other pyramid-based n-in-a-row games. The Gigamic all-wood versions also look very nice.

DISCLAIMER - THIS IS THE GAME THAT GOT ME INTO ABSTRACTS AND BOARDGAMES AGAIN.

I give this game such a high rating partly as I admit I do see it through rose-tinted glasses but also through gaming logic.  It succeeds in what it sets out to do.  It is a quick basic abstract which has a surprising level of stategy within a simple concept but due to the speed of play does not suffer from analysis paralysis and quickly becomes competitive with all types of players.  From a cold sterile look at the game ok it may only justify a 7 or 8 but after 100 plays with friends, flatmates and family it prompts many happy memories and certainly some great nights.  If you like long heavily themed games stay away but if you want a quick five minute game to decide who does the washing up this is worth a look.  Little note if you do decide to buy go for the travel version as the more expensive version add nothing to the experience.

Like [i][boardgame=30179]Inside[/boardgame][/i], Gigamic's other pyramid stacking game, [i]Pylos[/i] is pretty and satisfying to handle. Likewise, it's not deep, but it's not uninteresting, either. In contrast, these rules have more exceptions, it's possible to repeat positions (a minor annoyance solved by blocking), and setup is invariable.

I shelved this after a couple dull first plays, but positive reports on BGG encouraged me to try again. I'm glad I did.

RATING: 7
With its goal of topping a pyramid built during the game (i.e. being the last player able to move), Pylos is a not too deep but not too light abstract that offers a very easy start and increasingly tougher decisions each time it lands on the table. Some stalemates might occur, but unless players stick to a strategy to be followed at all cost they don't come up too often. 

Pylos' travel version is recommended as it's perfectly portable while keeping the gorgeous tactile quality usual in Gigamic games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Astratto, in stile Quarto, Quoridor, Batik ecc. Il gioco è carino e strategico, ho riscontrato il difetto che alcune partite potrebbero risultare quasi interminabili per movimenti ripetitivi dei giocatori visto che ad ogni quadrato creato si possono rimuovere due bocce. Tra i vari 'classici' astratti è quindi quello che gradisco meno. Come sempre i materiali di legno sono molto belli.

The feel is very reminiscent of the Gipf games, where you're setting up situations to reclaim pieces, and your opponent tries to stop it and set up his own, knowing that the first player to run out of pieces loses. This implementation seemed too straight-forward and run-of-the-mill by comparison though, not providing the look-ahead complexity and shifting board that provides the Gipf games their allure. Lovely components and a short time frame do make for a nice coffee table game though if you're into that kind of thing.

Very strategical understimated game. Try this, if you haven&#039;t. As an abstract game is very quick and has got a nice 3D system, it&#039;s easy to explain but has got plenty of strategy to learn. And its linear design makes one of my favourite &quot;furnishure&quot; games: it gets immediate attention from hosts and the wooden pieces are great.

Got this game in exchange for illustrating the kindle version of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle.

Had to replace the men after mice stole the originals. (The Mini uses 7/8" wooden balls.)

My wife and I like this one, and it is pretty and satisfying to build.  There is a slight flaw that arises once in a while: there can be loops where each person's best move leads to an infinite loop.

Very nicely done, but feels a bit shallow. It's nice to feel those wooden marbles. Good entry level game for a quick session.

There's a hole in the rules that essentially make you stuck in an infinite loop if performing the same moves.

After seeing it and for some reason not being interested for many years, I finally played it in the logical games tournament at [[Pionek]] 2008-11-29 and was impressed.  Interesting elegant game!

Now we own it (as of Christmas 2008) and play it a lot.  It's short enough that we want to play "just one more".  It  [i]seems[/i] so simple, yet often surprises.  The strategy remains subtle and nonobvious as I keep losing more than my fair share. :)

A VERY quick perfect-information abstract with nice components (great wooden balls!) and a coffee-table look. Where's the iDevice app?

[q="drunkenKOALA"]The board is a 4x4 array of dented holes. There are 15 black and 15 white balls. Using the board as the base, a 4 level (4x4, 3x3, 2x2, 1x1) pyramid is built as the game progresses. 

On each turn, a player can either 1)place a marble from his reserve or 2)relocate one of his balls on the board to a higher level. Balls can stack on top of others only if it is being supported by 4 balls. A ball that is supporting another ball cannot be moved. 

Whether it be by placing or relocating, if you form a 2x2 square or an orthogonal line that spans the first or second level, you get to (and must) remove 1 or 2 balls of your own from anywhere on the board (except those supporting other balls). 

The player to place the top ball and finish the pyramid wins. [/q]

Simple stacking abstract where the player to cap the pyramid wins. Completing squares and lines of your own colour allows removing balls, and balls can be moved to a higher level rather than placed from the supply -- as by definition the player to cap the pyramid is the player last to place, it's quite transparent that whomever does this the most will win. The trick is removing balls without losing too much influence or control over tempo in the process.

In theory this is the sort of thing I like (simple, fast playing, free placement rapidly becomes claustrophobic) but in practice play feels a little too constrained. It's certainly not worth playing without the advanced variant. 

Aesthetics matter and it's the most beautiful of all the beautiful wooden Gigamic games.

RATING: 6
[Gigamic wooden travel (1994) edition] {Abstract; spatial} {5 basic rule, 6.5 advanced rule} Among the abstract games, Pylos is unique for its 3D appearance. It's quite light; after the players get used to the 3D modeling in their mind, the difficult is not much different from other games from Gigamic. Nevertheless, it's a very good filler for children and a couple. It should be only played with the advanced rule. The basic rule is just so-so. It's quite balanced; so far I didn't see any advantages to be the first player. A problem of Pylos is that it's difficult to make handicap for different levels of players.

Formation of the ground and first level is important and it usually determines the winner. I don't mind having more 'balls' at the ground level. In most of my games, it seems the center of the first level is more important. 

Pylos looks really elegant and cool for its wooden pieces. The final pyramid can be used as for decoration in home as well :laugh: 

[Update] Gigamic has released a new edition, of which the bits are plastic with black and white color. This is very ugly. I am glad that I have the classic edition.

RATING: 5
This is a decent abstract game that manages to capture a different sort of "set up a move to lead your opponent into another move that will set you up for a good move two turns from now" game.  It has some nice tension and some clever tactics for folks who are good at visualizing games that way.  I'm not always good at it (especially in three dimensions), so it's probably not the best game for me.  Still, it's a quick game with a satisfying feel, and I wouldn't be opposed to playing it again.

I've found that kids love this. I started playing it with my oldest daughter when she was 5, and my younger daughter started playing it at 3 1/2, but only with the basic rules.

Personally I find the game great looking, but a bit dull. If played correctly the start player has an enormous advantage.

This game makes you think. I like the strategy, it's sort of like a 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe, in some ways, trying to create blocks of your spheres to control the board. It's also very pretty.

Elegant pure strategy game.  It is much more interesting to play than a casual glance would indicate.

More tricky than it looks...very beautiful, as always with Gigamic.

Very good theme with some of the observations being chillingly accurate. Fairly simple and fun. You need to provide your own dice and some way to keep score. I use both tokens and a score sheet so everyone can see what everyone elses score is.

Appreciated the humour and theme but to me, gameplay-wise, it was basically a play-whatever-I-draw game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite of the Chez Geek family.  Adds to the Chez line with more strategy.  The dynamics of People are improved with the Gloom mechanic, which makes it desirable to have unwanted company.  Gotta love them Goths for their sense of humor!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Chez Geek in a Goth setting.  Same basic set, with some new rules pertaining to gathering Gloom which is a slack alternative.  Very funny in it's own right, this one is dependent on the crowd you are playing with.

Slightly more amusing than Chez Geek which I also own due to the added Gloom.

Sounds like soooooooooooo much fun but if your not going to "role play" the cards don't bother playing.  Just looking at the funny cards is the best laugh you will get. And I am a D&D player. The only other game I have rated so low is Monopoly.

I picked this up for $12 not expecting much, but found it much more fun than than the base game Chez Geek (which is not required for this).  I'm not usually a fan of cardgames, but this is probably my favourite filler game and I find it appeals to a wider audience than Chez Geek.  It's doubtful that it will ever get a reprint, so grab a copy before it disappears.

Played once.  Like Chez Geek, this is not a strategy game, but mindless fun.  You must be able to "get into character" and visualize yourself living together with a bunch of friends in order to enjoy this.

RATING: 6.1
The best geek in my opinion. The most ballanced, but with less humour than the origional. If you are a goth though, it would be far funnier.

Fun little beer & pretzel style of somewhat quick game with a different theme from the Chez Geek. Still fun though with the theme, like many other games like Munchkin, this version might be better with people who can have an appreciation for the theme & a sense of humor.

The humor isn't as spot-on as it is with the other pieces of Chez Geek IP, though its pretty good. The "gloom" mechanic doesn't add much to the game and doesn't feel like it integrates that well with the Chez Geek core game.

The theme of this Chez (Insert Theme Here) game is even funnier than the others.  If there's a subculture that was meant to be goofed on, it's the "Goths".  The gloom mechanic is a nice touch.

Work at your dreary job. Spend your hard-earned money and precious time to accumulate Slack points... or collect Gloom when life turns against you. As it will! You can earn Slack for buying Clothes, Shinies, and Booze... or you can just Cough, Complain, or even Faint Dramatically, especially if you have an audience. And if you get very lucky, there might be some Graveyard Nookie in your future.

Chez Geek themed around the Goth.  It's 2 minutes of fun packed into 45 minutes of play.  It's really brain-dead and I don't see many occasion where we would play this over basically anything else...  but the theme is cute.  Owning this is more of a social statement than anything else.

Stored in the Block Party box, which is in storage.

I used to play this game with friends in my twenties. We always talked about playing a game where we were "working while in college" that meant we had a major and a job. We never actually got around to playing the game. When I moved away from that group of friends I bought all the sets with the intention of trying to play that game. Instead I started playing different board games with a different crowd.

I have never actually played the original chez geek, but from what I understand this plays really similar except it adds the goth flavor, and it adds gloom points in additional to the usual slack points. A fairly light card game.

RATING: 8
It's interesting.  In Chez Goth, there seems to be a much greater emphasis on things that cost money - very few of the activities are free.  Basically, if you have an income of 2 or below, Goth becomes essentially unplayable (despite that being the majority of the jobs; hey, they're goths!  Maybe they're *supposed* to be miserable!)  In Chez Geek, however, most activities are free - it's just finding the Free Time to make use of them that's the problem.  It means the emphasis becomes a little different.

Same as chess geek: "better than Munchkin", but I miss the goth stuff. Probably the designers aren't in goth and made just a few jokes from media stereotypes. As a "retired old school goth", I could think a lot of jokes about "being goth" that would fit well in the game.

It's Chez Geek, but this time you're a household of gloomy goths. Can be played as a stand alone game, or you can shuffle it up with the original game for a stranger mix of cool stuff, activities and friends liable to drop in and party.

[SJ Games 2004 edition] {Beer&Pretzels, Goth; utility card, variable-player-powers; optimal 4-5p} Bought it from a FLGS when it's on sale. I bought it because I like the Vampire theme. It's a revised Chez Geek but with similar themes and mechanics. It's a good lunch game to pass time or have a break after serious games.

My comments from Chez Geek pretty much carry over here.  The only new mechanic--gloom--rarely came up for us when we played, as we combined Goth with Geek and that tended to water it out to a large extent.

Chez Goth Blends well enough thematically with Chez Geek.  The Goth jobs may be slightly more difficult because their elevated slack goals depend on the availability of gloom points, which are diluted when using this as an expansion.

This version of the Chez Geek Empire is a hoot and the Gloom mechanic is an excellent addition.  I would though suggest not mixing this with Chez Geek due to the Slack Goals of Goth are higher than Geek because of Gloom and make the Goth jobs pretty crappy.

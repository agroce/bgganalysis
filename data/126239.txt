What a piece of turd. A total toilet. Programming games are fun in general but those games have something in common. You cannot fully anticipate everything. They also move fast. 

Twin Tin Bots is super slow and all too predictable to be any fun. This is because you're making only small changes to the program each round. This results in long stretches of time when nothing interesting happens. And this waiting is what ruins the game. Hate it. Not the worst experience I've ever had but close.

If you're a fan of Roborally or programmed move games, then this is likely a title that will appeal.  It's playable by several players and plays within an area that is small enough to ensure interactions.  It's different enough from other programmed games to be worthy of note.  There is definitely some skill to planning, but its a game that players will likely get better at due to experience alone vs. developing deep strategies.  There is only a slight bit of luck in the special powers that a player has.  If the right (or wrong depending on point of view) comes into play, a player can really mess up another to point that the game feels very lopsided.  Luckily enough, this is not at all common.  The biggest draw back to this game is honestly the price tag.  Its pretty expensive for the game.  At half the price it would be a easy win.  But at its retail point, it's a bit steep for what it is.

Simple pick up and deliver robot game, I would much rather play Roborally.

*update* After a few plays I would remove the word "much" in my previous assessment, have uprated it because you do get lots of chaos and the "zap" feature is rather fun.

RATING: 6.5
Es un juego de programación. Cada jugador tiene una tablilla que actúa como doble spool de instrucciones para manejar dos robots. En cada turno, puede añadir una instruccion al spool, intercambiar dos instrucciones del spool, eliminar una instruccion o vaciar el spool. Después de eso, se ejecutan todas las instrucciones para ambos robots de izquierda a derecha.
El objetivo es recoger cristales de tres colores y puntuaciones diferentes y llevarlos a tu base. 
El juego es un poco incómodo de jugar, porque realmente es muy dificil controlar simultáneamente a los dos robots, cuando sólo puedes añadir una instrucción a uno de ellos, lo que hace que el juego sea bastante caos.
Es muy bonito. Por lo visto, salió de un kickstarter que no funcionó bien, y el juego lo liquidaron.
El juego está bien, pero le falta algo.
Para pasar el rato, aunque hay opciones mejores.

RATING: 6
The tension for this game is how to program two robots simultaneously such that they are both being used effectively when you can alter their programming so little every turn.

That part of the game is great fun. Seeing your two robots run their programs, popping crystals into your base is really rewarding.

However, the way the game works, once you establish a pattern, you want to just ride it out until the game ends, but you aren't really making any decisions any longer, which isn't really all that fun. Fortunately, these patterns run so quickly that the game ends soon after.

Or does it?

And this is where the game loses a lot of my interest. 

This game has interaction the results of which are very difficult to predict. When someone knocks you around or zaps you, it throws off your entire pattern and you have to fix your programming to get back on track.

When it happens once or twice, it's a challenge. If it keeps happening, especially before you can right your patterns, then you get the sense that it's interfering with the fun part of the game.

The chaos of programming bot movement has never been more goofy when even your programming powers are limited per turn. That being said, with only two players, this game ends up just being a simple exercise in being able to plan several moves ahead to make your limited actions timed effectively.

With more, the game probably shines but also probably ends up being way more chaotic and random. Not my thing.

Twin Tin Bots is a really cool game. I still cannot decide whether I prefer this game or Robo Rally. Robo Rally is more tactical, while this one is silly and chaotic. Two different beasts that both deserve a place on my shelf.

RATING: 7
A less chaotic cousin of Robo Rally, although our five-player game *felt* much more chaotic than it really was. Rating is sure to adjust up or down with more play. This is clearly not for folks who aren't into programming/ puzzle type games (I am, but some of my friends are not).

Most of the cardboard components are OK, but the paper tore on a few when punching them out. Nothing so bad as to require replacement, though. The bots are made of hard brittle plastic -- I would have preferred smaller bots of softer, more resilient plastic. I'm thankful for the very sturdy box and insert.

The tiny stickers are hard to apply, barely noticeable, and look ugly. I gave up after putting them on two or three bots. Printing them with a clear background instead of white was a mistake. Thankfully, facing is not an issue with these guys (unlike the Robo Rally figures), so the stickers are unnecessary.

I thought of a house rule that was well received by the other players: Once everyone has used his double move tile, everyone gets to retrieve it and use it again. It still won't get used more than a couple of times, but an extra shot may mitigate some of those situations where you realize that you're going to be stuck for a few turns and fall behind.

Like Robo Rally, this game seems to have a tendency to outstay its welcome.  Both games seem fun and exciting at first, but as the exercise stretches on the smiles become more forced, and the activity starts to seem like work.  I really like the clever constraint of only getting to work on one robot per turn, which forces either inefficiency or brilliance.  And I quite enjoy the activity, for a time.

Provisonal rating based upon one play at Essen 2012, and a very personal one in view of my comments.

Not my personal style of game.

This pick-up-and-deliver game is very similar to Robo Rally, but each player controls two robots, and only one robot's programmed instructions can change each turn.  Any success depends on careful planning, but the board is small enough that players will be constantly getting in each other's way and potentially even stealing gems from each other. It's pretty good, but I prefer Robo Rally where there's more going on and more direct conflict between robots available.

Kind of the more thoughtful cousin of RoboRally. I'm not actually sure it is much less chaotic because while information is open and you can plan your own turn exactly, the interaction with other players' robots can easily wreck your plans again.

The real challenge, of course, is simultaneously getting both of your robots to do useful things given the harsh contraints of the programming phase. Twin Tin Bots is also quite a bit more static and it takes much longer to switch gears and abandon failed attempts. As such I feel like I enjoy the idea of the game more than actually playing it.

When I heard about this game's premise I was very excited to play it. The simultaneous programming of two robots to achieve some amazing choreography seemed like it would be glorious. However what ended up happening is everyone concentrating on making good use of one robot while letting the other repeatedly bump into a corner. This completely invalidated the main draw of the game.

Unless you have genius levels of forward planning capabilities you're simply much better off plyaing Robo Rally

Probably my new (2014-01-01) favorite game. I Kickstarted this one (twice!) because I love programmed motion, and it didn't disappoint, turning out even more fun than I expected, with plenty of opportunity to screw up other players. The only question is how much strategy you can really build up in a game where each player has such a wide range of motion -- so it's a little light, but still an instant classic in my opinion.

I helped the editor to demonstrate this game at the "Paris est ludique" fair last year. The game is really good and innovative (not just a Roborally copy, far more than it).

Programming 2 robots at once seemed chaotic to me at first sight, but experience proves that it's a pure "brain-damaging" game.

I really hope to see it in store soon!

A not bad programming move game, some lovely ideas somewhat letdown by short game play and a limited player interaction.

With all the hype surrounding this year's Mechs vs. Minions, Twin Tin Bots should be given a second look. The principle of successively programming robots is similar in both games. The unique feature of Twin Tin Bots is programming two robots simultaneously while only being allowed one change per round. In contrast, the programming in Robo Rally changes completely each round.

Twin Tin Bots has two disadvantages. The components are sub-par, not to mention the outstanding component quality of Mechs vs. Minions. Moreover, setting up the program of the tin bots is a slow affair. To achieve a goal players need to think a few turns ahead and have to cope with a few lost moves on the way. The inherent inertia of the bots will annoy some players. Mechs vs. Minions has randomness in the cards but offers more action and speed in a cooperative environment. Twin Tin Bots is a good choice if players like the programming to be more challenging.

Wit 5 it felt a bit cramped (and the 6 player board is the same size). It was an interesting take on programming bots, since you only change one thing a turn your programs stick around a bit. But it's very easy to have a couple turns in a row where you effectively do nothing. Perhaps if the board had reprogram stations where if you run over it you can change one extra tile for the following turn. 

I'd like to give it another go, but it's not on my purchase list anymore.

There are a couple of things that bug me about this game. The first is the negative interactivity where a player can do suboptimal moves for themselves just to dick you over while the other players being left in peace can get on with scoring points. With so little change allowed to your programming each turn it can take a lot to recover from a zap or a push, often a game losing amount of time. This would be forgivable if the player screwing you over was the winner but typically it will be someone else. I'm not a fan when in game scrapping by 2 players prevents either of them winning. To me that is not a fun element when added to a game.

Secondly I don't like the rules around the spawning of new crystals. It is possible to set up a conveyer belt between your 2 robots and the spawning ground and to suddenly accelerate the game to an end. You could argue that this is skillful play from any player who sets this up and it is, but in combination with my first issue why someone may have screwed your programing it prevents there being anywhere enough time for a recovery. Personally I'd prefer some randomizer within limits to determine where new crystals spawn.

When it comes down to it I see very little fun in this game and with a huge helping of frustration dumped on top it what fun there is gets smothered.

Players have a pair of robots which they preprogram to move and collect crystals. Each robot has 3 slots to program, and the trick is that you can only change one order on one robot. The orders are rotate, move, collect gems, etc. First player to collect a certain value of gems wins.

I have a few beefs about this game: 1) There is no balancing factor for players going last in the turn order. 2) It can be chaotic with more players. 
At least it isn't a long game. The one game I played, the first player won by only using one robot. His second robot only had 1 order the whole game which kept one of my robots trapped on the side until I  could get rid of it. There is too much luck for my taste and it is not my type of game. 

The game doesn't seem too much different than RoboRally. Sure you can argue in RoboRally you program all your moves, here you only change one move at a time.

A game I have avoided for a while since I didn't think I would enjoy it. It is programming and I am not the best at that. The pieces are charming and I like the puzzle/mind game it presents but you can not account for other players. It will be very frustrating for many. It is not a game I would play a lot, but I could play it occasionally. Not really my thing.

This is a good programming game, but it feels like the chaos that they wanted in the game is chaos for chaos sake, not a good controlled chaos that you control.

One 6-player game. A bit too busy for the first game. Awareness of what the other players can do is possible but way too much work for such a light silly game. Also, players fighting it out just doom each other but lack-of-awareness of the 'leader' and fighting that player gives the game away. RoboRally is better with the secret programming.

A better, faster alternative to Robo Rally. Less maddening, for sure. I love the robot figures and jewels. Simple to learn and teach, and there's even some variants to include for some more advanced play or just a change of pace. I recommend using portals, since they discourage players from trapping each other in the corners of the map. Overall, Twin Tin Robots has been one of the bigger surprises this year. I didn't even know what it was until I spotted at my FLGS, but it was a must have after I tried it.

What an absolute stinker of a game... I really feel sorry for whoever bought this game.

I get that it's got robots and that would be enough to shift enough units of any crappy game you could build around that, but really? from the guy who made Smallworld?

Since I am a programmer I like programming those bots. Its a challenge to make them both do meaningful things while you may only change the program of one of your two robots. In spite of the 10 robots in our 5 player game, the game was not so chaotic. A player may need some thinking time when it's his turn, but the other players may use the time to think about their moves already.

When I played with three players I found it's a bit difficult to predict what will happen. I would need a lot of time to think everything through. There are too many change factors to concider.
I most enjoy this game with two players which makes prediction easier. And it's more fair bacause in 3 player game the third player profits when the two others fight.

Update: I've implemented this game for yucata.de. I've played a lot of games and still enjoy it. I prefer two player games on the big board with advanced rules (mud, teleports, blobs, rocks).

(private note: Traded with Robert for Mage Knight.)

Interesting ideas but frustrating gameplay.  I like the slowly-shifting-program approach, where you have to plan ahead and make weird moves as you shift your program.  However, some other elements of the game kill it for me.
(a) downtime, especially with larger games.  A puzzly turn-based game should not go to 6 players.  I'm not sure it even really supports 4 players.
(b) chaos and lack of planning. For a game that is all about subtlety and planning, there isn't much opportunity for planning because the board changes so much between turns.
(c) spiteful interaction.  There is a lot of back-and-forth of players grabbing crystal from each other, while a third person operates smoothly in an unoccupied region.  Everyone is stuck in a Nash equilibrium, but one person is cleaning up.

--Jan2014-- Quite cute.  I like the presentation, and the gameplay isn't too bad either.  I've only played with 2 and 4 players, and the 4p game was preferable:  not much longer to play, and loads more (amusing) interaction.

Game that seems likely to have been developed as "RoboRally for strategy gamers". Each player has two robots with three slots each for commands like "move forward one space", "rotate left in a hex" and "pick up a crystal". The aim is to collect crystals and deliver them back to your home base. Unlike RoboRally's timed programming, here is that players can only partially reprogram a robot. It's possible to completely remove all commands, but new ones can generally only be added at a rate of one per turn. This generates the same kind of muddle as RoboRally as robots execute commands that made sense a turn ago but now causes them to walk into a wall.

I'm not a fan of RoboRally, and Twin Tin Bots does have less chaos and the smaller scope of changes in theory limits AP. In practice, it is still time-consuming if players take the time to consider what others' robots will do. It's also frustratingly slow; the glacial pace of command changes makes it a chore to get anywhere or do anything. Play also becomes more reactive with more players -- it's much harder to set up an opportunity to steal a crystal than it is to have one fall into your lap -- so I'm not sure it's that much more strategic.

BGG opinion on player count is split as expected. It works quite well as a 2p abstract (maximum strategy). There is more chaos at higher player counts, depending on your tolerance for that kind of thing.

It doesn't quite work for me but but it's probably the best spatial-programming game out there.

Played a prototype at Essen 2012. Felt like a more controlled/ less chaotic version of Robo Rally. Has certainly more depth, and even more interaction. For my taste, it was just a little bit too brain-burning. And of course, hilarious weapons and factory equipment are missing.

Much more strategic and less chaotic than RoboRally since almost everything is open information, and each program changes only one (or once per game, two) instructions at a time. The only hidden info is a very small number of special instructions you can use in your programs. I really love this game after two plays--basically the game I wish RoboRally was!

In the first game, with no obstacles, I exploited a trick where I could just sit and rotate next to my base picking up newly dropped crystals from near the center. In the next game other players were more aggressive about using their bots to break this up and things were very dynamic and interesting.

Update: Still playing this game once every few months, 4+ years later. Still love it. It's been a hit with programmers and non-programmers alike. Runs a little long sometimes, but otherwise no complaints. Surprised by the ho-hum rating on BGG.

Played the prototype at Spiel. It was fun. The comparison with Robo Rally is obvious, though this plays 'nicer'. It's not easier though, keeping track of the movements of two robots is difficult. It's a good thing they can't die.

You have two robots with three programble actions, but you can only change one action each turn. That's of course the challenge of the game, but it feels very limiting to me.

2014-04-02: First impression:  Brutally difficult and utterly unforgiving system, but delightfully challenging.  The slap-each-other-around direct conflict feels a little too powerful for having so little ability to compensate (one change per turn, total, for both robots).

2014-04-03: Playing this real-time makes it much more satisfying.  I think it is a mistake for the 2p setup to have the bases straight from the middle.  Both 2p and 3p allow you to chain your two bots from the center, and just pass the crystals along to your base.  It's very satisfying to do, but chances are that if I am aligned to do this, you're scattered to the wind, and can't stop my well-oiled victory machine.

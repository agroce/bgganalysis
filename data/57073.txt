Pretty abstract game.  This is nowhere near the classic Avalon Hill game in terms of history -- which is kind of sad, when you realize AH made their game 50 years ago and used a few pages of rules.

Being able to play solitaire and over VASSAL are big pluses, as well as playing numerous battles from 1942 (and being able to replay a mythical battle from the movie [i]The Final Countdown[/i] is kitchy.
The components are gorgeous.  The rules are extremely easy.  There is no excuse for not knowing how to play the game: a) The rulebook is very easy (and is laid out in chronological order of a turn) with many graphics and examples; b) There is an example game: step-by-step included, and c) The online support on the BGG forum is excellent.

The game play is original and refreshing.  However, it is a bit on the long side and tedious and that takes away from of the enjoyment.

Superb game with easy rules. The cards and graphics look great. Atmosphere is tight. Fighting is fast and furious. The strategic map-movement with the random low clouds and squalls makes room for tactical maneuvers. 

Here is a little AAR of one of my plays to illustrate what i mean:
"Finished the Midway scenario solo. Got hit hard in the first turn. I took two of my carriers into a squall to hide and repair. On the third turn i took 'em back out and counterattacked. Meanwhile in the second turn: a Midway strike force managed to scratch two of the Japanese carriers and my third carrier managed to survive under low clouds on it's own. One scratched Japanese carrier got crippled and the other sunk due to a bunch of follow-up explosions. After the attack my two carriers maneuvered out of the squall in turn three and i hit two of the three Japanese carriers still in play. Again, after a couple of follow-up explosions one more got crippled and the other sunk. Because of that the Japanese lost a lot of planes in addition to the carriers, which finally brought me to 11 victory points and i won."

Solo rules by the designer are downloadable.

Un par de partidas no registradas.

Juego de cartas simple y poco realista con el hecho histórico que trata de representar. Podría ir de otro tema y funcionar igual.

Como simulación sin duda es un fracaso absoluto con una serie de reglas y mecánicas que no logro explicar (¿ampliar la autonomía de los aviones con posibilidad de dañarlos? ¿si te quedas sin aviones puedes recuperar uno de la pila de muertos?). 

En general se trata de un festival de jugar cartas y tirar dados donde la estrategia a seguir (que tampoco es que sea muy elaborada) está tremendamente influenciada por la suerte. La campaña tampoco es que tenga mucho sentido más allá de ir jugando batallas en secuencia e ir sustituyendo los portaaviones eliminados por otros.

Como juego para pasar un rato, puede valer, pero si buscas profundidad, detalle o historicidad este no es tu juego. A mi me cansó muy pronto.

En su parte buena, las cartas y componentes son coloridos y dan un aspecto visual llamativo. Pero no nos engañemos, esto NO es un wargame.

Original, creative, evocative.  One can almost smell the smoke, feel the heat of burning ships, and sense the vibration in your seat from a shot-up plane trying to make it back.  The action starts very fast and is very absorbing.  Hoping to see the designer take the intensity into the '42 night surfact actions.  Hot stuff!

I have played the Solitaire version of the Midway game a few times.

Pros:

Based on my very subjective opinions I like the game.  The Solitaire version appears to work.

Cons:

I have limited playing space so I normally avoid any games which employ two or more standard (22x34")mapboards.  This game requires a playing area of at least 3x4 feet.  If I had known this, in spite of my positive feelings, I  would not have purchased the game.

I think I like this more than Hell of Stalingrad, which is saying something because I love Hell of Stalingrad.

Thematically strong, the mechanics match the actions really well, and the desperation is palpable.  With four scenarios in the box, you get a fair amount for your money

This is one of my favorite two-player games.

RATING: 7
One play; not bad. Not totally sold yet either, but it's a fun knock-down, drag-out simulacrum of carrier warfare. It's not that authentic, but it gets a good feel, and there is definitely a game here unlike in the Hell of Stalingrad debacle. Worth another play, which I was not sure it would be. Still conflicted on a number of things - it's a little procedural, a touch over-complicated, and the pacing isn't great for the number of decisions you make. But still, there is enough to like here for it to be worth a few spins.

The graphics are loud but they work for me - you're never in doubt of the important information. The rulebook is dicier, though - it's a fairly simple game but not well explained.

Update 12/18/10 - We started a campaign and it seems to work rather nicely. I am enjoying the game even more now. We could not find a FAQ though to answer some things that had come up. I do hope they put one together.

---

I was wondering how they would port the game mechanics that gave you a sense of the meat grinder effect of the Battle of Stalingrad to carrier battles in the PTO. Well, the designer figured a way and it seems to work pretty well. Still, I think I prefer The Hell of Stalingrad a little more. Good stuff!

Pretty good abstraction of just about every operational level Pacific War game ever made. You futz around, you try to find each other, and you manage the fighter cap vs attacks. Except, you do all that in about 1/5 the complexity of a standard wargame, and without any counter pushing. Bonus points for a [i]Final Countdown[/i] dream/learning scenario.

The game is a bit longer than I would like, and the playing time advertised is badly underestimated, at least for the Midway scenario. Still, overall a positive experience.

I think that I'm the only person that had a problem with the rules as written; I guess that I'm used to a more structured approach.  I had lots of questions about what meant what in the game but Mr. Cunliffe answered most of those questions in the follow up Training Manual. I feel that the Training Manual would not of been needed had the rules been a bit more tight however.  This is now my game to go to for "tactical" carrier op's in the Pacific, WW2.

I will admit to being a bit disappointed, as I found this game didn't measure up to Hello Stalingrad. It feels more like a collection of mini-games than a duel of carrier fleets. The search and maneuver games are largely vestigial, and while the air combat and ship strike sequences are vivid, I like this system of constant card play and dicing less than the slow build-up to the big break test system that we saw in the previous game of the series. Plus something seems plain wrong in a carrier game where every strike will find its target one way or the other ... even if the system is only modeling the critical strikes that find the enemy fleet, it still feels wrong to me, and in a game like this, feel is everything. Would play again, though, maybe my opinion will improve. Not a bad game but I'd hoped for greatness.

RATING: 7
First game impression. It is very important for the Japanese to gain the edge and strike first, this is a huge advantage and should be pursued by all means. 

In the battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese carriers launched an attack which basically destroyed both the US carriers, sealing the game. 

The game plays smoothly after you've read the rules. It is very easy to teach, and a player can pick it up and play it in a turn or two.

Delightfully creative design, marvelously evocative of carrier warfare. All the tedium of search is avoided by a simple setup phase that can nevertheless feel cat-and-mousey. Then it's all about hammering the enemy flattops while guarding your own, with simple, yet often difficult, decisions along the way. Many subtle features that just fit.

Game play flows smoothly. After reading the rules once the only times I have to reread them are the Repair Points allocations until I detected that these informations are on the back of the Action cards.  I like this game. The counters are top. The cards are on the thin side. The design of the carrier cards and aircraft cards make me somewhat uneasy. A little bit too wild. The Solitaire play is fun. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Replayability/Fun: 3 (1-3); Solitaire: 1 (0-1).

My god this game is bloody.  Ships with 2 or 3 infernos and just as many flood hits!  I have seen the side that lands the first strike go on to not win, but pretty much if you get the drop your opponent spends all his points trying to un-do what you did first.

I think this game captures the rapidly changing and uncertain nature of carrier warfare where a combined air assault could have no effect on a carrier or that single well-placed bomb could sink it.

Fantastic game. I was very skeptical at first--how could a card game simulate carrier battles? But boy am I glad I picked up this game. The rules/mechanics are simple, but the effect achieved is fantastic. It's definitely the best Midway game I've played. It's both fun and a surprisingly good simulation of Carrier battles from 1942 (Midway is only one of several battles included--Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz, and a Campaign are included.

04/07/12 Played a two-player game of the Coral Sea scenario in 88 minutes. 
Overall I liked The Fires of Midway. Positive: adheres to theme well, artwork & iconography good, and relatively short playing time (for a wargame). Negative: a *heck* of a lot of dice rolling, I can't say there's a great deal of strategy - most choices are obvious, and it takes a lot of space. If I'd never played Lightning: Midway, a card game on the same subject, with a lot less rules, no die rolling, and a shorter play time, I would probably rate TFoM a "7". But I feel L:M does everything TFoM does better. So TFoM only gets a "6" from me. Oh, its still quite worth playing, and I look forward to trying it again, but I can't bring myself to rate it higher. It takes three times longer than L:M, costs three times as much, and probably has ten times more rules. Yet its sure not three times more fun. But if you want the nitty gritty; carrier combat at the tactical level instead of the strategic level of L:M, then TFoM may suit you fine.  
05/19/12 Played the Eastern Solomon scenario. 
Probably in order to keep the play time down the game's design seems to be about doing one thing, attack, and hoping you hurt the other guy just a bit more then he hurts you. Therefore, I hate to say it, it all comes down to the roll of the dice. I'd still like to play TFoM some more. I'm merely saying I haven't seen any point in finesse. In other words, if your carrier is damaged, screw it, its probably going to sink anyway. So attack and hope your strike gets though. For there is no way in this game to break contact and make extensive repairs, then reengage.

RATING: 5
 It is pretty much a die fest with very few strategy options.  Not my cup of tea.

RATING: 6
It seems like a pretty good design and has some nice mechanics. I think it does what it sets out to do. However, carrier battles are not really an area of interest for me, so there's probably a limit how engaged I can be by this.

I enjoyed my single play of it as a learning experience. I like trying new games.

It incorporates an element of luck that is very thematic and seems justified based on what we know of historic carrier battles.

It does have a Euroish element when you can choose among various actions rather than just doing them all. For example, you have to choose to fight fires or seal leaks, when obviously you would have crews doing that automatically: It's not really an optional activity. Clearly there could be situations where you would prioritize disaster management, but that would be in extreme circumstances when you didn't have resources to deal with every situation. You should be able to launch a full complement of aircraft and repair a leak or do damage control below decks at the same time. It's gamey, but of course it also seems to work in terms of playability.

Still, an effective design

Clever design that has numerous light (euro-like) layers of complexity, yet it remains a very playable (and replayable) wargame.

Picked up from OfficeGlen in Ottawa.
He's a great source for war games.

I've been slow to understand the rules but after a couple of pre-season efforts I think things are speeding up for me a bit.  

That being said, I am loving everything about this game.  It's an unusual combat system, but I truly like it.  I love the dice/cards combination and this so delivers and in just the right balance for my tastes too.
In addition, its not as much of a table hog as I was led to believe.  For one thing, its really only the initial phase that takes up all the room and then you don't do that part every again.  For another thing, when playing solo I really do not need to speed the cards out into a 6x5 grid.  I can just select from the deck without spreading anything out anywhere.
I really recommend this game based upon what I am seeing so far.

This one has a feel for launching attacks on specific carriers with specific types of aircraft armament and fighter support.  There's a bit of cat and mouse gaming with the fleet location board but it's all about sinking your opponent's carrier fleet.  An excellent follow-on to their last game The Hell of Stalingrad with unique card play mechanisms specific to this game.

Original, fun and fast.
Very luck driven, though, so be warned. All hell may break loose on a single die roll.
But it's one hell of a fun ride.

EDIT: Downgraded to a 7 because it's just too damn unbalanced. A pity, since the system is so much fun.

Good game. A war game in a card game. It can be played in two hours which is good. There are many scenarios and a campaign game. it will not play the same twice so it has legs. It is playable up to four players. It is also a game I can get to the table because it can be appealing to gamers who are not necessarily war gamers...

The rules are clear, reading them and implementing them are two different things though. The game needs a couple of plays to get them right. Getting used to the symbols on the cards and when to use which type of card while moving through each phase requires a few repetitions until you get it right.

The game does mimic the carrier search phase in a interesting way. The collection of player combat cards here is important, but so is the placement of weather tokens. If you are lucky enough, you can also find a Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which allows you to put a CAP mission in the air early in the game. The Search Phase also gives an interesting means of establishing initiative in the form of confident and desperate conditions for each side. This affects your hand size limitation during the Admiral Phase, but also allows the confident player to further extend their initiative by being able to steal an action card (which determines carrier order of play). I found that being 1 and 2 is not always necessarily the best thing

After the Search Phase, the game then moves to a  Strategy Phase where one moves their forces on a battle board. This aspect requires some maneuvering and calculation. Maneuvering forces can be significant, because of fuel requirements and hiding behind weather. I would have liked it if the designer added a little more  to this part of the game. By this point in the game you know where your opponent is. I would have liked to have seen the game going back to more hidden movement and bluffing here. In other words, I think there should have been some type of returning to hidden carrier location after each round if the carriers moved. There should have been some extra means of requiring a strike groups to pinpoint the carriers on the battle board if they moved from one turn to another. (A thought occurred to me while playing the game, the designer should have made a rule that crippled ships cannot move. At least they should have required a crippled ship to make a dice roll to see if it can move - I might house rule this). Anyway, if I had been a play tester I would have suggested to the designer to included something written on the Search and Destroy cards like "PBY maintains contact," "more fuel required," "Flight commander takes a gamble roll 1-4 for contact," or "Submarine contact depth charged roll 1-3 to regain contact,"  (in a addition to the fuel cans drawn during the Sortie Phase), and would have required each player to draw these cards after launching a strike group. In addition to maneuvering into squalls and low clouds this addition might have added that extra uncertainty to your strike groups finding their target while at the same time making sure your carriers are moving more important  

The heart of the game is balancing all that your carrier can do.

Launching strike groups is interesting. Distance is an issue which can affect the efficacy of your strike group. Then you go into dog fights and card play. If you pass that you head into AA and card play. If you pass that then you do your bombing run. The strikes feel just like the movie Midway, where Yamamoto reflects on the U.S. wasting all of its strike groups against his carriers. 

Other actions for the carriers include battle stations which gives the option of launching planes if you carrier is damaged with an inferno and repair your ship. The other action is save the ship where you can build up your hand an do repairs.

On top of the carrier actions there is the Admiral Phase which is quite important. Here you can increase your hand size, put out CAP, or conduct further repairs. Here is a rule tip: please note the Admiral Phase occurs after each carrier takes its turn - not after all carriers take their turn. 

Damage to your carriers is unique. Once a plane does its bombing run, you roll the dice and see where the hits occur after consulting two search and destroy cards. Damages comes in the form of infernos and flooding. Critical hits damage your bulkhead. Here is another rule tip: when you move your damage counter to the third box (or step three), you flip it over to the inferno side in. However, further critical hits do not flip the ship over to its crippled side. The ship may still take flooding and fires, but it is not until the End Phase after all (repeat all) carriers have gone, that your ship is flipped over to crippled if your the bulkhead counter is on step three. As a result, you have time during your Carrier Phase and your Admiral Phase to do repairs on you carrier to prevent it from being crippled.

This is a good game and a keeper. I am sure I will play it many times because it does not take forever to play.  It is easy and once you know how to play it, you will not forget how to play it. It may run a little long for what it trying to achieve and in the process of doing so the actions may become a little repetitive. I can see where people who lay this criticism down are coming from. However, I see a great deal of excitement each time you send out a sortie. The dice are a factor too. People who do not like dice will not like this game. Nevertheless, a great dice roll makes you want to shout out like Bob Dixon: "Scratch One Flat Top." The management of your ships and strike groups make this game interesting enough to get through a scenario even if it may run a little long. After a play put the game away for a little while. When you get the itch for a carrier game, this is a good one to turn towards once again. It will not play the same.

I did read in the forums that someone found a way to beat the system by sending out one torpedo bomber against a carrier with no CAP. I have not tested out this strategy to see how it works.

After having played VG Carrier, this looks pretty intriguing...
And it also appear to have solo rules.
Not sure about the card mechanics, though.

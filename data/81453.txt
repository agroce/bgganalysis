151117 It dropped in the ratings for a while but I want to try it again so its more than a 4, but it needs to do some proving.  I suspect in the end it will be an interesting semi ambitious design that would work great for the right people (maybe mot me).

111116 Tight 2P deck building game...feels almost closer to a more traditional cardgame...well except for the deck building and the non traditional part.  Very good game.

Once the relatively simple, but quirky rule set is understood (it's not really that hard, but to the uninitiated, it could possibly pose a small stumbling block), this is really a nice game. 

It plays quickly, and seems to have different strategies which present themselves, depending on the choices of the other player and the way the board presents itself. I suspect (without proof) that acquiring RED family members is the key to victory, but I cannot be certain of that. Should I do the requisite analysis, I'll post in the forums about it.

This has been seeing a LOT of table time here since Essen, and I believe its quick play will keep it on the table for the quick filler when time permits. The kids like it, thus I do as well.

Famiglia is a climbing game in which, at least in my experience, luck plays a significant role. If you just do not manage to get a pair in one colour, your climb on that coloured ladder is stopped for good. Sure there a ways to avoid the problem by using the special powers cards have to offer, but still it is a question of getting pairs in some colour. At least I did not find myself making any decisions of greater importance. I only did everything I could and that’s it. There were not any other options. In a sense Famiglia creates an illusion of a game while in reality you are just making a series of guesses (sometimes educated) which way to go.

A very odd two player game, seems to work but is on a very fine balance as the game easily breaks if you overuse your powers with some of the cards and seems easy to get in a position of control over the other player due to the luck of the draw.

Mediocre 2-player card game. The artwork is funny I guess, and the rules are simple. The problem is that the game itself is not very exciting. Players have the same starting hand and they slowly 'build' from there. Why wasting time playing this when there are better card games out there?.

Nice card game for 2 players.
has to do with mafia. The players are the godfathers of a Famiglia  and they try to take under them command the best mafia guys.

A non pretentious, fun silly game for 2 with some very interesting choices thrown in. My rating might vary with further plays, but for now it's a lot of fun.

UPDATE: It gets old quickly. There just are too much random factors to be a real challenge, and it almost feels as if once you "get" it, you just play it mechanically. Down to a 5.

UPDATE: I enjoy it a bit more than my previous 5 rating would suggest. Up to a 6.

Slowly build up your deck of cards. It's a somewhat slow process in which you have to use 2 cards of a low value to get a card of higher value. 
But creates the right feel, in which you have to slowly go up the mafia's rank, start on bottom and work your way to the top.
You use, for example, two cards number 1 to get a number 2 card, and so on - to the maximum of number 4. Diferent mechanics.
Maybe it lacks a bit of the fun factor.

Ha már több funkciós kártyák, akkor inkább ez, mint mondjuk az rftg, vagy fairy tale. Főleg ha csak ketten vagyunk. Gyorsan lemegy egy parti, nagyon egyszerűek a szabályok. Egyetlen hibának azt érzem, hogy elég egyértelmű a stratégia, mivel a 4 féle szín nincs rendesen kiegyensúlyozva. A kéket pl. súlytalannak, mi több haszontalannak tartom, néhány kivételes esetet leszámítva.

Nice theme but the game is too simple for me and relies almost solely on memory aspect, there is not much else here. Also, there are some families which I think are important to have in early game, unfortunately at the beginning you can have very little control which ones you will get.

RATING: 6
Famiglia is a card drafting game like no other. It is both extremely simple and quite challenging: players discard one card per turn to draft another, and different suits of cards have different special powers.
There's a definite tension between the need to start slow and "grow" in a curve, and the temptation to use shortcuts to steal higher value cards.
A little abstact game (the cartoony artwork is nice, anyway), deeper than it seems at first sight.

Mmm, do I really need to have another filler of this type? 

I doubt it.

* Update *

After few more plays in yucata, Famiglia clicked on my mind and I'm loving this little game. Very good filler from a very good designer.

* Update *

I have purchased a copy because I love this little game.

* Update *

The more I play it the more I love it, raising and almost reaching a 9.

* Update *

Atfer three games in a row in www.yucata.de on which the other player had me against the wall since turn 1 forcing me to get "0's" pèned my eyes... this game has a broken strategy, if someone wants to play a boring game just try to follow the broken path... I don't understand going through that and kill the fun, but others seem like only enjoy if they win.

I have to downgrade my rating from 9 to 6.

*update*

Playing this game without using the broken mechanic and it's very fun, so upgrade my rating again.

At the time of this comment, I have played 18 games of Famiglia on yuacta, none FtF.

The game is clever, using a minimal number of moving pieces to create a card game that is tense and offers some interesting decisions.  However, the game can be degenerate if the right combination of cards comes out.  During the first phase, if one player manages to consistently recruit good cards and leave the other player with only a single "0" card to recruit, then it is a long slog for the poor sap with a hand full of zeroes.  This has happened to me about 3 times in 18 games, and I've been on the much less frustrating side of it maybe twice as well, which means it happens often enough that I consider it to be a fatal flaw.  Online, where I can play a large number of games simultaneously, it is not so bad.  In that forum, I'd rate Famiglia a 7.  But I am not interested in trying this FtF.

Conseguido en Mathtrade de BSK inverno 2014. Enviado por Julai en Febrero 2014.

Me costó jugarlo. Es un juego de cartas para dos, en el que el objetivo es dar dos vueltas al mazo y ver quien ha sido capaz de conseguir las cartas con mayores puntos de victoria. Para ello, en cada turno uno puede usar sus cartas para jugarlas y permitirle hacer alguna modificación, o recuperar cartas del juego a la mano y coger cartas "de la calle". Hay cuatro familias, y en cada familia hay cartas numeradas del 0 al 4. para coger una carta de nivel n, necesitas mostrar dos de nivel n-1. Salvo el 0, que se puede coger directamente.

Es sencillote, pero da que pensar en cómo usar las cartas. Si gastarlas para hacer algún combo o ver si mejoras el balance de puntos de victoria. 

Lo dicho. Sencillote. No es nada del otro mundo.

Seems really simple, but the mechanism is unique and the gameplay mostly fun. We seemed to get stuck at the end of the game. I had created the ability to take any red card, so I lost my flexibility and had to pass a number of turns. There is quite a bit going on in the game and I enjoyed it quite a bit. My favourite 2-player games are Innovation and RFTG, which are much meatier. My wife wonders why there are no women in the game.

2/21/16 - Very interesting game. There's a bit of a problem every few plays where the cards happen to drop so that one player can lock the other one into taking a 0-value card round after round, while taking better cards for himself. When a game misfires like this, it can be dull and frustrating. But when that doesn't happen, the game shines.

A cool little hand management game where the decisions are actually fairly difficult!  The hand management aspect is actually pretty brutal, as you can completely screw your whole game with a wrong move, particularly late in the first half of the game.

For such a simple concept, the few special abilities in the game add just the right twists to make it a cool game.

Meh. It's a quick and portable game, but the gameplay itself isn't that interesting. As you get better, you understand that you have to discard the cards the opponent needs badly, and this makes the game a little boring as there isn't that much room for strategy. Also, the yellow cards with their special abilities are by far the best cards, though the red are important too due to their extra points. You don't really make any big or important decisions, so it's definitely not even close to be one of my favorite 2 player games.

This card game by FF uses a ladder mechanism as you try to swap cards from your hand to the table in order to get higher-valued cards.  They are in four "suits" which each have a unique ability.

I feel like it's too luck-driven, as the order cards come out can definitely favor one player vs. another based on what cards you were able to acquire previously.  It can be really frustrating to stare at a sea of 2s when all you have are 0s.

It's a game that requires some puzzling out to do well - not terrible, but just not my cup of tea.  I'll pass.

Components: Simple iconography. Fun art; I appreciate the distinct images on each card.

Experience: Simple and fun. Managing a hand of cards is tricky with so many restrictions on how to acquire more cards. With the help of wild greens, I can upgrade quickly, but this also limits the width of a particular color. I like the tension of burning a card my opponent wants, but perhaps revealing even juicier cards now. I like that the best cards will probably resurface toward the end.

Players takes turns recruiting game members from the "Street" into their faction.  Nice, semi-meaty two player card game where players are recruiting game members from four factions.  Each faction has a special power - more points, wild cards, discounts, etc.  Takes a game or two to get your head around it, but there is a very nice game here.  Gives a good sense of tempo and escalation.  You have to be careful you don't get wedged in the end game, unable to play.  Great packaging and art too.

RATING: 3
A little card game involving trading in sets of similar values and colour for higher valued cards of the same colour. The higher values in turn have abilities to assist in this process, enabling quicker, more powerful moves as the game progresses. It is possible to stall out with a bad hand, but I suspect this gets harder to run into with repeated play. The art is very attractive and a bit of humour is thrown in the card names.

Interesting for some time, but ultimately ends up being repetitive.

While it makes sense to progress in each family, players usually end up with a favorite family - and a favorite way to play. This makes the game even more repetitive and luck-based.

A clever two player card game by Friedemann Friese that uses clever hand management and has a deck-building feel.  The mafia theme won't go over well with everyone, which is a shame, the gameplay is terrific!

Very fun and thought out two players game. The theme is well implemented : pyramidal structure of gang/mafia, recruitment in the street...

Quickly opened, quickly explained, quickly played

EDIT : after 14 games, absolutely a must have. The green-haired-man gave us an amazing game for only 60 cards. Very addictive and very good replayability. The key is perhaps to take as much as possible 0 and 1 at the beginning to have a lot of cards in your hand.

My best score : 116

Players take the roles of Mafia kingpins recruiting minions for their gangs. The game is a fairly simple hand management game with rules that are somewhat unintuitive at first. Even though it flows pretty quickly once it has clicked - with occasional bouts of downtime when a player has to think through a particularly involved combo move - it does take a little too long to get going because there inherently is a lot of chaff on the "street" that you have no use for at the beginning of the game.

Weird little game about drafting gangsters using card combos from hand.  The real fun is in using Gangster powers to really steal and recruit better and better Gangsters.

It's only 2 players so that drags it down some (I think it would sing with three with a few tweaks.)  The art is fantastic though and it is a good deal of fun puzzling your way through the best use of your gangsters to recruit the best gang.

Clever 2-player set collection game. Pretty unique as far as I can tell. Each clan's special ability that you must balance between getting new cards ("recruiting gangsters") and getting cards in front of you (your gang members) into your hand (so you can use them) better and faster than your opponent makes for a good filler that's deeper than it seems.

Nice, adorable 30-45 minutes filler. It is hard to manage what to do at first. The way that it plays is very staisfying thought we've found that it is possible (in the 2nd round) to get totally stuck with a bunch of non-fitting cards without anyway getting out.

The rules clraification found in the appropriate thread make the game really shine.

If not the very slow and totally no-emotion beginning of most part of the first half of the game - it would be a solid 8.

I played many games of this on Yucata.  I loved the game at first.  The idea of building up stronger and stronger "connections" is fun.  The different gangs' special abilities are neat.  However, in the end, the game fails.

Far too often one player can get stuck from the beginning.  A player can be forced to take 0 card after 0 card with literally NO CHOICE for multiple turns.  In one game, I had no less than SEVEN such turns before I frustratedly quit.  My opponent agreed that there was nothing I should have done differently.  One or two turns like that are acceptable, but any game where that can happen is simply a bad design.  I an generally a fan of Friese's games, but this one is FULLY FUTILE.  :(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well hmm. It's a game about recruiting gang members, but there isn't much interaction between rival gangs. Your job is to recruit faster and more efficiently than your opponent, but that's it. The artwork is amusing, but it does seem like the green suit is the 'anyone who isn't white' catch-all group, save for maybe one guy.

The game is fine, but it is more about building up your card recruiting engine and it just didn't excite me that much. It's a gang game without any punch.

The first play was actually a lot of fun-- figuring out what the heck was going on (Friese's games are never intuitive to me) was a neat puzzle, and not one I fully solved.

Fun enough, quick enough, and simple enough to warrant multiple plays.  Could've been better if the theme had been pushed a little bit funnier.  There was potential to be more amusing, but instead we have to put up with not really funny pictures which isn't really funny enough.  

Still, the length of time and overall simplicity don't subtract from the intensity of the strategy.  Solid stuff.

I'm surprised that the reviews seem right; that this game is a little polarizing between the lovers and haters.  After 3 games with my SO she has little to no interest in playing another, whereas I could play it 3 more times right now!  It took the 3rd play for me to really dig this design (the first couple plays I thought the game weighed too heavily on the Mercenaries, but I was wrong).  Now I just need to find someone else to enjoy it with!

Very simple, yet very strategic card game for 2 players.  Lots of things going for this small game:  easy to teach, small box, inexpensive, nice artwork - but the game falls a bit flat for me.

Unfortunately, the game just isn't exciting in any way.  You'll often at the start of the game be simply drawing cards from the deck until one of a certain type comes out, then taking that card.  It's difficult to put my finger on what it is that I don't like about the game, maybe it's the lack of real feeling of progression throughout.

It is possible in this game to "play yourself into a corner", whereby you have effectively ruined your hand and prevented yourself form playing any further meaningful turns, leaving you to hope your opponent also has done the same.

Initial Rating: 8.0 ( October 2011)

Famiglia is a good light game, one of the best from Friedemann Friese IMO (I don’t like Power Grid). It’s been almost 2 years since I played the game for the first time and gave it a high rating. Nowadays I’m much al lot harsher with my ratings, almost no game crack a 8.0+ rating. So if I have to be honest, I need to downgrade its rating.

The game is very easy to teach, and it plays very quickly. The theme is fun and the art and components are ok. It has some strategy, but most decisions are kind of obvious, also it has a lot of uncontrollable luck (drawing the cards). It doesn’t  bother me much, because the game is light and quick. What I like about it is the card management necessary, to take cards you need to sacrifice others, it makes for a neat game and prevents a runaway leader.

I heavily dislike the non-standard card size, it makes it very hard to sleeve them and that’s the main reason I sold my copy of the game. Still I enjoy my plays of this and I will probably acquire another copy in the future. I’m worried about the replayability on this one, after all there are only 4 special powers in the game.

Bottom line, Famiglia is a game I still enjoy a lot. Love the theme. I will continue to play it from time to time, but chance are, I will downgrade its rating again sometime in the future.

Another weird game by Friedemann. It's always astonishing what can be done with a deck of cards that hasn't been done before. But different doesn't mean better, just different. In Famiglia you slowly build up your force in one of the four suits. The lowest cards simply can be taken from the display, the higher cards need a pair of cards from the next-lower level. Only the big guys rock but you need the smaller guys of this suit to get them. Three of the suits have special forces that allow for different strategies, the fourth suit just scores more VP's. Famiglia was ok but it didn't grab me. Give me a trick taking card game any time instead.

テーマは面白くオリジナリティを感じる。後から公式にソロゲームが公開されているので、一人のときに取り出してはプレイをしている。ソロゲームとしてはそこそこ面白い程度。二人対戦では、相手の邪魔をしてカスカードしか取らせないようにするのがコツのようで、ぼこぼこにされた。カスカードしか取れない間は、まるで負けが決まったような感じだったので点数は辛目。（カルカソンヌで意地悪されて駒がなくなった時のような敗北感を感じた。）

Surprisingly enjoyable.  I think there is more strategy than there appears.  It is important to time the rise and fall (in terms of hand size) of your family well.  If your hand ends before the game does, or the game ends before your hand does, then you have probably lost.  Now... can the game length be controlled that well?  I'm not sure yet.

A good 2p card game needs to diminish the impact of luck or embrace it to be strategic. A good example of a 2p card game that does this is Lost Cities which allows you to take calculated risks.

I don't think Famiglia manages this very well. It really is a case of capitalising on fortune. Conversely both players learn to play defensively and the game drags

I can definitely see why this game is ranked so low on The Geek: there are several turns where you have literally no choice in what you do. However, I still think this is a pretty good 2 player filler that requires you not only chain your card powers shrewdly, but also know when to discard cards and when to just pick some up, as while discarding can get rid of cards your opponent wants, it can also end the game sooner and/or reveal even better cards, which you might not be able to discard if a 0 comes up as well.

Mechanically, it's more of a hand management or hand/tableau building game than a Dominion-style deck builder.

The theme isn't that strong, but there are tons of references in the artwork and names.

Simply one of the best two players games to come down the pike in a very long time. This game honors the very best that is the heritage established by the Kosmos two player line.

It's really a game of hand/deck/tableau building. If there are no zero value cards on the board you can discard a card from the display. You add back cards from the draw pile equal to the value of the one you discarded. There are 3 factions. One acts as a joker, one as a discount, one can return cards you used to your hand, and the last is just worth more points than any other faction. The game is played by playing a pair of the same faction and value which allows you to pick up a card of a value one higher. The card you gain and one of the cards you used to gain it return to your hand, the remaining card is placed face up in your tableau. The trick to the game is: clever use of jokers and returning them to your hand, using the discounts in concert with this or making the cards zero value (you can pick up zeros for nothing), and timely use of the faction that allows you to return used cards form your tableau. It's actually much more diabolical that it seems, and much more complex than first blush.

Awesome Maura art tied into a wonderful efficiency engine makes for a very wonderful game. There are a ton of tough choices. Often times you have to play a bit of a push your luck game. The first half is totally random, but the second time through the deck, given that you have a decent memory, you can actually have some foresight as to possible draws.

I haven't played anything else quite like it. Plotting and executing the combinations is interesting and fun. It's a good game despite a slow opening.

All draws and plays are open, so there's no harm in playing open-handed -- unless you want to test your memory.

The solitaire variant isn't terrible, but it's not for me.

Minor nits: 1. The Rio Grande box was clearly not designed with the card format in mind. 2. My daughter laments that there are no female gangsters depicted. (I find her objection both funny and virtuous.)

RATING: 7
Pyramid scheming as a card game for two players. Famiglia’s motor is turning two cards of level n into a single card of level n+1, and since this is not something that would make a good game in and by itself, this is a good example of proficient game development. Here, I think the main thing that works very well is putting a lot of pacing decisions into the hands of the players: by scrapping cards available to both players, you can bring new cards onto the table, and the higher the scrapped card was, the more new cards you’ll get. Apart from denying opportunities to your opponent, this can be a valuable tool to fasten up the game, which is over after two deck cycles.

Coupled with nice and interesting asymmetries - there are cards from four suits, each which a special ability - this makes for a nice portable brainburner for two, although I would not expect huge amounts of replayability.

This is a great 2-player deck-builder, and should bring back some of those more recently disappointed by FF.  The rules may read a little 'awkwardly' at first but play-through is fast and fun  - couples friendly too.

I'll need at least one more play to give this a solid rating, but my first play didn't blow my skirt up.

It's easy to get locked into certain colors, and to run out of options, and I can't tell if that's a clever aspect of its design or an annoyance. At the moment, it's kind of annoying -- I don't have a strong desire to play this again.

It doesn't help that the rules are pretty badly organized. Despite not having many rules, their presentation makes it harder to learn than it should be (and colors the first play experience).

After a couple of months, I realized I was never going to give this another shot and sold it.

Good, but tension free two player cardgame. I mean, first time you play, it's pretty obvious what you have to do. Then after a couple of plays later you discover a deeper layer of strategy which you can use to beat your former obvious self, but the new strategy doesn't offer more ways to win, and it's still obvious what to do. Then you discover yet another layer, but still not so much variance. And then you wonder, that after 30 games, why do you come back for more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If I were to ever to do a study or give a lecture on deck building as a mechanic, this game would be the case study.  Stripped down to the bare essentials, Famiglia is just the nuts and bolts of deck building.  Heck, even the win condition is simply the most valuable deck, to prove the point.  So sure, it lacks all the game space of something like Star Realms with all its fancy combo potential, but there is great value in the complete distillation of a mechanic down its most limited offering that is still considered somewhat fun and challenging.  If you want tons of replay this isn’t where to invest, but if you want to explore design, it is a useful and fun diversion.

Interesting drafting / hand-management game where players are recruiting gangsters but then using those gangsters to trade up for more powerful ones.  Two gets you one of the next level.  So two green "0s" gets you one green "1".  Two red "3s" gets you one red "4", etc.  The different gangs (colors) also each have a power when you play them and the higher recruits are, of course, worth more end game victory points.  

It plays quickly and has a surprising amount of versatility for such a small game.  The art is fantastic as always for a 2F production.

RATING: 5
This is a strange game, I'd almost say it was broken. 

Sometimes you get a nice balanced game when both players are able to get their engines started and end up playing a tense close battle with interesting decisions. When this happens the game is great fun, unfortunately in my experience this only happens at most a third of the time.

A more common play pattern is that one player gets an early one or two 1s (particularly if in green) and then has recruiting options. Therefore they can discard most or even all 1s that their opponent could take until a 0 is revealed. The player then takes the card they were able to recruit anyway and force their opponent into stuffing yet another 0 into their hand. It is not guaranteed that the player in the power position can completely prevent their opponent from getting good cards but the odds are massively in their favour. By the end of the first cycle through the deck the player with the early luck has a nice lean powerful recruiting machine in their hand while the other player has a whole bunch of weak 0 cards and not enough time to come close to catching up in the scoring.

Obviously in an unbalanced games it is better to be in the dominant position but is not terribly exciting and unless you really enjoy crushing other players who had little chance, not much fun.

This seemed clever at first, possibly worth several plays. With about a year between our initial plays, it remained intriguing on our second play. But now that we've gotten it to the table a couple more times, I'm not sure there's really all that much to it. Several plays of a heavier game might warrant a 6 from me, but for this 15-minute affair, it hardly seems worth it. I'd much rather play Battle Line for the 86th time.

Lightish set collection, hand management game with some subtle deck building elements. 

Players try to bring new members into their gang from 4 different families. In doing so players not only gain members worth VPs but each family has its own special ability as well. 

To acquire gang members cards need to be played from their hand into their play area, where they cannot be used again unless drawn back to their hand thanks to an Accountant. Brutes use their muscle to reduce the cost of new members on the street and Mercenaries act as wilds making it easier to play a pair of cards to acquire new members.

The game is good but it didn't have enough going on to float my boat. It is certainly much less luck based than true deck builders on the market and that may help it appeal to the more 'euro-centric' gamers out there.

For me it was nice to try but no real need to return to.

Why this is not a 10:

This compact, well designed 2-player game actually feels like a distant relative of Sid Sackson's classic Monad: players have got to recruit baddies of four different kinds (suits, yobs, mobsters and... sort of street peddlers) and then use them to draw stronger people of their own sort for points. It's capital to gather many cards in the beginning so that the player's hand doesn't get exhausted too early, but at the same time the game has got a time limit and all four gangs need to be taken care of if a player wants to score well.

Famiglia demands both offensive and defensive play (i.e. snatching prey away from the opponent), skill at trading and discarding cards off the "street" (where they are drafted from) and good timing. The only caveat might be that the more skilled the players, the more influence luck can have via the cards that appear on the street. All in all, though, it's indeed a game you can't refuse... (by the way, the topic gives Famiglia a funnier presentation but the game actually doesn't need it).

Outstanding climbing-type card game with just enough game space and difficult decisions to explore to retain its appeal and keep you coming back. The theme, art and in-jokes are beyond reproach and simplicity proves once again that it can be a winner over long slogs through rule books and whimsical ideas that 'just occurred' to the designer. A new favourite.

Very complex initially, but I feel it will only take a few gameplays to fully understand how the game works.

I will rate this a 6 for now & hopefully the rating will increase with repeated plays. I do fear that the game has limited replayability once you understand how it works.

RATING: 7
Seems a nice 20 min game of collecting cards across the 4 colours, aiming to meld identical colour/number pairs to earn the next highered number card in that colour from the central draft (when it's available). One of your melded cards stays on the table though, and the only way to get it back up into your hand is to earn and then play a blue card as a special action, which allows you to trade cards in hand for cards you've played previously. Or if you've earned a green card, use it as a lower valued wild for another suit in a meld. Or if you've earned a yellow, play it as a special to allow you to pick up a higher valued card than your melded pair would otherwise earn. So because everything is kind of one-use only, it's a game of gradual build up, focusing on a particular colour and strategy to earn the highest valued cards and earn the most points. It's important to remember what cards your opponent has and it's certainly a tactic to trash cards from the draft that opponents might be able to earn this turn. None-the-less, turns are slick and the game is free-flowing. The different approaches are interesting enough for replay, and it's accessible enough for spouse play. A solid 2 player card game.

RATING: 9
Neat, Fun, Unique, and Challenging 2 player card game. Quirky to learn at first but it is worth it, like with any Friedemann Friese game. It's not quite like a trick-taking game; it's not quite like a deck-building game; it's not quite a set-collection game. The card and box quality is so-so, but the game is inexpensive. Great official solitaire variant !!

I love the 2 stages of going throught the draw deck. I love the choices of how and when to play your cards and choosing what to put on the table. Tactics are good, but strategy with patience for later better tactics is better. Sometimes many options, sometimes only 1 option. Sometimes you can paint yourself into a corner.

My wife kicks my butt at this game.

This is a game that caught me by surprise. At first glance it looked dull and boring. But once I understood it, it turned into a seriously cool game. I like how the possibilities unfold with every new card you hire.

Has cool strategic aspects to it! Very nice.

EDIT (26/09/2011): Copy arrived today! New updates to be expected soon! YAY!

After several more games I think I can say that this game is really very good. At first it seemed that players might be affected by luck and efficient control of the street by one of the players, but this really just happens if the loosing player is inexperienced and does not quite know what he/she is doing. This game requires players to know the mechanic well before they can take full advantage of all aspects of the game. I like it a lot!

A fantastic 2 player game with loads of replay value.

The game starts slowly, but then picks up depending on the combos and families you choose. The game plays out really differently and clever use and timing of combos is essential.

Knowing how well you've done (or doing) is pretty much impossible, which is the only little criticism I have of this game.

Overall, I'm keen to get this to the table as much as possible. A great purchase and not expensive!

This is a preliminary rating and I think it might rise with additional plays. The game has some nice flow in it. I am not sure if the game is stable as the players are able to play some combos that could bring them in a situation where they can't continue to play. Will need to play this more.
Update: I played this game quite a few times on Yucata.de and love it. This is a great 2-player game that needs to be played a few times to apreciate its mechanic. I raised my vote.

enjoyed it alot, although there seems to be a dominating strategy if you go first. Havent tested it enough, but this would really break the game a bit.

update: Lowered the score. Basic strategy is too obvious, anything beyond that is boring.. Almost a game of memory where you have to make possible plays with opponents hand to discard cards that may benefit him/her. To me that would take this game way too far.

Pretty fun, pseudo-deck building game.  It plays quickly and has some interesting mechanics. While strategy plays a role, there is a huge amount of luck related to the order of the cards coming out.

Another Friedemann Friese game that's OK at best. His other game, Power Grid (and it's brother, First Sparks) is great -- but this isn't noteworthy.

I love Friedemann's game designs.  They definitely have an eccentric twist to them (definitely matches the green hair) where sometimes you wonder how on earth the rules came into being.

Fun, nasty little card game where your task is to recruit "gangsters" for points and powers from a common pool while your opponent does the same.

A good 2 player game. I don't find Famiglia as intuitive as Battle Line and it's probably not a great gateway 2 player game, but if your opponent is already familiar with some games and enjoys gaming, this might be a good game.

The theme - of hiring gangsters to build up the more powerful gang - is a bit stretched (after all, in real life gangs, the small timers are hired by the big bosses, not the other way around), but it doesn't matter as far as gameplay goes.

Based on hand management and card collection, this game takes a bit of getting used to. A few games in, I still don't feel completely comfortable with the strategies required to effectively deploy the special powers of the various cards, but that's probably a good thing.

This is a fairly subtle game, where the most critical action is which card (if any) you choose to discard from the 'street'. There is some memory and a bit of opportunity for cunning, but nothing too heavy. The rules in the box are a little unclear, which is a pity for such a simple game. Good fun.

Atenção que esta apreciação baseia-se apenas num único desafio jogado. Não me encantou! Confesso que o design das cartas também não me cativara já antes de o experimentar, mas a jogabilidade confirmou que não é um jogo para todos e, pior do que isso, é um jogo em que os mais experientes vão sempre levar a melhor por um bom número de jogos. Não faz o meu género, contudo, reconheço valor à ideia e aceito facilmente que haja quem o idolatre...

RATING: 8.1
This was a great little filler that packs a really good game in a deck of cards.  The object is to best use the combination of different family character special abilities to acquire better cards with better special abilities. So you are almost creating a ladder in each family and you racing to get to the top character which yield the most points.  Really interesting mechanic of card usage and then trying to recall these same characters back into your hand to use for play again.   Just an interesting and fun game that seems a bit daunting at first as the directions are a little difficult to understand but once you get playing the game play is quite simple.

I really wanted to like this game and to some extent I do. It just happens way too often that 1 person can completely dominate a game, leaving the other player with little to no options, all due to a luck of the draw.
I consider this game broken, which is a pity. With some house rules this could be a nice 2 player game.

28-02-2014. Surprisingly nice game. I wanted to play this since Zee Garcia put it on his stocking stuffer top 10 list. I played it today for the first time and I really like it. It took me some time to get the game, but once it clicked it really clicked. Buying cards.. earning points.. it's like a streamlined, nicer looking version of .. 2p variant for Dominion for me.. or maybe Guildhall ;).

I like this game a lot and will probably buy it. I do wonder a little about the longevity. I fear that it might be a little simplistic on the long run.. but for the price the game is excellent.

Clever little abstract set collecting game that's just different enough to stand out. Worth exploring more. Except for a slow start each turn there's just enough choice to make that it doesn't feel like the card draw is playing you. The artwork is nice, but it also reminds me constantly that it's an abstract mostly numbers game. I like how you have to pace yourself to make your cards last. Go out too hard and aggressively and you'll find yourself in trouble near the end. You're constantly watching what your opponent is doing and trying to block their plans or speed or slow the pace of the game. It's a solid seven as a nifty two player card game.

Bought in like new condition from BGG auction.  Took a minute to clearly understand the rules. Overall a decent game. It does suffer from runaway syndrome. I ended up getting a couple of the best cards early and then you just keep using them to get the rest of the top cards. I do like the strategy involved and the ability to discard a card to prevent your opponent from getting it.  I think this will be a good two player game with two even opponents.

I initially played this twice, found nothing very interesting about it and kept it aside. More than a year later, I decided to give it another shot, but nothing much has changed. 

This seems fine mechanically – the scope of decisions gradually increase as the game progresses and there are some combo-ish plays that can be made. Sure, there's a sizable luck factor in the card draw, but most light card games face the same issue anyway. However, there's a spark missing from this game – it's all so mechanical and I don't feel like I've achieved anything once the game ends. None of my opponents have asked for a rematch either, so off it went into my sale pile.

This is a game that has a lot more going on than first meets the eye. That is a LOT more.

To date I have played Famiglia less than 15 times and I have gone from really liking it to being disappointed that the family was too powerful to realising that this is a piece of genius!

I don't think there is 1 particularly overpowered colour , it is how it is played and who is out on the street looking for work.

[4 plays] I like the level of complexity of the decisions while at the same time having rapid turns and also the need to watch what your opponent is doing. The theme and the artwork are a very nice frosting on this intriguing little game. I can't wait to explore it more.

Update after 2 more plays:  I've got to rate this an 8, since "probably I'll suggest it". I think this is a nifty card game that will continue to reveal some new tricks and strategies for a while. The three action suits all offer an interactive mix of routes to explore.

Most recent plays 1/18/13 with Garrett.

Pörgős kétszemélyes kártyajáték, amiben a játékosok bandafőnököket irányítanak. Céljuk a minél erősebb banda összeszedése.

Nem igazán jelenik meg a konfliktus a játékban a játszók között így pároknak is bátran ajánlható.
Nagyon szépen megalkotottak a kártyák, mindegyik egyedi a pakliban, egymás mellé rakva egy utcaképet adnak ki családonként. Igényes, de sajnos nem a legjobb minőségű.

I love the curve on this.  How you start small, and try to work your way up.  I also love the counterbalance of having to start small again to get the lower cards.

Very different take on a drafting game. It is super simple and it is hard to believe that Knizia didn't make this 10 years ago.  This is all about creating a flexible group of cards that can work together, you don't want to get caught without enough zero cards to build up your hand and sacrifice.  The accountants aren't immediately worthwhile, but you don't want to get to the midgame without having the ability to use them.  The bruisers and the mercenaries are your heavy ammunition to getting consistent worthwhile turns.  Nothing like using your 2 bruiser to get another 2 bruiser to get another 2 bruiser, when your opponent hasn't gotten his bruisers into action yet.

Does this game really work for people? I felt like 90% of the time I didn't have a choice of how to proceed, it was like "Famiglia" was playing me not the other way round. I played 5 games online, out of which I won 3, and I was bored the whole time. I do admit, I have a hunch I am missing something, but if there is something to "get" about this game it will need some very convincing talk to engage me into another game. I usually like card games, hand management and set/ deck-building are things I enjoy, but this game fell very flat for me.

RATING: 6.5
Clever set-collection game where players compete to recruit gang members from "the street". Cards can only be taken if they have a value of 0 or if you have a pair of cards of the same suit of value 1 lower. The trick is that three of the suits have special powers, but using them reduces available cards in hand -- if you play too many you'll be hamstrung in the endgame.

Luck of the draw can be pernicious but there is more to this game than meets the eye. Great hand management. Not picking up enough 0s in the first game was a hard lesson! I like the solo rules, too.

Played once and it felt really boring.  Maybe it's because it was tough to get started, but it wasn't fun.  It felt like way too much luck as well.  I don't know, it just didn't do it for me.  

If someone ever offers to teach, I'd try again.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Standard hand management card game with a gangster theme. The objective is to play two cards of matching values and of the same gang to obtain a gang member of one higher value (up to a value of four). By doing this you can progressively add higher value cards to your hand. There are a few twists as some of the gangs have specific powers and these make the game easier e.g. The Accountants allow you to return a certain number of played cards back into your hand, The Brutes lower the value of the card you are attempting to obtain, and The Mercenaries can be paired with members of other gangs. The highest scoring cards belong to The Famiglia who don't bring any specific powers to your hand and this is where the main strategy enters the game, whereby you strike a balance between cards that give you more flexibility in what you can do and cards that give you more victory points but make it harder to get hold of other gang members. 'Famiglia' is a decent game of hand management but there isn't really anything about it that makes it stand out in any way.

This is a piece of overrated junk.

Reading the rules, I thought this would be quite interesting, slowly but wily building up your gangster mob, smartly using special abilities to quick grab the hotshots while trying to play the metagame of forcing bad choices upon my opponent.

I couldn't be farther from the truth. While the gameplay itself flows smoothly, the strategy completely falls flat as it is so obvious. Grab yellow for discounts, move to green for better steady base, focus on blue as soon as some decent yellows/greens are in front of you and top it off with red. 

If you use yellow to quickly, you burn your engine. If that happens, you will do nothing but poke your nose and grab '0's for the first draw deck (as I did). If you focus on putting out as many dudes as you can, you can end up with just a handful of cards without combinations and even worse, without nothing to do for several turns in the second draw deck. This happened to my buddy, who - clearly in the lead - did not had a single set remaining in his hand, and no special play card either to help him out. He had to sit it out and wait an entire deck for me to surpass him in points. What joy.

Sure, if you know the game both the burn as the overextend won't be happening anymore, but any game that lets you fall into these traps without a means of getting out of them is a badly designed game. 

Could think of some house-rules to fix the identified problems (tossing away three cards to take a card back on hand to prevent quickburn, or cycling cards from your display to keep you at least doing something), but I can also think of a whole slew of other games I'd rather be playing.

RATING: 7.5
Once you figure out that you can be dead in the water by playing certain cards it becomes a much better game.  It moves fast and has great art.  It's a race of efficiency and the powers, though they are few, do give it a lot of flavor.  Thematically it works as you slowly make your way up the gang ladder of power.  Move too fast and you will get outplayed.  Too slow and you miss opportunities.

Interesting little two-player card game that takes a play or two to optimize strategy (cycling the brutes and accountants is pivotal to keeping your engine running). New players and non-gamers may tend to get "stuck" with limited or no options on their turn if they don't quite grok the game, so in addition to teaching rules, I think an intro to strategy is probably necessary with this one when teaching, as well (not something I usually suggest). Clever enough that I'm glad I tried this a few times, but not deep enough that it's going to hold a spot in my collection.

Good quick game, manages to be balanced despite the apparent randomness. The integration of the special abilities of the cards is very clever indeed.  Shame there's no reason to pay attention to the caricatures on the actual cards but that's hardly a gripe.  Main concern is that it's easy to get shut out of useful moves early if you don't get an accountant engine going.

About [thing=81453][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=81453][/thing] is a hand management card game for 2 players, in which players battle to hire the best gangsters on the street to their side.

[thing=81453][/thing] have a interesting set of mechanics with a tight management of cards. The rules on themselves are rather easy, but the game has an unsuspected depth to it, having a proper timming to use cards and in hiring, a good deal of blocking and denying gangsters to your opponent, and the interaction between the powers of the cards also brings thought to the play.

The production valeu is OK - the cards have good art and the graphic design works, but the size of the cards is weird, and the box surely won't hold them if they are sleeved, which is a thing I don't like.

Replay value is anchored in the random order of the draw deck, which makes the play go into different directions, due to the available mobsters on the street. Still, the path of the game will remain the same: going from small fishes to bigger sharks. Therefore, replay value is medium.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player starts with a hand of 4 cards, one in each of the colors (blue, green, yellow and red), and all numbered 0. At the center of the table will be the "streets", from which the players hire the gangster. A player turn is:
- If there isn't a 0 card on the streets, the player can discard a card and reveal a number of cards from the draw deck equal to the number of the discarded card. If a 0 appeared, this phase is done. If not, the player can continue discarding cards, one at a time, revealing cards from the draw deck until a 0 shows up. This is valid until the draw deck runs out for the first time - then the players will be able to do this action only once per turn, even if no 0 card appeared (and the card used to trigger this action isn't discarded now, it goes at the bottom of the deck);
- Use an Accountant;
- Use a Brute;
- Hire from the streets or pass.

When hiring, a 0 card can simply be taken. If taking a card with a higher number, the players must put in the table two cards of the same value and of a value just bellow the one she wants to hire: use two 1 cards to hire a 2 card. The hired card goes to the player's hand, and one of the two cards used to hire (if any), must remain on the table - now this cards is worth the amount of points indicated on it.

The four types of cards are:
- Accountant: allows the player to retreive a card a from her tableau back into her hands, but must put other card from her hand in the table;
- Brute: lowers the hiring value of a card;
- Mercenary: can be used as wilds when hiring mobsters;
- La Familigia: doesn't have ability, just are worth more points.

Play proceeds until both players have passed on the same round, or until the draw decks runs out two times. Regardless of the way the game end, players will have the same amount of turns to play. Then, whoever have the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which card to hire. This is the main decision, and carries both the strategy for later in the game, as well as concerns about what card will stay on the table and the timming of hiring someone;
- Which card to discard in order to draw new cards. This isn't a decision that will happen all the time, since is only done when there isn't a 0 card already on the table. Still, when it does happen, is important, mainly to deny cards to your opponent;
- When use a power of a card. For the Mercenary is easier, as is possible to retrieve it from the table afterwards (as it must be played with a second card), but the Accountants and the Brute must stay, and using both, at key times, can be the difference in winning and losing, as you might not be able to use them again, nor hire more of them to use.

While the amount of different decisions isn't high, nor there are many of them, the game has a good amount of depth in the choices made: they are relevant, since the what one takes is hers for the whole game, and a card not only is worth points, but also is required to hire new ones. For instance, when you have two 1s of the same type, is easy to know you can hire a card 2. But when you do this, you will have a 1 and 2, unable to hire new cards of this type. Therefore, forward planning is very important.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach but with enough depth to remain interesting;
- Quick pacing;
- Short playing time;
- Has interaction, but all is indirect - there is no agression;
- Very portable;
- Decent replay value;
- Language independent.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Only for 2 players;
- Has little theme, and can get procedural;
- A single mistake can put a player in a snowball of problems.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like head-hunting for an organization that doesn't allow for mistakes. Hey, that is pretty thematic!

[thing=81453][/thing] is a clever game, with a tougher management of the hand of cards than I was expecting at first: it seems pretty easy - play two cards, get one from the table, leave one of the played on your tableau. But as the game proceeds, your options get shorter, it is harder to take new mobsters, and a mistake done early on can spiral your play into problems that you will be hard pressed to recover from, if at all.

Overall, [thing=81453][/thing] delivered a good experience in a short playing time, giving options and choices for the players and a reasonable amount of interaction. While I'm not a fan of competitive 2 players games, [thing=81453][/thing] still gets a recommendation.

RATING: 6
Famiglia has nice elegance while having special powers. Which is cool. Interaction is there if you search for it, as the "discard from the street" rule allows for some good blocking if you're paying attention to your opponent. It plays fast and has a natural flow once you're a couple turns in. It's very easy to do yourself in, you've got to stay on your toes and not just go on auto-pilot. My big worry is that Fats Munroe (the 4-strength Mercenary) is too good.

RATING: N/A
Simple card game, where you use pairs of cards in hand to recruit new cards of one level higher off the table. Higher cards are worth more points. Some of the cards have special abilities, allowing you to use wild cards, reclaim previously used cards, etc.

Decent filler, but I really wish they would have used a multi-colour icon for the green cards, which can have variable values. Because they're coloured green like [BGCOLOR=#009900][COLOR=#FFFFFF][0-2][/COLOR][/BGCOLOR], I kept thinking they could only pair with another green, whereas they can actually be used in combination with any colour.

This is a neat little game with a cool way of cycling cards into your hand.  There's a neat balancing mechanism with sacrificing cards to take cards, and the different abilities of the types of cards giving players assorted incentives for taking them.  It's hard to tell if there's one type of card that's preferable to another, but it's interesting enough for me to want to try again, with a different tactic in mind.

“Famiglia” se encuentra ya sin lugar a dudas entre los mejores juegos de cartas para dos jugadores que se han publicado en los últimos años. Si hay que decir alguna virtud rápidamente creo que la más acertada sería su rejugabilidad, es muy difícil que se hagan monótonas las partidas. 

El diseño es muy atractivo, empezando por la caja y terminando por las cartas. Se aprende a jugar enseguida, pero ser un muy buen jugador de “Famiglia” requiere algo más de tiempo. Es por lo tanto sencillo de aprender pero con gran margen de mejora, que es importante. 

El precio es muy económico, y no ocupa apenas espacio, por lo que lo puedes llevar de viaje. “Famiglia” responde a la perfección al dicho de bueno, bonito y barato. 

Lo malo es que parece que no van a ampliar con expansiones, nuevos mazos de cartas o novedades. 

Muy recomendable para parejas.

RATING: 5
This is a quick 2-player deck builder that focuses on set collection. There are only three card effects, each tied and limited to its own suit, meaning card text is unnecessary making it quick to teach and easy to understand.

The game works by having players buy cards out of a market, the cost being to play two cards of a matching suit, both one point lower in value. So playing two 0-cost blue cards, allows you to buy a 1-cost card. A 4-cost card is claimed by discarding two 3-cost cards and so on. Zeroes are free to buy, allowing you to build your initial engine. Played cards go to your tableau, removing them from your hand and play unless you use a card power to pick them back up. It's very simple, but the trick is that using the card abilities (which are very powerful) also require you to play the card you are triggering to your tableau. Using their abilities effectively removes your capability to buy more cards, putting players on a tightrope.

I don't know that there is a ton of replay value once you've explored the strategy around each suit, but getting the timing of when to use actions and when to switch suit focus is challenging enough that it will take a few plays before it starts playing itself. After that, I suspect it will get boring pretty quickly.

I really don't know what to make of this game. I've played it a couple of times with a friend who's also an experienced board and card gamer, and either we both are completely missing the strategy (neither of us did particularly well in either game) or this is one of those games where the illusion of control is much greater than the actual impact decisions make vs. the order the cards come out. It's the first time I've been tempted to read strategy articles (as I like to discover games for myself) just to see what we're missing. I'll probably play this more, and maybe my rating will go up if we're just being dense.

It's got that good Friedemann Friese brain melting quality--like Fresh Fish, but not quite so enigmatic.  It's a card game in which you start with a very limited hand and try to build it up as you play it.  After my first three plays, I think the idea is that you need to build up your hand in the early part of the game and time things so that your hand is running out of steam just as the game ends.  I didn't manage that, and ran out of playable cards early in both games.  Darin whipped me in both games, and I'm looking forward to getting more chances to explore it.

Rummy game that plays like Koi Koi crossed with Bohnanza. Playing well depends a little too much on what other players leave you with. Otherwise, there isn't much player interaction.

Beautiful game and the mechanics actually reinforce the aesthetics! This is a rummy game, where a few twists make the game.

The first is that your hand must stay in order (a la Bohnanza), forcing you to make decisions about the order in which you draft cards.

The second is that your melds are worth more points the longer they are. The problem is, since you have to keep the cards in order, you have to go through some convolutions to continue building a meld in your hand before you lay it down.

The third is that your cards are drafted from face up columns, giving the game a much wider strategic berth than a typical rummy game.

The bow on the package is the way melded cards create an aesthetically pleasing kimono on the table. The scoring structure gently pushes players to create fashionable color and pattern combinations. So gentle that you almost don't notice the underlying brilliance of the overlapping meld possibilities.

Sadly, it's just 3-4 players (a 2-player variant is sorely needed. And the 4-player game is a bit too tactical for the mechanisms to hum properly. I would suggest 3 players only.

Wonderful little card game.  Colorful, with drafting mechanics, that make you think!

RATING: N/A
A clever little card game of making sets before your opponents do. The various kimono design cards establish the possible sets you can make but watch out! As each player scores a set they place their marker on the card for that set and when all the spaces on a card are full you can no longer score sets of that type. This creates the usual tension between waiting to build a higher scoring set (and risk have the card fill before you get there) or score lots of lower scoring sets before they fill up too. The theme of kimonos in the court of the Shogun is mostly inconsequential but it's nicely done and does add a little colour and flavour to the game which I like.

RATING: 6.22
Main Positives: Very beautiful aesthetically. The box is almost like a jewelry box, but the components are just as gorgeous.

Fun Factor: Medium to Low
Complexity: Quite, it's easy to understand the meld but doing it definitely takes a lot of patience.
Replayability: I would play it again

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
The scoring cards seem to be less presentable. Had lots of uninteresting games logged in.

RATING: 7.5
Good, short(ish) drafting game using the nice mechanism of not being able to change the order of cards in your hand.  One person I played with insisted it would be better if you could change the order whenever you wanted, but that would just make the game into a boring set collection game (i.e. he missed the point entirely).  Pleasant, yet satisfying when you play well (and have a bit of luck).  

One of the treats from Spiel 2014.

Charming race to score tricks by taking cards without being able to reorder your cards. The gameplay play is very tactical and you need to have a flexible strategy as cards disappear and players claim various tricks.

The production is attractive with cards representing various patterns and fabrics. The score markers are fabric covered buttons. 

Wonderful new game.

This is a cute game with nice colors.  However, it seems that you'd do best by memorizing what's in each opponent's hand, which is a bit odd for a card game.

Colors of Kasane is a nice minimalist game from Japon Brand.  The game is players collecting and playing a set of cards from a shaqred tableau in a rummy-like fashion, but the game play limits the players to only 12 cards over the course of the game.  Players try to collect melds in hand without reordering cards in hand; once a meld has been laid in most cases  the last card of the previoius meld is available for the next one.  The melds are also common and are defined on a set of cards; once a meld rule has been used it is no longer available for other players.  So players must carefully plan collection and card availability, and attempt to use sets of colors while melding as many cards as possible tactically.  Another thoughful and thematic little game.

Finally played this - and liked it quite a bit. After reading the rules, I was rather uncertain, as it seemed to be messy. But the rules all fall into their place smoothly, and while it isn't hard to learn at all, there is plenty of thinking going on. Unfortunately, it falls into the 3-4 player gap, so I wonder how many plays it will see. Did I mention it looks extremely beautiful?

Calm and unspectacular card game that stands out from the masses of similar light card games with its beautiful Japanese design and theme. For instance, real buttons are used as point markers. Players are vying for the creation of the most colorful kimono.

It combines the card-taking mechanism from Rapa Nui with the hand management from Bohnanza and adds goal cards. Itâ€™s quick playing with only 12 moves per player, packs some punch and has enough originality beyond its inspirations to be a keeper.

Very pretty game, and one of the few Japanese/Korean imports that has caught my fancy.  Some thinking, for sure, and room for clever play and once I can look beyond just my own play, the opportunity to try and interfere with other players.  Nice.

Card game with quirky scoring with buttons! You pick up a card each turn and then see if you can make a particular sequence.

RATING: 6.5
Intelligent and easy-as-pie-to-learn take on rummy. The combinations feel a bit Cribbage-like in their complexity. Best of all is the U-shaped scoring, which rewards you for acquiring either very few different ranks of cards or a lot, and adds tons of depth to the interaction.

Played twice with 4P. Colors of Kasane is a set collection game where cards are drafted into hand, but not allowed to be rearranged. There are various melds that can be scored, but the catch is that players may only score one meld per turn.

I was not too impressed by Colors of Kasane despite my table generally enjoying it. I had a little trouble remembering what cards had been drafted (thus providing some info on which melds opponents are aiming for) and had to constantly check to see the criteria for the melds.

As an aside, the inclusion of buttons as scoring markers is a whimsical touch, but some of the designs are easy to confuse and it is likely that players end up forgetting which marker represents them. The intention is well-meaning, but I think it would have been better if the markers corresponded to the fabric on the player cards.

Interesting quick card game with lovely component (gee how many Japanese games has that exact description?) I like the semi race aspect of trying to score off completing certain meld.. also there is enough tension in wanting to wait around for one more turn to score big but may stuck with dud cards that you cannot possibly score any points with.  I like that you can only play 12 cards and gets bonus points on having lots of colours or very few colours in your meld.

RATING: 7
Clever Rummyhnanza game where players draft cards from a central tableau in order to play assorted melds (straights, sets etc.). Cards in hand cannot be re-ordered, so melds always use the most recently drawn cards.

What wasn't obvious from reading the rules (but should have been) is that players only pick up 12 cards and so are severely restricted in number of melds. Bonus points are scored based on the number of different colours used and for melding all 12 cards, so holding on for higher scoring melds can be very risky.

It all adds up to an enjoyable, engaging filler. The mood feels perfectly suited to 2p play, so it's unfortunate that it supports only 3-4. (Reducing the number of available melds and using a card pyramid a la 7 Wonders: Duel would do it, I think.) 

Lovely components.

Beautiful little game about gathering different kinds of fabrics (cards) and putting them together for beautiful kimonos (combos). Quite puzzly and rather abstract. Like in Bohnanza you cannot change the order of your cards so you have to make the best of your options and there are ways of mitigating it. Comes in a gorgeous handmade box and has has handmade buttons covered in real kimono textiles.

RATING: 7.5
Charming little set collection/hand management game which, to me, feels like a successful cross between Coloretto (the card game) and Bohnanza. Really like the way it looks and its game length/fun ratio. One of the best Japon Brand games to appear at Essen Spiel 2014. Too bad it is only for three of four players. Hope it gets picked up by a western publisher!

Colors of Kasane is a rather straightforward card game that is pleasing and entertaining but does not necessarily stand out in a crowded field of card games. That said, Kasane does have several interesting elements that elevates it from the humdrum of mediocre card games that saturate the market every year. The core mechanic of the game is suit/set collection that leads to a one-off scoring. Thus, if a particular set is scored, it is no longer available for others to score. This creates a small amount of tension during game play as the scoring opportunities do get tougher and only the more complex scoring options are available toward the end. This is in it self is nothing special. For me, there are two unique elements to the game: first, each round every player selects one card from a 4x4 grid. The order of the card selected must remain as the top card in players hands and not randomly placed. If you are thinking Bohnanza, then you are right on the dot. Melding sets must then come from these ordered cards. The second twist comes from card melding that continues from the previous hand. The top card of the previous meld can contribute to the subsequent meld. This means you can potentially take advantage of a previously played meld and plan for setting up the next hand.

Overall, Kasane is an above average card game with several unique elements. I will gladly play this game occasionally but will unlikely rise to become a favorite.

Easy to learn with simple rules but gameplay is sufficient deep and engaging. Player interaction is high. The player cards part of the game components seem out of place and rest of the game components are otherwise average. Theme is really thin in this game though.

This is a great card game that feels like a classical game. It is full of cutthroat moves, and a bit of push your luck. I highly recommend it.

My daughter Sofia and I look forward to playing this with the rest of our family.

RATING: 8
Certainly one of the Avalon Hill Classics and everyone who likes wargames should play this one at least once.  It really gives you a good flavour of combat in the Age of Sail.  True, there are more detailed games out there, but what they gain in depth they more than lose in playability.  If you don't like filling in movement/order sheets then you won't like this - it's a bit like Submarine in that sense, if you know that game but not this.  These sheets aren't too arduous when you know how to use them, and this comes with only a small amount of practise.  In any case, when you're in line formation, it's a good idea just to give orders to the flagship.  The only real difficulty comes with sorting out what happens when ships bump or collide during movement - but that isn't too bad, either.  There are lots of strategic and (especially) tactical decisions to make such as when to sail with the wind and whether to fire at your opponent's rigging or hull.  The advanced game is brilliant, but the basic game will be enough for some.
Great game.  Fire as you bear!

This was on my original Top Five in high school. Love the mechanic of simultaneous orders and seeing what happens. Nothing better than a rake! I showed this to my youngest, who likes Pirates of the Spanish Main, and the little chits scared her off. She doesn't like any game with tiny cardboard counters, apparently.

I played a solo run of Ranger vs. Drake, and that is BARELY scratching the surface.  I do like the game, but I think it shines best in a large group with lots of ships (think: Trafalgar).  You can see the influence it had on [thing=1589][/thing] without the excessive complexity.  The attitude rules are really cool, as are the rules for getting your ships tangled and the boarding parties.  There is a lot of potential in this game.  I just wish I could play it in that setting.

If you have an interest in the Age of Sail, you WILL love this game! Some have lamented about the "bookkeeping" in this game, but I don't think it's that big an issue; it's there, but it's not onerous. There can be slow spots during the game, but it will pick up. Excellent for DYO scenarios.

Plotting movements for Sailing vessels = Plodding movement -- just not as relentlessly boring as in submarine games, if that's a consolation.  There are much better systems to simulate the glorious Age of Sail out there: don't waste your valuable gaming time here.

RATING: 9
So old and still a great game. A true wargame classic. Simultanious movement, different types of ammo. Rich in tactics and scenario possibilities. However the gamesystem needs a facelift and some improvements.

The major disadvantage is that grappling is far to easy. I like naval manoeuvres and long range gunnery duels, but it always ends in a clutter of ships grappling each other. Therefore the gamesystem is more suited for small scale ship actions. In other words the frigate-to-frigate battles in the war of 1812.

Amazing good game.  I probably still hold the record for being knocked out of a tournament fastest (Avalon-Con, Baltimore 1994) Man did I get smoked!!  Two turns.

  One lucky ammo explosion hit on my middle ship of three spread to the other two and followed with two more Ammo Explosion hits on turn two.  The number of critical sixes rolled was mind boggling.  We played a second time and I won, but that was just to fill time.

Game is unpunched and unplayed.  All books, charts, and log pad are pristine and unwrinkled, board is unused, and d6 is original to the game.  The box lid is dished and two split corners and a side tear have been repaired so that lid feels solid and fits perfectly.  Bottom of box shows five places where tape has pulled off top layer of dark blue cardboard, all about 1.5"x1.5".

Great wargame that recreates the era of tall ships - with a touch of 'hollywood' with the ease of boarding parties.  Still fun with pre-plotted movement rules, variable wind strength and direction, ammunition types.  Plenty of decision making fun and strategy for any would be captain or admiral.  A real AH classic that is still fun to play.

I used to love this game.  It's dated now and I would rather play on the computer.  Still, if someone invited me for a game, I wouldn't say no.  Great mechanics, actually feels like an age of sail naval battle.  Good game, but hard to find players for it.  Hence, why I sold mine long ago. Since have reacquired it in trade. Yea!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite an intreaguing game. The rules are not particularly well written, but once you get a grip on them the game plays quite quickly and is quite enjoyable. However the set up can be quite tedious as both players need to transfer the stats of their ships from the rulebook/other source to their ships log. Especially for larger battles, this can take a lot of time.

Jan 2017 - Having finally revisited this classic I am wishing I had played it more!  Just finished a DYO scenario and loved it.  Raising my rating

Several respected wargamers have made the comment below.  Worth considering
(You want to reduce the number of melee rounds per turn from three to one though - that's how it was designed.  The developer for AH changed this to three rounds without telling the designer and the result is that boarding combat is too fast and effective.)

Superb Age of Sail (Napoleonic) wargame! Available scenarios (and their are a many) range from frigate-vs.-frigate duels all the way up to the Battle of Trafalgar. Two levels of details allow players to escalate the fun and record-keeping from the smaller scenarios to the larger ones at their own pace. And the game is realistic enough to keep grognards happy without sacrificing too much playability. It loses one point for it's production which, while uniformly high, is just a little too flat to capture the spectacle of tall-ships in battle.

A classic that is still loads of fun today.  The best part of this system is that it works well for multiple players and can be used for large or small naval battles, though it really shines with smaller engagements.  I like to use it for ship-to-ship duels akin to pirate/privateer actions on the high seas..

One of the best games there is, period.  A big map + big minis + a big group of people + secret orders + some derivative of the rules = a great way to spend an afternoon.  I prefer the basic WS&IM game with some minor corrections over Close Action.  Also spin up the DVD Master and Commander.  Proud to have this in my collection.  Gotta keep a stiff upper lip here.  Bring her into the wind, boys, and fire full broadside!  These days though I would prefer to play the age of sail rules Curtis and I came up with.

It is supposed to be great.  A lot of it is.  But I have one huge complaint.  The guy with the better wind wins.  The other guy is pinned down.   
Two guys in a gun fight.  But one guy is chained to the ground in the middle of a big open area.  I wonder who wins?  THAT's how this game plays.

I had this game as a teenager the 70s, and played it a few times face to face, the rest solitaire. The rules were quite clear to me. It taught me a lot about wooden ship combat, and I see its design influence in more recent games.  When playing fleet against fleet, a better admiral can utterly destroy a lesser. Single ship v. single ship (assuming similar ships) is less likely to show such a difference in captain quality. It's fun to participate as a captain in a large fleet action. Check out "www.youplay.it".

This game is that old?
Breathtaking, wonderful.  Harsh learning curve and some inconsistencies to be sure, but worth paying the entry fee (in both cost and time) to get a 3vs3 game going where every player has between 1-3 ships.  Scales well, if you have many players make sure to ban table talking and use the note passing, as well as a minute timer.

A game that has stood the test of time fairly well, Large engagements look like they would be fun, the small 3-4 ship skrimishes that I have played thus far were only so-so though. A fair amount of chart referencing seems to hide the odds of a hit for me, and playing with so few ships it seems that range is king, which I think would be negated in larger battles. All in all an okay game.

Definitely one of my all time favorites.  Never played it as much as I would have preferred because my main gaming opponent used to get so frustrated whenever he got stern raked that he didn't like play to anymore. Main problem with the game is the substantial difference between French and British crew quality makes it too lopsided in favor of the British. I modify the scenario crew quality so that individual ship crew quality is randomly generated with a slight edge to tbe British instead of every British crew being Crack while every French crew being Average. May not be historically correct, but makes the game more fun and balanced.

A classic game in its day, and I played it several times. Did I have fun? Sure did.

Unfortunately, it hasn't aged very well for a few reasons. First, the scenarios are bad. Second, it's generally only fun to be the British. Third, the game had a nasty tendency to degenerate into a boarding action frenzy. Lastly, the record keeping could become burdensome if more than a few ships were involved on each side.

These days I would always choose [i]Close Action[/i] or [i]Sails of Glory[/i] over this.

We did Pellew's fight against the Cleopatre and it felt like the movies.  If you are a fan of this era at all, you need to play this game.  (And it will be even better with a Chessex mat and Spanish Main ships instead of chits when they come in the mail.)  Update: It did indeed rule like that.  But it will rule even more when I paint the minis from Valiant.

The original AH simulation of Napoleonic naval warfare.  Works best on small fleet actions, but loses flavour on single frigate duels and large fleet engagements.  That said, it does give a good simulation of the problems of sailing when you're dependant on the wind direction for propulsion and gives an enjoyable and absorbing game which 'feels' right.  I think it's been superceded by Close Action, but it will always have a place in my games room.

Making the game a secret-order, simultaneous-action game was sheer genius in creating the tension and battle of wits that characterised age of sail combat.

Ground-breaking game when it first came out which spawned a lot of "follow on" designs in its genre (Yaquinto's IRONCLADS, Avalon Hill's TRIREME) but the state of the art has passed this design by.  GMT's FLYING COLORS and SERPENT OF THE SEAS are far better games.  And for those who want the ultimate of sailing ship combat detail, there's Clash of Arms Games's CLOSE ACTION and its scenario packs, REBEL SEAS and MONSOON SEAS for the ultimate in sailing ship gaming.

Al jugarlo se respiran la polvora y el salitre. Un juego estupendo que despues de decadas sigue siendo un referente entre los wargames navales ambientados en la era de los grandes buques de linea.

El reglamento es sencillo, pero transmite bien las peculiaridades del combate naval en el siglo XVIII.

Lo que menos me convence son las reglas de abordaje, ya que son un tanto irreales y hacen que en ocasiones los jugadores busquen la lucha cuerpo a cuerpo en lugar de las maniobras y el duelo artillero, mas divertido.

Ademas, el sistema no permite llevar con comodidad mas de dos o tres barcos por jugador, lo que impide jugar los escenarios historicos mas grandes, a menos que se reunan una docena de jugadores.

A long time favorite, but it's beginning to show its age. Battles are beginning to look like floating rafts (as others here have mentioned) and some silly situations develop. I confess I and others in my group get confused by the advanced sighting rules, although the movement is fun (and can be funny). There are other games more realistic, but they tend to be a little too involved for my tastes (landlubber).

Wooden Ships is a great game with a lot of imitators, but few that approach its relative simplicity of play and immersion in historical flavor.  My son has enjoyed the game for several years (he is now 13), and we bring it out every once in a while for a good old fashioned sea battle. We also enjoy Man O'War (Games Workshop), but I bought this one in the seventies and it still comes out of the closet regularly.

This is a wargame simulation of the age of sail with a bit more flavor than realism (not always a bad thing).  One of the best game of it's type I have played.  Can be TONS of fun.  Pre-plotted moves are a snap for a wargamer, but meh...as I get older I realize more and more...  I dislike games with plotted moves and have decided they are not really needed at all if the game is designed correctly (down-graded).

This is an excellent wargame.  It has a "captain's orders" sheet that makes the moves a bit like blind bidding.  It simulates navel warefare with many sailing mechanisms and effects.

That being said, it rarely reaches the table.  The game assumes you know sailing theory, it is quite lengthy, has historical ties that you need to understand, and is not well suited for younger players.  

I have implemented some of theses Ideas with the "Pirates of the Carribean" CCG and incorporated wind and other sail effects.  Mostly, I play POC to get my pirate and sailboat fix...

It was highly rated as a war game back then. I remember fierce skirmishes as our ships-of-the-line locked in mortal combat. The game effectively captures the feel of battle during the age of sail. There is just enough detail here to convey that feeling on a ship-to-ship basis. It is also abstracted enough that one could conduct large-scale battles. Sort of like Starfleet Battles, but better in terms of execution.

A game played with written moves, simultaneously revealed.

I've wanted this thing for a very long time and I finally have it in hand. I had played this when I was around 11 and have had a soft spot ever since. My buddy--I think Radja Loshe-- taught it to me and I think I taught him Squad Leader...a great way to start out in a wargame hobby of youth. Very excited to see it played today.

In skimming the rules since I've picked it up, I think this thing will hold up to my memory. A very cool system that maintains playability and some nice 'advanced' and optional rules to flesh out the basic learning rules.

Very cool and right up my alley.

RATING: 7
Two plays only

Tense cat-and-mouse wargame with opposing ships manoeuvring to get the advantage of a killer broadside on each other. The age of the game shows in the rules and graphics, but the gameplay is still remarkably good.

Simultaneously plotted then simultaneously executed moves mean you can rarely be sure whether a move will come off or not until both players' moves unfold - and every now and then you plot something wrong and crash into your own ship!

The boarding and melee rules seem like a cop-out crapshoot after the delicate manoeuvrings, and heavily favour the better quality crews. If you have the better crew and the other player is outshooting you, just play dodgem cars, ram him and board.

Not sure I'd want to play with more than 4 or 5 ships per side without teams of players - the plotting overhead would be horrendous.

I've always liked this game even as new games of the period came out. The secret notations of your moves makes the game a lot of fun, and basic rules are very simple. so it can appeal to non-wargamers easy enough. There are various advanced and optional rules that you can cherrypick to add a little more complexity or intrigue depending on your taste. I would suggest using basic rules and adding in the stricter rake rules, variable wind changes, and different types of ammo.

This was one of the first games I bought, along with Squad Leader, Ambush! and Up Front. And it remains one of the finest. The simple rules manage to capture so much of the essence of Napoleonic war at sea, and teach you first-hand the importance of ship position and heading relative to wind direction, the dangers of a lee shore, the importance of manoeuvre, broadside and raking, and so much more. A brilliant game, marred slightly by the heavy dependence on tables and logs, but probably still my favourite game of all.

Interesting game covering late 18th and early 19th Century naval warfare, a topic about which I know very little.  I've only played the basic rules in a scenario with one ship on each side.  I can see how the programmed movement system works for this type of combat.  Like many games of its age, it is a little clunky now but still rewarding.  My rating may well improve with exposure to the advanced rules and more complex scenarios.

RATING: 6
One of the classical game that breaks everyone's mind about games.  Authentic, playable, individualistic ...heck, what else do you want from a naval combat simulation? It gets a mere 6 from me because I am not a naval buff, not because of the game.  The game itself is top notch and recommended unreserved for anyone interested in naval warfare.  Check out the late movie "Master and Commander" as well.

RATING: 7
A true classic.  Close Action is far more historical but this one basically popularised the genre (unless one wants to go back to Cormier's Trafalgar) and is still far more playable.

[b]Important:[/b] Note that the three rounds of boarding per turn in the Avalon Hill edition were not the designer's idea, they were added by the developer without checking with the designer.  They lead to the game's main weakness, a tendency to go for huge multi-ship melees since boarding combat proceeds at triple realtime speed.  Go back to one round of boarding combat per turn as in [b]Ship of the Line[/b], the predecessor rules to this game, and historicity improves immeasurably.

Have spent many an enjoyable hour on this one.  The guy with the wind has a huge advantage, but that is how it works in sailing.  Using the advanced and optional rules really spices this one.

Classic AH wargame with mechanics that can be easily played with miniatures.  The movement system is realistic, requiring players to build their strategy around wind attitude.  The scenario we played was pretty balanced, historically accurate, and keep one on their toes.  Between the roundshot being fired from all sides, tacking into the wind, negotiating around drifting, immobilized wrecks and your oppponents ships just waiting to grapple and foul the rigging of your ships to swarm your decks with boarding parties, you've got a lot to think about it with a caparatively simple ruleset.  (An atypical AH combination.)  Solid game for what it is.

One of the most well-known Age of Sail wargame of all times, and a AH huge hit; it has a nice thematic blue-and-white rulebook that's as easy as the other editions, and still the grappling is done the wrong way.

You can play with a few ships to  an entire naval battle. Recommended.

How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways!  To my mind, a perfect wargame for its excellent mixture of historical flavor and abstraction, and VERY scaleable, from a basic-rules single-ship action to a full-scale advanced-rules titan-fest with dozens of ships per side.  Loses half-a-point for the semi-steep learning curve, but otherwise excellent.

It finally came!  I've read through the rules, and while the "basic" rules seem easy enough, it'll take some serious digestion to wrap my head around the advanced rules.

If this game doesn't quicken your pulse then the blood of a wargamer is not within you. No other game of this era (and   or - a few years too) does it anywhere as well.  Many (mostly SPI) are just plain turgid.  This game has variety, action, tactics, heartbreak, and glory (although to some degree it can start to feel a bit repetitious, scenario to scenario).  The components are very nicely done as well.

There is no talking between allies.  All orders and communication have to be written in advance.  We played a four player game with each person controlling two ships.  My fellow team "Captain" and I came head on at the enemy. After our first pass we turned in unison toward the closest enemy ships.  The enemy had divided after the first pass.  We without communication circled back in a precise line, one after the other and raked two of the enemy ships.  We left one ship a burning hulk and the other with damage.  The opposing players couldn't believe we did a perfect naval maneuver, firing and inflicting heavy damage.  Our opponents in the heat of an emotional outburst immediately asked to see our logs.  We denied their request for parley until after the game was over.  This story became an infamous joke within our gaming group.  "Let me see your logs!"

RATING: 9.2
I played this game over and over when I was a kid, from encounters between two frigates to Trafalgar. The core rules are simple and clean, while the "advanced/chrome" rules can be easily memorized. The game is based on simultaneous movement, and while it can be played solitaire the player will miss some of the most subtle surprises a smart commander in an agile ship can pull on an overconfident opponent. We were so committed to WS&IM that we even created the rules to mix it up with... Richthofen's War! The result was a steapunkish game where planes were able to take off from big ships, engage in duels and attack enemy vessels. We were crazy, but I do miss those days.

RATING: 8
Very solid game that captures the Age of Sail feel without much complexity. I'm a fan of plotted, hex-based movement. Out of the box, the game can drag a little, and I've never attempted any of the giant scenarios. The tournament rules on BGG beef up firepower a lot and speed the game.

Components (especially the counters) were never very good, and they are especially dated compared with modern designs like Flying Colors. That said, WSIM converts to miniatures easily, and it's a great platform for my Sails of Glory miniatures.

RATING: 8
Love this game.  The only thing better was the computer version which I had for my old x386 PC.  Hexagonal movement and game scale don't allow for the subtlety of movement one might like when imagining, say, the battle between the USS Constitution and HMS Java, or the devious tactics employed by real or fictional naval heroes of the era, but it still conveys the flavor of those battles.

Ahhhh, WS&IM.  This was the first wargame I ever purchased.  I was big into Napoleonic naval stuff at that point in my life and this was the game for me.  have not played in a long time but based on what I am reading it has stood the test of time better than any other (except possibly russian campaign)

RATING: 7
Very good try about sail wargaming. Movement and combat based on pre-recorded (secretely) actions. It is mandatory to record actions for every ship in the scenario so it becomes a nightmare for large scenarios such as Trafalgar. Not a wargame for today standards but still in good playable shape. A must have in any collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Does a wonderful job of capturing the tactics of the age of sail in a set of (fairly) simple rules.  If you know how sea battles were fought in those days most of the rules are intuitive. Probably not for the German Boardgame crowd but a classic hex and counter game.
Played again recently, still fun.  A classic. 

EDIT: The rules are too generous about boarding actions compared to history (where they were quite rare and often failed).  We now play that the defending ships gain an advantage (+1 modifier to boarding rolls which makes the game a bit more realistic.

Nearly all scenarios break down into two parts. The first part is plotting and maneuvering. I really enjoy this part of the game even though many opponents criticized it as being too long. The second part is grappling once the ship close followed by a war of attrition melee which is ahistorical and a bit dull. Still this is one of my classic favorites even though I nearly never play it anymore.

My first Age of Fighting Sail game.  One of my first wargames and as a result is near and dear to my heart.  Rules are not so complex that youngsters cannot learn.  Standard Avalon Hill fare - geomorphic map that can be used for deep oceans or shorelines, colorful counters, straight-forward game aids, and few scenarios.  Has been surpassed by other, later games but still is one of the best AH ever published.

Love the feel of this game and how it really simulates the age of sail in a very user friendly way. The simultaneous orders are perfect and the tension that builds is one of the gifts this game just keeps giving. The melee is a little abstract, but necessary to keep the game moving. Plays multi-players easily. Still one of my favorite games that will get pulled out and played now and in the future for years to come.

Played the hell out of it. Favorite two battles ever were multi-player games. Two strangers  at a college club asked my friend and I to play. We agreed and the guys pull out a half a dozen beautiful hand painted miniatures....for their side. Kind of the gaming equivalent of the custom made two piece pool cue. We smoked 'em two games straight and with flat card board counters. In the second game my friends ship was grappled and both were drifting toward land. Just before disaster, he captured the enemy, ungrappled and sailed off in his hand painted miniature prize while his own mastless flagship hit the rocks. In the other, he and I split up and commanded opposing sides with a couple newbys as subordinates. What are the odds of getting 4 people can't tell left from right under pressure in the same game at the same time. One of the few games I didn't dump on ebay last month.

My first ever board wargame.  Now on my 2nd copy after playing the first to the point of being illegible.
I give it a 10 because I have always enjoyed playing this game, but that rating is based on a slightly modified advanced game; whereas the regular advanced game I'd give an 8, and the basic game a 2 (I don't think the basic game is worth bothering with at all).  If you understand the function and operation of a pencil, you can play the advanced game in a few minutes.

IMHO one of the first really decent games depicting ship to ship fighting in the age of sail.

Have played this game a lot, with my dad as opponent. Since he is/was a local chess champion, he is better at anticipating moves than I am, and I win only on out of three or four. 

The ship-to-ship combat feels right, also after we tinkered with the CRT and the Critical table, to avoid the change of catastrophic explosions. Games are much bloodier than historicall - we usually play until one side has no more ships. We are both impressed wth the way the "double-blind" movement system does not slow down game, rather, it intensifies the gaming experience. But it does not work well solitaire...

The historical scenarios are not that well balanced - both he and I are naval history buffs and can discuss battle scenarois for hours, but we keep coming back to the point-based do it yourselfrules, and the last many games we played with mirroring fleets. Also, the counters do look a bit dull, nowadays.

... and on the eighth day S. Craig Taylor created WS&IM.  I once went so far as trying to obtain the rights to this gem (still have the nice letter I recieved from Mr. Taylor as I sought the the location of the Grail) to keep it alive.  I've played it with the counters, with miniatures, and using the original Ship O'the Line rules ... bliss.  The pacing of a si-move wargame might have been (shoot--probably WAS) created just to showcase the near-perfect flow of a hard-fought WS&IM engagement.

Best "Age of Sail" wargame/naval combat game out there.  Some people complain that their isn't much to look at but I love its simplistic form.  Simultaneous action leads to very little downtime and fast action.  Even a moderately sized combat scenario can be played in about two hours.

I have played this game regularly since it first came out, and also bought and painted miniatures to keep the interest going.  The hex rules yield a too-liberal definition of a rake, but otherwise very good.  It teaches the relative benefits of the "weather gauge" and "lee gauge" with little pain to the players.  An excellent tool for understanding why Age of Sail battles were fought the way they were.

This game is a classic. It was accessible, reasonably accurate, instructive regarding the problems that faced naval commanders of the age - and it managed to be DAMNED FUN too. 

Talk about breakthrough mechanics - the entire concept of the ship displays and plotted movement in this game were utterly brilliant. Play this game now with miniatures (PotSM works great) and a smile will light upon your face. 

Yes, you can go too far with the concepts introduced in this game. The concepts introduced in WSIM were essentially hijacked and were responsible for Star Fleet Battles - the only game to give Advanced Squad Leader a real run for its money in complexity. 

But it all starts here. If you love naval history - you simply *must* play this game.

My rating doesn't take into account my nostalgic love of this game.  I'd rate this a 7 or even an 8, but the game at face value has some serious issues.

Part of the issues might have to do with the hex based map.  To really simulate wind powered ships wind needs to be able to come from more than 6 directions.  

Ranged combat is good, but the game's ahistorical tendancy to end up in a lump of melee in the middle of the board should not happen in a historical simulation of this period.

This seemed to be a great concept somehow gone wrong.  The idea of simultaneous logging and movement was apealing, but in practice I found it tedious and annoying.  This is probably historical, but the side without wind advantage often seemed to find it advisable to avoid battle rather than engage.  Part of it was probably my relative inexperience re: the period, but after a half dozen or so playings, including one within the last year, I could never warm up to this one.

I'm really fond of this game. It's a personal prefference. I read on naval history and I try to buy any game which deals in naval battles. So naturally this couldn't have eluded me. Now in Greece we rarely get the full list that people can find in the US so when this single copy showed up I snatched it immediately. I really like this game but again I'm having trouble finding players due to the complexity of the rules. I've tried making a variant with simpler rules and even created an RPG variant where each character controls his own ship. I give it only a 5 because of low re-playability (haven't played it alot that is).

Played this to death as a teenager, but have yet to put it out on the adult gametable.

Still would like to throw on the Master & Commander soundtrack and sail the oceans again, though...

While crude looking, clunky, and somewhat bland, this was a fantastic multi-player game in its day. Would never play it again, but still remember great games from 30 years ago. Not many games produce such memories.

Tactical ship to ship warfare in the age of sail. Includes wind effects, all the fun bits of doing boarding actions, and so on. A very good representation, and permits large battles with individual ships each controlled by a different person (which can be a huge blast).

We came to this a bit late, and found it a bit dry (especially after playing Attack Sub).

I love this game. Tall ships are cool, and Captain Sir Edward Pellew rocks the house!

This takes me back. Great traditional-style wargame. A few sketchy rules, but we used to play this all the time. Trafalgar was insane. I always liked the fireboats myself. Just got off eBay! Looking forward to playing it again.

Only took a couple of years since this was posted to play it with my son. Ran the first two small scenarios. First was lame, second was better. Looking for another good one to play, and to move to the advanced rules. I lost both games :(

One of the best games that I own that I don't get to play because can't find opponents.

Only played once. The sailing I understood very quickly. However I could not hit anything with my cannons. If you want to understand sailing, this is a good game.

As a game, this is my least favorite Naval Age (Ancients and ACW are more exciting with ramming).  But as miniatures based playable eye-candy (see http://www.rodlangton.com/napoleonic/junopics.htm ) hands down THE best category out there.

Played this a bit back when it was new, but too much bookkeeping, and play too slow for me.

This game is a lot of fun.  Not much to say about it - it's an Age of Sail combat game.  The ships have pretty basic weapons, but, then, it's age of sail.  They fire cannons.  That's it.  Damage is recorded with tracks for hull and sails - more of each for bigger ships.  It's an easy to play game and record keeping is not terribly rough with it, allowing fairly large numbers of ships to be involved in the actions in a simple 2-player game during an evening.

I have owned and played many "Age of Sail" games since 1974. The original "Wooden Ships and Iron Men" from Battleline, the Avalon Hill version of this classic game and even the "Ship of the Line" rules from which this game derives.

I have also played "Close Action", "Fighting Sail", "Frigate" "Beat to Quarters", "Flying Colors" and others. But, for some reason, I keep coming back to "Wooden Ships and Iron Men". It just seems to strike the balance between 'realism' and 'history'. All of the games mentioned have their pluses and minuses, but for me, this is still the best one.

The log sheets take a bit of work to fill out if you are doing a large battle but overall its just a better simulation. I couldn't really 'get into' the movement system of "Flying Colors" nor the way combat worked. For many, this is still their favourite Age of Sail game.

A real change of pace style of wargame. Sailing ships at sea. 
The game system is real simple once learned. Scenarios aplenty. From all different periods of history. 
The trick is to learn how to use the wind. And how to use your crews to their best advantage.
Played this game a lot over the years. Easy to learn and some scenarios are real quick to play. I've taught many a young teen to play. And since they have a decent chance to win they always came back for more.
I've seen this played with minatures and it makes it an even more visually attractive game.
Who wouldn't want to be John Paul Jones, or Lord Nelson. Everyone needs to command the USS Constitution at least once in their life. Highly recommended.

got this as part of a box full of old games from a persons's attic...I understood it's place in boardgame history, but I'm not interested in old chit wargames, traded away...

Loved this kind of game. OUT it was Starfleet Battles. Sadly couldn't drum up enough interest for big games.

Good game.  Somewhat complex, so created a home-set of 'light' rules.  Well done nonetheless.

Another one of those Grail Games. I only have a few but I always wanted a copy of this. Remember eyeing it in my youth and not being able to afford it. Now I have a copy that is in excellent condition for its age. Supremely happy.

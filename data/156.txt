Much more than just a kids game - some important opportunities or decision making and even being a bit nasty if you think you've worked out what someone else may be trying to get (or dealing out that extra card just when they think they're about to win). Best played with 3-4 people, more than that is a bit too random.

Nice path construction game and a great family game. Works well with nongamers as well as gamers since it can be played rather lighthearted or more cutthroat with more seasoned opponents. I prefer this one to it's sister game Expedition (mostly for the English cards) but the rules in Expedition are better. In particular, the rule that does not allow branching off from a loop takes some of the tricky plays off your plate. But at the same time it makes the game a little more accessible to younger players.

I really like this game, and I love the theme---better than the Expedition/National Geographic Expedition theme, although their information cards would be more up to date.  A great light game with blocking elements (actually, it reminds me a little bit of Ticket to Ride---but the two games are very different.  About the only thing that's really the same is the path blocking and little plastic things you put on the board.  But the feeling of it being a light fun game is there).

My wife and I played this a couple times and really for the most part had fun with it.  She beat me.  I feel like it does suffer a bit from what I am now going to call ravensburger syndrome which plagues games with long playing time and repetitive movement but no where near as bad as Master Labyrinth.  I will definitely play this one again.

Amusing enough kids game, with a nice endangered animal collecting theme on top. Move around a board using pointers to track progress and pick up animals that match those in your hand. There's a couple of additional factors for a bit of variety but the game is simple enough and would definitely be one that children would love. Probably too light for me, Elfenroads is a better "place stuff and move" game.

This game looks like it is intended for people who try to force overly educational toys on their kids, but it is actually a very fun game.  There is alot of planning involved for a family game.  You always want to do more on your turn than you can.  The board is very attractive, except for the big icky snake in South America.

This is a pretty simple game about 3 neutral routes which get expanded by committee, and you try to reach all your animals. There is a pretty wide range is usefulness of the chance cards. There’s not too much control, but given the flow of the expeditions, you can kind of predict where they might go. But as I learned, you also might not. Travel vouchers are key to the game, and I think doing well means learning to spend them effectively.

Wife didn't like this game too much.  However, I enjoyed it with my kids.  There is a mean streak in it along with quite a bit of luck.  However, it is a neat concept that I'd like to compare to the game Expedition at some point.

RATING: 8
Unlike some people, I prefer this game over its successor, Expedition.  First of all, the production and theme are much better, in my opinion.  Second, the rules to Expedition, especially the loop rule, seem to add unncessarily elements.  And I like some of the things that were removed in the transition from Wildlife Adventure to Expedition--the chance cards, especially.  Now (as I write this in 12/05) is a great time to pick up a copy of this game, as well--copies have been going for very reasonable prices on eBay.

Kind of like a scavenger hunt for animals.  You have a stack of animals in your hand that you're trying to get to, as does everyone else.  You only can score those animals in the turn the pointer is placed.  Each player may trigger someone else's animal, as the three different colored paths are open for every player's use.

Production: Fairly functional board depicting images of the various animals to be spotted.  Play: Straight-forward for the first part of the game as players are able to race around, easily sighting many of their animals.  Then things get a bit trickier, as all the easy finds are gone, and one must carefully maneuver expeditions toward target animals, trying one’s best to hit spaces with free vouchers and extra turns.  Still, not many interesting decisions to be made, and I found myself hoping it would come to a swift conclusion, regardless of my standing at the end.  (1+0+1) (1 play)

This is a great game for learning about different animal species, and a game I would look forward to introducing to my kids if I have some one day.  It also scaled down to 2 players much better than I expected.  Some luck is involved in winning, and I'm not crazy about the Chance cards, but overall I was pleased with this game.  I am curious about the Expedition version though.

RATING: 7
[Kramer] A tense, tight game of manipulating three routes to the destinations you seek. The pain in the game is the travel vouchers; replacing after your original 10 are gone is unlikely, and you so badly need them when you need them! A simple and psychological game that is underrated by many; plays as well as a serious strategy game as it does friendly gateway game. Classic Kramer. Tragically under-recognized, under-appreciated, and under-rated. This game inspired countless others, and is better than most of its kin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Way ahead of its time, and still has some dated elements (like the "go again" spaces and the Chance cards), but also some good route development mechanisms that seem to foreshadow TransAmerica.   There is some tug-of-war with the different routes that makes the game frustrating (in a fun way).   There is a metric TON of luck, so that can also be frustrating for people who love to plan.  Learning about the animals is an added (and often hilarious) bonus.

Kramer and Mrs. Kramer's game of worldwide safari is a fun game for adults. Just by reading the rules, you make think that there is not much there, but within the game you'll find interesting decisions, resource management, and GREAT components. Another old, but not dated, hit from Ravensburger.

Excellent path making game, but this original edition has some old-game features, such as the Chance cards. You don't have loops, you have 10 travel vouchers which you spend in different ways, there are obstacles to block paths and the routes are a bit trickier. Although a good game, we found it ground to a halt too easily and we missed the loops you get in the later version Expedition. This version is not as fluid or challenging as the re-issue, but it's interesting to see how this game has been modified.

Played 10+ times with 2-6 players. A mediumweight boardgame that has a very simple mechanics. This game is old, and feels a little old, but that doesn't mean it is not a pleasant gaming experience.

A great family game with an enjoyable educational value. Players travel the globe in search of endangered animals that they have cards for. The difficulty lies in the fact that there are only 3 traveling expeditions moving around and all players can affect all expeditions. When one lands on an animal that you have a card for, reveal it and read the educational bio for the animal. First to gather all their animals wins.

This one is a hit with the family and I would love to see a reprint someday. I am not a fan of the liberal bias on endangered animals "The greatest danger is man" blah blah blah but the mechanics are fun.

Update (4/7/16):
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
Many, many years later, I was finally able to give this one another shot. I liked it, but we played with six players, which I fear may reduce the strategy a bit. Once again, I find myself needing to play it again for a better evaluation! However, it would definitely be a great game to play with kids.

Original comment: I lucked into this one for $3 at a local shop. I like it, but want to play it again for a better analysis. It seems there isn't enough player interaction, and it's hard to influence other people's play.

Wildlife Adventure is a Kramer family game about visiting endangered animals worldwide, which includes educational materials on the animals pictured, some basic population information and threats to their survival.
The game itself is about visiting all the animals you have in your hand most efficiently, using three shared expeditions. These expeditions tend to get rerouted frequently, so having flexible plans, or placing barriers to movement are also possible in a limited way.
Unfulfilled mission cards count against one's score, so players may need to exchange some cards. Players have a limited stock of vouchers which allow them to take extra actions, place or move barriers, or make some special expedition plays, such as picking up the active arrow, or playing an arrow on an already used path.
It can become fairly interactive, or stay largely non interactive based on cards in play, number of players, etc.
I thought it was definitely a step up from a bottom level kids game, but not a huge step up.
Ravensburger materials are sound as usual, but the box seems very generous for the actual content, as it comes in standard long-box board game size.
The game itself is alright but not fantastic for adults, it was later reworked with Queen as Expedition, and in 2013 as Expedition: Famous Adventurers.
As it is, this is a mid-6 game for me, and probably won't be a keeper once I find a good trade, or a worthy young recipient for it.

I like this game and can recommend it to gamers enjoying Transamerica or Ticket to Ride. But it got mixed reactions even with casual gamers. They felt that it comes down to luck of drawing the right animals to explore on the expeditions. A further element of luck is added by chance cards which differ in their strength. The main element of influence is in using the travel vouchers at the right time to change the expedition routes or explore two places in a turn. I think there is more to this game than plain luck. I have to try out its successor Expedition.

A pretty well constructed game that holds up remarkably well for being over 20 years old now.  You really have to pay attention to make sure that you reveal your card when an expedition reaches that point - it's surprisingly easy to miss.  There is a nice breadth of choices to make, though I suspect that this is best played with fewer players, as the chaos level is lessened.  I think that this would be a good game for children, offering a non-overwhelming number of options, but still providing room for clever play and even a little take that.

Very similar to Expedition, this endangered animal themed game has several notable differences (everyone starts with 10 travel tickets instead of 3, blue spots grant 3 extra tickets, no loop advantages, are able to parallel same or other expeditions on same arrow, has obstacles, and can trade a travel ticket to dump a card and draw a random card and lastly, chance cards for landing on red spots).  Seek to move expeditions to see all the endangered animals as possible - game ends when someone plays out their hand or no one can place another expedition arrow.  Great game for 2-3 but starts getting quite chaotic and difficult to plan ahead with 4-6.  Very family friendly if you can find a copy of this game as its OOP.

A great family game.  I like how the 3 different expeditions work and the tactics of trying to move them towards your "secret" destinations.  There's some luck in the card draws but once again the player who manages the expeditions the best and utilizes some of the defensive tactics well should win.  The booklet that describes each animal in detail is fantastic but it's a bit sad that so many wonderful species are disappearing from the earth each day.  I wouldn't mind playing an Audubon themed version.

You add an arrow to one of 4 expeditions. You have 4 cards that you need to have explored to finish the game. The game ends when the arrows are used up or when someone gets all 4 of their destinations. There are some rules to spice it up, but that's the basic idea.

Much easier to play than Expedition, as the animals are easier to spot and are more distinct than the buildings in Expedition. I don't think this is a bad game, but I don't see why some people rave about it. It was a pleasnat enough way to spend an hour, but the decisions weren't very tough or very compelling.

game with a great learning factor (learning about the worlds geography/continents and learning about endangered animals) but also having a tactical aspect with route planning. Great family game.

Another very difficult to find game! I have been searching for this one for a couple of years. I finally found a used copy and really enjoy playing it. The mechanics remind me a bit of TransAmerica and Let's Jet combined...but still it plays in a very unique way. 

You begin with a hand of animals and you must go around the globe trying to save these endangered species. There are 3 possible routes that can be created with either red, blue, or yellow plastic arrows you place on the board. The first player to finish his/her hand of cards ends the game. Then everyone counts their completed animals and any remaining in hand are subtracted from the total.

Pretty fun.  Not sure that the obstacles are of much use, except perhaps in the endgame.  Traded.

RATING: 7
The animal cards have interesting facts about the pictured animals.  Unfortunately, all of the animals are threatened or endangered so it gets a little depressing to read them.  The rules are pretty simple; the most complicated part is remembering what you can do with your Travel Vouchers (a player aid would help).

In this animal-themed route-building game, players have communal control over three expeditions, whose aim is to visit all of the animal species identified by their cards.  There tends to be a lot of multiplayer chaos in this game, as players try to control the direction the various expeditions are heading.  Still, it's good fun if you don't take it too seriously.

Virtually no strategy.  Just go where you can nab an animal.  No conflict between players at all.  Boring.  Revised rating from 1 to 2.8 after playing it 2-player, where there is marginally more strategy and opportunity to influence the game.

Pubblicato nel 1985 ed è ancora ai nostri giorni un gioco molto carino (poi se lo paragoniamo con gli altri del suo tempo!) ed molto meglio di tanti nuovi e piace a tutti. Semplice nella spiegazione e nello svolgimento. La tattica prefissata è difficile da imporre, perché può essere stravolta dalle tattiche degli avversari nel corso della partita. Ovviamente c'è la componente fortuna. Bello il fatto di cercare le possibili strade per arrivare agli animali... e dover cambiare tutto alla mossa successiva. Infine ha insegnato a molti l'esistenza di animali sconosciuti. Consigliatissimo!

A big map of the world made pretty simple with laying where you want to travel to next.  Pretty simple and light way to travel the world looking for matches to your animals.  Fun family game with kids & adults alike.

I had played Expedition previously and liked it, so when I saw WA at a local thrift I snatched it up.  I'm glad I did - I like it even more.  The endangered animal aspect is interesting to fill the down time between turns and the chance cards help to move things along.  Fun game.

RATING: 7.5
this is a fun little filler game with a bit of a TransAmerica feel with a great theme but my only complaint  is it feels like the ending gets dragged on when multiple players have one card.  It feels like it's more trying to avoid others from doing anything rather than finishing the game so it can draw a little longer than necessary at the end.   Other than that a solid game and great for its time.

Another game anyone and everyone can play. laying route markers to traverse the globe and save endangered animals. what's not to love. Can be brutal when your fellow player insists on taking 'your' color off on another path. 

Dropped rating as this doesn’t get to the table w so many other games to play.

Actually better than Expedition, I think, because it's tighter, less mobile, and it's easier to screw your opponent. Makes the whole "keeping your destination a secret" thing much more important, makes the game more psychological.

I bought this game for a few dollars for my wife solely because of the theme.  It turned out to be a very pleasant, very tactical connection game.  Given my predilection for rail games, it is no surprise that I enjoy this.  I would really like to play with more than two, though, as it seems it would make tactical play even more important.

Oh boy, what fun. Sure there is a lot of luck to set-up to the game, but I love the way the everything plays out.  You have just enough options to feel that your decisions are making a difference and just enough control to feel that you can overcome your set up.  This game works nicely as you set up chained forced plays or as least encouraged plays to help yourself out.  There is a reason why this has been around for so long, it is just a damn fine family game.

I think you would have to play it a few times to gain enough experience to know where most animals are on the board.  I'm not enamored with most path-finding games and having to constantly figure out where all the animals are adds another layer of difficulty that isn't enjoyable.  I do like the artwork, it is educational, plays fairly quickly, and I can see where children might enjoy it too, so I wouldn't turn down a game.

What a fun game, even if I'm always a little sad wondering how many of those animals are still around since this game came out.  The first few come easy and then suddenly you're looking at traveling around the world to pick up an endangered monkey.  Good for family and gamers, just deal out fewer cards for the former.

Players aim to extend various expeditions such that they visit the specific map locations matching their hand cards.

The parallels between Wildlife Adventure and TransAmerica never occurred to me until now, but there you have it.  The treks in WA are directional, though, so new path extensions can only be added to the ends of expeditions - not any old place.  I prefer the updated Expedition myself, primarily because the random card benefits are eliminated.

One problem shared by WA and Expedition is that both are overly chaotic once they hit the five- or six-player mark.  Possibly best with two, though up to four players is reasonable.

a very good game even for 2-players. you can create your strategy since the beginning as it is only up to you to use all of your resources in the best way in order to be the first in turn which IMHO makes a big difference. I really loved the bidding phases.

An enjoyable game of bidding and area control. It seems like there are plenty of paths to victory, which is always enticing. Don't let one person run away with controlling the events, as you'll be sadly surprised at the end when they have hordes of Res Publica tokens. I hope to get a few more plays out of this one... it's one of the better Ystari games released so far.

I like Ystari games, so I was hoping for more from this one. On paper it looks ok, but it's fiddly, quite ugly and not much fun. The game plays itself, you can't control much of what's happening, you just hope to catch some victory points on the way. There's a lot of bidding, but there's no tension, it's not like you care too much for what you bid.

From the Reviews: This game fell under the radar in '08, partly due to the hype of Dominion. Plays 3-4 in 60 minutes with 2 player variant. Looks good and heavy with lots of interaction and the auctions don't feel to "auctiony". Many people like this game and feel that it is seriously underrated, many others seem to have a difficult time understanding the game.

It implements elements such as auction, drafting, voting and they are clearly there.

Most of the times it would get one play per game night and not more.

It just seems it is lacking a special something.

Not a bad game though by any means, nice design, concept and idea.

I am not sure who much or how little your decisions affect the other players every time.

Cant quite place it somewhere , I will keep my gut feeling to neutral on this one.

This is a very specific game, with lots of auctioning and quite abstract overall. The game play is consistent, it's just not my type of game, although I can recognized the game's value. It has its own little flows, but for people who like auctioning it could be an entertaining experience.

Sylla is an interesting design that features a number of mechanisms that can, at times, be interesting to think about.  And to its credit, I cannot think of another game, in the aggregate, quite like Sylla. 

Nevertheless, in the aggregate, following my first play, this game felt very artificial and fiddly.  It is as if the designer put together a list of mechanism he wanted to include in his game, then tried to interlock them in as many ways as possible in seven, my goodness, phases, in each of five rounds, then added a theme.  You kind of march through the phases of the game without any rhythm or particular, evident thematic logic.

Thematically, I just did not feel the connection at all.  Why do only virgins and legionnaires get to vote on events?   Why can virgins vote on only certain events, and not others?  Huh?

Yet, you could do worse than Sylla.  A lot of recent Feld designs, for example, are transparently just mechanics mixed with more mechanics, with theme, obviously being a very distant concern.  And the Sylla mechanics - auctions, stock market shares with fluctuating values, buildings that affect game play, multiple currencies, one-two-three reveal results - are roughly comparable in amusement value to many popular Feld mechanics.  So, meh, it is hard to completely dismiss Sylla.

Clever game of auctioning, voting, and political jockeying that works well with the theme. The many different ways to use the same resources leads to some really tough decisions. Engaging throughout because of player interaction and never really knowing who will win until the end.

One thing I didn't like was the blind bidding where you lose the resources you bid even if you don't place first or second.

RATING: 7
Ystari has a knack for games that intertwine several mechanics to build a bigger picture.  The mechanics don't always stack; some are at odds with each other while others create interesting combinations.  That is exactly what happens in this game.  There are several elements that all connect - sometimes directly; sometimes indirectly.  The experience can leave players looking at the game as a hodgepodge of components and it visually can have that effect, but game play is quite a bit more connected and flows better than one would expect until one plays the game.  A solid offering that has interesting options but gives a sense of lacking some development and final refinements.

I approached this game when I heard it was some sort of Republic of Rome light, but still a serious gamer's game. In fact, the gameplay is totally different from Republic: the mechanics are pure 'Euro' and elegantly interwoven, simple but definitely they give the players the chance to play different strategies. It's not nearly an historic-accurate simulation as RoR, but it's a lot easier to understand and play!
The only flaw of the game is probably the production: the quality of the artwork is really poor (this is a problem with other Ystari titles I own...), and the whole look of the game doesn't seem very 'roman'...

I really think that's a pity that this game is not really good-looking because it had a lot of qualities.
First, it's an eurogame with a lot of interactivity, there is some voting and bidding during the game. And you can try to influence your opponent.
The rules of the game are really easy. There is a lot of phase but each phase is very simple to resolve, usually it's a bidding or a vote.
If you are looking for a eurogame different than a worker placement game, take a look at this game.

Only my second Ystari to date and a very good introduction too. A nice balancing act and a difficult set of decisions about where to spend your resources. Even the 3 decks of buildings make the decisions harder, because all of the good engine-makers come out at the start and all the big point grabbers at the end.

Somebody used the phrase wheels-within-wheels about Ystari and it is certainly apt for this game. Every phase is a mini game in itself. Will definitely be playing again.

Update: Beginning to doubt my first assessment a little. I thought there were several paths to victory here but now I am not so sure - the first consul is more powerful than first appearances suggest.

Update: 3rd game after a long gap. Scratch the 2nd update, there are at least a couple of paths to victory.

A euro, but with a theme that fits ... got a bit of blind bidding, but it works with the theme (like the thumb up/down) got a bit of draft, got a bit of multiple routes to victory, got some random events.

RATING: 8
La partida se realiza en cinco turnos (más un turno final) y cada turno se divide en 7 fases. Elección de cónsul, elección de edificios, construcción de edificios, obtención de dinero, construcción de maravillas, desastres y por ultimo control del hambre y revueltas. Cada jugador dispone de una serie de personajes (cartas) con los que debe escoger qué acciones realizar. Una vez que se utiliza un personaje no se puede volver a usar en ese turno, por lo que hay un coste de oportunidad importante. Cada jugador tiene una pantalla para ir acumulando de forma oculta contadores de tres tipos (cultura, ocio, y salud, o algo así). Esos contadores al final de la partida se valoran según una tabla de multiplicadores que es alterada por los desastres o ciertos edificos. Los jugadores compiten entre sí, pero también deben colaborar para evitar que los desastres (que normalmente perjudican a todos) se produzcan (hay 4 y siempre se producen al menos 2). Incluye dos fases de subastas. Es un juego dificil de explicar y de entender debidamente a la primera, porque incluye muchos parámetros a tener en cuenta y todos relacionados entre sí, pero es un gran juego.

The first real mismatch between Ystari and my game tastes.  I'm sure it's a lovely little game for those who don't hate auctions with a fiery passion, but unfortunately I detest auctions, and auctions of one sort of another (with money, building power, or cubes) pretty much make up the game.  There's also a big rich-get-richer effect -- the First Consul is very powerful, and if you get an early lead on money then you put yourself in a strong position to repeatedly take First Consul.  If you get behind early in income generation (as I did) it's extremely difficult to catch up.

This is a typical euro-fare with multiple scoring paths that is meant to have a zero-sum. It's themeless and soulless.

Having the most chits of the most valuable colour at endgame seems to dominate above all else.

Nothing offensive here, but I don't see myself requesting this one to be played.

Based on 1 play with 3 players:

Messed up quite a few rules over the course of our first game. Made the game take way longer than it felt like it should have. Bad rulebook, bad!

The auctioning system in this game is great. The currency required for the buildings and the way you select new character cards every round work together really well. I love the way most cards are used for multiple things, so you always feel like to get something good you're going to have to give something else you really want up later.

For some reason, we all ignored the Res Publica tokens/track in our game so I really need to play again to see how viable a strategy this is. Also I'm not sure I understand the point of ever bothering to not invest in a Great Works... seems like it might make more sense to do in a four player game though.

I dig the way events are handled and the risk management involved.

Even though this game has a bunch of systems that work well, and, even interestingly, the game just feels like it lacks soul. I'd be interested in trying this again but I can't imagine ever truly loving it when there are so many games available that have interesting mechanics AND personality.

Meh, this felt like just another average euro – not a good thing. There are so many excellent eurogames out there, but this one felt a little dated without many interesting decisions. Sure, it has some unique features such as the bidding in the first round where you’re using your cards, and as you also want these cards in later rounds as they also provide income/votes/other stuff, you need to balance your resources.
Famine increased drastically at the beginning of the game, and that seemed a little weird; it meant that if you didn’t buy any farms and solely focused on collecting chits, you could hit 0 points pretty quickly and then go all in on chits which can yield a massive amount of points at the end of the game! What is positive is that it seems that there are various strategies.

Excellent, multiple currency, card drafting and auction game. The highlights of Sylla are the devilish take-that auction situations and the formation of temporary alliances. An easy game to teach, but not an easy game to play well, with no apparent dominant strategy. This is a gamers game, that needs multiple plays to be appreciated. Elegant, with a lot of nuances and finesse.

On the negative side the art is uninspiring, imo, and it would have been nice to have more variety in terms of building tiles and event cards. 

The official 2p variant misses the alliances and aligned interests component of the multiplayer version, but the game is still engaging, thinky and tense.

A criminally underrated game. Grab a copy while it is cheap and available.

I had a devil of a time locating a playable copy of this game at Spiel 2008 that I was almost afraid I'd return home without playing an Ystari title there. But perseverence eventually paid off. Sylla is a weird game, and hard to describe as there is just so much going on. Thematically, players are trying to work towards their own ends in ancient Rome, but are forced to cooperate to some extent too in order to deal with major civic crises which [i]could[/i] see the weakest player lose hard-earned influence. But it's not a 'true' coop at all: it's about converging and diverging interests. It looks like it has a snowball engine in it—namely with the cards—but it doesn't, not really. Cards enter the game far too quickly and evenly for things to be a genuine snowball, but still there are some effects which are cumulative and will last you through the entire game. There's some blind bidding in it, some card tapping, tons of achieving as much as possible with limited resources, and more.

To date I played two games, and after both the feeling I got from Sylla was the same. This game is far too much about 'doing stuff' and exploiting game machinery  than enjoying playing, playing well, or relaxing in the satisfaction you owned your opponents through a strategy which paid off quite sneakily. This is caused by the top-heavy and very 'dense' feel: there's a large amount of mechanisms (bidding, blind bidding, card tapping, some cooperation, hand management, ...) and little tricks rolled into one design which all play out in about an hour or slightly over that. The result does not have a nice simple flow to it; instead it feels slow, complex and overwrought at all occasions. Sylla appears to burst a seam at any moment; instead of focusing on a few simpler aspects and exploiting the finesses, the game forces you to focus on them all and then doesn't seem to care whether you make them work for you or not. 

In the introduction of the game I can read that its development was a long and painful process, with lots of iterations when it came to subject matter: personally I feel that should have been a sign to the developers that the game did not work as intended. Quite unusual for an Ystari design, but it felt like a major let-down, and in hindsight a wasted effort in tracking down a playable copy. In all honesty the game seems to work and will probably, with a little time and effort, result in plays which some people will find appealing and interesting. Unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. In fact, I will positively try to avoid this game in the future.

A very solid game with a decently integrated ancient Roman theme.  Players represent consuls trying to improve their standing in the eyes of the people while keeping the peace, which requires balancing health, leisure, civic spirit and famine.

The main thrust of the game is three sets of auctions - two are open (bidding for first player, and for helpful buildings) while the the third is secret (voting to construct a great work).  There is a unique mechanism of events that you choose to try and prevent in order to keep the people happy and save yourself from negative consequences.

Out of the games I've played in the Ystari series, this felt like the one that nailed the right balance of a lot of things going on without feeling too complex.  Teaching the game is a bit of a challenge, but once you get the flow it moves at a brisk pace.  Definitely looking to get this to the table again soon.

First of all: this is not Republic of Rome lite.

So what is Sylla? A clever game with lots of auctions and subtle ways to hinder your opponents. 
Gameplay is tense and pretty quick.
Good game.

Bumping up from a 6 to a 7.  Yes, the tokens are very important.  Just had a game where I focused completely on tokens and won.  However, another player focused heavily on senators and finished fairly close.  I think this may be a game where you need to focus instead of being a "jack of all trades".

It's different than a lot of games I've played recently.  I'd be happy to play it again, but that said I'm not sure it is that memorable.  There's some good tradeoff decisions to be made in the game...do I use my people to vote, collect money, or add influence.  But it feels a lot of the actions are more background noise to the key part of the game...collecting the valuable tokens.

Players are powerbrokers in the Roman Republic, jostling to take over from Sulla when he "retires".  Players draft cards that allow them to either bid on buildings or use them for their function later in the turn.  Bids are "tapped", denying their use until next turn.  Cards and buildings allow you to acquire stuff - money, victory points, Res Publica chips (basically shares in points at the end of the game), and disaster cubes.  Tons of stuff going on in here - elections, bids, builds, fighting disasters, in the fist bidding, and so on.  Fortunately, it all seems to work quite well, and I enjoyed it.  Downsides - graphically dubious, feels very much like a Ystari game so you'll either love it or not, and why on earth are "Christians" in this game, if it's set in the time of Sulla?

It can be a fine line between a hopelessly conventional rewash of old mechanisms, and a creative implementation of old mechanisms that adds something new. Sylla walks that line, and for some reason feels on the better side of the line. 

For one thing, I found the variable powers of the differenct roles interesting. And the auctions have some interesting dynamics involved, dynamics that are completely different from any other auctions'.

Ystari games are definitely a style that one either likes or not as they are usually a mish-mash of mechanics with some camels thrown. I seem to be predisposed towards them for the most part and find their requirement to spin a lot of plates at the same time to be perfectly entertaining whereas others will call them soulless. 

Sylla is another plate spinner and one I like for the different paths to victory among a tightly constrained game space.  You're trying to get in-game points while fending off events that will F up your infrastructure while collecting (and improving the value of) chits that effectively work like stocks. I've won going with senators and having lots of votes and I've won by eschewing them altogether and going for legionnaires and virgins and controlling the events. Either way is a battle with difficult decisions on how to spend your resources each turn. 

Your cards (and you get at least one more each turn) offer you different colored icons to use as currency but once you tap one of your cards (for one of their colors), they're done for the entire turn. As there are 7 phases, you have to be very careful about when you tap yourself out as you can end up quite vulnerable. At the same time, the right purchase at the right time can put the pressure on other players (especially as regards fields).

Disappointed with its unnecessary complexity for essentially mundane processes.

Played once and it took pretty long. It was a first play but there is a lot to think about on the board.  Each auction is once around so it helps the play time but it's fairly thinky.   That was with four, I'd like to try it with three and it might move better.  Otherwise I loved the artwork and the look of the game when it's set up.  Nice big cards as well.  As usual with Ystari games, I had to work hard to figure out the multiple mechanics going on.  I wish their designs were simpler- I always end their games not quite getting what that one track on the end does...  Better than Amyitis which I never did figure out.

after 3 games I have to say that this is the best Ystari game after Caylus. It was one of the few times when I play a boardgame where it struck me how difficult and time consuming it must have been to interwhine and balance the different game mechanisms. It's great how the things you do in one of the 7 phases of each of the 5 rounds, influence what you can do in the other phases. Understanding this and constantly observing the possibilities of your fellow players is the the key to victory.

Des stratégies très variées surtout pour un jeu aussi court. Du rythme malgré des choix complexes. Des règles super claires. Un jeu qui met tout le monde d'accord comme étant un bon jeu (sans forcément personne qui le trouve épique). 

A quatre c'est plus brouillon et ça marque peut être un peu de rythme mais pas sur avec des habitués rapides. Quelques équilibrages bizarres (famine hautes / res publica basse) qui donnent une impression pré-apocalyptique très BG mais étonnante mécaniquement.

Je n'ai jamais vu de partie moyenne; toujours une bonne à très bonne expérience.

RATING: 4
This game was a big let down for me... Based on some descriptions I was hoping for some Ystari goodness with a take-that aspect to it. It's far from that. At its core this game is a long stream of biddings: for first player, for buildings, for victory points, for events... Some use single-turn bidding, others use blind bidding. Some ask for money, other use special "card currency". Unfortunately, all of them are bland. Tension never builds up.

This is also a typical market game: you collect "resources" that will have different payouts at the end. Unfortunately, this fails to inject tension since the market fluctuate erratically. I blame this on the fact that people with few resources of a given type don't want the market to go up OR down! This is because you get hosed if you have only a few tokens when the maket hits rock bottom.

For me, this is easily the worst offering from Ystari, and I really enjoyed almost everything else they published.

I'm starting to see a pattern with Ystari games, at least if you can call a hodgepodge of mechanics a pattern. Like the other games in the same vein (Amyitis and Nefertiti come to mind) the design is solid, it works well, and everything fits nicely together. It does, however, not stick out of the crowd.

Interesting use of multiple interlocking mechanics.  It is all fairly thematic for a Ystari game.

So far the worst game by Ystari. It doesn't mean it's a bad game - it simply doesn't reach the high standards of their other titles. After the play I feel tired and I don't care whether I won or lost. And that's unforgivable.

The mechanics seems OK (although the game is rather dry and abstract) but the gameplay doesn't engage me emotionally. A standard eurogame for the fans of the genre.

Initially daunting setup but in fact the game flows well and it is easily understood and managed.  Many different paths to victory, and beautiful production makes this likely to hit the table once the Essen crop is played.  My only worry in the first game was that we were within 1 point of each other at the finish - if it doesn't matter what you do, you all score around the same then that would be off-putting - if in fact we were all playing equally well/badly then thats fine.  We will see.

Exactly what I've come to expect from Ystari: present the players with a big pile of game mechanisms, and ask them to sort and sift and shamble their way to a few victory points here and there.  No spark, no focus, no narrative, no tension.  Works perfectly well, but why bother?

This was a disappointment. Ystari are very uneven in their production. From the really great game like Amyitis to quite indifferent games as Metropolys and Sylla. Pretty abstract, with a couple of queer auction mechanisms. Ok, there are some new interesting thinkings in the mechanisms but they turn down to be quite abstract and it lacks fun. It's more like trying to save your butt as much as possible.

I am not a real Ystari fan, so maybe you shouldn't take my judgement too seriously if you are, but I don't find it particulary fun.

There is no spark in this game.

Played twice. At the moment I see it as just another euro game, this could well change if it gets more play. The decisions are plentiful and challenging and the options limited enough not to lock up play with analysis paralyses. However there are times in the game when you take up everyones time thinking on the possibilities only to realise that all options effect all of the players equally so you might as well decide randomly.

This is basically a series of auctions, with stock market for some of the scoring. Some mechanics seem to have been added just for thematic reasons and don't work quite well. Famine, for example, may reach the maximum level quickly, depending on starting event cards, and it tends to stay there, since there is only one card that may reduce it. Crises are another unnecessary part and I haven't seen any in my three plays. Overall, the game is still fine, but utterly unremarkable. The art from Arnaud Demaegd is beautiful, as usual, despite the unfortunate self-censorship required for the prudish American market.

Now this was a suprise. I never thought that this could be a good game, since noone ever mentioned or played it and Ystari sold it for cheap pretty fast. It also didn't look exciting, too.

So away from all that, it's a very interesting bidding game with quite some depth. If this doesn't get flooded by AP players, it's really good, as there are plenty of ways to play and win the game.

Of course it's not perfect, there could be more different cards and buildings, but that doesn't kill the game.

If you like tense bidding games and can get this one for cheap, take a look at it.

A well designed and intricately balanced game, which is also extremely dry and anti-climactic.  The game is a series of auctions, all of which end up contributing towards victory points.  There is also a VP token collection system, which awards people who don't participate in the VP auctions.  The event auction is a very original mechanism and there is some tension and strategy in auctioning off the buildings.  It all works together very well.  The components are nice and everything looks good.  One little complaint on the components is that the stack of buildings on the board is so tall you can't see everything.

That being said, the game suffers from a lot of "sameness."  Do you choose a merchant or a senator?  Since a dollar can be used as a vote, they aren't much different.  The great wonders of rome are all alike, and so the scoring each round has little variety.  The events are mostly all alike, giving you a token if you have the most and moving the token scoring track if you fail.  There are a couple of others, and there is some variety, but overall it isn't enough to keep me interested for more than a game or two a year.  

Like the last couple of Ys games I have played, this one feels like a bunch of mechanics thrown together, with a theme pasted on, and then carefully balanced, at the expense of variety and fun.

I was confused the first time I read the rules, but it was certainly me, a bad 'a priori' with Ystari game rules?  In fact, this is the best written set of rules in a Ystari game so far, and quite clear for its (manageable) complexity.

This game has a lot of neat ideas thrown into it. It also feels like it was designed with the "here is another neat idea" without a good way to make them cohesive. That's forgivable, but each round plays pretty much the same, and your choices aren't nearly as interesting as they should be. As a result it runs pretty long in the teeth. Add into that the game tends to bring out AP in people near the end, and you just can't wait for it to end.

All that said, it does have its strengths, but they are sadly affected by these weaknesses.

I think there is a certain tendency in many gamers (and definitely in me!) to overrate games that they own. To forestall cognitive dissonace: "if I bought it must be better than average". For instance, I hated Vasco de Gama but I'm hard pressed to objectively explain why it is worse than certain games that I own but don't mind.

Take Sylla, for instance. I think Sylla is a pretty good game. It is mostly a series of auctions along with some disaster-minimization. It has lots of complicated interlocking systems and doesn't have much of a "narrative arc": the game just sorta ends after 5 turns "because". Each of the subsystems -- drafting, auctions, "area control" -- are done better elsewhere.

When I break it down like that I can't help but think I am overrating this game just because *I* own it. Would I ever choose this over Chicago Express, for instance? Is it really better than Santiago?

RATING: 7
A játék öt fordulóból áll és minden fordulóban hét-hét fázis van. 
Ötféle karakterkártya van a játékban:
-	Szenátorok: szavazatokat adnak az első konzul választásánál és a nagy mű építésénél
-	Kereskedők: pénzt hoznak a IV. fázisban
-	Légionáriusok és Vesta-szűzek: a negatív események ellen tudnak küzdeni az V. fázisban
-	Rabszolgák: nincs különleges hatásuk, de a játék végén a rabszolga felszabadítás során 2-2 dénárért felszabadíthatjuk őket, így rabszolga kártyánként kaphatunk 3-3 dicsőség pontot.  
Minden kártyán látható egy-két (rabszolgák esetén három) színű hatszög, amikkel licitálni lehet majd az épületekért. 

A játék kezdetén minden játékos kap egy-egy (egyforma) készlet (tízlapos) kártyát, amelyekből titokban egyszerre kiválasztja a kezdő négy emberét.

Minden forduló elején felcsapunk 6 karakterkártyát és 6 épületet, illetve az első forduló előtt három eseménykártyát + az állandóan jelenlévő Hanyatlás eseménykártyát, valamint felcsapnak egy Nagy Művet, amit a VI. szakaszban építhetnek meg a játékosok. 

A játék során folyamatosan figyelniük kell a helyzetet Rómában: a Köztársaság létra mutatja az emberek aktuális elégedettségi helyzetét az egyes dolgokban: Polgári Szellem (lila jelző), Egészség (kék jelző), Szabadidő (zöld jelző) és Éhínség (sárga jelző). A Köztársaság jelzők középről indulnak és folyamatosan mozognak a krízis (bal oldal) és ideális (jobb oldal) között, míg az Éhínségjelző a 0-n kezd (balszél) és jobbra mozog, ahogy az éhínség rosszabbodik. A játék végén a Köztársaság korongok, a korong helyzetétől függően adnak pontokat a játékosoknak. A játék során az éhínség azon játékosoktól vesz el pontot, akik nem tudnak elég kenyeret adni a plebejusoknak (akik a római állampolgárok döntő részét adják). 

I.	fázis: Az Első Konzul megválasztása
Ez úgy történik, hogy az előző forduló Első Konzulja felajánl szavazatokat, hogy az új fordulóban is ő legyen az Első Konzul. Minden a játékos előtt arccal felfele levő Szenátor egy szavazatnak számít, valamint a Szenátorok mellé fizethet annyi dénárt, amennyit akar. Egy dénár egy szavazatnak számít. 
II.	fázis: Toborzás
Az Első Konzullal kezdve és az órajárása szerint haladva, minden játékos választ egy Karakter kártyát 
III.	fázis: Épületek beszerzése
Az Első Konzul választ egyet a felfordított hat Épület lapkából és felajánlja megvételre. Az értékesítési színt (piros, sárga vagy szürke) a lapka tábla szélén elfoglalt pozíciója határozza meg, és csak az a Karakter, akin rajta van ez a szín, tudja megvenni az épületet. Vagyis az értékesítési szín meghatározza, hogy mely Karakterek vehetik meg az épületet. Itt van jelentősége, hogy a karakter kártyáinkon milyen színű hatszögek vannak. Itt válik értékessé a különleges képességgel nem bíró rabszolga, mivel rajta mindhárom szín megtalálható. 

Az ajánlott összeg azon karakterek számával egyezik meg, amiken szerepel a megfelelő színű hatszög és a játékos arra szánja, hogy „elköltse”. Az óramutató járása szerint, és az Első Konzullal befejezve, mindenki egyszer ajánlhat vagy passzol. Ha mindenki passzol, akkor az épületet kikerül a játékból. Az a játékos, aki a legjobb ajánlatot tette megkapja az épületet és maga elé teszi. Az így felhasznált Karakter kártyák a forduló hátralévő részében már nem használható sem vásárlásra, sem a speciális tulajdonságaikat nem lehet használni.  
Az épületek különböző tulajdonsággal rendelkeznek

IV.	fázis: Jövedelem
Itt minden játékos dénárokat kap. Alapból kap mindenki 3 dénárt. Ha van olyan Kereskedő kártya, amely nincs elfordítva, az kereskedőnként 1-1 dénárt ér. Itt kapják meg a játékosok az Árusítóbódék utáni 2-2 dénárt, illetve ebben a fázisban tudja a Kocsma tulajdonosa mozgatni a Köztársaság jelzőket.

V.	 fázis: Események
A tábla jobb oldalán négy eseménykártya áll felfordítva. Ezek közül a legalsó a hanyatlás, ami állandó probléma Sulla korában, így kezdettől végig játékban marad; a többi kártya viszont akár eltüntethető – ha teszünk ellene. Minden eseménykártyán látható az esemény várható hatása; azon személyek jele, akik tenni tudnak ellene – ezek vagy légionáriusok vagy Vesta-szüzek, esetleg mindkettő – illetve a jutalom is, ami egy esemény elleni legaktívabb fellépésért jár.
-	Elhelyezés 
Minden játékos a saját színes kockájából egyet-egyet tesz minden Veszta Szűz és Légiós karakterére, amelyik nincs elfordítva. Az Első konzullal kezdve, majd az óramutató járásának megfelelően, minden játékosnak tennie kell egy kockát valamelyik esemény kártyára. A játékosok addig jönnek sorban, míg az összes kockájuk el nem fogy. 

-	Jutalom az esemény bekövetkezése elleni harcért
Az első 3 Esemény mindegyikén, az a játékos, akinek a legtöbb kockája van az adott eseménylapon nyer egy Köztársaság korongot a kártya által meghatározott színben. Ha több játékosnak van ugyanannyi kockája az első helyen, akkor ők mindannyian kapnak egy-egy Köztársaság korongot. A hanyatlás lapon többségben lévő játékos egy dicsőség pontot kap. 

-	Események bekövetkezése
Nem számít, hogy mennyi kocka van téve a kártyákra, két esemény mindenképp bekövetkezik és két esemény pedig nem. Az a két eseményt, amin a legtöbb kocka van azt sikerül megelőzni és nincs hatása ebben a fordulóban, viszont a másik két esemény megtörténik és a hatásukat végre kell hajtani. Ha az események közül többön ugyanannyi kocka van, akkor az Első konzul dönti el, hogy melyik eseményt sikerült megakadályozni és melyik történik meg.

Az az esemény, amelyiken a legtöbb kocka van (legtöbben léptek fel ellene) azt teljesen sikerült megelőzni és végleg távozik a játékból. Ha a két eseményen ugyanannyi kocka van, akkor az Első Konzul dönti el, hogy melyik távozzon a játékból. A Hanyatlás folyamatos probléma, azért azt nem lehet eltávolítani, ha a legtöbb jelző azon van, akkor a második legtöbb jelzővel ellátott eseményt kell eltávolítani és helyére új eseménykártyát csapunk fel.

Események
-	Járvány: az egészség jelölőt eggyel balra mozgatja. Van rajta éhínség jelző. A Vesta szűz léphet fel ellene. 
-	Kitörés: a szabadidő jelölőt eggyel balra mozgatja. A Vesta szűz léphet fel ellene.
-	Birodalom kultusz: a Polgári Szellem jelölőt egy mezővel balra mozgatja. A Légiós és a Vesta szűz is felléphet ellene. 
-	Éhínség: az éhínség jelzőt eggyel jobbra mozgatja. Van rajta éhínség jelző. A Vesta szűz léphet fel ellene.
-	Keresztényüldözés: minden játékos egy keresztény Karakterét arccal lefele forgatja. Ezen Karakterek, amíg az esemény a játékban van, nem csinálnak semmit. Csak a Légiós léphet fel ellene.
-	Szenátustisztogatás: minden játékos egy Szenátor kártyáját arccal lefele fordítja. Ezen Karakterek, amíg az esemény a játékban van, nem csinálnak semmit. Csak a Légiós léphet fel ellene.
-	Árvíz: minden játékos az épület lapkáiból egyet arccal lefele fordít. Ezen épületek hatása, amíg az Esemény a játékban van, nem érvényesül. Van rajta éhínség jelző. A Vesta szűz léphet fel ellene.
-	Rabszolga Lázadás: minden játékos egy Rabszolga karakterét arccal lefele fordítja. Ezen Karakterek, amíg az Esemény a játékban van, nem csinálnak semmit. Van rajta éhínség jelző, és csak a Légiós léphet fel ellene. 
-	Fosztogatás: minden játékos az Árusítóbódé lapkáiból egyet arccal lefele fordít. Ezen épületek hatása, amíg az Esemény a játékban van, nem érvényesül. Van rajta éhínség jelző, és csak a Légiós léphet fel ellene.
-	Hanyatlás: azon jelző (vagy jelzők), ami a Köztársaság skála jobb oldalától a legmesszebb van, 1 mezőt mozog balra. 

VI.	fázis: Nagy Mű építése
Ezen fázis során a játékosok közösen létrehozzák azt a Nagy Művet, ami a pakli tetején van, bár dönthetnek úgyis, hogy nem vesznek részt a projektben, inkább népszerűsítik maguk a plebejusok körében. Itt szimultán szavazás és licit dönt: kezünkbe veszünk annyi pénzt, amennyit a nagy műre áldoznánk (mind egy szavazatot jelent, a szenátoraink meg plusz egyet-egyet), majd középre tartjuk a kezünket vízszintesen kinyújtott mutatóujjal, amit vezényszóra vagy le-, vagy felfelé fordítunk el. A lefordított hüvelykujj azt jelenti, hogy nem akarunk részt venni az építkezésben, inkább a népnek akarunk adakozni: ilyenkor minden két szavazatunkért egy dicsőségpontot nyerünk. Felfelé fordított ujjal az építkezésben veszünk részt, amit a kártyán írtak szerint értékelünk. 

Miden nagy műnek külön hatása van a játékra

VII.	fázis: Éhínség és krízis
Megnézzük, milyen szintű az éhínség (mert, ezt minden forduló elején valamennyivel megnöveltük az aktuális események függvényében), és mindenki veszít annyi dicsőségpontot. De ha van szántóföldje, akkor mezőnként 2 presztízsponttal kevesebbet veszít. 

Ha egy Köztársaság Jelző (Egészség, Polgári Szellem vagy Szabadidő) a Válság Zónába kerül, akkor olyan típusú politikai krízis jön létre. Ilyenkor az összes játékosnak meg kell mutatnia az adott színnek megfelelő Köztársaság korongjait. Azon játékos vagy játékosok, akinek a legtöbb korongja van, azonnal kap 3 dicsőség pontot, míg azon játékos vagy játékosok, akinek a legkevesebb korongja van, azonnal veszít 3 dicsőség pontot (az emberek őt teszik felelőssé a krízisért).

Ekkor véget ér a forduló. A játéknak az ötödik forduló után van vége. A hatodik Nagy Mű (Ecclesia) is megvalósul, a következő hatásokkal: 

● Kereszténység eljövetele 
Minden keresztény karakter (hallal jelölt), ami arccal felfele van (mégha el is van fordítva), ami a játékos területén van 2 dicsőség pontot ér a játékosnak. 
● Rabszolgák felszabadítása 
A játékosok felszabadíthatják az arccal felfele levő rabszolgáikat (mégha azok el is vannak fordítva) ha fizetnek 2 dénárt rabszolgánként. Minden felszabadított rabszolga 3 dicsőség pontot hoz a játékosának. 
● Politikai eredmény 
A játékosok felfedik a Köztársaság korongjaikat. A megfelelő jelző pozíciója a Köztársaság létrán, megadja a dicsőség pontok számát, amit minden adott korong után megkap a játékos.

Az első játékunk szabályolvasgatással (úgyhogy előtte már olvastuk) 1:49 óra lett: Sylla első játék Amúgy 1-1,5 óra alatt lejátszható a játék a 35 fázisával és végső értékelésével együtt. A játékszabály így kezdődik: „A Sylla fejlesztése különösen hosszú és fájdalmas volt, miközben átmentünk sok témán, többé vagy kevésbé bonyolult mechanikán és szakadatlan állítgattunk rajta, hogy tökéletesen kiegyensúlyozott játékot kapjunk.” Ez meg is látszik raja, egyes részeket nyilván utólag építettek a játékban. Hiszen a játékban vannak licit, vak licit, munkáselhelyezés, események, különleges épületek, kártyák. Tehát többféle játék belefért a Syllába, éppen ezért a győzelemhez többféle út vezet. 
Sylla egy összetett, de nem bonyolult játék. Kezdőknek nem ajánlanám, viszont gyakorlottabb társasozók jó eséllyel tetszeni fog.

Played it for a second time. Explaining went smoother.

I totally screwed up pretty much the whole game. My wife did almost everything right. She won by like 20 points.

I really like how interconnected everything is. I also like how the events can be influenced more by controlling who has what characters and buildings and cares about what events. It makes the building auctions and character drafting much more interesting.

It went out the door.  Just way too many rules for such a compact game.  It was too ponderous to get to the table.  Oh well.

Solid hybrid game of simple deck building, bidding and voting. It is possible to follow different strategies. Excellent concept and can be playable with two players, if you follow the 2-players-variant from Ystari.

I regret why i didn't tried to learn it before while it is standing between my boardgames for 5 months. Sylla is surprisingly beautiful.

Can't wait to play again!

Another Ystari middleweight. Multiple auctions, multiple currencies, multiple commodities...essentially a  speculation / stock-holding game. Wrapped really well in the Ancient Rome theme (which is typically worth about +1 point for me!). The game exerts continuous pressure on everything the players value, with limited opportunity for them to make big gains. The expansion blends in seamlessly, though drafting an early philosopher seems almost a no-brainer.

EXCELLENT.  The game is complex, different strategies are possible, difficult choices are present, resources are VERY limited - all that a hardcore gamer likes :-)  .

  On the other hand it's really fresh design, not comparable to anything that I know.  I really like several new concepts from here like multiple possibilities of using some resources, fighting disasters etc.

Extremely high replayability - each gameplay can look _TOTALLY_ different because of the configuration of disasters.

EDIT: The replayabilty is not infinite, however.  Rating slightly down.

RATING: 7
Exactly what we've come to expect from Ystari, a fairly solid Euro game that lacks a soul which can be a big sin for some people. 

Although gameplay is not overly compelling or gripping due to the usual lack of theme and other offences, there were lots of little things to watch out for in the game and multpile paths to pursue and these things kept it interesting and made up for the other shortfalls for me. 

I did not like the blind Cuba style voting (auction) where the loser still has to pay what he bid but the effect here was much less than in Cuba so not too bad overall.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2015)

Good game. It has a very low luck factor and I almost always appreciate this. Sylla is a bidding game at its heart. You bid for everything with money or cards, but there are interesting decisions (medium weight) to be found, basically, for which kind of cards will I bid (character, building, event) and how will I pay for it (slaves, senators, virgins, legionaries or money). You also bid to be the first player and also bid at the end of each round to win VPs. I love the setup phase in which players all have the same set of characters but they have to choose a limited amount, this keeps the game fresh and repayable.

I love the events, in each round there are two events (from a total of four) that will occur and they can be devastating to your plans. Many times you need to “convince” other players to help you prevent a particular event, this fight is tense and fun. Other source of tension are the Res Republica tokens, they represent VPs at the end of the game according to a table (which is very fun to manipulate) AND they also serve in-game as VPs generators/punishment due to crisis. These tokens are hidden for most of the game adding a memory element I really enjoy. Also thank to this, you are never sure who is winning as many points will be awarded at the end. For last, there is a third source of tension, each round there will be famine and it can punish unprepared players. All things considered, I love all of this.

The theme isn’t to my liking, but some of the mechanisms do support it. The art is merely ok and the player screens are very regular (although they achieve their purpose).

I dislike that there is no tiebreaker.

Bottom line, Sylla is a borderline 7.0 to me (a good game I’m usually willing to play) but it could fall with more plays. It is a keeper in my game collection.

One of 2008´s favorites.

I was afraid with this one, but it offers 3 different kinds of auction in which players have few options to bid. This makes it an interesting game. Pure euro with enough interaction.

The theme is located some decades before Christ... and some characters begin the game being followers of Christ! I know that an eurogame does not ask for a high historical flavour, but a better congruence must be required.

RATING: 6
Half a game in I just found Sylla to be a boring assembly of game mechanisms and was decided to sell it. In the second half the game picked up a bit and even my money strategy which I considered doomed didn't fail as miserably as I expected. It wasn't enough for a win but under more beneficial circumstances it might have been. Point demonstrated: there are multiple ways to victory. More plays have to proof if underlying strategies can decide the game or if tactical optimization is more responsible, i.e. get easy VPs in uncontested areas while others fight for different VPs. 
The game didn't convince me and still has to prove if it is more than just one more of the often despised soulless Euros. The Ystari graphics don't help as they are as deterrent as usual.

I'm starting to get a little tired of Ystari games after this one and Amyitis.  This could just be a personal thing, but I would prefer simpler/shorter (like Metropolys, Mykerinos and Yspahan) or simply a more intuitive game flow (like Caylus).

Perhaps it's good to have a game that's not easily figured out after one play, but with so many games, the first play needs to leave a very positive impression.  There are a lot of different things going on and it's hard to figure out what exactly is responsible for a player winning or losing.

Also, another really boring theme.

RATING: 8.5
One of the best bidding games I've played in a long while. The system is a little convoluted, but the double use of bidding cards and the struggle to balance the various roles is a real treat. Everything just seems to be intertwined and flows pretty well.

I did not like the bonuses handed out for endgame scoring, it didn't feel like it made much sense (freeing slaves, and owning Christians?). Very weird thematically. Components are so-so, art was great, and this is definitely one of the more unique games on the market.

A game themed around ancient Rome, taking different parts from different centuries. Theme isn't strong and the game has a somewhat forced mechanical feel. The different mechanisms don't really feel like fitting together. Also, there are some minor non-functioning features that might have needed a bit more tweaking before publishing. On the plus side, there definitely are both strategic and tactical levels and luck isn't a deciding factor.

With a handful of things that give end game points, there's a lot to consider.  Multiple paths to victory, multiple strategies.

Well done, Ystari!

RATING: 7
Is it hand management? Is it a market game? Auction game? Is it worker placement? Is it a card game? Area control? A stock game? Emerging from some strange netherworld where amorphously fun board games are crafted by enslaved dwarves is Sylla, which I really enjoyed in my first play.

If I had to pick one of the aforementioned genres, I'd go with stock game, but it's so themey that it's sort of well hidden. Basically, you accumulate these cards that you can tap for various purposes: to bid on buildings that give you advantages, use as multipliers for other cards' powers, use to place cubes in a little area control bit towards the end of each of the five stages. A lot of the events and the area control subgame give you tokens that earn you VPs at the end. There are a couple of ways to manipulate the value of each token on this slider. I'm probably making it sound a lot more obscure and complicated than it actually is, but there is a lot going on, it's a very busy design, sort of the TI3 of simple, smooth-playing euros in that there're just a lot of little parts. But the board knows what the games challenges are and everything reminds you of key facts with simple iconography (like the 1 VP you get for an untapped gladiator in Stage IV of every year). It's not fussy, the auctions are vicious, and overall, Sylla's just a clever, well-integrated design.

Based on one play. Well this game has some different mechanics working together. However everything feels rather chaotic and long term strategy seems difficult. Indeed a solid game and easy to learn, but not so entertaining..

RATING: 7.5
Wheels within wheels, so overall strategy is not obvious.

The process of learning how a game of Sylla can develop (over 5 games with the same players) was great fun.

Now that I understand how the game develops, I'm somewhat disappointed that the movement of the value of each Res Publica token is less variable than I thought: it drops rather quickly, gets a big boost on the turn when the one particular Great Work associated with it happens to appear from the deck, but then drops rather quickly again unless the game ends before it can fall back to join the others.  Therefore I think there is too much unmitigated luck, favoring someone with lots of a token whose associated Great Work happens to come up near the game end.

This game is quite nice, mechanically, and offers plenty of choices and player interaction. There are a million things you want to do with your limited resources, so there's a real challenge in trying to balance your perceived needs vs. the amount of competition you are getting from other players in various areas.

This was one of those games where I seemed to almost accidentally make the wisest decisions possible more often than not, earning a victory that surprised me more than anyone.

This is the first time I've felt a bidding mechanic actually worked well with two players.  There's a careful balance of how many characters to burn during the building phase versus how many to save for their special abilities.  That along with the interesting tracks (such as famine) and events really make for a tight and enjoyable game.

Sylla proved too mechanical, dry and boring, and I was praying for the end to come about halfway through the game - unfortunately, the game doesn't reward Christians until the end of the game...;-)  Never again.

- The family seems to have no desire to play it: "Sylla?  I don't care about that guy."
+ After reading the rules and many reviews, I really feel like the theme and the rules really go hand in hand.
+ The rulebook was an easy read.  The board probably helps following the different turn phases.
- The simultaneous thumb vote seems like a nice change in pace, compared to many other games (even Race for the Galaxy and 7 Wonders simultaneous action selection).

Summary of my feelings:
+ Flows nicely
+ I like the variety of buildings, events and great works
- I didn't feel much tension…
- … maybe because I was trying to explain the game, because I was trying to give thematic interpretations of every game action that we were doing…
- … and because I don't yet fully grasp the strategy of the game.  In fact, I'm not yet sure what people to recruit.  And more generally, I did not have time to develop much strategy beyond trying to secretly push the Res Publica marker for the markers I already had.
+ I like the way theme and mechanics are connected.
$ I feel that the game might be better with 4 players: maybe the battles for First Consul, buildings and Great Works are fought harder.
+ The rules were not too hard: E understood them quickly enough.

The duality of the buildings as a resource/function is really tough, and is truly the central mechanism. I don't think the central stock market mechanism is as predictable or manageable as it is in Ys, but this game seems to be more about volume than value.

It's worth playing, and even owning, but I think for many it will be a straight split between love and hate.

RATING: 7
A unique economic game where you have various types of supporters with different color values for use in auctions.  You can tap these supporters to enable you to gain buildings that provide income or other abilities.  You then have a blind auctions where you try to build a great building.  Based on how people vote, the building can be built or not and you score points based on how you vote.  Lastly there is a majority control game where you are placing tokens to address crises.  You gain additional tokens if you address problems in Rome.

The game mechanics are very good.  However, the theme is a bit silly, it is 78 BC and there are Christians?! in the game.  Also, the decadence card has a dancer which will put off many family oriented people from playing.  The game is very good though.  You will find it a unique Euro with clever mechanics and finishes in a  reasonable amount of time.

RATING: N/A
first game.
made two rule mistakes - we thought you had to tap your senators to vote for consul
also we did not eliminate an Event from the game when Decadence had the majority, which happened alot because of the way players with soldiers were basically forced to vote for Decadence.

Still with all the mistakes we made I thought the game was excellent mainly because of the strong theme.

Theme would be even better if different art choices were made (I am tempted to re make the board myself):
Eg, 
Overall the board is too muddy and dark. 
 The  ‘crisis’ icon on the res publica ladder is hard to see.
Since the res publica track is supposed to represent the mood of the people it  should have been overlaid on artwork depicting a crowd, happy on one end and dispairing on the other.

The famine track and the res publica track should go in the same direction (better to worse left to right).

The iconography for the res publica tokens (eg leisure is represented by a sword icon?) and the degradation of rome event card are non-intuitive.

The tavern tile does not make thematic sense nor does the effect of the volcanic eruption.

Game needs a first consul token.

A szabályt először olvasva az volt az érzésem, hogy a játék komplexitása fogja majd megölni az élvezetet, de nem.

Komplexnek komplex, de nem veszélyes, csak egyszer kell végigküzdeni magunkat a játék összes mechanizmusán (mert az aztán van neki jó néhány), a második kör már egészen gyors és érthető lesz.

Kicsit száraznak tűnt elsőre, ráadásul sok mechanizmuson érződött, hogy csak azért került bele, hogy bonyolítsa a játékot és nagyobb agymunkára késztesse a játékosokat. Amivel lehet, hogy ezúttal túltolták kicsit...

Igazából kellene még játszani vele, mert még az is lehet, hogy masterpiece, csak ez elsőre nem jött le. (Ráadásul egy ráerőszakolt két játékos játékszabályzat alapján játszottunk, simán lehet, hogy 3-4 játékossal klasszisokkal jobb lenne.)

Kezdőknek egyáltalán nem ajánlom, mert csak sírás lenne belőle (életkortól függetlenül).

UPDATE (2017.03.06.): Másodszor már csillogtatta értékeit a játék, egyre inkább tetszik. A fórumon találtam egy szóló módot, azzal is egészen jó volt.

Sylla is a subtle game, where first impressions turn out to be incorrect and aspects that seem obvious end up being difficult to penetrate. A cursory play with the wrong group will cause this game to come off as nothing more than an exercise in resource management driven through auction after auction. Pretty boring stuff, right?

After a few plays, I'm happy to say Sylla has quite a bit more going for it. Here's what I like:

1. Every game is surprisingly different. It's hard to appreciate after one play, but something as small as removing just one Great Work from the game has a huge effect on how each game plays out. The random order in which the Events and Buildings come out shape the arc of each game. Sometimes famines are huge; other times they seem insignificant. Sometimes, everyone has cash all game long; other times, players are running out early and often. There's a nice moment right at the beginning of the game, when you have to observe the face-up Event cards and the discarded Great Work and decide how you're going to approach this game differently from your last one. Good stuff.

2. Almost every phase of the game provides opportunities for interesting, often counter-intuitive decisions that mask the fact that this game is indeed simply "auction after auction." The Event phase presents incentives for temporary alliances to emerge as you try to stave off disasters to Rome (and your Glory Point total) with the other players. During the Great Work phase, it might seem like you always want to vote for the Great Work and get the nice denieri-to-points conversion, but the potential shifts to Res Publica values and the famine tracker frequently create a big incentive to vote against it, even when you've got the most cash. I especially like the Crisis phase, which provides an opportunity for some clever tactical play, tanking the value of tokens you ordinarily would want to be more valuable so you can score a swing of 6 points on at least one opponent. Whenever I see this in action, I think "nice touch" regarding the game's design. I find the Building phase toughest to grok and thus the most interesting: the multi-suited, multi-use cards, combined with the once-around nature of the auction, make it tough to estimate how much you want to bid.

3. The theme might be pasted on, but it works well, adding to the flavor of the game. The temporary alliances and counter-intuitive tactics provide a feel of the politics of Ancient Rome, at least as popularized in our modern culture. One round your allied with the player to your right; the next with the player to your left. One round, you're voting with the Plebes, the next you're going all in on the Pantheon. It is evocative of the conniving backstabbing that comes with an ever-shifting political landscape, even though you're essentially "converting resources."

4. The game seems quite well-balanced, though the random variations mentioned in #1 might make some strategies more suitable for a particular session than others. Therein lies the best part of the game: making a strategic "call" at the beginning about how you think things will go and then adjusting along the way. Sometimes the dude with 18 Res Publica tokens comes from behind to win the game. Other times he stays in last. It really depends on how the variable parts of the game play out and who was able to take advantage of them the best.

While Sylla probably won't ever be my favorite game, it's proven itself to be more than "just another Euro," which it seemed to be at first. A laudable effort from Ystari Games.

[b]Update on 2-Player Game:[/b] If you love Sylla, you'll probably enjoy its 2-player variant. But it does eliminate the temporary emergent alliances that I think are a key my enjoyment of the game. With 3 or 4, I find Sylla to be pretty solid; with 2, it can be a little lackluster.

RATING: 7.9
There is planty of interaction in this game, with strategy taking a big part of which buildings you buy and even down to when you time your bids (as leaving it to the round before the last you can decide which of the remaining buildings get thrown away).
Very enjoyable and clearly aimed at "gamers" and not family play.
My only criticism is that it could have been shorter (maybe only 4 rounds per game) without losing any of the enjoyment. With all the rounds being identical it is very repetitive, and if you play all 5 rounds - the game does outstay its welcome on the table.

Bit of a dissapointment for me. Very euro in execution, but with more player constraint than I normally like. The game plods through its few rounds, dragging the payers behind itself, trying to do what little they can with what little they have. It's that sort of fun.

A neat blend of interesting mechanics in a single game. Most of the game consists of auctioning and voting, but it feels very unique and different. The game accommodates everything really well without feeling convoluted. My only complaints are that I wish this supported more amounts of players, and I also think that revolts and famine should be more punishing. The events, in general, feel like they could have been developed further to be more punishing to those who don't focus on them. This really should have gotten a little more In The Year of the Dragon-style treatment. Otherwise this is a pretty unique Euro with a fair amount of strategies to explore. It's not perfect, and it's not one I'm always going to want to play, but it's one of the few auction games I really enjoy.

Not a hard game, takes up a lot of room. Maybe should have been printed with smaller cards for the "worker" cards. Takes up a lot of room when it doesn't need to.

First play: seems nifty, but not hugely impressed. Has potential to grow on me, but I remain skeptical for now. (Very nice flavor art, but ugly functional art.)

Two more plays: Now have some semblance of a strategy, but I hold with those who find it a mishmash. It *is* tied together very nicely in theme and flavor, but that doesn't quite make up for the lack of elegance. Interesting decisions, but they don't gel (yet?) for me in a good way.

RATING: N/A
In this game, based on the Roman dictator, one starts the game with four people, with choices among senators, merchants, vestal virgins, slaves and soldiers, but no more than two of one type. The unchosen cards from all players go back into a general deck. Players then bid to see who is pro-consul (with senators adding a vote), and the pro-consul also gets a stock of their choice. Next up is acquiring more people, starting with the Pro-consul. Players then bid for goods, receive income, and bid for VPs. Finally, there is an event phase, where the vestal virgins and soldiers can influence to win stock tokens. 

There are a lot of things going on in this game. In my only game, I didn't bother feeding my people, and lost horribly. I would certainly like to play again, and I think each game would be fresh and different.

The artwork!
Scoring feels a little fiddly, with the 3 currencies tracked privately and scored separately at different rates, as well as main scoreboard.
Other than that (which might be as easily streamlined with a 4-track tote?) the game is a balance between building up and tearing down, which seems to work fairly well.  Everyone has a different approach to taking points by the end-game, and it's this dynamic flexibility that makes me want to play more of this curious game.

A painful game, but in the best of ways. Every decision will affect a later one in some way, so the game does tend to drag a little as no choice seems trivial.

Tableau-management with a little stock-holding twist. Sylla offers some genuinely varietal routes to victory and allows you to depress your own shares as well as boosting them. Perhaps a little dry and can be too long in the wrong hands.

RATING: 7
[i]The players take the role of ambitious Roman aristocrats, who vie with one another for prestige and glory. The prestige come in the form of Victory Points. The vying is managed with intricate mechanisms whereby money tokens and workers are converted into yet more tokens, or directly into points.[/i]

Does this sound rather familiar? Hmm.

To be fair, Sylla has some interesting ideas. Highlights for me are:

· Players bid for turn order, then draft their workers.
· Some workers are vulnerable to threatening events and may be lost through the game- but they can be redeemed for points.
· Throughout the game there are always four disasters about to affect the city: players can stop two of the four. Stopping disasters gains points- but allowing them to occur may hurt an opponent more than it hurts you.
· Players have frequent opportunities to collect tokens; representing Civil Spirit, Leisure and Health. These are worth varying amounts of points at the end of the game depending on a kind of "stockmarket". This payout table can be manipulated and is also affected by the disasters.

There's a lot to like about Sylla, and many clever ideas. But I felt it was just a little soulless. The regular disasters felt a little like In the Year of the Dragon, but that game seems tighter and more coherent. I will need to play Sylla more before I can give a final answer- the current rating is tentative at best.

A difficult game to get into as the rules are overlong and clumsy for what turns out to be a relatively simple Euro affair. Collect characters. Each character can be tapped each turn to either help buy a building or to do its special power later in the turn (which may be to bid/collect money or help avoid an event). Buildings are your standard ongoing benefits of collecting money, VP's, etc, or one-off hits. Characters not used to buy buildings can then be allocated against events - events which have the least characters allocated to them are going to hit town, always in a bad way. Lastly you get to spend money on VPs via a blind bid thing which changes in nature each turn. It seems like a decent number of moving parts, but once you get through a round, it becomes clear and you can concentrate on the main decisions each turn - what group of characters to concentrate on, and how to work those characters into a feasible approach to collect VPs faster than the other players, be it either mainly by straight money conversion or token collection (and consequent manipulation of each token colour's VP value for end of game), with both approaches rewarded by event manipulation. There's enough going on so that it doesn't feel explored after a game; a good thing. But it may not have enough variety to get past 5 or so plays. The 5 rounds it plays in is probably about right length wise, providing enough time to see your approach take shape. The decisions on what to tap and what not to tap aren't easy each turn, especially as you experience the ramifications of events that you don't want to happen (which you could have been prevented if you hadn't been greedy for buildings earlier) and this process provides the main interest. The overall impression is one of "interesting" without being "intriguing".

At its heart Sylla is an auction game set in Rome (though the theme doesn't have much to do with anything.) You are collecting buildings, helpers and tokens, which can be used to score victory points at the end of the game. It mixes a few different mechanics but felt a little flat to me. This is a game I'd probably play again if someone else wanted to, but I wouldn't put it on the table myself.

Second game as great as the first one.  The theme is awesome as well as  the components.  It is just a little long to explain to new players which makes me wonder if this game should be an 8.

Played a solo game using the 2 player rules.  Really I don't understand why this game does not get more love.  Theme is awesome and mechanics are very fun.

an ok first play, especially since I beat Alan the master of efficiancy. I would play it again but would have to be talked into it. There are just so many better games to play out there. Production quality is nice enough. In the long run I don't think this game has staying power. It's play is too scripted, options are limited. You need votes. You know you'll need to acquire tokens, so will everyone else. You will have similar money to everyone else. You will average one tile per round, just like everyone else. You will manipulate the token track, just like everyone else. Rinse and repeat. Too predictable in what you can do and thus in the end not much fun. The theme is nice and fits Roman politics somewhat. An interesting oversight by the designers pointed out by a friend: There are "christian" cards/people in the game but the rules state it takes place in 70 BC.

Mainly a mecanics game that may be lacking of soul. The material is superb and the rulebook is well made and effective. The rules are well explained and are easy. The initial set up of the game is a little bit long. The main problem of the game is that the mecanics of each step of the game are so well linked that you seem to be playing like robots.
I will have to try it more to officialized my rating.

Principalement un jeu de mécaniques et qui semble manquer d'âme. Le matériel est superbe et le livre de jeu est bien fait et efficace. Les règles sont bien expliquées et sont simples.

Quite an interesting games, with loads of fases but it plays quite smoothly indeed. the board could def. have been bigger since you need to lay out so many cards here and there, and in the end it becomes a big mess around this tiny board. that and the markers could have been bigger and nicer, they're bhutt ugly, which is a shame cause the cards are great. Love the different mechanisms of the game, with little surprises here and there and the hidden scoring. Recommended :)

Great, great gamers game.  It's hard to teach and it seems like it takes a few plays for it to flow well, but it's worth it.  Many interesting decisions.  The artwork on the cards and tiles are beautiful.  The board itself sucks, though.  The VP track is too small for the player tokens.  It's a small board and too crowded.  Also, the fact that there are christians in the game but in the rules introduction they say that the year is 79 BC is kind of strange.  Minor quibbles for an otherwise great game.

RATING: 9
I prefer to play with 3 or four but the game is good with two; I see no reason why they shouldn't have included the 2 player variant within the publication.  There is good tension through out a turn and almost every action also has a consequence, and that's true if you're playing with 2,3 or 4 players.  Fantastic game!

I particularly like how each phase of the game is like a mini mechanic/game but they are all tied together within a turn.  The more I play Sylla, the more I recognize what a solid game design it has.

The only thing I would change in the game is the picture (art in general) of the Great Work Ecclesia.  It would be much better if it was a bright colored and uplifting picture of christ or baptism as opposed to a dreary, mass of shadowy people looking upon a twisted, ugly face on a figure holding a small cross.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great artwork and theme. I really like how turns flow so smoothly without much downtime. The bidding mechanic is well implemented into the game as each character serves a special purpose.

There does seem to be a steep learning curve with Sylla. Hard to teach to new players and I still consult the rulebook after a few plays. I might also call the game a little fiddly as cards and tokens start to fill up the playing area.

Lots of moving pieces but they all fit together nicely. Excellent marriage of theme and system - you can see the competition for prestige and status in the Roman republic peeking out from the auctions, worker placement, events, and great works. Has a healthy dose of jostling conflict. It looks like diplomacy and informal deal-making will become to the fore once players become experienced, which again draws out the theme.

Quite repetitive, and very few strategic choices. For instance, why are there both vestalin and soldier? -- It restricts you in where you can put your cubes in the catatstrophee phase. This restriction is not good for strategy IMO. As others have pointed out: Senator and Trader are basically the same, since the Trader gives you 1 Denar, and the Senator gives you 1 vote (OK, twice per round, that is: in the election of the first consul and in the building phase) and 1 vote = 1 Denar. So what?

I also cannot see how I can be sure to adapt a strategy (that is: Can I select my favoured tiles, cards, etc.)

I also dislike the blind bidding phase on the buildings. it is pure luck, how 10/6/2 VPs are distributed.

But my highest critics is: There is simply no tension. Repetitive running through the phases.

The only thing I really love is the idea of holding your thumbs up or down. A great idea, which immediately brings Rome to the table. Great idea!!

RATING: 6
Another Ystari game where you're doing exactly the same thing - grabbing little points along the way through diverse mechanisms. Each mechanism we've seen before - here it's open auctions, blind auctions, tapping cards for actions and... well, that's it really. Unfortunately there's just nothing innovative here. It's an okay game, but it's looking like I only need one Ystari game in my collection because they're all essentially the same thing and they all rate somewhere around 6-7. It's a formula they've got and they're sticking to it. Mind you, this could be the one I decide to keep. The theme appeals. (Okay, I can overlook christians in the time of Sulla.) It's a (super) light Republic of Rome substitute.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players get cards usable for different auctions, and they have to pick where to use them and where not in order to score the most points. There are four bidding mechanics, together with a phase to collect cards and another for payouts.  It is a nice game, but it is hard to see a path in your first games.

A játék nem lenne rossz, esetleg még bele is férne a 7-es kategóriába csak van néhány problémám vele. Ystari grafikai világa továbbra sem emészthető számomra, szerintem csúnyák a játékaik és visszatetszést váltanak ki belőlem. Fölöslegesen túl vannak bonyolítva, réteg játékokat próbálnak készíteni. Ennek a két dolognak erősen ellentmond a Metropolys játékuk, de ugye tudjuk mindig vannak "fekete" bárányok. Sylla egy római korban játszódó játék, szenátorokat alakítunk és megpróbálunk az események között úgy lavírozni, hogy minél sikeresebben pozicionálhassuk magunkat ezáltal meg legyen elégedve velünk a pórnép. Az ötlet jó, látom is benne a fantáziát, de az említett okok ........

Érdekes mechanizmusok, nem túl vészes játékidő, több út a győzelemhez. Ismét egy jól összerakott Ystari játék. Megmondom őszintén nekem bejönnek ezek. A szabálymagyarázat a sok fázis miatt elhúzódhat, de egyáltalán nem nehéz, rögtön megérthető. Talán még elsőre játszva sem nehéz a játék. Az egykörös licitek jól eltaláltak, a nagy mű megépítésének mechanizmusa nagyon jól kitalált. Ténylegesen több út vezet a győzelemhez. Egyrészt a segítők jó megválasztása, illetve az épületek beszerzése különböző stratégiákkal kivitelezhető. A tábla lehetne ugyan egy kicsit szebb, de itt a játék a lényeg nem a kinézet.

I had all but given up on Ystari after their last few let downs.   

This, though, is quite satisfying.

Very cool engine game, where you are building up purchasing power.  Many things to take into account, with multiple strategies.  I'm a big fan of having choices in games and this really gives them to you.  

This has a very clever auction system as all cards that you use are multi-purpose, so there is always the debate of how you want to exhaust your men.  

I can't help but feel that this game is one turn too long, hence only a 7, but with more plays my opinion may change.

A lot going on in this one, and it takes a round or two to figure it out.  It also helps to note that the Res Publica tokens are much of your score.

RATING: 7
Typical Ystari game in that there are lots of different things going on, lots of options, all interwoven nicely. The board looks busy but is designed pretty well: easy to figure out what you're supposed to be doing next. Fun game.

--- Not a Summary ---
Every player starts with the same set of character cards from which they choose their starting lineup. The unchosen characters from all players are then shuffled together and come out 6/round; players will be recruiting 1 each round, in turn order. These characters may either be used to pay for buildings, or for their special power (if any). Determining start player (Consul) and buying buildings both are by once-around auctions, so although there is a lot of auctioning going on, the game still moves along nicely. There's also a blind bid -- players will be voting to either support whatever major work is being built (players bidding most and second-most votes get bonus VP, usually) or buy VP (guaranteed, but poor exchange rate of votes/money for VP) -- that's not nearly as painful as most blind bids, since you can opt for the sure VP choice if you want. In addition to all of this, you're also trying to collect Res Publica tokens by winning Consul, buying certain buildings, and helping prevent events (using special powers of Legionaires and Vestal Virgins). AND I haven't yet mentioned the ladder, or famine!

Many things going on at once, all tied together. Definitely worth another play!

Played with 3 players:
I haven't decided anything about this one. I'm not sure if I like it. At first it seemed to have a rythm problem with some of the mechanisms not very well combined but I have to test it again to see things more clearly.

Played a couple of times more. There's something not working very well. It promises something that never arises. It has a strange feeling.
I don't totaly dislike it.

This game has serious problems. It seems that things don't work as they should. Famine and revolts are good ideas but the mechanic itself doesn't work. I've never seen a revolt happening in one of my plays and I find the famine too much static for being considered something players should care about. famine level is almost every turn on the 6th space and if it drops it only happens once and gets right up again in a second for the rest of the game. This also means that the most important building in the game could be the 2 food per turn.

Another day, another Euro.  Some of what I have to say here might sound really close-minded, but I'm such a sucker for theme and tend to become quickly bored by games that are all about the "mechanics".  So with "Sylla' we have another well-designed, well-produced, Euro-style game that might be fairly enjoyable if it weren't for the fact that it gets lost in the sea of previously-released Euro-style games.  For me, there just isn't enough here to set it apart from its predecessors (other than a bare bum or two).  Again, I'm not saying it's a bad game.  It isn't.  It's another clever resource-management game that contains several interesting features besides the bare bums.  Mind you, I was initially quite uninspired with the game play until about 3/4 of the way through my first game when things finally started to "click", and then I began to appreciate the various intricacies involved.  It captured my interest enough by the end of the game that I would definitely play again if asked, but I definitely would not volunteer it as an option for game night.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 5
Typical Ystari point salad enlivened by some intriguing interactive twists. For example, up to four disasters befall Rome each round unless fought off; it isn't possible to stop more than two, so some of those negative effects will always occur, effectively chosen by those players with soldiers and vestal virgins. There's also a charming mechanism where any Res Publica token in the crisis zone loses points for the player with the fewest of that type (their lack of effort in that domain means they are blamed by the people for the crisis) while the player with the most gains points.

It's all just less than the sum of its parts, though. Part of the problem is that the decade since its release has seen so many games modelling this kind of political instability in much more interesting and thematic ways (Pax Porfiriana, An Infamous Traffic and and the COIN series to name a few). The theme doesn't come through in Sylla so it just feels like an unusually opaque/fragile abstract mess of mechanisms.

I suspect it will reward experience, but I'm not going to ever play it enough to find out.

RATING: 6
[Ystari 2008 edition] {Roman; blind-bidding, bidding, resources management; optimal 4p} Sylla is another Euro game - calculation is the main point.  It's another offer from Ystari.  I am not a fan of Ystari games as I found their games are usually too abstract and soulless except calculation.  Except Caylus, I don't own any other Ystari games.  I don't like this game, either.  There are other better Eurogames to play with.

I don't think there is anything really new in the mechanics.  The theme is tenuous and it feels quite dry to play with.  There are player interactions in many aspects - bidding, setting price of the influence counter, etc., which provides the fun.  Replayability should be good.  Sylla seems to be a true multifaceted game - liberating slaves, Christianity, influence counter, gathering money, etc.  Yet, it is not as taxing as Caylus.  The game flow is easy to follow but it takes some time to explain the clearly.

The illustration is ok for me.  The screen is just too thin to be useful; folding in the middle just can’t stand firm.  The counters are just too small; they should be of similar size as the coins.

Some might say it's an auction game, but auctions are only a part of a more subtle and intriguing mechanism. There's a lot to explore and the replayability is high due to Event cards and buildings that can influence the game differently each time. 
Excellent!

I've been a big fan of most of Ystari's games so far, but Sylla just didn't grab me. It's hard to articulate exactly what I don't like here. I usually dig complex games, so the fact that there's so much going on in Sylla isn't an issue. Perhaps in part I'm not a fan of games where little disasters continually set you back, even if you do have at least some control over which event will happen. Sylla also seems qa bit dry and mechanical to me, as subjective a feeling as that may be. Whatever the reasons, Sylla just didn't have either the challenge or fun levels that make a game successful in my book.

Played twice, with 3 players and 4-players. A bit fiddly and tough to grok at first. This might be too subtle for my group, but I enjoyed the two plays. Need to figure out a good strategy as it appears that going for vestal virgins and legions might be the way to go as there are more points associated with winning the disks.

Very good game. A nice balance between the different avenues to victory. It also seems that once you pick a path you want to pursue, it isn't etched in stone that you can't change your path & still pull out a win.

I enjoyed the art and that there were multiple ways to garner a win, but the game felt very static towards the middle and seemed to end too quickly without enough tough choices or variance.  The famine marker could have been removed, and it would have affected our game very little.  Merchants are very close to useless.  Clockwise turn-order was lame.

First Impression:

Rome in all it's glory, or in game terms, decadence. A very tough and highly interactive game.

Luck being almost absent is always a plus for me, and having a highly interactive game that doesn't allow player bashing is another great advantage. Add highly diverse strategic options, nearly perfect information (and that's greater than it sounds, as you always know what area your enemy is strong, but you can't possibly remember how strong exactly he is to start the boring calculations), great variety in both setup and gameplay... Did I mention that the theme is perfectly intergrated and that I love it? Or that the game plays fast, has hard decisions shower you and flows well? I'm itching to rate this a ten but it's against my rules for a new-for-me game.

What's wrong? Well... maybe some strategies are better than others. I don't think so, but I can't really know yet for sure. Also, I guess the game is better with 4p rather than 2p... I also can't know yet, I tried it with 3p and I loved it. OK, I'm whining for no reason, I can't find a flaw yet to be honest.

Sylla.. apparently a great game.

Do I need you find your momma and slap her for having birthed freaks of nature that have let a superb game like this slip under the radar without the fanfare it so justly deserves? Forget the stupid controversies and nit picking of time frames (which Cyril addressed perfectly) and play this game.

THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE.

It's a Ystari auction game with an everything but the kitchen sink approach to the incorporation of mechanics, what more could you possibly need to know? It fits the mold of all recent Ystari games, so if those are up your alley then Sylla will likely be too. It seems like the kind of game that you'll have a very good idea of whether you'll like long before you sit down to play, if you have much prior Ystari experience. As I've said before, Ystari releases since Caylus haven't been my cup of tea, so just as with Amyitis, Bombay, Yspahan, and Mykerinos to some extent, Sylla didn't grab me or hold my interest me. I'm sure there must be a target audience out there for this type of game that Ystari keeps publishing, and I'm sure I must not be a member of that audience.

The art is excellent in this game. The game mechanisms are simple to explain but hard to master. The first time you play the game, you want to play it again although uncertain of what to do better the next time. The second time you play the game, you have the feeling you know the game and you don't want to play it again. But if you play it a third time, then the game really shines! I hope this descriptions summarizes Sylla. A very strong game but only if you try it a couple of times.

RATING: 5.5
Sylla is a game that I've wanted to play for many months without being sure why exactly. It might've been the "sort of cooperative" aspect (like God's Playground or Republic of Rome) or the commodity speculation aspect.

The cooperative illusion is barely there in comparison to God's Playground, as Sylla blatantly rewards those supposedly not at fault when one of Rome's scores tanks. The same mechanism makes the commodity speculation schizophrenic as well: If you invest heavily in something, it will be worth more points to you if it does well, but if it tanks, the game will actually give you a bonus while nailing the other players. Furthermore you have limited ability to affect (especially: improve) a given score.

There are a number of auction mechanics in the game. The most interesting one involves bidding on building tiles. The tiles randomly appear under one of three colors, which correspond to colored dots on your personnel cards. You bid dots and pay by "tapping" a card. But then that card can't use any of its abilities later in the turn. This system keeps winning bids pretty low (a plus for me).

Buildings of a given type seem a little scarce and I was reminded of The Speicherstadt in that I think you can mess up quite abruptly. If you fail to win any of the farm fields (which are only available earlier in the game) you will get nailed by the famine penalties over and over. There's no way to "convert" anything else into food.

Bidding to be First Consul every turn seems like overkill. It mainly affects turn order; I think the biggest advantage is the ability to break ties when deciding which crisis events were "solved" by the players.

I dislike in the building auctions that a player picks something to auction off. (First Consul will pick twice, like it's a perk.) There are some occasions where you can do something clever there but it reminded me in a bad way of Princes of the Renaissance in that it's really hard to control what might happen in an auction you start.

I don't understand why you score points at the end of the game for having Christians and for freeing slaves. Is it just chrome? Neither Christians nor slaves seem like a big disadvantage to have. Slaves are wild when bidding on buildings (their compensation for having no special powers) and Christians are targeted by a single crisis event that only affects a single Christian in your hand.

For some reason money seemed to be more plentiful when I played than was probably intended/assumed. Senators for a couple of purposes have the ability to count as a single coin in an auction/vote. That seems pathetic to me. There are also late game buildings that give you five coins (immediate, not recurring). That didn't strike me as worth bidding much of anything on.

Not a great game to be sure. Starting at 6.5 but may drop it. (This is a game where the ease and painlessness of playing makes me feel lenient.) It just seems like at the heart of the gameplay is a commodity speculation system that doesn't really work.

6 fases en cada turno. Se apuesta consul con los denarios, que gana fiha, se marca nivel de hambruna, se elige personaje, se compra edificio subastando por el color, se recogen ingresos, se seleccionan eventos apostando en cada uno con los cubos, de los dos mas apostados el consul decide cual se elimina y cual se ignora. Se aplica hambruna. Los marcadores de republica multiplican por las fichas que tu tengas de cada marcador. Tipico euro. Entrenido pero algo abstracto. Rapido de jugar

Sylla was the name of a Roman Consul and dictator; the name of the game is a reference to his person. The designer tried to bring together "Res Publica Romana" and "Saint Petersburg," furthermore playable in one hour.
The players will try to become the premier Consul of Rome. Each of the five years (turns) is subdivided into seven phases in which the players take their actions. It will be semi-cooperative as one player alone cannot influence all parts of the Roman social or political life. They also have to prepare for negative events like epidemic plague or persecution of the Christians and also decadence.

A bunch of interlocking mechanisms can make for a good game, but they do not constitute a good game in themselves. Here they just made the game a grind - it all worked OK, but was no fun whatsoever, and had precious little theme. (Tribune has more, despite the Roman theme being added late in the design process. Not to mention it's a much better game.)

This game takes several plays to show its quality. In the auctions for characters and buildings you decide your strategy in dealing with 1) the great works and events and 2) the way you wish to manipulate the value of your res-publica tokens (they're a bit like stock in a stock market). 

Alliance formation is a key feature of Sylla (during event resolution). There is more than one path to victory (e.g. one does not need to win with Res-Publica tokens).

The 2-player game works well despite alliance formation not playing a role. The expansion works well too.

Still trying to understand fully the game. I just love the amount of decisions packed in such a short timeframe. Negociation, backstabbing, clever auctions, screwage that looks like a cooperative subgame (this is genious). Hard to see how much of the game is controllable, but this is not a negative for me. Many paths are looking open for the win, and it is mandatory to understand what others are doing. I strongly suspect it is a better game with players that know the game already.

EDIT: Still struggling in understanding how the game fully works. But it is really nice and fun, with excruciating decisions... Keeping it to 9, waiting for more plays to see if there is more control or less. The negociation part of it is unclear to me, maybe I am not really playing with the correct folks though :-)

This is a great mesh of auctions that gives a great feeling of political jockeying (see my [thread=521905]review[/thread]). I really enjoy that tokens can be worth a variable number of points (controlled by the players) and that you are working to minimize the damage done to yourself by the events by forming temporary allegiances. Unique and satisfying.

VERY tentative rating after just one incomplete game: typical Ystari in that there's a bunch of mechanisms but little cohesion, and some of it just seemed thrown in there to fill the game out (like the grain phase). Found the dual use of the characters as resources potentially interesting but not sure if there is anything beyond that of substance that could draw me to the game in the long term. This will probably get another couple plays just from curiosity, not unlike Amyitis.

Simply great! A lot of things to consider during the course of the game. The role of senators, the slaves, the soldiers and the women, as well as the decisions of where to bid and where not to, are just some of the tough decisions you have to make during the game. And of course beware of the events and their consequences! For such a cheap game, i thing it offers a lot more than what I paid for!

As one of my gaming friends said - this game feels like "you are just spinning your wheels."  Sylla feels like you are doing all sorts of things, but not really accomplishing much of anything.

Lots of mechanics in this one. Senators, Vestal Virgins, Legionaires, Merchants, and Slaves (cards) are collected and then used to purchase buildings, stop events, and build great works but only one thing a turn. You also collect favor with the people in 3 areas that eventually help with victory points. There is also a  benefit after the last turn for having Christians and releasing slaves. It is tough to maximize your cards each and every turn.

If you like auctions then Sylla is probably the game for you.  There's a once around bidding for the first consul (for turn order); bidding for building tiles; and even a blind one for the construction of the great work.  Since money also count as votes in addition to the appropriate unused character cards, it becomes apparent that if you do not have a healthy source of income, you will often lose out on the benefits of these auctions.  So in our three player game the same person is always losing out on VP while the others get further and further ahead.  There is little to no catch-up mechanics built in to alleviate someone that has fallen behind.

Dull, repetitive and uninspiring.  Sylla is lacking in pretty every way to make me want to try it again.

Vastly underrated.  Has a stock component with a very innovative mechanic which allows you to gain points off of a resource even if its value goes down.  It's even themey.

Has a surprisingly poor rulebook.  There's something like four places you have to look in order to answer a question.

Another annoying 7 Wonders-Baths issue...they had to dress up a tiny dancer on the box cover for the prudish American market.  Very irritating.

Update Aug 2014: Boosting my rating from 8 to 9.  I love the way the satisfaction of the plebians is group-driven; I don't want to put many votes into it because my opponent has more resources and yet I'm motivated to bid high to boost the health position on the ladder.  Interesting choices.

Very easy to learn, with great mechanisms that make the players face difficult decisions about how they want to apply their employees.  As with Master Builder, events can cause workers to be useless; unlike Master Builder, you know in advance what those events can be, and can work against them.

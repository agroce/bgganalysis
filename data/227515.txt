Riverboat is a game about farming on the bank of the Mississippi and I thought it felt like Kiesling game. There is tile-laying, long-term planning and player-initiated scoring. This game works with role selection, like Puerto Rico, and the player selecting the role gets a benefit for that role. The roles play in order from (1) placing workers in your field to (2) adding crop tiles where your workers are place to (3) harvesting crops and adding riverboats to the dock to (4) adding a scoring card ("favorable opportunity") to (5) appraising (that is scoring) something or two.

The planning is very important and the in-game scoring that you initiate is also critical. Scoring in early rounds (like other Kiesling games... see Heaven & Ale) can feel like a waste, but actually be pretty important. It's easy to lose site of the fact that you can score those extra points only 2 times per turn (3 during the last turn). But, you need appraisers in your supply and you need places to score. I'd like to play this again to see if it holds up, but my first play tells me it was Kiesling's best design at the con. I actually feel like Heaven & Ale was talked about more because of its theme of brewing beer, but Riverboat may be the better game.

First few plays are fun, but after 3-4 plays it becomes a bit the same. I like the role selection mechanic but most of the time the choices are pretty obvious. Scores seems to be very close almost every time, which makes you wonder: does it even matter what I choose? Traded away.

So happy to have obtained this gem from my neighbor country (Canada). A special shout out to  Mark Johnson BGG: (Eeeville) Thanks Mark. Kiesling has some gems to his name (mostly with Kramer), but for me, this is his best to date and my initial rating may go up. Its a true testament to a designer when he can create a solid experience at all player counts and not have to modify the game structure (board/dummy player/card count etc.) itself. This game is a bit puzzley-abstract at the opening phase (Cultivation/Planting) but then settles into more of a  worker placement/ worker management game with the iteration of rounds never feeling the same. I like the card play, the estate bonus's and the feeling of watching your opponents but not obsessing about what they are doing. the engine building is smooth, the gameplay tight and the asthetic is a thing of beauty. There is a lot of tension from round to round because of the scoring structure: (Do I send workers to New Orleans now or wait? Do I grab an opportunity card for a surveyer bonus or get the card I need? When or how should I spent my coins? Can I afford to not get the Harbor Master out in front for maximum Riverboat points and thus settle for second?)  Do I go Barn Now or Well long tern? The Could I, Should I, Will I  is so powerful in this game its absolutely gripping. Ultimately, I'm not sure why the game is called Riverboat as the 'Riverboat' itself is a byproduct of what you cultivate/plant but none the less this game is truly excellent. I've read some of the comments here like, too much of an advantage for paying a coin to search the deck. I do not believe this to be true because you also lose the coin and do not get the critical bonus, also read something about luck. There is really no luck here maybe more tactical than strategical but that is mitigated throughout with a consistent stye of gameplay.I imagine playing it a lot since it is incredibly accessible, has a very high replay value and plays with 3 in just over an hour. Very well done. Thanks for yet another gem Mr. Kiesling worth the extra $$ I spent to obtain it.

Love the draft for 1st player in each phase with bonus. Liked being in this world and all the mechanisms used. In the end I didn't feel anything new from game to game. What I planted didn't matter too much, where I planted didn't matter too much. I liked how the pressure to get farmers back in your hand from round to round to continue to claim space contrasted with the desire to leave them in place to allow for larger scoring of dock tiles later.

Enjoyable game but I can see it getting same-y after a few plays. 

The tension of when to score your cards is a great mechanic, you can only score 2 per turn (3 on the last) so you want to maximize your scoring meeples each turn. Then again many of the cards reward you the more you plant/build, so it's a nice balance.

This is my kind of game! Lots of smooth mechanisms that interconnect in interesting ways.

I like the puzzle in the first two phases, where you put out workers and crops. I like how coins are powerful but rare. I like how you have to balance between scoring now for less points, or later for more points with a risk of missing out on other scoring possibilities. I like the harbor master and New Orleans races.

The only negatives are the set-up time, that it is a bit fiddly to move the small score markers, and a fear that the game might feel samey after a couple of plays. Time will tell if the latter is true or not.

I like worker placement, resource management & tile games , so this game has a headstart for liking it.  Each game is going to play differently because cards & tiles come out in different order & player boards vary as well.  
     I like the way the game plays.  but I also like attractive games & this one has less shelf appeal than many.  I also think the colors of the 4 different fallow fields could have been less similar--the game tried to compensate by putting teenie tiny symbols to help distinguish the areas, but they take some squinting to see.

RATING: 5
Riverboat, huh? Have all the farming-related names already bean taken? Anyway, Riverboat is about planting and harvesting and... doing stuff that earns you points. Or something. Mapping the player actions onto the setting is possible but non-obvious in most cases.
The game revolves around taking stuff (plants, boats, VP cards) in varying player order and puzzling it together on your private board in a way that hopefully gives you more points than the other players. As might be guessed from that (admittedly quite condensed) description the game is not very interactive. While grabbing stuff that other players would like to get their hands on certainly happens fairly frequently this is typically incidental rather than deliberate. The focus of the game is clearly on the puzzle aspect (stressed by some actions that, for a little sum, allow you to search the supply for the exact tile or card you want).
As such it probably does what it wants to do but I have some reservations about scoring (large VP differentials for possibly minimal differences in player position) and scaling (at 4 players the last round can be huge or depressing simply because of turn order when the various supplies run out).

RATING: 7
Der amerikanische Holocaust heisst Indianer und Sklaven. Der Grund, warum das Thema Indianermord, Sklavenhaltung und Exploitation in einem German Game unter allen Umständen zu vermeiden ist und man sich als Verlag im Vorfeld oder dem Regelwerk x-mal entschuldigen muss, muss am speziellen kollektiven Schuldbewusstsein der Deutschen liegen. Auch RIVERBOAT erklärt sich brav darin. Nur so lässt sich auch nachvollziehen, warum Baumwolle in einem Südstaatenthemaspiel rund um New Orleans und den Mississippi als zu verhandelndes und verschiffendes Warengut partout nicht vorkommt. Stattdessen bleibt es bei harmlosen wie politisch korrekten Radieschen und Kartoffeln. RIVERBOAT ist ein im Kern abstraktes Anbau- und Erntespiel von Herrn Kiesling, das dieser sich selbst treu bleibend regelknapp und euronackt gehalten und seine Kunst aus HEAVEN & ALE wiederholt hat. Oder umgekehrt. Mag man das eine nicht, mag man auch das andere nicht. Ich mag beide. Auch RIVERBOAT dreht das Dampferrad nicht neu, bleibt aber in seinen mechanistischen Optimierhebeln und seinen Mechanikzitaten (z.B. Charakterkarten PUERTO RICO, Rosenbergwaren etc) gelungen zeitgemäss: schlank, komprimiert, schnell gespielt. Weiße Sklaven setzen --> Klemens-Franz-Gemüseplättchen anbauen --> Zeug verschiffen --> Spielvorteil erhalten --> Punkte in Wertungsphase --> Schlußwertung. RIVERBOAT und HEAVEN & ALE wirken auf mich wie zwei siamesische Euro-Twins, die Eurovater Kiesling bei der Geburt eines neuen Eurobabys getrennt und in zwei unterschiedliche Entwicklungszimmer gesteckt hat. Die Genverwandschaft verbindet beide miteinander. Brother RIVERBOAT passt gut in das konsequente Portfolio von Lookout und ist nach dem Wien-Pop-Glanzstück GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL mal wieder eine brauchbare Kiste, auch wenn das US-Ausbeutungssymbol Baumwolle deleted wurde. Auch wenn die Welt von Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain, Dixie Band, Mardi Gras, Südstaatenvodoo, Sumpfgebiet und die schwüle Hitze aus True Detective bei RIVERBOAT atmosphärisch komplett auf der Flußstrecke bleiben wie in HEAVEN & ALE gleichermaßen der Geschmack eines frisch gezapften Fassbier fehlt, so ist RIVERBOAT doch ein stimmiges, gutes Spiel mit gutem Artwork, guten Farben und gutem Material für Spieler, die solche geschlechtsneutralen, ordnungsgemäßen Phasen-Abwicklungs-Eurogames mögen wie der hiesige Kommentatorschreiberling seinen senfgelben Baumwollpullover.

It thought it's more about ships, but it's almost only about laying the tiles in a good way. And this part is quite luck prone. Iconography not always clear what has to be harvested or not. And I don't like the fact that e.g. in a 3 player game someone gets one less phase tile in the sum. For that he should get a kind of bonus.

Kiesling + Lookout sounds pretty good to me and this game is a good one, but as most other games nowadays, nothing great. It works, has a few interesting choices to take, but it's very low on interaction and there's nothing we havn't seen a thousand times before.

On the other hand, this is far from the rules monster I thought it to be. In fact it's kinda easy. That however doesn't push it to the top and so it's just another solid game within a pool of other solid games.

A little too tactical for my taste... . The choices in the game seem pretty obvious, and the mechanic of searching through a pile, taking what you want, I find really annoying! Slows the game down, for little gain...

Also a tad bit too luck based, but OK for it's length...

Riverboat didn't excite me on my first play at PAX Unplugged.  It felt dry and uninteresting and solitaire-ish  We choose a bunch of shapes and place them where card draws stipulate and yaaawwn. try to earn more points than the other players.  So what?  I want something novel or that makes me feel excited in some way.  Excitement is not to be found here.  Next!

RATING: 8
Riverboat, a Kiesling design from Lookout/Mayfair games, was the best game of Sasquatch for me. It's a 1.5 hour long Euro packed with excellent decisions and a satisfying amount of tension.

The game is played over a fixed number of rounds, and each round there are 5 phases that happen in a set order. A round starts with players (in turn order) choosing one of these phases. By choosing a phase you gain a small bonus at the start of that phase, and during that phase turn order will start with you. Turn order advantage is a big deal in many of the phases. Weighing the various options in this decision is challenging and depends on many factors, including which phases others have already selected (i.e. where in turn order you are going to fall in the phases you don't select). This is reminiscent of the phase selection in Puerto Rico, however, here all 5 phases will happen each round.

The other stand-out mechanism, and the one that created the most tension during my play, was the balancing of scoring opportunities. Each round you have the chance to do 2 special scorings. To take advantage of these scorings you need to have acquired scoring tokens, which are in short supply. You are constantly confronted with the dilemma of when to spend these special tokens and how you are going to acquire more of them. There are a lot of things vying for your attention, so you are inclined to ignore these scorings early, but there are only so many of them so you have to be careful not to squander your chances to score. 

The game also features a supply of meeples that you must carefully manage, a hexomino tile laying element which I found particularly delightful, and a fierce battle to both acquire and score riverboat tiles. It might sound like there's a lot going on in the game, and I guess there is, but it all fits together seamlessly. The rules are not overly long or complex and the result is an excellent game that I eagerly await more plays of.

The only negative I can think of is that there is a random element in the drawing of cards each round. On the whole the luck of this balances out throughout the game, and there are ways to mitigate it. However, if you are extremely luck-adverse this element could spoil the game for you. I didn't find it to be a problem at all, I actually liked the kind of flexibility in planning it required.

This surprised me. It looks like a tile laying game but it's much more than that. First players draft an action tile in player order. Here's a bit of Puerto Rico was borrowed because when those actions are played (here, they're played in a specific order), everybody will take the same action and the person owning the action will get a small bonus. One of the actions is to place workers. Those get placed on your empty fields and determine where crops can be placed during a subsequent drafting round. Later you can harvest crops and gain a riverboat tile that are better depending on how large, contiguously, your crop was. There's also a few other scoring mechanics such as moving your dock man along the river for end-game scoring. It's a lot of familiar ideas put together in a way I found enjoyable.

While you're still competing for majority bonuses on multiple fronts, this feels less like a Kiesling game than a Feld game at times, since it has so many mashed together mechanics. Still, the mix is enjoyable enough, with the round tiles cleanly laying out the flow of the game. Something this convoluted shouldn't feel so effortless.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]After taking a couple of games to get all the rules right I'm really enjoying Riverboat. Each round you select a role which determines which phase(s) you'll be first player and get the associated bonus. The five phases are: placing workers in the field, draft crop tiles, harvest goods to take riverboats, obtain scoring objective cards and potentially score objectives. During each of the five phases there are ways to mitigate luck/player order because you can always spend a coin to get exactly what you need, but coins are scarce so you need to spend wisely. During your first play everything seems to be a bit disjointed, but as the game progresses you start to see how all the different actions tie together as you begin to formulate a strategy.

The main source of tension, and my favorite part of the game, is the scoring system. You cannot simply score objectives whenever you want, instead at the end of each of the four rounds you can score up to two objectives [i](three in the last round)[/i]. The longer you wait to score something the more points you will get, but at the same time you may not end up scoring everything you want if you wait too long. You also need to manage your supply of surveyors, the meeples needed to score objective cards and/or plantation features, because you only start the game with two. Everything in the game is well balanced and requires thoughtful planning. At first blush Riverboat appears to be a point salad game, but in reality you really need to focus on what your strategy is going to be and then execute it. You can't dabble in everything and end up doing well, there is just too much going on. As I mentioned earlier there is very little randomness in the game because you can spend coins to get plantation tiles, riverboats and the objective cards you need making it possible to plan and execute a specific strategy based around certain scoring features.

As of now I'm still undecided on whether Riverboat will have the legs to stick around in my collection because there are only so many paths you can go down. Yet the more I play the more I'm enjoying Riverboat and so far there is enough diversity in the strategies you can explore to keep me engaged. We'll see how things shake out a year from now, but for now I'm happy to have this in our collection.[/i]

Personally, my favourite of Kiesling's releases in 2017 (all of which were very good). A wonderful blend of mechanisms, from action selection through tile laying to card drafting, which come together to produce a very satisfying and meaty gaming experience which nonetheless plays out relatively quickly. As so often with Kiesling's designs, smooth gameplay and a fairly straightforward rule set mask a game of considerable variety, depth and subtlety.

Pretty abstract. You have to set collect and place tiles on your fields in hopes of harvesting them. Not really into the role selection mechanism. I don't know if it actually makes that much difference in the game play. Could do without that mechanic. It is a fine game.

Reminds me of Voyages of Marco Polo - not at all in terms of mechanisms but in a medium weight euro game which doesn't present anything truly revolutionary but ends up as an excellent game that is greater than the sum of its parts (with really great decisions).

This felt like multiplayer solitaire to me. Not much interaction and it seemed that the best plays were fairly obvious once you got through the first or second round. Not a particularly compelling experience for me.

Really like this one after 2 plays. Noth8ng stunning, but it does feel just a little bit different. It all hangs together well, the 2 player game is not as competitive as the 4 player - I like the surveyor dynamic in terms of having to decide what to score and when.

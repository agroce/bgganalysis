Draft an army of 24 cards from a selection of 48.  Then contest five bits of land in the style of Schotten Totten/Battleline.  There's some variety of terrain and significant differentiation between unit types.  Field of Glory plays quickly enough and has some flavour of ancient battles.  However, the whole package felt a little stale to me.  It might have helped if the opposing sides had represented contrasting historical armies rather than identical, generic forces.

Peter Dennis' artwork gives the game a charming feel of the military history books of my childhood.  Production quality is good.

Some interesting new ideas on the battleline game. The selection process of your own deck in the beginning gives this game more lifetime. Otherwise this would have been a one timer.

Don't really know what to think about this little game. I played twice in Essen, but the first one was full of misplays due to a mix of half explanation by a demo guy and half rules read by a friend.

There's a drafting system reminiscent of Campaign Manager 2008. There's a gameplay reminiscent of Battle Line (you must conquer 3 out of 5 columns). There are lots of different units. So the game seems different enough to be interesting.
But the gameplay felt a bit bland, and quite luck driven. 

Probably there is more behind the first appearance, but I failed to see it.

Would gladly play again (a friend bought it), but now I don't feel the need to own it.

Initial Impression: This game surprised me on a number of levels. For one, it's a Martin Wallace game that has very little buzz so I wasn't expecting much going into the game. The second surprise was just how much I enjoyed it. For a card game, there's alot more theme than I was expecting. The initial drafting of armies is interesting and really doesn't take too much time. The quick decisions lead to army tweaking and specialization. The gameplay involves many tough decisions; who, where, and when to deploy units. The best part is that everything clicks thematically. After just a few plays I can see that this game offers a host of subtleties typical of many full-fledged multi-hour boardgames. This little card game is staying in my collection for a long time.

Read the rules.  Reminscent of Omen: Reign of War.  Players build their own decks (a la Campaign Manager).  Players play through their deck and get to shuffle twice.  When both players have exhausted their deck the second time, the game is over.  On a player's turn, he can put cards in as many columns as he wants (and can afford) but no more than 2 deep.  He can also attack (each player can add a card for its Command Points) and he gets some points for flank attacks.  If he is greater, the terrain card rotates towards him, but it can rotate back next turn if the other player wins the next attack.  Looks like it may be fun and I'd enjoy playing it, but probably won't buy it unless it's under $20.

This is a very clever game and one that is much deeper than a first reading of the rules indicates. As we played several games in quick succession the layers of strategy emerged, much to our enjoyment. It easily joins Battleline and Roma in my choice of top two-player games. I see several comparisons to Battleline in the comments section but it plays very differently, having more cosmetic features in common than actual gameplay.

solid enough battle card game for 20 mins. Definitely a child of battle line but with sufficient differences to be its own game. Draft half the available deck into an army, draw cards, play them to fight over terrain cards. There are some subtleties in hand management, risk reward, push your luck, and unit matching. You can also draft for certain strategies. I would expect the meta between two players to evolve a bit over time, if you play it that much.

Current favorite two-player card game. 

I wish it used chariots or something a little more common than elephants. 

The drafting leads to each player having a unique army that feels a certain way. Really fun to see how you have to nuance a cavalry army differently then one that focuses on heavy infantry, or that uses elephants, or that uses skirmishers and spearmen, and so on. 

So many games have combat involve a lot of luck, or take forever to resolves. This game elegantly takes into account terrain, unit match-ups, and command and just takes a few moments. 

Purchased in 2014.

Surprised about the game. Light, yes, yet there seem to be pretty tough decisions to be made. I also could feel the ebb and flow of an ancient battle as it was being fought, tense, till the tipping point. 

UPDATE
Played again. Neat bluffing game with many elements to it. It depicts well the feeling of the miniatures game. I wonder if using heavier infantry is wise. For now I can see that lighter infantry and cavalry are the best choices, while, I guess, medium and heavy infantry should dominate the battlefield. Maybe this will happen in an "all plains" battlefield. Future plays will tell. 

UPDATE
There are a lot of nuances that I hadn't seen first. All in all this is a very neat little game!

UPDATE
Given to a friend, I will acquire a new one if I see one. :)

Good little card game. I enjoyed this problem was after several plays I just moved on without really feeling the need to go back to it.

Yes I know that the games are different but I still felt like I was playing Magic.

Nice, easy tactical game. Strong theme, mechanics support theme very well. Strong emphasis on flanking. plays fast, only few rules which also make sense. Rules description could be a bit more clear. Questions about rules are answered on BGG. Replayebility looks good. This might be a very good game indeed. So far it is the only light weight tactical game (that I know) which I would call a wargame.

Arrived 25th April 2014.

Love this little card wargame. There is actually a lot of depth to the game play in this title and a fair bit of planning and execution that needs to be watched to get the most out of the fight. Lots of calculation of position and availability of card resource to worry about and knowing what to commit, when and where is critical. Tight little game well worth playing.

I love battle line but Field of glory feels more like war. Not only because of nice art work but rhytm of (fake) attacks and retreats captures the tide of battle. Casulties are permaments so wise commander tends to attack only when sure about victory.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2017)

Martin Wallace is one of my favorite game designers, so I always try to buy his stuff, however, I have found I like much more his heavier games than his lighter games. Field of Glory: The Card Game has some decisions in it, but it a light-medium game.

Field of Glory: The Card Game´s rules aren’t very complex, I had to read the rulebook twice about the flanking rules, but once I understood them, I explained the game under 4 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes.   

I don’t know the parent game and I’m not into wargames in general, so the theme is lost to me. However, it seems it is (mostly) pasted on.

The artwork is very reminiscent of A Few Acres of Snow, it has the same style. I don’t like it very much but it is ok and it serves well its purpose.

Field of Glory: The Card Game´s decisions aren’t very complex. What I liked the most was the beginning of the game in which each player draws cards from his deck and chooses which cards will appear in the game, that´s neat and the decisions aren’t obvious. Then, the gameplay becomes much more straightforward, the decisions still aren’t obvious, but they aren’t very complex either. There are units with special abilities and there are terrain cards than change the combat stats.

Gameplay is (a bit) reminiscent of Schotten-Totten, but this game has harder decisions and is much deeper, I’m not sure this is a plus in this case.

Luck of the draw plays an important part in the game, but I’m still undecided if it bothers me or not.

Bottom line, Field of Glory: The Card Game can be a good game for some people, but it is not for me. I love two player games, but at the end of the day, I prefer to play fun games with more meat (Dungeon Twister) or fun games that are very light (Schotten-Totten) and, Field of Glory: The Card Game, sits in the middle of the spectrum, and due to this I have no desire to play it again. I will sell it ASAP.

Wallace does [gameid=372]. As can be expected it's a more complicated affair with more theme and more gratuitous chrome. I don't know and will never play the miniature game that inspired this game. Concerning ancient warfare with the mix of unit types and interactions, it reminds me a bit of [gameid=14105]. FoG: Card Game is stuck somewhere between these two games. Not sure if I need the middle ground but for now I'll give it a few more tries.

After one play I found it to be an okay game, but it didn't really grab me.

RATING: 5
A Battleline-esque game in that cards are played to fields of battle but the comparison ends about there. 

FoG begins with both players drafting their army from two identical decks. TO mix the draft up the players draw 4 cards per draft and are allowed to keep 2. In this way a player may only be offered certain units with each draft. 

Once the draft is complete they will have access to a 24 card army. 

The 2nd half of the game then requires the payment and placement of units to 1 of the 5 fields and unit strength and special powers come into play. 

The game incorporates wargame elements such as flanking at times and units are able to withdraw from a battle rather than fight to the death, but at a cost. 

All in all this game has all the hallmarks of a good game but it doesn't live up to that potential. I prefer similar styled games such as Revolver, Battleline or BloodBowl: Team Manager.

Martin Wallace takes the Empires of the Ancient World combat system and turns it into a pure card game. Good light hand management stuff. It's certainly entertaining for under 30 minutes of card game, but it's no Manoeuvre. (On the other hand it's less than a half hour time investment from opening the box to putting it away - this is a major attraction for me.)

My only significant issue, and not one that affects my ranking, is that a wordy flanking rule is an unnecessary complication for such a simple little game. The Overlap cards simulate this well enough that it probably would have been better to leave flanking out instead of complicating matters. (When playing my first couple of games I ignored the flanking rules and it barely seems worth the extra complication now I've been playing with them - a couple more Overlap cards in the deck would have done the trick just as well.) Aside from that it's simple as anything once you absorb the different combat outcomes and exceptions (eg. Defender doesn't get their written combat modifier... unless it's the Spear winning on ties if defending.) A better layout of the rules would have helped with this and in lieu of a reference card then a reference quarter panel on the back of the rules to keep handy.

There's some decent choices with the initial unit selection and then unit selection throughout the game as the two sides hammer it out looking for advantages and strategic withdrawals. At the end of the day blind combat draws might make the difference, or better risk vs reward evaluation or pure patience. My first play or so and I wasn't too impressed, but further play and I've warmed to the game considerably. The journey is a quick and fun one. Simple, short and another keeper from Mr Wallace.

The game end when the active player controls three Terrain cards (and they then win), or after the second shuffle card is discarded the player who controls the most Terrain cards wins.

Some people are commenting that they don't like the withdrawals, but I enjoy this option being available - even if I rarely employ it. Withdrawing becomes far less attractive because you’re temporarily relinquishing a stake on the terrain. If your opponent is constantly withdrawing then you'll quickly gain an advantage with cards in hand and your opponent simply won't be able to keep up with countering your deployments. Control over the most terrain wins. Most games I play come down to a close 2-1 or 1-0 control over terrain cards. Only when tied do we compare victory points.

Some people also comment that they don't like the unit restrictions, but I find it adds an interesting element to the initial unit selection and when you should play a second unit to a terrain card in the first place. I rarely add a second unit to a terrain card. Usually only in defence. A Spear and an Archer works well. Of course the opponent can mess with this defensive formation by attacking firstly with a cheap unit (such as a light cavalry), with no VP value and sacrificing that unit to kill off my archers. Then after weakening my defensive formation they hit me with a strong unit. In this way they sometimes get around the unit type restrictions. After that it call comes down to having managed your cards and saved Commanders for the tight battles. A certain amount of bluffing when drawing from the hand is also a factor.

This is a fast playing and wickedly clever design.  The army building mechanism at the beginning means that you in practice can have distinctly different armies coming to the battle.  Play accurately captures the frustrations heavy infantry had coming to grips with light infantry.  Also plays very well solitaire, if you are willing to always draw the bonus card from the deck rather than playing from your hand.  A surprising gem.

RATING: 8
battle card game, somewhere between Battleline and Battle for Stalingrad, more towards the latter in complexity.

From reading the rules it looks good, and generally I like this type of games- fast and simple to explain but they include significant brainburning and tension. Small box, requires little table space and generally looks like a good choice.

UPDATE> Very simple to explain, very fast in play- one needs to get used of the rhythm as the battle ends quickly and all the great plans one made go to the garbage. 

 Looks like there are many tactics and deck building approaches to discover. 

 It kind of bugs me that once the units are deployed in a position they remain there without being able to move elsewhere-they can perform flank attacks though, which is definitely something. 

 I need at least 4-5 more games to evaluate this.

UPDATE> The more I play it the more tense it gets, and the more tactics, subtleties and intricacies me and my friends discover. A very nice choice for a card filler.

Surprising good little cardgame. 

Really like the drafting mechanism (you go through your whole deck at the start and draft 2 out of each 4 cards) to build your own army. Gameplay is solid, flanks are tough and it has just enough units to have a solid varied flow of the game.

Can go for a while though and is AP prone. But it is a nice, clean, small good solid Martin Wallace design.

If you like Battlelines or Schotten Totten this is one to look out for.

Quite a surprise that this game is not as known as Battle Line. Basically it is very similar to Battle Line but offers much mroe in smaller box. The drafting mechanism enables players to use favourite tactics against one another and the flow of battle is more reminiscent of the real combat than just a game of numbers. The system is simple to udnerstand with it's own rock-paper-scissors mechanics and special actions and bluffing is just another piece improving the game.

::First-Play Report::
My first play was a bit rough. We played through a whole game missing one important rule. In the end, both of us criticized the game for the same thing, that same thing happened to be an affect from the missed rule.

So needless to say, we need to give it another go to have a fair say as to how good it is. But I see solid potential with the rule set right. I will report again once I play it correctly.

Fun light war card game with a good bit of depth (for a light card game).

Field of Glory: The Card Game is a nice and compact tactical wargame set in Ancient times. Sort of a beefed up [thing=760][/thing]. It's quick to play, got easy rules and has enough depth to make it interesting.

I game that looks like Battle Line, but has more going on.  But, I'm not sure that I enjoy what is going on enough to pull this one out very often.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly subtle and complex strategy game here, with a fair dusting of theme keeping it connected to its war game roots.  I like it--although I'm terrible at it, and the lack of certain key rule clarifications in the rulebook is shameful.

Provisional score after one aborted play (games group arrived and Cosmic Encounter hit the table). Like the look of it so far.

I don't see much replay-ability. What a shame.

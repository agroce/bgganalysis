A vast improvement on the first edition. But, i still cant't appreciate it like i should. I don't really know why. 

Scenarios are solofriendly. The campaign game depends on hidden units. 

Have to play more to really rate it.

Beautifully produced, and an excellent revision of the original (also owned).  I'd love to see the system applied to other campaigns of the war.

Clarification by designer as of 2/4/18 = remove "defender" in 8.5.6. 

Great tutorial sequence. I finished the first two (6a and 6b). Didn't even need to learn any movement rules other than stacking. Pretty much just bombardments, coordination, maneuver combat, and assault combat. 

[later] finished scenario 3. Adds in Hot LZ and a tiny bit of movement. 

[much later] got off minecraft and played scenario 5. Adds nothing new. 

[much much later] played scenario 4. PAVN 15 to FWA 12. With a different roll at the buzzer, the FWA would have taken LZ X-RAY for a 14-10 win. Needed to roll a 5 or less. Rolled a 10. Oops. 

Excellent production level all around. Barely any errata. 

As far as whether or not I like the game? NO IDEA YET. I think this will be set up for a LONG time.

Thoroughly enjoying playing through the training scenarios solo here.  Hope to ensnare a friend into learning the system so I can play a campaign game as the sneaky PAVN. Until then I shall continue to learn the system.  Excellent components, map almost sits flat.

Initial impressions after playing a few of the intro scenarios solitaire. Beautiful components, lots of scenarios, and a color rulebook that is mostly good, though I have a few quibbles.

The mechanics? Not sure yet. While a bit heavy on procedure, the procedure itself is interesting with a decent range of choices that players have to make. Mostly this amounts to bombardment allocation and the type of attack you want to make (maneuver or assault) but you'll also have some tough decisions to make regarding retreat, hot LZ's, and so on.

My concerns revolve mainly around a d10 resolution system for everything, with modifiers typically in the +1/-1 range in practice. The net result is that you can get some pretty extreme results at each end, leaving you with the feeling that the dice are controlling the narrative more than you are.

I'm also not sure how fun it will be to play the NVA forces without the hidden unit rules for anything but the full campaign, which may be too long to be practical for most people.

Update: Having played a couple turns of scenario #10, it sure feels like the ability of the FWA to whip around lots of firepower largely nullifies the hidden movement of the NVA. Between patrols and helicopters those units are going to get spotted sooner or later. Then the FWA player can bring enough firepower to conduct both Maneuver and Assault, preventing escape. Then it's Hulk Smash time. That said, I'm not ready to give up on the game yet, not until I've tried the other campaign scenarios.

Rated on not wanting to play again.  

The scenarios are very limited as many don't even use the map, and the ones that do don't cover the main action of the battle.

The campaigns, besides being long, have some questionable design decisions that look like they came along with the new edition.  The ability of the FWA to drop operational LZs at will doesn't seem historically accurate, and it certainly isn't fun as the NVA.  Same with the new leaders that relocate by helicopter every turn to whatever battle is most important.  The hidden movement ambush hardly makes up for these new powers granted the FWA.

It should be noted that I played the #10 campaign, which is basically a smash-fest for the NVA.  Why this is even included as a viable thing to play is beyond me.  The only VP for them to get is to run away, and a number of units might not have enough MP over the 8 turns to get away, even if the FWA let them.  Cycle is a helicopter/patrol combo spots units, every air unit in South Vietnam kills half of them, an Operational LZ appears 1 hex away, and 1-sided battle occurs that wipes them from the map.

Assuming this game is designed accurately, I guess it explains why we so thoroughly won The Vietnam War.  Oh, wait, we didn't.  Hmmm...

I have yet to play, but made the purchase because of the mechanics and the use of terrain.  Also, the advance game uses a variety of helicopters and artillery.  I think this game will be loads of fun to play time and again.

The scale of this game is one that I tend to avoid, however, I bought it on a whim.  Wow.  The graphics are excellent, the production and extras are incredible.  The rules aren't overly complex (by wargame standards) but they convey the asymmetry between the two sides very well.  I also appreciate the fact that neither side can just continuously shove their troops in the meat grinder turn after turn hoping the other side will break first.  Very much look forward to playing this one.

Silver Bayonet covers grand tactical airmobile combat in the Ia Drang valley of Viet Nam.  The four campaign scenarios cover division-scale battles with company-sized units.  A campaign plays out in a day or two, depending on turn count.  The smaller scenarios play out in an hour or two, but the first three are unbalanced training exercises.  The other four are suitable for quick head-to-head play.  The campaigns offer a lot operational decision making for both players due to the air mobility of the Americans.  You can literally pull a brigade out of a fight and insert it into another across the board in two or three turns.  Of course, once a US force is on the ground it's slower than the NVA. The NVA slows down to US speed if they move stealthily though.  Even solo this mix of stealth and air mobility makes for some operational cat-and-mouse with a lot of room for experimentation.  With all these options, replay value is high.  

The system gives a good feel for the asymmetries of the two armies.  NVA is faster on the ground and harder hitting on offense, but US is stronger on defense and has much better support (arty, helo, and air).  The result is both a good simulation and a fun game.  Silver Bayonet provides good thought problems solo and would be a real nail-biter head-to-head.  The system would also be suitable for off-the-cuff experimentation and player-generated scenarios.  It would be interesting to see if it could be ported to Afghanistan, either in the 1980s or the 2000s.

The rules are generally clear, but not quite up to GMT's perfection standard.  For instance, replacements seem to wipe out loss-related victory points since losses aren't scored till the end of the game, yet you're given loss counters for tracking them during the game.  An apparent contradiction.  A few errata are going to be needed once more play reports come in.  The index is a nice, and much needed, touch.


Even by GMT standards the materials are outstanding: the mounted map lays flat and stays put, the player aid cards are robust and include both sequence of play and crib sheet.  The pieces are NATO standard and rather thick.  That helps as stacks are often five or six high.

I watched We Were Soldiers in mid-2016.   So I pre-ordered this.  Simple cause and effect.

The game is beautifully produced:  great map; nice counters; amazing array of player aids; clear rules (with colour example of play).

The system gels pretty easily after a few plays.  I have been working my way (solo) through the basic game scenarios in the recommended order (from the pure training scenarios on down).  I have a decent understanding of the mechanics (although still to dive into helicopters and airmobility, but even that does not appear too hard to work out).

But ...

I am having a hard time seeing how the PAVN player can compete on equal terms with the FWA, at least before one gets to the hidden movement mechanics of the advanced game.

The FWA player has an abundance of air and artillery support in most situations that have come up so far.  The PAVN units are hard to co-ordinate.

In situations which commonly demand attacks from the PAVN, the casualty ratios are often quite high (PAVN:FWA).

So I have enjoyed learning the game; marvelled at its physical standards; understood the rules; but been puzzled at how the PAVN can be competitive, especially when it needs to attack.

Hidden movement might be the answer - although airmobility presumably cancels out much of the advantage which that gives to the PAVN player.

Time will tell - I want to like this, in play, more than I do at present.  Actually, I want to get excited about playing a game, and I don't have that about Silver Bayonet, at least not yet.

An unbelievably fun game. It's detailed, thematic, and this new version is beautifully redone. I saw the old graphics and well.. let's just say game design has come a long way since then! The sequence of play can seem long and fiddly, but once you see it in action and what it all means, it really shines. The amount of artillery and other rolls really highlights the furious nature of the bombardments from cannons, air support and other sources. Hopefully you don't have to call Broken Arrow!

Silver Bayonet is a great tactical simulation of warfare in Vietnam.    For 1990, this was a revolutionary game for it hidden movement rules for the NVA.  This 25th anniversary version is a better looking game as the graphics are updated from the 1990 version. Purchase the GMT 2016 version.  You will not regret it.  This is not a game for war game beginners, there are some mechanical hurtles that a more experienced players will adapt to easier.

RATING: 7
The components are some of the best I've seen. Having not played the original game, I have to say that these rules are not especially well done as there seemed to be a lot of poorly explained sentences. However, of the scenarios I played, they were pretty close, so play balance seems good. Some scenarios are a bore, though. In other words, you just sit and watch the VC hammer their heads against US bases and hope for a good die roll. Rating may change after playing the campaign game.

Beautiful game and the rules are very clear. Campaign is sadly very dependent on hidden movement so I'll have to figure a system for that.

Played Scenario #1 today vs. Mitch Land, who updated Gene's original game with a new map and thorough revision.  The scenarios are to teach the campaign which I want to play suing hidden PAVN-VC movement.  The game flows very well and it's great at illustrating the limits of vehicles in jungle terrain.  You're road-bound.  My impression after one scenario is very favorable.

Very nice components. The split between basic and advanced rules can be a bit confusing when trying to locate a specific rule.

The gameplay is very evocative, if a bit long - the US turn can take a while, in particular.  Overall, very pleasant.

Really enjoying running through the scenarios and learning something about these battles.  Just read We were soldiers once... and young.  Really adds to the game.  Much better than the film.

First war game for me and having a blast learning it. So far I’ve played scenarios 6(a+b), 3, 5, and 4. All solitaire so far but really looking forward to busting it out with my gaming friend. I was a bit intimidated by the rules at first but after playing the scenarios over and over, consulting the book and the awesome community here (thank you all for posting scenario walkthroughs) I am confident in my handling of the game mechanics. A fun, challenging and beautifully done game - couldn’t recommend it more to anyone interested in the Vietnam war.

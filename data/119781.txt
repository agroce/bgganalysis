One of the first games I played upon my recent reintroduction to board gaming and one that showed me several new mechanics. The way time (and the cards) can move only in the forward direction brings about such unorthodox decisions that it's very unpredictable and the game can change on a dime.

Interesting take on time travel and the gameplay is quite straightforward while allowing for strategic play.  Luck of the draw seems like it could play a significant factor in determining the winner, however, and I'm not sure how much replayability you can get out of it.

UPDATE (11/23/13): Got in a second play and lowered my rating half a point.  Still seems like luck of the draw plays too great a factor for my taste.

Funny theme with some cool choices in what techs to establish and when. Very 'push your luck' in deciding what time period to chance starting your tech at, but not much depth beyond that. Plus, the distribution of the special power (don't remember their name?) cards felt way too random and swingy.

This is a very well designed game, that unfortunately, I did not really find fun, and do not want to play again, so alas, I have to give it a 6.  I say alas, because I can see a lot of potentially interesting decisions in this game, with a potentially very interesting theme, and I sense a certain elegance to the design itself.  It has its heart in the right place, setting up differential point analysis and player prediction analysis.  

However, the card dependencies are not visually evident enough to the players looking at the card arrays (perhaps color codings could have been used, or a highlight behind the names of each technology card?), and thus, way too much time is spent looking for complicated dependencies in the later rounds.  This leads to AP in many players, and very long turns in a four player game.  Ultimately, the game will be won by the player who spends the most time staring at, and analyzing complex card dependencies, which for me, is just not fun enough, not where I want to spend my gaming time.  Then again, I also don't like staring at rondelle wheels, and mancala dropping patterns (Trajan anyone?), so maybe it's just me.

RATING: N/A
Played once (2 player game) and barely eeked out a win. We both screwed up our first turn, immediately jumping as far back in time as we could and spent the rest of the round drawing cards after filling up the age with techs. The game definitely forces you to think about things differently since you can only jump backwards and not forwards in time. I think the fate cards are a bit swingy and there could be balance issues there (would need to play more to see for sure). I'm unclear how you can build some of the later techs though, as they have a great deal of prereqs and you only have so many actions to influence existing tech, jump through time, play new techs. Maybe with more players its easier? Maybe if we hadn't of screwed up one fifth of the game it wouldn't have seemed so insane?

RATING: 5.5
A tech tree game with an odd movement mechanic (you can only move further back in time until the round ends).  This sounds interesting but ultimately is tedious and mildly annoying.  Timing is everything so it can be quite good to go last in the round to see what your opponents are doing before committing your precious influence cubes.  The inter-dependencies of the tech cards really make it tedious and painful to determine (calculate) which old/fundamental technologies you need to preserve, and who will benefit tangentially.  This really make the game drag with competitive and contemplative players.  The instant/one-shot cards are very powerful (chaotic), and I really dislike them.  Also, there's a lot of potential for tech card poaching/stealing and unhappiness.

There is so much about this game that is done right. It handles the time travel mechanic SO well. It's a mix of planning 2 or 3 steps ahead, hoping that the right cards will be played, and "worker placement" wrapped up in a box of awesome.

RATING: 8
Well produced and interestingly different - win by travelling back through time to control the history of human invention.

There's some randomness in the card draw, but the selection involved, and the lack of limitations on draws and hand size, means there are mitigating tactics, so that's not a major issue. It develops from a game of exploring, evaluating and exploiting options into one of protecting, expanding and consolidating your investments and the mix of actions you use each turn changes as the game goes on as a consequence.

The rules are fairly straightforward and relatively easy to grasp - it makes sense for example that both fire and the wheel need to have been discovered in some earlier era in order for the combustion engine to be invented - and you can quickly get into the swing of things. Overall, probably 8/10 for me - a very enjoyable game which I'd happily play again.

RATING: 7
Legacy is definitely a game that is greater than the sum of its parts.  The actions and game play are very simple, with some basic hand management and area majority as the main engine, but the way they are assembled along with some key rules creates a great tension.

Basically, in Legacy, players are playing various inventions throughout time.  Some are base inventions, like fire, religion, simple tools, electricity, etc, while others are more advanced and need one or more base inventions in order to function, with all of those bases needing to be further in the past than the invention itself.

The trick is that any player can benefit from any other player's stuff, or even screw other players out of stuff by playing the same invention earlier in time.  You can even screw other players out of points by later placing influence on inventions in an area majority-type exercise.

Another trick is that during each round, players are only allowed to move backwards in time, so once you go back, you can't jump up into the future, which results in some really difficult decisions.  As there is limited space for inventions in each era, sometimes you will really need to jump back in time to get something done, but at the expense of something you wanted to do further in the future!

To add to the tension, old inventions slowly fade away unless someone places more influence on them to keep them alive.  So, your hospital that needed sanitation to score any points will suddenly be useless if sanitation fades away.  Managing all of this is like trying to keep 10 plates spinning at a time, and you'll inevitably drop a few due to lack of actions and opponent screwage!

Overall, as I mentioned, definitely a game that takes a very simple ruleset and makes a good, tense game of it.

It is not a bad game. Players have to spend many rounds to draw cards they want.  The final score also depends on how good the sequence you can achieve.  I believe this game can achieve a good BGG rating if the cards will have a better design (set pattern & colors, bigger fonts etc.) Scoring is tedious at the end of each round.  Simplifying the scoring can make the game flies.

This game is a mix of some very good ideas with a terrible user interface.  The two main interface issues are (1) it's far too hard to track the dependencies when the board gets crowded (unless you're willing to slow the game WAY down by laboriously scanning every card every turn), and (2) the layout of the information on each card hides the important information when you're holding the cards in your hand.

This game has a fantastic theme, which I adore, very interesting gameplay, and cool artwork. It's definitely a well-designed game, and I can't wait to play again. It plays a little on the long side for what it is, however, and I think it's also somewhat prone to analysis paralysis. Also, if you fall behind, it seems like it's very difficult to catch up.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play - 3 players, without Fate cards or player objectives.

My first impression of this game is very favourable - I've played a few time travel themed games and I think that this one best integrates the theme into an interesting and approachable game.

The game has a good arc; with tension points shifting naturally from card-play in the early rounds to movement-timing and placing of influence cubes in the later rounds.

The artwork is a little whimsical for my tastes but does have a few nice thematic touches.

I'm looking forward to playing this some more.

Felt like it had a rich get richer issue with the influence cubes.  I also hate the take that element of the cards.  I would have much preferred the game be the mildly interesting but straightforward game of setting up inventions in the timeline.  That was fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is essentially a "take that" type card game. You can spend a lot of effort trying to make intelligent plays but really your scoring is at the whim of other players.  The Fate cards can randomly change the game out of nowhere.  It is good to draw these cards as they don't cost an action to play (maybe they should) and they can smack someone pretty good.  So ideally these cards are used to bash the leader, but often that is not how they are going to be used.  In our game it became the dreaded "Don't play that one on me, play it on him."  
So a good deal of kingmaking in this one.  Besides the Fate cards, you have the ability (if you draw well) to play a duplicate tech card earlier in time which all of a sudden takes a more recent out of play (swinging points vastly). Basically another "take that" which is doled out randomly in card draw.  Last, there is the influence allocation which is my least objectional "take that" mechanism in the game.  At least you can see that coming and try to prepare for it a la El Grande...by countering with your own cubes or via a counter takeover of that person's tech.

I'd play it again, but wouldn't be excited to do so.

Wow, I was not expecting such a satisfying game . When I first heard of this, I quietly passed it by thinking it was just going to be a dry experience.  While the theme doesn't quite come through for me (it never stopped being cards and cubes in my head), the decisions and the sequence of play are outstandingly satisfying.

If you're anything like me, the strategy is going to click in later than it ought to if only because the concept is a bit weird.  Once it clicks, however, you're off to the races.  For example, in the game I played, I really misplayed my first two turns, putting me in dead last with 3 or 4 points while everyone was in the teens, 20s or above.  I thought I had lost completely until I had that wonderful "aha" moment and started baring my teeth by stealing everything out from under everyone.  Did I make friends?  No.  But I did have a glorious comeback and made just short of 2nd.  Had I played my first two turns differently, I might have won.

"Baba, yo no se."

Not a bad idea, but the game isn't interesting enough.  There is too much card referencing to make the prerequisite building any fun, and often special actions can be overlooked.  I also felt there was a lot of times when the only good thing to do on my turn was to draw cards, which inevitably were not helpful.  I didn't feel like there were meaningful decisions.  It just didn't grab me at all.

Quite liked it. Whyohwhyohwhy do publisher make the icons so bloody small? Acres of space on the cards, teeny tiny icons. I did like the going back in time but not forward part. That forces you to irrecoverable choices. I did like having earlier technologies to support later ones, but you can build the later one first and support it afterwards in the rounds. The balance of points and cost could have been better, likewise the actual tech tree. Apparently, you only need Electricity to invent Radio, not Mining or Writing or Logic or Fire.

We didn't play with the Fate cards, and I can see how they would cause some issues.

I think there's a very good game here, it just needs more work.

So fiddly. 

So very underdeveloped. 

Such poor presentation of gameplay-critical information.

There's a kernel of a reasonable game in there, somewhere, but this game needed a couple of rounds of real development and real art-direction/graphic design.

Should have been a casual browser game, not a boardgame.

Yet another kickstarter that's essentially a waste of everyone's time, effort, and money.

First play took a bit of time as people tried to work out what was going on, the tech trees, etc.  Influence cubes are the key to success it seems.  Some of the fate cards are very powerful, with the 'take that' aspect and potential kingmaking.  Seemed like you ran into flat spots where there was nothing to do but draw cards (eg last 6 actions of round 1) but that might vary from game to game.  Unless the speed of play comes down will struggle to get to table.

I played at That Board Game Thing and enjoyed it enough to order a copy.  I'm a sucker for (good) time travel stories so the theme of this game is instantly appealing.  The mechanism of working backwards through time to make the discoveries necessary to support the discoveries you played farther up the time line.  Another way of describing it is you're building a house starting with the roof and ending with the foundation.  I think it's quite clever and a lot of fun.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2014)

I was pleasantly surprised by Legacy: Gears of Time.  At first I didn't want to play the game but I'm glad a friend insisted :).

The rules are easy to grasp and the game flows quickly with at most 3 players. With more I think the game begins to drag a bit and luck begins to increase.  I really like the art of the game.

Legacy has a very interesting theme (Time Travel) and the game mechanics support it very well. It also has some area control elements (controlling techs) AND it is very tense because each player only have 3 actions per turn and it feels like they aren't enough. It has very interesting decisions. 

I also liked how the cards have multiple purposes (like RFTG) and, in general, I feel it has a low luck factor (controlled luck because there are repeat cards, you can use what your opponents play and there is synergy between many cards), however I really dislike the special cards because they aren't balanced/fair, it is pure luck if you draw one and they disrupt your ability to plan. One of them prevents a player from scoring a tech,  very unfair.  If it wasn't for them I would rate the game higher. 

Bottom line, Legacy: Gears of Time is a good game with surprising depth. I think it's best played with 2 players.  I want play it more and I will probably buy it.

2016-04-24 - 7 - It's an area control game with - for me - very cool and underused theme of time travel. And most of mechanisms really make sense in that regard. The game can be mean but in a funny way and after someone screwed you over, you immediately can see that you let him do it.

2016-05-23 - 7->6 - I reconsidered my rating. The game is OK but I'm not as eager to play it again as other titles I rated with 7.

Cool game, but i found that it plays WAY better if you make some simple changes 

1. Only play three round! This is the most important. The fourth round just drags for way to long and adds nothing to the game

2. When playing three rounds the persuit tech becomes unbalanced. Thus they should be ignored

3. Remove the fate cards from the game. Some of them is super unbalanced. Being able to swing 10 points with a single card is just way to powerful. Moving someone back in time against their will can destroy their entire round.

I LOVE time travel. The whole concept of going back in time and creating an invention which then removes somebody elses later creation of the same invention just makes my mind giggle and make me feel all happy. I love the way you can only go backwards in time too, so you have to really consider the end before the means. Wish I could play it more. Might just buy it for myself.

Time travel is hard to do well in a game, and I think this one does it well. Also love the mechanism of using cards for multiple things.

The one part I don't like about it is how other players can try to take over cards you've established. It's more confrontational than I like.

In Legacy: Gears of Time players are time travellers.   They travel back through the ages bringing various technologies into existence, and attempting to control them to score points.

It is a fairly simple game.  The rule book contains only about 4 pages of actual rules.  On a player's turn they take three actions, in any order, and as many times as they want.  They can either: take two cards (which mostly contain the technologies) and discard one, or establish a technology (by playing a card and paying its cost with other cards), or influence a technology (by putting cubes of your colour on it), or travel back in time.

However, within those few actions lies a very deep and thinky game.  Technologies can come into, and disappear from, the time-line.  As technologies are established more advanced technologies can arise.  Those more advanced technologies can fail however, if one or more of the earlier technologies it depends on fades from history.  So, there is a strong area control-like mechanism involved, as players attempt to wrest control of various technologies from each other to keep them in existence, and to get the corresponding points.  Also, there are multiple cards of each technology.  If a given technology is established in two different periods of history, the earlier one will win out (as of course something can't be invented twice).  So, it behooves players to establish technologies as early in the time-line as possible.  This give rise to a strong push-your-luck element.  As, for the most part, you can only travel back in time during each round.  So, you want to go back as far as possible, but if you do you will be stuck far back in the past with little flexibility as to what you can do on your turn.  On the other hand, you can establish a technology later in the time-line, but risk someone going back further in time and establishing the same technology making yours irrelevant.

The game is four rounds long, comprising four turns each.  During each turn players get three actions.  Even with all these rounds, turns, and actions players will never be able to do everything that they'll want to.  This makes for some very tough decision making along the way.  However, the game also has some levity.  The artwork on the cards is silly.  But also, there will be moments in the game where unexpected things will occur.  For example, the last time I played it was later in the game, we had established things like the internet, but because no one controlled fire, and the wheel they fell out of existence in the time-line.  Imagine our society with the internet, but no way to cook our food, or use wheeled transportation! 

Anyway, whomever navigates through the ever-changing history of the world best, by bringing into existence various technologies, and maintaining control over them, will get the most points, and win.

Legacy: Gears of Time is one of my all time favourite games.  If you like area control, push your luck, or the idea of time travel I suggest you get your hands on this game now!

At first I thought that every playthrough would be similar, since we got 80% of the technologies built in the first game I played, but as I've played it more, the games do have a lot of variation. I've played games where half of the technology built is removed from the game before it's over and sometimes almost all the technologies are on the board.

Mini-review I posted to the Google+ Board Games Community: 

Okay so we got a four-player game of Legacy: Gears of Time in last night. This is a very clever game...very, very clever. But not without its problems! 

The game works like this: There are four rounds of play, after which you score points based on your influence over various technologies arranged chronologically. In my picture attached (don't know why it's turned 90 degrees), the far left is the farthest back in time and the right is the farthest forward in time. This is a photo from the fourth and final round. 

Basically it's a cutthroat area control game, where the "area" is a three-deep technology tree. Certain techs are required by certain other techs, and you get paid not only for "influencing" (no idea what this represents in the game's fiction...maybe it really is just like...your character's hand in making a certain technology come to pass in the past) a technology, but also for future technologies on which your tech is based.

I totally misplayed my game, focusing on juicy high-end techs that pay really well...but only pay once. The winners kept control over "fundamental" techs, things like basic tools and basic science and writing, that continue to resonate throughout the tech tree up through time.

The time travel theme is extremely well executed, which surprised the hell out of me. Every round, all your dudes start in the "modern day" (the little brown shield off the map on the right in that picture). On your turn (you get 4 of them every round), you can do 3 actions. Actions are: moving back (and only back) in time, dropping a new tech into your current column (columns grow in capacity as you go back in time), "influencing" a tech in your current column, or drawing cards from the deck. The fact that you can only move backward, never forward, really messes with your head and your ability to plan. I think this one rule is what produces 90% of that great time travel vibe: I want to control the Internet, so eventually I need to go back and control electricity, the radio and analytical engines. 

There are a few "fate" cards, which aren't technologies, that are mostly fuck-your-neighbor effects. There aren't many of them, which I feel makes the game potentially swingy. Also, since you can harvest and keep cards from round to round, this means lots of crazy antics crop up in that fourth and final round.

Oh! I forgot: There's this very clever little economy in the game in addition to the cards. You start with a supply of cubes but no "influence." But influence is how you score on cards! So when you play a new tech, you pull cubes out of your personal supply equal to the cost to play the card (it's a pay-cards-to-play-cards game, like Race for the Galaxy). Then, when you're scoring, the "winner" on each tech pulls back one cube, and that becomes their available "influence." So therefore if you play more techs early, you get more influence later. This does a nice job of shaping play: the first round is all setup, the second round is kind of maneuvering around and pre-empting each other's techs (if you play, say, Logic in an earlier era than the Logic that's already in play, that later Logic will get nuked out of the time stream), the third round is setting up big advanced techs, and the fourth round is Fate card craziness and one big Influence blowout. It's pretty great that they've come up with such a clever, indirect way to shape play.

Once again I find myself looking at a Kickstarter'ed game and shaking my head at the state of the rulebook. It's missing fundamental stuff, like how to set the game up properly. We spent a good 20 minutes scouring their website and eventually their BGG forums for answers. There are special "fate" cards that are played instantly, but when and how they work is not always intuitive. There are only six of them; they could have easily had a page explaining each card in the rulebook. There were other minor frustrations, all of which could have been solved with a couple outside groups commenting on their draft PDF before going to press. The game is 99% fine and it's certainly playable without houseruling anything.

I'm tentatively giving this an 8 out of 10 for now, largely due to the emergent  clever gameplay properties and my abiding love for the theme. It'd be higher but I confess I am slightly concerned about repeat gameplay. Due to the pre-emption effect (earlier techs nuke later techs) it seems very likely that you'll see similar or repeat tech trees emerge by the end of the game. I'm not sure if gameplay itself is harmed by this! It's just something on my mind.

RATING: 7
Legacy: Gears of Time is a game where you're literally trying to build a technology tree in reverse order--that is, starting with the most advanced technology cards, and then proceeding to move back through time and play its prerequisites.  In each round, your player pawn can only play technology cards wherever it is in the timeline, and can only move back in time.  Thus, you have to rely on either yourself or other players to play the prerequisites (it's worth points for whoever does) for your more advanced technologies to score.  Additionally, the same technology started at an earlier time period will supersede one played later on the timeline.  The result is a game that's very thematic but a little snipey, as players play a big role which technologies actually happen.  Fortunately, as players mostly score the most points for working together, this sort of thing doesn't happen too much unless there's a clear target.  I enjoyed this game despite the negative player interaction, as it felt really thematic and was pretty unusual.  The art is absolutely fantastic, too.

I like the reverse planning in this game, as well as the mechanism of using cards to pay for other cards. There is quite a bit of tension that comes from determining whether it is best to lay a new technology or to invest your cubes on an existing technology. This is a game that defintely requires multiple play to understand how best to time actions and how grand the scope of your technologies can be in a given round. The two downsides for me are (1)there can be a bit of a runaway leader issue, as folks doing well will acquire more influence cubes, allowing them to do even better in subsequent rounds and (2)for such a strategy heavy game there can be quite a bit of luck in your card draws.  The luck element is exacerbated a bit by the relatively unforgiving nature of the game. If your planning is off by one action point, you can loss all your scoring opportunities for the round (I'm ok with this, but it can make it hard for new players to compete with seasoned players). Overeall, a fun strategic game, best played with other experienced players.

Some unique gameplay elements, but a linear score track, "rich get richer" style gameplay and analysis-paralysis inducing tech tree made this overstay its welcome. The winner is decided in the first of four rounds, the final three just add insult to injury. 20 minutes of fun dragged out into a 2-hour game.

First impressions after a 2p game: very tactical game, with lots of stuff going on, enough to be worried about AP when playing with that kind of player. Plenty of interaction. The time-traveling mechanic is the best I've seen, and the brilliance is in past-only traveling direction stuff (that creates a lot of decisions).

I can imagine this game being very chaotic with more than two players, just the thought gives me headaches.

This game is everything but light.

Have a few complaints about production: insert is strange; with few alterations it would be possible to have a box half the size.

Update (february 2013): Sold my copy. I still like the game, and stand by my rating. I've sold it because it's a game I would only play 2-player or 3-player games, and we are normally 4 (4 is way chaotic).

We played this with 2 players and It did not work for us at all. this game appears to have a major 'reward the leader' component, where the cards you play can be killed by earlier copies of the same card. Then the cards that still remain produce a resource for players who didn't get killed, which allow them to conquer other player's remaining cards. It's possible we just didn't play this very strategically the first time, but my game partner was so turned off by my completely devastating his first turn (and subsequent turns since he had no hope of catching up since my higher resource production meant I could maintain control of anything he tried to do), that I don't know if I'll be able to get this back to the table with him. I'm honestly shocked, because I had read this was a really fantastic game with 2, and it's pretty highly rated.

An interesting tech-tree game wherein tech trees are built backwards starting with the end and then trying to get the requirements built.  Having all the requirements on a card is a nice touch that minimizes needing to look up the requirements.

We didn't find it that hard to keep track of the various cards in play, but then again have a nice table to play on with lots of room to lay every thing out.  

Game does play relatively quickly (90-120 minutes) even with rules explanation for beginners so can expect to see games being quicker with experience.  Didn't play with the expansion, but like what it adds.

--Jan2014-- It's a mixed bag: on the one hand, the set of decisions one can make are interesting.  On the other, the physical presentation of the game obfuscates a lot of information that one needs to make good decisions.  Unlike some other games for which I've levelled that "less clear than one might desire" complaint, I think this one is fixable...  But I'm not (yet) certain how.  Needs pondering.

the good: theme is well implemented and illustrations do stand out in the crowd and are quite charming. What you get is a game about time travel and inventions and doing chains of events. The way the game handles tech tree is original, even though it's hard to keep track of all the details and you must keep track of them.

the bad: Though the mechanics and the structure of the game are somewhat unique the gameplay is pretty much euro puzzle of recent times. The interaction is all about doing something before someone else does it - it's a game of advantage and positions, not of creativity. Sure, there's some area control, but it's not that easy to take advantage of it. 

And take that cards (fate cards) would probably be best being left out or having some sort of mechanism how to distribute them amongst players. 

the ugly: rules are terribly written - it's hard to find what you want even if you're staring at that exact space where it's written. The lack of graphic designer shows and how. Firstly the rules need some examples. Secondly the game layout is hard to read - there's a lot of cards to keep track of and a clever graphic design tcould help with this readability problem. Basically it's quite obvious that this is a kickstarter game - lacks proper development.

Another indie game that could have been great if it'd been independently developed. As is, it has a lot of sharp edges that can lead to partial failure of the game if the players don't play in a specific way and it gets unwieldy at game end as you're trying to figure out what supports what. With that said, it's the best integration of time travel and game mechanics that I've seen.

Legacy: Gears of Time is one of the best games released via Kickstarter.  Although this is really a card game with a board, it contains so much subtle complexity.  The theme and artwork is great, and the game play and mechanisms do manage to capture the time travel vibe.  At it's heart, this is an area control/influence game and can get quite tactical.  However, there are many, many strategies that can be employed.  No two games play quite the same due to the variety in the technology tree.  2-3 players is the best way to play since 4-player games can run a bit long.  However, there is a possibility to establish a greater mix of technologies as well as getting more of the higher technologies into play with more players involved.  I really like this game, wish I was able to play it more, and highly recommend it every chance I get.

I was disappointed in my first play of this game - after reading the banter I was expecting something more.  It felt slow, boring and not at all challenging although to be fair it was a 2-player game.

Edit 11/14/13

I sure do not understand the ratings or ravings about this game.  I am not sure this will ever see the table again - it left such a bland impression on me and there are so many other wonderful games out there ... I am going to rate it based on 1 play but will modify should i ever get it on the table again.

Time travel table top games are difficult to accomplish as it's very difficult to keep track of events in the past and how they will/would effect the present/future. I haven't played in a while, but from what I remember, this game is unique in how it has players traverse time within the constraint of a day and then everything resets to "present" and everything progresses by one day. Awesome concept.

Lots of hype at BGG.CON among the group about this, so I had to play. The premise is interesting, but the problem is that I think that you don't have enough flexibility to deal with both the cards you're dealt and your opponents and so often it is the one that isn't ganged up by the others that gets the win. If it weren't for the screwage in this game, it would be a 5 (or worse).

This seems like such a cool game! Time travel is a cool idea, and tech trees are also cool. But the game didn't quite do it for us: the rule book (1st edition) isn't that great, the cards are annoying (you can't fan them and see the important information) and have kinda ugly art, there was no info on the details of the cards/tree (how many of each, what relates to what), and it's difficult to see which cards will be scoring when -- this game is perfect for an app that will overlay all the little connections of technologies! Also, the randomness of the cards (Fate cards are annoying, and some people hardly ever even saw any; the high-value cards are rare and again, only seen by a few) was a bit too much for us.

But I want to like the game! It's got a great theme and pretty interesting play: an area-control game, with a few twists (only travel one direction in time, adding influence as you go; tech dependencies; turn order interaction). Maybe I'll try it with 2...

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Everyone starts with 5+(turn order) cards in hand. The original play area has 3+n columns (timeframes). Each round starts with all player pawns to the far right of the columns.

There are 4 game Rounds, each with 4 Turns. On your Turn, take 3 Actions. These can be any combination of:
- travel backwards (left) in time as far as you want
- draw 2 cards, discard 1 of them
- place influence cubes (from your Influence POOL) onto a card in your column
- play a tech card into your column (unless column limit has been reached, or that card already in the column): pay the cost shown (in cards) and place that same number of influence cubes (from your Influence SUPPLY) onto the card
- Fate Cards may also be played; they do NOT count as an Action

At the end of each Round, evaluate all techs from left to right (farthest back in time first):
- any techs with 0 cubes on them fail; discard card, return cubes to SUPPLY
- techs with cubes but without prerequisite techs in earlier columns: discard all copies of card except rightmost; that card loses 1 cube from player with most cubes on it. All lost cubes go to SUPPLY
- techs with cubes and successful prereqs in play: reward controlling player VP for card, and for all future techs using that tech. Return 1 cube to controlling player's Influence POOL
Then, in order of cubes in POOLs (lowest to highest; ties broken by having fewer VP), players choose their turn order for next Round. Finally, draw up to a hand size of 6.

Game ends after 4 full Rounds; most VP wins!

RATING: 6
This is an interesting game.  Each player takes on the role of a time traveler traveling back in time and inventing technologies and scoring points for having the most influence over that technology at the end of each round.  This makes it a kind of area control game that takes place in time.

The rules are reasonably simple and the artwork appears to denote this as a lighter, simpler game but there is a lot of nuance and paths to take and tons of decisions and consequences to consider with every action.  Many technologies depend on other technologies being invented first, but you can supersede another player's technology by inventing it earlier.  You can also allow another player to invent a technology but gain influence over it and you can only go back, not forward through time.  Each time period can also only hold a certain number of inventions as well, all of this and more makes this a pretty complex game in reasonably simple trappings.

For this reason I like this game quite a bit.  I like games that you can get up and running with a lot of different people but also provides a lot of thought and interesting gameplay to work through.  I think I may prefer this more with 2 or even 3 than the full complement of 4 though.  With 4 there are a lot of things going on at once and though this makes the game more dynamic, which is good, it introduces a lot of down time not just in player turns but also in the bookkeeping phase at the end of each round where you have to find which technologies fade, calculate scores, return influence, etc.

From one play through I can see where one bad round will finish you in the game.  I ended a round with 2 influence cubes my opponent's 8 and the game was over.  Still the mechanic is very cool and the game is pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it.  I look forward to more plays!

Also, not super thrilled with the quality of construction.  After one week my main board is warping and the box insert was a total mess from the get-go.

I really enjoyed the first half of the game, but by the end of round 2 I really felt as though I'd seen everything interesting in the game and now we just had to do it for another two rounds. That coupled with the terrible graphic design and the need to have to work out all of the chains rather than having them presented clearly to me, made the game more like work than play.

Others have said it and I'll echo it; this is why we have publishers - not just to actually produce and ship the games, but to develop and polish the games. This is severely lacking in Legacy.

I have mixed feelings about this one. It mostly felt like a well-designed game, with fun mechanics that match the theme really well.

It seemed to have a runaway leader problem. I shot ahead in round 1, which gave me more cubes to influence cards in round 2, and my lead never really seemed at risk after that. However, it was only 1 game and it may be just be a matter of experience. The other players didn't use all their cards. So at the start of round 2, I got 6 more cards, while they only got 1 or 2. Had they used their full hand, as well, it might have been a different story.

The other problem seemed to be that there was little incentive to lay down big cards. It's difficult to get all the prereqs out, and owning some or all the prereqs seems a better way to snag points. But, again, it just may be a question of experience. Laying out a strong card early can incentive your opponents to play some of the prereqs, and you start out with a bunch of influence that can still be around later in the game...

Overall, I enjoyed it and it played quickly.

Finally, the art is fantastic. Some of the best I have seen in a boardgame.

Legacy is a card driven game about traveling back in time and inventing technologies.

You build technology cards by paying the cost in discarded cards.  You get to put as many of your cubes on the tech as you had to discard cards to build it.  Whoever has the most cubes on it will score points for it... but only if you fix the time continuum so that all the underlying techs exist at the round end.  

If you discover the combustion engine in the third era, you'd best go back in time and discover fire and the wheel prior to that or else the combustion engine will just be some crackpot theory that never came to be.  But the neat thing is that someone else might help you out and discover those... because when the combustion engine scores, fire and the wheel will score again as part of the engine's scoring, meaning that fire and the wheel will score twice this round.  

Every round, the person with the most cubes on a tech takes one off of it and brings it to his personal supply.  From them on, as an action, he can put as many cubes as he wants, and has, on one tech... which means he can take over a tech you spent time building.  Oh and if a tech has it's last cube taken off, that tech will disappear at the round end, invalidating everything that builds off that tech.

There's also some trickery afoot.  If someone goes back and discovers fire in an era prior to when you did, it invalidates your discovery and the earliest discovery supersedes the later one.

You start each of the four rounds in the present but the rub is that in each round you can only go backwards in time.  Which means that you are often building your tech chains in reverse order.  And each era can only hold a certain number of techs, so the guy to race further back in the past can build the early techs which will score often, and the guy who waits to go back in time can swoop in and put his cubes on your tech, stealing it from you.  When to time travel and how far is tricky to figure out.  The techs generally stick around, assuming they have cubes, so things become more obvious as the game draws to a close.

It's interesting and fairly unique.

A cool thinky but short card game, which hurts your head by being played backwards. And then a few times you go way forwards but then backwards more. Good (usually) non-destructive interaction, and the small amount of special action cards makes it so it's not just crazy chaos. Plays nice and quick and after a play or two it gets nice and intuitive. I've only played it 2-player, but each of my plays has had interesting and tough decisions, plenty of "not enough time" tension, and surprising maneuvers. There's also plenty of tradeoff in the form of, "Do I help myself accomplish this, or just frustrate my opponent's plans?" The art style is unlike other games I've played as well, charming and differently cartoony.

It wasn't too difficult to figure out the mechanics, but the strategy of finding and establishing dependency trees is actually challenging.  The other strategy of having the most influence on high-scoring technologies adds yet another layer of challenge.  I'm sure my game buddies will love that. :)

Initial Rating after 1 Play

I thought this was a pretty clever game.  Manipulating time as a mechanic is not an easy thing to pull off.  It can just be some silly abstract arrow like in Vaccarino's game.  Legacy pulls it off pretty well as you need to travel back and forth in the timeline to establish technologies and manipulate what others have played.  There are some fun surprise moves you can pull off.

While I liked the game fine enough, it didn't "wow" me, I'd be happy to play it but it's not a game that I feel like I have to own.  As with any game based on cards, you can fall victim to luck of the draw.  The final round can get pretty mean as it's mostly all about stealing the most profitable tech's from other players.

The idea behind Legacy was enough to get me to back it on Kickstarter, and I'm pleased to see that it lived up to its potential.  It's a light-ish card game with an area majority mechanism, and the whole idea of going back in time to support an invention you create in the present day is boss.  Since you can only ever go back in time during the rounds, you have to weigh the benefits of an invention against the risk of not having what you need to carry it out.  It seems to be well balanced, and is one of the better Kickstarter games I've played thus far.  

The Fate cards are annoying, and I'm pondering the idea of leaving them out, but I can see the value of most of them.  The whole "Score no points for an invention" card, though?  No thanks.

A really enjoyable and different game.  Playing backwards is a bit of a brain burner, but not so much that AP sets in.  I think that since you are limited in choices by the cards in your hand, things can never get really out of control.

We are time travelers re-mapping the chronology of discovery, invention, and technology. Each of these discoveries in turn have interrelated dependencies to the future. The trick is how far back in time to play the pre-req tech that won't get capped by another player AND gives enough time to complete the chain? This strategic card game really stresses your gray matter at the end when you survey the card synergies to determine the best use of your influence. As a matter of principle I say no to time travel to avoid butterfly effect.

Interesting time travel game based on technologies. Go back in time and control the discovery of technologies. Score points for the tech as well as for more modern techs that use your tech in the future. The newer techs tend to score bigger points so don't let one person control all of them.

This might as well be called "Tech Tree: The Game" as you are trying to build and control a Civ style tech tree from the future back into the past.  The moves are pleasantly straight forward and trying to make time work for you is very interesting. I did find it very easy to focus on the area control element only to be undercut by the timestream element in a way that felt incredibly mean.  So mean in fact that there are a number of people I would avoid playing this with.  So... not a bad game and certainly unique... but also very much not for everyone.

This is what the world needs:  Streamlined time travel games that really work.  By keeping the tech tree shallow, [person=58140]Ben[/person] made this a viable concept.

The screwage by a person with gobs of influence going after you can be killer, so you kind of have to wait them out, which isn't a fun aspect of the game, but everything else is mighty nice.

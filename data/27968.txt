The map is huge... it doesn't fit on my table! The counters are of a type that lack silhouttes of tanks or infantry, but I suppose I'll get used to that. The art is pleasant, and I enjoy the small details like the encouraging words from Hitler to his troops prior to the invasion printed on the German side, with a similar statement from Stalin on the Soviet side. I do wish the game box was a bit sturdier, GMT like, as mine came with some dents from shipping.

RATING: 9
Monster game on russian campaign. Full of original and effective ideas. Two military doctrines are very different and well thought. The germans are master of breathrough and manouver in the early war, and later resort to elastic defence with panzers darting to recover enemy penetrations and dangers from the russian steamroller. Very effective is the slowly improving of russian army and the the direct link between the offensive buildup and how much of the russian industry is saved from invasion.
Only downside is that is a long game. The game stops in april 1944 before the disctruction of german army groups center and south. Some people criticized that. Probably wise on the perspective of shortening the game lenght avoiding the agony of the last year. Anyway I would like to have the counters and map for the last year. A must have and must play for eastern front vets.

The same compelling game play as its predecessor (War for the Motherland), with a clearer English rules set and an additional scenario. I think I still prefer the original Yamazaki artwork from Six Angles, but it doesn't much matter one way or the other. Still an outstanding wargame.

RATING: 7
Only played intro game twice and the Barbarossa scenario. Plays very nice, however Barbarossa is of course a bit of a drag for the Russian in the beginning.

Edit (After a play of the Russia resurgent scenario):
Slightly lower rating. In a long game I wish for slightly more complex combat resolution. Partisan system did not really work in the game.

Ran through the first 8 turns of this monster on my own.  The mechanics are fairly straight-forward, but ohhhh, how the board position and terrain create such varied options on how lay out the Soviet defenders or spearhead a blitzin' assault.

Very interesting game. My first all-encompassing East Front game.

I liked the scale/scope/breadth of it. The (very) different abilities of the armies, particularly as portrayed through the turn sequence, will take some getting used to. Very tough on the Soviets I think, so the more experienced player should play that side. 

This game has me intrigued for it's uniqueness alone.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: I've docked my rating on this game, not because I don't like it (I do for all the reasons below), but because of the poor mix of scenarios. This game really needs more 1-years secenarios (Summer - Spring). As it is, there's maybe one playable scenario (Summer '41 - Spring '42), one toy scenario, and a bunch of monsters. I'd be vastly happier with this product if there were some season-long or year-long scenarios for the mid-war, a la EastFront. As the game is now, it's too unplayable in general due to game length. Also, I'm a little irritated that the box advertises for up to 4 players but no multi-player rules are provided.
---
Played only once, but I was quite favorably impressed. I think it's found a very nice spot between the high-level (and therefore somewhat abstract) games like The Russian Campaign and Russia Besieged and the highly-detailed East Front Series. It has much more interesting operational details than the higher-level games: in those games it sometimes seems like an exercise in making sure you have continuous double lines, while in RSR not every hex can be garrisoned strongly (or even at all), so you have to make more choices, and those choices lead to a more fluid and interesting tactical situation. Also, I think the modelling of the Soviet army is absolutely terrific, with the chit-pull system allowing the army to improve in quality in a totally seamless and complexity-free way that also gives a feel for the uneven performance of Soviet units.

There are two problems:

- The overrun rules are, in my opinion, a little sketchy. You can move into hexes via overrun that you would not be allowed to move through if they were empty, and it is frequently faster to drive through an occupied space than it is to drive through  hole in the line. This is just plain odd, and causes some anti-intuitive decision-making for defenders. I like the overrun rules in general, I just wish you couldn't move through enemy units more cheaply than empty space in the movement phase. This is the sort of jarring inconsistancy that causes problems because you have to rely on analysis of a complicated situation rather than on intuition and heuristics. If a game is this big, it needs to be intuitive enough that players don't need to constantly re-analyze small decisions.

- The length of time to play. I was critical of A Victory Lost because I felt like you didn't get enough out of the game to justify the playing time (I haven't played it enough to judge, but I strongly suspect Fire in the Sky has the same problem). On the one hand, I didn't feel like there was a lack of game in Red Star Rising - quite the contrary, I found it engrossing, even as the Soviets in 1941. But that doesn't mitigate the length. From a plot arc perspective,  it's nice to be able to play Summer and Winter 1941 in one sitting, so that you can get the German onslaught followed by the first arrival of quality Soviet units and a decent counter-offensive opportunity. But, for our first game (and we weren't playing slowly, really) we were clocking in at an hour a turn, which means about 7 hours got us through August '41. I expect that to come down with some experience, but RSR is a big, long game. I definitely think it's worth playing, but doubt I'll be able to do it very often just because of the length and the lack of good, medium-sized scenarios; it's either the toy intro game or the monsters.

RATING: N/A
Great system. Hidden strengths for Soviet Armies nicely done. Clean, simple combat. asymmetrical move-combat/combat-move sequence works to impart a nice feel of German mobility/Russian doctrine. Helpful player aids all around the map. Absolutely love the historical unit icons on the counters rather than NATO symbols. Russian Leader modifiers forcing many Soviet attacks into "mandatory step loss" mode give an elegantly abstract portrayal of Hitler's no retreat mentality. 

A bit annoying having to constantly count supply lengths, though, especially for the Axis with their depot chains. And, initially, the counter colors seemed a bit too close to each other; this made it somewhat difficult to tell friend from foe at a glance in crowded sectors of the map. After numerous play sessions I'm glad to say this is no longer the case. However, these are minor nits when compared to all the plusses in this game.

All in all, I'm enjoying the heck out of this game. Best East Front game? Likely yes.

Sold 8/2009.

I never played it but it seemed to "fall between two stools". It seems to combine the simple abstract rules of a weeknight wargame with the length of a monster. I'd rather play OCS, Flat Top, or similar heavy if I'm going to commit to a game that's more than one session.

RATING: 7
Commendably pretty, easy to play, and doesn't seem as yet to be vulnerable to game breaking strategies. The rulebook is good, though the unconventional presentation can occasionally cause a bit of confusion and occasionally veers into my irritation zone. Components are very high quality.

Gameplay works very nicely. Mechanically simple, but with little tweaks that do a good job of introducing the nuances of the theatre without requiring excessive rules count. Playing it really gives you the feeling of being an overall commander, and there are definite incentives to making historical strategy decisions.

Most well-written rulebook, EVER.  But still a monster of a game.  Counters are alien to traditional wargamers.  Complex rules for advance after combat.

RATING: 6
A interesting take on the Russian Front.  That having been said, the Soviet side can be tough to love for the first several hours of play you'll be the punching bag worried with how best to place the reinforcements that never seem to be enough, and whether to take step loses or retreat.  And when I say several hours, I mean 6-8 hours.

It's almost like a solitaire game played by the Axis.

And then the first winter comes and the Axis attacks get more potent ... but more likely to damage them as well.  I'm not sure that works, and seems a mistranslation - ie only Soviet attacks should have (+) in winters.

As other note, attackers often pay less to overrun a defender during movement then to move through their ZOC ... in other words, units not the gaps between units are the weak points in your line - I've yet to adjust to this as the defender.

I wonder if two rules weren't mistranslated:
- overruns should cost terrain  PLUS 3 MP
- the winter +3/+1 attack "bonus" should only apply to Soviet attacks.

I prefer playing it in Vassal as the map is huge and it's great to have moves logged etc.  But retreats/step loses can be so critical to the Soviet ... be careful playing PBEM.

One of the most successful things about this game is the way it captures the Soviet desperation; the rules soooooo favor the Axis. Playing the Soviet is a draining emotional experience ... how many games can claim to recreate the emotional state of the protagonists?  And when the tide turns you feel the masses of Soviet forces driving West, striking back at their fascists tormentors! I feel that rage at times ... particularly when I can't see how the heck to strike back effectively, and I see the Axis forces attack three times each a turn - hell I have to attack then move - which makes offenses very difficult - it is a real challange for the Russian Bear to get a good solid hug.

Delicious and frustrating that the same time :D

The rulebook is a bit more conversational then I'd like perhaps and their easy of reading comes at the expense of clarity/brevity for experienced gamers.

There's more for both players to do and manage than in most EF games - and in a good way.  But I worry that the game becomes "long for what it is" particularly for the Soviet player, who must absorb *hours* of punishment before beginning to see the tide turn - if he's played well enough to survive.

I need to play more scenarios that begin in the mid war, when the Barbarossa Romp is over.

Barbarossa can really suffer from and "edge of the World" type phenomenon where the Axis forces can be used in an incredibly aggressive manner - because they don't have to survive into '43 and '44.

But let me be clear - if you like the East Front you should give this game a try for yourself.

In the end, I found that my initial fascination with this game's novel mechanics faded with repeated plays.  It was worth the cover charge, but I doubt I will ever play it again.

Have been gaming almost 50 years.  Own over 1,000 games.  This is a great and elegant game!  Lots of small things that add up to a great game.   As the German one feels good going into the last winter with a strong infantry and armor group.  At the end of the winter with every Russian unit attacking and overrunning any German in the way the tension for both side goes way up.  Victory/Defeat was determined on the very last impulse.  The early game is extremely tense for the Russian while the German knows they must push forward.  The key to the game is to capture assets to keep the Russian Generals off the board.  If you don't get to 18 you are going to suffer badly as the German.   Lots of fun and will play anytime.  Key items, 1) Russian overruns for 2 MP in snow, 2) 3 MP units can't leave zoc unless Russian in winter when cost is 2 mp 3) overruns get dicey as they give you  1 meaning a result of "7" is loss for both sides 4) Russian leaders are brutal they turn a 1 to 2 attack into a winning situation for the Russian 4) breaking down Germans for speed is critical.

I thought with the low density counter mix and huge map that the game would be boring, but it is surprisingly interesting treatment of the war in Russia during World War Two. The surprise elemnt makes the game very playable on a solitaire level, while the simple rules make it easy to teach to your fellow gamers. The components are top notch, as usual, from MMP, which understands the importance of making counters attractive but easy to read and understand. The map has your basic terrain and is beuatiful, although it is quite huge and if playing the campaign game an unusual footrpint. The game will take some time to setup as units are placed in specific hexes. Unique system, which is different than other games on the Eastern Front.

The more I play the less I like.Its boring, for the Russian player mainly, he has nothing to do, he just get punched by the German for most of the time.The combat table are such that u always have no hope of resisting and the german is always sure that he will take no losses the maximum risk he will have is that he has to retreat one or two hexes.The Finnish part of the map is more or less useless, its seems a separete game.The Russian get isolated and attacked, always, the german moves his panzer last and will get around your units isolate an army and u will get to roll at the beginning of the next turn for OOS...and u will be halved for combat with no possibility to retreat (OOS army cannot retreat in Zoc) or move (u cannot disengage if u are in zoc af any german unit) normally the only way to retreat if u are not OOS is to attack on unfavorable odd and hope for a A2 result so that u can retreat (for what reason i can retreat if im in total chaos after a battle but cant retreat while im in goos order in zoc of a 233 Rumanian unit i cannot explain) ;-)Ill give it another try but this time I want to play the German so my adversary can finally understand why i think that the game is a solitary game.jmtc

Some have criticised the map but I like it. I did find the Finland map pointless and I do not bother with it.

Pluses include well-written rules suitable even for novices, minimal errata (so far), wonderful player's aids, supports 1-4 players easily,  contains six scenarios of varying lengths, unique and innovative mechanics galore, great graphics, as well as beautiful map and counters. 

A few minor aspects trouble me: the map is huge and will have to be played on more than one table (although I do like the map add-ons), the counters use symbolic conventions with which I'm unfamiliar, and the game runs only to March/April 1944 truncating the war so there's no Soviet invasion of the Nazi Homeland.

Having only puttered around with the intro scenario, I'm by no means a well-informed player. However, some truly innovative mechanics are involved in this game. I guess first is the way that untried Soviet armies and pulling units off the line for rest and refit is effortlessly simulated by three grades of combat chits. It took me quite a few readings of the rule book to finally understand that Axis forces never get replacements, only reinforcements (i.e., every hit the Axis takes is permanently gone). Finally, the turn sequence is unique -- instead of "Axis does stuff then Soviets do the same stuff" style of individual player turns, RSR has a turn sequence which is structured to reflect the differing qualities of the opposing forces. For instance, only the Axis player gets a "mechanized movement phase" and that happens after the Soviets move! Wow!

I was wondering if you are going to design an attachable map that perhaps covers Eastern Europe at least as far as Berlin, as well as any additional counters or rules needed.  I am not saying that without this the game is lacking, I just like the idea of the Germans being in the same situation as the Russians were at the start of the war.  Moreover,it provides some more interesting play as the Russians are allowed to enjoy the opportunity of using their massive army to the fullest in the allout drive for Berlin.  I do think the game is really great.

Hmm...Victory in the West system, with strength chits.  I have Iron Tide and played it but was not very impressed.  Mainly because of the huge no. of counters required by this system where strength of a unit is determined by a draw and a chit.  I can see where it is all about but I also think if it matters a lot to have uncertainty in a unit's strength given the overall simulation level and other techniques available. But the scope of this game is too grand to resist...entire eastern front from the beginning to the end!

Beatiful game about the russian campaign 1941-1944. Not the Germans nor even the Soviets knows the power of the Soviet armies until an attack is occurring. The Germans can deploy down their units, or reassemble them in larger units with more firepower but less speed to run. And they must be aware of their supply, because every hex they penetrate in the extense Soviet territory looking for the red pipelines or industries means a longer supply line, a more easy objective to the Russians (Army or Partisans). And be also aware because the Soviets will have better units when time goes on.
I only miss the game doesn't covers until 1945.

Very good quality components and colour. Not too thrilled with the Finnish map as MMP assumes 1) everyone has a table long enough (6' feet) AND  2) players will always be facing each other. The on-map at-start listings for Soviets & Axis forces found on this map face away from each other: when on one side of the map, the opponent's listing is inverted. *Sigh* The Finnish front will not see any action in my small home.

Game is definitely a large improvement over the original Rampart version. Initial playthrough of Barbarossa is great fun for Axis (expected), a ittle tense for the Soviets. Definitely a keeper though ! Oh and there are 797 counters used...43 are coloured blanks...

Upped my rating to 9 after repeated play: this game absolutely delivers - and the subtleties within the combat system/DRM's/supply are fantastic. You REALLY enjoy playing the Soviets in winter !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Red Star Rising is build around a simple, smart and efficient engine (Production values, turn track, weather, supply, movement and combat rules) and it is able to achieve a level of simulation that other more complex games struggle to achieve! The system is so clean that it allows anyone to easily tweak it to suit his own point of view on the eastern front. For this feat alone, the game should be commended, not discredited! 

After a hundred hours of play, I believe it is very difficult to assess the game balance and the way strength markers come out is certainly no stranger to that. It is true that experience greatly improves the Axis play effectiveness, but he still has a lot to do: Manage his supply network correctly, destroy enough Soviet Economic Assets within the time frame imposed by the Production Values of the Turn Track and conquer terrain while destroying Soviet units at a steady rate without too many losses: Not an easy task! [If you consider the Axis is too strong, there are many house rules around here to try!] 

On the other hand, the Soviet player is far from helpless: He learns when and where to sacrifice units, delay the Axis or stay to the death. He also learns how to maneuver with low odds attacks and to swap units in winter to recover his armies at full strength for free! At last, he learns how to take advantage of the Axis supply network weaknesses and send his Partisans, Guards Cavalry and Airborne units to disrupt Axis supply… He can really screw Axis plans!

It took me quite some time to become aware of the many subtleties of the design and I suggest those who have played just a few hours to check the way they played (it is very easy to overlook a detail which has big consequences) and to try a complete campaign game! 

This game is, IMHO, very close to being the perfect East Front game: It allows you to reproduce the ebb and flow of the historical campaign as well as what would have happened if different decisions had been made!

Hats off to Masahiro Yamazaki!
Thank you to Adam Starkweather for having brought this game to us and for his great support!

I cannot give a 10 because the game stops in spring 1944, even though I am perfectly aware that it would have required important changes in the design to go beyond that...

This comment concerns the official 2008 living rules, NOT the unofficial rules change which I do not recommend!

A decent WWII Eastern Front war game.  I would argue that the Russian player has chances to launch localized spoiling attacks here and there and through creative play can orderly withdraw, picking off German units that advance too far.  Typical though as the Germans get stretched out and weaker as the war progresses and the Russians get stronger.

One of the best strategic games you can ever play. A remake of the Six Angles "War of the Motherland" with a much better design in mind. One of the best maps ever (why not all the publishers learn from this kind of superb maps?). Easy to learn fast to play, thousands of fun. Great strategic problems to face both from German and Russians. Wanna face them? If you love WWII eastern front simmulations, this is your game. The best on the topic since The Russian Campaign was released. Just one drawback (just to say something): it is necessary a huge table to play it. It is not a conventional size map. If you have no room, just try the Vassal version. Fantastic. Do not miss this one in your collection.

Playing now and so far it is a very interesting design.  The low level of complexity and size make it a nice multi-player game.  System is a little quirky but it is very good quirk.

The components look great -- like A Victory Lost -- but I fear it's too much of a monster in terms of map size and number of counters.

I want to rate this game higher, and perhaps after another couple of plays I will, but there are some features of the game that reduced my rating. Mostly they are as follows.

1 - The map. At first glance it looks lovely, but it's way too dark when in use. The distinction between Minor Cities, Swamp and Forest can be very hard if a space is occupied.

2 - Setup. What a pain it is to set up any of the main scenarios. The historical designations on the counters are a nice touch, until you realize they force you to sort the counters twice. Once to put them on the  army display - then again on the map. Even putting them on the map is a pain as they aren't in any obvious order - you'll find yourself placing a unit next to Leningrad one moment only for the next one to be in Lvov.

3 - Overruns. It costs three to overrun (2 for the Soviets in Winter) regardless of actual cost to enter the hex you are conducting the overrun  (including ZOC's).  This means that overruns often speed units up if there are other enemy units in the vicinty, but not when there aren't - this does not feel right at all. I know other games often have the same problem, but a simple rule that said the cost of the overrun was either 3 or the cost to enter the hex being overrun would have got around this (subject to 1 hex move rule). 

4 - Scenarios. 5 that start in June 41 and one small one. Would like to have seen some shorter ones 42-43, 43-44 for example.

5 - Balance. Can the Axis win the Barbie scenario? It doesn't look even remotely possible to me. 

I've increased my rating after another play. Point 4 above isn't an issue. There aren't any spaces into which you can overrun which would cost more than 3 mp to move into.

Provisional rating.

A large, low-medium complexity game.  Finland map seems redundant.  Excellent Vassal module.

A so so game. However,the combat system is well done alone I would give it high marks in the way it is designed dealing with German tank ability to move through contested zones and the Soviet winter advantage plus leaders. The Germans can negate this by moving out of the Soviet contested zone (ZOC). However this was changed later in the living rules where they changed the turn sequence for winter turns so the Soviets moved before they attacked. This to me just shows a hole in the design. I did not like how dark the map was and the coloring of the map. The counters seemed a bit thin(seemed cheap). I disliked the way depots had to be used in the German supply system and the other nationalities had a HQ based system. Even the minor axis allies had that suppy system, Why? The German supply depots could have a line going down railroad line A, place a depot within 4 spaces of depot on line A and then have a line going a distance on rail line B. It did not seem realistic to me. Why during mud turns one could move them big distances? I also did not like the partisan rules in the way they could place a whole front out of supply by being on a rail line. I have not read about the subject but I base this on the play of other east front games like Fire in the East. I thought it odd the Germans did not get replacements, where the vast majority of East Front do give replacements and renforcements. The "Tar Baby" like ZOC did not seem right to me for cetain nationalties, where they could not move out. It is odd there are no type of fortifications that can be built like other east front games. What no forts? I like FitE and War Without Mercy better. Some things right but too many wrongs for me.
I have based my rating on playing TP, Barbarossa, and 40 turn War for the Heartland scenario.

First impressions are very good. Interesting system with at few quirks that I am not used to. The advance and retreat rules are somewhat unusual but I like them very much. I also like the simple but interesting handling of USSR strategic resources. Highly recommended

RATING: 8.5
Interesting game with some good idea, maybe one of the best strategical game on Russian front, play flows very well.

Speed of supply depot is a tragedy but shows well how much difficult is to have you mechanized units too far from your rear.

Errata on low minimum odds to make an attack are a good addiction to a great game.

RSR has some very interesting concepts in its design, like the Russian strength chits and the the unusual sequence of play.  I recently played as Soviet by vassal and was defeated, my biggest mistake was not counter-attacking viciously during the first winter.  The Russian has to attack often to retain his freedom of movement in this game.

I'd stick with the original Japanese edition if you can get it. The Japanese grpahics are superior IMHO.

Excellent game - though marred by the un-checked German "ooze" ability (which is also in the Japanese version). No one has yet come up with a good counter to the ooze problem, I think it could be done if someone tried.....

Some good ideas over at CSW for the game.

Based on one trial game June 41 - Dec 41.
I usually don't like the International Game Series but this really good! Unlike A Victory Lost or Fire in the Sky for example, this was a real wargame (not an abstracct exercise). A lot of great mechanics that not only felt good, they also provided historical flavour. It all felt realistic without being cumbersome. I look forward to playing the entire campaign!

Many good things in this game but the campaign victory condition is why I've scored it so low - if someone (or maybe me) could come up with more appropriate victory conditions then I would re-score it.

My problem with the campain victory conditions is as follows:

Historically Germans were forced to hold land as long as possible, if the game doesn't include this element then it's just too far from history for my liking. In this game victory is determined at the end of the game by how many cities the germans hold and more importantly the strength of their army. So if you mangaged to grab Stalingrad (to destroy the resource units there)you would not even consider trying to hold on to it for a single game turn once you realised that it would be impossibly to hold it to the end and it would costs you strength steps. The germans have to conserve strength steps as they add to the victory point tally.

IMO All east fromt game needs a mechanism to force the Germans into desprate defensive battles.

Played introductory scenario and operation Barbarossa. It took a while, and I wonder whether it will get back on the table, but I hope so.

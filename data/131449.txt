RATING: 6
1 play / 5 players (2-2.5h)

LIKE: Tight economics and combo building. Very interactive and some turns were very tense when trying to complete a strategy. I enjoyed the "push your luck" era end mechanism (not as fiddly as some say).

DISLIKE: Very dry. Probably the driest game I own. The captain cards were swingy, and randomly drawing the ones that worked together leads to a significant advantage. We also played with open points, rather than hidden points.

OVERALL: I enjoyed this game, but it needs house-rules. It was tense and required some strategic thinking. Money didn't seem that tight with 5 players, perhaps because eras felt short. Our group seemed to get involved in everything, keeping the economy going. No "0 price" underselling towards the end, perhaps because having the most money was a big point swing.

My biggest complaint were the captain cards: too swingy. I feel you shouldn't be allowed to draw any more after the beginning, or allow a face-up draft. For a game of information, springing a big game-end point swing is a bit strange.

This is a neat economic game about gaining market shares of different commodities.  You want to price your goods low because other players have to buy from the lowest costs first, and every time you sell, you increase your market share.  But you need money, especially in the beginning, so you need to charge enough to keep your industry going.  However, if you've made a little nest egg you might want to come in and just give commodities away in order to force your competitors out of business (think Amazon pricing). In the end, you want to control the markets.  The character variability nudges you into one strategy over another.  

I would rate this higher, but if games are on the weighty/lengthy side, like this one, I prefer it play well with 2 so my wife and I can play together, and this one does not play 2.  It is a solid game otherwise.

Captains of Industry presents players with a rich blend of market manipulation and real estate domination while providing multiple paths to victory. Players build factories, produce goods, set prices, and then invest in real estate that will create demand for those very resources. Keller's design displays a remarkable insight into market forces and how industrial giants shape the world in order to amass personal wealth and power.

A 6 with room to grow. Turn order is a BIG DEAL, but there are ways to affect this. Remain to be seen whether that becomes too important, and whether the Captain cards are too swingy.

Regardless of the final outcome, Keller has produced two solid titles in a row. He has a great eye for how to create intertwined incentives in a compellingly elegant economic system.

For starters the rulebook is horrible... We had to puzzle through out first play through and it was aggravating at some points. All that said though it provides a fairly interesting and unique game. As a group we enjoyed it and look forward to trying it again. I highly recommend printing out the player aids that are hosted on this sight, especially for the advancement tracks.

Much Much better when played using the correct rules.

Captains of Industry is soooo close to being awesome, but ultimately suffers from the same problem nearly every other "players set the market prices" games have, and that is that undercutting runs rampant, and is illogically effective (what business in real life can be the most successful by continually selling things for $0 profit?).

In this game, the problem was made doubly bad by introducing an area majority mechanic, where the most sales to the bank at the end of an age is worth bonus points, and any unsold goods are simply lost.  The bank will always buy the cheapest available goods until the bank's demand is fulfilled.  So, when it looks like an age may be ending, players are highly encouraged to just tank the prices, especially those going early in turn order who fear getting undercut by players going after them.

The problem is made triply bad by having a couple actions that allow players to change the prices of ALL their goods!  So, it's super easy to suddenly undercut everyone, meaning the early people in turn order have to price at the lowest price possible, as losing out on the end of age sales can mean massive swings in points.  You'd rather sell the goods at $0 than not sell them at all, since selling them scores you points, so down to $0 the prices go to avoid getting dicked over.  The whole positioning for these end of age sales and bonuses is incredibly odd and unfun.  There's also enough money in the game where this tactic isn't really punished, either.  Players sold a ton of goods for $0 just to ensure points while also boning other players in the process, and still had no money shortage.  I was the one doing this repeatedly, and won the game doing it, and it just felt incredibly weird that selling things for no profit was a solid strategy.

There are at least a few markets where this isn't an issue, as pricing a good at $0 just means people later in turn order are going to gobble up those free resources to build other stuff.  However, most of the markets in the game can't be bought from by other players, and the bank is the only one able to buy from those markets, making the undercutting practice a pretty big problem with game play.

There's a lot of great stuff here, as everything in the game interacts in pretty interesting ways, but the pricing system, and more specifically the whole area majority part of the game that leads to ridiculous, point rich posturing maneuvers at the end of the age absolutely killed the game.  Until seeing the way ends of ages were playing out, I was ready to rate the game an 8, but I just see it as a really big problem that sucked the life out.

Tough game to rate without a lot of plays. It has a very interesting market system that is completely player driven. I don't love that you can draw new end-game cards as those draws can always be luck-filled. And it is tough to feel good about the luck in when the round ends, as that makes for HUGE differences in outcome. But overall some interesting decisions to make.

My first economic game and it proved to be pretty fun. There is definitely a lot going on in terms of setting the market and choosing which facilities and goals to go for. Component quality is decent and artwork is okay. Tech tree needed to be bigger or game needed some player aids. The variable end is both a cool concept but the implementation of it can result in some extremely long games with some unlucky shuffling.

Ok game.  Felt very tit for tat with the price wars.  Also going 4th in a 3er game felt like a big disadvantage.  The 3 free double facilities seem like auto turn 1 moves.  The 4th (and 5th) player gets scraps.  Lots of price screwage in end of age.   Most money is huge points...feels like too big a swing.  I'd play again but wouldn't suggest it.

Captains of Industry was a hit with my group and rivaled for “best new to me of 2015”; I liked it that much. This is a truly interactive economic game where you must constantly assess and react to the table. I find it anything but “dry” due to the tension of not knowing who’s going to undercut you if you do something.

See, you all build factories and produce goods with the catch that players must purchase the lowest priced good on offer. That is, if you and another player have wood for sale but their wood is cheaper than yours, you still have to purchase theirs and not yours (which would be free). Furthermore, at the end of a round the game will purchase a certain amount of goods via that same process.

And here’s an aspect I just love: that “certain amount of goods” is affected by how much demand players create. In addition to building factories and making goods, you also put real estate on the board which create demand for different goods. Whereas some games may allow you to crank out a bunch of stone and be the Stone King, here you need to create both ends, supply and demand. One without the other is not enough, and while you might spend efforts creating a lot of demand, other players may see what you’re up to and move into “your” territory. In this way, the game is highly interactive and reactive and more than just mere number crunching and resource optimization. 

So, ideally you want to have a lot of goods on offer and a big demand for them. Arranging that situation without other players swooping in to leech off your efforts is the ostensible fun of the game. There’s room for doing a lot of one good, a little of every good, and for going heavy into research (which players need to go up the tech tree). The tech tree rewards production, research, and real estate strategies.

After several plays, my group has deemed the captain cards the biggest weakness of the game. These are end of game bonus cards that you get at game start and can also draw during the game. We tried a few variations – dealing X extra and then returning X, drafting, etc. and I can’t say we found something we’re totally happy with. A fortuitous combination of these can be game breakers.

The research board is way too small unless only two players.  Apart from that it's a good game and the rules are pretty clear.
It's a shame the captains themselves could not have shown pictures of the actual men quoted or those relevant.

Played a few now, and Im not as enthusiastic as I was seems to get very slow and clunky.  Is that just the way we played it?

RATING: 6
A game with some interesting mechanics that works quite well together to make a quite good game, but it has quite a lot of flaws and does not feel well produced. 
+ Ok amount of available actions, that you learn pretty quickly. 
+ Much interaction with markets and buying from other players. 
+ Good balance with materials and demand for them. Some great combos to be made. 
+ Buying residents to trigger more demand in sectors is a nice concept that works well. 
+ Storing VP in hidden chest gives some extra satisfaction somehow
- Production quality is not great and not consistent. Some components nice most not so nice. 
- Too random and variable play length. That also impact who wins way too much. It matters a lot if there is only one or five more rounds and you can end up wasting rounds producing things that will just be thrown away.  
- Can feel like you are stuck doing the same action over and over again. 
- Not very much feeling of a theme.
- Captain cards all look the same and does not give a lot of theme to the game.
- No player aids
- No scoring card
- Rules are not clear on some finer points and the rulebook does not give a good overview of the game or make it easier to explain the game.

Cut throat economic game. You absolutely have to synergize what you are buying for your engine to work. But you can't rely on the pieces of your strategy being there as markets are often empty (at least in the game I played), and other players can beat you to what you need. 
Not sure about this one.

Yes, no, maybe... I don't know. Can you repeat the question?

It has everything that I should like. Yet ultimately it all feels a bit like an area control game, when it had all the potential to be a really great economic game.

That said it does offer multiple paths to victory and there is a lot to love.

Next time I'd like to try investing in research.

I'm not exactly objective on this, as I've been a playtester for this game for many years. But I think it's a really interesting one. It's a market-manipulation game about setting the prices of goods and reading the market as a whole. Games like this can sometimes be fragile, but Captains of Industry isn't.  There is a lot going on with all the different markets; it's important (and not always easy) to find a niche.  Very good heavy-ish economic game.

Decent, but this game should be much better than it is.  Players just tank their Durable and Energy goods to $0 at the end of an age, causing everyone else to do the same.  Also, the random age ending mechanic is quite annoying.

Juego ecónomico en el que los jugadores producen una serie de bienes y los vuelcan a un mercado común, pudiendo establecer el precio de sus bienes. Recuerda vagamente al Arkwright

Además de las acciones relacionadas con la producción, compra de fábricas y venta al mercado, se puede ir "construyendo" diferentes "areas de una ciudad ficticia" que marcarán un poco la demanda al final de la cada una de las eras/rondas/momentos de puntuación. También existe la posibilidad de invertir tus turnos en desarrollar una especie de árbol de habilidades/tecnologías que potencian el resto de tus acciones o te dan puntos al final de la partida.

A destacar, más alla de que se trata de un juego económico duro (molan), interesante me parece que a la hora de construir fabricas o comprar desarrollos o desarrollar la ciudad debes comprar los materiales del mercado, y además estás obligado a comprar el de menor valor (lo cual dará puntos y dinero a otros jugadores)

Además hay una especie de cartas, los magnates, que dan puntos al final de la partida.

Played a very early prototype about ten times for consideration for another publisher about 5 years ago.  So please understand this when you read my comments.  This game was a massive flop with my group who frequently were used to test prototypes for several game companies.  

This game was dry, boring, and had some serious manipulation problems where I was able to win with some very curious strategies.  I am sure things have changed since this beta but out of the ten people that play tested this game with me, I was the only one who even remotely thought it had potential. Most everyone else hated the game.  Lets hope the designer made some improvements and significant changes to a game that truly was a cube pusher. 

As a side note, we frequently joked the yellow beakers were full of urine from piss tests. Apparently, those beakers were kept to represent R&D maybe?

Sold my copy. Decided in the end that I'd rather just play Container. I know the two games are different, but Container fills the same space in my collection. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Excellent first impression of this one and this could end up being my first TMG keeper.  There is interesting interplay between pricing items dependent upon fighting for majority scoring at the end of an age or keeping prices low to gain market share (point) more easily.  Going late in turn order can definitely be an advantage late in an age to react to others in reacting to demand from the neighborhood real estate (which is another dynamic to be considered as this drives what market share scoring at the end of each age).  Similar to Container, each item price is set by the producer so games could play quite differently dependent upon group think.  Unlike Container, there is no death spiral as there is no limit to production of goods.  Research tracks are present to enhance actions and provide additional scoring as well as Captain of Industry cards which provide end game scoring for different factors (one starts with four but will discard three during the game - there is an action which lets you draw one and change market prices as well).  The uncertain end of an age mechanic is well implemented as well.  

In short, there is a fair bit of moving parts and interactions in the game that may not be obvious initially.  Several plays will likely be required to grasp how to play well and the different strategies that will work best.

A very solid economic game where you are producing goods and setting prices in the marketplace.  Other players and you can buy the cheapest good from a market.  You can also buy real-estate and it changes demand for goods and services.  There is end of age score where you get victory points.  I really enjoy the end of age mechanism where the more real estate purchased the more cards are drawn and the age may or may not end depending on which cards come out.  You also have cards that give bonuses at the end of the game.  

I find economic games very interesting and this is a good one. My sole complaint that makes this less than excellent is that you need some player aids and there are not enough VP tokens.  You have to use money to account for VP's as you get into the 2nd and 3rd age.  

It is a heavy economic game but well designed.  When played with a group that has multiple plays, it has layers of strategy.

Captains of Industry is a heavy economic game that allows you to buy and sell goods from others players at prices you determine.  I think this game works better than others in the category, including Wealth of Nations and Container.  The game strongly incentives players to produce goods that there's a lack of, and the addition of the game buying goods at the end of each round keeps the game moving at a good pace and provides a production target.  Turns are pretty atomic, so you're never sitting around waiting for someone to do something complicated, but you're always doing something significant.  The whole package is very well put together, plus it has some amazing art.

CoI is an economic game about producing goods, price-setting, and making money. Players buy factories of different types to produce goods. At the time the goods are produced, a player sets the price for that good. For example, I might have a lumber mill. When I produce lumber, I put it into a supply on the board and mark the price. If there is no other lumber, great! Anyone who wants to use it (e.g., to build more factories) will be forced to pay that price. But if another person supplies more lumber and sets the price lower, I’m in trouble. Players must always buy the cheapest product available. Additionally, at the end of each round, the game buys a certain amount of products. Players have some control over how much of each resource is purchased by the game, but doing so requires additional investments. Furthermore, the end of the round is determined by a randomization method (which, incidentally, drove me mad at first, but I ended up enjoying it) so players have to be wary of overproducing goods or being undercut by others. All in all, I found the systems pretty fascinating and I want to get this one back to the table.

Another surprise hit of the month. Nearly my favorite even. This came as a huge shocker because I wasn't really expecting much. This game is economic, city building, tech research. It has a lot of great things working together. I wonder why it wasn't more of a success. I think it got missed along the way when it was released. Lack of art maybe? Some commented that it wasn't very pretty or looked to have no theme. Those comments were from the outside. I am here to say I felt a lot of theme when playing, even if the board is very abstract. I really felt as if I was city building! Supply and demand this game is just awesome! Everything you do in this game is critical and timing is everything. I loved it. I can't wait to play it again!

Only had a chance to play this once, but it really fell flat for me. The resource market, techs, and buildings don't feel much like an industry - more like a weird industrial flea market where wood leads to oil leads to gears because of course it does. The boroughs or neighborhoods or whatever were an extremely dry, abstracted little corner of scoring that were way more important than they were fun to focus on. And the end scoring cards weren't particularly helpful as guides, as your hand is ever-changing, randomly drawn, and potentially non-existent.
Despite all that, I had fun manipulating the various markets and trying to carve out a little money-making niche among the other players' strategies.

Captains of Industry is an economic simulation game where the players compete in different markets. It works, and the action is extremely player driven, but I don't find the game particularly compelling.

There is a game in here. And hard to rate it after first play. Specially with so much of the game is player driven and group think. But two things bugged me which is the random aspect of captain card and length of the round. I understand that you should probably pick up few cards early on to formulate your strategy around it but uneven length of round and how valuable each action seems in the beginning that this was difficult to achieve. Then it gives big advantages on the synergy of the initial 4 cards to hopefully work together. Wonder drafting the four starting hand be better here?

2 plays (3er, 4er), once with the correct rules!

A pretty interesting, purely economic game, although it is kind of dry. 

Players build/expand factories, and run them to produce various things (and price them as you like). If building, you buy the required materials from other players as necessary -- which earns them VP. You can also buy a research advance (using knowledge), which give you in-game or end-game bonuses (e.g., earn extra VP when another player buys your good, get a discount on some actions, earn VP at the end of each Age, etc.). You can also use materials to build real estate, which gives you additional income after each round and also modifies the End-of-Age bank demand for the various resources (score VP for sales of your resources, and also for majorities in resources on 3 areas of the board). Finally, there are Captain Cards, which give you end-of-game VP for meeting a variety of conditions.

It works well, but better with more players. There are tough decisions to make all along. It just wasn't as enjoyable as I'd hoped! Maybe with a better theme?

Players build facilities to produce goods, sold at a price they choose; other players must always buy at the lowest available price. Each good sold is 1VP, so there is a balance to strike between points and cashflow (or high prices to save the goods for yourself). At the end of each of the three ages, goods are also sold to the wider market based on demand that players themselves have created by building real estate.

Research goods can be spent on game-breaking advances and additional scoring is provided through cards representing the titular captains of industry, each of which which provides a goal: additional points for diversified production, undiversified production, building real estate of a specific type etc.

I love this genre of player-driven economic games, perhaps best embodied by the wonderful Container. Captains of Industry does, unfortunately, suffer by that inevitable comparison. Container's smaller number of goods and limitations on production force competition, for example; I have some qualms that the changes in Captains, combined with a very real shortage of actions, will tend to lead to natural monopolies. Once a player has a facility of a certain size they are unlikely to attract new competitors. Groupthink is of course a factor, and my fear isn't that the goods economy doesn't work -- part of the game's charm is that these incentives change significantly with player-generated demand -- but that the action restrictions impose the wrong incentives on it.

It would certainly be worth exploring this more if not for the fatal flaw, its random elements. The semi-random timing of age end can cause unjustifiably huge swings in sector domination, which is frustrating even if arguably thematic. But the insurmountable problem is the captain deck: even if one accepts the dubious supposition of balanced scoring potential it is clear that combinations range from perfectly synergistic to mutually exclusive. A late game card draw could be worth 15 points or 0 and this is unacceptably lumpy.

It's a shame, because there are some interesting ideas there.

Additional superficial complaints are that the rules are neither clear nor complete, graphic design seems very cheaply done (even worse than Mayfair, zing) and, annoyingly, there's a good chance of running out of tokens and/or money.

Some interesting and elegant system elements, plus excellent artwork, all contribute to an intriguing gaming experience. 

This is a serious design, certain mistakes (e.g., pricing wrong) can just kill you (as can ignoring sector domination).

The variable Progress deck has taken a lot of criticism, but I thought it was an elegant solution to prevent players from pegging an end of Age with absolute certainty.

Our second play really turned the tide for me, this is an excellent game.

tl;dr: fine but could have been better

Economic resource generation and free market game. It has some elements from [thing=26990]one of my favorite economic games[/thing]. The base mechanism is very solid. Manage your money, make sure you produce the right amount of the right resources at the right time, don't overspend on resources from other players... Good stuff but nothing really new.
The game takes 3 rounds but the length of the rounds is not fixed. While we all liked the game quite a bit most players did feel like the variable round length was slightly problematic. The second round was very short (which was fine) but the last round took very, very long. This resulted in most players being more or less done rounds before the game was over. Left with little to do and score, some of us basically had to sit it out, going through the motions. That certainly could have been improved upon.

Here we have an economic game that has a welcome dose of player interdependency. The mechanics are sufficiently (and skillfully) woven together so as to create exploitative relationships between the players. You must sell your goods to other players to win the game, and yet you will also have to purchase from those same players in order to make your economic engine run. In many ways, this game feels similar to Container, but less fragile (which to me is a negative, but not damningly so).

I do have one concern after a single play -- namely, that the round structure is repetitive, especially the third and final round. In the first round, you are establishing a strategy, and in the second you are carrying out that strategy. By the time the third round arrives, it seems like more of the same. Other games with this problem include El Grande and Sunrise City. Where is the larger narrative arc? -- or are we merely playing three rounds of the same thing? If the latter, then why isn't some new wrinkle introduced? What is the point of the round structure? All that said, perhaps repeat plays will alleviate this concern. And regardless, there is certainly enough here to recommend Captains despite its possible flaw.

Most economic engine games can be too crunchy for my tastes. And if you like crunching numbers you can crunch away all you want in this game. But if you are like me, fun factor is the #1 factor; and this game has it in spades. There are so many ways to play. Even when my "so called" strategies failed, I still had fun playing and having an impact on the final outcome.

Straightforward Container-like game though with more types of goods. Players buy from each other (to get what they need to expand production, or do research, or buy "real estate" i.e. create demand on the part of the bank) and try to sell also to the bank. Buying at the best price is mandatory. Considerable bonus points are won via majority games of who produced the most goods that the public/bank actually bought.

There are end-of-game goal cards that you can spend a turn to draw and that the game makes you gradually give back (meaning if you never draw you'll eventually have none). I saw some use here in giving the game initial direction, but in general the game seems like it directs itself fairly well. So I'm not wild about these cards, the time spent thinking about them, or the randomness when drawing them. They are easily removed from the game I suppose.

Research (on a tech track) grants special powers to keep in mind; I'm not too fond of this either, but removing it would undermine the primary purpose of one of the markets. (I also think the advances are not very clearly defined, and the manual doesn't discuss many of them.)

...Once the game gets going, with enough people acting in each industry, this game is pretty fun. All moves are mechanically pretty simple, without being micro-moves that just step you towards a goal without themselves being an accomplishment. There is a strong sense of being an actor in a supply/demand economy, as well as having a decent idea of what's going on in that economy. (Seems less opaque than Container.)

There's also actually a bit of a "just one more turn" feeling: There are typically, at one time, multiple reasonable and non-mutually-exclusive things to do; choosing one move usually leaves a laundry list of loose ends that I'm eager to tackle on my next turn. Like good games like Through the Ages the prioritization considerations are interesting due to uncertainty of how long conditions will persist (unpredictable end of round, etc.).

Speaking of end of round, I like how you sort of know when the end of age will come, but you're never sure. In the extreme case the last player may be 80% sure that his move is the last of the age.

There has been criticism that several factors produce a wonky dynamic that undermines the supply/demand game. Namely, that market control (selling the most) is particularly rewarded; that goods production itself is free; and that unsold goods are simply lost at end of age. So there is a willingness to offer goods (especially the ones that players don't themselves buy) to the public for free. I think this is definitely a thing that happens, except in markets where one player does not yet have competition. I'm not sure how damaging it is. Money does seem rather loose in this game.

Another odd thing... There is a great tech tree advance available right away that gives you $5 off overtime production. But some industries only cost $5 to work overtime in the first place... So the "overtime or no" decision disappears.

(After 1 4p game) - FIRST IMPRESSION:  Some are calling this Container 2.0 and I can see that, but money seemed to flow much more freely in our game.

Players setting market prices, developing goods, buying real estate, players setting demands, lots of VP opportunities and lots of moving parts.    

Might need another play to see more of the impact of the moving parts and the importance of acting last (1st to buy real estate on previous round).  In my one play we seemed to all buy RE on the same round where I could see the benefit of speeding the game along by buying in separate rounds.

Would play again.

Note: .5 score deducted for component issues. The 5 player game had us running out of MS and x5 MS for 2-3 players. 

I liked this game quite a bit w/ one play. I had been interested in an economic game where the players are consuming each other's goods, and I found it! My only complaints with the game are that it maybe isn't designed to support 5 players like the box claims. The game itself fall apart a bit in the last age and after all the real estate was purchased, the game was dragging. We had to basically call the last round arbitrarily since we had been playing for almost 3.5 hours at that point. 

The actual gameplay was fun and all 5 players seemed to enjoy it though!

I really liked this game. Closed economy game. People buy from each other, and the game also buys from players. Quick number crunchy; but I felt it kept things very balanced.

Still don't understand the real estate cards and why its not clear what the bronze, silver and gold cards nor why I can't choose which one I want.  Also the captain cards I find hard to understand as they relate to specific color real estate cards that you sometimes can't place.

Also the number of points you get can be quite high and twice we had to fish out points to exchange up.

Only issue I have is game rounds/ages can end very very quickly and there is not enough components for the number of VP you can earn.

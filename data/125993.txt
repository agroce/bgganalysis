To emulate Guderian's sickle cut my panzers need to reach Abbeville from their start point at a minimum cost  of 43 movement points.  That's OK, they have a movement allowance of seven and ten days in which to match what Guderian achieved in eight.  Oh, but Hitler's halt order may slow them to a crawl for one turn; still all right.  Oh, but there will be a substantial allied force and an attritional combat results table to slow the advance; don't be ridiculous. It remains possible for the German to win by closing allied reinforcement entry points and avoiding losses.  However, the very improbable success of the historical strategy just chafes with me. A lesser gripe is that the final turn can suffer from end of the world syndrome. The allies are suddenly freed from any need to defend territory or preserve units to go all out to get some kills.

Dynamo presents a real contrast to Sickle Cut.  While the map size is the same, the action is compressed into a small area between Bruges and Calais.  The Allies need to concentrate sufficient forces around Dunkirk to fend off the panzers, while keeping a pocket of slow-moving French troops in supply as long as possible.  For the German this scenario presents less of a strategic challenge. The goals are plain (capture Dunkirk, destroy British units) and a pincer movement north of Armentieres to separate the Brits from the main French force is an obvious thing to do.  A nice touch was to provide the units, map space and a suggested set-up to allow budding designers and history buffs to fight the earlier days of this campaign.

Production quality is to GMT's usual standard.  A mention for the graphic design of the counters, which makes a fair bit of information easily readable. The rule book is clear and well laid out.  The player aids are also good, though I would have appreciated a more detailed sequence of play.

Excellent straightforward hex-and-counters game, very  smooth.

Sickcle cut plays in a long day (perhaps 1 turn per hour) and balance is great. Very tense.

Fluid and chaotic, unit density is great, just enough chrome, a very good game.

Raised my rating after yesterday's session.

EDIT: After another game with a newbie I now feel I am done with it. After a while it becomes repetitive and boring.

NEXT EDIT: Another game of Sickle Cut. After the front is penetrated, the game becomes a racing game where units of both sides try to encircle each other, like a dance. Not sure the time/space scale works well with total knowledge of the enemy's positions, it's kinda gamey. Too long to play with about an hour per turn, this scenario takes a full day.

I played it once through solitaire.  Seemed to do a good job of teaching me what I wanted to know about the campaign, combined with reading Horne's book.  Many games on this topic suffer from balance problems or (the alternative) too much scripting.  France '40 gets around this to a certain extent by starting the battle a few days in, with the Germans having already fooled the Allies... then it is a fight for the river crossings and a race to the coast.  Not very complicated (by my standards) and just a few extra rules to simulate French command problems.

I've seen comments of significant pro-French balance on this, but I don't really get that feeling. In about 5 games we've seen 2 German wins and all but one of the games going right down to the wire; only one was a French blow-out and that was only due to the Germans making a major strategic error in the mid-game (going for southern map-edge hexes instead of pushing for the coast). No question the pressure is on the Germans and they have a tougher game to play, but I certainly have not found the balance to be problematic (yet), in that it has always produced exciting games as the Germans go for broke. But, balance on these things is always hard to tell, since we tend to play in small groups with small sample sizes. I have heard that there are some minor balance tweaks coming down the pike.

Update: Finally sold on Ebay for $20.

Update: Tried to sell on Ebay again, again no bids at $30 - for an out of print GMT game (2 games actually) by a popular designer.  

Update: Tried to sell on Ebay, didn't get any bids.  Guess this game is about as unpopular as Caucasus Campaign, which I managed to sell, but only at a low price.

Update: Played 3 games of Sickle Cut: one solitaire, one as Germans, one as Allies.  The common themes of all 3 games were (1) The Germans can't win by driving to the Channel; the game cannot replicate history (2) the Allies are not very fun to play, even though they always win, because most of their units are disrupted or have GQG markers on them, so they can't attack, can only move 2, and often have to move away from enemy units. They also have no control over their reinforcements or where they appear, which at first seems like a fun mechanic, but combined with the Disrupted/GQG situation, means the Allies are just stumbling backwards every turn trying to recreate some kind of line while the Germans get to control all their units precisely and execute their plan, which is just a lot more fun. It's basically Barbarossa in France - no the Germans won't take Moscow/Abbeville but they will enjoy the actual moving and fighting the whole time while the Allies are just a punching bag who win on a technicality at the end.  Typically there will be 30+ dead Allied divisions in the deadpile by the end of the game but few if any Germans.

After a half play of Dynamo, I like it but don't love it. The rules are very smooth, but seem a bit bland. I tend to look for more evocative mechanisms in my gaming. Perhaps as a first time player, I wasn't able to make good use of the special things, the things that drew me to the game in the first place - zoc bonds, determined defense, and 'bouncing' advance after combat. I'd love to get in a full VASSAL play now that I've got the rules down. It would allow for a more thoughtful approach to operations to try and tease out the specialness.

RATING: 6
Very fast, playable and fun game about crucial days in 1940 campaign in France. Rules are easy to grasp, both sides have similar chance to win and tension is high.
Two scenarios: first treat about German breakthrough at Sedan and drive to the Channel (or not) and second is about operation Dynamo, which is "race against the clock" game. First scenario have high replayability due to a random Allied reinforcements. Second is a rather boring slugfest.
Usual GMT quality. Very readable counters and map.

Played one full game as the French, and I enjoyed it. There's excellent tension, as the French player will always have the feeling that things could completely collapse at any moment, and they just might. Leave it to Mark Simonitch to turn an otherwise uninteresting affair into a tight game.

The rules are familiar for anyone coming from [i]The Caucasus Campaign[/i] or [i]Ukraine 43[/i], but with twists appropriate for the situation. It's alway enjoyable to read a nice, clean, tight set of rules that actually work right after some shitty, overchromed Berg game that doesn't.

That said, I've had to suppress my rating a bit for a couple reasons. One is that I don't think, given competent French play and average luck, the German player can actually win the Sickle Cut scenario. This is, in part, due to the overly cooperative French and British forces. I also don't think it's all that fun to be the French, since you'll mostly be playing defense with the occasional counterattack here an there. The overall fluidity is much better than TCC at least.

Still, a solid game.

Think France 1940 was a one-sided cake-walk that's impossible to turn into a competitive game? Well, think again because the first (and some would say only) true blitzkrieg finally has a title  worthy of such a seminal event. In actuality the Germans only achieved their famous breakthrough after several days of hard fighting at the Meuse crossings and beyond. By zooming in on these key battles at a low operational scale (one day turns, Division and Brigade units) "France '40" will make you fight just as hard to achieve your own blitz (or desperate defence of democracy). (Interestingly, "Plan West" by Three Crowns used a similar approach to do a good job with WW II's other "ungameable" topic: Poland 1939.)

This is as good as traditional hex-wargaming gets. I have no real complaints, so this gets my first BGG "10"!

Incredibly well balanced and has great depth with a relatively straightforward set of rules (which will also be used for the reprint of Ukraine '43).  My first game of Sickle Cut was a German victory because on the last move I made a bad move with ONE counter as the French, allowing the Germans to break through my line and slip out of one of the exits.  My first game of Dynamo, I slipped the last required British unit out on the last turn.

I was looking forward to this game, but I cancelled my preorder.

I also cancelled the P500 orders I have made (a substantial number). When MMP charges for a game, the game arrives quickly. They do not charge until the product is ready.Maybe GMT could take a lesson from MMP.

Finished my first play, a solo play of Sicklecut. Allies won 11-3. This is probably my least favorite of the Mark S designs I've played. That doesn't mean it isn't a good game. I still gave it a 7.5. It is very streamlined and played fast. I think it will be a much better experience FTF. My plays of Mark's other games have all included FTF games.

Against good Allied play, I just don't see the Germans getting to Abbeville (or enough entry hexes) often.

I would guess that balancing the game would take reducing the GQG die rolls from 2 to 1 (i.e. only one goes away a turn) and reducing the Allied reinforcements by 1 each turn.
---------------------------------
Not surprising, but another polished game design by Simonitch.

By focusing in on the critical part of the campaign, France '40 is an interesting situation that provides both sides with a challenge.  

With a moderate set of rules, low counter density, and a 10-turn main scenario, this game is very playable.

The above comments apply to the Sickle Cut scenario, not so much the Dynamo scenario.  While it is cool to have both maps and a 2nd scenario, I think Dynamo ends up being far less interesting since the Allies really should not counter-attack much, and it becomes kind of a counter-stack grind as the pocket shrinks.  Probably best for solitaire only.

As others have mentioned, this game has inspired me to read more on the campaign.  The Blitzkrieg Legend, by Karl-Heinz Frieser, cited in the designer's notes as the genesis for this game, should be required reading for all WW2 history buffs.  While some of it is a little text-book dry, the events described are so extraordinary that it is still an exciting read. 

Solo Sickle Cut:  16VP Allied, 5 VP German, Germans were about 3 hexes short of Abbeville, but there was a pretty large British army in the way, and good French units in Abbeville itself, so a game extension would not have helped the Germans.  The Panzer divisions took a pretty large beating from effective French counter-attacks.

F2F Sickle Cut:  11VP German, 10VP Allied.  Germans gave up on Abbeville on Turn 7 and went for entry hexes.  There was a chance for the Channel, but below average attack results combined with fortuitous desparate defenses slowed down the panzers too much.

Solo Dynamo:  2VP Allied (3 Germans loses, 12 evacuations, but 10 British loses).  Allies made a misguided attempt to pocket two Panzer divisions that were creeping up during the halt.  While 2 German units did die, far more Allied units died because of it, and Dunkerque and The Beaches were under fire almost the entire time because there were not enough defenders to hold a solid line.

RATING: 7
Good: WWII - Operational - Easy

Plus:
-Very accessible and tried system that works perfect
-Two games in one package
-Jump in and play for wargamers; hardly chrome or exceptions in the rules but enough to make it an evocative experience.
-Great rulesset.
-Good quality components.
-Variable reinforcements contributes to replay value.

Minus:
-No possibility to start the actual day of the invasion. I can understand why this is done as it would take many additional rules to simulate the capture of Luxemburg, 2 key Belgian border towns and Eben Emael etc. for little gain.
However, there is no two map campaign game.
This is an issue for me and I really think this is a missed opportunity. The game covers Sickle Cut and Dynamo seperately so I guess it was never intended to cover the campaign but the name 'France 40' suggests otherwise.
-Great system, good situation but the forthcoming Ukraine '43 will push this straight from the table.

Perfect graphics (thanks to the best graphics designer in wargaming Rodger MacGowan), a unique game system, wonderful production values, interesting takes on different subject matters, feels realistic - everything that makes wargaming a such fantastic hobby.  I think this is the perfect wargame, and there are five of them to chose from (with one in the oven with Holland '44). Love it - love it - love it.

A rock-solid classic hex and counter wargame.  Interesting elements that capture the feel of the 1940 French campaign including French command and control problems.  For the Germans, "halt" orders can freeze slippery panzer units just as they are about to make their victory grab in the French backfield.  Both sides are well-challenged in this game (Sickle Cut):  Germans, create the breakthrough!  French, plug the gap!  Very enjoyable on a tried and true design.

This is one of the best  systems for WWII operational combat.  And it is applied to a challenging situation, the Fall of France. But surprise, the Allies are not mere punching bags in this game. They have teeth, and an unwary German player is in for a nasty surprise.  The game requires greater skill on the part of the German player to achieve anywhere near the historical rates of advance. But then again, not everyone is a natural Guderian!  (nor are we as clueless as Gamlin!) 

The 2nd Game in the box, on Dunkirk is also very good. The Germans have to race against time as the Allies escape and the German Panzers are withdrawn. But don't count the Allies out entirely, they have a bite and a counterattack can lead to a nasty surprise.

I am truly impressed with this game. The rules are streamlined compared to Ardennes '44 and the game plays really fast: Dynamo scenario takes about 3 hours, Sickle Cut around 4. Very playable. I think it will land on the table quite often.

2) the rules contain some minor mistakes and ambiguities (fixed with FAQ and Errata).

This is my third Simonitch game on the table after The Caucasus Campaign and Normandy 44. I'm already a huge fan. The game has a nice flow with some added chrome that makes for a very immersive experience of the 1940 campaign. The design is able to handle two different scenarios very well - Sickle Cut is about maneuvering with some fierce counterattacking whereas Dynamo is more of a slog. Level of complexity is a step down from N44. All in all, this is a perfect blend of simulation, game and history lesson. I can't wait to get my hands on the new edition of Ukraine '43 which will probably get the 10 rating due to it's larger scale.

RATING: 8
France '40 is actually two single-map games, Sickle Cut (Sedan to Calais) and Dynamo (i.e. Dunkirk).  While there are lots of games on the former, those are the latter are rare.  Dynamo plays well and should have some replay value despite the rather grinding nature of the battle.

The combat system is a bit more complex than most by Simonitch, with lots of emphasis on retreats and levels of advance after combat.  It plays smoothly though and feels right for the situation.  There are the usual DRMs for armor, troop quality and disruption.  The system is slick enough to let you play Dynamo in an afternoon.

The materials are typical high GMT quality.  The setup cards are a huge help as are the unobtrusive setup notations on the map.  You don't notice them in play, but they sure speed setup.

Cons:

1) There is an annoying mix of round before and after summing in these rules.  That was probably unnecessary and could be house ruled away.

2) The game could have used one more player aid card with the last few tables (e.g. evacuation and advance after combat) to save new players from thumbing through the rules till they'd memorized them.  Tables buried in the rules are a bad idea that GMT usually avoids.  I'm not sure what went wrong with their development process here.  It's minor, but with GMT minor problems are the only type you have.

Decent wargame. Counters are large and colors are bright so they are easy to read. Though, the rules could be organized better than they are. And, it especially could use a more detailed sequence of play.

Panzer Divisions are too weak on defense, they just don't have enough steps or should have an ability to retreat into EZOC's by taking a hit instead of elim. The Germans lost an entire Panzer Division in both of the two games of SC we played. And, in a Dynamo game I watched the day before two entire Panzer Divisions died and several others mauled. Seems far fetched for this Campaign. On the attack they likewise seem a bit weak too.

Also, both times we also played Sickle Cut several Allied units died due to being forced off the north edge of the map. -1 off my rating just for that. They should be able just to come back on at another Allied Entry Hex.

Also, on the plus side, it has some interesting situation maps in the back of the rules.

RATING: 8
Rating based on the Sickle Cut scenario. A France 1940 game capable of producing a reasonable representation of this key phase of the campaign without a mess of straightjacket and idiot rules. The resemblance to the history can be uncanny, especially in the first half of the game. Play aids and components are especially well presented, once the basic mechanics are absorbed you can play entirely from the physical systems.

UPDATE: I find the Dynamo scenario less satisfactory, not only because it is heavily scripted, but because the panzers will again prove decisive here, a serious distortion of the history (yes, even with the Halt orders and eventual withdrawals). Still, Sickle Cut is enough of an achievement that I can't bring myself to ding my initial rating.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have only played Sickle Cut solo twice, and both times to about halfway. The rules are fairly straightforward, but I keep forgetting small rules involved with resolving combat and advance after combat. 

From my limited experience, I'm leaning towards appreciating the design but not finding the game very engaging. I feel like there isn't enough variation for the game to play very differently once you solve the puzzle. The CRT seems fairly weighted towards the attacker because you'll almost always force the defender to make a determined defense roll even if you are disadvantaged in the battle. Sickle Cut ultimately seems to depend on whether the Germans can prevent their supply lines from being cut late in the game.

Otherwise, it's a gorgeous game with great map artwork and really nice, fairly thick 5/8 counters. The rule book is also very readable and seems to be pretty clear. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only beginning to explore the Dynamo scenario, but very impressed with Sickle Cut.  The rules are simple enough, the counter density is reasonable, and the two sides are different enough to make a compelling game.  Add wildly variable Allied reinforcements and some clever victory conditions, and you have a good bit of replayability.

Halfway through my first game, I went on eBay to see what this game was selling for. I was hoping to recoup some of my losses. By the end of the second game, I was very much impressed by both the game and the system. 

The components are top notch and errata is minimal. My only dislike is that there are several special rules to remember and my capacity to remember is greatly diminished.

If you own or have played the game and didn't like it, give it another chance. I did and I am very happy.

Excellent design. Classic, well designed and smooth playing rules, with some clever points (advance after combat, overrun). Both efficient and well fitted to this campaign. Panzer divisions are really able to penetrate deep into French front line with no special rules or system.
Components are top notch, especially the rulebook.
French army is more threatening than it had been historically, but also mess up many counter attacks due to well thought out limitations. There is both a true game here and a good history lesson.

I like the system, but after a few plays I'm not convinced the game is balanced. The scenario I played (the first one, not the Dunkirk one), seems to hinge on a few key battles. Either the germans are able to cross the river Maas early, or they lose. So it's a good system, but I'm not sure the scenarios are all that interesting. I hope Ukraine '43 or Normandy '44 will be more interesting.

Fantastic Operation Dynamo scenario.  Tense and exciting.  Dunkirk isn't easy to take for the German player and the Allies can't collapse the perimeter too quickly without giving up too much ground.  The Halt Orders are genius as you never know what panzers will move giving both players plenty of doubt with planning next moves.  A fine balancing act.  Sickle Cut involves the German effort to bust through the French lines from the Sedan to the Belgian fort of Namur.  If the Germans don't achieve a quick breakout it will be tough going for them as more French and BEF forces come into play.  The GQG command rules cripple the best French units at times.  Components are top notch.

Good but not in the same league as Ardennes '44 which is Simonitch's masterpiece imo. I didn't find it  as deep and engrossing. Still a good game that plays fast with plenty of tension. The beauty of this opus is its scope which allows it to avoid the pitfall of a scripted game by focusing on a narrower part of the campaign both geographically and timewise.

This is the third attempt by GMT to simulate the campaign.  Spending money on another turkey does not appeal to me. The comsimworld thread starts with a discussion of Rommel's division having special powers and a A Romel piece with more special powers.  That sounds like a Wizards of the Coast style game.

Do I really want to drop coin for another remake of France 40?

Same basic system as Ardennes '44, etc. Don't think it's as good as Ardenees, but still a decent game.

A nice operational level wargame. It is another classic Simonitch game, that in all truth is probably my favourite. With two simple to learn and play games in the box the only improvement to it would be the ability to link the two games together, but alas no such luck. Still very good though.

Very solid system, tight rules, excellent graphics, and tense gameplay. Takes longer to get through a turn than I anticipated, mainly because precision is important. Plays very good solo. Rating for only Operation Dynamo scenario (I haven't played Sickle Cut yet), which is absolutely terrific.

 Pourquoi ce jeu est à mon sens excellent

-Il est une mise en application de la théorie de l'Historien Karl-Heinz Frieser, le jeu part du postulat du livre et nous offre de l'explorer, les divisions blindées allemandes sont très forte, mais les divisions régulières sont lentes. 

-Le principe qui simule les carences du commandement côté français et la peur du GQG allemand sont intéressantes dans le sens où elles ralentissent les uns et les autres tout en permettant une certaine rejouabilité puisque ces pions seront tout de même placés par les joueurs et dépendront des aléas des dés.

-L'Allié a des possibilités de faire des contre-attaque, moi j'ai eu de la chance car j'ai d'abord pioché plein de pions venant du Sud, puis du Nord, ce qui m'a permis de faire des contre-attaques cohérentes, intéressant car il y a du challenge côté allié, mais là encore il va bien falloir gérer ces troupes, en fonction des aléas, mais cela permet aussi de mesurer la force du dispositif allié.

-Le jeu est par ailleurs rapide, plus que Normandy 44 du même auteur, je dirais qu'il est de la taille de Caucasus Campaign, les tours sont rapides, le premier scénario peut être fait en une grosse soirée à raison d'une demi-heure par tour de jeu

-Cependant, comme d'hab je n'ai pas pris assez de risque au début, il ne faut pas hésiter à avoir des pertes, même à 1-2, le français souffrira à terme de l'attrition, beaucoup plus que l'allemand. Il faut briser les lignes

-l'Allemand a joué de malchance au Nord et ce n'est que très tardivement qu'il a percé dans la région de Namur avec les Allemands. Là encore, une autre partie pourrait finir tout autrement en envisageant une percée dans ce secteur, même si cela semble difficile, par la conception même du jeu qui rappelle que cette partie du front est pour les Allemands une attaque de diversion.


-Un jeu qui fait la synthèse de la simulation et de la jouabilité, où l'on est finalement très loin des discours de Pétain et de Gaulle, les Alliés ont du matos et peuvent s'en servir.

Ca m'a tellement plu que j'ai fait le setup du 2e scénario, l'opération dynamo, sur lequel je reviendrai demain.

Excellent game. The French player can be active. Less scripted than most France 40 games. At last a playable and fun game on this campaign.
Sickle cut scenario victory conditions biaised in favor of the Allies. Allow 1 or 2 more turns for the German (bid for side with this bonus is best).

One play. Another excellent Mark Simonitch game.  The rulebook and system are crystal clear.  The game plays briskly with just enough chrome to give some immersion, but not so much that you can't hold it in your head over multiple sessions.  In the Sickle Cut scenario, the Germans have to push hard to get across the map in time, and the French role is mostly reactive.  The state of the board can make things look like a German blow-out, but the victory conditions allow the French to pull off some sneaky moves in the last couple turns of the game.  In particular, isolating German mechanized units on the last turn can rack up a big stack of points.  I'm looking forward to more plays both of Sickle Cut (switching sides) and Dynamo.  Initial impression is that I like this better than Caucasus Campaign (because the French here seem to have more to do than the Russians there) and about the same as Normandy '44 (which is slightly more complex and chromey, but gives a correspondingly richer experience).

France 40 is one in a line of some of the best wargames on the market. The games are all easy to play, while having a number of special rules that make them unique and a proper simulation. France 40 follows quite a scripted line of events, but does so in a way that feels exciting. At the core the game system is an old zone of control based system, with just enough advances to make combat uncertain, without being frustrating. The defenders usually have a hard time getting their line in order, while the attacker constantly searches for new holes to punch. All in all, another successful effort from one of the best contemporary wargame designers there is. A commendable effort.

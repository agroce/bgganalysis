RATING: 6.5
Very tactical game that actually gains points due to the components (and I rarely care about this), and the "theme" (which is really pretty thin).  You basically select an action, perform it and move the flock marker (pace of the game) and score if appropriate.  Sounds simple, but there are some very clever moves and some very dirty tricks you can do to other players.  Overall, a reasonably short, and very fun/dirty game for 2-4 players.

Traded for Cave Evil and Earth Reborn. 

UPDATE--It's alright, but just not really my type of game these days.

Demoed this at Origins 2007 and thought it worth spending my half-off Mayfair coupon on.  This kind of spatial reasoning game is something I'm fairly interested in, especially in non-abstract forms like Roborally.  The cute components make it easier to sell to my (mostly) non-gamer friends, as well.  [update]  Need to play this more--so far, it's just been with some non-gamers, who liked it enough.

The components are really cute! But it's an abstract game under the cutie coat and my first game (3 players) costed me 2 hours! (if it's really the 45 mins as indicated outside the game box, my rating would be 8!)
So, save it for wife or girlfriend but never any serious players!

I enjoyed this game, but it's a little deeper than the cute sheep would imply, but yet there's more randomness than the deepness would imply. Meh, I guess that's sheep for you. 
This seems like one of those games that are very dependent on all players being of semi-equal skill else the screaming "OMG! why would you do that?!" will start.

An excellent game! This game is amazing; you could play it just as well with tokens, but the sheep really bring something out in the mechanics. Now that I've learned it well enough, it can be played in a fairly quick amount of time. What fun! It's probably my favorite abstract, although it doesn't feel like one.

Beautiful sheep pieces. The game system - rather awkward and unkempt. It's really just a very abstract game, foreign in fact to any younger player - wasted potential given the cute theme. I get it, but nobody else will - and so I just don't like it. Eventually, I flat out sold it.

The game in this version is easier than the older one, I'm not sure it's better. I prefer it with only two players, with 4 is a bit chaotic and with less control over the game. I wish to play with 3 players soon. Anyway, a good game.

Obviously, as everyone else has said, it's quite cute with the Wallace and Gromit looking bits, and I agree that's the primary appeal.  But the language-less movement boards never really "clicked" for me -- I kept having to ask what maneuver was what.  Played twice with three players, which worked well, but it's also quite clear that while there are tactics in this abstract game, there's not much strategic potential because each player's turn alters the board dramatically.  By the time you get to the last field, where each player only has a few movements types left, you can plan better, but since at that point you only have a couple of choices of moves yourself, it almost doesn't matter.  Also, the instructions were needlessly complex -- sometimes the explanation for how to "resolve the flock" didn't appear until two pages *after* the first mention that you needed to do so.  Light and cute, I'd play again, primarily as a filler, but I don't see it being a long-term favorite.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's good and I like it... now that that is out of the way, let me get a little critical.  

Some critics say that it fails because the cuteness hides a game that involves too much thinking, enticing the wrong playing group to try it.  I disagree.  The cuteness could and should act as a bridge to a thinking game for players ordinarily intimidated by deep-thinking games.  

Where I find it falls short is that the cuteness belies some pretty boring gameplay.  For what sounds like an intuitive ruleset (use different move options to create point-earning patterns), there is way too much bookkeeping (make a move, mark your move, move your marker, add the points, role the die, resolve the flock, role the die, etc).  There are too many tasks for too few decisions. 

I will give it some thought, and maybe come out with a variant I will enjoy even more.

Magnificent bits, but the action-mat is not clear enough in showing what the actions do. The four-player game is much too chaotic for my liking, especially the second and last scoring rounds are impossible to plan.

RATING: 7
A fun puzzle game.  A bit of a brain-burner.  Game consists of moving the sheep in various ways using a pool of limited actions in order to achieve different objectives.

The pieces are friggin' awesome!  Detailed ceramic sheep!  You can't ask for much more.  Totally worth purchasing just for the excellent sheep pieces.

I like puzzles and this is my kind of puzzle game so it gets a bump for that.  If you're not into puzzle games, avoid this one like the plague (excellent sheep pieces notwithstanding).

Very glad I own this one.  Will play it again, just not towards the end of a long game night.

If the theme were absent, this would be a rather dull abstract for me: that is a fact. But for reasons which I just cannot comprehend, the humourous sheep theme gives this game life! One problem with the game (other than the nightmarishly poor organization of the rule book) is that is seems highly susceptible to analysis paralysis. A lot of pondering is required for every move, quite surprisingly; but the sheep make it worth it!

A shaggy sheep dog of a game that positively sits up and begs to be loved.  The bits are very cute, the rules are riddled with sheepish puns, and the mechanics are pretty clever, particularly the manipulation of time, the limited number of uses of each type of move and the changing objectives.  My one quibble is about lack of control; a good position can turn to awful between turns. I'm interested to try the 2-player variant.

A wolf (i.e. A game with bite) dressed in sheeps clothing (i.e. it "looks" cute and fluffy). Strategy, Tactics, Mechanics and Theme blended together perfectly.

Very chaotic with four players, probably best with three but still fun either.

Ahh... look at the cute sheep.  So... why is my head hurting now?  

This is a surprisingly really good abstract game that is made up of 4 unique rounds that flow together nicely.  Game play is all about positioning yourself in the flock.  Sometimes you want to be in the front, sometimes at the back, and sometimes its best to be close to who you like or who you know.  It's a lot like life actually.  If you are lured by the components be prepared for a game that is more challenging than you might expect.  The game works well even with the 2 player variant.

An abstract game with a theme? It's possible with Shear Panic. Pick "moves" off of your player board to line up your colored sheep in certain configurations based on the round (at the top or bottom of the group, etc). I really like Shear Panic. It has great bits and the gameplay is surprisingly deep. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Many people mistake this game for something light and fluffy, simply because it features very cute sheep.  What Shear Panic is, however, is a nice abstract with a great theme.  In fact, it's much more of an abstract than some other "abstracts" like various Knizia games---apart from the occaisonal roll of dice, there is no luck.

There is, however, a lot of chaos with more than two players, as multi-player abstracts tend to be.  And there is enough randomization at the start of the game (but again, partly controlled by the players) to guarantee many unique games.  Plus there is truly a large sequence of ways that you could play your various actions, especially when you consider your opponent(s)' actions.

The new edition comes with a two-player variant that I find very decent, on the same level of enjoyability as the regular 3-4 player game.  In fact, I think people might like the two-player version better in general due to the decreased chaos.

As for components, those in the first edition were nice enough---in particular the sheep.  In the second edition, we keep the same sheep (!) except on thick and sturdy wooden bases, and we turn the mutton buttons and scoring counters into wood.  I think the design of the pictures for the actions are less clear than they were in the first edition, unfortunately.

RATING: 8
Excellent components just add to this gaming experience.  The silly, playful appearance of this game really entices non-gamers to attempt something with a bit more strategy.  The scores are usually nice and tight so that anyone can win as you enter the last field.  The only drawback is that you often will have little control over what scoring is available until your turn rolls around because the flock changes so dramatically from turn to turn.  Therefore planning ahead is difficult and this can lead to a bit more analysis-paralysis.

Still I love the depth of the gameplay with the light and fluffy shell.  I'm convinced that my wife likes the game primarily for the components and that is fine with me because I get to try the strategies.  There's so much to plan out on your turn between selecting the wisest flock movement, guessing what others might do before your next turn, and deciding how far you will move the flock marker it will really get your brain working.

Cute sheep, an even cuter ram, and a not so quick or easy abstract game! It was easy to teach (I taught about 5-6 people how to play) in 5 minutes. More fun if you play with the ram and make him go around checking out the sheep, etc. Ok, or at least that's what I like to do!

A brain-burner disguised as a no-brainer.

At a first glance, Shear Panic appears like a no-brainer, mainly due to its cute miniatures, humorous art and filler-smelling, kids-winking theme about a sheep flock: yet in its core it’s a brain-burner, since it gets quite challenging and mind-racking as soon as you start playing it.

It’s likely I approached this game the wrong way, since I expected a light filler and instead found myself struggling with a game requiring heavy thinking, yet still I can’t feel any wish to play it again, even less so as the exacting game it is.

RATING: 7
Fun tactical game. Very abstract, which isn't usually my thing, but the sheep are so darn cute that it's totally worth it. It's deceptively difficult, though, trying to figure out what move to make on your turn to maximize your points and minimize everyone else's. Very little long-term control, especially with more people. I've played with 2 and 3 players. Both worked fine. I think I like the 3-player game more, though, because you have a weird extra thing to do with 2 players to move the game along, and I wasn't crazy about that.

2 plays.  Not enough control.  Turn order is huge.  So is being at the right place at the right time.  Generally, the options for plays aren't very useful... and your play can be easily un-done by the next player (except the rotates, which are painfully difficult to recover from when you get hosed).  I often find myself moving the "game time token" to a "panic roll" space to try to roll the white bullseye to rotate the sheep.  Losing one of your two sheep seems to be a death sentence unless most of your opponents have also lost a sheep.  I don't like having the "extra" sheep (4th color) in the 3 player game... they seem to get in the way, making it too difficult to affect opposing sheep.  Don't play without a timer (try 12-min per player); trust me... you'll be glad that you've saved time for better games.

RATING: 7
This game looks very nice, which attracts people to it! 

Simple game of four parts really, get close to or far away from a certain side of the board, get your own two sheep close together or get close to the black sheep. Each player has the same set of cards to use (one use each) to achieve this aim. The cards make a set of moves and also determine how far the scoring marker goes around a track which tells you when scoring changes between the 4 parts of the game. Neat idea!

RATING: 8.5
We are really loving this game. To make the two player variant more interesting, usually also pick one of the neutral colors as our hate-sheep. So player A plays blue and hates reds, while B plays Green and hates yellow. When you do scoring player A gets positive scores from blue and negative score from reds, and B gets positive score from green and negative score from yellow. That way you are always trying to advance your sheep and your opponent's hate sheep at the same time you trie to sabotage for your hate sheep and your opponent's sheep. It's fun:)

Not my sort of game at all - but gets an extra point for the cute sheep. Too chaotic, and too tactical in feel, you have to do stuff now to get stuff now, rather than lay long term plans. Can't see me playing this again.

One play. It's a lot of fun owing to the cuteness of the bits. As much as there are decisions you must make, it seems a bit random really. Hard to set yourself up for points since its difficult to force a scoring condition, which is ultimately what you really want to do. This game isnt one you can plot your moves for.

Juego de estrategia, basado en la gestión de un rebaño de ovejas. El juego tiene tres fases: acercarse a Rodolfo, el carnero seductor, chismorrear con berta, la oveja negra, o alejarse de jack, el esquilador. Está simpático. Materiales muy llamativos.

OK, i won, but i did not really know why. No use planning while it's the other player's turn, as their actions can shift everything. No use planning more than the actual turn, as any other player can change anything. Too random for me...

I like Shear Panic, but it almost never gets to the table.  I blame all this on my fiance, whose pick this was - she never wants to play it!  I think it's a nice little Euro with more strategy than you'd expect, and the pieces are VERY nice.  She just doesn't seem to care!  So much excitement over Roger and the sheep who love to be near him, and now Roger never sees the sun shine at all.  So sad... perhaps the saddest tale ewe ever heard?  (*Insert barfing sounds*)

RATING: 5
Rating based upon only a single play with 4 players. For an abstract with this much meaty play, I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. With 4 players, there is a long time between turns, and this is made even longer with players prone to analysis paralysis. Three players is probably a lot better. I also didn't feel like I had much control over what was going on, and that was especially frustrating for a game of more or less perfect information.

Shear Panic was part of my Secret Santa gift this year. My wife and I played 2-player, which is not really recommended, but we were eager to give it a try. The game itself is a cute, Hive-like spatial abstract with adorable components. The gimmick is also the weak link, however: players choices for the entire game are limited to a pre-set menu. Yet the particular choices were all too similar, and the costs of using a move at any given time were simply too opaque. I never felt the tension between taking an action now and saving it for later because the board state is too instable for “later” to have any meaningful content. Still adorable, but as a game it’s a bit closer to an alternating puzzle: figure out your single best move every turn and take it.

Unfortunately, my wife decided that she wasn't likely to play this again (although she loved the components).

Declan has been absolutely fascinated with this game, and we finally got to play it. For an abstract game it was really quite fun.  The boys liked it, and I think after a few plays we would all know what we needed to hold on to, an dhow best to score.  It also seemed like we had to keep referring to the rule book, as each area had to be dealt with differently.  Definitely a nice purchase, for the pieces alone, but the gameplay definitely added to this value for money.  Now to find more time to play it.

Under these adorable sheep lies a clever abstract. There's a lot of options for each turn and every one is meaningful. This is a unique game with plenty of strategic depth. While I appreciate the high quality bits, I sort of wish they were made of sturdier stuff. Perhaps hard plastic. One of my sheep came missing an eye. That minor issue aside, this is a good game and I'm especially happy that it plays so well with two. There's no real fault with the game - I just rarely get the desire to play it since there are many better abstracts.

Most awesome game pieces ever. 

Unfortunately, very difficult to teach. The player mat which tells you what moves you can make uses non-intuitive icons which require constant explanation throughout the game and even once players have some experience they still often need a cheatsheet to refresh with. As such, with a few exceptions I've gotten very few people who want a repeat game.

I really want to like this more. Maybe a re-drawn and more intuitive player mat would resolve the problems.

The sheep are so cute. I enjoyed the 2 player game I played. It is an abstract spatial game where you are pushing rows of sheep around or moving individuals to either group your sheep together or get to a certain edge of the flock. You are limited to twelve maneuvers and can only use each once which leads to your options reducing over the course of the game. I can see it would be almost impossible to control with more players though.

Under the fun theme and impressive components, its a fairly dry abstract.  I'm not sure there is enough control over the scoring for the game to REALLY work, but its still fun to play.

If you don't enjoy dry games, you're probably not going to find a lot of replay value here. But if you don't mind that element, there are some fun unique elements to Shear Panic that make it worth investigating.

I didn't play this during the initial hype. I remember there was a time it was pretty popular and slightly difficult to acquire.  Then, seems like lots of people were nonplussed playing it and a lot of copies were up for trade. 

I may consider picking up a copy, especially if I can get a good value trade on a used copy...but I won't buy it or go out of my way to acquire it.

I might rate this higher after I play it with more than two people.
This game brilliantly incorporates its theme; these folks know their sheep.  I was nearly laughing as I read the rules.  It's hard to imagine capturing the essence of sheep-ish existence any better in a game. 
The game itself is very clever, but the two-player variant is a little sparse in terms of what actually goes on in the game.
The components are nice, too.  You get 11 three-dimensional sheep figurines made from resin or ceramic or something.  They could have done it more cheaply, but then I think that the game would lose its cuteness and much of its appeal.

Worth it on the cuteness of the sheep alone!

Abstract strategy well themed with sheep who have escaped from a truck and are now moved about as a flock.  Each player has 10 moves available during the game which are covered by mutton buttons once used.  Moving one sheep almost always will move part of the flock as the sheep bump into other sheep.  It's interesting to play on a larger table and watch how the flock migrates throughout the game.  As the flock shifts, its movement take it through four different fields.  The goals that allow each player to earn points are different in each field.

Pretty fun. Possibly best with 3 (inclination after 1 game with 4). There's very little to be able to predict from turn to turn with 4. The bit, of course, are the main draw, but I still like the game, although it has a bit more chaos than I tend to prefer. One person in our game is convinced that there's a turn order advantage. I'm not so sure.

RATING: 3
First impressions: cute little abstract with a bite. Balancing the possibilities of your actions against the future when you might still need them is not easy. However, repeated playings have led me to conclude that the game itself, while beautifully presented, is lacking in precisely that area. It is virtually impossible to predict what your opponent is going to do, or what the board will look like after two or three moves, making it a very tactical game. Which is fine, but after a while your choices become so limited that winning or losing is dependent on a move you made near the beginning of the game, or the outcome of what a person threw with the panic die. There simply isn't much of a [i]game[/i] here. In addition, the rules are full of little details which are annoying to learn and hard to remember—there should have been a rigorous review of what was in the game before it was picked up by the major labels.

[b]Update[/b] Shear Panic started out as something awfully cute and fun, but now I find myself subject to the human version of 'shear panic' when I see people bringing this to the table. I won't exactly bolt, but to say that I'm eagerly anticipating its arrival would be a lie.

[b]Update 2[/b] Remains a classic example of form over function. The game is really shitty, and after a while you don't even notice the cute sheep anymore.

This game has an excellent theme, components, and cuteness factor.  Rules are not that clear, so advise downloading the player aids on BGG.  Unfortuantely, for an abstract type game, the game play has a lot of chaos which may turn others off.  It did for most of my family members.  Most of the positioning of your sheep are out of your control and it is very hard to pre-plan in this game.  Additionally, there may be a runaway leader element that requires players to make sub-optimal moves to stop the leader.  Personally, I'd like to play this a few more times, but it didn't win at my household.

This game is like a visual puzzle - the whimsical sheep disguise an old-fashioned challenge of moving tiles around to make a particular configuration.

This game breaks a lot of the rules we're used to with games. The flock is the board and it's constantly changing shape. The sheep are among the best playing pieces ever. The multiple scoring zones make it a little more difficult to teach, but it also gives some great variability.

There is a really good base idea hidden in layers of dirt-encrusted wool here.  But 9 sheep aren't enough for it to really shine.  Plus, the beautifully overproduced sheeples are perfectly designed to not be useful at all as pieces for this game.  Sharp corners make sliding moves difficult, and rotation moves incredibly annoying.

RATING: 6
After 1 3er play.....Great components.  This is pretty much an abstract game where you want to have your sheep (which are really tiles) arranged in a particular configuration.  The desired configuration changes 3 times during the game.  But you have other players messing with the configuration between your turns.  So there is a good bit of randomness to it.  Plus you have a die that is rolled for a "shear panic" which adds more chaos to it.  I don't mind chaos in games...if the theme is strong.  This one has just enough theme to squeak by.

RATING: 5
Players manage two sheep in a flock of 9. Each turn players select an action with alters the flock in some way, and advances time.  There are four different scoring quarters in the game, depending on the time, each requiring different formations for your sheep.  Quite a deep, thoughtful game, that belies the cute appearance of the pieces.  Nice game, works well.

A huge branching factor and minimal luck elements makes this game prone to analysis paralysis.  With 4 players it's chaotic and somewhat fragile.  It also has the opportunity for player elimination.  And the rules as written are a chore to comprehend (but it's not really all that complicated).  Despite all this, I enjoy it, but I'd rather play with fewer players or faster players.

I am not into Abstract Strategy. It's not my favorite mechanic/theme. I find it to be not to my liking compare to other game mechanics. There are better Abstract Strategy games out there. Yinsh is a whole lot more to my liking than Abalone.

I wouldn't say no to trying other Abstract Strategy games.

It wasn't really interesting for a 2 player abstract. Wasn't fun either. It's not my kind of game. It didn`t really impress me.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see my opinion changes.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

The sheep pieces are amazing!  In fact I find this game to be pretty cheap considering the nice components that come with the game.  The odd thing is that despite this game having such wonderful looking pieces, this game is an abstract through and through.  It's interesting that all players have the same actions and the game has 4 different phases of various objectives.  As an abstract game it's fairly enjoyable but there is a little bit of luck with the die.  Specifically rolling a white on the die can be really good or really bad depending on what you're trying to accomplish on the phase you're currently in.

Wonderful components including sculpted and painted sheep are the best thing about this game. It is not a bad game by any stretch, but it is not the most engaging either.

RATING: 4
Not sure what to make of this game. Is it a deep abstract strategy game with nice components, or a badly put-together game with nice components? There's probably some element of abstract strategy involved, given the propensity for Analysis Paralysis that can occur in the game. Downtime is a serious issue for a game that has such a light theme, and is a serious flaw in the game - I would not think of introducing this to my non-gaming wife. And for the "strategy", you can't really plan ahead, you can plan only when your turn comes up, and this is probably why downtime is so bad.

[1 play] Despite the amazingly over-the-top production values, this was not so great.  I played with 4, and it might be better with fewer players.  It was one of those overly tactical games where things change radically by the time your turn comes, and the wait is boring.

Sheep, very cute sheep bits. Ok, moving past that, simple scoring game where you have a fixed number of move (types) to use to control sheep movment for the whole game. There are ~5 different scoring mechanisms for different parts of the game and there is some silly randomness based on other people's actions. There is strategy/tactics to be had here and game could easily have decision paralysis problems if pace not kept moving. Very fun.

The Zoch edition is a big improvement on the original, and makes the game much more playable. It's much easier to get the fun out that was always lurking in this game. A good game for the family although there may be more negative play to spoil other people's position than positive actions to improve your own. Meaning that a weak player being picked will not have much joy.

Cute game of flock management.  Probably the nicest sheep miniatures ever but at the same time, the action display used to keep track of played actions has got to be the least user-friendly component I've seen.

Gorgeous components, but the gameplay is only 'meh'. There's not a lot of stuff you can do in the first place, control over when scoring rounds happen is rather limited, and usually the lucky guy who manages to trigger (and go last before) scoring runs away with the points.

RATING: 3
I got tricked into buying this from a 'friend'. It falls into an odd area where it's too simple for adults but too complicated for children. The action boards are a bit opaque, and we had to look up what each action was a few times. Towards the end of each game you generally don't care if somebody does an action wrong, as long as it brings the game closer to a close. Some of the rounds are fun, but ultimately the game lasts way too long for what it is.

Deceptively simple, but with great room for strategy.  Yes, it can lead to AP, but if played lightly, amazing fun. 


I think the 2-player variant gives players far more control.  I enjoyed it more than playing with 3, which felt very chaotic.  

I do love this game, but I'll tell you what...it's a lot more fiddly than I first thought.  There are a lot of things to do and remember, making it a bit heavier of a game than it seems as first glance.

Combination of a "found" $20 gift card and 40% off this highly balleyhooed game made it inevitable that I would buy it.  A game that requires a significant amount of time, thoroughly studying the rules to appreciate.  Teaching this game to newbies presents an interesting challenge for a "game explainer."  Traded away - there is sense of a disconnect between the abstract nature of the movement of the pieces and the board that awards victory points.

Bought the game based on BGG pre-Essen comments and pics of the sheep (didn't everyone?). Played it the hotel the evening of purchase. It took a couple of readings of the rules to get the first field scoring correct and the example pictures are WAY too small and dark, but otherwise everything is clear. Played well and, as you might expect, drew a lot of attention. Not a heavyweight but will be very useful for bringing non-gamers into the fold.

Minor niggle: I thought sheep formed flocks, not herds...

Minor giggle: turn the shearer piece the wrong way round and you get a whole different impression entirely of what he's up to!

Annoyingly, I don't seem to be able to find many opportunities to play this!

This was a nice little game. It could have easily been produced in a set much like Tally Ho!, but of course that wouldn't have had the instant sell out appeal of the cut sculpted sheep. But there is actually a game here, and it's pretty good. It is *almost* too long for what it is, but not quite. Nice choices that don't bog down too much. Certainly worth a play. *UPDATE* After another play (of the new edition), I find I like this even less. I think the problem stems from having too many options. Rather than a card of 12 moves with 7 different types, I think the game would benefit greatly from having a card of 9 moves with 3 types. That would definitely make it easier to explain and comprehend the first time.

The ultimate objective, of course, is to score as many points as possible during each phase of the game.  To accomplish this, a player must be adept at assessing how the various actions available to him will affect the positioning of his sheep in the herd.  This requires keen visualization, a skill at which I am woefully inadequate.  It can also possibly cause that dreaded down-time, as one or more players take excessive amounts of time in analyzing their options before executing their move.  So, gentle encouragement to the players to not take too long (whoa -- there’s a subjective concept!) when contemplating their moves is in order.

Like some other games, a player really cannot do much advance planning.  The configuration of the herd generally changes radically between turns, so a player can really only assess the situation on his turn, then execute the best action possible.  This situation can irritate some players, but I generally don’t have a problem with it.  It doesn’t bother me here, and I enjoy the challenge of ascertaining the best possible action which will yield me the optimum result.  Sadly, I usually fail at this task!

Shear Panic is truly a wolf in sheep’s clothing.  Thanks to the components and adorable components, one expects a cute, harmless family game.  Inside, however, is a very tactical game, one which is a true abstract at its core.  This will undoubtedly be a put-off to those expecting lighter family fare, but gamers -- if they can get past the idea of playing with sheep -- will find a nice challenge.

I think the game´s heart is the theme and those great sheep-miniatures. Once you play the game, you will notice that´s it plays like an abstract.

The game itself is solid.

At least one point of my rating is for the incredible graphic design. 

Update: After revisiting it, I had to downgrade it from 7 to 5. I seriously dislike the gameplay of this. There is a nice idea somewhere inside this, but decisions are very short-lived and the different phases make it overly disrupted. My daughter still likes it, but I'd be fine with not playing it again.

The components and theme are great.  There is not much depth in the game but moving and handling the sheep is a blast.  Two downers -- player elimination toward the end of the game and downtime.  There is a tendency to over-analyze and players that aren't ready for their turn drag it down.

A simple abstract positioning game from a design team that emphasises cute bits over gameplay. It's very tactical in nature, there's not much point in thinking about your turn before it comes round as the board changes far too much in between. Fun to be had, but kingmaking can creep in at the end.

The sheep are so cute that I liked this game before we started playing. It's a good game too, scores were close and that kept it interesting to the end. Seems that there would be a kingmaker problem a bit too often for my liking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The components are really unbeatable--these fantastic (and pretty big!) sheep figurines.  This is a multiplayer abstract with a significant random element.  It's not for those who want a lot of control, since you have little opportunity to predict what the board will be like when it comes back around to you and everything can go bad rather quickly.  But it is a nice little filler for those who like to puzzle out the spatial element, especially if they enjoy screwage.  This isn't necessarily my favorite approach to gaming, but it works well for the ~20-30 minutes the game lasts. (1 play)

Shear Panic is a simple grid movement game. First of all, the game contains cute and attractive sheep figures. The game provides visual satisfaction to certain players. It is certain that the game can fascinate who loves cute figures or sheep theme. Although the game mechanics are based on abstract strategy, Shear Panic still can be appealed to someone who doesn't like abstract strategy.

Got this based on some hype I read, and yes, the sheep are very cool.  I like it, the rules are pretty darn good and explanatory.  Playing it with my children makes it pretty random as you do have to plan ahead and visualize future happenings.  So, in that respect there is some haphazard moves and you cross your fingers and hope it works out for you. Good price,  and I'll keep it.  Totally different type of game to have in your collection

A great dirty little filler that feels very unique and puzzle like. 

Don't be fooled by the cute little sheep, there is a game here even if some luck is involved. Components are fabulous and game play unique and thought provoking. There is some unsettling randomness with the dice and some of the actions, even when YOUR rolling you never know if your going to actually benefit. In two of the rounds it feels like there is no where to hide due to the U-turn ability so you just set yourself up, watch the pace and other people's boards and hope for the best. 

The last round is super important, almost too important as when sheep get too close to shear panic they get booted from the game! Talk about screwage and the opportunity to score big is in this round and number 2. 

All and all a good filler coming in around 30 minutes good for occasional playing

Bought the game at the local game store, and one of the blue sheep's eyes were broken off.  Only copy in store, so I sent the company an e-mail.  A few days later, they wrote back saying they'd send me a new sheep.  A few days after that, the sheep arrived!

Overall, it's a very fun game, and the outcome usually comes down to the final couple moves.

This was our first family play of 2015 (and the first time we played). Based on the first few turns I thought the game would be greatly unbalanced but we ended up within a few points of each other and my youngest son (8) pulled out a win during his last move.

Word of warning, the rules are terrible. They make sense after seeing the Glover video for the game but I couldn't make sense of them before that.

While I do not think this will make the table often, it will be enjoyed when it does come around.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2018)

I bought Shear Panic on 2013. When I bought it, I was very excited about the legendary Lamont brothers and their games but I never played it then and now,  some time has passed ad my gaming tastes have changed a lot, now, I was pretty sure no game of theirs was going to be good for me, but I was pleasantly surprised by Shear Panic. It still isn’t a game for me, but it was much more fun than I thought it would be.

The game´s rules are a bit hard to grasp from the rulebook. The issue is that it first explains how to score and later explains the turn’s structure. Logically, it should be the other way around, otherwise you don’t have any context and you don’t understand what they are trying to teach. Once you know the rules, you can explain them under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes.

The theme is ok, it is novel though.

The game´s components are amazingly good, furthermore, if you take into account the year the game was published (2005). When we were playing the game, many people got close to the table to see the game. I think the game´s pieces are very fragile, but they look very nice.

At first, I was impressed by the gameplay. It was much deeper than I initially thought it would be, you have many available actions on your board and you can execute them once per game. I was liking the game at this point but then the luck factor came along and it destroyed my illusions for the game. When a player reaches a red spot, he has to throw a die and that makes the game much more chaotic. In our game, most throws were white (all sheep panic). Without the dice, the game has meaningful decisions, with it, it is pure chaos.

Shear Panic can be a mean game. Players can easily gang up on others. In our play, two player´s sheep were completely out of the game at the end.

Perhaps it can be a good 2 player game, with more players, the luck factor destroys the strategy.

Bottom line, Shear Panic is a gorgeous game that has interesting decisions, however, the luck factor makes the game (mostly) a tactical endeavor which is a shame. It was a lot better than I was expecting but it still didn’t make the cut for me. I already sold my copy of the game. I could play again if requested. Perhaps it can be a good family game.

So far we've only played with 2. It's a very nice looking way to present what could have been a pure abstract... the motivations and the moves allowed are quite natural within the theme. Just the scoring is still arbitrarily abstract.

I've only played several two-player games so far, and it's a so-so game.  The bits are fun, but the gameplay so far isn't terribly gripping.  If it was a shorter game it would make for a great filler, but as it is the game feels too long for the amount of enjoyment you get out of it.  Baaaaaaaa...

RATING: 6
Puntastic action selection game. This is basically four abstract games played in a row, with different ways of scoring for each, but the trick is that you have 12 actions to spread over those four games and you can't use any of them twice. Also, the final arrangement for the previous mini-game is the starting arrangement for the next. Gameplay is okay (moving sheep in order to gain proximity to other sheep), but it's the production that makes this special. What sheep!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A fun little abstract that changes course several times in the middle of the game. It's good to work the "timer" so that you have the control when the scoring happens. The pieces are, of course, great.

RATING: 7
Picked up at Essen 2005.
Played once in the middle of the night after a session of Antike so might have been too tired to fully appreciate it, but all three of us thought it was a good game. Preliminary rating would be around 7. As has been mentioned, it is really rather an abstract game (which I'm normally not too fond of) but the cute sheep make up for that.

Anyway, my initial (tired) impressions are that it has a strategic feel, but with the way you are affected by the other players' turns you are being limited to play it quite tactically (but with more plays that impression might very well change).

Update: played once more, and it felt like I had more control second time (I won! ;)). Rating might go up with more plays.

The game has some of the cutest pieces which might make you think it is a cute kids game. It is actually a somewhat complex puzzle game. You have twelve moves for the game (some are duplicate styles). Each turn the one you use gets blocked off and can't be moved again. Also you move through four fields which each has a different method of scoring. The game has some chess like strategy which can slow things down. The rules can seem a bit complex for what is a light theme, but we had some fun with it.

Perhaps no game has had better bits or ones more likely to draw a crowd. Despite the cute sheep, this isn't a kids' game; it's an abstract strategy game with four different goals depending on which "field" you're in but all revolving around positioning your sheep (two per player) relative to some other sheep or other object. Probably just a bit too abstract and nonintuitive to really catch fire as a gateway game, this does have the right stuff to be a good light-middleweight game for gamers or for those already exposed to a few of the more conventional gateway games, such as TtR or Carc.

I've eaten sheep brains, now i'll see if i have brains for sheep.

I am intrigued to know how differently this semi-abstract game might play with 2, 3 and 4 players. Does it go from a brain burner to complete chaos, and is it fun or just mutton dressed as lamb?

As expected 3 & 4 players causes too much chaos so a strategic game turns into an out of control festival of chaos. I prefer the brain burning aspects.

RATING: 4
I have never been convinced that the Lamont Brothers' games are well designed. I have only played a couple thus far, but their well known animal bits seem to me to be an attempt to mask deficiencies in the game itself. The way that the sheep are colored, with just a dab of paint on their back, feels very strange and cheap to me.

I am admittedly not the biggest fan of abstracts, but Shear Panic didn't change my perception of Fragor's work. The main problem is that for what appears to be a light, fluffy game, the amount of rules that must be digested is simply too much. Remembering all of the different possibilities in movement just seemed like more work than it was worth. Secondly, the multiplayer aspect made control seem like a complete illusion, since it was so easy for two players to gang up on a third. I would concede that it could have very easily been due to poor play or inexperience with the game.

I can definitely see why some people would like the game, but it just isn't for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A freeform Hive-type game with limited actions. Because of its "take-that" nature, the game can be quite nasty, and with 4 players, its easy to lose control of the game. With most 2 player games, you can instantly react to a threat. In this game, you can get really screwed before getting a chance to do anything.

Components are mixed (1st ed). Sheep are very pretty, but the player mats and scoring track are just paper. [Update] Haste Bock edition components are great and really change the game.

The game is really cute and the analysis paralysis surprisingly isn't a big problem here. A very tactical, fast-moving and often brutal game where diminishing options make it even harder to do well when the end comes nearer. Doesn't feel abstract at all because the mechanisms wouldn't make any sense without a theme. Better with 2 or 3 than 4 players. Possible kingmaking problems in the end.

This is an abstract puzzle with some good bits. I tend to ignore bits and production values and focus on gameplay. If you like abstract multiplayer puzzles you should consider this but try it before you buy. I will not play itagain but that is mostly an issue of personal taste. For a short game it felt there was a lot of downtime. You couldn't do much planning between turns because each move substantially changes the game state. It is very chaotic and there appears to be little benefit to planning.

Acquired in 2006 and played three games then. Total number of plays = 8. Cute sheep! First-time play is slow and a bit tricky to digest the rules.  Second game onwards is faster and fun. Overall, a silly game with nice sheep.

I like the idea and theme of the game. In fact, I'd say this game contains my favorite bits of ALL TIME. However, there is little control of your own fate. If you play this game competitively to win at all costs you may be dissapointed. In a multiplayer game by the time a round is finished, any setting of you do to gain points can EASILY be destroyed by the time it's your turn again. There's also a random factor in that events could make a die roll rearrange the flock, albiet slightly, enough that you have to just do what is best for you at any given point. No forward thinking. One move put a player a good 14 points ahead of everyone else and instead of me getting more points it came down to what would give her less points or allow me to close the gap... which never happened. There just isn't enough control of what is going to happen to allow for 'killer moves'. In fact, you can really over think a turn since you cannot predict what other people will do or what die rolls will be made. So I like it but don't buy the game hoping for a chess like thinking game.

Sheer Panic has some of the best components.  I was amazed at the quality of the little sheep in this game.  The game play was done with just 2 of us, my son and I.  I really liked it, it has a lot of thought and planning for a cute little game.  I am very curious how this game will play with more people.

A pretty game that is like an abstract strategy game combined with the luck of the dice and with an added layer of theme. But in the end it has only the fun level of an abstract, with an added and unnecessary dose of luck, and only the look helps make it more fun than it has any right to be.

Bought this game because of the game pieces. They are the cuttest! Sheeps!!! To my surprise it is actually a good game, you can play it as a family game or as a strategic game - the latter takes a lot longer. One problem though, you can completely eliminate a player in round four, before the game ends, so play this game with "your kind of people".

Lotsa sheep jokes were had by all...  I had a blast with it but see this as a once in a while play with the right players for overall enjoyment.  It can be overly analytical with the wrong players.  The player aid is not very intuitive on the new edition by Mayfair.

RATING: 7
Enjoyed the little sheep and the different mechanism(s) of the game.  Four different parts of the pasture leads to four different types of scoring throughout the game.  Twelve actions are available in the game until used.  If you don't enjoy games with lack of control and a fair bit of chaos, I'd recommend avoiding this game.

Shear Panic has adorable little lambs but a gameplay that is far, far too convoluted. The rules take too long to understand and explain for this type of cute game. Too many quirks and too much chaos.

[b]I wish I liked this more. The sheep are adorable and gameplay sounded interesting, but with 4 players a lot happens between your turns, which makes it hard to plan ahead. Also, you're often left with few to no useful options, especially late in the game. This, together with the fact that I found the different moves on the tiles hard to memorise, made me not enjoy this one a lot.[/b]

10 by heart, 8 by "mind". Read as "I'd really really love to give a 10..." but I think "8" is the "right" rating. Ok, by heart I'd gave a 10 to the game because THE SHEEP ARE SO CUTE. Really, the MOST MOST MOST BEAUTIFULLEST COMPONENTS EVAAR(ST) SEEN(ST) IN A GAME(ST)!!! This said, the game is fun but it wasn't so much fun if there were no sheep but just "ordinary" meeples or counters. A 7 for the game itself, and a 10  for the sheep. Gameplay is OK: easy to learn/explain, quite original and light-mid weight (can become a semi-brainburner if played with the right - or "wrong"? - players).Overall (don't ask me how do I mix the results) I give an "8". Great game to introduce non-boardgamers to games. Thanks to the sheep. Cute. Sheep. Really.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The idea of the game is brilliant: there's a flock of sheep, two sheep for each colour plus the unavoidable black sheep; each player has to score points by shuffling the flock configuration according to four different goals. If you have ever watched a flock of sheep now you understand what they are up to when they keep on swapping places and pushing each other: they are playing this game.

The goals are based on the relative position of the sheep in the flock. The game has four phases and there's a different goal in each phase. You get points depending on where the sheep of your colour are.

Two goals are scored individually: your sheep must be close to each other in the first phase and close to the black sheep in the third phase. 

Two goals are scored collectively: in the second phase the sheep more to the front of the flock can mate with the ram first (!) and score more points, while in the fourth and last phase the sheep more to the back feel safer and score more points because the first row must undergo the scary process of being shorn and thus removed from the board.

At each turn you can pick a move from a fixed set of one-shot possibilities (stuff like "turn the flock 90°", "push a row of sheep", "jump a line of sheep" etc.) and it's not easy to do the right thing. Basically, most of the game is decided in the the shearing phase, but this is OK considering the lightness of the game. What I find less OK is that remembering the meaning of the moves is not easy for casual players but that is just the kind of player that this game seem to be targeted at. Also the rules for rejoining the flock when it becomes separated are too complex for a family game.

The game components are very cute: heavy miniatures, much larger than necessary and carefully crafted and painted. They look like small statues. There are also miniatures of Roger the Ram and a sheep shearing another one (I thought humans shear sheep, but this is what you get). It's a pleasure to touch and move them.

I own the Mayfair edition.  The rules are somewhat unclear with typos.  To me, this game felt highly abstract and very tactical.  I really like the idea of having different objectives at various points in the game.  The components inside the box are really pretty.  The game is definitely clever.  

I very much dislike most Mayfair artwork.  I think the box and score board design look terrible.

It is possible your opponents could take you out of contention during the first shearing.  It happened to me in my first game and I went from first to last place before the final scoring occurred...  This left me somewhat cold.  Still it is neat and has some interesting elements.  In my mind it just didn't completely live up to the hype I read on the various forums, and I really wish the rules and examples were a lot easier to understand.

OK game, original with those sheep, Roger the Ram etc. However there is of course quite a bit of randomness in the game, dice rolls that you cannot control and your moves don't matter much if there is not a counting close by. But it's fun for sometimes.

I haven't played it, so I won't rate it. But I think this game may turn out to be my personal poster child for why Eurogames just don't do it for me. Sure, the components are excellent, and the sheep are cute as Hell. But this is a dry abstract that's not about anything and could have almost anything as a theme. You, uh, move the little sheep around in certain ways to form certain patterns and position them for, uh, points, based on, well, nothing that particularly makes any sense. The rules are a bit dense and seem overcomplicated for what this game is clearly intended to be. If this doesn't turn out to be dry, tedious and overlong, I promise that I will eat one of the little sheep. I bought this because my wife thought it was cute, and that's what I got for my money. A cute game that I'm quite sure will be more fun to look at than play. The pieces--which clearly will break if you drop them--tell me everything I need to know about this game. It's only supposed to look fun, not [i]be[/i] fun. It's for serious people. Serious people who would never, under any circumstance, become lively enough during a game to risk dropping a piece.

Cute and engaging game with lots of neat ideas thrown in. I like how there are four completly separate scoring rounds and how the scoring criterias change between them. I also like the timer mechanism and how it can give you additional "ram slam" actions -- but only if you time it just right. I wish that the first round was about 6 timer points longer, and the 3rd round maybe 3-4 points longer. Otherwise, this game is awesome.

Puzzle game, with great pieces; it's kind of like playing two games at the same time, since you're playing a nim-like game advancing the scoring marker, whilst trying to optimise your position on the board.  I suspect I'll like it better with three than with four, due to the greater degree of control.

Amazingly different game experience than I thought it would be.  Cutesy theme hides a deeply strategic, 'thinky' game.  The group loved this and had a great time trying to out maneuver everyone else.

The rule book makes this seem very confusing. Well, it is, but once we got the ball rolling, it started to make sense. Strategies were a bit hazy, though. The components are top notch; the game, I'm not so sure.

I think the fantastic value of bits for the money is actually its downfall.

The sheep are amazing and the board is really nicely done. Great color scheme and humorous pictures and all that...

But it's really just a confusing abstract. Actually, it's multiple confusing abstracts that are mashed, unsuccessfully, into one game.

For the most part I never really knew what it was I was supposed to be trying to do. When I did figure that out I didn't really understand the why of it. And when I finally figured that out it was time to switch to an entirely different game-within-the-game.

Feels very much like they had these great little sheep and sort of threw a batch of boring minigames at 'em and called it good.

After my first game, I think I prefer their first game slightly more. The idea of expanding LeapFrog to 2D space, plus giving each player their own turn in order to reduce the chaos, sounded all good. However, while the game is very tactical at best, this one takes much longer that its old brother, which kinda takes away the light fun that the game intends to bring.

Nicely crafted and funny to look at but this game demands some planning and scheming something I generally enjoy.
But early during the game I fell behind and was never able to close up to the other players. The game was very early decided and even after recollecting the moves I was not able to figure out where I went wrong.
This feeling of luck-dependence may change when we play it again.

The first game it took a considerable amount of brain power to wrap my head around this abstract game.  After two plays I feel like the game will really start to open up.  Especially for 4 players whom know what is going on.

Just played this game 2 player now.  I thought it would not translate well, however, great great time playing either 4 or 2 player.  Same strat, maybe even more so 2 player.  I am really liking this game nowadays.

Don't let the cute sheep pieces fool you.  This is a strategy game through and through, and a really good one at that.  I really like the way it forces you to change your strategy FOUR TIMES through the duration of the game.  Forward thinkers will have a blast with this one.

RATING: 6
First impression (3 players): I must first say that sheeps look gorgeous but they really are waaay overproduced and big. Almost all other components left something to be desired. The board could have been a bit more clear about what you're getting points from and the player mat of actions could also be a bit more clear how actions work. These are probably only problem for the first game(s) but they bothered me.

About game itself: It's mostly a tactical sheep manipulation. You have set of 12 mostly different actions you can manipulate sheeps but you can do each only once (I liked this). You want to have sheeps positioned in such way they gain points (and make it harder for other players) in 4 different phases of game. 

Thing can be quite chaotic as you cannot predict how things go because of extra push-action of sheeps that's random because you cannot know what color sheep will do the pushing. Timing of scorings is also most of time at the hands of other players. There is also plenty of chances for a little bit nasty player interaction. Especially in last scoring phase where some sheeps are eliminated from the scoring...

On the other hand you know what actions are still available for other players so the game can drag with players with Analysis Paralysis problem. 

It would be sort of nice filler in a right crowd but can easily be too long for what it offers if played too slowly.

Plenty to love here with the cute sheep figurines and a sweet little optimisation game which requires lots of planning and know-how to get right. My only complaint is that is seems too short for what it is: there are too few turns to get a proper strategy working, and you end up with a nice bit of fluff but nothing you could really work at. It's almost the epitome of over-production, too.

The strategy is minimal; it is more of a very nicely made filler. I did enjoy it and people always want to see it, since it has some of the nicest bits I have seen. It does play at two, there is a slight variant where you both share a third board, so that the flock marker will make it to the end of the track.

This is a tactical abstract game in sheep's clothing (ha ha).  You're trying to position your sheep pieces relative to other sheep pieces depending on the current goal; there are four different goals that change as the game progresses.  You have 12 different actions to choose from, but once you use a particular action, you can't use it for the rest of the game.  In the first and third phases, you score after every turn, but in the second and fourth, you only score once the game progression marker reaches a certain point.  I found this last fact to be a little troublesome, as essentially a random player would get the last move before scoring, which is a big advantage.

I enjoyed the fun tactical bits of configuring your sheep.  The key to the game is the scoring transitions as you move along the board.  This now reminds me of Lewis and Clark, so if you like this game, and want much much more - try that one.

A laugh-provoking "party" game, which is actually an abstract strategy one with a big dose of chaos. There is no real strategy though, only tactics based on what the previous player does, and since you can't plan anything ahead of your turn, there is some downtime. 

Players move a group of sheep by row, column, diagonal, or idividually, according to a die roll and some preset rules, atempting to get their own two sheep as close together as possible, which is how one wins victory points. I generally like abstract strategy games, but not a chaotic one like this. The funny theme didn't grab me either. The game is very long for what it is and the rules are terribly written.  However, the sheep are very cute, and apparently hand made.

Cute sheep! But behind the cute facade is quite an interesting game. It's certainly not the most tactical thinking game in the market, but it's got a fair amount of decisions to make with big consequences.

Enjoyable game with really nice pieces.  (Too nice actually, I'm fearfull of them breaking).

Plays well with 3 or 4, haven't tried it with two.
The random roll of white on the bonus rolls is too swingy for some people, but I don't mind it.  If you don't like the random ewe turn you can always change it into a lamb slam on the colour of your choice.

I like the over-the-top components a lot since the price wasn't also over-the-top.  Yes, it plays out like a thinky abstract, but it's well-done and I appreciate the clip of the game as it pushes you to a quick finish.  It's also refreshing to see a game that changes up (even slightly) what you're trying to accomplish in various phases of a game so if you would normally get too far behind to catch up, perhaps you're better off planning for a future phase to get a head start on the next field on the map.

A game about pushing sheep has no business being this much fun. I'll admit, I had a big goofy grin on my face the entire time I was playing. The awesome production values definitely helped.

Edit: three years later and I've added it to my collection. What can I say, the price is right.

RATING: N/A
A triumph of pieces conferring a sense of theme. The game play is OK, but with more than 2 it is hard to have much control over what goes on. The limited selection of actions doesn't work as well as it should - maybe a matrix relating your play to options now available to your opponent would be more interesting. As it stands, you save Ewe Turns for rounds where facing matters and Lamb Slams for the others. Not really that much here other than gorgeous pieces, and the complexity is probably a little too high for family play.

The sheep are perhaps the greatest game bit I've experienced.  That's worth some of the rating by itself.  However, the game is fun as well. Interesting flock dynamics are the bread and butter of the game.

RATING: 6
Fun tactical game, with some tricky spacial relation puzzle-like scoring mechanisms. Very abstract, with cute overproduced bits. Game can suffer from AP because the puzzle like board shifts from turn to turn- leaving the current player with a fresh board to analyze when it gets to his/her turn. Plus you have to take into account all of your moves, future moves, scoring track fields, and attempt to anticipate what your opponents will do with the options they have left on their board. It's extremely difficult to plan ahead, especially with more players in the game.

RATING: 6
Very tactical game with limited control. I wish the gameplay lived up to the quality of the bits, and a board wouldn't go amiss, but essentially this is an abstract game. Verdict: meeeeeh. Oh, and one of our group thought "rampant" Roger needed to be outed.

Once you get past the rules, the game is simple, fast, and even somewhat interesting.  It is mostly tactical, but there is some strategy in saving certain moves for later in the game.

If the sheep weren't so adorable, I doubt anybody would pay the game any attention.  It is otherwise quite forgettable.

RATING: 6
So. . . I got this one. It continues the trend of buying games that are "cute" and have fun looking pieces. Got it for $15 at GenCon.

All in all, the game has potential for a group that might play it more than just a few times. There are several different types of actions, and the first play is spent familiarizing oneself with the actions one can take.

The rating of this game may change.

--Oct2006-- Far more amusing than I had imagined from the simple description.  For that matter, a tiny bit more chaotic (and, as a consequence, less brain-burning too.)  The bits are quite delightful; game-play is reasonably clean on the second or third run through.  Quite a load of fun, in all.

RATING: 7
This is a great game.  The game could fit into the abstract category, but you can tell that the designers really thought about the theme.  While extra cute...  there is a really viscious game in this box.  You really have to watch your opponents carefully and also manage your own options, of which there are plenty.  My favorite aspect of this darling is the 4 different sections of the Score track and thier individual scoring rules.
While your turn is nearly completely tactical there is longer term strategy to your choice of the 12 actions available to you.

This game hasn't aged well for us - it's something we pull out every once in a while, but it's not one of our favorites. The cute sheep figurines remain the most endearing part of the game.

The rulebook is terrible - watch the Board Games With Scott episode to learn how to play this game.

The lack of a dedicated two-player board is a letdown. My wife and I play a two-player variant by adding +1 to each movement value.

A fun theme to attach to an abstract game, with cute bits. The four different scoring stages keeps it from getting boring. With more than two players there just doesn't seem to be enough control on your turn and I can't quite spot where the fun is other than with the theme and bits.

The reprint looks really attractive and I might cave and pick up a copy since I made a conscious decision to avoid the first edition.

A first edition came my way and I caved...

Fun abstract with clever mechanisms and gorgeous sheep pieces. The game is split over three phases and players try to use actions to jockey their sheep into scoring positions. These action include pushing a line, jumping over other sheep, turning all sheep 90 degrees and more. Each actions pushes forward a timer on a track that in turns triggers scoring. Very clever.

Lots happening in a space of 45 minutes BUT please use the Haste Bocke rules regarding shearing of sheep. Instead of LOSING their sheep, players only get 0 points if their sheep would be sheared. This prevents players beating up on the leading player.

RATING: 4
Outside of the pieces there really isn't anything special here.  There are many arbitrary conditions for scoring pasted on in an attempt to utilize pieces that were bought cheap on the home shopping network. I guess it is an attempt to inject humor into an otherwise dry abstract game.  

That said, there are some decent decisions to make, and it works well as a light distraction. Overall though, it seems like there are a number of dead spaces in the game, as you are not always able to score, and yet as much as you would want to manipulate the set-up for scoring, it usually is inconsequencial.  What a turn often leads to is the illusion of action.  You move the sheep, you disconnect a few, and then you roll the die (which more times than not makes no difference in the outcome).

Perhaps I should make a game up out of Precious Moments figurines.

RATING: 8.75
Yes, this game could have been done with just colored cubes/tiles with printed arrows on top, but, fortunately, that wasn't the case.

The theme and the adorable bits and pieces are a big part of what makes this game so much fun, especially as we make all sorts of bah-a-a-a-ad jokes. Everyone I've played it with so far loved the game.

Besides the mere eye-candy, the game does offer some complexity, since a lot of things change in-between turns; a bit of planning never hurts. In the beginning pretty much anything goes, but as the flock passes second half one can strategize by taking into account what other players' moves are still available.

RATING: 7
I actually wasn't expecting much with this.  I think this game falls into that category where if you expect a lot, you'll be disappointed, and the opposite is also true.  There's probably a clever phrase for this phenomenon, but it eludes me at present.
Players have two sheep in a field of nine (the token black one is neutral).  Each player has the same 12 actions that they can take exactly once during the game.  Each action moves the timer a number of spaces down the scoring track.  There are certain milestones along the scoring track that trigger either scoring or a change in strategy.  In the first phase of the game, players are trying to get their two sheep near each other.  In the second phase, you want your sheep in the front row (facing forward).  In the third phase, you want to be near the black sheep, and in the fourth, you want to be in the back row (away from the shearer).  

So it's essentially a multiplayer abstract.  That much I was expecting.  However, the goofy theme does somehow win through while you're playing, and it's easy to have fun with it.  The rationing of your possible actions can really help you in the late game, but much of the time, things are out of your control.  You probably have two chances per phase to affect the setup, so the best option is often to get others to help you.  This is achieved by leaving them a best option that ends up helping you.  Would I have bought this without the Sheeples?  No.  Would I play it again?  Well, it's a solid BGG 7.0, so I'd usually be willing to play.  The biggest drawback to this game is the strict 3-4 player requirement.  It would be nice if there was a decent 2p variant.

RATING: 6
This is an abstract game played with little ceramic sheep pawns.  Players take turns moving the sheep around in different ways and score points in 4 different rounds based on the sheep placement.

I will start out by saying this is probably a great abstract and it appears incredibly accessible to all kinds of gamers.  I'm just not an abstract guy, they bore me.  I can count on one finger the number of pure abstract games I REALLY enjoy (Tigris and Euphrates).

This one is fine though, it has a lot to attempt to convert those abstract haters like me.  The theme is really cute coupled with incredible production values.  The gameplay is smooth and there are some really interesting decisions to be made throughout coupled with just the right amount of luck to mix up each play.  I just in the end saw that what was underneath was essentially moving colored pawns around on a grid to get the most points and when I see that I get sleepy.

Dispite its looks this game is not a children's game and can't be played by children or newbies.

First off, the sheep in this game are some of the cutest components I've ever seen in a game.  This game deserves to be purchased for those sheep alone.  It also doesn't hurt that it's a pretty good game as well.  It's a little chaotic (particularly with 4 people) and there's a little too much tendancy towards analysis paralysis, particularly for what is clearly intended to be such a fluffy game (pun intended).  But it's fun and short and oh those sheep...

Played 3+ times.  That's great.  I really like how you have a limited number of actions and it starts to seriously constrict you as the game approaches its conclusion.  I like the four different fields and how the flock marker goes through the field.  (Note: don't forget the other side of the field board and play a four player game on the 3 player board. The game feels neutered :)  Definitely not a light fluffy game, despite the components.  The components are great though.  Cerebral plus some chaos depending on the number of players.  2006/08/30

Certainly looks nice, with some original elements, but rules seem a little hodge podge and decidedly inelegant for an abstract. Time in each field seemed a little too brief as well, hard to make any kind of strategy (at least in two player). Three might be interesting to try.

RATING: 5.2
Slightly boring, is unfortunately the best description. It plays like a series of puzzles but where your choices decrease as the game goes on (as you mark them off your player pad) and so you can do less and less. Everybody basically keeps the same 'rare and powerful' options back until the end and so there is little variation in replays I'd guess.

With no catch-up mechanism if you fall behind, you're basically done for.

The cuteness made me want to try it. It won't be enough to convince me to play many more times.

Update: And it's worse with more players. Not being able to control when scoring triggers reduces the appeal of this even further.

An abstract in sheep's clothing. Not terrible, but not all that exciting, either. Seems to have some issues with player advantages based on turn order, and, while the choices are somewhat interesting, players often don't have as many options to affect positions as I'd need to see to play this often.

This game is a fun little game about manipulating location of your sheep in different ways each scoring round.  I think part of that fun comes from the production value of the great looking sheep sculptures you play with.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Cute sheep, fairly sensible rules, and an interesting thrashing as the sheep move around in the flock, all high points. 

Unfortunately, the game is too thinky for its length and depth and the choice of all possible moves can quickly become unforgiving. There's also a lot of reliance on the opportunities your neighbor lets past. 

I want to play this again, but I fear it's going to be a similarly painful experience, unless I can find a group exclusively of seat-of-the-pants players.

2 plays: Fun game with interesting decisions. The components are excellent, but when it comes down to picking a two-player game, my gf and I always feel like playing something different. This game does feel a little chaotic with additional players, and table time will dimish because of this - hence the low rating.

Interesting game. Very different, abstract game. I don't think it suffers analysis paralysis since there are moves that seem pretty obvious given the choices available. More plays needed to evaluate game.

With four players, this game is less predictable and you lose a lot of control if you are not in a scoring position.

Meh.

Played:  Once.  Wow, those are some really great components.  It just goes to show that great components and great art don't make up for bad game play.  There can't be a worse ending than on your last move you are forced to decide which opponent wins by your play.  Not saying that it'll happen every time, but it happened.  Also, there can be no planning in this game since it is so extreemly chaotic.  The entire makeup will change by the time it is your turn again.  The components are great though.

at 3 or 4 players, you have neither enough control over when scoring happens (giving whoever gets to move right before it happens the heavy advantage), nor will you have any inkling of what the board will look like when it comes back to your turn.  it is a chaos fest.

however, playing only 2 players using the "workaround" in the rulebook mostly solves those problems, making it the only acceptable way to play this.

Shear Panic is so weird and different from most other games, it's hard to know what to call it.  It's a game where you manipulate the positions of various sheep within a flock for maximum benefit.  To keep the game from being predictable, you score 4 different ways through the game, and each player gets to choose from their list of moves...but only gets to choose each move once.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
As longtime readers would know, the awesome components in this are definitely part of our enjoyment. But the game is pretty good too. A simple game of choosing an action from your limited board, which causes the sheep to shuffle positions on the table. Highly tactical, as you want to position your sheep in the high scoring spots just as the scoring begins. I like how you have to decide if now is the best time to use a certain move, or save it for later. Also, the four different types of scoring means that once you have a good position for one scoring, you really have to work to get into a completely different position for the next scoring.

Played the mayfair edition. I thought the sheep were going to be fuzzy and soft but nope. I was scared of the sharp jagged corners of the bases. What if someone got angry and threw a sheep at someone? You would have blood on the table, that's what! I didn't like the finish on the sheep--they were rough and it didn't feel right. It is not a bad game but for my tactile and aesthetic pleasures it is not one to play again.

RATING: 5
There are some things about this game that I like, and there are some things about this game that I don't like.  On the plus side, it's a nifty little brain burner that's deceptively cute.  I like brain burners like this, even though they tend to frustrate me when I think I have made The Perfect Move™, only to see the next player undo all I thought I had already done.  On the minus side is the die.  I can see using it in the initial part of the game, where players are setting up the board, but beyond that, it brings a little too much chaos into the game.  I suppose it's manageable, since you can plan your move to prevent you from landing on the spaces where you have to roll the die, but it can really undo a lot of careful planning.

I think this might be a better 2-player game than a 3- or 4-player game, just to alleviate some more of the chaos.  It's also prone to AP, but that's only troublesome when it's someone else's turn, because it's a sure bet that when it comes back to you, you're going to be taking a lot of time to plan your move, too.

It's been said that the sheep models are too cute for such a heavy abstract game. I suppose that's true, but I can guarantee you that if this game was released on a grid board with poker chips for pieces, it probably wouldn't sell a lick. The game play is just not interesting enough for it to stand on its own in that sort of format. Nor would it be much fun to play. The movement rules really are tied to the theme and only make sense in that context, abstract or not. Besides, the silly sheep sculptures keep you smiling even when you are burning your brain to figure out which move is best for reorganizing your herd. I wouldn't want to play this game any other way.

The concept involved moving sheep around with respect to the rest of the flock to achieve a certain goals. Goals were: being next to each other, being next to the black sheep, being at the front of the flock, and being at the back of the flock. It was a great mechanic. 
There is a bit too much luck involved, and the screwage factor is high. However, the theme made it fun. Also, this game definitely lends itself to a timer.

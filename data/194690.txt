Not bad at all. The game does seem to lack real excitement and contention - mainly because if you are terribly successful, you get 'cured' and are removed from the board. Also, you cannot place in the same zone twice in a row which further restricts contention (although you can move about sneakily). The 2-player variant is certainly passable, but not terribly exciting. I think this game would shine better with more vicious players. The theme and production is quite nice and there is some level of strategy in positioning and timing. So overall, nice game and would play again.

I like games with organized chaos; and Viral has plenty of it! BUT: you really have exceedingly little control over just about anything! And for a game with this level of rules complexity, one really should have more control.

It's very well-themed, however, and the 60's-ish art is delightful. Too bad about the tiny arrows in the arteries, though: look very, very closely at the board before you make your decision!

Awesome area control game that presents its theme perfectly. This is only enhanced by the cartoony art style. Programming aspect to the area control is fun, if potentially a bit punishing. Tendency to be mean, but not so bad if you're aware going in. Overall great game game with enjoyable tactical decisions.

I played this at the Dice Tower Con before it's release with four players. This is an area control game in which you get points for controlling different areas of the body with your virus tokens at the end of each round. The game lasts six rounds. 

You are putting your virus pieces on the different organs on the board, moving them about and killing other viruses (opponents) by playing two cards from your hand each turn. The cards played do not come back into your hand immediately; so managing your hand is an essential part of the game.

Initially, I thought the game was clever and interesting in the ways you are placing and moving viruses on the board, but the chaotic/random elements and a last player in turn order advantage at the end of the game just didn't sit well with me. I'd rather play El Grande for a similar experience with better gameplay/substance. Then again, this game has an interesting theme that makes sense and the quirky artwork might appeal to some. 

I need to play again to solidify my opinion.

RATING: N/A
Viral was the most disappointing game I played at BGG.con 2017 because I knew little of the game; then heard about it and read the rules and got excited about it; then played it right after that after waiting for one of the two library copies to be available; then was disappointed with how it went.

Seems like it should be a pretty good area majority scoring game with a clever theme that ties its mechanisms to the theme well. However, I have a significant issue with how the scoring works, specifically the tie-breakers. The game lasts just 5-6 rounds and each round there is a tie-breaking table that is set based on everyone's current score. When scoring happens in the body, the tie-breaking table seems to be used for more than half of the scoring situations. That means, we're basically just moving those in last forward and moving those in first backward each round. You can make some clever plays by absorbing other viruses and moving them elsewhere or adding shields to your viruses to strengthen them. Players add cards to their hand for different options as they move up the scoring track. I like a lot of the ideas here, but it feels like the game needed a lot more work. I did play with just 3 players and I'm pretty sure the game would be more interesting and contentious with 4 players. Then again, there would also likely be more ties and I don't see it fixing that major issue.

There are games like El Grande and Power Grid that have a "catch up" mechanism, but I feel like players are making more interesting decisions about where to position themselves in those games than in Viral.

A "different" area control game for sure, but I like the way it plays.  More "thinky" than you would think, but in a good way.  I personally like the artwork, but i know others at the table were not as big of a fan.  Overall, I think its a nice area control game, with an interesting hand building mechanism.  Might be a long term keeper.

After a two and three player game, my family and I love this one.  The art is adorable.  Kind of an Osmosis Jones look to it all.  It plays out very quickly and is very simple to learn.  All actions are on the board or player cards.  Very easy to follow, and seamless flow.  A little bit mean, but not too bad.  Every game will be close as the scoring can not  get too out of hand before your disease will be cured and you will be wiped from board.  We will play this often.

I was not a big fan of this, though I've only played the two-player game. I'm not very enamored with the morbid theme or the wacky art and area-control is not my favorite mechanic anyway. 

What bugged me most is that the event cards randomly reward or punish players in certain regions, which really only works in a multi-player game where group dynamics can "self-balance" the arbitrariness. With only two players, one player can simply get hosed again and again.

Nevertheless, the game does allow struggling players to catch-up, and I like how parts of the board "clear" when crisis and research events trigger. It's not a bad game. Maybe it's just not my style.

A wonderful area control game with just the right combination of accessibility, strategy, luck and cruelty. I love how the art softens the theme. Never has plague-induced organ rot seemed so whimsical! I do wish the components were a little weightier, though. The tiny cardboard viral tokens feel insubstantial -- I wish I felt more powerful as I piled them into the patient's brain.

[b]The theme:[/b] In [thing=194690][/thing], up to 5 people play as viruses competing for the most prominent organs in patient's body. The theme is not very realistic but the game works really well and I like how you can move through the body only when you use the natural pathways that are in the real body :) And I must admit, the theme really is unique in board games.

[b]The components:[/b] The production value is great. Everything is made out of thick cardstock. Plus, the art is amazing! The board is very clean and functional, but also colorful. The viruses are painted in very cartoonish, funny way so it helps with "depressing" theme.

[b]The fun:[/b] Oh, [thing=194690][/thing] is so much fun! Direct confrontation, a little bit of take that, area majority, hard decisions every round.... simply amazing!

[b]The gameplay:[/b] [thing=194690][/thing] is one of those games that have the perfect length for what they provide. There is limited number of rounds, which I love in games. Also, the turns are fast-paced and you are never waiting too long for your action. Although some actions are always inaccessible to you, you always have multiple good choices.

Beautifully designed board with a marker that moves down with each step of a round for easy following of game flow.  Rules are few & straight forward, so referral to rule book is infrequent...and adding to that, it is a great rule book!--so well done.  
     For me the game is more attractive in hand,  than in photos online.  I enjoyed the brief & unforced humor on the cards which adds flavor to the game.
      A much more complexly strategic game than is suggested by the current weight of 2.33/5.  Since all player's cards in the current round are visible, plus last round's hands as well, strategy is greatly increased, and well-laid plans often need adjusting--not always easy to do.  There is a catch up factor for the behind player & potentially keeps all players vying for the win.  I am not always a fan of event cards, but these increase player interaction & enhance the game.  
    Theme doesn't matter so much to me, but when one is carried out so effectively as this, I do enjoy it.
     Player boards came warped which effects play in no way but notable if you take pristine care of games.  Main board, no warping.

I love simultaneous selection and I like area control, so I should probably like this game a lot more than I do. The theme is fun, the art is great, the quirky map is interesting and the rules are simple and clear. The problem is the scoring.

I've only played with 5 players, so that will of course affect things, but in my play there was always a tie for everything. Since your resources and options are limited and you don't know for sure what everyone will do, there's usually quite a few people that go for the same area. This means that the tie breaker is incredibly swingy and since it's simply who starred the round with the fewest points. Also, being second to first/last yileds nothing in most cases, which just feels bad. In addition, the cure track is a neat idea, but combined with the turn order the game autobalances so that "bad" play gets rewarded to the point that the winner of the game is being decided by blind luck.  The card effects allow for some pretty interesting and flashy turns, but they're not necessarily rewarding, especially since because of the tie breaker, it makes sense to take the worst, most boring cards that give a lot of end game points, to make sure that you don't jump ahead so you don't benefit from the tie breaker.

It's official, I don't really like area control. If I don't like VIRAL, then I don't like area control. Saying I don't like this game goes too far. I do like it. But I thought I would love it given the quirky art style and easy rule set. But I find that this game shares similar traits with other area control games, in that it is very hard for me to plan ahead, especially if I am very early or very late in the turn order. Too early and players can undo what you did. Too late and your planned moves might not play out as you expected. That's just not fun for me. I like games where I can plan 3-4 moves in advance and pull off an interesting and creative combo. I don't find that I can execute like that in an area control game and no matter what game I play with this mechanic, they all leave me flat. VIRAL might be the best of this lot, but it's just not a lot I enjoy playing all that much. I needed this game to confirm that for me.

Very fun game, my only quibble is with the component quality. The cards are on the thin side, but the board itself is sub-par. My board has some wrinkles in the top sheet, and what looks like glue brush marks in places. This was a gift, so I can't exchange it. I hope mine was just one that escaped quality control. This is not a cheap game, and is touted as a Dice Tower Essential, so I expected better. 

It is a very fun game, both my adult kids enjoyed it with me. We played it several times in the first week, and I'm looking forward to introducing it to my non-gaming friends.

Viral is an area control game with a minor programming element. The graphic style is inspired by the off-kilter late'90s cartoon style. It is fine. Some people it will attract and some it will push away. There are bits of unique additions for the area control as viruses can only travel certain directions in the blood streams and when an organ gets too many viruses, they are lost. Viral is a fun exercise, but lacks the exciting tactical choices and built up turns for the attack that make the genre exciting.

Viral feels like a throwback to the earlier, simpler Euros that used to be all the rage and never really fell out of style with me.  I enjoy area control, and this is a fine example, with board placement and movement determined by personal card decks. Presentation and art are also very cute. I've played with 2 players and 5. It's definitely better with more players.

Tolles, mittelschweres Strategiespiel mit enormen Ärgerfaktor. Tolle Mechanismen, tolles Thema! Nicht für Leute geeignet, die sich schnell aufregen und der Kartenmechanismus sorgt dafür, dass man des öfteren grübelt. Zum Glück werden die Karten von allen Spielern gleichzeit ausgewählt. Nach der Aktionsphase werden noch 5 weitere Phasen gespielt, die nur der Verwaltung von Punkten usw dienen. Es wär schöner, wär die Aktionsphase mittig eingebettet, oder die Verwaltungsphasen kürzer, sodass der Spielfluss nicht so arg eingeschnitten werden würde. Da aber selbst diese Phasen recht interessant sein können, tun diese dem Gesamteindruck keinen Abbruch.

An area control game with a light hand-building aspect.
Interesting arcs during the game--you'll want majority in an area to score points--but scoring too many points will make your virus "discovered", flushing you from the board--which isn't actually entirely bad.
Every round you essentially will play two pairs of cards (action + location). Those cards will not be available in the next round to you, so you cannot simply focus on attacking the same area over and over.

An area control game about taking over the human body with viruses? Count me in! Or not....During a round two cards are played dictating the actions you take. Well say you play a brain card well the next turn you're not allowed to play the brain card until  the subsequent turn. Hated this mechanic. Made it feel gamey, and harder to defend territory. There are not enough locations to control, not enough cards to choose from. There are plenty of better area control games out there. If you want a medium weight area control game seek out El Grande, Ethnos, Tammany Hall just to name a few. Not to mention this game is way too long for what it is.

I like the game artwork, and I think the game did  a good job for what it is. I'm just not into area control as the main mechanic for games. Even though I won our 4-player game, I couldn't wait for the game to finish. The amoeba action is super powerful, which is great for people who get those cards early, but sucks for those who lag behind and waste their efforts to dominate an area only to get scooped up by the amoeba player. I did like that you couldn't return directly to an area for a few rounds once you played a zone card (e.g. the brain), so you are forced to come up with indirect strategies to maintain control, such as transportation from another organ (e.g the heart).

Really solid area control game, and likely my favorite of the Dice Tower Essentials line. It doesn't really break new ground when it comes to area control games, but what it does it does very well. I think the game might be a touch too chaotic to be seen as a serious game, and I thought the rule book was poorly presented. I'm also not a fan of games that go on for an arbitrary amount of turns, but it does make up for these shortcomings by offering tough decisions, excellent theme integration, and a neat hand-building aspect.

I'm not entirely sure that this will stick around, as I feel Blood Rage scratches a lot of the same itches for me, but Viral is a worthy entry into the area control genre. Plus I just love the visual of the virus chits on the board. I think an expansion could make this a definite keeper, as it just needs a little something more to set it apart from the rest of the pack.

Solid area control game. Quite simple to play but deep strategy. Each turn you play an action card and the zone card that determines where will you do those actions. The actions can be things like placing a virus, moving a virus, killing a virus, pushing a virus away, getting resistance or absorbing other viruses. The options are quite numerous with just this simple actions. It also has events which makes every game feel different and a deck of extra action cards that will make each players deck differently in every game.overall a solid game. Not sure if I want it in my collection yet. Maybe it could replace something... as it doesn't feel innovative enough

規則:
*圖板放置，4個危機標記放在右邊對應位置，事件卡洗勻抽六張放對應位置開著，剩下移除，隨機抽六個區域版塊放在六個區域上，白色面朝上，變異卡洗勻蓋著開三張，階段標記放在左上階段軌起始格
*每人拿一個病毒圖版跟對應的六張區域卡還有五張起始異變卡(右下角有你圖案)，2-3/4/5人拿8/7/6個病毒版塊，盾牌面朝上，隨機起始，照順位放圓片上到下到左下的平手順位軌，尾家開始反序放病毒到圖版空器官上值到每個器官都有，玩家不能放在同區，除非沒位置放，分數標記放分數軌0分，在一個標記放在左邊研發軌底格
*遊戲總共進行六輪，每輪六個階段
1.起始標記左傳(第一輪不做)，每人選一張區域卡跟一張變異卡蓋在個人圖版數字1旁，之後打開照順位結算，重複此步驟到數字2旁並結算之，之後把圖版上方的牌都回手，這回合出的牌都移動到圖版上方
>盾牌  翻面場上病毒到盾牌面，如果該病毒要被移除就翻面表示之
>移動 一個病毒移動到相鄰或根據動脈血管移動到相鄰的器官上，要照箭頭方向
>感染 放置一個病毒非盾牌面到一個器官(都在場上時可任意拿一個放，但失去盾牌面)
>攻擊 移除一個跟你病毒同器官的病毒
>吸引 吸引一個相鄰格的病毒(包含血管)到有你病毒的器官
>吸收 把跟你病毒在同器官的所有病毒放在你的下面，如果你被移除就釋放放在同個器官上，如果該病毒移動會帶著走
>危機 在該器官觸發一次危機結算，放數字最低的危機版塊上去，如果已經有或沒有版塊就不放
2.研究  每個區域裡每個器官都有病毒且最多的為該區域的控制玩家(平手則平手軌在上的贏)，照區域數字小到大控制玩家獲得該區域板塊上的上面分數(區域五額外一分)，且根據下方調整研究軌
*異變卡左上是行動，可不做，有藍框的只能在同時出的區域做，左下是分數
*遊戲過程中平手都是平手軌上方贏，只有最後分數平手是平手軌下方贏
*當有一個器官在2-3/4/5人時上面有3/4/5個病毒且沒有危機標記時，就拿數字最小的危機標記放上去
*增加分數時照順位，經過對應位置就抽變異卡，可選頂牌，一抽就補，如果選頂牌則把開牌放到牌庫底開新的，遊戲過程中最多獲得額外四張
*當有人超過或到21分時把所有區域版塊翻面
3.事件  結算最上方的事件卡後棄掉，棄掉最後一張時該輪為最後一輪
4.免疫反應 照危機標記數字小到大結算，該器官最多病毒的拿兩分，其他人拿一分(平手一樣比平手軌)，所有病毒回手(盾牌則翻面)，標記放回，此輪結束時，如果有符合規則沒有危機標記的就移過去放，但是下輪才會結算，多個時起始決定順序
5.治療 如果有玩家顏色的研究軌到頂，則所有場上該玩家病毒回手(盾牌翻面)，研究軌回到起始格
6.輪結束 平手軌照目前分數調整，最高分的最下面，分數平手的不動，被吸收的病毒回場上
*遊戲結束時，每個有你至少一病毒的器官一分，卡牌上分數，加總你分數軌分數，分數高贏，平手平手軌下方的贏
***2人遊戲***
*所有為使用標記當作中立玩家，起始放病毒時你放一個就要幫中立放一個，中立玩家的平手軌起始最高，一樣會計分，所有未使用的區域卡洗勻，第一階段時起始開兩張區域卡，放置中立病毒，該區域所有器官都放一個，中立一樣會計分，如果有事件牌要做決定由目前起始決定，平手軌也會根據分數調整
***變異卡輪抽***
起始每人抽四張剩下移除，輪抽值到最後1張左傳後結束，之後玩家決定四張卡的順序疊起開著放，可以看其他玩家的

It's clear know: If Gil D'Orey gets some assistance to polish his ideas into a game that actually works, you get an excellent enjoyable game (like in City of Spies). The rules are very clear and the icons on the board are very good to have an overview of what happens. Only the scoring icon of phase 2 on the research track is a bit unfortunate, but that's only a very minor complaint.

Card management game with area control. Really am not into the theme at all and generally wouldn't have played. But since it was there I tried it out. I thought it was a pretty okay game and could play it again, but overall I didn't really find anything that was unique and the theme is off putting.

The graphic design is fun and the cartoony artwork goes a long way towards making this stand out a bit. The unique theme helps make the rules a bit easier to learn and deal with. 

This is a pretty fine area control game that isn't too heavy on the rules. Ultimately though after my one play thus far, it doesn't really astound me. It's a fine game, but there are tons of fine games out there. I'll play this sometimes, but I don't see many situations in which I really want to. It's a bit too long and a bit too thinky for me to the point where I'm not sure it's a great game to introduce newer gamers to...and if I'm playing a game with experienced gamers looking for a 90 minute area control game I'm looking at many other better choices. 

A fine game, but one that makes me wish there was some version that played a lot faster with less rules so that it really felt like a good intro game to the hobby.

Nice area control game.  Artwork is awesome.  Theme is cool.  Gameplay is solid.  Area control is my least favorite mechanic.  I haven't tried El Grande, but Ethnos is my favorite area control game so far with this or Belfort being #2.

Fairly chaotic game.   If you get out to an early lead, you can be first to grab the more powerful action cards.  However if you are in the lead, then you are last on the tie-breaker track and there are ties most every round.  This keeps the scores relatively tight.

The area control is for 'zones' each zone has 1, 2, or 3 organs.  If you don't have a virus in each organ than you can't control/score a zone.   So you can snake someone by attacking one organ in a zone they would otherwise control.

We tried this one over lunch and weren't able to get through all 6 rounds (2 action cards per round for a total of 12 action cards played in a game per player).  But it was a first play for all 4 of us so getting through a game in 60 minutes seems entirely doable if you know the game.

A uniquely themed game that blends strategy and tactics to truly bring a great gaming experience.  A puzzle-y thinking game that forces you to think a couple steps ahead and react and plan for the round event. One must be thoughtful on which cards to add to your deck as you only get 4 of them.  Utilizing them is important to maximize your points.  The components and art as beautiful and fun. The unique theme works great with the mechanics and are intuitive.

The technique of the game is interesting, but it had some flaws that I didn't like. First player has a little disadvantage, especially with 5 Players, because every other player has the chance to twice react on what he does and he can't do anything about it.

At first I liked the mechanic that you had to rotate through certain cards and couldn't keep playing through a zone but it feels like you don't have access to critical plays too much or that certain turns are just not meaningful and there are not enough turns/rounds in the game for the inefficient turns to be viable. Hard to infect efficiently. 
I do like the theme but probably won't play this that often.

Area control game that limits your movement by card play. I had high hopes for this but it really fell flat for me. The rulebook is pretty horrid. Plenty of rules go unanswered. The art is good for the weight of the game as I feel this is geared toward younger gamers. I thought the theme was pretty fresh. My frustration comes with a few things. First, I believe it is greatly beneficial to play last and in a four player game the first and second player will play as first player an additional time compared to the third and fourth players. Secondly, the "adjacency" path is kind of a pain. The arrows are difficult to follow and each zone can actually be far away from another even when they are next to each other. Makes navigating around the map difficult. Thirdly, the catch up mechanic for tie breakers seems to almost overdue it. The games are usually pretty close but it feels like if you are able to keep it close until the last round but maintain last place to keep the tie breaker is also a huge advantage. I can certainly see why some will like this but it's certainly not for me.

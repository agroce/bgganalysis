Very colorful but not overly striking to the eyes. The colors make sense and the flow of the game is intuitive and more or less streamlined. Will add more later but overall impressions are Very Good!

The most interesting aspect of W200 is its treatment of leadership.  Napoleon, Wellington and Blucher have a diminishing capacity to activate their corps commanders and to restore those commanders' tactical value.  Corps commanders expend tactical value in order to manoeuvre their troops.  Coupled with artillery that runs short of ammunition, the net effect is that as the day goes on, both sides grow less and less capable of offensive operations.  Neat.

Less good, I think, is the potential to create almost invincible killer stacks (French Guards, British cavalry) that has been discussed in the forums.  Further plays will tell whether this strategy is too costly in leadership or can be countered effectively.  Less good also is the way that cavalry acts like mechanised infantry.  Despite these reservations, W200 is an intriguing design that I am keen to get played again.

Production quality is pretty good all round.  The map looks pleasing.  The labels on the blocks are reasonably functional, except for the tiny and unnecessary foot prints to remind of a unit's movement factor,  The rules really are a dog's breakfast; badly ordered and doing a poor job of explaining key concepts.  Do download the errata and FAQ from the BGG files section.

Bought it on June 18th 2015 at 11 o'clock. Luckily it was a Thursday (and not a Sunday as 200 years ago) so the shop was open. What a WUNDERBAR game!!

Initial rating after 1 play. A unique light block wargame on the Battle of Waterloo. There's definitely some good bits in there with the C&C rules and tough decisions to make in terms of how and when to use your tactical commanders, and when to use your strategic advantage.

The mechanics are a bit unusual, with the stacking restrictions causing some contortions to try to get your artillery and leaders in position for assault. Combat is unusual in that damage steps can get bled off for no effect. I'm not sure I like it.

The physical presentation of the game is somewhat poor. I'm not sure why they went with the tiny blocks. With the stacking restrictions, it would not have been a problem to at least use the regular sized blocks, and my older eyes would have appreciated it. I'm also not sure why they went with that weird box size, as it wasn't necessary for the components, though that's minor. Lastly, I have no idea wtf they were thinking when they put little shoes on the blocks to indicate movement. Just use a bloody number for crying out loud.

To top it off, the rulebook has some serious issues, as translated rulebooks often do, so the Errata/FAQ is essential if you're going to play. Not a huge deal for someone like me who is used to digging for living rules, but might be more significant for others.

With all that said, on the whole, it's a decent little block game that can be played in about 3-4 hours.

On a side note that the first turn may lead you to believe the game will last much longer, but the turns get progressively shorter as your commanders run out of steps.

An interesting block game with no dice.  You have to manage the dwindling combat power through the day of battle.   The French start in the VP hole so the early burden of attack is on them.  As the day progresses the burden shifts to the Allies.   Player have to make decisions of when to use the initiative disc.  The French generally need to use it to call for reinforcements.

I'm thinking the morale counter for auto-victory should be asymmetric.  Perhaps the French should be at 11,12, or 13 dead blocks before AV is called.   Maybe that could be a bidding mechanism for taking the Allied side?

Excellent: Tactical - Waterloo - Easy

In our wargame world with so many good designers and games, you rarely encounter a truly unique system. I got spoiled over the years and I have not been blown away by any wargame the past years, until now... 

At first I was sceptical as I was not sure about diceless combat. Although I admire Napoleon's Triumph as design, it was not for me so the game disappeared of my radar. Lately I read a thread about the game and had the rules explained to me. It souned really interesting and I decided to order a copy as the topic Waterloo pulled me over the edge.

I'm really glad I did. It is the best game I have played in years and I have played the game every day for a week now, since EastFront this did not happen to me.

The combat system combined with the command system is unique and I simply can't get enough of playeing it. 

-Excellent components
-Jump and play system
-Unique system, no game has anything comparable
-Comprehensive diceless combat system, I LOVE it as works really well.
-Great command system
-Plays in 1,5 hours and experienced players may even play shorter games.
-Clear and easy rules
-Surprisingly good simulation value.
-Good replay value thanks to random unit setup and forcepool a d optional rules.
 
Minus (nitpicking really)
-No Ney cavalry attack option(like Uxbridge) 
-Map is somewhat centered to the right
-Player aid could have had rules summary / extended combat resolution.
-Ziethen Corps is coming too late to the party (unless you activate 3 times)
-The sequence of play is on page 8, better to have it on the first or second page.

This game is ingenious and a very fun while being a surprisingly good simulation.
The surprise game of 2015. Hats off, this is really special.

Once you actually read the rules and stop interpreting what you think ... it is a simple, elegant and very smart design. I'd say innovative and clever too, fun as hell. Its been ahile since I've played a game 5-6 times to 'get it' and not got frustrated and sold it. 

Solid intro game with unique mechanics, excellent art and period feel.
Where is the CHROME EXPANSION;)

Very good dice less game mechanics which are tightly woven to produce an intense contest.

Not really a simulation of Napoleonic Warfare but an interesting simulator of command choices.

Not that difficult to learn and can be played in under three hours.

Really interesting.
Fast setup, historic flavour and strategy. Light wargame that works for me.
Only one game in my record at the moment, but enjoyed really a lot.

Added: more than 6 games, still fashinating. Struggling to win over the french side :-)

RATING: 8
Diceless combat. Random elements all generated by block fog of war and fact that reinforcements can just pop up on the map. Optional rules concerning morale and cavalry charges seem to change the basic game a lot. Interesting mechanic by which the players use up their leaders so their armies gets increasingly brittle as the game goes on. Not mind blowing like Napoleon's Triumph, (another diceless Napoleonic game), but much easier to comprehend and get into. Also relatively short- probably most games will run about two hours from set up to finish.

Very good game once you understand the rules. The rulebook manages to make this game seem more complicated than it actually is. Quick to play and is one game that I never pack away after one play through.

This is an ok game. Love the board and components and it has some nice new features. It invites to think tacticaly. However it is not an intro level game and has a combat system that really needs to getting use to. One big flaw is no fast cavalry. I will play again and see how it goes.

RATING: 7.7
An interesting take on block gaming.  The diceless combat, restrictions on number of units per area, key locations, and differing terrain defence values make you focus on what were key areas in the actual battle.  initial plays had me running around killing whatever I could while I got a feel for the game.  I soon drained my command structure and the nuances of the game became more apparent.  I'm not sure I could play it in the two hours listed but that doesn't mean it's not fun.

RATING: 9
Very enjoyable game and has a unique take on other block games. The rules are easy to grasp but there's a lot of strategy and options to weigh each turn. My only quibble is the optional rule for morale which is very penalizing, can create a snowball effect, and doesn't allow for recovery. The good news though is that it's an optional rule!

cav being merely fast infantry (no squares, charges combined arms or penalties in forest) gives rise for concern. also, hit system too cute/gamey by half. otherwise outstanding.
suggest houserule that a hit mustbe taken if possible (ie, 2 white units at cv2 taking 2 hits can take 1 hit each for no effect)

Enjoyed the first play. Wasn't sure how much I'd like a block game without a dice mechanic, but the role of leaders, the stacking limits, terrain bonuses, and the distribution of hits make for some deep thinking between impulses.

Mit Abstand das aktuell beste Waterloo-Spiel auf dem Markt. Herausragendes Spiel-Material (selbst ohne "mounted map"), konzise und nachvollziehbare Regeln, überschaubare Spieldauer (max. zwei Stunden), ansehnlicher Simulationswert, hohe Wiederspielbarkeit. Eine uneingeschränkte Empfehlung!

RATING: 9
Once I get past my quibbles about unit designations and ratings this is an amazing game.

Incredibly elegant and makes the best use of the block's fog of war potential in that the combat system is diceless so you usually can't be sure if you have enough strength factors to break the enemy.  This is abetted by a "random" setup which provides the guess work in combat and the overall replayability of the game.

Leadership management also makes this game play more like chess --but way better-- because it is WATERLOO!

En avant!!!

When a bicentenary comes, this is finally celebrated even if it refers to a cruel battle as Waterloo was. Maybe ‘celebrating’ is not the right word and we should better use commemorating, and that is what Waterloo 200 does, it commemorates a historical battle, one of the most emblematic, giving us the opportunity just in a couple of hours of emulating the Allies success or, ruling the French corps, changing the pace of history forcing Wellington to retreat towards Brussels.
What I like about wargames, which it is rather hard to find in Eurogames, is evocation, the ability of giving you the feeling of being in another time, at another place. Waterloo 200 achieves this due to its magnificent Art: a beautiful and practical map and those blocks with their stickers of the corps and officers’ portraits, making of it all a great whole. About the map, the game has one cardboard one which is perfectly suitable for it, but you can also buy an already assembled map, the heaviest map I’ve ever managed so far (which also includes great historic notes to create the right atmosphere).
Waterloo 200 is not a hard game, it even can serve as the starting point to wargaming. Basically, during the game, we all have to decide if we want to carry out tactic or strategic actions. For the strategic actions we play the Initiative disc, in order to ask for reinforcements or that our leader assumes a direct command of the forces. This can give us a great advantage although it implies the loss of the Initiative Disc in favour of our opponent.
Tactic actions are developed by our officers, moving the combat units and fighting in the battlefield. Combats are the main characteristic of the game since they are diceless. Fog of War relevance is at hand in the showdown and we discover the enemy’s amount. We control the terrain, knowing how it is going to affect the combat, but we will never be sure about the opponent’s intentions and if we will be able to overcome his forces. This is an easy and elegant way of showing the lack of information, chaos, lost messages, misunderstandings, all of it adorned by the black powder smoke along the battlefield.
If I have to add any ‘cons’ to the game it is the size of the wooden cubes that show the area control and which are not suitable for my ‘pianist’s fingers’.
To sum up, if we want to be Napoleon or Wellington for one and a half or two hours, there is no better option than Waterloo 200.
As a bonus, if there is any doubt about the rules, its designer, an hyperactive man, is always ready to solve it.
_________________________________________________________

Cuando llega el bicentenario de un hecho, éste termina por celebrarse, aunque el hecho sea una cruenta batalla como Waterloo. Puede que “celebrar” no sea la palabra más adecuada, que sea mejor hablar de conmemorar, y eso es lo que hace Waterloo 200, conmemorar una batalla histórica, una de las más icónicas, y darnos la oportunidad de, en un par de horas, repetir el éxito de los aliados o, al mando de los franceses, revertir la historia y poner en fuga a Wellington hacia Bruselas.
Algo que me gusta de los wargames y que me cuesta encontrar en los eurogames es la evocación, la capacidad para situarte en otro tiempo y lugar. Waterloo 200 lo logra gracias al magnífico arte gráfico: un mapa bonito que no deja de ser práctico y los bloques con las pegatinas de las fuerzas y los retratos de los oficiales, formando todo un gran conjunto. Hablando del mapa, con el juego viene uno de cartón que cumple sobradamente su función, pero se puede adquirir aparte un mapa montado, de largo el mapa de más peso con el que me he encontrado (además viene con unas magníficas notas históricas para ponernos en situación).
Waterloo 200 no es un juego complicado, incluso puede ser una puerta de entrada a los wargames. Básicamente, cada turno tenemos que decidir si llevamos a cabo acciones estratégicas o tácticas. Para la acción estratégica jugamos el Disco de Iniciativa, para pedir refuerzos o que nuestro líder se ponga al mando directo de las fuerzas. Puede darnos una gran ventaja, aunque conlleva que el Disco de Iniciativa pase a manos de nuestro contrincante.
Las acciones tácticas las llevan a cabo nuestros oficiales, poniendo en movimiento a las unidades de combate y luchando sobre el terreno. Los combates son la principal característica del juego, ya que no hay tiradas de dados. La importancia de la niebla de guerra se pone aquí de manifiesto, cuando se revelan las fuerzas y descubrimos la entidad del enemigo. Tenemos control sobre el terreno, sabemos cómo va influir sobre el combate, pero siempre nos queda la incertidumbre de si habremos calculado bien las intenciones del oponente y si podremos superar a sus fuerzas. Es una manera sencilla y elegante de representar la desinformación, caos, mensajes perdidos, incompletos o malinterpretados, todo ello aderezado por el humo de la pólvora acumulado a lo largo del campo de batalla.
Si tengo que poner un “pero” al juego es el tamaño de los cubitos de madera para indicar el control de las áreas, no aptos para mis dedos de “pianista”.
En definitiva, si queremos ser Napoleón o Wellington durante una hora y media o dos horas, no hay mejor opción que Waterloo 200.
Como plus, si hay alguna duda con las reglas, su diseñador, hiperactivo, siempre está dispuesto a resolverla.

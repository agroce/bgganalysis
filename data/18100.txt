Rating based on 1 play.
We taught it to ourselves and it was pretty hard to grasp the scoring mechanisms - we figured them out about half-way through the game.
It was a bit of brain-burner.  With very clever inter-acting scoring mechanisms, that lead to multiple routes to victory (always a good thing).
A bit too abstract for my liking.

Impressive depth considering the ruleset, the size of the board, and the length of the game. China is categorized as an area-control game, but there are actually TWO area-control games going on (provinces and alliances), and they require different strategies. Placing a lone house in a province that you don't win will get you some easy points, but placing a lone emissary in an alliance that you don't win just gives the winner more points. China somehow feels like a light game and a heavy game at the same time.

I rate this marginally lower than web of power, due to the "streamlining" of the rules, but still a fine game. Plays very well under WOP rules - almost as good as the original. The map is certainly friendlier to new players.

Michael Schacht is an enigma to me. He incorporates simple rules, some small twists and exceptions, and out the other side pops an interesting game filled with a variety of interesting strategies and situations. He does this with most of his games, and for this, he's one of my favorite designers.

I really do enjoy China more than Web of Power (although I will keep both). I appreciate the added control that the four face-up cards provide. I also like the fact that houses are scored once. I think this makes the game more well-rounded, as one has to make connections and use their advisors more effectively. The fortifications are so-so for me... I will use them from time to time (or if people request them) but I don't think they are integral to the game. This game is one of the best fillers with depth I've ever played, and I haven't met anyone who speaks poorly of China after playing it.

RATING: 8
This is practically the prototypical "German Game".
- Short playing time
- Short, simple but original rules
- Agonizing decisions at every turn
- Play is abstract, and theme pasted on

As a retheming of Web of Power, China does quite well. The 2-sided board (to better accomodate different numbers of players) is very nice, and the rules changes simplify and streamline the game to a certain extent. The older version was a bit more idiosynchratic... meaning that "knowing" the board was a bigger advantage in that game. China, in comparison, is more evenly balanced (not better, not worse, just a tradeoff).
I'd say it's hard to find a more strategic area control game in such a fast and fun system.

Oh wow! I played China with 4-players, all newbies, including myself. I can totally see why China is totted as the classic area majority game that's relatively short (45-60 min), easy-to-play, with simple yet elegant mechanics. 

And I love the 2-sided board - 1 one side for 3-4 players and the other side for 4-5 players. In fact, I think more games should have 2-sided boards geared for number of players or complexity.

So far, the only issue with China is that the first player is at a huge disadvantage, and maybe even the second player. In a round, you can place 1-2 pieces in a region per turn, but only if 1 house already exists in that region. So, someone has to be the player to add the first house in a region - after that, any player can add 1-2 houses. To maximize the number of pieces you can play on the board, you'd want to place 2 pieces per turn instead of only 1. 

For example, in a 4 player game, the first player must "open" a region by playing a house. The second player can add 1-2 houses to that same region, or, if that player doesn't have to right card combo, they must "open" a new region. The third player now has 2 regions that they can add 1-2 houses to, but if they cannot, they must "open" another region. The fourth player in the round has the greatest likilihood of being able to place 2-pieces, since multiple regions are "open" for this. Now, I can that the best move for the first player is to "open" a small region, thus minimizing the point scoring for the other players. Anyhow, I'm not sure how much this first player disadvantage affects the end result of the game, but it does have a noticeable affect on the first round of play. Still, a minor complaint only, which doesn't really factor into my level of enjoyment.

I only wish that the production value was higher on China - I for one would definitely pay extra for a deluxe version of this game. As it stands, China has a flimsy game box and board, a cheapie cardboard section to hold the pieces, and cards that will deteriorate rapidly with use, ugh! Pluses include nice wooden pieces and fairly good rules. However, since the quality of the components is merely superficial (the game play is not affected), it doesn't affect my overall game rating.

UPDATE: Just reassessing my game list - China is a fantastic introduction to area-control games. I have some new gamer friends and this is the game I'd bring to the table as the gateway area-control game. 2015 UPDATE: we did play this with our gaming group earlier this year. It went decently okay but perhaps too simple for that group. The rules could be better written to be clear and concise.

Excellent game. A healthy dose of area placement strategy (a genre I'm not always that fond of). 

But it plays very quickly because of the limited number of options which the cards present you with on each turn.

Gameplay flows easily with this one, and that is one of the main things I look for in a game.

UPDATE: My wife doesn't like it (despite annihilating us all last time, including the near invincible Doug). Part of the problem may be that it is so hard to assess who is winning - it came as a complete shock to everyone, including herself, when she won. 

So I'm having to drop the rating slightly, because of this and because I don't think it's going to get played that much. 

And I have to admit that it is quite dry.

3-5(3)

This one was over remarkably quickly, and the three of us hadn't filled the board. A really clever (if abstract) set of scoring mechanisms that more greatly punishes overcontrol of houses. In most area majority games overcontrolling is just wasting the cube; here, it's a waste of a cube but also giving more points to second place and opening up emissary slots (which the house-builder is presumably not focusing on in this region). The emissary scoring is pretty significant, but mitigated in that it's all-or-nothing, and that it's sort of difficult to get the necessary majorities. All pretty nice in a quick playing game, though a bit simple and it doesn't look all that great.

Emissaries, emissaries, emissaries.  The one fault with this game compared to its ancestor Web of Power is that emissaries are too strong with the single scoring of houses.  An emissary strategy is a guaranteed winner if no-one seriously opposes you for emissary dominance.  A house/road strategy is a loser by comparison, because you'll always be opposed.  Web of Power had it right when it scored houses twice.  It balanced the two strategies more.

{1 play • 5 players} I like the double-sided board, and the map is more dynamic, road-wise, but I miss the less balanced advisor connections from the original (most were 3's) and the double scoring of regions - both of which allowed for a non-advisor strategy to be viable.  With the newer balanced advisor connections (most are 4's) placing a few seems mandatory for winning, especially now that regions only score once.  In fact, it almost feels like the doubling chip - which I do not care for - was brought in to balance this out.  Even so, this great, original system still shines through.

after giving it another shot, i'm almost left with more questions than answers.  such a bright, well-produced, short, accessible game by an esteemed designer would seem to have something going for it but i can't really find it.  no particular path appears to be dominant, which is good, but the degree to which the game may be tactical is appearing to be a detriment and further dependent upon card draws and other player's actions.  opening up a region goes from questionable to simply sucking, in my mind, and is in need of a fix.  it actually seems too short as well, but i'm not sure how one can develop a longer-term strategy with how static the placement is and how dynamic everything else is.  i'd still try it again, perhaps with the "china erweiterung" expansion that attempts to compensate region opening.  without something like that, i think i'd rather cycle cards on my first turn as the first player.  my suggestion was to mandate that each player open a unique region if possible on their turn.

Scoring is interesting.

3 plays now and I am still liking it.  This game is so fast for the amount of decisions you make, I love it.  You can play one in 20 minutes and feel that it was worthwhile.  This is my type of a filler.  I think this is now worth spending the extra effort to make the Border Fight variant and try it.  I will update again when I play that variant.  I think the way it stands now is very good, but will try the variant.

Area influence, clever but uninspiring. I would rather play Mexica.

I actually traded Mexica and kept China, partly because of the smaller box.

I  feel like if I got the opportunity to play this three times in a row that I could be pretty good at it. A few strategies to try next time: Put first house into bigger regions, don't be first to put house in smaller regions. Keep 2 same cards for a bigger region one card for the smaller region. Don't forget to place emmissaries.

I like the balance of strategy.  There is an interesting way to implement different strategies, but I haven't figured them out yet.  I have only one play in so far, and I'm sure I'll get it a bit more next time.  The family was not exactly amazed after the first play, perhaps when they understand the scoring better they will enjoy it more.  It remains to be seen.

I love this game. I tend to like area control games. I also like games with simplistic rules but deep strategy. This one fits both bills. It's not terribly deep, but it has some good choices to make. The game play is quick and it takes less than an hour. It works well when I'm in the mood for something kinda meaty but don't have a lot of time. I've played with 3 and 4, both on the 3-4 player side of the board. Both worked well.

UPDATE: I played this again twice after it sat on my shelf unplayed for over seven years. It's still a great game. It's easy to explain, it's quick with very little downtime, and there's a tension that builds as you realize that you're running out of time to do what you want to do.

RATING: 7
Jury is still out on whether this is an improvement on Web of Power but they are both great games.
The lack of an interim scoring changes the balance between cloisters and advisors dramaticially, but, there are fewer advisors; so it becomes a case of *where* and *when* to place advisors rather than whether to concentrate on aliances *or* cloisters. 
The fortification is a nice improvement (very similar to the effect of the Vatican in the original expansion)
The lack of a dominant France perhaps makes for a closer and more exciting game, in WOP if you lost the battle for France it could kill your game by the half way point)
Not quite ready to give this a 10 yet, but plenty of lunchtime gaming will soon tell (Hey, this is the first game EVER purchased by one of my colleagues so it is doing something right)

-update - after more plays of this and the original I think it is fair to say that the comments about the lack of a dominant France are just plain wrong. Not only have I won Web of Power many times without a presence in France but in China the game seems somehow soulless, since one place on the map is much like another. Reduced rating.


- update -
Rating getting further separated from Web of Power, somehow the combination of   almost guaranteed jokers and the less varied map take away the fine balance of the masterful original.

Not nearly as good as its predecessor Web of Power. Although the rule changes are subtle, the additions don't add up to a cleaner game. Except for one maybe; Having four cards to choose from instead of three mitigates the bad luck streak you could encounter in Web of Power. For the rest, I would choose Web of Power over China any day, especially in a three player game.

An area control game set in China.  It is a quick game-easy to play-easy to grasp for newbies.

Have now played this about a half dozen times.  It's a fairly light zrea control game.  However, having said that, I've lost the last two times I've played it so maybe it is a bit deeper than I think.  Overall, I'd recommend it because of its short play time (about 30 minutes for 3 players) and simplicity to teach.  It will never be very high on my list but it fits a niche (since it is quick to teach and play and goes from 3 to 5).

 I was thinking of buying this based on other peoples reviews but I am sure glad I got to "try before I buy". This one looks like El Grande in a way but it was a big let down. If I want something light & simple I will chose many others over this. The best thing about it is it doesn't take long.

Update:  I learned the hard way that this game really needs a game master (an experienced player who really knows the rules).  I explained the rules quickly to a group of players -- intelligent people, mind you -- and left them to finish the game I was playing.  Two of these people had played the game before.  Their game of China was rather frustrating for them, as they kept discovering that they were playing it wrong.  (Is this a game flaw -- that it's so natural to want to make moves that are against the rules?) From now on, I'll suggest another game -- or make sure the group always has a GM in it.  

Fun game -- simple rules and options.  Nice bits, cool board.  I prefer to play with 3 players, but it's also good with 4.  If players have unequal ability levels, the player to the left of the weakest player will have an edge. The 2-player variants I have played are not as smooth as the regular game.

This game is a definite improvement to Web of Power.  You don't have to worry about getting the right cards as you do in KuK.  The tighter scoring means a closer game, and often you don't know who has won until the last few alliances are scored.  This game plays much better with 4-5 players, accomodating more chains.  The versatility of the 2 boards is a golden idea, and the game is really well produced, cheap considering its components, and really is quite beautiful.

This is actually a surprisingly good area majority game! It only takes 20-30 minutes maximum, but it doesn't feel like a filler at all; I feel like I have played a "meaty" game when I'm done. It's very simple but the 3 different ways to score points are all interesting and you need a bit of luck but also good tactical skills to win. I really like it and will recommend it to fans of area majority games - it's not El Grande, but it actually works very well with just 3 players (and, unlike El Grande, isn't particularly good with 5). It's one of the best filler games which actually feels like a "real" game; Samurai is the only game which gives me this feeling in an even better way. Highly recommended.

One of the most elegant games I've played.  The rules take 2 minutes to explain for a game that appears to have layers of depth.  The WoW factor for me was the player-imposed population limits on the emissary spaces, which gaurantees a different feel for the regions every play.  The region house scoring is also inspired and unique for an area majority game.

RATING: 9
Seems to have everything.  It's an area control game, which I normally don't like, but it lacks the chaotic messiness of others in the genre.  As you can only place two pieces per turn, the brisk feel somewhat resembles Through the Desert, but with more control.  The tactics are deceptively deep, owing to the clever, yet simple, scoring system.  I love how the scoring incentives drive all of the play to be close in every region.

I've seen China described as a "superfiller," as "El Grande lite," and as "the perfect three player game." It's not El Grande lite in my mind, and the first play was with four players, but it sure is one heck of a super filler. Solid game that lasts 30 to 45 minutes. 

The only complex thing about this game is the scoring, with roads, houses, and emissaries all providing scoring opportunities. The theme is pretty dry, but the gameplay is nice and tense. I bet this gets better as people become more familiar with the game.

Based on the quick playtime alone, this is something I can see dragging around to different game days just to fit in a nice, meaty, quicky game.  

Update: Traded this one away for Maharaja. It's a fine game. But two things convinced me to trade it. I taught it to about 6 or 7 different people, and they all had a collective "meh" reaction. Also, there's no theme. It's a decent game... but just not one that I need to have in my increasingly crowded collection.

I've never played Web of Power but this is a fine game. It is simple and highly accessible, with enough complexiety to keep you going. After 2 or 3 plays this plays in less than 30 minutes, maybe less than 20 and has a very morish feeling. However there is a decent amount of depth and three types of points scoring to consider. Its not a particularly pretty game, but personality is the most important thing, or so they say. All in all this is a quick and easy game with plenty of depth to consider.

(Need to update.)
First two plays without the fortifications and I think there is a really good game in here. Three players seems to be the sweet spot as, with a lot of placement games, things get a bit chaotic if you only get to act every fourth move. Critical to good play is watching carefully the cards your opponents take - something I haven't been doing yet - since reaction in this game is much mightier than action.

RATING: 4
Amazingly elegant little influence game.  Nothing wasted, very little extra.  Quick, simple, not trivial, impressive.   Don't bother playing without the optional fortresses.  They are critical to the game balance now that there are no non-scoring borders.  Advisors (or whatever they are called now) remain the steamroller VP source, but can be overwhelmed by cloister chains with fortresses if care isn't exercised.  (Beware the double whammy of a majority in a big area with a fortress when that fortress is also on a big chain!)  Nice balance there.  The sweet spot is definitely still with three players, but unlike its progenitor Kardinal und Konig, the tail off to four players is mild enough to be tolerated and even enjoyed.  Five players remains far too chaotic to be tolerated with both games.

The Border Fights variant (see Michael's site for the new board and rules) is better than the base game.  This is not to say that the base game is bag, just that the Border Fights version is much better.  At the sacrifice of a little simplicity and elegance considerable depth and challenge are added to good effect.

Forces you to play 2 separate games at once (houses vs. emissaries). 

Opening a region (and being restricted to only one card) is a boon for opponents, who always seem to have the exact cards they need to capitalize, while I have nothing useful in hand. 

I HATE, HATE, HATE THIS GAME.

Hard for me to compare to Web of Power since I have only played that once.  I don't think the differences were significant enough (in my opinion) to pay "out of print" prices for WoP.

As a huge Web of Power fan, I was excited to see it released in this form.  Unfortunately China felt like a simpler/dumbed down version.  I'd urge Web of Power fans to try before buying to see if China is really worth it.  For those who have been wanting Web of Power, but can't find it, China should fit the bill.

RATING: 5
I'm pretty ambivalent about this one. It's fine for what it is, I guess, and I can certainly see how some people could be enthusiastic about it. It's certainly simple and straightforward in its rules and may offer a modicum of depth as players' understanding of the game and its strategies deepens... but as a couple of my group's members commented after our second play, "it's not really our type of game." We spent the rest of the evening playing Fury Of Dracula (and loved it, as usual) because, well, that IS "our type of game."

RATING: 6
For some reason my girlfriend saw fit to buy this game without my okaying the purchase. I suppose it's some form of retribution for me buying Perikles, all at the same fair (Spiel 2008). Still, I wish she'd asked first—we already have Web of Power and that title suffices. Upon playing I found that it indeed resembles that game fairly closely with a slightly more generous card draw mechanic and an easier (read: more gradual) way of scoring points. In WoP, you score two times, which can be a bit brutal; in China, scoring is done as soon as a province is filled up. Hard to say which game is better; they could very well be variants of each other. I think I prefer the original because that has more of a historical meaning for me given the geography.

[b]Update[/b] China rarely makes it to my table: it's been three years since I wrote the above. I still prefer the original because of its more recognisable geography: the map of this game is, to my Western eyes, boring and without any emotional value. It could have been used in a lecture series on the four colour theorem :-). What also bugged me was the use of a more constricted map: with its predecessor there is a bit of incentive play to open up new areas in the endgame which is very pleasurable. That is not to say that on the 3P-map all regions will be used (the final game I played finished with 4 untouched areas!), but still. Finally, the double city scoring meant that there was a bit of time pressure too, which is lacking from this version of the game. Once a region is done, you can safely forget about it; in the original there is ever-present tension not to start lagging too far behind.

It is easy to back-port the rules of Web of Power to China, although the map topology is different, of course, so it might not be such a good idea to play China according to those rules in the first place. But still, I'm inclined to give the nod to the older game. The later game is slightly off in a little too many spots.

[b]Update 2[/b] With Web of Power in my collection there really is no need to own this game. Sold off.

I have now played this game 3 times.  I didn't really enjoy it the first couple of times, not because I got totally beat down, but rather I couldn't figure out how to control what was going on.  I finally won the game on the last play, although mainly because I was playing with newer players.  Overall not a bad game, just not one of my favorites.  I will play it again though.

RATING: 9
The more I play this, the more I like it.  Do not lose sight of each region's emissary limitations as the houses get placed.  The key in the game would seem to be a combination of getting involved in enough of the area scorings, but not all of them - which spreads yourself too thin AND getting at least one long road built.  If you do not simultaneously maintain at, or close to a majority with at least some of the emissaries the game will get away from you.  If you don't have a long road you may come close, but it is unlikely you will win.

Initial rating after only one play, but I like it. My only concern is whether the game will have any kind of legs to it or if after several plays I've had my fill. But I got it used (thanks Justin!), so it certainly won't be a case of not getting my money's worth.

Plays *very* quick, but thinky nonetheless. My friend Dodd put it best: "It plays like what you hoped Clans was supposed to be." I agree, but at least Clans can play with two out of the box. Not sure I'd want to play China with a necessary two-player variant.

A great game, always love to play.  A good 'between' game that if players are familiar with it can be played in 20 min.  I like the how fortresses add a new dimension.  Web of Power/China are always welcome at any session I'm in.  China gets a slight edge in my rating due to the addition of fortresses and the double sided board.

Truely a remake of WoP with differences nearly all of which could be played in the original.  The double sided board is probably the only hard difference.  If you can't get a copy of WoP then get this.  China is probably a little easier to teach just because of how the board is designed.  Some of the scoring feels a bit simpler for new players to grasp however first timers still seem to miss out on the emmissary strategy.  That is so often where the game is won or lost.

China feels similar to games like Thurn and Taxis or Ticket to Ride. While there are many similarities, the way you place tiles and score is considerably different.

This isn't a bad game, I just like the way the other games go about placing tiles and scoring better. There is not as much tension or excitement in the game China and it feels very abstract.

The game isn't any quicker or any simpler to play, for me nothing STOOD OUT.

So while it plays ok, and is different enough for fans of this style to get, it just doesn't feel as good as other similar games out there and I would rather play them.

Another game that is very much my type of game because while seemingly simple, it's pretty nuanced and largely dependent on how your opponents play the game. In ways, it reminds me of Through the Desert and Aton, where you might think you know exactly how how to win, but there are plenty of checks and balances to each strategy.

A nice filler game.  Interesting mechanics, and a game length that is self-limiting - just twice through the card deck and the game's over.  Plus, it has purple pieces in the basic game - no need to get an expansion!  Wouldn't mind owning this one, but it requires at least 3 players. Too bad.

China was introduced to me on the same day as Power Grid. Unfortunately, its impression was a bit less favorable. It is not that I actively dislike it, it is just that I do not find it especially fulfilling as a game. It was a fine area control game, but didn't really seem to be interesting enough to play again. I like other area control games better, and though it fills the "light area control game" niche well, I am not sure a light area control game is really something I want or need

RATING: 7
Essentially a remake of Kardinal und Koenig/Web of Power - one of the best 30-45 minute 3+ player games out there.  Not a lot has changed here.  Players draft cards to place a piece(s) into a region.  Fill the region and score it.  Alternatively, go for advisors to set up a chain of adjacent region scorings.  New rules are more cards on selection, each region only scores once, and the powerful fortresses (that double scoring for the owning player).  No need to own both, but either well worth owning.

Bár pár éve sokat játszottunk vele, az utóbbi időben nem nagyon került elő, de tegnap újra: így azt kell mondjam méltatlanul mellőztük.
Igaz csak egy 3 fős partit játszottunk, de érdekes, izgalmas volt végig, és hát a játékidő sem volt végtelen.
Eleve szeretem a szerzőt, és valszeg ezért: a játékai könnyedebbek, de mégsem túl könnyűek, van bennük izgalom kihívás, és ha csak kis ideje van az embernek, akkor is le lehet melléjük ülni. Itt is a játék maga nagyon egyszerű szabályok köré épül, elmagyarázni is max 5 perc, ugyanakkor sok lehetőséget rejt.
Update: újra előkerült, és most 5 személlyel, zsúfolt  apálya, és ettől érdekes, másképp kell gondolkozni, h mire s h jut idő, kártya. Ugyanakkor még 5 fővel is gyors játék: max 1 óra, de nekünk ezúttal szabály magyarázattal együtt sem volt annyi.
Update2: Még mindig igen kiváló. Az alapjáték egyszerű, ygors, de érdemes 2 ingyen kieget használni hozzá, amit már anno is megállapítottam: a kiegészítő néven lévő, s színt, ami ad 6 pontot az adott színből legtöbbet gyűjtőnek: nagy értelme, h a tartomány megkezdését vonzóbbá teszi (alapban kevéssé vonzó, hisz csak 1-et lehet letenni, plusz megnyitja a követ lehetőségeket). És elég jó a nagykövetségek kieg is: ezzel egy adott tartományon jó játékos hozhat nekem is pontokat.

China is very similar to Web of Power.

I also played Web of Power. I prefer the latter if I had to choose which one to buy. Too bad Web of Power is out of print. It doesn't really mean China is a bad game, I just prefer the scoring of Web of Power better than China.

There is two changes in China when comparing with Web of Power. Scoring is different. The other is number of cards which are face up besides the draw deck. Also, the map is different, no surprises there.

The game is a little random due to the cards you might get. Get a card you don't want or need could slow you down. Plays rather fast when you know how to play. It's an interesting area control game. Emissaries plays an important role in the game.

Got it in a game trade.

UPDATE: We pulled this game off the shelf for a Chinese New Year-themed game night and we really enjoyed it. I feel that some of the rules are a bit hard to explain, but one you get over that hump, everyone seemed to like it.

A revised and slightly improved version of the older majority control game Web of Power. I think that the rules improvements and the extra board are different enough to merit owning both. Since Web of Power is really hard to get now, I strongly suggest this game.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy how quick this game is.  It almost feels like Ticket to Ride crossed with an Area Control game.  I say this because you use cards in your hand to place pieces on the board and it's best to try to connect your houses in a route of 4 houses or more in a row for bonus end of game scoring.  When you refresh your hand of cards you have the option of taking a face up card or one from the draw deck which is also reminiscent of TTR.  The colors of this game are a little in your face, but other than that, they work just fine.  Overall you have a quick experience with some meaningful decision and that suits me just fine.

Superb game considering its depth and playing time of around 30 minutes especially with 3 players.  5 is a bit too chaotic but still worth playing if you want depth and a short playing time.  Smart emissary play is critical and usually determines the winner in the games I have played although you can't ignore roads and well placed houses.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
This game gets extra points because it packs a decision-rich game into a 45 minute playing time.  I've not played Web of Power, for the record, but I suspect I'd like this better based on descriptions of the differences from friends.

RATING: 8
A great three player game. And to think that the consensus is that WoP is better. Dang. Can't turn down a high-ranked Tanga purchase. 

More plays confirm that this is a really really good game. I feel that the rating will never get higher though, because everything that I find endearing about the game is diminished at 4 or more players. 

China is my golden standard 3 player game, as it exemplifies what I'm most fond of in that setting. The game plays rapidly, the turns come around fast, and there's always rich choices for players.

Good strategy game. Plenty of strategic options to choose from. It should have a higher rating but it doesn't. Why? For a game about gaining "influence" over ancient China, it's over so quickly there's no real chance to savour the majesty of it all. In that sense, it suffers from the same problems of Attika. Has a cold and clinical feel to the gameplay and not much interaction between players.

[1 play] Played this late at night and in a confused state; figured by the time the game was over I might figure out what the strategy ought to have been, and that sort of happened.

A taut rippling affair in which Michael Schact has taken some venerable mechanisms and honed them into something utterly inconsequential and uninteresting.  I did have trouble understanding the scoring, but I suspect further plays will make my rating go down, and not up.

RATING: N/A
Classic area control game, especially good with 3 players

China is a welcome reimplementation of Web of Power that makes only a few small changes to streamline things, while preserving what was good about the original. Given how easy it is to learn and how quick it is to play, it offers a remarkable range of options and interesting choices for scoring points that will require players to think carefully about their decisions, without burning their brain. The clever scoring system will keep players engaged throughout the game, and features a perfect and satisfying blend of luck, tactics, and strategy. This is a wonderful and sleek design, that especially shines as a three player game, and can rightly be considered one of the very best area control games you'll find for its length and weight. A brilliant game and a modern classic, China is a game we can expect to see gamers still playing many years from now.

RATING: 7
A much better game than you'd expect for a simple game of colors and area control. And a very engaging game for how short it is. Seems to play well at different player counts too. Happy to have for that "one more short game before calling it a night" type game. 

The decision points are deceptively difficult. It's so tempting to stop doing something and go do something else, but you're much better off trying to do a few things well than several things mediocrely. You can only place one piece in a territory that isn't open yet so you frequently open up areas for the rest of the table. While that sounds -- and is -- vulnerable, with some subtle timing, you can do it when others are too busy to be bothered with starting something new. The player who can slip through being the least noticeable will probably win, and this game. Think of it as an exercise in How Not To Be Seen. Whatever you do, don't stand up!

I wish I could get more plays out of this one - everyone I've showed it to so far just doesn't 'get' the game, especially the part with the alliances.

RATING: 8
All the familiar trappings of Web of Power but in a different setting.  There are two maps which make for more crowded games with less players.  The fortifications seem to make the house and road scoring significantly  more important than the advisors.  Next time we'll play without them.
Update: Disregard my comment when playing with 5 as it becomes increasingly difficult to yield insane scores while everyone is competing for areas.  I upped my rating as this as become a major hit at the office lunch hour game.

On my first play, I won without placing any emissaries and generally not knowing what was happening.  I felt a little guilty.  (Not really.)

Really good, quick and easy to get into.  China is becoming a favorite with me.  It's a great length to start a game night with and it's not like many of the other games we play. I'm happy to own it and I'm just learning how to play it well.  It's a game I always want to play a second time as we're putting it away. Love the colorful bit's too.  Web of Power beats it due to the European map, which feels less symmetrical and a bit more interesting to me.

China is sufficiently different from K&K that different strategies have to be adopted.  The main differences in this regard are house scoring (only once per region instead of twice as it was with cloister scoring) and fortresses (which double a player's score in the region/on the road placed).

A slight reworking of Web of Power. Only significant differences:

1. Card distribution is a little different.
2. China has no mid-game scoring.
3. China uses 4 face-up cards instead of 2.
4. Board spaces are arranged differently.
5. The game has fortifications which allow for double scoring in a region.

I have a SLIGHT preference for Web of Power due to the mid-game scoring, but I like China's use of 4 face-up cards instead of Web of Power's 2 face-up cards.

Personally, I mix the two, taking the best of both worlds and playing Web of Power with 4 face-up cards.

China is pretty much the same game as Web of Power with a few small tweaks. Some of them seem like a good idea (more cards to choose from, fortifications), some of them I liked better in the old version (intermediate scoring, not scoring every border). Overall it pretty much evens out, and the game remains a very quick area majority game with quite a bit to offer for its length.

Schacht.  Good area control game that plays in under an hour or so.  Prob best as a three-player.  Theme is less than paper-thin.  This is a dry-as-a-bone abstract.  Some people like the bright color scheme.  I find it gaudy, annoying and cheap-looking, especially compared to contemporary classy euro titles like Hansa, Thurn & Taxis, Thebes, etc.  I always have to do a double-take looking at the washed-out red cards to tell them apart from the orange ones.  Good brain burner that doesn't drag on too long, though.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple, almost abstract card game with board. Multiple scoring routes, and the trick is balancing those routes, cutting off your opponents and sneaking in for points without even trying. Turns come fast and decisions are easy but critical. A signature Shacht game!

Probably not quite as good as Web of Power, but still not bad. Has a high suckage factor when you keep setting up the guy after you and being screwed by the guy before you. I'm trading it away because I just don't like the China theme as much as I like the Web of Power theme.

Excellent area control game that combines some really great features: great bits, simple rules free of ambiguity, scales well from 3 to 5, two different board surfaces, differing paths to victory, and quick playing.  I consider this game one of the "jewels" of my collection, and I fail to finish first more often than not.

RATING: 7
While I like the double-sided map (making the game tight with any number of players), the 4 card draw line makes it too easy to draw jokers without thinking/planning. I'm 50/50 about only scoring the provinces once... it's cleaner & easier to teach, but it removes a subtle subset of decisions that can majorly influence the score of the game. I'd like to try the Border Fights map, though. All in all, it was better than I thought it would be but not good enough to replace Web of Power.

Games played fast and easy to learn.  There is definitely strategy, but the strategy is prone to be 1) limited by the luck of the draw of cards, and 2) ruined by the fickleness of other players' decision.  Every game turned out to be a bit of a surprise so far.  Multiple paths to points and victory makes it a game worth studying.  Will definitely play agian, but the jury is still out for me on this game.

And in spite of its dryness and rather abstract character I enjoyed playing it. Definitely worth having. Especially considering the size of the box - it fits literally everywhere :-)

A great quick area control game that is a reworking of the Out of Print game "Web of Power."  Aside from a different map, there are two major differences between the two.  The interim scoring is handled differently, and in Web of Power only 2 cards are face up next to the draw deck, instead of 4.  There is plenty of debate as to which game is better, but honestly, I think China is fine if you can't find the original.  China does have the benefit of 2 boards to play on, depending on the number of players.

I'm not sure how a game this simple grips me so strongly.

I love the tug of the desire to spend your turn improving your own house-lines, against the need to spend it blocking an opponent's line.

Then there's the fear of opening up a new territory (allowing only a single house placement), in case an opponent instantly cuts you off, thus making you lose a piece placement [i]and[/i] the  opening you sacrificed it for.

And finally there's the impossible-to-pinpoint period where you sense that maybe you should start laying out the emissaries now, and instantly everybody is conflicted between getting an early start on the emissary influence, or mopping up those last juicy points left hanging in the empty house spaces.

I find this satisfying to play. When I win, I feel like I earned it every time. Yet despite being pulled by conflicting interests throughout, I also find it inexplicably relaxing to play. Maybe it's the primary colours.

RATING: 7.5
A fine design, easy to teach and play. One balance problem: fortifications may be devastating, especially if you manage to build a long string of houses, but fortunately they are optional. I've played its predecessor "Web of Power" just once, but I believe it was slightly better. I disliked the ugly and garish new board, and I especially hate that all the provinces have the same symbol, but those are minor issues. The game has a pretty good level of strategy for the short playing time.

RATING: 8
This one is more interesting to me every time I play.  Some people have trouble wrapping their head around the emissary scoring.  I prefer to play with the optional fortification piece as it adds more flexibility to the game.

A rather 'ok' area majority game.  I just don't see it offering anything to the genre that I can't get with games that are more interesting to me.

Also, while I don't mind luck affecting the outcome, the card draw luck seems to limit your ability to even try.

[Initial Impression: 8]
An area-influence game that combines scarcity of resources with tense choices among compelling alternatives.   There are restrictions on entering new regions, and on each turn pieces may be placed in only a single region.  This means that you're constantly agonizing over how to use your cards to play into a region that will best expand your influence while limiting that of others.  The "advanced" version is simple enough to be included from the first play, and adds an additional decision point with the fortifications. Some of the governing rules seem somewhat arbitrary,  but you rapidly get used to them and can begin to appreciate their elegance.

RATING: 7
Played my first game of China back-to-back with a game of Web of Power, and I found the changes interesting.

The mid-game scoring of houses doesn't take place, which should make the emissary options more potent, but this didn't seem to happen, because of the greater difficulty chasing chains and applying the fortification point double onto a high-scoring chain/into a high-scoring province.

Consequently, even though some players in the 1st solo (5 player) game focused on the emissary stratagem the winner was a player who almost ignored emissaries, but used their fortification in a way that both doubled a large winning province and a decent length chain.

I think I like the extra options, but I'm not sure if didn't like the European map better somehow.

Still a meaty area control game, in the Far East or Western Europe.

Interesting area control game.  Is it fun, though?  The jury is out on that.  Seems kind of dry to me.  It is certainly a pretty game and easy to play.  Probably not my type of game.

What a great game.  It possesses incredibly simple mechanics, but institutes a very clever scoring system that rewards flexible players who can adapt their overall strategy to whats going on around them.  And best of all? It does it in right around 45 minutes.  I've played primarily  with 4 and 5 players, and a few with 3.  I have heard 3 player is far superior to the 4 and 5 player games and will have to make an effort to play it more often with 3.  My favorite game to date (9/07).

Really interesting idea; the game is mostly about limiting how many points you are giving other people. Glad I picked this one up. After six plays, I still don't really understand the strategy--but that makes it interesting.  Schacht is a genius.  For serious.

Fortifications definitely add and interesting strategic element while decreasing the power of the emissaries.  I like this variant quite a bit.

A fast paced territory control game.

The different ways of scoring add subtle depth and the fast play time make this a game that can be played anytime.

Area majority game where you score majorities in regions, continuous roads (4+ houses), and alliances between regions (majority in ambassadors).  Adding a fortification to a house allows double points.  Collect cards ticket to ride style but with a maximum hand size of 3 cards, automatically refill at end of turn.  Theme is pasted on.

Excellent gateway game with a pleasantly thinky element allowing seasoned gamers to enjoy this as well.  Plays much better than I initially thought it would (a keeper).

Dec08: For now, China ranks as a "just above okay" game for me. It was a little rough to explain to family, but it went over pretty well. What did I think of it?

Pros:
Takes under an hour to play.
Turns are short, you are restricted by your cards, but the cards don't play you.
Decisions are interesting, the "best" plays aren't obvious.
The bits look nice.

Cons:
Yellow and Orange are way too similar.
With the rules as written, the emissaries seem like *the* way to win.
There isn't much synergy between the theme and the rules.
It didn't have that much of the elusive "fun" to it.

Mar12:

Got it again.  Would still be rough to teach the family.  The colors are still screwed up.  But I've come to enjoy area majority/control games more and this is a solid version.  Have to stress the emissaries more to new players.

China for me fell very flat but maybe that was because I was expecting a game rather than a filler, I also came to it in 2011 after playing 600 other games rather than when it was released. Its also themeless but that is only a slight knock in this genre and it reminds me of Hansa in many ways also by the same designer and also fell very flat for me. 

For a filler its not bad really, WAY too dependant on luck however (even with the 2 card rule) and about 10 - 15 minutes too long (though more play might speed it up if I was interested in more play). Its VERY basic which for a game is typically bad but for a filler more acceptable and it does have 3 ways to score which was good and its most redeeming quality. Play is quick as there is not much to think about, so thats good and bad. Maybe my play with 4 ran a touch longer than it would with 3 but this is a 6 tops for me likely, you just play to the cards you are dealt with what openings are on the board, near autopilot level of thinking.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2013)

I was surprised by this game. When it was explained to me it seemed like a very boring endeavor, however the game is very interesting and fun. I have only played with the basic rules

On the plus side, the game can be explained very quickly, the play time is very short so it doesn’t get boring. The pieces look very nice on the board. I also feel there is a low luck factor (a good thing for me) as there are few colors and you can always draw from the open pile, however sometimes this luck can screw you. This makes the game a lot more tactical, long term planning can be difficult to do. The game has more depth than it is initially apparent. I also dig that there are a plethora of maps out there to try

On the bad side the game has paper thin theme so I feel gameplay can be dry.

China is a good (light medium) area control game, one I will play again in and perhaps I will buy it. Still not a game I would want to play a lot but from time to time.

Not one of my favorites.  Cards restrict and add a random element without adding interest the way most restrictions do in games.  This is stripped down area control, which area control fans will like.  For me, I need extraneous bits and mechanics to overcome my annoyance with area control, and those don't exist in this title.  Ultimately I'm just not willing to expend the effort to play this game well.

Simple but elegant Euro - both in terms of looks and mechanisms.

As you can't do much on your turn, the fewer the players the better - some of the opportunities you set up will still be there on your next turn. 

Because of this I'd recommend it for 3 (when it shines as quick and tense) but no more. I played with 5 and it fell flat, all you can do is make the most of what the other 4 have left you on your turn.

There are a variety of ways of scoring. Best not to let one player monopolise the emissaries, he'll scoop big points.

Quick little area majority game. With more than one thing to play for in each province (majority of houses and emissaries), it felt a little like [gameid=475]. 

I'm not sure how much strategy there is, other than that I got the sense that you want to hold off on competing for emissaries as long as possible. 

The components weren't anything to write home about. Pretty unremarkable on balance...I can't think of any situations where I'd be itching to play this ahead of something else, especially Taj since it's so similar.

RATING: 7
Revised Web of Power with the changes being in the way things are scored and a doubling piece that can be played under a cloister. I need another play before determining the impact of the scoring changes.

Okay, the scoring changes are huge. In Web the regions score twice so houses played there in round 1 pay off twice, this is not the case in China.

Instead in China there are now multiplier discs that can be built. If a player can build one and get his house on it which isn't too hard the region the house is in scores double for him. In addition if the house is included in a chain, that chain scores double points. As a result of this I've seen less play of the advisers in China as players are looking to build the houses with multipliers. 

I'm not convinced that these changes have made the game better but they have made the game different. I do like the fact they give you a double sided board and really you could play using Web of Power rules with this game which is nice.

I'm learning that Michael Schacht is the king of abstract games that come in themed boxes.

In a word, China is lean. Players spend 30-45 minutes fighting for area majorities on a map while also building contiguous chains and positioning to win adjacent provinces. The three-fold scoring creates a raw tension that's easy to appreciate. The lack of narrative/theme would be unacceptable in a longer game of this type, but China delivers a lot of gameplay in a compressed time-frame. I'll bite.

I really like this game! This remake of Web of Power changes very little about the game aside from the map. It is an area majority game, but it's a lot more exciting than just that.  There are two coupled games of area majority going on (cities and region centers), as well as VP being earned for chains of cities.

It is a great game, I highly recommend it.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating which could go either way. It appears to have that excellent combination which is simple rules and depth of play. Lots of chaos but very little randomness. I need to play it several more times before I decide just how much I like it - at this point I don't feel like I have a good feel for how to approach it, nor have I played with opponents who do.

Given to me by my wife on our 20th wedding anniversary (for which the traditional gift is china - took me a while to make the connection though). We were unimpressed by our first (2-player) go, but having played now with 4 and 5 players I like it much more. Nice and quick, cute little bits.

This game feels closely related to Clans and it interests me to a similar extent. I felt it was very dry, and calculation heavy. There is some luck that could have a significant impact. The choices available seem very similar in terms of optimisation. The game components are beautiful though the board is a little garish. It plays quickly and the impending end is predictable, there's no catching up. It is language independant, the only text is for matching.

UPDATE: Coming back to this after a break and expecting less of it I enjoyed the game, though for the luck factor it needs to be kept fairly short.

See my comments for Web of Power. This is mostly same, but the scoring has been streamlined a bit and luck has been reduced a bit. The European map was more interesting than the block of China. I think this is mostly a 4- or 5-player game. The fortifications turned out a nice addition, although a bit dependent of the luck of draw.

RATING: 9
Excellent game.

  Like Tikal, a constant balance of many options, many involving  controlling a territory by having the most guys in it.  Unlike Tikal, choices are constrained by which cards you have available.  More luck involved than with Tikal, and simpler too (fewer possible choices than in Tikal).

Good gateway game.

Web of Power is my favorite game, but this one isn't quite as perfect for me.  I like the visual presentation of Web better, and the 4 card display seems to remove some of the tension compared with the 2 card display in Web.  I do like having the game in the same size box as Hansa and Paris Paris, however!

The real strength of this "mini" area control game is how much punch you get out of the time frame it's played in.

2015-05-31 - 7.5 - Good, quick area control game, which is not similar to El Grande IMO. I played it twice so far and the funny thing is that the second time it seemed very different from the first game, as we knew more what we were doing. The rules are simple but it takes a little while to fully comprehend what is going on.

2015-08-01 - 7.5->7 - Advanced rules are rather unnecessary. It's a good game for quick three players game, but will not be my first choice.

I bought this from Tanga without knowing anything about it. When I read the rules, I was was sorry I had gotten it. It is almost a no-luck perfect-knowledge game, and I don't tend to like games without some random chaos (to potentially save me when I inevitably make some dumb mistakes).It therefore took me a long time to bother trying the game. In the end, I finally did, and I have to say this. It's an attractive game, and more enjoyable to play than I had imagined. Sure, I'll lose because of my inevitable dumb mistakes, but it's short enough that it's not such an issue.

Here is why I love China: it is an available edition of Web of Power, which is a definitive Michael Schacht design that I loved in its earlier incarnation, as "Kardinal & Konig".  Some say China is even better, mechanically, with the double-sided board, and fortress pieces.

Here is why I dislike China: the graphic design -- the colors are absolutely lurid, and not even that evocative of ancient China enough to be worth it.  Also (and this really really bothers me), the names on the map are utterly made up.  To me, it feels as if the mapmaker write "Ching-Chong-Chang" while snickering at how "Chinese" s/he could make the places sound.

There is just too much information to analyse. You must check the whole board since you can play anywhere, and you must keep track of who picked which card to plan where they want to play.

This game plays pretty quick.  It is a majority control game where you place out temples to score a province.  You collect cards to place these temples out and often the cards allow you to place in two locations.  You can place more than one temple if you have more than one card of the same color.  

You can also put out these people that if you have the majority in two adjacent districts you get the points based on the total number in both areas.  

It is not a filler, but has a filler feel.  Game should take about 30-45 minutes.  I liked it but not really impressed by it.  I would not object to playing again.

Nice rating. 

Tom speaks well of it, but regarding fun he says: "I think the reason that Web of Power and China aren't in my top ten are simply a lack of "fun." Don't get me wrong, these abstract games are very good, quick, strategic games to play with people, but they lack an element of fun. New players are often confused, and sometimes only understand the finer points of the game after the first game has finished. I will gladly play a game of China any time - I'm just not sure I'll always remember it. Still, the game is excellent enough to rate an "8.5" out of 10 on my scale."

Accordingly, this is not high on the "To Buy" list.

Excellent remake of 'Web of Power' - area/majority control and hand management with some neat scoring twists that is fun to play and only takes  about 20 minutes.

While not exactly like Web of Power, it has enough similarities to make learning how to play it rather easy.  It seems most of the rule issues of WoP have been ironed out, making for a cleaner game that plays faster.  While it will probably never be a Top 10 contender, it will get semi-regular table time.

RATING: 8
A lot of room for 'strategery' in this game.  Board and components very colorful.

House 2-player variant:
1) The Emperor gets a turn at the end of each round (e.g.: P1, P2, Emperor).
2) Players alternate who plays for the Emperor. 
3) The Emperor may only play one piece.
4) The Emperor may NOT play into a new territory unless he is unable to do anything else. 
5) The Emperor does not have a hand of cards--player draws a card from top of deck to play for the Emperor.

These rules are similar to the official 2-p variant (China Das Duell), but simplified so you don't have to add any elements to the brilliant gameplay.

7 JUNIO 2005: Recién llegado de gamefest.com y esperando jugar por primera vez.
UPDATE: el mismo 7 de junio lo he jugado por primera vez, con mi polola. Me parece bueno, pero es necesario jugarlo con 4-5 jugadores para ver su potencialidad.
Me gusta que el factor suerte esté limitado o sea controlable.
1 JULIO 2005: se baja a 6, desde 7, porque no es ni un entretenido filler ni un juego de mucha estrategia. La táctica es bastante obvia y limitada.
12 julio 2005: sube de 6 a 8. Claro, sigue siendo 8 un juego rápido, pero en verdad compite con Coloretto y similares. Y en eso lo hace muuy bien. Las tácticas son claras: caminos, mayorías o emisarios. Pero la combinación de eso es lo que difiere en cada jugador. A un filler no se le puede pedir mucho más.
Le seguiré dando oportunidades.
set. 05: baja a 7, para adecuarlo con el resto de mis calificaciones.

A quite fun abstract game with tons of different maps to play. At first the victory points system feels strange, but after a few plays you get the idea. There are three ways to score: territory, alliances and roads. All of them can be decisive in each game, depending on the players choices. The rules are really tight.

A kinder, gentler, area majority game. Ties counting as majorities and a bit of the luck-of-the-draw with the card deck keep things light, but there's a nice amount of thought involved. This isn't a brain-burner, but there are opportunities for clever play within its simple rule-structure. Smooth-playing, quick to explain, and a short play time--a keeper!

The "modern" version of Web of Power (which is out of print).  I always loved Web of Power so my feelings for China are not any different.  In fact, China makes a few small changes that make the game better.

03/14/06 Played a four player game, once. I liked it OK. I'd play it again. 

The cards not exactly matching the province colors irritated me, and caused some confusion. Why they used colors (red, orange, gold) so close together on the color wheel is beyond me. If the color match between the cards and provinces was off, and the provinces were instead something like red, gray, tan, green and purple, no confusion would have been possible.

I played it for a second time; four player. Its worn out its welcome. I'm lowering my rating from a 7 to a 5. It just doesn't click with me. I doubt I'll play it again. I now find it tedious.

A deceptively simple-playing game where the scoring is the mechanism that catches people out.

Dry, dry, dry. I hate games were I get the feeling that I could 'solve' for the best solution/action if only I'd sit down and thought about for 5-10 minutes. I hate that feeling because I hate spending that much time analyzing one move (and don't like playing with those who do). This game gives me that feeling on  every single turn . In fact it probably wouldn't be too hard to distill the game to a linear equation that solves for most points.

This is a pure area-influence game wherein players build houses or emissaries in different regions of China.  This has enjoyable inter-player dynamics (no bidding or trading, but much competition for limited board spaces), relatively light (and fast) gameplay, yet is surprisingly strategic.  Players can get points by either having the most houses in a region or by building emissaries, and both strategies can be successful.  This is the first area influence game I played; this is much simpler than games like Louis XIV, El Grande, and Leonardo da Vinci, but is still great fun.

RATING: 7
The game is one full notch above a filler game for me.  The rules are easy to explain and game play is short.  I find myself grabbing it when I am taking a stack of game somewhere with me.  I wish the color scheme for the board was appealing.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple placement and area-control type game where players take turns playing cards and placing pieces on a map of China to try and gain the most influence in an area thus earning them points. Naturally, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. Rules are very simple and easy to understand and the pieces and board is well done. Overall, the game plays pretty smoothly and there’s plenty of opportunity for strategy. This game somewhat feels like it is “Through the Dessert’s” bigger brother and falls in the same vein for me. A nice placement/area-control game, not too heavy on the strategy and not terribly prone to analysis paralysis either. It’s a fun light-medium game that doesn’t have too much conflict and very little player interaction.

RATING: 6
I've played a number of games recently that are mind-numbingly simple at first but show their teeth by the end. China is another one, seeming to play itself for a while, but once that board gets filled a little, interesting decisions arise. Reminiscent of Taj Mahal and Through the Desert, it's got three basic ways to score that all counter-balance with each other. The game is primarily tactical, since you can't do a whole lot about the cards available to you, and what you can do probably isn't worth the cost over just making the best of what you have. Still, it's got that "retroactive strategy" feel to it, where everyone ends up sliding into different focus areas and really try to close the door on some key aspect of scoring before the game comes to a close.

The downside is that it is pretty dry, and gamers on the casual side of things might not get very excited by this title. I'm not sure it offers a whole lot more than Through the Desert, which goes faster and lacks the randomness of the cards. But 45-minute, easily explained, fairly interesting games aren't a bad category to have some variety in, and China seems to be an admirable addition to the mix.

China is a beautiful area control game on three levels: in regions, along roads and across borders. The cards restrict your actions and forces you to plan ahead while the fortifications are a one time investment where you only get one chance to find the most profitable spot. China can be placed both silently and with aggressive diplomacy where regions are divided through negotiations and backstabbing. All this come with simple rules and short playing time.

RATING: 5
China is a quick game that still retains an interesting level of strategy, which sets it above other such filler type games.  The card drawing adds an interesting element of luck that makes the games fairly varied, and I like that it forces players to cooperate and compete at the same time.

I do have some concerns that players will begin to play exactly the same way in all regions, as this has started to happen.  The last times I've played, each player has placed one house and one advisor into a region (once it has been opened) to guarantee themselves the majority of both houses and advisors.  If this continues to be the dominant strategy, the game comes down to luck of the draw, and will drop in the rankings.  Until that becomes the case, I still consider it to be a good game.

A reprint of Web of Power with the following differences: 1) areas are only scored once when they are complete 2) once during the game, a person has the option to play a fortress which doubles their road net and area points, in the location placed, 3) there are four face up cards to choose from, and 4) the map is changed so the alliances are more balanced. There is more emphasis on advisors in this version, and it is just as fun. If you have the original, I don't feel you need this version.

During my gameplay, I realized that I prefer the original edition. The intermediate scoring in the original game provides a sense of surprise to the game - that is, if you are not good at counting and remembering scores like me. Although this edition has a separate board for 5 players, it still fill up quite quickly and feels crowded. Go for the 3 player game, which is very hard to beat.

Supremely elegant area control game that has aged beautifully. I can't quite say which of its variants I prefer, but I suspect that Web of Power is my favorite.

RATING: 8
Based on two 3-player games.  If this plays as well with 4 or 5 as it does with 3 it'll easily get bumped up to 9.  A rare game of area control where you don't feel you completely lost when something gets snatched out from under you.  So far roads seem too difficult to capitalize on and emissaries are too potent - but I forsee at least the latter being self-correcting as the players learn their importance.

--update--
A note to future designers - China gets scoring for area control right!  All investments are rewarded, rather than some investments being totally wasted with little recourse for the player.

RATING: 6
Quick-playing quasi-abstract. An unusual scoring mechanism for an area majority game means it's often worth it to be a distant second place in any one area. However, it is crucial to have sole or share of majority when it comes to emissaries. It is card-driven, but the card turnover and plenitude of face-up options strongly mitigate luck of the draw factor. Overall, it suffers from being a bit too boring, even considering its compact game length.

RATING: 7.25
It's an old game that I bought because in spite if its simplicity, I have read very good critics. But I didn't try it and as time went by, my interest in it dropped, to the point that I was almost convinced to sell it just before trying it.

But I finally played it and liked quite a bit. 

It offers you many possibilities and yet, the gameplay is really fluid.

I usually hate area control games, but the effect in this one is mitigated because all players score points, and there's not a huge difference between all of them. You don't waste your houses just because the other player has more than you, you just don't maximize its effectiveness. 

You can finish a fast 3 players game in 30 minutes, and this is great. I have not played with 4-5 players, but I don't recommend it. It will mean much less control over what's happening on the board, longer games and the area control effect will be much more harsh.

First impression: As it is a new version of [gameid=491]. with some small rules changes and doublesided map. I haven't played original enough to say how it affects the game.

A rock-solid abstract which, critically, doesn't give you too many things to think about. Essentially, there is only one rule, but the choices the designer is able to propagate from that rule are complex without being slow. Sadly, it all feels a little clinical and sterile compared to its predecessor, Web Of Power. Not great with more than 3.

A game to which I can apply one of my highest accolades: Knizian. The house scoring system is inspired (leader gets points for total number of houses, 2nd place gets number of 1st place's houses, 3rd gets 2nd and so on) and I'm surprised it hasn't been pilfered for other games (or has it? let me know!). And then on top of that is another beautifully elegant mechanic: the emissaries, which are cleverly limited by the houses. The card selection gives just enough uncertainty to the play and overall the game feels like it packs a lot more into 30-40 minutes than it has any right to.

China is a reimplementation of Web of Power, one of the very first area majority games.  On a player's turn, he can use cards to either place houses or emissaries in regions based on the color card played.  Each region can only hold so many houses, and each spot for a house is connected to a road.  When all the house spots are gone, the region scores, provided points equal to the total number of houses for first place, points equal to the first place player's number of houses for second place, points equal to the second place player's number of houses for third, and so on.  At the end of the game, points are also scored for road segments occupied by a single player that are at least four long, as well as emissaries, which score the total number of emissaries for any two adjacent regions in which a player has majorities on both sides.  This light game is a good introduction to area control.  It plays very quickly, but you still have lots of interesting choices to make on each turn.  I do wish the board weren't so garish.

I really enjoy this game - have played it twice now with a mixed group, and half of us liked it. Pretty abstract, and difficult for the other half to conceptualize I guess. I'd play it any time - and I think it's a great intro to area-control type games (which are still being introduced to my friends). I have two copies of this game, one with the board framed and on the way of my game room. Pieces of that game are posted in a shadowbox.

An incredible game.  I was too late on the scene to buy K&K at reasonable prices, so my perception of China is uncolored by the previous game.  This is, by far, my favorite area control game.  It plays incredibly quickly -- so much so that the end of the first deck typically catches us completely by surprise.
The only drawback of the game that I can see is that, although our small group loves it, the other people we've tried to introduce it to have hated it (and this is the first game that's happened with).  So, I don't know if it's the single scoring at the end or the double-area control (territories and diplomats), but it doesn't have as wide of an appeal as I expected.

It's always a good game to get out.  The rules are simple and it plays quickly, yet still has interesting decisions and a feel of direct competition vs your opponents.  I like how the cards generally allow a play and there are multiple paths to take.

It's not too deep and some like to wait and not be the first to open a province.

RATING: 7.5
Very strategic game, very balanced, easy and quick, but also very cold. Strategically you have to consider dozens of factors, but after all the game is not mind-stressing. Rules are very simple and you have many ways to get points: this leads to many calculations during the match that may slow down the pace. On the other side, having just 3 cards helps you to reduce the slow pace and make a quick choice when it's your turn. Cards help to vary the game but luck is almost no involved. Anyway, the game is really cold imho and there's absolutely no pathos. It's just an abstract game after all, but doesn't have the fascination of other abstract games, like, for example, the good old Samurai. If you want an abstract game to play with 3 or 4 players, this may be your game, but I personally prefer games that bring more fun and after all are not less strategic.

This is a fast, smooth, and think-y area control game. Each player plays according to the cards they have drawn into their hands. If someone can memorize their opponent's color one can be better at this game.
I can see there is multiple path to victory because I tied first on my first play with veterans of the game in there by losing first in the beginning and later had a 16 point jump in having the longest 8 connecting cities.

It's an interesting and somewhat fun game if you like abstracts. I tend to like other type of games better but as an abstract this has captured my attention and the Chinese theme helps quite a bit.

One trademark of German games are the unusual and novel scoring systems and here is one that doesn't work for me: a fully occupied region awards varying values according to majority presence-yes, I admire its novelty but it is the number crunching that I'm forced to consider (though I guess I could just place for a presence, so ease up on the left brain activity). More addition, in that a player with a majority presence in adjacent areas scores a varying value. Simple and clever, but what happened to fixed values for us non-accountants (sob). China then throws in multiplication (one difference from Web of Power) when you place a fotress. When player status is a maths exercise and the values are so opaque, there is no sense of race for me. Guess this isn't my cup of chai.

China gets 7, Web of Power gets a 6.5.  China cleans up a few (relatively minor) issues with the predecessor, and provides a better scoring system and a cleaner double-sided map. More importantly, China's 4 face-up cards vs. WoP's 2 reduce the luck of the draw to a negligible level. WoP is too  reliant on luck of the drawn cards. Both games have some screwage factor but not so much to detract from the game. Overall, this is a fun and tense game with excellent repayability value, although luck plays a prominent role. Surprising reward for so little time investment.

I think I like this game better than Web of Power. Scoring the areas only once adds more value to the emissaries and the fortification doubling makes their use very important and adds a new twist to the game, although the more I think about it the better it might be to just put down fortifications right away while they last.

Speaking of which, I got six in the game but the rules lists five. Anyone know which is right?

A game to which I can apply one of my highest accolades: Knizian. The house scoring system is inspired (leader gets points for total number of houses, 2nd place gets number of 1st place's houses, 3rd gets 2nd and so on) and I'm surprised it hasn't been pilfered for other games (or has it? let me know!). And then on top of that is another beautifully elegant mechanic: the emissaries, which are cleverly limited by the houses. The card selection gives just enough uncertainty to the play and overall the game feels like it packs a lot more into 30-40 minutes than it has any right to.

RATING: 7
Enjoyed playing Web of Power, and this remake certainly fits the bill. 
There are 3 levels of scoring going on. Area majority in a province where you want to have a lead, but not so much that you give the 2nd place player more. Alliances where you want to win and not compete where you stand little chance, building longer roads....
A lot going on for a simple game. 
Plays well with any of 3 to 5 players though with more players you pretty much have to take what the cards give you.

Pretty fun game, but it's easy to completely blow out new players which makes it tough to pull out among inexperienced gamers.  Hopefully if you play with a new player and they lose by 30 points they will say "aha, I see what I should have been doing, I'll try that next time" and not "graaaargh I'm going home... forever."

I need to play it more to get a better opinion. It seems on a 1st play to end a bit too quickly, and I'm not sure about the balance between the emisseries, the roads and the majority scoring along with the dependance on card colors to come up when you need them, but it offers a lot of gameplay in a economical set of actions and time. 
Want to play again.

RATING: 6
Gives a sense of a wrestling match with everyone in straitjackets.  It was interesting, and I'd play it again, but I greatly prefer games where your options are enormous and the best one is unclear.  In China, you hold three cards, and what you can do is solely determined by those cards, giving you about 5 to 10 choices each turn, usually only 1 to 3 that make any sense.  I also disliked the scoring method, which resulted in inequities in many cases. (One could argue that that's an essential part of the strategy, but I still disliked it.)

Slightly dumbed down version of K&K. Needs to get rid of the three face up draw cards and revert back to two, the fortress is a good idea that doesn't quite work and there's not enough links between regions. A great game system at heart, and I enjoyed myself, but inferior to the original. Probably easier to play and understand for newbies however.

I sometimes find area control frustrating especially when it is combined with majority control.  However, the many options in China mitigate my usual dislike of those mechanics.  It doesn't hurt that this game plays incredibly fast for an area control game.  The pieces are cute, but the theme is fairly pasted on.  The art work is good and pleasing.  It's a good filler or end of game night dessert.

Este fascinante jogo de dominaçao de territórios combina multiplas possibilidades táticas, regras simples de aprender e partidas leves e rápidas.
O objetivo deste jogo, ambientado na China antiga é dominar e influenciar regioes para se tornar o novo Imperador. Para isso, os jogadores devem construir casas e enviar emissários as cortes regionais, influenciando-as.
Este jogo é baseado no já famoso e conhecido Web of Power.
Interessante quando houver a necessidade de um jogo estratégico e rápido.

China é um jogo agradável, por ser rápido, elegante e ter mecânicas interessantes, quer pela originalidade, quer pela facilidade de se “entrar” nelas. O tabuleiro fica engraçado no final do jogo e apetece voltar a joga-lo de imediato. É um jogo no limite do familiar, que dá bem para gamers, pois as decisões nem sempre são imediatas. Recomendo.

In comparison, the main issue is that the purple region has no 'sister' province but it is no bigger than the other regions.  In WoP, the purple region is huge.

On the other hand, a draft board of 3 instead of 2 is good for the game.

--Nov2006-- A nice variation on Web of Power.  I own the original, and - despite the fun of the fortress pieces - will not be picking up China as well.  Now that's not to say it's not an excellent game: it is.  But it's not sufficiently compellingly different than Web of Power to mandate a purchase.  (What's more, I think I prefer three face-up cards to four.)

I've liked this game enough to shove it onto the table, but we might be coming to a close here. What got me initially was how interwoven the scoring was - the interdependency of houses and emissaries. The mechanic is polished and tight, but this game - like so many polished euros - ultimately fails for me. The mechanical polish hasn't left room for player interaction. Sure, initially I felt it was nifty to be stepping on each other's toes, but I prefer games where you more like punch in the face. The game's harmless, no-frills and no thrills.

One of those games that doesn't bother with its setting, and doesn't really need to. This is a terrific, subtle game. It has a great combination of board play and hand management. It never feels difficult to learn, but it does feel like it has a lot of depth for its ruleset.

A merciless game of area control, and one of my favourites. The scoring system is extremely difficult to teach to non-gamers, but the game is otherwise simple and well thought out. Can be too confrontational for some groups.

See my review for more info:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/66424

Has a little bit of a groupthink problem in that, if one player concentrates on a single scoring mode, the others must follow suit, reducing game variety. But still an excellent game, unchallenged in the niche of 45 minute area control.

Early review from first solo play: This is one of those games where the scoring is more complicated than the play mechanics, so you can play right off the bat but you'll be a pushover to an experienced player. There are a lot of agonizing decisions to make here, despite having only three cards to work with and two kinds of pieces to place. It definitely seems like you need to play tactically and constantly optimize. Investing in an undeveloped region is often less profitable than taking advantage of somone else's hard work. And besides, the cards often hinder your strategy anyway. It's a pretty fast, two-layer area-control game. Nicely done. Clean. Provisional rating of 7.5.

Simple area-majority but very quick and simple rules and plays quick.  Not too brain burny and a really really neat game which would also work as an into to heavier games but  is great in its own right.  This is THE area majority game of choice. Would suit any collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An area-majority game with quirks. Schacht has put in some kinks to make decisions less straightforward for each player. The person with the most houses in a region doesn't have much incentive to add on to it. The person with nothing in a region has a lot! The emissaries are also a knife-fight, with no lead safe unless you commit a lot, whereupon your other scoring options suffer.

This game sorely needs the player colors to be different from the region colors. Confusing for the newbie.

"Looser" and more forgiving than Web of Power due to 1 more face-up card (making it easier to form pairs), and less luck-dependent as a result. But I have no preference for either, since the increased luck dependence in Web of Power actually makes it more tense, and the WoP map has more character.

A bit leery that the game boils down to following some rules-of-thumb after a while.

China --

Like Web of Power, it's deep yet fast.  I find the limited choices elegant, and the gameplay itself quite fun.

The few changes to the rules (from Web of Power) could be incorporated into Web of Power, and China's double-sided board is nice, but not enough to justify purchasing China in addition to Web of Power.  HOWEVER, Tanga made me a deal I couldn't refuse, so now I have lots of ways to play!

newer, re-themed version of Kardinaal en Koning (Web of Power)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played twice with 4P and twice with 3P. In this stripped-down area majority game, players take turns playing cards from their hand to place pieces on a map. There are 3 different pieces which can be placed down (houses, emissaries and fortifications), and there are a few important limits to how those pieces are played, but otherwise that's the gist of the game.

The scoring system for houses is clever; players are encouraged to win majorities by slim margins to avoid benefiting the second majority owners. Another wrinkle is the placement of emissaries which is dependent on the house majority in that region. The emissaries are an area majority subgame, and are dangerous to ignore as they can contribute a significant sum at the game's end.

There are a couple of minor drawbacks to the game. It's firstly very abstract, but that is more of a criticism of area control games as a whole. Secondly, unlucky card draws can upset players. This is a little more serious, but a quick playing time of 45 minutes means I'm usually willing to overlook this. 

I'm impressed at how a variety of meaningful decisions are generated without resorting to superfluous mechanisms. This is one of the few area majority games I take a shine to, with the other being San Marco.

After three games, I'm still not sure how I feel about China. The scoring is really unusual, and I think the game might be better with 3-4 players, rather than 5.

I might have liked the game better if it were a little less abstract.

The rules are greatly cleaned up from Web of Power, so the game teaches and plays very smoothly.

While the theme isn't really there for me the game is still great.  It is fairly easy to pick up and the game length isn't too long.  It also has enough depth to keep me interested in the game, yet isn't too much for people who dislike heavy games.

This is both a challenging and fun game of control building. I like that it has different boards on either side for different numbers of players. I'm not familiar with 'Web of Power' this is supposed to be based on, but upon appearance this seems to be an improvement on that system.

Thurn & Taxis kínai köntösben. Persze azért vannak különbségek, de ugyanannyira gyors, pörgős játékról van szó, kicsit talán absztraktabb környezetbe ágyazva. Nem tudom megmagyarázni, de jobban bejön ez a játék, mint a T&T, plusz még öten is lehet vele játszani.

The design feels very clean and elegant, but I feel like I'm missing a fundamental interaction between cities and emissaries--I understand every piece of this game, but not how they all go in together.

Bought after playing Web of Power last month. I like a little more chaos and randomness in my games, but I really appreciate the simplicity in gameplay of WoP. EDIT: I like playing with 3 (maybe I'll go to 2 as per WoP), rather than 4, face up cards to add a little more luck into the game. I know this is probably heresy in some circles. With 4 face up cards I felt like, "why even bother with the cards?" EDIT: The pacing and length of this game are just right, coming in at around 30-45 minutes for a 3-player game. Also, 3 cards up is plenty.

Nice 3-4 player area majority game that offers tough decisions and moderate depth.  China is divided into several provinces of different colors.  Players hold a hand of 3 cards that contain the name and color of up to two provinces.  By playing cards, players place either houses or emissaries into regions.  Cards in hand are replenished either from the deck or from 4 face-up cards.  There are several ways to score points, and you can do well for yourself by coming in 2nd in a region.  Most of the scoring occurs at game end.  Play time is around 1h at all scales, because you only go through the deck twice.  No real negatives, but it's not quite an 8 for me (yet).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good area-control game.  It moves quickly, although with 5 it can get frustrating due to the chaos.  Despite its flaws, I prefer Web of Power more.

UPDATE: Got it back to the table and it's a decent area control game, but really, Web of Power seems to do a bit better than this one.

RATING: 8
A great little area majority game.  Very simple to learn - only 4 pages of very clear rules, including examples - but the range of options to score points gives it more depth than most games of this simplicity and length of play (short).  You can get points from a majority of houses in a region, majority of emissaries in two adjacent regions (called an 'alliance'), and 4 or more houses in sequence along a road.  Very well produced, with colourful (2-sided) map and pieces.  Excellent fun, requiring thinking without brain-burning, for three to five players (with a 2-player variant too, that is OK).  Highly recommended!

I can see why for some this is the area control game of choice. China embodies several appealing features of early euros: simple rules, deep interaction, and a short playtime. If anything, it's over too quickly. Partly due to the length, partly due to practical constraints on choices, it can feel a bit slight.

The scoring rules are the heart of China. The game is really about playing slightly more efficiently than everyone else each turn and setting yourself up for more points at the end. You might say that's true of many games, but China is more obvious about it. For that reason, it's a bit dry, but it's still enjoyable, redeemed by the longer term consequences of decisions so that there's some strategy amid the tactical gamesmanship. It's a low 7 or a high 6.

RATING: 7
Simple, fun game. I prefer it over Web of Power - I like having more cards face-up to choose from, which feels like you have a lot more control, and I don't really miss the interim scoring or the funky non-adjacent adjacencies of the original map.

--- Summary ---
The map shows several colored regions (2/color, except 1 larger region with its own color). The deck of cards matching the colors; 4 face up, and a face down draw deck. Players get 3 cards each. On their turn, may play into a single region by either playing matching color, or any pair of like-colored cards. Each such play allows placement of a house in designated locations, or (possibly) an adviser in the center of the region. The total number of advisers in a region may not exceed the number of houses in the region belonging to the color with the most houses. Max 2 plays into a region, but only 1 if you're placing the first house there. At the end of your hand, replenish up to 3 cards in hand, drawing any of the face up cards or the draw deck; do not replenish the face up cards only after you've refilled your hand. Play twice through the deck (equal number of turns, I think).

At the end of the game, players score VP for the number of houses: the player(s) with the most houses score as many points as the total number of houses. Each rank below scores as many VP as the number of houses in the next higher rank. Also, each chain of 4+ houses of a color scores 1VP/house in that chain. Finally, score the advisers: in adjacent regions, any color with the majority (or tied for majority) of advisers in both regions scores as many VP as there are advisers in both regions.

great area-influence game with tricky decisions, and painful moves to open a new area for expansion.

This keeps coming out--but only about once a year -- still we've gotten more than a decade of play out of it, so I bumped the score up a bit to an 8

RATING: 7
Simple and playable area control game. The board depicts nine different regions of ancient China and there are cards matching these regions. Each turn a player plays a card to either place a house or emissary in one of the regions, and a second matching card to place another house or emissary in the same region. Once all the house spaces in a region are filled, the region is scored with points awarded to players based on the majority and number of houses owned. At the end of the game the emissaries are scored based on having majorities in neighbouring regions, and there are also points for roads of four houses or longer. 'China' is a very simple game to play (it feels like a very streamlined version of the excellent 'El Grande') and there are definitely tactical options available to the player, such as when to attempt to gain a majority in a region, when to prevent your opponents from gaining majorities, and when to gain a presence in a region to ensure points. Overall though there is a slight sense of there being too much luck determined by the cards and players drawing two matching cards each turn are going to perform more powerful moves than those who don't. However, this gripe with the game is negated somewhat due to the relatively quick play time

Fun Factor : :star::star::star::star::halfstar: 

Fulfillment Factor : :star::star::star::star::nostar:

Online maps : 
North America - So far I have found this map extremely enjoyable.  It plays well with all player counts.

Scandinavia - Most like WoP in it's design but with some nice power connections that move in an easy circle around the map.  The territories that you commit advisors to get isolated from others so you cannot chain them together easily.

AD 850 - A very interesting map where larger territories are broken down into multiple sections across the map.  Chains can cross the sea making for very cool placement possibilities.  It took a few plays to realize the possibilities.  The map results in insanely huge amounts of points from advisors.

Greece - Aside from it's cluttered and ugly appearance it's a good map.  It actually achieves in it's promise of making chains and advisors equal.  Very cool.

Life on Mars - A tough map that reveals everyone's plans very easily.  About as stripped down as you can get for this game making it very abstract. 

Japan - So far this map is brutal but fun with 4 and 3.  There are, at least for me, many moments of hesitation in your thought process.  Sometimes the choice to retreat is better than moving forward in a territory.  The east/west paths across the maps lead to much forward planning if you are to get out alive to play the whole map.  Roads can bring a route to victory when making alliances fail.

Soviet Union -   It's gorgeous for sure.  The layout is similar to China but has a massive amount of road building possibilities.  Very good map that seems to work better with high player counts.

Venice - Beautiful map built small for 2 players!!  Two games in and I believe it works well.  There are more blind draws to get jokers but the tension and planning fees the same.  It's a very fast map.

Arktica - I don't get a lot of feeling from this one.

Starmania - Very interesting reworking of the system.  Worm holes are singular spots that get the same treatment as a route as a whole.  The 2 territories for double scoring of advisors is a tough one to work out.

RATING: 6
Not really sure if I like the idea of drawing cards to limit my choices of where to place guys. I would really like to see what would happen if we could just freely place the guys. Would the game break? If so then this seriously calls into question the cards, are they just there to limit you? and does it then dictate the winner?

Combining two systems, e.g. go and rummy can be like playing with fire but I guess it seems to work here. My guess is that with repeated play it will simply come down to who drew better cards, if equally matched players play. Still the tactical play is rather differnt; it fills a niche as a multi player, quasi abstract (cards do add randomness) and it doesnt overstay it's welcome, it's rles are clean. So its doing many basic things quite well: a well made game. Doesnt wow me though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Just my type of game - interesting premise, clever rules that create tough choices, attractive board and pieces, good player interaction.  Turned on to it after playing Web Of Power, but I think I like this better - it has a more organised approach to scoring.  What I love about this game is that it is so easy to learn and quick to play.  Not that I have anything against long games (Axis & Allies is in my top-10) but if you have limited time and/or inexperienced gamers this is the perfect game to pull off the shelf.

I far prefer the graphics in the original Web of Power version of this game, and also like the two scoring rounds in Web. However, the tweaked mechanic in China of having four cards on display and available to draft is huge improvement over Web. This drastically cuts down on the luck factor and creates a much more balanced and strategic game. After several tries, our group has pretty much decided to play without the optional fortification rules, which tend to reintroduce some of the luck that the four-card draft eliminated.

RATING: 7
It's all about expectations, right?  If you want an El Grande that plays inside an hour, China accomplishes that.  Yet the result feels streamlined to the point of being a simple abstract.  The game makes up for it with brightly shellacked bits and stands neatly on its own.

I completely disagree with the statement, it's a light game. Ok, so rules are short and few. But if you'd really want to play this in 45 minutes, you'd have to play it like "Ligretto - The boardgame". I felt rushed and I don't like that in games. On the other hand it's not a real bad game. As the "5" says: take it or leave it. I'll surely leave it for far better games out there.

China is outstanding for what it is: a quick-playing, easy-to-explain, light-hearted, yet strategy-filled Euro. I will keep it in my collection for-e-ver because it fits a niche like no other game I have. I absolutely love it.

RATING: 9
Two plays, easy nine.  Interactive, strategic, and takes five minutes to learn to rules.  Each game has had incredible "A HA" moments, as the game is obvious and subtle at the same time.  It feels like a knizia, as the rules are incredibly simple and the scoring dictates the gameplay and is a touch convoluted.  Our group seems to be undervaluing emissaries at the moment, but it'll be a blast finding the right balance. Wow, currently the time flies by with this title.  The need for an overall strategy and the limiting of the regions with the cards creates lightning fast play, which is always a double bonus.  Highly recommended.  I have never played Web of Power, so I can't make that default comparison in my comments.

I like the decisions this game I must make in this game.  I enjoy the values of scoring are mostly reliant on the other players moves(except for houses in a row) so you must mix it up with the other players and give them incentives to help you.  "Help me, help you ,help me" games are favorites of mine and this does it really well.

It is impossible to overvalue emissaries, but trying to achieve them and deny them to the player on your right.  The group really has to understand this for this game to shine.

RATING: 9
Outstanding area-control game where you try to have the majority number of houses in as many regions as possible.  I really like the added twists of scoring for emissaries, roads, and fortifications, as well as the double-sided board.  The game not only plays well, but is also visually appealing, with very nice components.  I struggled with whether to search for the original Web of Power edition, but eventually settled for the readily available China, and am very glad I did -- UPDATE: Lowered from a 9 to an 8 because I've found that the game doesn't play very well with 5 players.  I think it's probably a 9 rating with only 3 players, but a 6 rating with 5 players because it's just too chaotic with so many people since so much happens between your turns and it's impossible to plan ahead.

About [thing=18100][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=18100][/thing] is an area control and influence with a tad or route building. It has lean rules, being easy to play and teach, while, at the same time, providing players with a good set of options and decisions in each turn. It scales well from 3 to 5 players, with a two-sided board - one for 3-4 players, the other for 4-5.

[thing=18100][/thing] offers a fine amount of tatical choices and keeps itself with a quick pacing, due to the simplicity of the options given. Downtime is rather low, even with a lot to think about when making the moves.

The production value is good, with the cards being mostly ok, but the wooden bits are nice and the game is very pretty on the table. Replay value, due to the random nature of the draw deck and the plays made, is medium-high, not as much as in [thing=93][/thing], but still fine.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
On each turn the player can put houses or emissaries on the board. This is done by using cards - one if the color of the region is the same you are adding the piece, or two of the same color, that become a joker, to play a piece anywhere. When puting the first house in a region, the player can only put a single house - once "open", is possible to add up to two houses per turn in that region. Emissaries are limited by the number of houses in the region. After adding either houses or emissaries, the player draw back to three cards - drawing from the 4 open cards, or blind, from the draw deck.

Once the region is full, it scores. The person with the majority of houses gains points equal to the total number of houses in the region; second place gains points equal to the number of houses of the person that has the majority; third places gains points equal to the number of houses of second place; and so on.

The game ends when the draw deck runs out for the second time, or there isn't more places to add houses. In either case, plays proceeds until all player have had the same amount of turns. Final score happens:
- each region that wasn't score is now, by the same rules;
- routes of houses score: each route of 4 or more houses scores equal to the amount of houses in the route;
- emissaries scores if two adjacent regions have majority by the same player - the score is equal to the total number of emissaries in both regions.

In all cases, if there is tie for the most pieces, points are given equally.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- The main one: where to place houses and emissaries. This is important both for the tatical decisions os occupying a region (houses) and strategy for end game scoring (emissaries), with part of this on trying to make long routes of houses also for points at the end of the game. It is relevant to block others from doing long routes and has a lot of timming working on these choices. Finally, they also mix with the decision of which cards to take.
- The secondary: which cards to take - from the ones open or blindly, from the draw deck. 

There are basically these two decisions. While it may seems simplistic, [thing=18100][/thing] has a fine level of depth, when take into consideration the lasting effects of placement (everything stays until the end of the game, and can give many points to your adversaries) and the windows of opportunities and restrictions. It isn't truly hard to master, but sure has unsuspected depth.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Pretty to look at and has nice wooden bits;
- Easy to teach, with straightforward rules;
- Nice level of depth, due to the way the three scoring work, coming from the small set of rules;
- Highly interactive;
- Fast pacing and small downtime, with a whole play clocking under 1 hour.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- As is featured in many area control games: there is the possibility of kingmaking (but bashing is hard, as once on the board, the pieces can't be taken out or moved);
- Abstract - theme is just there, but do nothing.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In a much less meaner and brain-burning version of [thing=93][/thing]. It is much more relaxing not having your pieces being move around, taken out or being invaded by caballeros from the tower in the sea. Yet, [thing=18100][/thing] has plenty of the tension due to fight for positioning and majorities. There are less options in the turns, but downtime (and AP, for that matter) is much less an issue, with a more lively pacing and quicker resolution.

[thing=18100][/thing] has plenty going on for it, as mentioned already, and few knocks against it. [thing=18100][/thing] have the same situations many of the area majority have (high interaction, possibility of kingmaking), but the smaller frame of time demanded make more easy to overcame them. Still, for those that usually dislike the area control mechanic, [thing=18100][/thing] won't change much your mind: it isn't revolutionary nor greatly unique, but the three types of scoring, the choices presented and the short playing time put it ahead of most in quality. Recommended.

RATING: 6
Rather abstract game about making long routes and possessing area majorities. Kind of reminds me of Through the Desert, in feel.

The gameplay experience didn't quite work for me, though my reasons seem a little at odds with each other. I feel simultaneously that there isn't enough direction, and that the randomness of the card drafting may be controlling the game too much.

For example, I could start working on a route of contiguous houses (and where I do this may be either arbitrary or dictated by what cards I have), and you may quite abruptly stop me by dropping a house in my path. That's perhaps one of many things you could have done, and perhaps your being able to do it was dependent on the cards you had.

I guess I'd say moves feel initially rather arbitrary, but then increasingly tactical as the number of remaining options decreases.

Not a terrible game, but not exactly in love with it either. A simple area majority or control game, with the board being split into houses and emissaries. The interesting decision comes with whether to chose houses over emissaries If you do either one exclusively, it is probably not going to win you the game. Jack of trades is the route. Reminds me of El Grande, the poor man's version. Overall a decent game.

Rating this the same as Web of Power. Compare and contrast with Web of Power, the two games are quite similar with very small changes to the rules. Still a great elegant game packaged in a very short play time. Web of Power graphics looks muted but has a more sophisticated feel. The routes for alliances are also less obvious especially the sea routes in Web. Sometimes if you don't pay attention, you can miss these routes. China does not have that problem as all the states are landlocked. However, China components feels a little more on the cheap side. Overall, either design is good. Just go for one.

I finally played the new version, and while the map is laid out differently, it really didn't seem to effect play much.  I think the periodic scoring helps break up the game play a little, but the emissary scoring insures that the real will won't be known until the end.  I think I like the game a little better than when I first played Web of Power, but it didn't seem to grab anyone else.

Become the Emperor of China by exerting your influence on the provinces. Simple yet deep area control game that can be played relatively quickly. Control markers (pagodas to control provinces and roads, emissaries to control alliances) are placed trough intuitive card play. The 3 scoring methods (provinces, roads, alliances) are well balanced if using the optional fortification rule. This allows for different victory paths depending on how the board develops and cards held. I really like this. With Hansa and Coloretto, I think I'm a budding fan of Michael Schacht's designs.

The rules are really quite simple: on your turn you may only place 1 or 2 tokens onto the board (and there are only two types of tokens).

But first-time players may find it awkward because what you are allowed to place requires constant attention to the inventory of items already present.

No one can bulldoze his way to controlling an area.  It is all very oblique.

area majority + ticket to ride - use red card to house play in red region 
scoring houses when region is filled in
highest - sum all pieces, 2nd - pieces of highest, 3rd - 2nd highest etc
additional area where to put special pieces (alliances) which only score end of game.. those pieces only score if you have majority of special pieces in 2 adjacent regions
additional score roads - ie 4 houses in a row

Very chaotic game.  Hard to sustain long-term strategies.  Instead you are reduced to assessing the game on your turn.  In fact, it is much easier to play the game by ignoring the moves of your other players until it is your turn.  So much is dictacted by the cards you have, and the moves of the other players.  That being said, it actually is a pretty good game for filler considering it can have a fairly short playing time.

This is one of those short clever strategic games. Its advantage is an unusual system of scoring where while doing good to yourself you're doing good to others, too and the point is to get much more for yourself and far less for them. However abstract and a bit random it's a pure strategic battle for points. Reaaaaaaly like it :)

Yes, it has different rules than Web of Power, but it plays very similarly.  I think removing the mid-game scoring and adding an extra face up card remove some of the tensions that the original offers, but it feels almost identical to its pappy in gameplay.  I like that it has two boards, and an expansion board for replay value.

Had to settle for this when Web of Power was out of print. It's Ok, but I prefer the original.

Very good, with simple rules, fast gameplay, and yet a good feeling of establishing territorial control. I think Web of Power looks better, but this one's not hard on the eyes either.

it could be 8 but it is the same as Kardinal und Konig

[EDIT] who cares, it is a very good game, it deserves an 8

This game with its slim rules opens a broad variety of strategies and tactics. I continue to discover new facettes of strategy every play. The game has an extremely high replayability!

Very neat placement game where players compete to become the new Emperor of China.  Players must balance the struggle to get majorities in areas, connect lines of houses along roads, and position emissaries which only score at the end of the game.  A fast-playing, challenging game with lots of fun choices and tension.

Played only once. I have been a bit disappointed and found it less interesting than Web of Power. The fortifications are interesting additions, but the asymmetry between provinces has been lowered (compared to WoP), as well as the intermediate scoring, which I liked.
Still, it remains a good game and a decent alternative to WoP.

Short, clear rules.  Plays pretty quickly.  Interesting choices.  Reminds me of Yspahan, Puerto Rico or El Grande in that various scoring options must be balanced to get best results.

Played once. Just not a fan of pure abstracts. Oh, sorry... it's NOT an abstract? Yeah, riiiight.

As I found Hansa completely unintuitive as well, I'm wondering if it's just a Michael Schacht thing. I've not played Paris Paris yet... hmmm.

RATING: 8
Fast-paced, card-driven majority control game. Tense throughout with only minor analysis paralysis since the cards and single-region placement restriction limit your options. Three avenues of scoring make for interesting decisions (even if the emissary scoring feels a little disjointed from the houses)..

Feels similar to Ticket to Ride, despite the fact that it's a territory/majority game.  The game plays quickly and leaves you wishing you had just another turn or two.  Only one play, anxious to play again.

Claims to be one of the best area majority games around.  Haven't played too many area majority games but have been less than impressed by them ([GameID=18745], [GameID=36522], [GameID=29937], [GameID=15600]).  I was a little hesitant to try this one (had it once, traded it and acquired it again).  I would have to say of the majority games I have played, this one is the most impressive.  The rules are straight forward and it plays quickly.  My first play was with three and I have made [GameID=25532] in order to play with two.

My positive feelings toward this game may be boosted by the fact that I won by a large margin. :)

8 after 1 play

Rules make it look deceptively simple, though there are a few layers to understand. Game mechanic makes the game more tactical in nature. Since game time is short, the tactical nature feels ok. Attractive but simple game components. Player interaction is reasonably high with low downtime.

China is a pretty straight forward card driven majority game... but the several different majorities you can score in make it quite interesting. It is a bit harder to grok how all the scoring fits together for new players so its hard to get repeat plays but with an experienced group it can be a pretty cool, fast game.

I'll have to play this more, but a lot of the tension I get from playing Web of Power has been minimized.  Maybe it's because of the extra face up card, maybe it's because regions are scored immediately, I don't know.  Let me play China some more and I'll get back to you.

This successor to [thing=491]Web of Power[/thing] definitely reduces the congestion with "many" players, such that it's possible to have unused space on the board at game end.  Other than that, the changes can be taken in stride easily enough - with the exception of placing a fortress well/fortunately - if you already know Web of Power.

After 2+ Plays: One play w/ 5 and one w/ 3.  It is definitely better with 3 players, but I just can't get excited about this one.  I'm almost never in a situation where I can't play the pieces exactly where I want to, and to me this makes for a boring area control game.

Быстрая но сложная абстрактная европейка. Выставляем в свой ход, играя карты, домики и послов. Получаем большинство в областях в процессе игры, получаем за союзы в конце игры. Высокий уровень соревновательности, интересно играть, думать и выигрывать. Всего 30 минут и даже меньше при знакомстве всех с правилами. 

Минусы - немного надоедает, здесь нужно развивать центральную стратегию и следить за оппонентами. Иногда приходится делать "пакостные" невыгодные ходы, чтобы опустить лидера. Разумеется, это поднимает других соперников.

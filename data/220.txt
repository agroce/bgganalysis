120909 Nice tight auction game.  Another Knizia special where the choices aren't easy but nicely calibrated so they aren't too hard either.  A good filler game for sure!

High Society is a fun auction game with a twist.  The twist that the person with the lowest money can be manipulated and turned into a "king-making" tool, however.

Another excellent Knizia filler. The one with lowest cash at the end is eliminated, which changes the tension enough to bring this up from decent to great. More players is better... this should really only be played with four or five.

I didn't like it that much. Considering it's a Knizia that's surprising, as I usually like his games. I really prefer For Sale for the spot of a nice little filler, with an auction mechanism. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tremendous fun.  Sort of a heavier and more cut-throat cousin of For Sale, but unlike it's milder, sillier cousin, this one might turn up and bash you across the head if you don't play extremely cannily.  It can be edgy and tense, despite its speed of play.  And you can easily lose on a ite break or by having too little money at the end.  It's one of those really - it's as easy to throw it as it is to win it and you can end up making other's lives easy if your not careful.  I like it very much, but it's maybe not quite so much fun as For Sale, though it's certainly more brain-burning.

An okay game but it doesn’t really grab me, the push your luck auctions feels quite shallow and with four players you don't get many cards each before the game is over. The Knizia scoring mechanism is great though.

Surprisingly, my kids really like this game.  I thought they wouldn't care for it much.  They are even catching on to the strategy of the game - ie being careful not to over spend and be the one with the least money.

The cards are find and I was pleasantly surprised with the fortune cards.  They are very thick and nice to play.

Nice filler game.  I can see where this gets fun with more people (I played 3).  Catchy and quick.

I think it needs a house rule where you pull out one random red card, shuffle the rest into the deck, and then shuffle your single red card (sight unseen) into the bottom 1/3rd of the deck.  I played back-to-back games where the red cards were all at the top and it wasn't nearly as fun.

RATING: 7
A quick filler that is very intrigueing. Bid for items and to avoid negative items. Remember there's no change given. Also the player with least money looses automatically.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick easy to teach game that fills a slot for both beginner and veteran gamers. It's rule of the person with the least money being eliminated from scoring means that one can spend a lot of money but might take himself out of the game and because of that the tension of the game is high, especially when having to predict your opponents. Also, if so inclined, roleplaying pompous rich people can be a treat in itself.
Downside is sometimes the luck of the draw of the next object for auction can make or break some games. That being said, still a great game as a filler with strategy, quick, easy and fun and one I do not mind to play more than once in a night.

RATING: 10
Best filler ever, and a great intro for non-gamers. Plays in 20 minutes and shows people what they've been missing.

RATING: 5
An interesting auction game.  Players need to strike a careful balance between winning auctions (i.e., their winning bids) and saving money (since the player with the least amount of money at the end is fed to the crocodiles).  There is a small memory element in tracking other players' expenditures (though such memory is optional).

I'm not sure if I consider this a good point or a bad one, but the valuation of the cards was constantly changing.  Since a player's bids are primarily in relation to the player who has spent the most (has the least money remaining), the bids can go up as the game goes on, almost regardless of card value, as more information becomes available (i.e., a better measure of the highest "safe" spending total).

One thing I like is how the players' money is limited to the bills in hand.  If you use your small ones up front or for incremental winning bids, you lose options.

This one just didn't grab me.  I'm not a huge fan of auction games, but this one just seemed a bit too random for me.  There are some auction games that I've enjoyed and/or appreciated, but this one doesn't have a strong enough hook to lure me in and/or keep my attention.  If you *really* like auction games go ahead and give this a shot, but if not then it's not a must-play by any means.

1st play: Meh - Sorta interesting auction game, in similar style to no thanks or for sale, but not quite as good as those.  Some interesting decisions to be had, but I'm not sure it wins vs any of the other filler games out there.  Glad to have played it though.

Wild. I still haven't figured out a working strategy to consistently win this game ... is that even possible? A bidding game that forces you to maintain balance in order to win. Tough. Fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An auction game bursting with adequacity / adequatulence / adequatulism. It's not really what I'd call a card game, even though it's based on cards (you could theoretically design this game to be played without cards, i.e., by having bidding discs and drawing the VP cards as cubes/tiles from a bag). 

Not too shabby for a filler. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
My favourite auction game! I like the least money mechanic and the bluffing aspect. A bit more complex than For Sale, but more enjoyable as you have more money so don't get shut out of an auction just because of where you're sitting.

Demoed this with 3 players (2 plus a dummy, and the dummy won, go figure). Anyhow, we played the Uberplay version, which has attractive artwork. In the end though, I don't really care for the game - too chaotic yet restrictive as there is only one thing to bid on at a time. If I want a really quick, cute game, I would rather play For Sale, which has already proven itself as a parent-friendly game.

This is a fun game to play with a group of friends.  It definitely reminds me of Modern Art (e.g. bidding and short and simple gameplay), another Knizia game I enjoy.  I really like the automatic elimination of the player with the least money at the end of the game--that's a nice wrinkle that adds a layer of depth to an otherwise fairly straightforward and simple game.  It's not ALL about getting the most material possessions...

The game is light on meat, but it's got more meat than it seems.  It's not that great of a game in 3 players, but can get quite good with 5 players.  I would rate it higher, but I haven't played a lot of 5 player games yet.

Cons:

Another good Knizia auction game. The originality here is that:
- once some money cards are on the table, you can only add new money cards to up your ants until the good is sold
- the player with the least money at the end loses
- the betting system is a bit different for misfortune cards
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

this just seems like less of a game and more of an introduction to the auctioning mechanic.  the lowest man out wrinkle and special cards aren't enough to make it interesting to me.  maybe if everyone went into it with a gamey attitude, but then again it might be a memoryfest.

This is a simple bidding card game.  The player with the lowest amount of money is the loser - otherwise the best set at the end of the game is the winner.  There are 4 'bad' cards and 4 bonus cards.  The rest are straight points.  Players bid using identical hands for all players.  As a 3-player, it didn't seem to work well.  Might be better/best as a 4 or 5.  Cute, but nothing spectacular here.  

NOTE: Based on the German version "Einfach tierisch".

High Society is an "auction-filler", so it belongs to the same family of For Sale: they're clever fast games I suck at...
The two key elements are:
- the poorest player loses, that is an ingenious, very Knizian, rule
- the random order of the auctioned tiles, that sometimes can ruin the game, but it's necessary to mantain the tension and variety (and the games lasts 15 minutes, so who cares?
Great little game, way overpriced in its Gryphon Games edition...

A much richer filler game than for sale.  It is funny that one person I played with disliked the game and another really liked it.  The mechanics can be a bit harsh and may turn off some players at first.  I found the depth of strategy remarkable for such a quick..seemingly light game.  I've only played a couple times so far and could see myself pushing this up to a 8 even though I was brutalized in my first two plays.

I just haven't liked it.  I have found it boring each time we've played it.  Either it lasts too long for a light game or isn't long enough for a middle weight.  The decisions are tough enough and the "negative" tiles effects are too strong.

Has more theme than some Knizia games although is chaotic, quirky and "vulnerable" if you take it too seriously.

The interesting thing about High Society is how different the game plays every time, which is really refreshing.

The gameplay is remarkably simple, but the twist in the scoring just adds so much intrigue.  I love the "most corrupt player loses" mechanism in Cleopatra & the Society of Architects, so I really shouldn't have been surprised that the "poorest player loses" mechanism is a hit for me too.  It gives you so much to think about in every single auction and, unless you have a perfect memory, it always seems surprising when you see who spent the most or realize how much more you could have spent.

I've heard a number of people compare this game to For Sale because they are both quick auction games.  However I have a feeling that this one might be my preferance between the 2.  It seems to play even faster, which is a bonus because people will often ask to play again.  But what really makes High Society shine for me is the variable end game.  Since no one really knows when the game will end, every single auction is a challenge.  Just a classic game that I think everyone should try at least once.

I guess I'm not much of a filler person...this and For Sale leave me lukewarm. There is some neat stuff going on here, especially the bidding mechanism for the bad cards, and the winning conditions...but I still need more to keep me glued.

RATING: 9
My absolute favorite filler game. I marvel at the brilliant game design. So simple to learn and play, but full of agonizingly tense choices and decision making. I love auctions in general, and this adds superb wrinkles with the hand management of money cards, the bidding to avoid negative cards, and of course the fact that whoever spends the most money total automatically loses the game regardless of points. It's quick, but amazingly tense throughout the entirety of the 15 minutes play time. What more could I want? The sheer simplicity and elegance makes it great to draw in non-gamers as well. I love it!

RATING: 7.8
Such a simple game could be bland, but some of the mechanics really make it. For example, the fixed value cards in your hand mean you are sometimes left with very few bidding choices (what! you only have a $3M and a $25M, and the guy before you just bid $4M?). However, what takes this above and beyond your normal auction game is the rule that the person with the least money left automatically loses. This makes some of the bad cards actually quite attractive (OK, I lose 5 points but everybody else loses a load of cash). Got to be in my top 10 for fillers - very short, easy to teach and lots of fun.

RATING: 7
It is definately quick and tense.  I can see why this has a nice rep, but with me and the others I play with, this was compared to For Sale and this lost out.  I don't think this scales as well.  I played with four and it was all right, but I can see playing with three wouldn't be that good.  Five seems to be the best number for this one.  Perhaps more playings will move it up to a seven, or possibly down to a six.  

Update:  Played with three and it was much better than the last time I played. I think because the two I played with have played games similar to this and understood right away what they needed to do.  Moved up to a 7.

Too chaotic.  And as if there isn't enough natural chaos from the auctions, the 4th red card might show up early, causing the game to end early.  The person with the least money is the automatic loser (cannot win). ** Recently had a game of this that really dragged on... it was painful.

 If you like fast, well-designed bidding games, this is for you. Me, I'm ambivilent.

I've played this several times with a good group, but it doesn't really grab me. I don't have a rational reason for this. Sometimes I even win the game. I appreciate that it's quick, and I like the "least money left loses instantly"-Knizia scoring bit. But it's something of a one-trick pony, and I find it a little boring. I don't plan to buy it - a friend has it and often brings it as a quick filler.

RATING: 6
It's a cute little game, very much a filler. It's hard to have a strategy considering that the game length seems to have some variability to it (waiting for the four red cards to fall). I rate it as a six mostly because it seems more like a clever integration of two mechanics - press-your-luck and bidding - more than a game that feels like a complete experience to me. If you are trying to win, much of the brain space of the game is spent tracking the amount of cash in your opponents' hands, which isn't really my thing. I'm happy enough to play it but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Another simple, but engaging game.  Players have a hand of different valued bid cards and they are bidding for either positive or negative points.  Only winning bid cards are spent and at the end of the game, whoever has the least valuable remaining bid cards auto-loses.  Of the players remaining whoever has won the most valuable card total wins.  Variable endgame makes this even more tense.  Easy to teach and quick to play and compact.

You sometimes get the taste of Knizia in your mouth when you play some of his games. I don't say that it always taste foul but sometimes the taste is a tad too much. I don't know if it's too much mathematics that shines through or something else. My friends asked the first time we played this if it was a Knizia game, and he didn't know before that it was!!

This game which is an all-know-everything game where you know what all players have on their hand and what they have played (If you could bother to remember), is still a quite fun game. Even with the Knizia taste in the mouth after you played. It's one of those games that is in a way fun to play but leave not much to remember when you're finished.

He has done better games. The fun with this is to try and maximize the use of your cards as everyone has the same to start with.

One of Knizia's best short games. Can't think of another game that is so simple to teach and plays in 20 minutes that brings this much tough decision making and high anxiety. 

One of the best fillers out there, bar none. So good that it rises above being a filler.

The only concern is that in many games, there is kingmaking in the last auction or two. 

Update: playing with the variant that turns over your won tiles: this helps to minimize kingmaking.

Kicked up my rating quite a bit after a recent replay of the Uberplay version. Not sure if we weren't playing correctly the first time (many years ago now), or if I just didn't get it, but this does seem like quite nice filler. It's got two things - the "anti-bidding" to avoid bad cards and the "least cash at the end loses" that distance it from the fairly boring Raj; a strict mathematical approach won't work here, as it does in Raj. Very nice filler.

I hated this game initially. It felt wrong to me that the person who had spent the most money and was obviously not going to win because none of us would spend past them was still allowed to bid. Kingmaking!

But then I realized that the person who has spent the most still bids because they are trying to win.

What at first seemed to me a clever but fatally flawed rule, turns out to be the rule the entire game revolves around. 

Well played Knizia. Well played.

Quick little Knizia auction game. Somewhat reminiscent of For Sale (though really not as good). It has some interesting mechanics, but what really bothers me is that ends randomly and without warning. It's not so bad since it's a quick, light little affair, but it can be irritating. The he-with-the-least-money loses rule is interesting, but strangely it's not as tense as it sounds.

This game fills the same niche as For Sale, but I like this game a little less. I do think it’s “heavier”/mathy than For Sale as you need to think a little more, and I like the endgame twist which says that the one with the fewest money cannot win! This rule really adds a lot to the game when you are planning and bidding on the cards in the auctions. 

Also, the 4 special cards of which only 3 will come into play force you to take some interesting decisions. Still, I'm not really a big fan of light fillers and would rather play 1 big game than 2 plays of this one. And while High Society surely isn't a bad game,  I would almost always choose For Sale if I were to play a filler auction game.

This is what filler is all about, really -- you can explain the rules of this game to anyone in a few minutes, you can play in about 20, and everything including the scoring is just so simple. There's something of a luck element to the game -- sometimes the turn of the central card deck just screws you -- but overall this rewards strategy and is just a great little game in a great little package (I have the tuckbox version available from BGG -- totally worth it.)

I've played this with serious gamers and I've played this with casuals while pounding cocktails late at night; worked both ways.

Fun game that goes fast. Can create fun angst. I might have played this 100 times by now. I have yet to tire of playing High Society, which I can't always say about some games that I consider quite good.  Packs small.  The tiles are nice and thick. To me, this is a timeless classic. Morally, it should never be out of print.  Why not a 10? Because sometimes I don't feel like playing a game with the ubiquitous auction mechanic.  Experienced players can ratchet gameplay down to a push-your-luck decision of the game clock (fun & exciting).

This is game fills the niche that I would call perfect medium weight 15 minute auction game filler. High Society is a simple title to grasp at its basic level, but in a very short time frame it gives you auction intrigue, resource management, and calculated risk taking. The set denomination bidding is interesting, as is the 'poor man can't win' aspect which encourages some prudence in the auctions. I might add that the agonizing fun of the reverse auction is brilliant.

I find it interesting that this game is often compared to For Sale, and that people are convinced that it is a heavier or more skillful game because of the FS blind selling round. Though I will agree that the auction for HS is more skill-intensive (keep track of money, know when you can afford to take a negative card, know when you should take a negative card just because the cost will hurt the other players a lot, what currencies to bid with and how high) the variable game end actually keeps this dead-on with FS for me in terms of skill. Not knowing when the game is going to end, and having no way to control it means that you can only position yourself to win for a round or two. If the game ends when you want it to, fantastic, if not, there's not a lot you can do about it. I have no problem with this mechanic in a game this short and find the decisions here interesting enough to make up for it, but I do think people tend to underestimate how much of an effect this has on the winner when they try to compare this to FS. FWIW, I like this more.

Aside: much prefer the uberplay art to the newer Eagle stuff. The uberplay version is cartoony and purposefully makes fun of the conspicuous consumption theme on several of the cards...not to mention the box.

Very good filler. I like the variable game length and lowest cash loses rules. They make such a simple game more tense. Also the inability to make change is a thought provoking mechanic that can leave players a bit stuck if they bid unwisely.

RATING: 2
It is my firm opinion that Beestenveiling (High Society in English) can be employed to demonstrate the marriage of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle with game theory. In normal games, an action you take has a positive [u]or[/u] negative influence on your play, or on that of someone else. In High Society, an action you take can have [u]both[/u] a positive [u]as well as[/u] a negative influence on your play or on that of someone else, but you cannot know which until the game is over and done with and you are able to analyse the play pattern. Hell, let's go one step further and add retrocausality&mdash;events in the past caused by those in the future&mdash;into the mix. 

You cannot distantiate yourself from the rest and play your own game. You cannot play your own game because you cannot distantiate yourself from the rest. Far too often both options available to you, passing or upping the ante, are equally bad for your own position: upping the ante deteriorates your own financial position, passing means you don't get points at all, or get stuck with a bad card which will not improve your play. Trying to hinder another player is very costly, especially if other players don't cooperate (which is really in their best interest&mdash;sometimes). To add insult to injury, the lowest-remainder-automatically-loses rule means that sometimes, someone wins with a card which wasn't deemed dangerous enough to bid highly on. But it's no guarantee that a smaller card will secure the win: it depends on what is up for sale afterwards. Which you cannot know early in the beginning. Everything you can think of to help you or annoy another player with has been balanced by a far more important setback.

Quite frankly, I fail to spot its appeal. It's not that the auction mechanism is bad or that the material is bad: it's that there doesn't seem to be any point to it. The winner is the player who did not lose. I wonder how a player playing randomly does at this game. If he plays equally well, this game will be awarded with a 1 for 'broken game'.

RATING: 6
Knizia strikes again with yet another variation on an auction game.  In this case, players receive a finite set of money cards, and when you bid, you can't take back a card you bid previously - only add to it.  This creates agony as you try to save a good mix of high and low cards for future bidding.

The other twist is that the player that spends the most in the game automatically loses (similar to the crocodile rule in Cleopatra & the Society of Architects).

Light and breezy to play, but I found myself wanting to spend the time delving into Modern Art instead.

Great concept, and short enough that I don't mind the randomness too much, but I also feel like there's a little too much susceptibility to misbids by a single player throwing the game.

Components: Thick cardstock for the luxury goods, and nice sturdy cards for the bidding: the game looks and feels great.

Experience: I enjoy the uncertainty of when the game will end, as well as the punishment for the player with the least money, which is the twist that really keeps the bidding tense, and the winner in doubt.

I lost both games (v veterans Andy/Ian and fellow newbie Steven) by falling prey of overspending.

Next time I play I'll definitely memorise everyone's total spending and try to stay firmly in 2nd place at all times (only allowing myself to maybe drift in front during the first 3-4 auctions).

It's an interesting losing condition - giving it a different feel from most auction games, which only have an inability to purchase anything else as the worst penalty for overbidding.

I imagine with a different group, the game would play differently - another group might bid higher for everything, ending the game with under 10 units each whereas everyone bar me ended both games with over 20.

As in all auction games, it essentially comes down to a decision of how much each item is worth but the multipliers, thief, negative card and halfer makes calculating their relative value complex, despite the scoring being a simple number.

In each group (potentially, each game), I imagine the differing 'losing' values of money would give the items differing values - making the game partially about adaptability. 

The fixed values of cash make the bidding itself a more thoughtful process and encourage you to start at the value you think it's actually worth, solving the problem of 'slow, crawling' auctions that can arise in other games.

Excellent auction game from Reiner Knizia.  Players are bidding on luxuries, however each player has a fixed set of money cards to bid with, and there is no making change.  Bad cards see players bidding to avoid taking it.  The player with the lowest cash at the end of the game is excluded from winning.  Quick playing - high angst sort of game - amazing stuff.

Not a bad 10-15 minute filler, but there are others that I like better.   This one is a bidding game, where everyone starts with the same set of cards (something that has been done several other places, of course) but there is always a twist.  Fairy Bucks is a good alternative.  This game has massive swings of luck, since some cards double your score or halve it, and that can be huge to say the least.  There are also negative cards, which is the highlight of the game as far as I'm concerned.  Not bad, not great, but easy and painless enough to be fun.

High Society distills a long list of Knizia's best ideas into the most concentrated of packages. It's a masterpiece of "less is more." It:

* Plays in a short time with fast turns
* Is easy to learn, rewards strategic play, but allows for lucky wins
* Provides leaders with risk, and stragglers with hope, until the end
* Emphasizes player interaction with an auction and visible player positions
* Creates diverging valuation puzzles for each player that matter to everyone else
* Has an unpredictable ending to keep the final turns from going slack
* Adds bidding wrinkles to increase strategic interest and skip to directly to the pressure
* Uses a scoring twist and a measured amount of hidden information to create tactical tension and endgame drama
* Presses hard on the psychological buttons of loss aversion to engage players

I refer to High Society's example when I evaluate the effectiveness of all other games. My only complaint is that it doesn't support fewer than three or more than five players.

This is a bidding game unlike any other bidding game out there. At the end of the game, player who has the least amount of money automatically loses.

I love how you need to balance out the lower and higher denomination in your hand. If you're left with only bigger notes because you've used the smaller ones in your previous bid, you're stuck making higher bids as your starting bid. This in a way affect the tension of the bidding.

Bare-bones auction game that has some interesting decisions, but maybe too little chrome to make it exceptional. A good short game.  The mechanic of automatically losing if you have the least amount of money at the end makes the game  more interesting than it otherwise would be.  In most games (esp with 5 players), it seems like at least one player knows they cannot win several rounds before the end, but that isnt so bad since the games are very short.

High Society is an excellent game filler. I got For Sale after playing High Society which I heard was similiar.

I enjoy High Society quite a lot, though I wish I had more fillers in my collection to try something different to break the ice at the start of gameday while waiting for the rest of the players to arrive.

The 3 negetive cards in High Society can really change a game around in deciding who is left out and who wins at the end. You can't really know who wins the game until the last red card has been turned over to end the game. Anything is possible. The fact that the player with the less money is out of the running is a real killer even if you lead in points. In that case, having the most points means nothing if you run out of money.

I think I enjoy High Society a little bit more than For Sale.

I think there are better fillers out there than this. I like auction games just fine, but since you don't know which tiles will come out, you are merely guessing at which tiles to aggressively for and it ends up being more of a lottery than an auction. Clever for a few minutes but then the pretense of control wears off and you just hope to get a lucky tile draw.

I really enjoy this one. A game that every one can play. Reiner Knizia has made a simple idea into something very interesting by doing three twists: The player who has least money left loses, the different values on the cards, and the negative cards.

Nifty quick little filler (plays in about 15 min).  I especially like the twist where the player w/least money automatically loses.  It forces everyone to carefully consider their bids.

Played 10+ times. After enjoying some of Knizia's games recently, my opionion shot down again. This is what I loathe about Knizia's games: too dry and mathematical. With the plethora of auction games available, this one just isn't much fun for me. // The brevity of the game, and my realizing it is fairly-random filler has upped the rating of this one for me. Alvin Madden's art in the uberplay editions helps too! Very easy to teach. Up from 4. [uber/g]

As auction games go, this one as an interesting twist: the limited number of different currencies force players to choose wisely when to spend and how much.  Interesting anti-auction mechanism for the thief and penalty cards, the first one to bail out of the auction does not pay anything but ends up with the penalty.  The others who actually bid lose what they bid.  Very interesting.

[Auction, Filler] {5P:8, 4P:7} Knizia's gem of a filler. Plays quickly. Has surprising depth and excruciating decisions for its weight. Amazing how a simple game such as this can have such variable gameplay, a nice ending twist, and an uncertain game-ending mechanism. The uberPlay version is a bit overproduced, hurting the game's portability, but the tiles are superb. Only wish the cards were linen-finished instead of plastic-coated. Regardless, High Society is an excellent purchase for any gaming group. // Update: Burning out on HS a bit, but it remains a great filler (down to 7 from 9).

Now on ipad :) I LOVE bidding games like these! It plays out quick which is great because you'll want to go more than one round for sure.

Having to monitor how much you're spending (poorest person loses) and what denominations you have left, plus paying to *avoid* bad cards creates a few more layers that makes it much, much more interesting to me than For Sale.

In High Society players simply bid for valuable items, highest value at the end of the game wins. It is, however, not just yet another auction game because of the following features:

- There is no change. You can only bid with the notes you have ranging from 1 to 25 million.

- You don't know when the game will end, or which items will enter play up to that point.

- The player with the least money left at the end of the game loses no matter his score.

These rules create a very tense auction but also add a heavy dose of luck. It is also quite possible for players to be out of the running for all practical purposes by about midgame. Then again, the game is short enough that these detractors don't drag it down too much.

High Society is a highly enjoyable card game from Knizia. It's not unlike For Sale, using money cards to buy items. Of course, there are a number of significant differences, the key ones being that you cannot make change with the cards that you pay and the player with the least amount of money at the end loses automatically, regardless of the points they earned. This creates quite a bit of thinkyness and tension for a simple card game. And like For Sale, it never feels too lucky or random as there is a fair amount of control.  Scores can be disparate, however, and some times players must work together to keep certain multipliers away from other players.

A classic Knizia scoring mechanism turns what would be an average auction game into an interesting little filler.  Balancing between obtaining assests and holding on to enough cash to not be the ultimate loser offers enough tension to keep this one visiting the table.

UPDATE:  I have to lower my rating of High Society.  Although I enjoy the game when it makes it's way on to the table, it just hasn't done as much recently.  Also with the genre of auction games ever expanding, and fillers like For Sale and No Thanks, I find High Society is beginning to slip further down my to play list.

Outstanding! The player with the least amount of money when the game ends is out of the game. Even if you have the most Luxury Possesions you are still out of the game.

You always have to at least have more money than 1 other player in order to have a chance at victory.

Got a little jacked off that the new edition by Fred Games stuffed the game up by making the cards in such a manner as to make them visible from the sides - JACKASSES! Spent so looooong textering the sides of the cards to make them less visible, when someone mentioned in a thread on the Geek to just play them from the box! But the textering works well. I like this game. It has the usaual weird but interesting inverse of what you think a mechanic is gonna be Knizia. My eldest dosn't like it yet because she can't handle the way you run out of cards if u bid too much. It's not like Modern Art or For Sale. I still can't figure out a tactic especially as each game is so different. For such a quick filler it can be a bit of a brain burner.

Interesting auction game.  Slightly more complex than For Sale which can be good or bad.  Like the elimination aspect.

RATING: 6.5
The randomness of the end really can decide which strategy will emerge victorious.  A drawn out game benefits the spendthrifts, while the short game benefits the buy big, buy early types.  Also, as the game winds down, you seem to always have kingmaker situations.

For Sale might be cementing its place as the light auction filler for me.

This is a typically simple Knizia filler game. The twist here is that you must spend your money to get points, but the player with the least money at the end loses, regardless of point values. It's a very simple concept, and implemented in a more entertaining and complex manner in Cleopatra and the Society of Architects. However, this game is much more accessible and faster-playing. Even though it may not seem to have a ton of depth, it is far from solvable as the strategic equilibria really depend on the approaches of the other players. Unlike some auction games where valuation of each card is an important skill, the items up for bid here are never clear-cut as to what you should pay, except in relation to the players' relative scores, net worth, and end-game timer. Don't confuse this variety with infinite replayability or anything, but it is a game that you can come back to again and again, at least if you haven't played in a while.

[I've rated this using the BGG recomended ratings.] Really really easy to learn. Very very fast to play. Scales excellently. To me, it's like Ra stripped down to its barest essentials. In particular, (a) bids are made under the pressure of not knowing EXACTLY when the game will end while having an idea on how soon the game is LIKELY to end, and (b) there is a variability in the value of some cards to different players. However, the game does not and cannot have the depth of Ra, as one is only ever bidding on a single card whose value (even where it is variable) can generally be determined, rather than bidding on a collection of tiles that have postive and negative synergies.

I enjoyed this immensely based on my first play. A wonderful Knizia design offering both tantalizing and agonizing choices, in a unique auction mechanism.

Update (01/15/12): This is another Knizia design dealing with min/maxing during an auction. Bid too much, you lose; bid too little, you lose. Bid just right, and you may win. It's almost like Modern Art in that regard. Lately, I've become frustrated with such mental exercises, that I've avoiding these types of auction designs. Dropping from an '8' to a '7'.

すぐに終わるので、いわゆる競りゲームのじりじりと非常に疲れる感じはなく軽く遊べる。
一番浪費した人が負けになるというルールが肝で、競り落としたものがいくらになるというようなことはないので、相場が毎回変わる。つまり一番浪費している人に合わせて、金を使い二番目に浪費することを目標に入札していくということだ。
もし最初に素晴らしいカードが競りに出て、それを控えめに落札したとしても、その後他のプレイヤーが非常に倹約した場合に負けになってしまうというのは面白い。

This is a great filler game for medium sized groups.  I like that the value given to objects totally depends on the people you happen to be gaming with.  The rule about the player with the least amount of money losing automatically is what makes the game; without it, the affair would be severly lacking.  Sometimes the order in which auctions are drawn can make the experience a bit of a dampener (i.e. if only multipliers and penalty cards come up).  On the whole though, the game is very quick and fun.

Well, I'm a sucker for short auction fillers.  This one definitely had some Knizia flair.  I really enjoyed the variable ending and the somewhat straight forward scoring.

I'm not sure if it's actually better than "For Sale" though.  The theme of flipping houses is much easier to understand and For Sale is a much easier game to understand.

Still, I'll definitely grab High Society if it is ever available to me.

Irritatingly random end of the game is not the most serious problem here.
The biggest issue is that several players are put in lose-lose situation* even long before the game ends.

Neat idea, but - sadly - it does not work properly.  No control=bad game.

* you get a choice of spending almost all of your money (and lose because of having the least amount of it at the end) or not buying a card without which you have no chance of winnning...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It seems to me a little more meat to chew on here than For Sale even though I love Dorra and For Sale is a very nice fast fun filler, I think this is possibly the better game as you have the tough choice of buying more but not trying to spend more money.  Then there is the unknown time factor coupled with the ‘negative’ cards that you don't want to get stuck with so you might need money for them as well.  

Great filler

What makes this game interesting and different is that whoever has the least amount of gold at the end looses, no matter how many victory points that player has.

Unfortunately the ending condition's random occurance (when the 4th special tile comes out), and having no advanced information on what cards will come out in the next few turns means that while you can play strategically, if the wrong cards come out, and the game ends too soon or too late, then who wins comes down to luck.

My favorite auction game!  High society is a "deep filler" that is quick to play but provides opportunities for lots of tough decisions.  When playing with new players or other groups, it is always fascinating to see how the "market" (i.e., all the players) collaboratively figure out the valuation of the cards (especially nebulous ones like the 2x's, 1/2, and thief) without necessarily any discussion.  My favorite things about the game include:

1)  Simple to teach, difficult to play well.  The rules can be explained in about 3 minutes or so, and each game only lasts about 15-20 minutes, but it is hard to consistently do well even if you know the game well.  This is because of the next point...

2)  Balance between calculation and psychology to arrive at market value.  The game isn't random because there are some hard facts you can lean on.  For example, you know the total money supply (since everyone starts with the same amount of cash, you just multiply your starting amount by the number of players).  You also know how many hard luxury points are out there (cards with values 1-10, so 55), though all of them may not come out since the game end trigger depends on the card draw.  However, not everything can be perfectly valued - the 2x's, 1/2, and thief cards vary greatly based on what cards you have or think you can get.  People also may react differently to loss cards (-5, 1/2, thief) than the positive cards.  And valuation changes dynamically based on how close we are to game end, how much money has already been spent, and who has spent what.

3)  Innovative mechanics.  There are at least 4 interesting mechanics nicely folded together in this game:
A. Game theory optimization with constraints: While your objective is to get the most points, the more money you spend in order to accomplish that objective, the more likely you will be eliminated.  Everyone knows this, and so is trying to get others to spend more and push the constraints further out, but then will tiptoe the line as much as possible.
B. Bidding on negative value cards: Negative cards are bid in reverse - the first player to pass gets their bid money back, while all others pay into the pot.  This has the side effect of forcing those who do not have a lot of cash (or different denominations) into the tough choice of taking a bad card or parting with their money.  Valuation (i.e., deciding when to pass) for non-integer valued cards (1/2 and thief) are especially tricky.
C. Discrete blocks of value: You can't make change in this game, and so it really matters whether you spent 3 cards to bid $25M vs. 1 card.  Money is in discrete denominations , and so in late game, bids may make surprising jumps; hence, your starting bid or even the specific cards you bid require tactical forethought, and deeper planning and observation can help you exploit your opponent's disadvantages.
D. Non-deterministic end game trigger: The game ends immediately when the 4th red bordered card is flipped - hence, even though you do not know when the game ends (just like life), you know how far you are roughly along in the game based on how many red bordered cards you see.  The strategy shifts as the game progresses, with every card becoming more crucial as the game continues, and it is especially interesting in moments when the game last much longer (or shorter) than players  expected.

Because gameplay strategy and valuation is determined by the players, it makes this game highly replayable and routinely comes out on the table, albeit best not always with the same group so that a different mix of players can approach it fresh without preconceived notions of valuation and strategy.

It’s been years since I last played High Society and I have changed a lot in those years. To be perfectly honest I don’t remember much about the game. I remember I was worried it had too much uncontrollable luck, but I also remember it plays fast so I don’t mind much. 

The rules are pretty easy.

I bought the Einfach Tierisch! edition because it was dirt cheap from Adam Spielt [4.95 euro], and produced by Amigo, a company famous for it quality cardstock and compact, sturdy boxes.

RATING: 8
Players bid for tiles as they are revealed from a stack at the center of the table. Good tiles give you points (1-10) or "x2" multipliers. Bad tiles remove a point card that you've won, halve your points, or give you "-5". Bids for good tiles are standard, although your bid cards jump in value as they get higher and you cannot make change. Sometimes you are forced to up your bid more than you'd like because it's all you have left. For the bad cards, players bid to not take them. All bids are paid and the first player to pass takes it. The brilliant twist, though, is that the player with the least money left at the end automatically loses. The game plays quick, the decisions are interesting, and the mechanics inspire much taunting and goading. Everything you want in a simple, thinky filler.

Very good filler game. As is usual with a Knizia game there are some tough decisions, and there is a nice scoring twist (whoever has the least money can't win the game even if they have the highest score).
Update: This is somewhat group dependent, it fell completely flat with the second group I played with. I was concerned that the game wasn't that good after all, but having played again with the group I first played with, it is an excellent game. I suppose the difference between the groups is gamers vs non-gamers (good with gamers, not so good with non-gamers).

Interesting bidding game where having the most isn't always the best. Bidding too high early in the game might mean you are out of the game due to lack of money cards in hand. Or worse, not being able to stop from taking the bad bidding cards.

Can see yellow vs red of bidding cards on the stack.

RATING: 9
This is a great light auction game, which I much prefer over For Sale. It's a bit more complex than For Sale, but it makes for a much more enjoyable game as well.

In particular, I really like the balance between paying to own "good cards" versus paying to NOT own "bad cards". But the rule that really makes the game is how the person with the least amount of money left (despite what they've bought) automatically loses. This really forces you to think before you spend anything. The unpredictable end game also adds a flavor of luck into the game, so you have to make decisions based on imperfect information.

I haven't been a big fan of auction games, but this one's started to warm me up to them. Highly recommended.

I though it sounded like the coolest game ever when I heard about it (I'm a sucker for auction games with a twist).

I want to play it 3 or 4 times in a row with the same group to make a better judgement.

Together with For Sale one of the few highly esteemed filler card games here on the geek. I would go for either one as they both are good games and feel very similar. But given the choice I probably would give the nod to this one. The most interesting feature is that whoever owns the least money at game end, loses automatically. No matter, if he has the most victory points.

Another wonderfully clean and simple auction game from Doc K. The discreet bidding amounts makes for some intersting play. Do you make large bid increases early because you want to save your $1, $2, $3's? Or do you make large bid increases later because you've already spent the low cards and no longer have flexibility? The automatic loser rule for least remaining money is a real kick in the teeth and forces you to think hard about how much you'll bid at the end of the game. Great theme that kind of mirrors today's disposable society. I have a slight preference for Medici due to it's additional depth and multi-player interaction, and for For Sale for it's simplicity for new players. But this is right up there.

The more I play this, the more I appreciate the genius of the simple game design.  The rule about least money at game end really makes the game.  The conspicuous consuption theme is humorous and I like the predetermined currency cards.  The only downsides I can see are irregular card distributions (causing a premature end to the game) and A/P problems.  This should be a very quick game, but someone taking more than 10 seconds on their turn can make it drag, spoiling the fun of what should be a quick filler.

There are two notable elements in this short auction game: the chopping block mechanism that eliminates the highest spender, and the currency card mechanism that has you parting with bidding flexibility as well as magnitude. The element that is often quoted as a third, the reverse auctions, actually counts against the game if anything, as it hurts or helps players arbitrarily based on the seating order.

It seems you will often get endgame positions where you can easily flowchart who will win depending on who buys the current card assuming the game ends right after, and then the next card is turned up and you find out whether that happened or whether it's time for a new flowchart. That feels pretty random.

Great fun!  One of my favorite auction games (after Ra, Santiago, and Palazzo).  

Painful decisions about bidding and management of big risks.  

There is lots of randomness in when the game ends and when the bad cards come out, but them's the breaks; it must be treated as a light game.  

I have found this to be an auction game that can easily be introduced to non-gamers.  (So is 'Palazzo'.)

I have the 'Einfach Tierisch' version and I like its look.

Based on 3 plays.  The scoring mechanic, whereby the person with the least money is eliminated right away, is clever but ruins the game for me.

The result is a very unsatisfying finish.

Fast auction cardgame with very simple rules. Adding a unique flavor to this filler are the bidding to avoid misfortune cards and the need to avoid being the player with the least amount of money at the end of the game. Hand management is very important as all the players start with the same set of money cards. Although there is not much luck involved, the semi-random ending ensures some agonizing moments ...

Well. I find this similar to no thanks! The player who spends the most money is an automatic loser is a nice twist.
On the other hand this poses a problem. In a game with three players this means that the first player who spends 50 tokens is the loser. Because in a game with three players you don't want to loose.  I think this will scale much better with five players or even four. 
Thinking of maybe adding an extra stack of cards to play this with 6
I think that more players will mean that more risks will be taken
Played with four and five and I was right. Much better.

Only one play so far.  It's a pretty standard feeling light auction filler.  One issue is that with the tiles stacked up you can often see a reflection of red which tells you when the game will end.  It's hard not to notice even if you specifically try not too.

If it wasn't for the tension created by "whoever has the least money automatically loses" I would probably get rid of this in favor of other auction fillers such as For Sale, No Thanks, and recently Biblios.

This is a quick, fun game.  It can get rather intense, depending on how well you remember everyone's remaining money.  It gets nerve-wracking waiting for that fourth red-bordered card to end the game.  I think it works better with fewer players.  As long as players don't waffle too long, you can play this over and over again.

The game is more enjoyable among players who take it lightly and don't take too long to make their bids.  After all, you can always play another game.

This is a best "filler" that I own. My edition is Einfach Tierisch - which hasn't so good theme than the High Society has BUT the game itself is the same. Rules are very simple, but game has still unique taste: you want to have positive-number and multiplier cards BUT how much you are ready to pay for them? Because at the end of game, if you have least money, then you've lost and somebody else will win. Great bidding game which takes only 10 minutes.

I really enjoyed this quick bidding/resource managment game.  The "no change" and "least money loses" rules make for very interesting decisions about bidding strategies.  In my opinion, it is best played lightly (i.e. without specifically keeping a firm mental count of other people's finances but rather an estimation) as the end game becomes much more tense.  I haven't played it enough to say but I fear that amongst serious players it might degenerate into an excerise in card counting.

In general I'm not impressed with auction games because it takes quite a few plays to learn what things are worth. This game adds something new in that it seems to reward second place more than first. As such, I was driving up the bid and letting Drew take the prize when he had expended enough cards on it. Another interesting aspect was that the low dollar values are actually worth more than their printed price. The reason for this is that they are needed for raising the bid without over-extending yourself.

Despite these interesting things, the best part of the game was that it was over quickly. This is probably because the game focuses too much on the auction part and not on the reasons for why someone might actually want to bid on something. This game might be okay for a quick Knizia-auction fix, but you would have to really like auction games to get into this one.

RATING: 7
Even after 3 plays, this is still a very provisional rating.  This is a game that is very different from any other German game that I've played so far (despite the fact that it is a pure auction game), and so it is taking me a lot of time to get a firm grasp of what I think about it.  This rating could go either way, possibly dramatically either way, with more play.

UPDATE: confirming as a solid 8.  Before playing last time, I was very close to dropping it to a 7, but in this last session it began to truly click, although I still can't say that I fully understand it yet.  A wonderfully evil little game.  Have yet to play with 5, and it scales well between 3 and 4, but I strongly suspect that it is best with 4.  The balance between the need to grab points and the need to manage your money seems well balanced with 4, while the fight to avoid having the least money is too brutal with 3, and the chaos of the game's variable length would probably damage it on a regular basis when played with 5.

UPDATE: Dropped my rating a point.  The problem is that the core of the tension, the random endgame timing, also makes the game, at heart, a crapshoot.  You pick a game length that you want to play your strategy for, and if the game plays a different length, you're screwed (that's an oversimplification, but you get the idea).  I still like the game, but it's also kind of frustrating.  I'm not sure where this will go in the future. The fact that it's a filler keeps this from being the kiss of death, but I'm not sure where my opinion will go over time.

UPDATE: Back up to 8 after another set of plays.  My rating really keeps yo-yoing for HS, probably because when it's on it's extremely good, but the occasional dud leaves a bad taste behind. Nevertheless, the description of an 8 rating seems to fit best right now.

As a filler, not quite as good as Liar's Dice or Diamant, largely due to the inconsistency, but the gap isn't a full point's (or even half point's) worth.

A game that I got in a trade years ago and lay fallow in my collection. What a shame. It is a terrific auction filler, tough and agonizing decisions over your bids, with money so tight and restricted. It is now a regular request at my house. The combination of "must add to your bid with available cards" and "least money at the end loses" makes it so tense. I have a feeling the x2 cards might be over strong, but then they go for a lot of money - self-balancing? Excellent game and I upped my rating after getting it back to the table again.

You're pretty limited in your funds for auctions and you really need a clear understanding of what you're bidding on before you start playing. I should probably try it again before being this harsh with it but if I can't bring myself to consider giving it another try maybe it deserves it.

A small auction card game. I enjoy it, but I have to admit it is not as good as Cat in the Sack, or several other small auction card games.

This is exactly the same game as "High Society", except for the theme. I personally think the theme of "High Society" is very bland, especially when compared with this one: mice bidding cheese money on a "Paper Tiger", an "Autoroute Snake", a "Dalai Llama" or a "Tax Collector Shark".

Tricky bidding game with a typical Kniza-twist to the scoring. Good mechanisms for replayability with different special cards that trigger game end. 
For me this is an optimal filler with it semi-chaotic game play and flow. It is always about impossible pic the winner in advance as well as the loosers. Bit of strategy and lots of tactics in a game that usually ends within 20-30 min. Best with 4 or 5 but playable with 3 as weill

Enjoy this more than For Sale.  It offers a little more to analyse, as you have to balance the money in your hand and your score against the current scores of the other players.  You want to have the highest score in the end, but you cannot have the least amount of money or you cannot win no matter how high your score is.  It helps limit some of the crazy bidding we see in other games since it easy for a player to see it will take them out of the game.  In other games, it is not so obvious, so I think it helps teach players to bid responsibly.  Good intro auction game.

Played for first time, and I immediately demanded another game.  Very fun auction game with a few simple elements that REALLY make the game, including: no making change when making or increasing your bid, the bidding system on negative cards, the game ends when 4th red-framed card is drawn (may be much sooner than you think), and finally the one with the least money is kicked out right before you tally up points - quite funny.

RATING: 3
Being a big fan of auction games, I initially loved this game.  The simplicity; 15 cards and a bunch of money, and the usual Knizia twists - person with least money is out; must bid on disadvantage cards etc made for a very entertaining game.  And then things got serious... only way to play is to be able to count cards and keep track of all players - if one person is better able to do this they have a huge advantage.  Alternatively you can show all cards face up but then we found that once somebody was going to lose because of lowest cash they simply played Kingmaker by bidding on all cards that could affect game outcome.  Not good.   So I no longer want to play this game.  (Note: this was all three player games)

I completely misunderstood a rule and basically 'broke' the game early for myself and the other 2 players. Regardless I came only $1 million bucks from victory (?I forget how many pts in luxury he had?)  because I so damaged one of the others (I lost by $1 Million by being the biggest spender)...

RATING: 10
(Einfach tierisch.) A fast, nonlinear little auction game with excruciating decisions. Delicious. Absolutely brilliant.

There are at least two brilliant ideas here: the cards you spend never come back, so you lose flexibility as well as raw purchasing power; and the player with the least money left at the end of the game can't win.

Update: Back to 6. It works if played reasonably fast, but the mechanisms are no favourites of mine. Will play now and then as a filler since my buddies like it.

Played 10-15 times. It is fun, tense and short, but it is lacking something. It might be that it is a pure auction game. After nine games I raise it from a 6 to a 7, but I doubt it will go higher than that.

This is a fun, fast, yet angst ridden game. The thing I like most about this game is the subtle aspect of hand management. Because you can't make change for your bids it's important to consider how many cards you are spending as well as the value of the cards. Spending too many cards early will cost you flexibility in the crucial late game auctions. If there's any complaint it's that the ending is too random (sometimes coming early and ruining all of that careful hand management) yet the game is so short that you can just shrug it off and happily play again.

All sequential bidding, but the stuff you're bidding for (or against) really changes in value a lot depending on your current predicament. The hook is that you have a lot of different denominations of bills and you can never make change, but you can't spend all your money, but you need to spend money to keep bad things from happening. Try to win while also trying not to lose.

What a weird little game -- probably the worst adult Knizia game I have played thus far.  Why most of BGG considers it best with 4/5 players is beyond me.  With 5 players it is a complete crap shoot.  With 3 players you have a bit more control and the random endgame doesn't impact the outcome as much.

Keeping track of money spent by each player is of some use, especially in a game with fewer players.

RATING: 8
This game is right up my alley.  I love auction games and this one has a few sinister twists.  There are three misfortune cards that are "reverse-auctioned".  Players bid on these items until the first player passes.  The player who passed is stuck with a very crappy card whilst everyone else loses the cash they were bidding with; basically they were bidding *not* to get the card.  I think one of the keys to the game is figuring out how to play these auctions.  The other twist, which I love, is that the person with the least amount of money at the end of the game automatically loses ... a fantastic balancing mechanism.  I would have rated this higher but the game is almost too tight seeming quite clinical at times.  (Did rate it higher, it's more fun when you don't play with mathies).

Probably introduced this game as a gateway game to over 25 people and not one hasn't liked it.  If you explain it well they'll get it.  First game though it's just a learning to get an idea of what value of the cards should be.  The values are different in a 3, 4, and 5 player game.  Obviously 5 player games you see 40 and 50 million bids since it'll be lower scoring and more competition.

Pros: It's a simple,fast playing auction game which takes only a few minutes to play right out of the box. 

Cons: It's a simple,fast playing auction game that can be over in minutes.

What I mean by this is it's almost too simple and quick playing. And yes I know there are deeper and longer auction games out there. This game is very much an introductory filler auction game that eases people into the genre but I can't help but feeling a little empty after a game of this.So do those I game with... sort of an unspoken... "ok... that's it?... what else can we play"

High Society is a fun filler/party game that you can bring to the table whenever you have some time available. There are several interesting "inconsistencies" that contribute to make the bidding agonizing: you need to bid high to win but not too high and end up with the least money, you receive no change so you need to think carefully which denominations to bid now and which to save later, you need to choose between bidding to get positive cards and bidding to avoid negative cards and so on. Ra remains a deeper game but few games have a better depth/time ratio than High Society.

A pure bidding game. Unlike most other auction games, the value of cads currently up for bids have an almost constant value to all players, lessen tensions among players. Because the player possessing the least money lose the game, you have to actually memorize how much people have all the time to prevent yourself from getting into such situation, and that basically water down the games into simple money-to-victory points maths, memory, and a bit of bluffing. Not that it is unfun because of the auction nature, but there is not much to explore, nor do I enjoy the thought process involved.

There are some interesting ideas here, especially the "thrown to the crocodiles" punishment for the player with the least amount of money, but the shuffle of the deck can really affect your chance of winning.  Too many things that are out of your control determine the outcome.

(I own a Uberplay's High Society edition)
Quickplaying auction game and fun to play. I think this is the best light auction game I've played. Games varies a bit in length but are never long. For such a short game this is quite meaty game although there is a lot of luck involved. Knizia's best filler and works well with 3-5 players.

High Society is a bit overproduced but thematically better. Einfach Tierisch on the other hand is (even more) portable.

Received in a math trade (11/10/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I played once with my family and we all would rather play For Sale so I ended up trading this one away. Personally I enjoyed the added mechanic of having to manage your money (if you spend the most, you can't win), but when playing with family it just makes the game a bit more convoluted. I would play it again, but definitely not something I'd seek out to play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Quick play time, great filler.
- Limited amount of money of specific values, which can cause you to overpay for a specific tile.
- Tension because of the end game condition: the person with the least amount of money is eliminated from the game before scoring your tiles.[/i]

another auction game that i enjoyed a lot. it is kinda old and doesn't look very atractive in terms of components and the theme doesn't really excite anyone. but it has some very unique ways of handling money and auctions. definatly try this one out with an open mind if you enjoy auction games. it is also very cheap to get.

playing time is pretty short and you can easily play 3 or more games of this in one go without feeling mentally exhausted.

Very quick auction filler with some teeth.  No, make that fangs.  No, it is not as good as Knizia's "larger" auction games, but for a filler, this game does an auction extremely well.  The destructive items in which the first player to pass must take it and the fact the player with least remaining money at game's end is eliminated regardless of his score add some nasty brinksmanship to the game.  The only downside is that sometimes a player, especially at the 3 player count,can be forced into a kingmaker role.  Neither passing nor raising the bid helps his situation, but each decision hands one of the other players the win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Basically, players are bidding for cards worth different amounts of victory points.  There are a few negative cards mixed in with the positive cards, and the players bid NOT to win those.  Everyone has a set of money cards to bid with and there are restrictions on how you can play those cards.  Otherwise the only other wrinkle is that you can't win unless you have money left at the end.

Ingenious game, can't understand why it isn't rated higher. I just got this game, and I've been missing out. The game always has an exciting finish, no two games are the same. I love the heart-pounding reveal of who has the least money, love the anti-bidding on bad cards, love the uncertainty of when the game will end, love the careful planning required because each money card is a different value. So great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Now this game can get a little tense as not only would you want to balance having enough points, you would not want to be the person with the least amount of money at the end of the game as that person loses immediately regardless of points. Takes about 30-45 mins to play. A good game in itself. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This pure auction game has one feature that I don't enjoy--a single player is eliminated from contention at the end of the game, regardless of how well they did.  The all-or-nothing nature of this makes it not very appealing to me.  Additionally, you can gain a very large advantage in the game if you have an exceptional memory and can remember what other people have already used.

Decent auction game and I really liked the reverse auction to avoid the penalty cards.  It was interesting how the rules about the biggest spender is eliminated and the game ending after four special cards are reached, which seems to solve the big spender domination and the sandbagger issues in auction games.

The game end trigger can randomly appear quickly and can lead to some lesser games.  Additionally, the game I played was decided on one auction.  I'd like more auctions to affect the game.

RATING: 6
A fast and simple auction game.  Each player has the same amount of money with which to buy victory point tiles.  There are several tight constraints: you can't make change from your bid to up your bid by less than the value of an unbid card; you need to have money left over at the end of the game; and in some auctions you pay to avoid negative consequences.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very slick game.  Doesn't take too long, and the "lowest money = loser" is a nice touch.  There is a lot of balance here, but beware lest you raise the bid too high on a penalty card!  Someone might take it before everyone gets a chance to pay not to have it.  This game gets more interesting with every play.  Different game every time, something I did not expect.

I love this game, but it didn't quite hit the mark with others in our gaming group.  The first turn off was the random end game timing.  We reduced that by always placing one of the red border cards in a random last 5 slot, but for some reason the group still aren't won over by it.

Tough decisions, but easy to learn, quick, and just a lot of fun. A filler with auctions, hand/money management, and plenty to think about.

Note: although the game is simple, my non-gamer family can't wrap their heads around it. They don't know what they're doing and have to be reminded not to bid all their money, &c. It's a light game, but for gamers.

RATING: 6
I can only feel the competitive tension if I do the maths, which because of the various probable outcomes, becomes too much calculating and really not worth it because of the uncertainty of the red cards. Then there is the memorising of previous bids made, so really hard work. Pity, as the game play is short and fits theme well plus the bidding is agonizing at times. Alhambra the card game with an easier and fairer means of card play may feel similar albeit longer.

Why is it so good? You have no idea when the game ends so you want to get your points early or you may end up getting no points at all. But, in order to get your points early, you have to spend lots of money and the player with the least money loses no matter how many points they have. 

That's it and it's quite a conundrum!

RATING: 7
Like many of Knizia's fillers, it has one clever idea that drives the game - in this one, it's that the player who spends most money is ineligible to win. It's a decent trick, but there are several short auction games I'd play before this one.

RATING: 7
In High Society, players are wealthy aristocrats vying to gain the most recognition by bidding for various prestigious items (paintings, mansions, sculptures etc.). However, there are special cards as well that can either be beneficial (doubling prestige points) or harmful (halving prestige points, deducting 5 from your score etc.)

While everyone starts with the same amount of money, it is important to bid judiciously because the player with the least amount of money isn't eligible to win - no matter how many prestige points s/he has. 

This game is meatier than For Sale. Though both have bidding as the core game mechanic, High Society presents more interesting decision points.

A B-level auction filler. If you game often enough to make those worth owning or lobbying for, then go for it. The "player with the least amount of money automatically loses" rule is worth a few laughs, but overall this one isn't that great.

I think my low rating of High Society has a lot to do with misplaying the game on the first and only time I've played this game.  The person teaching the game didn't remember that the first person to run out of money automatically loses until the end of the game.  Rather than playing again to get the game right, we opted to play Cuba instead.  

I need to play High Society again some day, but there are a lot of auction games that I find more appealing, so it will probably be a while before High Society finds its way into my plays again.

RATING: 7
(Einfach Tierisch) When this game was explained to me as 'bidding for animal-hybrids & paying with mice' ... my mind went blank! 
However, regardless of the 'strange' theme, this is a great filler card game. 
It's simple, yet presents some tough decisions: spending your 'mice' to get the high value cards which will improve your chance to win the game, whilst not spending too much as the person with the least money/'mice' left at game end automatically loses!

I love the tension added by the rule that the player with the least money automatically loses -- adds another layer to the bidding.

The biggest drawback is that you can lose because two other players both way overbid on big items.  If only one makes the mistake, they lose.  If two do, one loses biggest and one wins.  However, the game is still a lot of fun.

very interesting auction game. The fact that you don't know exactly when the game will be finished and the player with the least money is eliminated makes the game very unpredictable. A lot better than For Sale.

In the Gryphon edition the quality of components is good, but I don't like the artwork and the images displayed on the auction tiles (very uninspired in my opinion) and I also preferred that the auction tiles would have been cards instead of cardboard tiles because cards shuffles better than those tiles.

How much is the 1/2x worth?  It changes every game, because you never know when the game will end.

RATING: 8.5
Very nice bidding game for 3-5 players from Knizia. I'm not a big fan of bidding games in general, but this simple and very fast game is definitely cool. What distinguishes High Society from other bidding games?

NO CHANGE. You have exactly 11 money cards of different denominations. You cannot take back cards when you increase your bid. This has some fantastic consequences for the game. It also eliminates the annoyance of incremental bidders by punishing underbidding.

NO SELLING. Each item you purchase has its own intrinsic worth in "high society status points." Your goal is to maximize these points. However, you cannot win if you are the poorest player in the game. So while you need to spend money to buy status points, if you spend more than anyone else your status points are worthless -- you lose. A sweet little tug of war between your status and your money gives you very cool choices. Some items you purchase are modifiers, which can double or halve your status point total. Yet another good mechanic that leads to different strategies.

ANTI-BIDS. There are two cards in the deck that you want to avoid, and when these cards are out you have to pay money NOT to get the card. The first person to pass gets his bid money back and takes the card. The other players lose their bid money. Takes a little while to get used to, but it's a neat switch.

UNCERTAIN ENDING. The game ends when the fourth red-bordered modifier card comes out. This can happen somewhat early, or it can be at the end of the deck. The uncertainty leads to some delicious choices, two red-bordered cards have been played, perhaps I should get moving on my plan to buy only after letting everyone else overspend first?

EXERCISES MEMORY. I don't care much for games that have face down or hidden information that you could track if you used a piece of paper, but in this case it adds a nice dimension. Spent money is placed face down in a pile. If you have success in remembering or guessing what denominations your opponents are still holding, this gives you an edge. What often happens is you lose track of the cards and there's nice tension when you take a guess. 

LOGIC. There's a logic to the game. At various points you can reason out what you need to do based on the fact that one player has to be the poorest and one player has to have the highest status. Knowing what cards are left (which you can suss out), leads you into situations where you reason out your own demise or prevent it. 

WHAT I DON'T LIKE. You have to be careful which players are at the table when you whip this game out. Players who do not play self-interestedly will kill the game, as they can wind up inadvertantly king-making by their lack of effort. Also, players who deduce that they can't win may turn into kingmakers if they decide 2nd place or last makes no difference. So it depends on the group. I was surprised to enjoy this game so much. There's a nice bit of a bluffing aspect when you shill up the price, or surprise a shill with a pass. I have the Uberplay edition, which has excellent production values, but I think I would have preferred they cheaped out the auction items on regular card stock to make the game a smidge more portable.

I really look forward to playing this one again.

High Society -- Played four-player.  High Society and For Sale both take novel (and different) approaches to the Raj bidding mechanic.  I favor For Sale for its elegance, but High Society's stipulation that the poorest player cannot win (regardless of score) makes this game noteworthy.  The game-end triggering conditions can be frustrating, but it's a fun filler.  The artwork and component quality are top-notch.

A brisk elegant game with tons of player interaction.  I love many of the mechanics (e.g., the &quot;you can&#039;t win if you have the least money&quot; rule).  However, although I usually like a &quot;press your luck&quot; mechanic (I love it in Ra), it seems to overpower High Society, making it more of a gambling game than an auction game.  Still, I like gambling and I&#039;ve had a lot of fun playing this one.

A well-produced Knizia auction game. Does this one distinguish itself from the other well-regarded Knizia auction masterpieces such as 'Modern Art' or 'Traumfabrik'? There is 'Medici' and 'Ra'.

A For Sale után kezdtem nézegetni a Gryphon Games játékait, mert fantasztikus minőségű a bookshelf sorozatuk. A High Society-ben mindenki fix 106 millióról indul, amiért 1-10 értékű dolgokat lehet megszerezni, emellett van 3 kétszerező, egy felező, egy -5 értékű lap és egy olyan, ami megszerzésekor egy pozitív értékű lapunkat el kell dobnunk. A megszerzendő lapok véletlenszerű sorrendben jönnek fel, ezekre licitálunk. A játék vége feltétel is szerencsealapú, ezért nekem mindenképp gyengébb, mint a For Sale. Talán megérdemelné a 7 pontot is, de majd meglátjuk mennyire lesz kedvenc a társaságunkban. Az első partik nagyon bejöttek és volt, aki jobbnak érezte a For Sale-nél. Szóval még bármi elképzelhető pontilag.

Brilliant in its simplicity, Reiner created another stripped down auction beauty.   But, one of my favorite elements to Knizia's designs, when they come together for me, is their level of fluidity and versatility, but I feel that High Society falls short of the mark on this.  The game is near unbearably tight, and completely unforgiving.  There really is no room for error.  The last few rounds can be frustrating in that you know that there is no way for some players to win, yet they still must participate potentially creating a Kingmaker situation. While I think that this is a great game and one that I will play if ever asked, it may remain too cold, calculating and constrained for my tastes. 

UPDATE: The more I play this game more I want to appreciate it's genius, but I've just seen some totally random games depending on the tile draw.  The crux of the game is guessing when the end of the game will come, perhaps more than clever play.  Still, when it works, it works well.

A simple auction game with three Knizian twists: you get negative cards by being the first to pass when bidding (and everyone else loses what they have bid); you can bid only with denominations left in your hand (no making change); and the player with the least money at the end cannot win. A fun filler, no more than that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can get a bit cocky with this one and blow it by spending too much money. Another Knizia "balancing" game. Should it be played Coloretto style with one red card randomly shuffled into the bottom 5 cards? EDIT: After more playings I think that maybe my idea would make for a slightly better game. It is a quick game (or at least it should be), but it's kind of disconcertingly fast when the last red card comes out within the first eight. I'm still not a good money manager in this game.

High Society is a good auction game. I like how the player who spends the most money loses. The trouble is, the game falls into the same niche as For Sale, and For Sale does what High Society does, but better. Still, I like it; it's just that I can't imagine choosing it over For Sale.

RATING: 7
[Uberplay 'High Society' 03 edition] {Filler; auction; optimal 3-4p} HS is a challenging auction card game but the theme of HS is quite thin. It is more fun, exciting and aggressive with more players.  It is unique with 3 nice mechanics - reverse bidding of "bad" cards, least money losing and sudden death. Due to the sudden death, players cannot wait too long to bid for cards (in order to get something cheap); therefore, bidding is more aggressive at late game.

I found that all kinds of auction games have the same problem - if one player doesn't know how to play well and spends all his checks too fast, he will greatly disrupt the game flow. Thus, it's better to find a suitable game group to play this game. And, don't play HS with players that are weak in controlling money. They usually have the least money each game and will find HS frustrating.

It's difficult to calculate the optimal value of the cards. The value of cards varies according to the mindset of players, the atmosphere and the purchased cards at that time. Therefore, HS has very good replayability.

I avoid buying more than 4 cards and usually won't spend more than 2 checks for a card. Spending too many checks per turn will reduce tactical options in future auctions. I don't think 2x cards are musts. The winner has no 2x cards in many games.

tl;dr: yet another Reiner auction game

I had played this once before, but I didn't remember anything about it. This is a pretty basic auction game. A card comes out and people bid on it in a regular auction. There are a few special cards that double or halve your points. That makes the game a bit more interesting. The game ends when the 4th red card comes out. In our first card this happened after 1 regular card had come out. The result was that the scores where 0.5, 0, 0 and 0. I know it's a fluke, but that shouldn't happen.
In any case, when it works it's fine, but it's not that great. Reiner has many far better auction games.

This game is wonderfully tense in an almost painful way.  The choices are not many, but they are difficult and the most difficult part is the caveat that the player with the least amount of money automatically loses.  That just hurts.  So, one often feels as if they've won, but may lose entirely because of a single card.  Great, classic game and yet another Gryphon game that is in regular play.  The bookshelf collection is one of the best sets of games out there for families and fillers for game groups.

Of [i]course[/i] I have this.  It's a great little filler, even with just three or four people, but supports more.  The ending has sort of a Cleopatra "Winner or dinner!" kind of aura, as you pretty much know everyone's points, but unless you're really paying attention, you don't know exactly everyone's remaining money.  New players almost always either get so conservative that they spend nothing and lose by VP, or forget about the money rule and end up losing that way.  But when they get to their second game, then they've figured it out.

Hated this game at first, but it grew on me a little in our latest couple of games... which we played just before its owner traded it away. I still think that the random ending is the big flaw in this game, which leaves it impossible to plan your strategy. Surely the random order of cards provides sufficient randomness to the game, even if it ended only once all the cards were out? An instance of that rare beast, a Knizia game that doesn't quite work.

High Society is a game that allows you an opportunity to risk your money - and possibly a nosebleed - as you attempt to reach great heights among the upper crust.  Here,   the auction mechanic is not merely a part of the game,  but the game itself.

In total,  there are only 16 cards ( 4 Red ) up for auction in the game.  There are some twists however,  which make this an interesting affair.  One of those,  is that the game ends immediately when the 4th red card comes up for auction.  This creates variable endings,  that while in part, you are able to gauge,  skews the predictability,  making it difficult to plan accordingly. 

The most important twist of all is the rule that the person with the lowest amount of money at game's end is ineligible for the win.  This helps reign in any possible free spender and creates a difficult balance between scoring and keeping enough money to be relevant.

The only downside to this game,  is that some games will resemble a diamond,  while others,  a cubic zirconia.   The games are short,  so I find it an acceptable trade-off for those experiences that end in a nail biting fashion.  Just realize,  that through no fault of your own,  it can be quite common to find yourself in a no win situation - but that's a small price to pay for the chance to mingle with the elite.

Quick and fun auction game.  Has three nice twists that make it interesting: 1) unknown game end timing, 2) no making change, and 3) automatic loss for the player with the least remaining cash at the end.  It has been quite a while since I last played this, however.  I just find that when reaching for a Knizia auction game, I'll always go for Ra first and Modern Art second while this stays on the shelf.  As a result I have traded it away to make some more space on the shelf.

What happen with the prior owner? Oh, he got busted by the IRS? Eh, that is sad, but it happens. Anyway, how much for it and do you take cash?

A great little auction game from Reiner Knizia. It packs way more tension and fun than I first thought it would, since its twist - the player with the least amount of money is eliminated - makes for some tense auctions, as you can't pay too much for things, but still has to take in some points and avoid problems!

7 after my first play (and following my first play of For Sale). Felt like I had more control and understanding in this game on what I would get for my money (comparing to For Sale) and a greater sense of player interaction. After the third red card was drawn calculations felt almost chess-like... unexpected but not bad!

I rate this as high as the auction trilogy.  Good bar game.  Fun with a twist, like all knizia games.  Great for non gamers.  Hard to value your decisions.  Hard to see what's coming.  Lots of ways to go about losing.  Every bid is agonizing.

I'm pretty much the only one who likes this game-- everyone else I play with seems to hate it, especially the wife, who doesn't dig the K-man's designs. Tricky, mathy, silly auction game-- great way to start or end a game night, except, you know, in my group.

Interesting and good themed auction game. Fast paced. Easy to LEARN, but difficult to manage for many people. The correation between cash and value is not explicit, and varies depending on the mindsets of the playing group. The complexity of the game is contributed by the specially designed combination of cash.
Players with poor finance quotients are very easily to drop into the pitfall spending too much money and lose the game immediately at the game end. Cautious players are however often over-cautious getting too few antiques at the presence of aggressive players in a multiple players game setting. The mixing of cautious and aggressive gamers with 5 players offers greatest degree of challenges to the game. I prefer to 5 players games, and like engaging games with very different gaming groups.
People with low finance managability may refuse to play this game. But it helps if they does play it. :>

This game is just simple but amazingly fun and tense. There are only two fillers that I absolutely love. This and Coloretto. At the heart of it, this game is an auction game ala Knizia. However, the simple mechanics lend itself to lots of subtlety and bluffing. I always have loads of fun teaching folks how to play this game.

Still love this classic filler. Absolutely one of the best

The economics of the game are very interesting.  Money wants to fly out of your hand in this game, and I was the guy who lost due to having the least money.  Obviously I bid too much, but worse than that, I ended up with only a single card at the end (The $20).

RATING: 8
This is an incredible game! Cards represent all the goodies of the world, your job is to collect the ones with the most point values and avoid negative values with your millions of dollars. BUT you cannot be the person with the least amount of money in your pocket when then final "RED" tile appears. You spent too much! The rest see who has the most for victory. All in one extremely entertaining package. Great for 3 players.

RATING: 8
Card game where you bid to acquire the most valuable collection of glamorous high-ticket items. Two very interesting and characteristic "Knizian" mechanisms are present - (1) your money cards are in specific denominations for which you can never obtain change, which means you have to be careful about how you bid with your small denominations, and (2) the player that ends the game with the lowest remaining bankroll automatically loses, regardless of whether he has the most valuable collection of stuff, so players can't just throw all their money for the most valuable items. Well designed and quick to play, but can be a little dry - "For Sale" should be the first choice in this niche of "auction fillers", but High Society is also excellent for a slight change.

Very nice light auction game with the "RK Twist."  The fixed denominations of $$$ and the need to keep enough Money until the end are subtle but really important touches.  Plays fast and is great show-boating!

RATING: 5
With 3 players, the game seems to be missing its potential, especially with the "lowest money automatically loses" rule; I don't think the bidding dynamics work well, since the prices don't get pushed up quickly enough.  With 5, though, the game really starts to take shape and develop into something interesting.  It has a unique element to quick bidding games in that there are cards you want and cards you don't want, but there are different auction methods for each.  I'm definitely interested in playing this one more.

I'm usually critical of Reiner Knizia's work because I feel that his games are clever and balanced, but they are often seriously lacking on the fun side of the equation. This particular offering manages to be greater than the sum of its parts. The very simple auction mechanics are given variety by the denomination limitations of the player's bidding cards and the reverse auctions where player's pay not to win bad tiles. These little oddities make High Society a very good game. Plus, it's fast! You can play this one in 10 to 15 minutes if everyone plays briskly. That makes it a very good filler and an even better nightcap.

Interesting bidding game that forces you to spend your money and make educated decisions, since you never know when the game will end. The poorest player looses and then the one with the most possessions wins. This means the skillful players must keep track of how much money the other players have and which cards are remaining to come up. Would love to play again.

Te-Chen has this game.

I like Knizia auctions. This one's portable and the theme is hilarious. Usually has at least one moment that "breaks" the table. Not the game, the players. With laughter, shock, etc. Anything that incites real emotion is good by me.

I could play better if I bothered to count what everyone else had spent, but that would surely take some of the edge out of the game. You shouldn't know for sure, damn it, you should be screwing up your eyebrows in consternation as everyone around you fiddles with their money cards.

Nice little game, esp. b/c of the length.  But...the ending is so unpredictable that it's impossible to make good choices early on. It's like Ra with a Ra track only three tiles long. Certainly it succeeds in terms of turn angst, but for all the calculating involved, I'd like a bit more control.

One of the more disappointing titles of the Good Doctor. It seems to be all about the one clever mechanic in the game, which simply isn't enough to make it a worthwhile game. As auction games go, he did a much better job with Modern Art, which is to be highly recommended over this one.

Quick bid/auction game. Identical bid value decks. Items come up for auction. No change, careful using your small denominations. Game randomly ends after fourth red auction item making it tough to ration your hand. Reminds me of Survivor food auctions. Clever twist to bid to avoid the bad effect cards that go to the lowest bidder. Player wins with highest value of items won at auction. But, the clever twist is they cannot have the lowest amount of money left over! I'm not typically a straight bid game but I like this one.

High Society is an auction game with some neat twists: some tiles are "negative" and players must bid to not win - the first player to pass wins the tile.  The game-end is triggered by a series of tiles that must all come up for auction, and the player at the end of the game with the least money automatically loses.  It is a great, fun, fast-playing game.

Played several times (with 3 to 5 players). A very pleasant filler. The uncertainty about the end game trigger could be a problem in a longer game, but it feels fine in such a short game. The elimination mechanism is a nice twist which, along with the impossibility to change the cards used to bid during a turn, definitely makes bidding very tense.

RATING: 7.5
Brutal game with three, since you could easily hold back cards and force the others to resign themselves to one of them having to lose. It's awkward holding their fates in your hand, which doesn't necessarily feel the same with 4 or 5. Still, for a light, quick-playing game, I really like it. And wish more games had the "least money auto-lose" condition worked in. It works well with the theme and the gameplay. Definitely would play again, though more than 3 would be preferable.

A fun kids' game.

With 3 players, it's not too difficult to keep tabs on which is your piece.  With 4, 5 or 6 players (if you get the expansion), it can be quite tough.

Quick to play, nice pieces, a good Christmas present for children aged from 3-8.

Own "Boo Who" version.  I think it will be okay to play with my daughter, but with adults, you abolutely rely on the plastic ghosts being indistinguishable from either other.  And mine aren't.

Update: Upgraded to 6.  It's fun tricking little kids...

Great family game. It is delightfully simple with a minimalist mechanic that works extremely well. Probably the only dice based racing game that's, well, not terrible. The game is aimed at kids, but in my opinion any great kids game is also inherently a great drinking game for adults. This game prooves just that.

[Children's Game] 
Excellent components, simple but elegant. A roll and move game with a memory element. This game is fun to play with kids and the ghosts are just plain cool! Certainly better with 3 or 4 players since the number of ghosts on the board will increase. I wouldn't play it with just two players since the game is all about player interaction and there just isn't enough of that with only two players. The best part of the game is trying to remember which ghost belongs to which player so having more players makes this a better game. However, the game certainly favors kids who can focus and remember which ghost has their pawn

4+, 2-4 players, best with 4, 15 mins. T's 3rd birthday. Exactly the same gameplay as On Your Broom. Expansion is Flaschengeist. This is an excellent memory game for 3 years and over. Simple but tricky. A lovely simple board and pieces. Have had some excellent games with O and T. Took quite a while to stop straightforward and practical T from just turning up his ghosts to see which one he might be moving! O on the other hand loves tricks and trickiness!

A childrens game that can be very difficult since it has a very strong memory factor. Most games played I simply lose track of where my ghost is, they just switch position too often, and this is why I am not giving it a higher score. But my kids (4 and 7) like it and are not as frustrated as I am.

I bought the US release version "Boo Who".  The game is essentially the same, but I was disappointed with the construction and bits.  the bits are all plastic and the board is poor quality.

Rated as a children game. 

The components are of great quality (rating +2). The magnetic pieces are neat (rating +1). The game is short and rules are light (rating +2). Sounds like a great game for kids? Not in my case. The box lists age 4-99, so I expected that the game would be interesting for a brother (6 years 2 months) and sister (8 years). I was wrong. Firstly, the game is no challenge for 8 years old. The game has a memory aspect but there are only four 4 pieces to keep track of. The 8 year old in question can remember the positions of about 10 pieces. OK, maybe everyone does not play the game Memory as often as she does but then again there are only 4 pieces and you have to focus only on one (your pawn). I think that most 8+ kids can easily do this (rating -2). Secondly, the game is competitive (not co-op) and relies too much on skill - i.e. memory - instead of luck. This means that the kids playing it must be of the same age. Otherwise the younger ones will lose most of the games. Oops! (rating -4)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very fun game to play with kids - especially when the ghost is rolled frequently.  I move whatever ghost is bringing up the rear to try to keep all the ghosts close together which makes it much harder to keep track of who's who when the exchanging takes place.  My 7 y.o. kept getting upset that we were moving him to the rear until at the end of the game he found out that he wasn't who he thought he was.  Great components, fun game for kids.  Plays quickly in about 10 minutes.
Edit:  After 10 plays, the kids are getting really good at remembering who their ghost is.  It helps to be playing with the full complement of 4 people because this keeps all the ghosts moving along at a more even pace (rather than them moving only their ghost with me trying to move mine plus the "dummy" ghosts to keep things interesting).  With 2 or 3 people, it is a less interesting game.

Ingenius little memory/movement game.  Learn it in 2 minutes.  

Rating is from family perspective.  Teaches memory and strategy.  As soon as the ghosts are all out, the kids need to strategize which player is the best to trade when the ghost is rolled again.  

Plays in less than 10 minutes.

RATING: 7
A fun combination of a roll-and-move race game and memory.  Players have to remember whose pawn is under which ghost,  which is difficult because the ghosts keep switching around.  Often you end up advancing someone else's pawn by mistake.  The game is simple enough for 3-4 year olds, fun for all ages and plays quickly.

Egyszerű dobj és lépj játék egy kis szellemes memória résszel megfűszerezve. Egészen kis korban el lehet kezdeni vele a játékot. Habár az én 4 éves kislányom rendszeresen figyelmen kívül hagyja a "szellem cserét" és továbbra is azzal lép tovább amelyikről úgy gondolja, hogy az övé volt előzőleg. Aztán a célban van nagy meglepődés :). Viszont úgy gondolom, hogy a túl egyszerűsége miatt hamar ki fogja nőni. A felnőtteknek nem annyira izgalmas, kivéve ha több egymást követő "szellem dobás" következtében jól össze tudják keverni a sorrendet, hogy a végén már senki nem tudja ki melyik szellemmel van. Az elég mókás. Nagy előnye a rövidsége, ami ideálissá teszi a kisgyermekek számára, akik még nem tudnak sokáig megülni egy helyben. (2017.04.09)

Looking for a game for a 3 year old that can amuse the parents too? Don't look any longer! This is it! Super confusing, funny and surprising. (The ghosts are really clever.) Check it out! It's actually brilliant! 
Note: 8 is because it's a game for very young children and for them it's an 8, for a grown up it's a 4 or 5 (because we're not the target audience).

If I was rating Geistertreppe for what it truly is, a children's game, my rating would be an 8 or 9.  Although it can offer quick fun for adults, Geistertreppe's place in my collection, as of now, is entirely due to it being a visually stunning game.  I truly appreciate the aesthetic design and intend someday, if and when all circumstances are right, to play this enthusiastically with my yet to be created family.  Until then however I will rate this game solely on it's merits in opposition to other race games I have played.  The memory element is interesting, and can offer some head scratches if playing after a few drinks (or when old age has begun to settle in), otherwise this is just a rather simple, nothing to write home about, experience.

Rating for kids game.
Spooky stairs is a funny children memory/race game.  The goal of the game is to move your pawn all the way to the top of the stairs.  On your turn you roll the special dice.  This dice have number from 1 to 4 on it and 2 side with a ghost.  When you roll a number, you move a pawn of your choice that many spaces.  When you roll a ghost, you have to cover one of the pawn with a larger white ghost pawn.  Once the 4 player pawn are cover with ghosts (and can't be tell apart), when you roll a ghost, you must switch the position of two pawn.
The game ends when a pawn reach the last space of the stairs.  The winner is the player whose pawn ended the game.  You can have a surprise when revealing the colour under the ghost!
There is also a advanced variant that, when you roll a ghost, instead of switching the pawn on the board, you can switch your colour with another player!  This variant will really test your memory because you'll have to remember every pawn colour position on the board!

RATING: 5
A children's race game, but add the two variants rules, and this becomes a fun, quick, party-like filler for adults. There isn't much of a challenge here: you roll your die, and move your meeple. The wrinkle is that if the ghost symbol shows up on the die, your meeple is "covered" by a ghost figure (where the magnet on top of your meeple is picked up by a screw on the inside of the ghost figure--very clever). Eventually, all the meeples are covered, and that's when the fun begins. Anytime thereafter if a ghost is rolled, the player may: switch any two ghosts (and switching the order on the stairs), or switch his/her player color with another (thereby switching ownership of two ghosts). If this happens several times, it is guaranteed confusion and whackiness as to who owns what ghost! As the owner put it: a crazy shell game.

Update (01/20/12) '7' was my initial rating. Upon a long period of reflection, it is a '5'.

Light children's game where players try to get their pawn to the top of the stairs first.

The basic version doesn't really work as a game for adults; the only way you could lose track of your piece is if someone moved it while you weren't looking or couldn't see. With the advanced version the game is a little trickier since you have to keep track of all four pieces, but this still means the game's one complication is that you might lose track of your piece and effectively make random moves for the rest of the game.

Bought as a future gift. Now if only those pesky kids would just grow up!Tried it out with my gf on a whim. We took two colours each and played with the "disc swap" rule. Boy, did you get confused easy. I managed to lose track of my pawns both games we played, and she did not do much better. Will be fun trying it out with her nephews, rumour has it they have the game at kindergarden -- I try to brace myself for the inevitable defeat & post-game ridicule ;)

RATING: 5
Owned the Boo Who? version which was quite nice from a components perspective.  Overall found it a bit boring as compared to some other children's games.  This one does play better with younger children maybe 5-7 years old but as our son was turning 8 even he was less enamored with simple roll and move games.  The theming here is a bit exaggerated as your just covering pawns with the ghosts and trying to remember which is yours.  Ultimately it saw little play as it got labeled "That Halloween Game" which rarely got played other times.  Also maybe we just all have better memories than the average gamer, but we found it entirely too easy on average to keep track of where our pawn was.  In fact it really isn't memory so much as just keeping your eyes on where your piece is (focusing) which means the game works best if your kids are hoping around not paying full attention and/or the adults are drinking/laughing etc.  Taken seriously with everyone watching the board there is little game here.

Fun kids game where everything gets quite mixed up and you are not sure who is who or who will win until someone does. Very cleaver use of magnets and pawns to keep everyone guessing who is under which ghost. The expansion adds an good way to avoid a runaway leader by - what else - trapping the ghost in a bottle of course.

This is a fantastic game and not just for kids! Or family love everything about it, the playing time, the level playing field with kids, the confusion, the components and artwork. So simple and yet so clever! Easily among our favourite kid's games. It's fun for all ages - even the grandparents loved this one. We actually purchased a second copy and used dots on the pawns to make them look different. That way we can play with up to 8 players on an extended board (two levels) for even more fun confusion!

Rated as a kids game.  Boo Who version.  Very quick fun game to p[lay with kids.  Probably not so fun with just adults.  I act as moderator when I play with my kids, keeping the game moving very quickly which makes it a little more challenging(especially if 3 or 4 people roll the ghost in a row).  I find keeping the game moving quickly makes it much mroe enjoyable for me.

Boo Who?

Spooky stairs

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Interesting kids game of racing up stairs in a castle.  The catch is once you become haunted, or killed for more mature players, then your pawn is covered with a ghost.  All the ghosts are the same so at this point it's about trying to remember which ghost is yours.  Easier said than done and this is where it gets tricky.  Once you're ghosted you can move any ghost pawn so the question is are you moving your pawn forward or someone else's?  You second guess yourself once someone moves your ghost or what you think is your ghost...

Would like to try with the expansion which allows up 6 players and adds a new rule.

It's a roll-and-move memory game essentially. You need to keep track where your own piece is hidden. I'm forgetting where mine is the moment last piece is covered with a ghost.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Another huge hit with my youngest daughter (she's now 6), this game has been played a bunch in my house but I only record my own plays of games. I was originally apprehensive to get Spooky Stairs because of the memory element, but in this game it just adds to the fun one you are moving a ghost sure that it's yours and then you find out it wasn't. The game plays quick enough that it never becomes frustrating even when that happens. Overall a great game that all of my kids have fun playing, because of this Spooky Stairs is one of those rare children's games that will stay on my shelf for years to come. I can't recommend this game enough if you have young children.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The first memory game that I have found that is a blast to play, even if your memory is awful (which mine is).
- Typical amazing component quality from Drei Magier Spiele, everything is much bigger than I imagined (especially the board and ghosts). 
- This game looks awesome when it is set up, it really is inviting to children.
- Another game that is engaging not only to my 5 yo daughter, but also my older kids (13 and 10).[/i]

Rated as a kids game.

This is a horror game, not because of the cute little ghosts or the nice stairs, but because of the feeling of dread when you realize just how bad your memory is.
Basically each player has a pawn that has to reach the top of the stairs in order to win. On you turn you roll a die and move your pawn up the stairs. If you roll a ghost (2/6 sides) you put one of four identical ghost covers on your pawn. Then you just have to remember which ghost is yours.
Then someone switches the ghosts around...
Then someone switches you to another color...

Rated for kids. Have the Boo Hoo edition which looks even better than the original. Interesting how BGGers give Geistertreppe lots of cred, but I haven't heard much fuss about an affordable American version (Boo Hoo). May show BGGers reverse-discrimination in action. This is a great kids game, a no-brainer to pick up from Amazon for less than $10. I'm strongly considering picking up another copy, so that we can change the colors of the other set and be able to play up to 8, with the bonus of an extra die! (meaning more and furious die-rolling, leading to harder-to-remember pieces) A 3D map, made with Heroscape terrain would be pretty slick, too, after seeing the 2005 demo 3D picture in the Gallery.

This game seems so simple, yet accomplishes so many things! 
It is supposed to be a kids game, so it would be good to help in skill developement. Does it do it? YES! Concentration and memory issues seem to be very often nowadays and this one hits right at the spot.
A general problem with kids game is that adults need to lower their performance so kids can play competitively. No issue here! It will test your memory and concentration as much as it test theirs! They may even win from time to time due to someone moving the wrong ghost but they will snatch some well deserved victories too!
Hey! But wouldn't you get pissed by losing due to your little one did not paid enough attention and ended up driving mom's pawn (or even worse mom's mom's pawn!) to victory? If you do you got serious issues man, you probably need to see a doctor. Such things happens a lot, but guess what? It is hillarious!
It's a dice game! Roll and move! Wouldn't it mean good dice rolls can make the winner? Not at all. The ghost exchange mechanism ensures that every single player will have his chance for a last minute victory, assuming he was paying enough attention!
This is a gem, maybe an overcosted one, but still. My girls enjoy it every time, and every non gamer that has coem at our home and seen them play is impressed by it. And imagine that I haven't yet activated the disc exchange rule, as it would raise the difficulty too much for them (yes, yes and me...).
I thought of giving it an 8 but you know what, I realised it is even better. Get this one.

One of the simplest Drei Magier Spiele's games sombining roll and move with the fun of magnets. 

It's a simple roll and move race game with the trick of people forgetting which one of the pawns is theirs (as they're hidden under ghost's sheet). Certain die results let you switch the position of two ghosts on the table. That's it. 

With kids this proved to be a game of utter chaos and concentration and laughter - kinda intermixed. With adults we tried the harder variant (switching also the ownership of pawns), but somehow the harder variant is easier - when you concentrate more you don't lose the concentration, when you focus less, oops. 

One of the better role and move games for smaller kids. Neat. (and they get some memory skill exercise)

[22 plays] I'll give this a 9-10 for the target audience which is little kids and a 6-7 for adults, so the average rating ends up at an 8. The components are gorgeous and clever, the gameplay is surprisingly interesting for a roll and move type game, and it plays so quickly that the simplicity is forgivable for adults.

I'm rating this as a game for 4yos, as it is being marketed as.

Though this is one of the few games that are playable by 4yos _and_ fun for adults, it wasn't a success with my 4yo. The great pawn-inside-the-ghost thing actually seemed to put my kid off, and he definitely was not ready for the gotcha element of it, which caused major meltdown. He reacted as if I'd hit him. It saw almost no play for a year and a half. Now 6yo, my kid has shown renewed interest and seems to really enjoy it. He taught it to his neighbor friend today, and they had a blast.

So as a game for 6y+, I'd rate it higher. 

If your 4yo (or even younger) sees older kids or adults play it, I can imagine (s)he could be drawn in by the game. Just watching it, it's hide-and-seek and peekaboo on a board, after all. But if you're looking for a game to play alone with your 4yo, I'd wait with this, and go for e.g. Max by Jim Deacove of Family Pastimes instead, or the original edition of Gulo Gulo, if you can find it (not the 2015 Pharaoh retheme, which is aimed at older kids).

Cute roll and move game mixed with the classic shell game.  You don't think that there are going to be any surprises, but soon you start losing track of things and then there is some anticipation.

This isn't all that great for adults, but it would be really fun to play with kids.

Reading the rules, it seemed too light. As it happens, it's really a shell game with a roll and move veneer. It can be really difficult to keep track of your figure when they are all are hidden by ghosts and their positions are exchanged. It's a big hit with my niece and nephew. Playing with the rules for older children, this is usually a laugh getter with adults.

A great kids' game, that cleverly combines two perennial elements of many childrens' games: memory and roll and move. When the kids get a bit older, you can use the variant where players can also exchange their colour tokens, adding much confusion. This variant is very suitable for adults as well.

[Drei Magier Spiele 2003 edition] {Horror, kid; roll-and-move, memory} {adult 5.5, kid 7} Geistertreppe is an interesting and thematic children game. Children have fun in transforming the figures into ghosts and swapping the figures. Strong memory is helpful in this game.
Essentially, it's a roll-and-move game but the designer adds memory mechanic and other tactics to the game. Therefore, it's not just a luck driven game. It's a very nice game to have if not expensive.  

The components are big, sturdy and very attractive. However, it's easy to leave marks on the white background of the ghosts. Then, players may be able to a ghost.

[Expansion] The expansion, Flaschengeist, is a must if you like this game. The bottle and the new variant is good. Besides, it can make 4p game more fun. I particularly prefer players can exchange the discs. It makes the game more fun!

I have upped my rating. This is a light, children's' game that has been a go-to for years.  Easy rules and simply fun to play.  I don't pay attention so well and then get confused as to which ghost is mine.  Then, I get duped.  We usually play a couple times and put it away for a couple months.  Worth it if it's not too expensive.

Not a game of skill, but there are definitely some laughs in store. All pawns quickly become ghosted, and, if you are not paying attention to which is your pawn, you could easily end up moving somebody else's. The boys had fun playing this game twice, but I'm not sure how many more times we will end up playing it. Nice artwork and components, just not much game.

Cute game for little children with excellent components.  Some challenge can be added for 6-8 year olds by allowing them to switch tokens on a ghost roll, but mostly this is for the pre-school and kinder set.

Rated for play with 3- or 4-year-olds.  For adults, it's a 3 rating or less.

Rated as a Children's Game

Fun and quick little roll and move, with a memory twist.  Works well with 2 and 4 year old.  The memory element makes it slightly interesting.  Usually it's not that hard to keep track of the pieces, but every now and then it'll surprise you.

Fun game for kids, and easy enough to be playable at quite a young age.  Clever, but ultimately it is just roll and move with a basic memory element added, so I can't see this having tremendous staying power for adults.

As a game to play with children, this is ok, if not terribly exciting. It is really a question of whether you can memorize where your pawn is or not. There is no middle ground, or if there is, it comes down to the luck of the dice roll.

Fun game to play with children. Played a lot the last week with my 3 1/2 year old son. A lot of lessons for him in anger management and counting. *** UPDATE: My son has now turned 4. The game works very well to play with him. He has stopped cheating by peeking ´beneath the ghost. He is able to win and graciously faces defeat. He still has small problems counting the steps even though he can count to 20. Most important of all he is enjoying the game and has a fun time gaming.

This game is beautiful with gorgeous components. In addition, it is fun to play even for adults (provided the game is played with at least four players).
It is very chaotic, but in a very funny kind of way.
The only drawback to the game, is that the ghosts get marked easily (and that might ruin the game a bit). Play with the expansion (Flaschengeist) for some great added rules. Even with these rules added, it was easy to grasp for my five year old son.
If you play this with two, be sure to add four ghosts to the setup and start swapping discs!

I have the Boo Who edition and it was a hit with my 4 year old daughter and a group of 4 friends I showed it to this past weekend.  Of all the games with me, a friend wanted to borrow this one to entertain some nieces coming over this week.  Sadly, I had only one copy and knew my daughter would want to play it again soon.  Just ordered a second copy, either to make my own 6-player game or to give to my brother's family as a gift.  (Watch out though, people may try to point the ghost's face at themselves to track which one is theirs... I try to thwart that technique with my deft sleight-of-hand swapping/rotation maneuver.)  I have bought 5 copies of this so far!

Cute fun for kids. Goofy filler fun for adults, especially if impairment (poor memory, or chemical) makes it hard to remember which ghost is yours.

The Shell Game:  The Boardgame

For such a simple roll & move game, this is remarkably fun.  The ghost swapping happens frequently enough to really mess people up, and playing with the advanced variant that allows for color swapping would make this even trickier.

What a great and incredibly funny game. It's simple enough that 4-year olds can play, yet fun enough for adults to enjoy. This game tests your memory skills in a highly entertaining way, as you try to remember under which ghost your pawn is hidden, but that's not all, you must also track where everyone else's pawns are hiding, as someone may switch colors with you at any moment.

The game plays incredibly fast, and is a blast from start to finish.

I highly recommend that you also add the expansion, as it makes this game even more fun.

Very nice kid's game that's also fun to play for parents. Simple rules that still require some skill for kids - memory, decisions whcih ghosts to swap. My 4.5 year old didn't had any problem to pick up the rules. The only problem we had - quite nasty "take that" element of ghost swapping, hard to accept for a child when one step away from the victory.

After one play (of : seems a little chaotic, but played much quicker than I thought it would.  I'll have to try some of the larger scenarios before I have a firm opinion.

Kinda of neat - a provisional 7. The jury is still out as I am not sure if the series has enough replayability or depth to hold my interest. My worry is the fleet conflict playability has been taken to a point where the action, strategy and tactics are kind of vanilla and not interesting enough to want to come back to. Haven't tried the cards yet that in Serpent of the Seas.

I've chosen the first scenario to play believing it to be the introductory scenario hovere it seems I've jumped into something with a few too many rules to reference, making it appear to flow slower than I would like for my first experience.

RATING: 7
Too painful for big fleet actions - I think this has more
little finicky stuff than WSIM. Certainly more than Fighting
Sail - yet is supposed to handle bigger actions.
The support for fleet command rules is not sufficient either.

So far, this game has produced one of my most unpleasant
solo gaming experiences ever. A huge disappointment overall.


Update: I've learned to cope with the mechanical issues
(writing most counter info on paper), and its become tolerable. 
Too much detail on individual ships for my taste - but 
so long as one side breaks early, it's not too terrible.

NEEDS MORE DEVELOPMENT. Missing: turn-order card, move/LOS player-aid card, larger print ship counters, etc. Supposed to be SIMPLER than WS&IM: no plotting mvmt-, same ship speeds+, "rates" to "simplify" guns..... Fiddly number counters and check-off boxes should be upgraded to a rigging and hull "score-track" or euro "cubes". I-GO-U-GO not right for naval?

RATING: 7.5
This game has an odd feel to it. I rather appreciate that it is directed more towards fleet actions and, as such, the individual ship mechanics are at a high level. However, these ARE individual ships and at times I found their abstracted mechanics a bit too clumsy. Kind of difficult to put my finger on just why that is...perhaps because the game lives in that borderland between being fleet focused and ship focused? Given that there has been some significant retooling of the rules since it first appeared has not dampened my uneasiness.

That being said, I still enjoy it. Who wouldn't like to inflict broadsides, grapple, etc.? For me it is a beer and pretzels sort of game; just sit back and start shooting.

The Living Rules are a must.

2015-08-06: Having played several games now both PBEM and live, I can see the appeal of this system.  Unlike Close Action, this game will let you play large battles in a single game-day all the way to completion.  The game is not centered around a balanced outcome, but rather the British enjoy a rather large advantage in the game, both on firepower and typically on their ability to avoid breaking.  There are some scenarios where this is an exception.  I wonder if the game's victory conditions could be re-vamped a la Musket and Pike to reflect victory point levels that might allow a player to "win" the game, while losing the battle.  Hmmmm.  In any case, it's a solid entry in tactical/grand tactical Age of Sail gaming.  Thanks Phil!

I think this is an excellent, accessible, and very playable simulation game that combines solid details with the right amount of abstraction to keep it clean and elegant without bogging down into minutiae.  Flying Colors is a lot of fun to play, which is sort of rare for this sort of game, which all too often winds up "interesting" or "fascinating" from a historical or thematic perspective but not really much of a good time.  The game really captures a nice since of Age of Sail fighting and when you look on the map at 20 or more ships in your fleet and you're in control of the whole thing, it's awesome but never overwhelming.  You can practically smell the smoke and hear the cannons.  As far as this game's detractors go, comparing it to Close Action is pretty silly, that's like comparing Memoir 44 to Advanced Squad Leader- two games that set out to accomplish two different things.  I really don't understand why people feel the need to criticize a game for not being another game, that makes no sense.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to do Napoleonic fleet-scale battles but doesn't want to invest an unreasonable amount of time and energy into the subject.

Recently I grew fascinated with knowledge about the Age of Sail.  I knew so very little, and much of the terminology was opaque to me.  Acquired a diverse set of resource/research books and period adventures like C.S. Forester's "Horatio Hornblower" series(of which I just finished "Flying Colors" while in Maui). 

This game is to have fun at the fleet tactics of this age.  Compared this game by GMT against a wide set of choices including "Wooden Ships & Iron Men", and "Heart of Oak" and decided that it does well for the mechanics that I think are important in order to simulate this era. Both Rindis and Attilla66 would give it a shot. So I expect to have a session report soon.  Could work as a group game too!

A masterpiece simulation of naval warfare in the age of Nelson (along with it's sister game Blue Cross White Ensign).  A game on what is possibly my favourite theme, this has rendered AH's Wooden Ships & Iron Men obsolete, although WSIM still lurks somewhere in my loft! Plays solitaire very well with not too much fiddly book keeping. Plenty of scenarios and well written rules. There have been plenty of comments about counter clutter, but that doesn't bother me.

I have been playing this one a lot recently, having visited HMS Victory in Portsmouth with my son for the umpteenth time last month and we also visited Cape St Vincent in Portugal the scene of Nelson's first triumph., It's a very evocative place if you stand on the cliff edge above the crashing waves, gazing out to sea ... you can almost see Nelson's squadron looming out of the sea mist to take on the Spaniards!

Shame I can't get hold of a copy of Serpents of the Seas to complete the series which includes the much sought after tactical cards.

Very enjoyable fleet action game from the age of sail. Captures the feel very well in a just about playable length of time. The 'breaking away' and defensive fire rules are a little bit under-developed. Would prefer the CRT to be based on a 2-dice role rather than single (d10) one.

RATING: 4
Tentative comments based on a demo game. 

This is another naval game in the Napoleonic era, though it encourages larger fleet actions. Instead of programming, you take turns activating squads of ships. I was lucky enough to test out a new variant with cards, and these really give a great flavor for details like morale, special situations, and so on and don't really increase the rulebook. These cards really bring the game up a notch in fun and flavor. 

Ultimately I'm afraid Flying Colors occupies an uncomfortable place. On the one hand it is simpler than WSIM or Close Action which is definately a good thing. But there are still an awful lot of charts and modifiers that make game play pretty slow. The simplifications might not have gone far enough for me. I feel like the Close Action gives a better payoff at teh expense of a few more rules, as does an entirely gutted simplification like Man o'War. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is a lot of cool stuff going on in this game, it is just a little too fiddly for me.  That could possibly be overcome with a better tracking system and/or a bigger map.  It was fun to rake two ships at once.  Definitely has the potential to go up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Had trouble with it at first, mainly because I tried the Trafalgar scenario.  Having gone back and played a smaller scenario a couple of times, I am quite pleased with the game.  Compared with WS&IM, you will notice the absence of the wooden island which dominates all but the smallest WS&IM scenarios.  Tacking procedure is also a great improvement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple game system and has a beer-and-pretzels feel to it. Players roll dice blasting at one another, then roll more dice to see who strikes, sinks etc. Ok if you're in the mood for that sort of thing. I think that at the end of the day, a decent Age of Sail ship-to-ship combat needs the pre-plotting a la WS&IM to convey the elements of strategy of Age of Sail warfare.

Falls short in comparison with either Wooden Ships and Iron Men and Close Action:

-the removal of gun hits in FC is a marginal complexity reduction, but a significant realism problem.

-the ships do not have enough manpower hits available-one lucky low-table hit can drop 25-33% of a ship's manpower.  However, manpower has no impact on gunnery!?  After 2-3 manpower hits, the hits become no-effect (a wasted hit)?!

-non-plotted I-GO/U-GO; okay, good from a no log-keeping perspective, but it really takes just as much time, and allows gaps in the line to develop purely due to who won initiative, and who has more commands.  Also, 4-5 ships can blast a target, because 'they moved first'.  Finally, add in stern and bow rakes that wouldn't happen with simultaneous movement.  The optional rule to allow defensive fire every MP would stop some of this, but then the game would actually be slower than both WSIM and Close Action.  Note that the WSIM rule that you must fire at the closest target also prevents some the above rake issues.

-The French/rigging British/hull bonus is not supported historically, as far as I know.  The French shot at rigging more than the British, but I don't know that they were 'better at it'.

-'audacity' and 'in chains' are kind of irritating; crew skill rating and 'in irons' would be preferable.  Note that 'in chains' is fixed in the errata, but doesn't fix my components.

-Age of sail ships had one gun crew to man both broadsides; WSIM prevents re-loading both broadsides in the same turn; no mention in FC.

-For the good; admirals and commands is a good thing, and prevents some of the a-historical things that occur from time-time in WSIM.  Optional rules in General volume 25/number 4 allow for this in WSIM.

-for the good, named ship counters takes some of the generic feel out of a battle.

-not for the good; attempting to play without a ship log results in a pile of counters following (and obscuring) all of the ships on the board.

-not for the good; the guy on the cover of the box.

Final analysis:  I think adding command and control rules to WSIM or playing Close Action (with enough people) would be preferable on most occasions to FC.

Keep in mind; the basic rules for WSIM are 7 pages, with all optional rules, they are 12 pages.  FC is 14 pages.  FC setup is quicker, if you don't have ship logs prepared in advance, but I don't see the game really being quicker.

This is my first sea warfare game and so far it provides a complete different experience. Only 10 pages of rules but very challenging! Not as intuitive as operational land warfare due to wind, command, status but interesting and replayable.
Make sure you have enough time & space for the bigger battles as you require three maps. 

A different experience but not more than that. Like railway games,I guess I am not a sea- nor an air wargamer.

Flying Colors is age of sail combat at fleet level simply stated. This is a naval game that isn't stripped down to the idiotic level of a collectible minis game and not jacked up to the level of a PHD's analysis of naval warfare disguised as a game. Plays reasonably quick and is rewarding. Large engagements are do-able in a single session. A little long on playing time but a decent game.

Didn't like defensive fire. At all. Fire can only be triggered by firing yourself: so you can sail across a broadside into a rake position without having to take the opposing ship's broadside. There is a variant in there to fix it, but it didn't seem very inspiring. Pre-plotted movement is cumbersome but surely the way to go for Age of Sail (I need to try Close Action).

Update: apparently the optional rules do greatly improve this, so I'm willing to try it again.

PbeM suitability: quite high, although defensive fire frequently necessitates redoing the whole of the rest of the log owing to changed factors (this is probably worse with the optional rule).

A good solid game that covers the basics of combat in the Age of Sail.  The games mechanics are streamlined enough so that larger battles can be fought in a reasonable amount of time unlike more complicated games such as WS&IM or Close Action.

Great fun for squadron and fleet actions.  Makes scenarios that were unplayable without large teams in WSIM very playable for two players.

Get the living rules.  They have greatly benefited from input from afficinados on the subject.  The core game rules do not work as well for ship vs. ship actions, but Serpents of the Seas resolves that issue nicely with the addition of a card-based activation system.

As beer and pretzels as anything else.  Jonathan Dowd-Gailey's comments on the effect of the hull/rigging targeting bonuses and the lack of significance to manpower hits resonate with my experience of the game.  The command rules are very wonky and are in need of house rules, lest one wind up with such unusual situations as a large fleet being unable to execute a turn (because all ships in a formation must face the same direction).  Overall, it feels underdeveloped and in need of more work before it's ready for primetime.  Also, I felt the play aids could have been much better - some of the material would have been better served by being presented in diagram form. (such as a simple diagram showing the wind direction, the label for each facing and the mps available)

I like most of the game except for 3 things
-Too difficult to sink a ship.  I know rules 1.5 where changed to make it more realistic and sink less ship, but sometimes realism kills the fun.  Shooting full salva 5 times at a ship and still see it sailing...

-Melee: Totally confusing rule there and all that for a simple die roll at the end.

- The lenght.  This is the major issue.  I I really thought most scenarios would play quickly, but even a single map/7 ships scenario took 4 hours.  

If those don't sound like major issues to you, get the game! The rest of the rule are nicely done.

The strong point of this game is it has a high solitaire suitability rating.  A fellow wargamer commented: Close Action is to Star Fleet Battles as Flying Colors is to Full Thrust. 17 historical scenarios covering the battles in the age of sail: the Seven Years War, the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.  Also refer to Serpents of the Seas for more naval actions in the series. Each counter represents a single ship and when the counters line up on the sea, certainly you can see what a grand fleet action is all about. Plus you can imagine yourself being one in the same ship where the admiral is standing to give out commands, as the ship moves serenely into the wind and misty fog.  

The rules take you a while to absorb, not to mention the different types of naval movements according to the wind direction.  Once mastered, the rules are not that tough as they seem.  A great thing about this game is that many naval ships are included, individually named and assigned the relative (fire) rate and hull value.  A ship is damaged when the hull value is reduced to zero and it is flipped to the damaged side.  To maximise the fire for effect, it all comes down to out-maneuver to rake fire, inflicting double hull damage.  

The game is basically designed for two players, although it certainly can be played by more, say up to 4 players.  The ships are assigned into group and formation and so they can be easily divided among players.  Although I can say the system is quite simple at its core, the number of ships in a scenario does require you to complete the game in 6 hours.  For example, the basic scenario Minorcra sees both the British and French having 12 to13 ships in action at the same time. But it is already the most efficient naval system in the market that can complete fleet actions in a single afternoon! 

Quite a common problem with wargame at individual scale, be it either naval or air, is that it might take the players to drive ships or planes around the ocean or sky for a long time and all it comes down to missing shots 95% of the time.  For example, in [thing=3608][/thing], dogfight might take more than normal if neither side can catch the tail of the enemy planes. Similarly for [thing=1589][/thing].  I think the joy comes from the experience in figuring out the way to do something that can deliver the blow, be it ultimate or not.  A streamlined process, and I emphasis "streamlined", not ironing out all the details, can be found in [thing=8730][/thing] and the game is very successful on that aspect.  The players are "zoomed-in" to the actual battles, and into fire exchange  quickly after some maneuvers. It is this "draw-in" view and experience that the game scores a very high mark.  The best tactical naval game for the Age of Sails in my view.

Quick play, bad history.   Takes an admittedly excellent game (the original [b]Fighting Sail[/b]), carries it into a scope (big fleet battles) where it does not work, and also removes Fighting Sail's most innovative aspect (the historically accurate 8-point movement), replacing it with hexes, a step back if I ever saw one.  The command system is megaphone-based and does not lead to historical tactics - big fleets can't even execute turns in succession.  I must laugh when I read that "forward thinking commanders like Nelson could retain control of their fleets" - completely ahistorical - what Nelson did was maneuver to get the best advantage for engaging, and then trust his commanders.   In all his victories he exercised almost zero control after ships entered the fray.  The bizarre situations that develop from the sequence of movement (ships ganging up one other or sailing through a gap because they "move first") show again that IGO-YOUGO is not a usable system for naval games, at least at these scales.   Flash without depth.  Finally, giving each side apriori bonuses for what one side did for specific reasons and the other side may actually not have done...

If I don't want to go to the detail of [b]Close Action[/b] and instead want to go for a fleet level battle game that reflects history  I'll go for SimCan's [b]Man of War[/b] (soon out again from Omega) rather than this.

I'd love to have that list of scenarios, but just not in this game.

Purchased from Mike Greenwood's estate (10-2009). Played a "learning" game with Garrett. We got through 5 turns of the Minorca scenario. The game was very fiddly with the chits. I have an idea for fixing that...stay tuned.

Update (12/30/2009) - Played with Donovan & Corey. Less fiddly now with my card system...though still a lot to track. I really like this game. I've upgraded my rating to an "8" It takes awhile to play, but more experience would probably whittle that down significantly.

Jeez this is one sweet system.  Opened the box and was trading broadsides within 5 minutes.  No record keeping, no preplotting, no paperwork period.  Unfortunately the first edition rules were quite screwed up (version 1.5 is a VAST improvement, though still not perfect) Setup is a pain, as the scenario only lists the ships' names, not other useful info like rate or damage capacity. Still, a wonderful game.

This is the age of sail game I've always wanted but didn't know it until I played it.  Incredible f2f or in person, very evocative of the period without drowining in the detail of how many men in the sheets or below deck.

Dec '16:  Finally got in an engagement.  It is definitely more streamlined, which for once is a good thing for me.  I know nothing about tactics of sail, and it shows in my play, but in a way the game forces you to do not too stupid maneuvers, so that helps.  Took a while to get started, but then it flows pretty nicely and is quite a bit of fun.  But twenty turn scenarios?  Yipes!

RATING: 6
A fleet-level age of sail game that's had some post-production growing pains, even though it began life as a DTP before GMT picked it up. A number of my initial concerns (sudden death if the flagship strikes, for example) have been addressed through subsequent rules patches. I think it's evolved into something playable and fun, though historical is another question. The command/activation rules are probably the biggest culprit here, as are the instant tactical reactions enabled by sequential movement. The formation rules have a few quirks that make it impossible for a mediorcre commander--precisely the guy who *should* be keeping to the formation--to maintain a line of battle through a simple turn. And ships *still* sink much too easily.

One big plus: overhead is non-existent. No written preparation whatsoever, just set up the ships, dump the markers out in the box lid, and away you go. It also plays well solo. 

Get the living rules as there's a lot of picky errata, especially in the scenario set ups.

Great Age of Sail game. Easy to learn and abstracted  enough to handle fleet based scenarios while still retaining the flavor of WS&IM. Out of the box this game is an 8. It becomes a solid 9 with the addition of the ship cards plus player aid files in the BGG files area, and the living rule book. The game becomes a solid 10 with the addition of the Serpents of the Sea expansion. I'm rating it a 9 because I feel the game is a little underrated. It can feel a little light if you create your own ship to ship scenarios (for which Close Action may best fill the need).

However, the movement system (while fairly realistic) seems pretty heavy and time consuming for a game that focuses on fleet level game play.

Easy to learn, difficult to master. single ship scenarios play rapidly. Larger scenarios are where the system really shines. My gaming group tolerate my addiction to this game, as I tend to bring out food, grog and sound effects to add atmosphere. The latter doesn't work for some of the group, who head for the hills when they see me talking like a pirate and bringing out salted meats and cheese rounds. Game is very well supported by the designer and others with an interest in this area. Incredibly envious of those with actual ship models - maybe one day I will indulge myself!

Bought at a very comfortable price (45 EUR), I have very mixed feelings about this.

Yes I get it, the broad scope; but then, why this stacking madness? Oh yes - you can book-keep it on paper, but I have better games that do the same ([url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7782/ship-o-line]Ship O' the Line[/url] to say one), and it's a bit odd nonetheless given that the game is "advertised" as a fast fleet game that requires no b-k. The whole command radius is quite nonsense to me: even Nelson fixed a broad plan ahead leaving the single Captains free to act.

Fact is, the game equalizes all the ships' values, coupled with the always problematic 6-directions movement, so it becomes a matter of who rolls better on the ever-changing (by Designer) damage table (and what does it mean, no more Manpower hits with the last revision?!).

Still it's the only large fleet game on the topic that I own and a forced buy given my love for the Age of Sail era.

With some custom houseruling it's a good game, otherwise it's only average. A missed occasion, and that's a pity.

- First impressions: After getting accustomed with the naval movement rules (i'm usually a panzer or army pusher) the game played out rather dull and abstract: simply IGO-UGO, no secret planning or plotting, more or less obvious choices what to do.
The optional initiative cards look very promising to add more thrill, detail, bluff and last but not least "storytelling" by introducing events. I'm looking forward to give the game a new try with them.
- Update: The optional cards are a major improvement and give the game more decision points for the players. Nevertheless, the combat system is IMHO to fiddly and time consuming. Two tables and four ratings (range, ship size, firepower, die roll) have to be consulted and three of them are subject to modifiers which have to be checked. Too much game system executing instead of decision making.

RATING: 6
After several plays I am a little disappointed in the game: Naval warfare is all about maneuvering and positioning, especially during the age of sails. Ideally, you have to stern rake your opponent's ships to win a battle. In this game, the ships are grouped by commands and commands are activated alternatively. While it's an ingenious system to avoid ship logs, it fails to properly simulate the maneuvering element:

I've played a scenario where I managed to place in raking position four of my ships, at a range of one hex, cutting the enemy line at several places. This should have been the "best case scenario"! Guess what? I failed all my rake die rolls but one! (I also rolled poorly for my gunfires, but that's not the point.) What happened next? My opponent had quite a good time: It was easy for him to rake my ships. He succeeded all his rake die rolls (and gunfires, too). Three of my ships were instantly damaged and my opponent won the scenario. Victory was not decided because of superior maneuvering and seamanship, but because of pure luck! (Good for my opponent, bad for me.)

The rake die roll has been put because of the alternate activation system and it was right to do so: It would be unfair allowing an automatic rake just because the opponent moved before you. But it adds an important luck element where there was none in reality.

I perfectly know that simultaneous movements and ship logs are considered "out of date", "difficult" and time-consuming. But I don't believe it is possible to properly simulate naval combat otherwise. Besides, playing Flying Colors is quite time-consuming as soon as gunfires start.

Further, the melee combat resolution seems rather "all or nothing" to me, but I still have to ponder this...


Conclusion:

The game gives a good global FEEL of the era, but is too luck dependent (initiative, rake and break-off die rolls) to really satisfy me. If you are lucky enough, the game is quite fun, otherwise it can become quite frustrating!

My current "go to" Fighting Sail game (and series). Puts you in the role of commodore or admiral, commanding squadrons or entire fleets of ships. The abstraction level makes Trafalgar and other large scenarios possible in a single (albeit long) sitting. Mechanically, the initiative and command systems, ability to fire during movement, and defensive fire rules are a nice change from plotting and increase decision points.

Components are top notch, with function and beautiful 1.5" counters for ships-of-the-line and .5" counters for commanders, smaller ships and admin. Unfortunately, there tends to be a lot of counter clutter on the map, so I recommend using the GMT log sheet (or even better some of the cards from the files section on BGG).

Recently played with a friend and although my traditionally sailing background and long history of playing WSIM and CA probably bias my opinion, this game didn't strike me as "easier" to play than either.  Although there's no logs to set up making setting up for play a little quicker - everything is a stack of counters which is annoying and takes a great deal away from the appearance and flavor of the game - it just doesn't have that feel you get from WSIM & CA.
It's a power boater's sailing game - anyone can drive a power boat - you have to KNOW how to sail.

The Best Age of Sail game I've played;it's better when you use the sheets to record your damages on,than a pile of chits on your ship counter(gives a bit fog of war effect when you wright it out).Would like to see a grand strategy companion game made for "Flying Colors"(1805 block game don't cut it),so that missions can be plotted for your ships---would be nice if they could do a thing, like they did for the GWAS series.

[1 play] This is interesting, and a fun experience to look back on, but I'm not sure I'm the target market for lengthy, deliberative, and procedural miniatures combat games. While I'd be happy to put it in the "once a year experience game" category, I don't think it has deeper appeal for me.

I can say for certain, that if not for the awesome tricked out set that Michael created for this game, I'd have close to zero interest in playing this very often with the small cardboard chits and map as published.

I'll stew on this for time, and maybe have more to say after that.

Would have liked slightly bigger counters and hexes; tough for my eyes to see the info on the ships; the BGG file here that lets you place status markers on a ship roster sheet gets rid of the map clutter once the damage starts accumulating. The counter size is really my only negative for FC.
  Components are usual GMT Games quality: nice, not great. Rule book is quite clean of errors (make sure to download current rules); and there are a lot of scenarios included, which is a big plus. There is also a brief section on creating your own scenarios, if you somehow tire of all the provided ones.
 FC is clearly geared for what it states: being able to play large fleet actions in a reasonable amount of time without a lot of detailed rules, while still providing interesting small engagements. Mr. Nagel has succeeded admirably, I think, in achieving his design goals.

However, after a couple of turns they saw how the subsystems work together to create a fun game.  By turn 4 they were wanting to set a date to play it again.

This is the happy medium between Close Action and Wooden Ships/Iron Men. Positives: large battles are now playable, interactive defensive fire mechanism that "spices up" the IGO-UGO gameturn, simplified command system, can be played with 1/2400 miniatures, two expansions in the works. Negatives: 3 huge maps that some people will not have the space to lay out, the various markers quickly clutter up the board, but you can use a log to record damage instead of counters. I also don't like the rule that does not allow ships to intentionally collide with each other, this was a historical tactic used several times.

EDIT-Game has only improved with additional expansions, ship on ship duels, initiative cards and the Suffren vs Hughes campaign game. Looking forward to a possible expansion covering the Swedes and Russians in the Baltic. The counter clutter issue can be resolved by using ship's log forms on paper. Rating bumped to a 8.

A light wind behind the sails, somewhat boring and bland.
I just don't care for the designer's games at all.

Excellent Age of Sail rules system which is marred by the designer fiddling with the rules for more "history" and unbalanced scenarios.

Play Cape Henry.  It showcases the system and is a balanced scenario.

I need more plays, but this one could become one of my favorites. Now I need to paint up about 20 mini's.  A bit more abstracted than Close Action which I also love.  Different type of game enough to warrant having both, now I just need to snag a copy of CA.

Seems rather bland.

My biggest concern, however, lies in balance issues.  The British may rightly get bonuses on hull attacks, and the French tend to aim for rigging then close, but this invariably leads to a slowed British vessel facing a half-sunk Frenchie...and guess who wins that contest?

To make the game more exciting, more attention and weight need to be given to maneuver.  As well, my group agreed that the Manpower rules are poor.

Enjoyable, but I want to play Serpent of the Seas and see how that goes comparatively. For how long it took I did not think it was worth the time investment. It would have been more enthusiastically received had it clocked in about an hour less.

May have been a fluke so I will readily try this again.

Highly enjoyable fleet scale wargame set in the Age of Sail. Some bits are a bit oversimplified for the sake of playability, but they are worthwhile sacrifices as the game plays out brilliantly despite the large number of ships available in some engagements. 

Definately getting the expansions.

Initial rating is based on just the one game, so I accept it may not be fair as it stands. It may improve with further playing.

Counter clutter was a big problem for me. A good point is that the game also has status pads for those preferring that option. The downside being that some may feel they've got a lot of wasted counters in the box.

I have my doubts about the command rules and the inability of a line to be considered in formation once it commences a turn. Effectively this means ships in line need to be in squadrons of 4-5 ships if they have a poor commander.

'Audacity' is used for more than just crew skill, so I've no problem with that term. The difference in the audacity of the two sides can make a big difference to the gunnery battle, as it improves one side and degrades the other. An interesting mechanic, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out in other battles.

One other plus, the game runs fairly quickly, which is what I was expecting.

Played for the first time a week or so ago. I like it, but have to find a way to keep all the status counters off the mapsheet- it just gets too cluttered, too quickly.

I have spent a lot of time over the rules, thinking they were technically complex (even though much less than those of Close Action). In fact, everything went quite fine after the first setup: movement rules are logical, fire combat is very easy, and the game flows easily. The player's aids are very useful and help to keep the rule book aside.
Cardboard tokens do not have the appeal of ship miniatures, but they do the job. Aesthetically, the game has nothing to offer but that is to be expected.
The scenarii are many. The more ships, the longer the turns, but that does not add anything to the complexity of the game. The downloadable managing sheets offered by GMT are very helpful to keep track of everything.
The solo experience is very satisfying, and I expect as much from multiplayer. The game unfolds quickly and can fill either a day or an evening without being too painful.

Nice depiction of fleet tactics and very capably handles large fleet actions. To echo Matt K's comments, the criticisms of this game seem to be based on expecting the game to be something it's not intended to be. This is a fun game which depicts larger actions with style. If you're looking for detail and ship-to-ship actions, this isn't the best choice out there. (I've submitted a link for the designer's notes which are good reading for understanding what the game is trying to accomplish.)

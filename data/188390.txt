In my experience, a ride rather than a game. Lots of chit-pulling and die-rolling with very few decisions to make in the scope of the full campaign game, and those decisions are generally either: (a) obvious - there's one clear best choice, or (b) obscure - there are so many random levers between choice and outcome that you may as well flip a coin. In general you are not given any information on which to base your decisions (e.g. recon that suggests that submarine attacks will be worse than normal, or that site X may be better defended than site Y). 

Example of the former: Should I force move my task force at the cost of making it low on fuel? Answer: yes, you will always do this if your move roll fails, why wouldn't you? The 'cost' is easily made up by refueling on the following turn, and there's no reason to save fuel, since it's not used for anything except force moving.

Example of the latter: On which month should I place my diplomats? Earlier gives more chances for success at the cost of greater security risk. There is probably an optimal choice but the effects are so remote from the causes it's virtually impossible to figure out without running a Monte Carlo simulation of the whole game. Once the optimal solution is known, it will be true for all time, there is no variation in setup that might make a particular choice better or worse. 

Sold.

Really awsome game, extremely well done and supported.
It can be a little 'messy' with books and player aids layed out (need a bit of room).
Would really like to see an game just like this but from the opposite side, Play as Japan attacking Pearl Harbour or the likes.

Well dony, brilliant game. I am so glad i got myself a copy.

Well done! Hard to believe I could enjoy myself this much with such a niche subject I would normally not have any interest in. Minor annoying misprints in the books. Too many counters combined with small, crammed attack maps(my biggest complaint), and NO INDEX... C'mon it's 2017. Doolittle was very easy/smooth to learn playing scenarios in order, one of the best rulebook + scenario book combos I've read. This game could have been a nightmare without this format of books. They made a complex game easy...Bravo! Just a few times got caught up having to search due to the lack of index.  If the maps were bigger and it had an index I'd give it a 8! Crazy... Who woulda thought?

I've only played the first scenario, which is so much lighter than what you get when playing through the first scenario of Dambuster. That's okay though, as I know Doolittle is slowly preparing its players to take on the much meatier scenarios 7-10. Scenarios 1-6 are fast-playing and add a little extra each time. I think the theme is great, and Jeremy White is a genius, genius, genius designer when it comes to storytelling. Even if the game is almost completely on rails for its initial scenarios, it's okay if you're a fan of the ECA series and know what to expect. I'm looking forward to the extra planning and complexity that it is to come in later scenarios. Surely my rating will go up by that point!

A solitaire game of the bombing runs done on Japan during WWII.  Numerous player aids with step-by-step how to play and the lengthy rule book is for more in depth and lookup.  I think it's first game that I didn't have to read the rules first, but could learn as I played scenario 1.  I liked that and wish others did this.  The big planning map/poster is really nice graphically, except it isn't mounted and the battle boards are postcard stock.  I think the battle boards should have been the same material as the tank info cards in panzer and the map should have been mounted.  It's really nice graphically.  The game tells a great story and I can't wait to see how the other scenarios will unfold.  Very nice game.

Very much like Dambuster and that,s a good thing. Components are superb and the player aids are the best in any game. After a few runs you Can almost do without the rulebook. Many decisions but still quite luckdriven. Even the full game (sc. 10) will only take 2-3 hours so even the grief after a less than succesfull flight is quickly forgotten when you start another campaign with another plan

I really really enjoyed this but more of a story/simulation versus a game per se.  You have some critical decisions along the way but there is lots of luck wrapped around this story.  But... this adds to it I feel for what the story is trying to tell. 

The designer has done an absolutely fabulous job of creating the story, the rules set, aids, etc.  The game looks daunting to learn at first but due to the designers rules presentation, aids, etc, I found it not to be.  Index would have been nice at times though but really not a show stopper based on the good work done with the rules.   There is lots of chit drawing, die rolling, etc., but this all adds to the atmosphere.  Just know this is what you will be getting into.

I imagine there is an optimum Planning Stage approach for a "best case" game but even with the die rolls involved that could vary.  Once you know the best case, I think the Planning Stage would lose its appeal.  But it could be fun to play around with different Planning to see how results would turn out over Japan.

Recommended!!

A follow-on to "The Dambuster Raid", which did not interest me. But I can't resist the Doolittle Raid and all the drama associated with it.  August 2017

An incredibly interesting and richly themed game.  Choices early on can have a dramatic impact on outcomes later.  Wonderful achievement.

Beautiful components but must say this game screams "Mounted Map" as it already is creasing poorly.  You'll need some table space to lay it all out as there are charts, tables required for reference.  Love the different options available which increases replay-ability.  The designer packed this game with theme and history.  Even reading the rules and materials is fun. Wonderful effort.

Just into the Attack Scenarios so far, and yeah not a lot of decisions (those will come in later stages) but the scenarios play smooth, they are tense, and are incredibly thematic.

Sure there is some unusual complexity here, but it's easily managed with the excellent rule book and player aids (alas, no Index). Soon you'll be in the pilot's seat of a B-25, feeling the throttle of engines as you fly (and bomb your way) into history.

The designer has done an *outstanding" job putting this game together, going beyond the proverbial labor-of-love.  Amazing game, truly!

Have only gone through Attack, Flight and Denouement segments so far but not sure I want to play the full game after this. There isn't much of a game, you just pull from cup, roll and things happen, lots and lots of cup pulling/rolling. To me the whole game ended up being pull from cup, roll, pull from cup, roll, etc After a while it just became highly unfun and pointless. At the beginning I could get into the theme but after a while you are just pulling/rolling. I had the game on the table for days because each time I tried I just would get bored and give up.

If you are into this raid the simulation is probably for you. If you want a fun game where you have to make decisions I would steer clear of this one. It feels like this is something that a computer should simulate if you want to see different outcomes, it just didn't work for me in a tabletop form.

Cool - I can bomb my house! Ordered 1/2018.

Edit: I found two misspellings of Japanese cities within 60 seconds of opening the box.

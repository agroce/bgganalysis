GAME: Kuhhandel Master
RANK: 2005
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've stumbled upon this game, and I'm delighted to have such a great lightweight game (just above a filler, in my book) entering my collection. First, a few notes: I don't own the actual version, but the Print'n'Play Samurai version (Kamon) that is available here on BoardGameGeek. Second, we play with the two-card draw variant by default, which can speed the game up a good deal. 

Why is this game great? The interlocking mechanisms all work together to produce a simply fantastic bluffing game. First, you have auctions, which are bluffing in their own sense, but then the auctioneer gets to choose whether to pay the winning bidder (and take the cards) or receive payment from him (and give the cards) -- this adds an extra layer of subtlety over the whole ordeal, and sometimes we found ourselves bidding extra high for cards the auctioneer really wanted -- because we knew that he would be paying us for them!

Secondly, you have the trading, and this is where the game kicks into high gear. You can make closed offers to other players, with face-down money cards (that may even all be 0s). The player you are trading with can respond with a counter-offer, or just take your money and give you the card you want. But beware -- if his counter-offer is higher than your offer, you stand to lose the very card you wanted from your tableau, and it goes to him instead!

This is compounded by four payouts throughout the game (on the 50, or Uesegi clan) which progressively pump 5s, 10s, 20s, and eventually 50s into the money market. With such high bills floating around, auctions can get ludicrously high, and trades can often be very tense because you don't know if your opponent is pushing 4 zeroes towards you, or 4 twenties. Will you take it? [i]Should[/i] you take it?

Kamon/Kuhhandel Master is a shining example of a "German game" which is exactly what we need more of these days. The rules are simple, though take a little bit to grasp, and the depth of gameplay is all dependent on the players around the table and their interactions. That, to me, is the mark of a great game, and I highly recommend Kuhhandel Master. Or, if you have the time/skill, consider crafting the Samurai deck, which really puts the game a further cut above in my mind.

Kamon subverts everything that you'd except from an auction/bluffing game, and packs it all into a tight 45min-1hr runtime. Playing 3-6, Kamon is one of the best light games out there.

This game is an excellent auction game.  We have played this with as a family twice now and both times we had a blast.  There is yelling, screaming and laughing.  If you like auction games you must get this.  There is a lot of bang for the buck here.

Variant op de klassieke koehandel, waarbij ook prijsbeesten en ratten extra ingevoerd worden.  De ratten vernietigen een ander kwartet.  De prijsbeesten moet je kopen door zo veel mogelijk kaarten te bieden (niet zozeer het meeste geld).
Beide elementen zijn plezant, maar maken het spel langdradiger.

Tip: Neem 2 kwartetten uit het spel en het zal rapper gedaan zijn zonder de leuke elementen te verliezen.

Funny auction game, with 2 stages, a public auctions stage in which everyone tries to buy cards in competition with the other players, and a secret auctions stage in which one competes with a single player trying to win cards by offering more money secretly. The goal is to complete as many set collections as possible, each having value as high as possible.

Just as much fun as the basic Kuhhandel, and can be played with one more player. The rats and permium cards are nice additions.

Unexpectedly, there are some difficult decisions to make in this game, particularly in relation to the rats.   One element that I don't like is that if someone spends a lot of money one round, they are doomed the next round, giving whoever is lucky enough to be the start player a big advantage.  Otherwise, a fun game.

- Gameplay and replayability: 0/3. The gameplay is no fun at all. We were constantly counting: 10-20-30-40-50-60-70-80-90-100-110-sold! After doing so for an hour, everybody got bored to death, so we decided to put an end to our suffering and quit playing.

- Luck factor: 2/3. The luck factor definitely influences the game, but I think it is leveled off because there are so much cards being pulled and because you can always decide to spend a little extra money to still get the card you need.

- Player range: 1/3. The game has a wide player range, but I guess it is only worth playing with 4 or more.

- Duration: 0/3. I think there are too much cards to be auctioned, making the game last some 2 hours. This is much to long considering the highly repetitive gameplay.

- Learning curve: 2/3. Not too hard to learn, but not trivial either. I guess it can be explained in 10 minutes.

- Theme and looks: 1/3. The cards look OK, but I wouldn't consider them beautiful. The theme is plausible but still shallow.

- Set up/clean up time: 3/3. Can be set up and cleaned up in less than 5 minutes.

- Documentation: 2/3. Good enough, but you need to write your own reference sheet.

- Durability: 3/3. The cards won't wear out easily.

- Portability: 3/3. Perfectly suited as a travel game. 

- Summary: Kuhhandel Master is very repetitive and downright boring. I wouldn't dare to ask my friends to play this game.

Better graphics than You're Bluffing, and the addition of more cards probably balances the scores of the game, but the addition of the extra card types makes a card game that already dragged a bit too long, and made the game even longer.

I like this game, but the slightly shorter timeframe of the original makes it just as fun for me.

Yes, it is simply a glorious game. The improvement over the old version is small. The rats are a fun idea (sort of Kuhhandel meets Geschenkt), but I am not sure yet whether I like the necessary strategy changes that come with it. And the graphics can't hold a candle to the older versions. It was nice to try this out once, but I guess I will go back to the original next time.

Um jogo ao estilo de "Modern Art", mas com um design infantil. No entanto, considero este Kuhhandel ainda melhor. Quando ponho alguém novo a jogar, ao verem as cartas torcem um pouco o nariz. Após jogarem, ainda não vi ninguém que deixasse de elogiar o quanto gostaram deste jogo. É um jogo de leilões com imensa interatividade. É uma frenética guerra de cartas, de perícia negocial. Este é daqueles que recomendo sem qualquer reserva.

RATING: 7
I'm not entirely sure what they were trying to accomplish in releasing a new version of You're Bluffing.  In general I like the additions - the pedigree cards give you added incentive to go after a particular animal.  The rats seem good in theory, but can unbalance the game a little bit.  Because they are so debilitating to a player's score, they have to go all out to avoid them in the horse trades, thus potentially creating a big imbalance in money at the end.

The other problem I realize that I have with both versions of this game is the incredible variability in what you auction off.  If you flip a rat on your turn there is really no advantage - you will still be forced to pony up at least one card, and you do not get to auction off a really valuable card.  Then the guy after you flips a horse and makes a killing.

All of my problems would disappear if there was a viable way to shorten the game.  It takes some discipline to keep the game moving and you really have to do that or it just drags on too long.

Wer an der Reihe ist deckt eine Karte vom Stapel auf, auf die alle anderen Spieler wild bieten. Am Bietende hat man selbst die Wahl das Geld einzustreichen oder die Karte vom Höchstbietenden zu kaufen. Später im Spiel hat man eine 2. Aktionsmöglichkeit. Sobald 2 Spieler die gleiche Karte vor sich liegen hat, kann man einen Kuhhandel vorschlagen. Man gibt diesem Spieler verdeckt Geld und der kann es nehmen oder ein Gegenangebot machen. derjenige der am meissten Zahlt, bekommt eine der Karten, dabei behalten beide die Geldkarten die sie verdeckt getauscht hatten.
Wenn jemand ein Quartett eines Tieres hat, kann dieses nicht mehr angegriffen werden. Sobald der Stapel leer und keine getrennten Quartette mehr existieren endet das Spiel.
Ich finde das Spiel ganz gut, aber ich hab es überhaupt nicht raus. Was mich tierisch (HAHA, Wortwirz) gestört hat, war die ewig lange Spieldauer (1,5h). Ich hatte dann auch nur noch 500er Scheine und 200er auf der Hand... Wer überbezahlt bekommt kein Wechselgeld!
Alles in allem habe ich nicht gut abgeschnitten und ich werde mein Spiel wohl wieder verkaufen.
Die Aktion "Kuhhandel" macht Spaß, das Kartenversteigern (mir) nicht und die Spieldauer ist eher was für größere Spiele und nicht für das kleine Kartenspiel.

Similar to the original Kuhhandel game but with a few additions. If you like one, you'll like the other, but I doubt that having both doubles your fun.

Hmmm. Is it better than the original? I love the money variant idea and the multiplier, but the cards are too big and thin and the graphic guy was not able to add the money value in all corners. So the answer is: Not really, because I can play with all this ideas with my old set. The rats might work with 6 players but not with 3 or 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An intriguing game where bluffing is a very essential part of the game. Without it your chances to win become really small. Auctioning is what makes up at least half of the game and which is simply interesting. The other half is obviously, like the game suggests, "Kuhhandel" or trading "cows". In this game "Kuhhandel" not only stands for trading cows but any kind of animal. But here instead of really selling or trading fairly, it's more of a gamble since you try to guess which amount of money your opponent has laid out on the table. Will you accept it? Or will you try to put an even bigger amount on the table without knowing how much he/she had put? Like I said, without bluffing this game won't nearly be as fun.

RATING: 9
I played it now with the new cards and rules: as unbelievable fun as normal "You're bluffing". Ultimate screwage factor and still strategic. And now even spiced up with the "no thanks" bidding mechanic for the rat cards and a counting down auction for the pedigree cards that counter balances this and gives the game even more tense in-between-moments. 

Amazing auction bluffing game: NOT A FILLER! The game can take 90 minutes to play. This is not too long: a player has to be involved all the time and even more important my friends and I have great fun the whole game through.

You can also play normal "You're bluffing", with this game by just removing all the rat and pedigree cards which is a big plus.

I slightly prefer the original, so I rate it one point higher.  The pedigree cards add a nice touch but not a huge difference.  The rat cards are an interesting idea, but I can take them or leave them.  As a whole, they're ok additions, but not strong enough to offset the added playtime to a game that can take a while to finish. Still an excellent game no matter which version you play.

RATING: 8.2
This is a simple bluffing and bidding game. Every player gets the same amount of "money". Then the deck is shuffled and every card revealed one by one. If it is an animal (except the rat), the one that bids the most can have it, but the revealer (so the active player) always has the chance to buy the animal for the bidder's price. (pre-emption right) 
The rats get auctioned differently (not sure how, can't remember :) ). And there are also the "gold-donkeys", when those are revealed, everyone gets more money.
After the deck is depleted, the players start to "challenge" other players for animals. E.g. if you have 2 horses and another player too, you can challenge him for both horses. (if that player only had one, you could only challenge him for one (both always bid for the same amount)). Both players put money on the table face-down, and here comes the bluffing part in (you also have 0-bills). The players exchange their bidded money after revealing and the one that bid more gets the animals. With the rats is converse, the player that bid less gets it.
After all have acquired their sets, the points get evaluated. Every animal has its value, the number of sets matters, the rats annule one set I think...
At the end, the player with the most points is the winner, tiebreaker is the money that the players have left.
I really think this is a very cool game, simple but very good.

Theme/Art:
Funny theme with pictures of stones looking animals.

Production quality:
The cards are of good quality, the rules are easy to understand.

Replayability:
It's a really fun game, fast to teach, and a good filler and family game, so quite high replay value.

Depth/Difficulty:
It's very easy to learn (especially if you play the basic Kuhhandel, which is without the rats and premium cards). However, it is not that easy to master.

Strategy:
You need to keep track of the money of your opponents and try to get your foot into the door of as many animal groups as possible. Since you cannot change money, you have to look out for how much you bid. It happened to me that I bid 120 and only had a 200 bill.

Luck:
There's only one random factor in the game: The order of the animals up for auction. But since you can buy an animal even though you auctioned it, it's not so bad if you have to auction something you need for yourself.
The rest of the game is knowing your opponents and managing your finances.

I see quite a lot of complaints about the length of the game, which is a bit surprising to me. When I played it with four players it took about 45 minutes per round. Sure, it's not the shortest card game, but it is very fun.

All in all a fun filler card game with a surprising amount of strategy involved.

This is a great party / filler game. Auctions, bluffing, a lot of payer interaction, fun and some tactics, all in 1 one tiny (inexpensive) box. What's not to like?

The variation of auctions makes it more tactical and makes the game less repetitive. Artwork is very nice too, although not always very clear which "master card" suits the normal card. 

Easy game to play, but you have to play it once or twice to really get all the mechanics. So, for the type of game it is, it's quite complex. But still learnt in about 15 minutes though. It's also what makes this game fun after loads of plays.

Recommended!

Original artwork was much better. Adds fun new mechanics but people always tend to prefer the original game.

Basically a vehicle to promote stupid animals to your friends in the most ridiculous way. Can be very fun but highly dependent on the group.

An improved german version of [thing=1117][/thing]. The game itself is language independent and you can find the english rules here on BBG.

Played this at Dragonflight 2004.  I like the relatively quick play.  Normal 18xx games seem to take forever, and by the time they are really interesting (e.g. brown tiles, etc) everyone is too tired to do a lot with the tiles and tokens.

This is an introductorey game to the 18xx game series. It is not an easy game to master, but quite easy to learn. It has not all the flavor that bigger 18xx as 1830, 1856 and 1870 has.

But it is good. You can play it several times without finding it boring.

Are you intersted to intruduce yourself and your friends to the 18xx games. Start with this or 18AL.

I really like the game.  It feels like a  real game about companies and business.  Eventhough we forgot some key rules (like the stock marker goes up in the stock chart if all stocks are bought out and the way trains work), I still had a good time.  I want to play it with all the rules correct and see how the game is different.

Comments after a 5-player session: The board of 18GA gives the impression that like this is an introductory 18XX game. However, this is deceptive. 18GA rewards the player who plans 2-3 moves ahead. Almost-perfect timing is needed to play this game well. Income is relatively low compared to the train prices, especially from the 4-trains upwards. Players who are presidents of PLCs must ensure that their PLCs have enough cash to upgrade their trains when the time comes, or pay through their noses for a compulsory train. There seems to be a lot of cash in the bank. Perhaps reducing the amount somewhat would make a better game. Beginners might want to try 18FL or 18SCAN first. Veterans might relish a cutthroat 5-player game of 18GA. I like this game, especially when played with veterans.

Its fine for a shorter learning game of 18xx, but I think there just isn't enough to play with to create the diversity I want in an 18xx game. I don't see how repeated playings are going to feel dramatically different, or enjoy different development.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like 18AL, this is intended to a be a shorter version of the 18XX system, and it can easily be crammed into the middle of a normal session as games of this should play between 2-4 hours depending on player competence and speed, whereas the bigger games are easily 2-3.5 hours longer than that. 18GA is based on 1830, the venerable grandfather of the stock holding branch of the 18XX family, and the side of the family tree that I seem to enjoy playing around with the most.

Vis a vis 18AL, 18GA's private companies seemed to have less sexy powers, but beyond that I didn't feel there was a big variation in the way they played. The 8's vs. the 4D's is significant in that it is more difficult to optimize the 8's though, and unlike the 4D's they will be undesirable purchases for many of the companies that can or will be forced to buy them. I think this might give GA a mild nod over AL for me, but I need to play them both more to be sure.

Overall though, I find 18GA to be an enjoyable experience roughly on par with 18AL and like AL slightly weaker than the other related but longer 18XX games that I've played to this point like 1830. I like how short this is, but the shortness can also be a detriment. The big upside to this, of course, is the ease of availability. Get the stuff printed out, make it up as nice as you (or your group) like(s) it, and enjoy. I like the ease of getting these shorter games onto the table, and they still have many of the interesting decisions and moments that I like in the bigger games. The downside is that the short length of the game makes the outcome often turn on one or two critical plays. If you make a big mistake in the stock market, you're probably done in this game because there just isn't enough time to recover. The short length of this game makes it a semi-regular on my table, but I've definitely reached the point where I favour the full length 18XX games whenever it is humanly possible to squeeze them into a session.

This was my introduction to the 18xx series and as such is a very worthy game!  But having played the lengthier, deeper versions I'd be much more interested in playing one of those over this introductory game.

[b]Comparison to 1830[/b]

The rule about 1 train purchase per OR at the beginning of the game irks me. I can see how it probably makes for an easier 18xx, but if the designer was going for a shorter more introductory game this seems counterproductive. This rule seems like it lengthens the game and fails to introduce players to one of the more important early game considerations.

I want there to be fewer 2 trains. The shelves on the stock market are a little too close together/numerous. Other than that it mostly seems like a good short game.

[i]We played 18AL without the 1 tr. purchase rule, and it didn't seem to hurt it.[/i] ditto ga.

This was my introduction into the 18xx games system and still my favorite.  I like its more generic approach (as opposed to more "historicised" games).  To be fair, however, I've only had the chance to play 3 different 18xx games.  

Update: I've now played around 10 18XXs.  I haven't played GA in awhile, but I'd love to.  I still think that I like this one the best.

Update 8/2/15: I played this again recently.  It is a nice, quick intro to the series, but I miss the chrome of other entries.

We played with 4 players, and it just felt like two of us had no chance to get a second company, which makes for pretty limited options.  Perhaps this is just a problem of not knowing the game well enough, because this issue doesn't bother me in 1830.  Needs more plays.

Played again with 3 players, and we were each able to run two companies.  It's a decent short 18xx game, but I can't say it grabbed me.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

RATING: 7
The first 18xx that I ever played.  At GenCon in '97 or '98 I stumbled into a playtest version of this game with who I now assume is the desinger.   I had zero clue what I was doing, and I'm quite sure that the other three players were experts.

When it was over, I knew that I had just found something amazing.  Since this version wasn't yet available, I picked up a copy of 1830, which was still going for retail price.  It remained unplayed for several years.  Now the 18xx series are some of my favorites.

I was very disappointed in the 4-player experience.  With only six companies in the game, I failed to float a second company when I could have - and then found myself on the wrong end of the priority deal next turn and without anything to do.  It's not that I took myself out of the game with one stupid move - that's 18XX for you, and the harshness is something I appreciate about the system.  It's that I wasn't able to do anything interesting for the rest of the game that bothers me.  In contrast when I played 1830 I probably also took myself out of contention early, but at least got to play around with the CanPac for a while as consolation.

Update 3/2010:  Had a very good play with 3 where all players experienced high and low points.  I think 3 is the way to go here.

It was my first play of any 18XX game and I liked it a lot.  It didn't hurt that I managed to win, though that was not really by clever play, just avoided pitfalls and did well with my best company.  It was compact enough that we had explanation and full game (3 players) inside an evening - maybe 3 hours total.  A compact version, it still had many of the aspects of larger games and was good to get a taste of the series without a lot of time and/or brainpower sacrificed.

Fairly easy 18xx game with minors that are not as interesting as some of the other games.  Main wrinkle here is Atlanta, which is affected by the Civil War's devastation.  Problem is that you still need to get there and to the off-board locations to if you want to win.  I like all 18xx games, but this is my least favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There's a lot to think about even in this '18xx for beginners' game. Certainly a lot of potential and I can see why people really like their 18xx. Quite keen to give it another go, though I'd like to play with poker chips rather than paper money next time. The amount of cash that changes hands means that money is handled much more frequently in this than in any other game I've played and using paper just gets wearing after a while.

Through playing this game, I have learned that I'd make a poor businessman. I knew this before, but now I realise just how hopeless I am.

Well, well, well.  The introductory 18xx series decides to get a little more evil.  Now we've got private companies that impede progress?  Nice.

The knives are out a little better here.  The map is still a little too... open?  This is a good thing for beginners like me, but it seems that this game has a couple of optimal moves.  Good for teaching, though, and plays fast: Even newer players can get through this game in under 3.

2017 UPDATE: Everything holds true.  Another great entry point to the world of stock-and-train games.

Atlanta makes my head hurt.

Very simple 18xx (marginally simpler than 18AL) Not recommended for 5 players - there's only 6 companies. Took us 4 hrs 4 player, with players who already knew the rules, and with a $7000 bank instead of $8000. The 8 Trains didn't come out, so the 4s survived until the end of the game.

I love this game! It is better than 18AL.  I like the way the privates block their home hexes, the evenly spaced par values from $55 to $110. I like the fact that it has two boards (the original, and the Cotton Port Variant).  And I like the fact that the board is unbalanced, with Atlanta dominating the northwest, but more cities in the southeast.  I like the fact that the top trains are 8 trains: they are much harder to secure a good run for than the 4Ds of 18AL.  8s are risky, and the long runs can be buttoned by a corp that saves some late-game cash.

I designed nicer looking boards for this.  I see no need to play the longer-winded 18XX titles.

RATING: 9
Several 3-player games. Played very much like 1830 but faster due to the smaller size and lesser money in the bank. The private companies are mostly of limited value (C0G being the exception), the free 2-train was not the good deal it initially appeared to be and the CoG share looks to be worth a lot more than the $190 it went for. Runs a bit long and maybe should have a smaller bank. Floating the 1st company at a high Par can pay off big benefits with train purchases. Privates Co. that control tiles are not useful initially as they only come into play after purchased by a Corp., but by then track may well have been laid around them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An excellent 18xx game of developing train routes.

This game is certainly better than 1830, and also plays in half the time.

In our 3-player game, the risk of bankruptcy (a major factor in 1830) was almost missing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A shorter version of 1830. Like 18AL geared for 3 players. 
Liked the small cities being a bonus rather than a hindrance, encouraging builds using them.
For theme - like how Atlanta starts strong as a yellow, then gets weak as a green (thanks to W T Sherman) then becomes the powerhouse of the map.

RATING: N/A
Holds a place in my heart since this was the first 18xx I ever won, but the game itself is not that interesting. It's a 6-company game, so at 3p everyone gets two companies and at 4p two players do, and one of them will probably win. Also, the game seems to be about avoiding needing to buy the 8Ts, which are flat-out evil.

RATING: 8.5
Certainly, it is a fine little 18XX game.    This and its companion piece 18AL are well worth the effort to print up and cobble together.  In a perfect world these would be nicely published packaged together on a double sided board.  

I suspect that the bank is a little bloated, I'd be interested in trimming a grand off the top and starting with 7,000 (or perhaps even 6,000). This bank cut should bring building right to the end of the game rather than over optimizing the spaghetti and repeating runs.

As opposed to 18AL not all companies are created equal.  Knowing this going into the game helps a little, but it can be startling when you first jump into a company expecting something more.  You should go with the suggested variant of moving the G&F (GirlFriend) starting city up to Columbus is evens out the board a bit.  

Still though it gives a very satisfying 18XX experience, and with quick players could be completed in an evening.  With contemplative players this 18AL and Steam over Holland are the only 18XX games that are going to be close to finished in a very long evening.

I didn't like this as much as 18AL, but I've only played both once.  The map seems really open, but that is probably because I had four of my 8 tokens left at the end of the game and there were only 5 empty token spots.  Without the cities you can't token there would be no big late game runs.  Also the privates seemed less interesting.  I had fun playing though. 2009/12/01

Ok as a 3-player teaching game, though I think you're better off just learning and playing 1830 itself (especially if you have four players).

Fundamentally, I don't think the 1830 branch of 18xx (loot your first company to set up your second one) lends itself well to small games.  Players are virtually forced into a certain pattern of development and the lack of company variety means that play becomes extremely stereotyped.

Further, these games don't support more than 3 players in practice, since each player really needs two companies to be competitive.

Between 18AL, 18GA, or 18Mex, go for 18Mex.

18GA was my first exposure to the wacky world of 18xx.  I quite enjoyed it, despite being abused by M. Webb :shake:   The longer more involved games like the 18xx games have really become a source of major interest for me.  I am fascinated with them due to how involved they are, how every decision effects the game.  I look forward to additional plays in order to really get a feel for how to make *good* decisions :)  There are not many games that I spend hours thinking about after playing.  Trying to determine which decisions I made could have been done differently.  This is one of those games.

I was going to rate this until the learning PBEM game I'm participating in is completed, but the posting has slowed down tremendously and it could be a while before that happens, so I'm just going to make my comments now.  As my first foray in the 18xx series, I have to agree that 18GA is indeed a good introductory game to start with.  The rules are well written and streamlined (although mastering them is another matter entirely); the gameplay is very easy to get into.  Plenty of difficult decisions to make right off the bat: what private companies (if any) to bid for and how much; which corporation to start investing in and who to help if you can't afford to operate your own?  This game is choke full of player interactions, buying and selling, opportunities as well as foiled plans.  Playing this online made it possible for me to project my future earnings and to consider several moves ahead, and I imagine in a face to face game it becomes much more intense.

My only concern is that the opening operating rounds for each game seem to play out exactly the same.  W&A always connect Atlanta to Rome and then either Chattanooga or Montgomery (with the former more likely); while ACL stretches across Brunswick and Waycross towards Tallahassee.  The others have a couple more choices but invariably the tile laying is very similar between each sessions.  Only until tracks start to connect and intersect does the game become much different.

I like 18GA and can't wait to try the others, but the feeling I've gotten from my first play is that with the complete absence of any random elements, the experience seem very limited from the start and choices seem obligatory rather than voluntary.

One of the shorter 18xx games.  Only takes about 2-3 hours to play, so is a good one to use to introduce new players to the genre.

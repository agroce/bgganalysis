A great game, I had the 1s edition but I couldn't see much beyond the quality of the components which was abysmal for the amount of money it cost, this one is a gem and ticks all my boxes for quality components

Fantastic solitaire game with high replay value. I hope I can get my hands on an expansion soon. 
There are so many different heroes to try out and see how the game unfolds.

I love zombie games and like the idea of solitaire games more than I actually like playing solitaire games. When I am in the mood this is a good one to scratch the itch.

After traded my second edition away, reacquired the first edition. I liked the gameplay in second edition but few things kept me away from the game. This first edition reassured me that I really like this game if presented properly. This is one of the game where "less is more" applies.

This game is a gem.  Easy to understand and play once you've run through the steps a few times, it doesn't get old.  Each play creates a unique story and each play is challenging, as a good solitaire game should be.  There are lots of decisions to make, just not a lot of opportunities to make them!

An interesting solitaire Zombie theme siege game.

If GMT is going to publish the deluxe version (mounted map, better cards and counters, etc.), I will happily buy it again.

I was about to order this game today (9th July 2012)
When i saw that a new edition of Dawn of the Zeds is coming out.. Now I'll just waiting for it.. Awesome! 

Update: Still need to buy this one, but i like the old map better than the 2nd edition, but 2nd ed has better components.. hmmmm

Bigger SoS game. On par with Malta Besieged and then some as far as complexity and decision-making goes. Lot of game packed in there. Possibly picking up third edition at some point.

RATING: 8
A cool little zombie apocalypse game.  Although the component quality is incredibly cheap (poorly cut counters, no staples in the manual, and tiny dice the size of pencil heads), it still makes for a fun game.  It uses a combat results table for hand-to-hand and gunfire combat.  It gives you a cluster of actions to choose from that are interesting.  And it has Pickles the dog (who got his brain eaten in the mine on my first try at the game).  I think this one will be a hoot to play from time-to-time!

This is a very good game. Don't let my 6 rating throw you off. But it is a solitaire game. If they offer a replacement card set with their new production capability, I would probably up my rating. The current cards make it a PITA to play the game because they are so non slick.

First edition:

Nice game with lots of choices and, of course, a great theme. For the most part, I like the design decisions and how they incorporate the staples of zombie fiction. There are even interesting additions, like refugee movement. It creates a palpable sense of desperation the first time a zombie horde moves within striking distance of the town and you throw your only available unit in front of it and pray for a good roll. It's easy to picture your ragtag band of citizens, their eyes widening with terror, brandishing their bats and knives and makeshift weapons as the zombies come down the street, knowing that if the horde gets through, the town is finished.

The end-game condition is very clever. When you draw the National Guard card, the game might end, and the likelihood is increased if you've done a good job of eliminating zombies and removing chaos markers.

A very good game that stands up to repeated plays.

Second edition:

More of everything: new characters, new track, new zombies, new rules, new challenges. An improvement in nearly every way.

The map is interesting and will require some getting used to. A couple additions (Catacombs in particular) are candidates for some personal house rules. But overall an exciting new experience that is worth the wait.

**Full disclosure: I was a playtester for the 2nd edition**

Based on first, error-prone playthrough. Will probably go up once I get a better handle on it. Great thematic game

*edit, June 27, 2012* Great game but it's a little too fiddly for me. Difficult as well. Mage Knight scratches the same itch, and better.

*edit Jan 2013* I liked this game a lot but ultimately I couldn't overcome the difficulty, the fiddliness, and the subpar components. However, owning and loving D-Day Dice, I now see what a difference components can make in a solo game and will definitely give this a second look when the Gold version is released

*edit March 2013* Gave this game one last play to see if the Gold version is worth it. Printed out a couple of awesome player aids and the game was much less fiddly. HOWEVER, while thematic and fun, I feel it is extremely difficult and possibly too luck-based, especially for the time the game is taking me to play. I am considering Zulus on the Ramparts for it's simpler setup, components, and shorter playtime. I also like that you play cards in that game, as opposed to this one where it's event driven.

End of the day, you want a difficult, somewhat lucky, but highly thematic game, you can't go wrong. Even my first edition version didn't annoy me! With the second edition available, no question it's a good game to own

This is my first real solitaire game since Barbarian Prince from the days of my youth.  I dabbled with Labyrinth's solo play once or twice, but found it too fiddly.  Dawn of the Zeds really hits a sweet spot as far as providing a meaty gaming experience with a minimum of rules overhead, and provides a good thematic story arc each game.  It's tough to win unless almost everything falls your way, though.

 DotZ is a worthy entry to the SoS series.  Excellent solitaire game.

RATING: 5
Let me say that I'm a zombie fanatic -- I love zombie games.  I love grim games, and I love solitaire games.

I don't love this game, though, at least not so far.

The biggest problems I have with it is that DotZ gives you an EXTREMELY low chance of winning (not a problem by itself), and the game takes wayyyyyyyy too long for that (which is a problem).  I'd say you have maybe a 10% chance of winning, and with setup and takedown, the game probably can go for four or five hours.  And worse, you can pretty much tell how the game is going to turn out about two hours in.  So if you want to finish a game, it just feels like you're going through the motions.  That's not a good thing.

Picked up a pre-"official" production release at the CSW Expo (has a few nits now being fixed in time for the official release). First session had consuming gameplay, strong narrative. 

And I keep getting torn apart by the Zeds - extremely challenging game (just brutal - the sense of hopelessness is right there).

Takes longer to play than the other SoS games.

I don't own the 2nd edition, and have no intention of purchasing the 3rd edition either (VPG is just money grabbing once again with 3 editions in just 4 years, c'mon).

Solo card driven zombie chits seige. Research the cure, hold off the zed onslaught tracks converging on the town with limited and depleting supplies. Villagers become refugees, protect them, get them to help fight. Super Zeds. Evil Doctor. Close contact with the zeds drives up the outbreak threat. Simple combat system reference odds table. Three difficulty modes. I seem to prefer Zulus on the Ramparts.

Still my favorite of the Zeds series. Not quite so complicated though it's still complicated at times.

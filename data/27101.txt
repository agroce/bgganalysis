Disclaimer: I was part of the playtest team.

Bomber Command is really two games in one covering two scenarios to illustrate the night bombing offensive in 1943-1944 and 1944-1945. The two games in one element is that there is raid plotting, movement, detection intercept game and the actual bombing process which is a mini game in itself. The heart of the game is the "smoke and mirrors" element that the RAF player must use to cast a veil over his plan, the Luftwaffe player must penetrate this veil, detect the raids and vector his night fighter gruppen to intercept what he hopes is the main force raid (raids in the late war scenario). Running alongside the main force are various Mosquito, decoy and Gardening (minelaying) raids which all go to "fuzz" the Luftwaffe air picture and disperse the night fighter effort.

Once the target has been reached and bombs dropped the bombing sub-game is played through with the RAF player determining the accuracy of his marking and initial bomb drop and then each player moving bombs to increase or decrease the number of fires started.

Throughout all parts of the game both players can play cards to affect detection, combat, bombing accuracy, etc, etc and this element adds greatly to the flavour of the game.

As a last word, the amount of research effort that has gone into making the game as historically accurate as possible is astonishing as was the effort to produce an error free game. Enjoy.:)

Bought on bravenewworld.biz. I'm not advertising or anything, but a few hours after I pressed "Pay" on PP, Lee Brimmicombe-Wood posted this in reply to one of my posts:
"Indeed, you admit this destruction is true. Of course, you couch it as a vision of your boot on the throats of 'terminal conservatives' (am I a terminal conservative?). But maybe we terminal conservatives don't matter in this Brave New World of yours."
I see this as meaning one of two things: either everything is connected; or Lee personally tracks every single one of his boxes and he uses that information to let you know he knows where you live when he gets angry with you.

With an interest in Bomber Command for many years this quick and simple game feels exactly right.  'Quick and simple' may turn you off, but the detail is there and you can write up a raid history in the same way as the historians have done for the real thing.  Played solo (not yet tried the solo variation rules) this is still a tense game.  

The bombing sub-game is excellent.  When you have  to deliberately target residential areas to get creepback onto industrial zones there no pretence you are just hitting the industry, not the people. And at the end of a game you can think "Lost 17 bombers, times 7 crew per bomber, potentially over 100 more RAF dead from this raid alone". So the actual impact on both sides is brought home. 
  
The only irritation is the random way the bombing disruption markers are made up - turning over one marked 7 to find 27 on the other side, not 8, I find irritating. But this is being very, very picky. A great game and well worth the money.

A surprisingly simple and streamlined treatment of the Allied night attacks over Germany in WW2.  In many ways this is The Burning Blue after the rules have been edited out.  I'm not sure that I prefer this to TBB, but the shorter playing time is definitely nice.

Played at a convention, loved it and bought it. Good solo too. Great system for getting to the target. Cards work well. My only criticism is the somewhat tedious and gratuitous city damage procedure. I suppose it does bring home the horror of a firebombed city. But it really feels unnecessary.

Played once; pleasantly surprised. Much more engaging than The Burning Blue was, with some real ongoing decisions and definite opportunity for bluffing and guessing. Still more complicated than it needs to be, but once you get going it plays smoothly. After The Burning Blue and seeing the 24+ page rulebook, I was feeling a bit gun-shy on playing this one, but it ended up grabbing me and I was pleased.
---
Despite usually being well-executed, Lee's games are a bit hit and miss for me. I like Nightfighter, I think Downtown is good for what it is, while The Burning Blue did very little for me despite a huge topical draw. Anyway, I'm on board for Bomber Command, as it looks a bit more playable and the situation somewhat more amenable to gaming. But I hope living rules are published soon, before the P500 orders get charged ...

Dad was a tailgunner in an Avro Lancaster, 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron. Here's an article I wrote about his 30 combat missions:

http://members.optusnet.com.au/dacoutts/Thirty_missions_John_Coutts.htm

"Overall figures for RAF Bomber Command are 66,851 day missions (and 876 losses) and 297,633 night missions (and 7,449 losses). That's roughly 22.5 % day missions over the course of the war, though the bulk of the day missions are from 1944 onwards."

I'll look forward to seeing some RAF Bomber Command day missions then!

Excellent game of cat and mouse. As the British, you need to pre-plot your various bombers and on what turn they will leave. As the German, you need to figure out where the British will go and, through jamming, discover where they are at specific times. Lots of tension, even though the game is not very interactive. At least, unlike Duel in the Dark that looks at the same conflict, the card play keeps both players involved as the British can play cards to make the German's life harder.
Lots of bluffing and double-thinking going on. Not too complex (certainly not as complex as Mr Brimmicombe-Wood's first two efforts).
Recommended.

RATING: 6
Unusual game that just about works and has interesting subject material. The british player plots hidden routes for his bombers and then goes passive for the next 30 mins to an hour whilst the German searches the skies using radio control and ground spotters to improve his plains chance of an intercept. It has the feel of a solo game ingrained in its systems and draws heavily on a rather uninteresting card deck to keep both players engaged. Whilst I might sound down beat on this game I do think it is a feat of design from Brommicombe-Wood. Its a tough story to replicate in paper and the game does a good job of ratcheting up the tension and giving both players a tough puzzle to solve. The real let down is the interface, there is a lot of counter shuffling and track checking. On the plus side it is mercifully short for a game of this sophistication, I would expect players with the rules down to turn out a game in under two hours.

RATING: 9
Captures not only the technicalities but also the flavour of the night bombing raids. It's another winning air game from Lee Brimmicombe-Wood. Lots of opportunities for bluffing like The Burning Blue but the card play in Bomber Command really adds more interaction and strategy to the game. But more than just the flying part of the game, the bombing mechanism also adds a strategic element to the game, in that the British could still lose the game even if the Germans failed to shoot down a lot of bombers. Speaking of that, I've got to go practice my bombing...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While not for everyone, it is a very tense and exciting game to play when the Main Force Raid gets into Germany, reaches and bombs its target, and works its egress.  Between the cat and mouse aspects where the German isn't sure of where the British bomber force is or where it's going, there are the marvelous cards that modify various game activities and is a game unto itself!  Highly recommended for those interested in the subject; for others, I'd say play someone else's game first and see if it's for you.  The drawbacks are well covered by other comments, so I won't repeat them.  

For the British player, major game decisions come down to planning the raid and executing the bomb patterns over the city.  At other times, one can feel like the game is mostly "driving the bus" on a scheduled route.  

For the German player, on top of the problems of raid detection, discrimination, and forecasting, there's this little problem of what/who to scramble, when to scramble, and where to vector the fighters for intercept--and how.  Doe I do Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) in the Himmelbett?  Do I aim for Wild Boar attacks over the likely cities to be bombed, just ahead of the bombers?  Or do I try to infiltrate the bomber stream with twin-engine night-fighters, picking off bombers one-by-one each turn?  And when do I need to break off and Return To Base (RTB) before I run out of gas...should I divert to a non-home airbase so I can squeeze some more time aloft instead?  

Love this experience this game provides.  Definitely moments of quiet desperation and nail-biting tension!

RATING: 10
Environmental variables have more inpact on success or failure than actual user input. End game is a bit boring and anticlimactic. In short: it's realistic.
As a game it might be a bit lacking to some (though the card play adds a bit in this regard), but it's probably the best simulation of RAF night bomber raids conceivable (in cardboard).
I love it even solitaire.

owned for a bit, but the theme is covered in Nightfighter and Duel in the Dark, and you really only need so many operational air combat games and I already have Burning Blue, Downtown, and Elusive Victory.

Interesting system. I enjoyed my play very much. Only two downsides - British player has to plan his flight in advance and then does not have that many options how to influence his results. And two on German side there is too much micromanagement with fuel for nighfighters.

I like Burning Blue and Wing Leader more and thus giving only 7

RATING: 7.5
(Rating based on three plays)

My impressions are positive. Bomber Command nicely captures the feeling of night raids over Germany, but it is very procedural and feels more like narrative generator than a game. Keen interest in strategic bomber offensive is a must to enjoy this one.

Rulebook is well written, although there's a lot to read and learn before playing the first game. Once the game begins rules turn out to be much easier than they seemed at first. Rulebook doesn't have an index - a huge minus for this one! Some other minuses:
 - it's fiddly, especially when almost all Luftwaffe is in the air to stop the British. Keeping track of many different scoring markers is also a bit inconvenient.
 - for the German player everything depends on the detection roll. If the roll fails the German player can do almost nothing for that turn. I believe this is historically accurate but it can spoil the fun.
 - somehow I felt that bombing the target city mini-game doesn't add much (except for the VPs for the British).

One more thing: the game is one-sided and feels a bit more like a one-player game with a Game Master, than a true two player game. Not a problem for me, because playing as the British is fun. Just something to be aware of.

Rant: components could have better quality. I can live with thinner box and rulebook printed on thinner paper, but paper maps really suck and cards are thinner than the deluxe ones known from Twilight Struggle and Labirynth. Other than that, the dice are top notch and player aids are very nice as well. Unfortunately there is only one copy of each aid.

Rant update: I got the mounted map. I no longer have a feeling that components should be better.

Many people say it's more of a simulation than a game. I'd say it is a narrative game for 1 Player (German) and 1 Game Master (British). And it is very good at this. The British can prepare the game beforehand and later enjoy the effects.

The theme and historical accuracy is very high, lot of chrome. In addition, the bombing minigame is just lovely -it is a great reward for British player who remains pasive most of the time. 

Certainly not for everyone, but worth giving a try. I highy recommend playing first game as Germans against experienced British player.

This is the first (and to date, only) game by Lee B-W that I've played.  It made me want to get every other game he's done, even though air combat is not my primary interest.

Very, very deep game, that has a lot of book keeping for the German player with regards to tracking fuel for each squadron. There's a LOT to this game, which, once you learn it, gives you a fantastic experience. Just know that the time investment to learn this, and learn it correctly, is hefty. The bombing sequence at the end is one of my favorite war game experiences (and I was the Germans getting bombed!). Seriously detailed, this is a Brimmicombe-Wood classic. The secret movement planning just makes this game a real gem.

Disclaimer : I was a playtester too!

An excellent game of cat and mouse in the night skies over Germany.  

Whilst the RAF players main work is complete once he has plotted his raids the card play during the game keeps him actively involved as the main focus shifts to the LW player to try and determine the riads target and mobilise his defenders to maximum effect.

I just wish I could play this some more!

I got this as a present off my Amazon Wishlist, but it proved disappointing. The British Player has to plan out their raid beforehand, so that runs on railtracks and cannot be changed. The Germans get a bit more flexability with their nightfighters and there are a few random cards, but my first mission ran through both card decks, so they are not so random as you might think, it's just a case of when they show, not if. I sold it on at a good price and bought Twilight Struggle.

A 2-player game on the subject of the RAF night bombing raids in Germany during WW2.  

Upside: Rules are fairly well-written; I felt two readings were ample to get playing without too much stumbling.  Optional/advanced rules are well-integrated to allow the player to add more complexity if/when desired.  A night's raiding action can realistically be completed in a 2-3 hour session once the basics are grasped.

Downside: Immersion factor for the British player suffers after raid planning is completed.  The card-play and bombing-mini-game aspects do not fully compensate for this shortcoming.  The card-play aspect in particular seems shoehorned into the flow of the game, as if to give the British player *something* to do once the mission begins.

After a handful of plays, BC leaves me feeling a bit so-so at the end of a session.  There seems a bit more enjoyment and immersion to be had as the German player vis-a-vis the British player.  It's a game I am agreeable to play if/when asked, but not desperate to bust it out again at the first opportunity.

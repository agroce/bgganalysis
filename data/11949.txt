If you have never played a game that uses the [thing=91][/thing] system, you should start with this one.  The mechanics are extremely close to PoG, but the game is not as overwhelming.  You aren't looking at a giant board with a million decisions.  Your objectives are more straight-forward.  You know what you have to do, and you have to use your cards to get there in an efficient manner.

Also, the game is smaller in scope -- instead of a continent, it is a fraction of one, making it easier to wrap your arms (and brain) around.  As far as the game play, it is excellent, just like any PoG-themed game, but this might be the best of them for the reasons I said.

Shifting Sands is a simple clone of Paths of Glory, but without the nail-biting decisions.
I would have preferred more spaces in North Africa in order to have more operational feel, see also the map for Pursuit of Glory. 
Too much space on the map is only for placing cards! Lokking at the map you don't feel the epic of a WWII campaign in the desert.
Anyway Shifting Sand shows the campaign in East Africa, always neglected in other similar games.
Counters are good but not great, I still prefer what GMT has created for PoG.

Very tense game that mirrored the situation in Africa in WWII.  In the one session we played, my CW was able to march across the Libya front until Rommel showed up and push me back all the areas just west of El Alamein in late 1941.  You have to balance playing the event and using them as Ops.  See-saw action as the initiative shifts back and forth.  One have to be real aware of the historical events to minimize their effect (Balkan campaign is a real CW force drain unless you want to give up VP).  In our session, VP was pushed all the way to 13 for the Axis, but it was heading into 1942 with arrival of Monty imminent.  Need to play this some more.

The first time I played this game I absolutely loved it.  The system is similar to, but slightly simpler than, the system in Paths of Glory.  The components are great for this type of game.  The amount of errata is normal.  The events are more interesting than the events in most card-driven wargames.  After several plays, I've come to the conclusion that there is not much decision-making in the game.  Cards should almost always be played for the event.  The order in which certain cards appear is terribly important- the difference between an early or late Barbarossa could be the game.  Edit:  I'm rethinking my conclusion and am pulling down my rating (6) until I've had another go at the game.

Paths of Glory in North Africa, with simpler rules. Can't go wrong with that. 

It is one hell of a wargame. There is not a single moment in the game in which you won't be faced with incredibly difficult decisions. And the breakthroughs you sometimes achieve in your offensives can really break your opponent's spine. You gotta watch out your supply lines very carefully in this game.

If you liked Paths of Glory, but felt a little disappointed with Barbarossa to Berlin, you need to try Shifting Sands. It is the mechanics of Paths of Glory properly adapted to the more mobile and dynamic WWII reality. Also, it has much less chrome and exceptions than both Paths and Pursuit of Glory. 

One of the best wargames in my collection. And pretty well balanced between the Axis and the Allies.

Magnífico CDG aunque por desgracia difícil de conseguir a un precio razonable.
Mucho más flexible de lo que imaginaba, tenso, divertido y muy apretado lleves el bando que lleves.
Muy importante la gestión de la mano de cartas, más que en ninguno de los CDGs que he probado.
En su contra, el reglamento es un poco caos para buscar algunos detallitos de reglas que son de necesaria consulta pq son varios escenarios a jugar dentro de la misma partida (Abisinia, Persia, el norte de África y al final Túnez).
En cq. caso es un juego más o menos sencillo de reglas pero tremendamente inmersivo, aunque es verdad que escasean los grandes movimientos envolventes tan característicos de la guerra del desierto.

RATING: 8
(Based on 4 plays)

A very solid adaptation of the basic Paths of Glory system to WWII's North African theater. There are quite a few games on this subject so I'll explain why I think this one stands out:

1. Playability: the card-driven system brings its usual playability and reduced downtime to this conflict;

2. Scope: Columbia's Rommel in the Desert is also a fine game but it doesn't include the Iraqi or East African fronts, which this one does (and quite well too);

3. Learning curve: One of the things I like most about this game is that the designer took Paths of Glory/Barbarossa to Berlin and added exactly what needed to be added to make it work for this scale and theater.  He didn't add a bunch of unnecessary stuff.

Bottom line: this is a must-own title if you're a WWII or North Africa fan and are not hostile to the card-driven wargame model.

I like it a lot. Great map, cards and theme. And the gameplay is nice. One thing I love in these CDG's is the CRT tables which are just the right combination of luck and ratio.

Comparing SS to the Rommel in the desert is absurd since these are two very different games on the same topic. SS works on much bigger scale though. At the moment I like SS's treatise of the sweet african years much more. RitD being more gamey, dicey and abstract. SS is historically very interesting and of course deeply thematic. My only problem is the rulebook or the rules - or maybe it's my brains and memory but there's a bit for me to comprehend. I'm sure it will settle down.

CDG game with point to point movement. Looks very good!Purchased mint copy Oct 08.

First play thru Oct 2010. Rating based on initial play, but so far the way the game is unfolding suggests it will be a tense and down to the wire game. As usual it's not just about the desert, other theatres have to be considered for resources and activity, reflecting the constraints that the overall commanders operated under.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very preliminary rating, after one mostly completed play with the allies. 

An interesting and very flavourful CDG of the North Africa campaign, in the mold of Paths of Glory, but seems to me to have some potential issues. First, many of the events in the cards are very important, but some are part of complex chains. Meaning the luck of the draw plays a big part, get them in the wrong order and you can be in a tight spot. Secondly, due to the wild swings of the real campaign, the game feels a bit scripted: the axis has its window to try to win, and if they don't then they'll just be playing not to lose. One big plus in light of these is that it plays fairly fast (4 hours seems about right).

I want to play further to see whether these are serious issues or just a case of not knowing the game well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like Shifting Sands and have been avoiding other CDGs in this class due to the length of play.  SS plays in a reasonable amount of time and there is enough going on to keep things interesting.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of Cards, this one is probably still a solid 8.

Michael Rinella imports Ted Raicer's WW1 game-system from Paths of Glory into West Africa in WW2.

Does it work...well yes, but with reservations.  Unlike PoG where decisions about which way to use a card engenders sweaty palms; here, it's get those "removed from the game" events played at all costs.  Takes a lot of the agonising away.

There are also some "never play as event" cards, and the timing of when the "Spitfires" and "Torch" events appear can easily swing the game.

A pity, it had some nice ideas.

The playing time of this game is just too long. Played for 5 hours on our first attempt and got just half way through. Some of this can be attributed to little to no review of the rules before we began so we needed to stop and reference the rules on almost every turn. I like a game that plays in under three hours which I realize excludes the majority of deep war games. I preferred Twilight Struggle and Crussader Rex.

Another card driven wargame, but this has well understood defects from past games. In SS events are important as and sometime more than activations or replacements points. This gives many more card play options.
The only real downside in this game is that choices are limited from a strategic point of view. On the long run the game will be interesting at operational level, but risk to be repetetive.

Update: So I came back to this game after awhile and I was not nearly as enthralled.  The foremost problem here is the fiddliness.  There are piles of exceptions in the rulebook and then you have to keep track of certain cards and it gets pretty overwhelming even after close to 10 plays.  Even more unfortunate is that a lot of this stuff could easily have been on the map.  I prefer wargames with straightforward rules where the depth naturally arises than grafting it on with a lot of explicit systems.

More importantly the game itself is kind of predictable.  The first two turns are the Axis going to Khartoum and the Allies stomping them everywhere.  I hate the first two turns as Axis as the Italians are just pitiful.  You better hope you draw Balboa to get rid of the -1 drm or you are not doing anything useful on the first turn.  In fact the cards will screw you a lot.  Malta is completely handled by cards and is almost entirely won by the luckiest player.  You have to prune every removable event to increases your odds of Malta cards, but that means your card choices are pretty much set.  Sadly, the balance is such that the Axis pretty much have to win Malta to stand a chance.  Even if they do win, Torch gives the Allies another shot at winning.

The designer could have removed the first Italian only year and everything after Torch and had a much better game.  Torch is a mess having to set up and then move all those new units.  It's just another chance for the Allies to stomp on the Axis some more, as if the game wasn't already permeated with that.

Finally, the the tactical play is pretty underwhelming.  It is nearly impossible to cut supply off a decent opponent because the counter density in the beginning is fairly low and elimination is only checked at the end of a turn.  As such you are limited to mostly banging your head against one another.

Anyway, on the trade/sell pile.

--

Multiple theaters are really cool and there is a nice back and forth that many wargames don't achieve.  Unfortunately, there are a number of fiddly rules in a poorly designed rulebook that either get forgotten or I get yelled at by my opponent for remembering.  The card management is actually very well done, it's a nice balance between the possibility of a random hosing and a staid game with no variability.

One thing that is kind of tedious is Torch.  It's like a whole separate game that suddenly gets added on and the number of units involved starts to get a little unwieldy.  I definitely enjoy pre-Torch more.

After 3 plays and only one correct :D

The game seems to be very balanced and every detail matters.

The events are too powerful to be played as OPs, so the game is not so "open" as Paths of Glory. I really enjoy the liberty that Paths give you and you cannot have here, but its still a great game.

Rating based on one play as the Axis.  If I had never played Paths of Glory or Barbarossa to Berlin there's a chance I may have enjoyed this, but there's just no comparison!  This is SOOOO scripted that it felt like the game played me.  Both my opponent and I played the Malta cards as soon as we got them, and it was a close race but he beat me out (since my last Malta card was second-to-last in my draw pile).  After that there were times when I had a hand full of cards and nothing to do with them (since all my forces were guarding bottlenecks).  I understand the historical forces at work behind the decisions, but it just wasn't fun!

I selected this game as one to focus on since I was tired of having so many unplayed shelf sitters in addition to not really knowing a game since "Terrible Swift Sword". So, I will try to get a number of playings completed in relative quick succession.

After the first game, I must say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. I am too new to CDGs to pick up on nuanced comparisons, but I did like how it unfolded. Having three distinct theatres was fun and helped me to compartmentalize the game. The step loss combat was intriguing and the importance of reserves paramount. One aspect that I think is common to CDGs is the idea that you cannot do everything that you want to do, so a balanced strategy is essential, especially for the Allies who are on a timetable. The Torch Event is shocking at first, but not a game breaker for me as the Allies in West Africa are somewhat limited in their actions initially (due to logistical concerns). This is the first CDG that I have played that does not use a common deck that the players share. I also like how initiative (stealing, maintaining or halting) is a fundamental aspect of the game as you want to force your opponent to spend valuable cards reacting to your actions (dancing to your tune). That is one of the main attractions I have for this game and others like it.

Need to play it more, but so far I am really liking the experience. 

It plays very well via PBEM since there is no Defender reaction movement. The combat also works well. My initial FtF game went 7 hours and ended after Turn 10 (of 12). I am hoping that with experience this game will play in 6 hours if not less (that is, a two-evening game else one longer weekend play with a break for lunch). Toss the rules from the box and download the Living Rules as there have been a number of important clarifications and changes.

UPDATE:
Another playing and I enjoyed taking in more of the nuances of the game. There is a balancing to the timing of events between the four theatres that I really like which I feel speaks well of the overall game design. 

On the other hand, I am starting to think that CDGs where each side has their own deck are not my favourite mechanic. Not that I dislike them; rather I think that they place more emphasis on deck management which makes things feel a little gamey to me. Just a little...

I've kicked my rating up to a 9 after 3 plays, and the game has continued to hold my interest. It plays quickly, offers real and interesting choices, doesn't railroard you excessively, and has nice historical flavor. Of all the PoG-type games, Shifting Sands may function the best: the trade-offs between theatres make sense, where having to choose between activating British or Russians (for example) in PoG and B2B is nonsensical, even if it makes for a good game. The playing time in PoG and B2B was just very long, while SS is playing in a very sensible time. And I think SS has really found a good spot with the event cards: powerful and useful combat cards make combat more than just an attritional excercise in die-rolling, events are powerful and distinct enough to be flavorful, but nothing seems too out-of-balance. The large hand sizes (7-10 cards) seems to work very nicely with the mix of events in the game.

I wish the playing time were a touch less, but 5-6 hours is OK, and I can see it coming down a bit in future.

For the moment, the game is denied the coveted 10 rating for two reasons: firstly, it's still a bit fiddly. There are enough special cases to be awkward, and there is a lot of information that would have been immensely helpful to have on the map (supply sources, more helpful reference info like the extra BR RP for that East Africa space) and charts (like the -1 for being Italian, no Axis CC on sub-boards). If the special cases could have been more cleanly summarized in helpful places, it would have helped a lot (in fairness, PoG has this problem too). Secondly, this whole CDG thing is inherently awkward for modern conflicts. I mean, why is the timing of Torch such a wild crap shoot? Presumably when Torch was going to be launched was really just not that variable, and not such a complete unknown to the commanders involved. And manpower available as replacements really was just not impacted much by the pace of operations - the use of RPs in all these games is a useful game device, but this was total war and the game mechanism doesn't model anything.

Now, many of the cards in Shifting Sands make sense, this is not a general complaint, and it makes the game interesting in any event. But, there is some "thematic awkwardness" (as I'd say about a euro), and I wish things worked just a little bit better. But the game is still great and easily earns a 9 rating.

---
First play-through was very promising. Like all these recent CDGs, the rating is subject to some downside risk ... but I really like how Shifting Sands has stayed true to the underlying Paths of Glory engine and, if anything, reduced the complexity. Usually designers of fundamentally derivitive games can't resist adding a bunch of chrome - see Triumph of Chaos for an extreme example. Michael Rinella has done a great job in adapting existing systems in both Shifting Sands and Monty's Gamble: Market Garden.

The cards seem in a nice zone (consistant, powerful enough to be exciting, not so powerful as to be unbalancing). The game seems to play out in historically plausible ways, and is tactically and strategically interesting.

The bugbear for all these CDGs though is replayability, so we'll see how it goes on that count.

RATING: N/A
Uses the Paths of Glory / Barbarossa to Berlin engine as originally crafted by Ted Raicer. It has a bit of refinement as compared to those two earlier games: the main point being that there is less fiddliness throughout (fewer "rules" seemingly tacked on for solely historical reasons that need to be remembered during play).

RATING: 6
[16/10/2006]A fascinating game. Have to gain more experience to see whether it deserves in my books a yet higher rating or not. 

Presently I have slight concerns that the game's somewhat more static than the historical campaign and that the Allied conquests of '42-'43 are hard to achieve and that the Torch front is so much cheaper to activate compared to the desert front that the latter will see less action in that time frame than would be called for from a historical perspective.

[6/11/2007] I've decided that the issues I indicated in my earlier post (and a few others, I dare say, e.g. replayability) are quite serious problems. My understanding is that the designer and the game's CSW following are debating possible solutions. 

Until I see some considerable improvement regarding these issues, I'm afraid I cannot in good conscience rate the game higher than a 6. Not a bad rating on my scale, but not a good one either.

Really disliked this game.  Very static, felt very much like a WWI system applied to North Africa, exactly the wrong feel.  Randomness in reinforcements meant critical forces were often absent from the board when historically they were there, preventing anything close to the historical action.  Quickly sold.

Rating lowered from 3 to 1 once I realized Rinella gave a 10 to his own design.

I found this game suffered from, what for me, are the worst aspects of card driven games.  Play felt constrained, almost scripted, and most events were no brainers to play.  The side theater of Ethopia was home to the most action, while the DAK and Brits camped on the Egyptian border for the whole game unable to advance against each other.  The DAK then moved west in anticipation of Torch but wasn't allowed into Tunisia by the rules until Torch had happened.

It all felt very artificial, and I never quite warmed to the whole LCU / SCU thing.  This game and it's parent the legendary PoG are not for me, and I suspect none of their offspring are.

I'm a big fan of the CDG genre. I like the separate decks and the graduated decks (like PoG) which Shifting Sands shares. I also really enjoy the North Africa theme here. 

In Shifting Sands the luck of the card draw can have a pretty big impact on the way things evolve. The events can be very strong. I like that, and it forces the players to be flexible in what they want to do. I also like how the cards get higher in OPS as the decks progress, as well as the hand size increasing. It lends itself to more CC play, which also can increase the bloodiness of the battles.

The game increases in tension. The Axis can get close to an auto-victory, but its really hard to get over the top and get that last couple VPs. The Allies have time pressure to clean up East Africa and then the NE map. Rommel shifts make the Panzer attacks brutal in the mid-game. There are some Allied events that really cripple Axis supply, which works well historically. The whole thing is just tense, fun and feels like it fits the history well enough. 

With repeat playings, I'm finding that this game lacks the magic of Paths of Glory, or even possibly Barbarossa to Berlin. One of the beautiful things in those games is the horrible agony of choosing how to play a card. Here, there are so many cards that give you OPS points to spend or markers to place, or the event is just so strong....that its a no-brainer to play the event. There is less decision-making. I still find the game fun to play, and there is still SOME of that tension, but nowhere near the constant near-panic feeling that PoG can induce. 

The other thing that I find is that the luck of the draw seems to have a disproportionate impact on who wins the game. There is simply more luck than in some other CDGs I've played. For esample, whether Malta falls one way or the other hinges largely on how early Barbarossa is drawn. At this point, I still find myself wanting to play more times....but I suspect the overall replayability will suffer for me, because it will start to feel like the outcome of the game has less to do with my decisions and more to do with who gets the cards in a better order. Or maybe I could play Twilight Struggle and come back to this one, and the luck will feel much less. 

Update: There seems to be a big imbalance in the mid-war decks (1941) between the 2 sides, in that the Allies have many more cards that are "removable". The Axis are doomed to have several more 2 OPS cards "stuck" in the deck upon adding the 1942 cards. That by itself wouldn't be so terrible, but the Malta Convoy limitations are crushing. The end result is two-fold. Firstly, the difference in when Barbarossa appears seems to have a huge impact on the way the game plays out...and even who wins. Secondly, the Allies have many "square" events which can be played for both OPS and culled from the deck. There are surprisingly few dilemmas as to whether to play these or not. In the overwhelming majority of cases, you just play the events as soon as you get them. In the end, it just feels like there aren't as many interesting decisions in how to play the cards. Deciding which cards to hold and when is the biggest place decision-making comes into play. But after more experience I'm not finding a lot of meaningful angst or sacrifice in how the cards are played. The more I play this one, the more frustrated I get that the luck of the draw is really the source of variability in the game outcome....and not creative play by the players.

A clone to POG and BtB, My friend Nando thought me the rules in ten minutes.
After six games completed this game seems to suffer from the same problems of BtB: fixed card play and overpowered armored formations; and some of his own: poor replay value except for tactical executions, and ridiculous combat value for american and italian units. 
Play is smooth and fun, you don't have to learn a gazzilion of rules, but if were not for the subject this game would have already ended on a shelf. 
Very good prodution value. Very good if you are looking for a not complex GAME for an evening of fun.

PS: the combat and step value of italian units (those fighting in late 1941, 1942 and 1943) are ridiculous at best, the overpowered american formations roaming the map of Shifting Sands are equally disturbing. I know that this is design for effect but it's nonetheless a shame in a otherwise smooth game.

Great game that gets better with every play.

Tense game full of historical flavor.  

Some complain the game is scripted but having that card in your hand that must be played just adds more tension in my opinion. Trying to keep your opponent occupied so that he needs to use his "must play" card for OPs rather than for event is also fun.

Mike Rinella does it again.

1 and 1/2 game plays.  I like this game, but it has some issues that seem to bog it down.  I may change my opinion after multiple plays.  However, as a game (not simulation) Shifting Sands feels, at times, that it gives up good gameplay for the sake of historicity.  The game suffers at times to be historically accurate.  This does not make it a bad game at all, but at times you feel if the game is "playing" you and not vise-versa as it should be.

I am also amazed that the entire CDG system is lifted from Ted Racier's design, and still with the living rules now published, no public thanks to Ted Racier for his system.  This is a blatant lift of it.  However, MR has done a tremendous amount of his own work here in regards to play balance and research, but the backbone of the game is not his in any shape or form.

In the end, I think I will like this game.  I don't think it will be a classic for me, but it will be a good game that I will willingly play.  As our second game continues, I will update these comments.

Rommel once likened desert warfare to naval combat; ie fluid. This ain't it.
Too many changes to the cards that's it's impossible to remember which have changed and which haven't.

RATING: 8
Reading the rule book, there seems to be a very strong similarity between this and Paths of Glory. What particularly impresses me is the way, with very few changes to the rules, this game has such a different feel to other games using the same basic system.

Great CDG that pulls out a fun theater and gives it a place of its own. This doesn't quite have the maximum gaming capacity as, like, Twilight Struggle or Wilderness War, but for a war game it fits the need nicely.

Outstanding.  Puts the North Africa campaign in full context - instead of having to remove troops here and there for secondary campaigns, you can choose whether to send them or keep them (at a cost).  Unlike most North Africa games, I found myself doing almost EXACTLY what Graziani did historically in 1940...  Overall, this is almost certainly the best game on the topic.  It's a heck of a lot of fun, reproduces the history well, and can be played from start to finish in just a few hours.

I was not impressed by this wargame.

Too much depends on getting the right cards at the right moment (Malta) and the situation is too sticky.

RATING: 8
Good, straightforward North African campaign that borrows the best of [i]Paths of Glory[/i], with appropriate modifications for WWII. Like [i]Paths of Glory[/i], it is more game than simulation, but it's a fun game that can be really tense and come down to the wire. If you prefer gritty realism, then I suggest moving on to [i]Dak II[/i] or [i]Desert Fox Deluxe[/i] instead.

While I'm happy with the game overall, the rules are a bit more fiddly than I like with all of its special rules regarding supply points and so on, and you should definitely use the living rules. As with [i]Festung Europa[/i] the timing and arrival of a handful of cards can be crucial, and there's a few you really need to watch out for, e.g. Egyptian Uprising, or it could be a short game. The playing time is, unfortunately, just long enough that it's too long for a single session, but is quite manageable in two shorter sessions. Plan on 8-10 hours or so for the full game.

Anyway, thumbs up.

RATING: 9
A good adaption of the Barbarossa to Berlin system to a smaller scale. I actually enjoy this more than BtB, mainly because both players have good the attack/defend options through the game. Its also quite colourful and exciting wrangling over sideshows like East Africa.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After 5 years I had much anticipated this, but was much let down.

Shifting Sands misses the forest for the trees. Too much of the game is focused on re-enactment and not nearly enough editing/builing down was done.

It has all the game-y things that BtB suffered from: two chit sizes for different scale units, a convoluted event chain that favors memorization. Divisions die if you don't stuff the replacement box full of battle groups... which simultes what exactly?

On the positive side, I very much like the thought put into the card decks. Thematic elements of the war pop up at vaguely the proper time. But it's not a guarantee nce a few cards at the bottom of every stack are likely to be shuffled in without being drawn!

All in all a welcome addition to the growing canon of Card-Driven Wargames.

This game gets a lot of things right. Nice card balance, decent playing time of 6 hours (which means it can be finished in one sitting), interesting decisions to make at every turn and models quite nicely the ebb and flow of the North African campaign. Compared to Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, rules are a touch non-intuitive (flanking attacks, for example) but that's a minor point.

All comparisons to Paths of Glory should be first tested as the scope of the game is not nearly as grandiose.  This is a much more focused and almost scripted game.  Still there is plenty to try and experiment.  Plus this game can and will be played in a good 4-5 hours.  I think the Axis have their work cut out for them but there is enough action and drama for both players.  The Allies just seem to be raking in the ressources whereas the Axis have to beg, steal and borrough to get anything done.  Just like the real thing.

Update:  One WWII Desert game on my desert island and it's Rommel in the Desert.  It's so cool it ruins Afrika and Shifting Sands.

I'm still thinking about this one.  I'm rating it an 8 right now.  I love card driven wargames but the cards seem much stronger that the events in Paths of Glory.  At some point it can become frustrating when you opponent keeps throwing down powerful events that crash your party (Malta Convoy cards for instance).  I'll update as I play it more, these are just first impressions.  And of course I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Update:  I've printed off the updated rules and I'm really liking this game.  It a gem with great CDG gameplay and a cropped playtime.  All this means I can play it more often and get to know the cards- which is the upside of a CDG.  OK... played some more and for me and my wargame buddy this is a five hour game.  I wish I could get it done in three hours!

It also works well along side my love of Rommel in the Desert. Shifting Sands paints a broader picture of the whole theater, which has been educational for me.  Rommel in the Desert gives me the hooks and slashes of mobile desert warfare.

This game uses the POG rule system and I wish more wargames shared systems, it makes the time investment of learning a rule set payoff- you just have to check the details to look for changes!

An interesting extension of the Raicer PoG system to the deserts of WWII North Africa.  I think this is one of the most fluid and compact NA games and it does a great job of capturing the wild swings of the campaign.  The events are a bit scripted.

The victory conditions are finely tuned. Point gained, lost, or not played early in the game make a difference at the end. The first year and both sides have offensive striking power, which is an unusual in many WWII operational games.   The core rules are very similar to PoG and WWI:BtB which is nice.  There are many location specific rules to keep track of but summaries can be found here on the BGG.   Definitely can be a nail biter for both sides and very fun.  I rank 8 while PoG and BtB a little higher mostly because those have more sweeping Grand scale.  SS is a great game.

jeu intéressant, plutot rapide à jouer, et avec pas mal de rebondissement. une bonne adaptation du système de path of glory.
par contre il y a trop d'enchainement de cartes nécessaires, et les options stratégiques sont tout de même limitées sans compter qu'on sent qu'on est "programmé" pour suivre la trame historique. C'est intéressant, rigolo mais ça en réduit la rejouabilité.

I had a billion comments about this game (pretty much a review) but I'm cutting it.  Suffice to say, I started high on it and ended up pretty meh.  An oppressively card gamey CDG with a million strict card prereqs, and with few enough turns where you will not see the cards often and many MUST be played.  I'll leave my final comment:

I haven't played this game in a while so my rating of it is slipping.  The primary complaint I have about the game is the way that Torch basically resets the game.  I feel that the Allies can play like absolute shit the entire game and then once the Torch card hits the table it is like they have another great chance to win that they don't deserve.  I don't feel that the endgame in Torch is really balanced properly yet.  Ultimately there are so many amazing CDGs that this one slips down my priorities quite a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only played once.  Allied Victory by taking Tripoli.  Need to play again.  It was enjoyable although at times may feel scripted by what events you receive.  The cards that can be played for event/ops are usually done so, although I did feel at times that I was nuts not to. Also, no deck management like in twilight struggle as there are "too many" cards.  I didn't even get Torch until the second last turn, when it seemed no longer useful to play (and went for the auto victory instead, which sort of made the battle in E. Africa and Near East "futile").

RATING: 7
Faster than his "father-in-law" Paths of Glory and a bit easier. Enjoyable, with nice mechanics to recreate the desert war, even if a perfect simulation -a difficult task indeed- is not achieved.

A superb CDG on North Africa, the Middle East, and Ethiopia in WWII.  Even though these were different theaters for the Axis (involving very different troops), for the Allies the used all the same soldiers to deal with the different areas of conflict.  

Masterfully balanced and really makes the players feel the stresses of the different combatants.  The Allies having too many theaters to deal with and needing to really "win" by driving the Axis off the map, while the Axis feel the crunch of inferior troops (everybody but the Germans), not enough RPs, and being seriously outnumbered.  Great stuff!

Excellent game.  Fast play with a great deal of tension.  History and gameplay are balanced exceptionally well.  Although the differences from PoG appear to be minor, the result plays like a very different game.

My group and I have played pretty much all of the current CDG's, and the only other ones that are close are Wilderness War and Hannibal.

One of the reasons for this is that Shifting Sands strikes an excellent balance between playability, theme, and simulation.  Some of the other CDG's are better at one of the three, but I think this one is in the sweet spot.

Great CDG which works reasonably well as an overall simulation of the North African campaign.

Card interactions are much more important than in similar games, so the players really need to know their decks in advance or total disaster can easily happen.

Its biggest flaw is the poor simulation of the operational challenges of both sides in the Lybia/Egypt border, although this problem can be minimized at a certain extent by playing with the optional rules for the hypothetical 2nd edition.

RATING: 5
After playing this game many times now, I have come to the conclusion that it is a very good competitive game experience, but bears little resemblance to the actual campaign.  The battle for Malta (which is crucial to the game) is relegated to card play, but Syria and Iraq warrant counters on the map?  I think the idea of including these "side shows" was misguided and they could have been better represented in the cards.  East Africa can take on much more importance to the Allies than it did historically and Khartoum is far more vulnerable to an early Italian attack than it should be.  It is almost impossible to replicate the see-saw "Benghazi Handicap" that occurred historically. I feel the game is more of a missed opportunity than anything else.  I really wanted to love this game, as it is now I like it.

Same system as PoG, but less complicated.  Well, I've played 6 games now against several players and I've played both sides.  At first I loved the game, but now I find it really does not have the North Africa Campaign feel I'm looking for.  In all of the games I played, there was little action in North Africa, and hardly any signficant back and forth campaigns as happened historically.  Cards are too frequently played for events, and the Axis player can easily keep the Allied player busy in Ethiopia and the Middle East until late in the game.  The game would have been much better if the action was much more focused on events in north Africa, with only ocassional activity in Ethiopia and the Middle east.

Great Point-to-Point Card-driven game.  Presents the real strategic problems of the theatre: no just the battle on the North African littoral, but the importance of the Near East and East Africa.  Events cover the political and off-board military events that had significant impact on the theatre (such as the Greek campaign and Barbarossa).  

Weight "Medium-Heavy", though "Medium" would be more appropriate on purely wargame terms.  A good design and fun to play.

The more I play it, the more I like it.  There's a bit of a learning curve here, as you need to know what cards are important in sequence, and how/when they should be played.  Some view this as a serious game problem (being forced into certain avenues of card play), but after some repetition, I don't think it's a big problem. You have to tailor your strategy to history, which is fine by me.  I need to play this more.

just in, played a session and it plays extremely well. The traditional hex and counter operation game element plays similar with the area movement mechanic that is you either move or fight. In addition, the card mechanic really adds a exciting dimension to the game in terms of tactical options and the play of events. The system is very much like Paths of Glory or Barbarossa to Berlin however, the cards have more functions. A very tense game that is very balanced.

I can see this game making other people very happy, but it didn't click with me.  I found the rules fiddly, with an excess of 'one off' exceptions and "gotcha" moments, and the play rather uninteresting.

much better than Barbarossa to Berlin. I like that both sides have different decks and that new cards are introduced per year. this way you have events in roughly historical order but player still has many options.

suffers the same problems that Barbarosa to Berlin, Paths of Glory, and Empire of The Sun suffer - the card driven games are a poor representation of modern warfare. You always end up with large formations sitting around as you dont have the command ops to move them. This is just not realistic...and it forces a played to concentrate all forces into one or two spaces - once again not realistic.

RATING: 8
Point-to-point (well, to be exact, squares) movement for North Africa campaign during WW2.  The prototype (map and cards) is very nice.  And the ptp movement system could be very suitable for a mobile back and forth, hammer to hammer between Monthy/ Patton and Rommel.  A worthy- looking-forward-to item.  The item is out in July 06. 

A lot of card events affecting the movement and combat.  It might be common to see the movements into special spaces (and there are quite some) hinging on certain events e.g. Herkules for Malta.  There is a whole section devoting to combat units outside Libya/ Egypt. But it might not be that common they also have effects on replacement points and reinforcements, even stacking limits (Patton and Montgomery).  Playing this game is sort of like going to an history class on the campaign, making the game prone to card-counting. Remembering all of them in order to play the game to the maximum may be a painful exercise. Fortunately, a lot of these special rules are written on the cards themselves - a strong point for CDG.

At last I have played the game yesterday after 5 years since its release! It is a very rich game and yet the basic game system is very digestible. I am amazed how the entire campaign can be done on a single map in such an elegant fashion - albeit some rules overheads are quite substantial with regards to the historical events and thus a lot of scripted card events affecting movement, combat, replacement, reinforcement etc. But I think you utilized CDG engine a la Paths of Glory to the fullest admirably.

However, my gaming partner and I had some problem with the supply rule in 13.54 The problem is that the rule seems to be talking of a situation where the supply rule doesn't apply anywhere. The rule 13.54 "Units may trace supply to a friendly-controlled port space and then overland to as Supply Source" should be talking about the supply via sea. No more than two ports may be involved in tracing a Supply Line - referring to the supply via sea as well. Hence, it is no redundant to the beginning which says "Units may trace supply to a friendly-controlled port space and then directly to a Supply Source. This refers to supply via normal land supply line.

My gaming partner disagreed. He thought that the rule as it is now written is redundant in itself. It is because a unit that can trace a supply line to a port and then overland would be in supply automatically as it can trace a supply line overland already. There is no port supply per se that neither side can enjoy on the map by tracing to a port first and then to another port.

A French player also pointed out the same problem similarly in 
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/11714264#11714264

My gaming partner and I were stuck by it for an hour. The problem is that the rule seems to be overwrought and redundant somehow with the concepts of supply source, tracing a supply path, port supply altogether. I am asking the designer to the questions as we are planning to play the game during the Easter holiday again. There is a game here definitely.

RATING: 7
Fast playing game with lot of action. Important to play along with the cards and make the best of them. You need to keep an eye on developments in the different theatres and have some knowledge of the cards to play well.
Important things to remember: 
1. spaces in limited supply only need 1 OP to activate for movement.
2. if all enemies are eliminated in battle you may move LIKE AFTER AN OVERRUN!. 
3. always garrison your key spaces with something. :-)

Michael Rinella seems to have the knack of adapting tried and trusted systems for new situations. 

In my view, (admitedly based only on one and a half plays of the campaign game) the original Paths of Glory/Barbarossa to Berlin sytem works better for this campaign than it did for the originals.

I liked the inclusion of the lesser known East Africa, etc. "sideshows".  I also liked the way that the Tunisia campagin gives the Axis one last chance to go on the offensive even if (as was the case in my game) the tide had turned on the main Libya/Egypt front.

I am, however, not 100% sure of replayability.  As others have noted, most cards seem best played for the events - some of which are very powerful indeed - and the game seems very sensitive to the order in which the key events come out.

One of the few games to show the scope of the British command sphere beyond the Western Desert. The Tunisian portion is a bit funky as there is no build up - the Torch card happens and all of the sudden the theatre is jammed with units from both sides which you must plan for as the Allies .
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Paths of Glory derivative, its good for all the reasons PoG is but feels slightly inferior in almost every way.

Theres a lot less angst about what to do with each card (most of the time theres an obvious best answer), the strategic scope is smaller and every game tends to play out almost exactly the same (allies take East Africa by the end of '41, Middle East by the end of '42 and everything except Tripoli and Benghazi by the end of '43), there can be a bit of variation with how you get there but the control of VP spaces in '43 will be almost exactly the same every time. This means the games tends to come down to points generated by cards (Malta) which has a lot of luck attached to it. 
The game is longer than most people are making it out to be (around 6 hours seems more realistic) and it can start to drag a bit when Torch gets played and you suddenly double the amount of counters - I probably would have preferred having the game end before Torch or having it heavily abstracted. 
Theres a lot of fiddly exceptions which arent well represented on the map or player aids (or are completely absent) and a number of possibilities for easy automatic victory against someone who hasnt played before and doesnt see them coming - this makes it more difficult to get into than PoG.

But I'm focusing on the negative here, its still a really good game and Id be happy to play it any time - I'd just prefer PoG.

Its really interesting to see all the other theaters represented here (East Africa, Middle East, even Pacific, Eastern Front etc to some extent) and it puts a perspective on the North African theater which as far as i know isnt available in any other game and wouldnt be possibly in a non card driven design. Worth the price of admission for this history lesson alone.

RATING: 9
I'm really enjoying this game right now because there are a lot of things to think about with each card play; I constantly felt as if I were being torn in several directions at once. The different theaters are interesting and add a strategic element to the game as both players have to decide how many resources to expend on what are essentially sideshows, but sideshows worth several VP. I won't give it a 10, yet anyway, for two reasons. First, there seem to be a lot of events that are 'must-play.' It will be interesting to see how often, if ever, circumstances force you to play such cards for Ops instead. Secondly, since so many of the events are part of 'event chains,' it seems like consistently drawing your cards out of order could really hurt your chances of winning.

I was disappointed by this game; perhaps because I only gave it one shot and didn't learn the subtleties.  But it seemed to lack the manoeuvre I would hope for in a game about the Western Desert.  I also didn't like the sequence of play.  The Allies move last and have a much easier time threatening to put the Axis out of supply than the reverse (unlike some other CDGs where out-of-supply is determined after each player's last move)

Played the game thrice.  Jury was still out for me after the 2nd playing.  I needed to try it again as I was feeling as if it was too linear (i.e. some things need to happen).  After the 3rd time I was feeling marginally better BUT again, too many card linearities- this MUST be played now before THAT can be played before THIS is played in 1940-type stuff.  Though, the game has more of a flavor after the 3rd playing.

Components are o.k., but on my oppinion the system will work fin for WW I but not for WW II. Also in this game there are some very critical cards like Barbarossa. If these will not arrive at the right time, it is very hard to win the game.

I'm quite pleased with how Shifting Sands turned out.  Hindsight is 20/20 but aside from some minor issues the game achieves what I hoped for from the beginning:  a not-overly complex operational-level depiction of the war in North Africa that can be played in a single evening.  Players have generally agreed:  a modal rating of "8" and the entire print run was sold.  A finely balanced conflict simulation according to all on-line tournament stats.  The game is out of print but regardless ignore my "10" you have 500+ other people who have rated the game.

A very tightly balanced, very tense CDG.  It plays faster than PoG or WWII: BtB.  Components are beautiful.  The supply rules are well done, making it near impossible for one side or the other to achieve a quick breakthrough victory; it's almost as though your forces are restrained by an elastic band and the farther you move, the more it reigns you in.  Rommel makes playing the Germans interesting as the two column shifts coupled with fast-moving armor allows for the Germans to lay a mighty wallop on the Allies, then disperse.  

My only complaint is the number of exceptions that tend to be buried in the rules, and the strange interactions of some of the events cards.  But overall this is a very exciting, playable, and involving study of the North African campaign.

This a fine example of the CDG genre, one which I am rapidly becoming consumed by - such a great system, so frustrating, so tense. This game is not as epic as B2B but doesn't suffer for it. It is a shorter game, but hindered by some specific exceptions that are there for the all important flavour. Having played a few times, it feels like the Allies have the harder time of it, the clock is really ticking and the pressure is on to ensure the Axis don't hang around in East Africa and near El Alamein.

The game gets better every time I play it and has now worked it's way onto my personal top 10 of all time list. As good as any of the other CDGs out there in my opinion. Nice to see MMP use quality linen stock on the cards as well. The artwork front and back make them the best looking cards in any of the CDGs. 

The game itself is very much your standard CDG but the historical depth in the card play is deeper than most. Great game for wargamers who like their games dripping with history.

RATING: 7
I like this game fairly well for a card driven game.  I think the cards do a good job of scripting the historical flow.  There are also not a lot of "whammy" cards-- ie cards that give the player an incentive to hold until that perfect moment when they can do maximum damage (which I feel give players too much control over history).

I do still think the Ethiopian side show is a bit too detailed and should have been abstracted out, but that's a minor quibble.

Excellent game with tough decisions to make and not enough resources.  The cards allow you to either play an event, use operations points to move and/or attack or redeploy units, or accumulate replacement points to rebuild units.  Most card events give the game good historical flavor, however, Shifting Sands is not really "historical" due to what event cards are played and when.  While the sideshows in the Near East and East Africa is nice, it seems that the British need to put way too much time and resources in those areas than what happend historically.  My main quibble is the length of time it takes to play the campaign game

Played 6 times. For players of PoG it needs only a few minutes to start playing. The game need only 2 evenings and is nice, but with balance problems. To win with the Axis seems very difficult. There are too many cards that the Allies can use both for events AND OP points (25 against only 10 of the Axis). This means that the Axis player is overwelmed: he needs replacements (more than the Allies), but there are events that stop the use of the cards for RP points. And when you play a 3 o 4 value card for replacempents and a couple of cards for events you realize that you have too few OP points to do what you need. On the other side the Allies can play with no brainstorm.
Another problem is a "classic" of about every Desert game: the Italian units are underrated. The Ariete division (one of the best unit of WWII) is a poor 2-2-4 and the infantry divisions of 1942 have the same value of 1940 divisions. As in PoG there is something missing concerning historical research.
In any instance I like the system and I want to give many more try to this game. The map, the cards and the counters are very well done. Maybe fixing the balance problems could help a lot!

Its faster than most.  But it doesn't feel like the war I read about in the history books.  The minor campaigns feel tacked on to make a game.  The Iraq and Syrain campaings were over in a matter of weeks with trivial losses and very modest force commitment by the British.  In the game, "Fortress Damascus" can hold out for months.  The best way to delay the enemy is to put out token infantry forces and make them attack every round at a vast expenditure of resources for the results.  And the critical card phenomena is a show stopper.  I've had games where the Allies drew neither Barbarossa nor Torch.  What's up with that?

The games we've played have been well balanced and very close, so we're looking forward to more. Recommended!

One of the few games to depict the full range of British campaigns in Africa during WWII. The centre stage is the Western desert, but its includes the campaigns in Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia in East Africa; Palestine, Syria and Iraq in the Middle East; and Operation Torch in Algeria and Tunisia. The British have to deal with these widespread fronts and close them down so that they can concentrate on Rommel & Co, who in turn must make the most of these distractions. Like Paths of Glory players need to play events in order to proceed according to history. Personally I rarely bother with tank upgrades as later tank units are stronger anyway and the same event line leads to the Australians being withdrawn because of the fall of Singapore. I also favour the tactic of keeping back my 4 OP Malta cards to be used for replacements or operations at the end of the turn. This Muscular Allied Strategy surprised my more conventional opponent, though he still won (just). Replaced by No Retreat: North Africa Front which deals with the Desert War and the Invasion of Crete in greater detail.

Haven't played yet. Rule book is a big improvement over PoG. Obvioulsy this game borrows heavily from PoG. It will be interesting to see if it has the same "strategic" feel. [After playing: it doesn't. But it's a great game nonetheless. Tense, balanced, and full of historical theme (the interaction of the cards is fascinating). As the Axis player I really got to know the difference between a raid and an offensive. "Shifting Sands" is a very accurate title.]

The upside:
-So detailed, you can learn a lot about the North Africa front of WWII. You have decks split in years, with several events of the war coming more or less at the same time as they happened back then.

The downside:
-Not very easy to get into this PoG system, although there's an excelent vassal tutorial made by airjudden.

Although I enjoy this game and it has several good game mechanics and is tense, I'm not sure that the historical outcome can be replicated very well.

Somebody before me put the finger right on the spot:
"After several plays, I've come to the conclusion that there is not much decision-making in the game. Cards should almost always be played for the event. The order in which certain cards appear is terribly important- the difference between an early or late Barbarossa could be the game."

A pity that this game only uses the PoG rules, but fails to create the tension and atmosphere that PoG gives me every time. 
In two words: bored now!

Rating after one partial play.  This was an enjoyable game with a lot of action and some fun swings.  It has the same problem I think most of these CDGs have, which is that knowledge of the deck, in advance, is critical to competent play.  It's a beating to get messed up by an event card you had no idea existed.  Actually, this isn't a big problem if both players are equally ignorant; in that case, it sort of feels like the random vagaries of war and is fun.  But if one player knows the deck, he has a huge advantage, making it tough to bring new players in.

Components look fantastic.  This is my first CDG game, I really like the scope of the game where the entire theatre can be played in one game.  I like the non hex map which I find more appealing, being a big area/ impulse game fan.  The cards are an interesting twist to injecting historical actions into a game.  I cannot comment on replay value yet, due to limited playing but I guess the random card draw would allow for enjoyable replay value.  The rules are straightforward and easy to follow, which is important for players who have never played with the CDG mechanics.  

I need to play this game more to finalize my rating but after initial plays I have become a CDG fan.  The PtP map just works better for me then hexes above the tactical level and I find the card play very involved and just add's to the strategy.  A consim. its not, and I am very grateful for that.

After a few plays I have found there is a learning curve, but it is well worth the effort.  I like the hand management aspect.  The card play is a little scripted but I find it works well within the scope of the game. 

After additional games played I have determined I just stink at it.  I fail miserably as the Axis and do not do well against a strong Allied player.  I still enjoy the hand management aspect of the first half of the game, but tire quickly and almost never play through to the end.  It has my gaming pet peeve, VP hang on, you are losing but hoping to keep that one last VP spot for a backdoor victory.

An good game utilizing many Barbarossa to Berlin concepts, but with a 5 hour play time.  Very high replay value and the sub-maps have been cleverly worked into the game without detracting from the primary action in North Africa.  I am a bit concerned that a given side can be overly handicapped by cards coming in the wrong order, but I am not sure it is any worse than any other CDG that uses the cards to drive the meta events, such as POG.

Update:  I have downgraded my rating on this game based on issues with play balance and the Malta race mechanic.  Right now, the game seems to be heavily slanted to the Allies and I will sit back and see if that either fixes itself through improved strategies or the designer fixes it with rules changes.  My other beef is with the race to either capture Malta or make it victorious.  This game is not POG and it is very possible to never see all your cards and, as a result, through no fault of your own, you lose the Malta race.  That is a tremendous swing in resources (cards) and replacements for the Axis and, in my mind, too much to just leave up to chance.  I would have preferred that the Malta conflict just be scripted instead of luck driven mechanic for it based on what is at stake.

The PoG system just doesn't work well for the desert war. The great ranges back and forth across the desert are not represented and East Africa takes up too much of the focus in 1940-41. Limited strategic options makes the game quite a bit less interesting than PoG and PuG.

Not a bad effort at all. Complexity level is below that of PoG. Sure, alot of systems are mirrored here but the game plays quite different: very fluid, fast moving with the usual agony of wanting to do alot but not being able to do so.

Very enjoyable game.  Some have criticized the card draw for being too influential on how the game develops, but I like the variability that creates--some games the Iraqi revolt just isn't going to work out, and some games the battle for Malta can't be won.  I also think the designer has done a good job of pushing the envelope with card design for a CDW in creating cards which impact victory points and/or the other player's hand directly.

UPDATE:  Well, I played it to death.  And it died.  I have no desire to play it any more.

I enjoyed it while it lasted, but in the end the deck drives the players' victory prospects too much, the Axis is too underpowered and uninteresting, and there were a few big hiccups in the early game that we had to manage around in the later games.

Still, if a game makes it to 10-15 plays that's good value for money.

Based on two plays.

Yes, it's a Paths of Glory/Barbarossa to Berlin rip off, does that make it a bad game - absolutely not! The game is visually stunning.

The game focuses even more than PoG on events; virtually every card you play is an event and the size of the card deck decreases fast. This increases the amount of luck needded in the card draw. If you don't get the right cards at the right time, you're fudged.

Still it captures the med campaign very nicely and plays very fast (half the time of PoG). It is a good game which can hold it's own in the never ending flood of CDGs.

I still find it oddly discomforting that the the same system PoG uses to simulate WWI is exported to both B2B and SS to simulate WW2.  I like PoG a lot.  SS and B2B not so much.

A twin to [gameid=91].  I am finally willing to admit to myself that I don't really care for this game.  I have pulled it out several times, both solitaire and with different opponents, but have never found the magic.  My biggest gripe with the game is that it is so unforgiving.  The ruleset is unforgiving, as you must spend a significant amount of time explaining the game and it's many gotchas before you jump in.  The positional gameplay is unforgiving, as a foolish mistake can see several divisions cut out of supply or helpless as a gigantic armor stack aims to eradicate them.  Even the cardplay is unforgiving, as there are some very strict sequences of events, and falling behind on them can punish you severely.  Instead of having fun with the game, exploring the system, and trying out new tricks, I have to concentrate oh-so-hard to avoid mistakes.  Not the feeling I want when I'm playing a game.

Preliminary rating, hoping it goes up.  The CDG implementation feels a bit off here.  There is much less tension between card roles than in other games, mostly due to overpowered/must-play events.  This keeps the game on track historically (and even off-rails stuff like the Near East doesn't throw it way off) but sacrifices something in the "pure game" context. I really like the fact that the different theaters are represented (most games on this topic abstract that out).  I like that combat cards have been beefed up to be more useful, too.

Another play is warranted before coming to any final conclusions, but I fear that fundamentally the designer wants history to come first, and it shows in the gameplay.

A very good CDG on the WWII North Africa campaign.  This game is modeled after the successful Paths of Glory game system.  A good reenactment of the campaign that takes into account the eastern African theater as well as the middle-east factors the British had to deal with.  Quality components and a beautiful map comparable to GMT products.

RATING: 6
Looking good so far.  Some great graphics on cards and map.  In fact, the cards are the best looking cards ive ever seen in a CDG.  

Very promising, and a lot of fun.  I really like the fact it is playable in one sitting if nobody has analysis paralysis.  I think this will be considered the definitive desert wargame, at least in my collection.  Like all CDG's it is important to know all the cards to play well.  Seems to model the frustration the Germans had with replacements and the issues the Brits had with juggling different theaters + keep Rommel at bay.  Very tense, both sides usually feel like they are losing.  

The Italians are modeled just fine, they can use combat cards, do flank attacks and have many steps to absorb losses.  Italians corsetted by even one German armor battlegroup can do some damage.  I don't think anyone doubts the bravery of individual Italian soldiers, but they were poorly organized and had obsolete equipment....the game handles them well.

With mechanics inherited from other CDG like Barbarossa to Berlin or Paths of Glory, the system doesn't have the flavour of a game about Rommel . Static forces trying to break the enemy's front in one point doesn't sound to me like a desert wargame should be.

Nice game about WWII in Africa, including the Horn. Like of Path of Glory for many aspects.

Interesting scenario and cards.  While the core rules are not that difficult, they are many unique rules and exceptions that make this game a bit fiddly and cause you to frequently reference the rule book.  Make sure you get the living rules and some player aids.  I also found the game pretty scripted as to where you were fighting at any particular time and which cards you played.

RATING: N/A
Shifting Sands is not my first choice for a med-front wargame (Rommel in the Desert has the age advantage), but a game with a reputation for having faithfully transposed the lauded Paths of Glory rules into a much shorter game cannot be passed-over by the discriminating gamer.  Mike Rinella has also developed a great track record for himself, so I'm definitely hopeful for the future of my opinions of this game.

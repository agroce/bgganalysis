What a great game .a weekend to read the rules a few times,but after a few game turns and a bit of looking back at the rules it all falls into place.
You just have to play the next turn to see what is going to happen.won my first game after 6 goes.
once you get the rules the game turns go quicky ,it's the 10 minutes sitting there trying to decide to send your boys up to engage a raid or not.
then the game gets you .....what was a small raid on a radar station turns out to be a 4 squadrons of 109's on a fighter sweep and you get jumped ,then the big raid comes in.
the german tactics work very well ..sometimes to well.
if you play it rigth and some good die rolling you win,if you just wade in there your dead in three weeks.

TIP OF THE DAY 
ROLL 6's FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO AND 1's FOR EVERYTHING THE GERMANS DO........EASY .
love playing it

really tense and uncomplicated solitaire game. excellent fun, and it is nice tracking your favourite squadrons.
the main campaign is really long and a bit of a drag since you mainly lose, but really satisfying to complete.
Could use some fantasy scenarios or alternative maps/aircraft.

Play tested RAF II 2-player and German solo for John Butterfield. Looking forward to the updated version.  12/25/08  Currently reviewing RAF:Lion (British solo) for John.  I've played 2 games through so far.  Excellent game system, very fun. Much improved over his venerable first RAF title.

I can see how this would get old or routine after a while, but that's a problem that you're going to face with many solitaire games.  I'm just starting on it and am finding it enjoyable.  It's a much higher level game than B-17, but there is still a fair amount of tension.

The game itself is fairly simple and low complexity. Once you get the mechanics down it's fairly straightforward.

Solo game reacquired after many years. I used to stay up all night as a teenager playing through the full Battle of Britain scenario. 20 something years later, the game does show its age a bit. It's a little fiddly with all of the moving of the plane counters, and having the result of each combat rest on 1 die roll, mehhhh. But it is still fun and I will be breaking it out again soon.

Few examples and hard to wrap your head around.

But a nice game.

Nice mechanics, good flow of play, and tense! :)  It has been interesting looking at the Battle of Britain this way as opposed to that in London's Burning.  RAF gives you the feel of being the C-in-C while London's Burning gives you the feel of being a squadron commander.  I am a strategic player at heart, so RAF is awesome!  I would recommend this game highly to anyone who wants a good game that reflects this critical battle.  After 14 plays, this game still holds its own.  Great fun each and every time!  And I FINALLY won!!!! :D  Luftwaffe 15, Tim 2. :)

It's a decent solitaire game, and I rather like the way in which it models the Luftwaffe's changing priorities during the campaign.

Loses marks for being solitaire (sorry, just prefer playing ftf games, even if I'm playing against myself), and for containing some distinctly (IMO) ahistorical aspects that detract from my enjoyment (to whit, the use of fatigue rather than casualties in determining the efficacy of RAF squadrons, and the excessive effectiveness of LW attacks on radar and airfields).

This is one of those games I feel like I should like more than I actually do.  Perhaps I will warm up to it more over time.

It is certainly more of a "simulation" or "story generator" than a traditional game, as it feels like the number of significant decision points is a little light.

Perhaps the thing I had trouble with is that I didn't feel like I learned that much historical background from playing the game.  When I compare this to, say, "The Dambuster Raid", which is a similar "simulation"-style game, there's no comparison:  Dambuster does an amazing job and teaches you all sorts of details about that actual conflict.  Maybe that's actually bad for some people, but I relish that sort of thing.

An interesting concept for a solitaire game, in that it's driven by 3 separate decks of cards (target, force, event).  Rules are poorly written, and it can get a little tedious, and frustrating, watching the endless hordes of German planes while your planes are grounded due to fatigue on the second day of the campaign.  Still, a strong entry in the solitaire category.

RAF is the best solitaire war game I've ever played, mostly because it's so darned PLAYABLE.  The rules are easy to follow, and the card-driven nature of events gives you an amazing variety of air battles to fight.  There's no "one best strategy" that leads to victory consistently; I've beaten that nasty Luftwaffe as well as having my tail kicked by it.  There's a simple method for fighting battles, and a very user-friendly method for "healing" damaged pilots and planes.  It's just a very fun game to play.

Another solitaire classic from Butterfield.  One of my all-time most-played games, apart from system games like ASL.  I've played the full campaign literally dozens of times, and it's always engaging.

This is not a typical hex/ZOC wargame.  Far from it.  Everything about this game is innovative, especially considering it's time, and it shows just how much of a pioneer of game-design John Butterfield really is.  He used cards, counters, and map in a novel way to simulate a campaign using systems that he invented out of whole-cloth- there was nothing like it before this game.

The result?  A game that works exceedingly well.  You play out each day of the Battle of Britain, raid by raid, sending up your squadrons on patrol in the various sectors of the map as you see fit.  Then you resolve each day's raids, one by one, drawing a Target card for each raid, rolling dice to determine your detection, and sending up intercepting squadrons as you choose and are able.  Card draws determine the number and composition of enemy 109s/110s/bombers in each raid, and event cards make each card unique (as well as determining how many hours tick off the clock for each raid).  It all comes together brilliantly, to create an examination of the entire campaign on a day-by-day, raid-to-raid basis, which has tactical elements but is still very much grounded in a long-term, operational, resource-management campaign.  Not only one of the best WW2 operational air games of all time, but also one of the best solo games of all time.  

Keeping in mind that this game was published decades ago, by the long-defunct West End Games, the physical components were just fine.  The map is still a beauty, and I MUCH prefer it to the newer, pastel, antiseptic RAF2 map.  The only knock on the components would be the cards, which were cardboard, and came in perforted sheets and had to be separated... far from poker-quality cards.  But that is a sign of the times... this game pre-dated the first edition of Magic by several years and precious few wargames had cards at all.  I've been playing it for 3 decades and my cards are still plenty serviceable and will last another couple decades.  I won't even deduct for the cards... this game deserves a perfect 10.

This is one of my "grail" games. I played it as a youth, and lost it or gave it away. Recently, I was lucky enough to score another copy. I generally dislike hex and counter games, but only because of the "fiddliness" of the small pieces. I have a hard time maneuvering them around without flipping them all over the floor. Nonetheless, I love this game. It's very tense, and there are tons of meaningful decisions to make. It's got great replay value, and takes a while to "break the code" and determine the best possible strategy. (Although some would argue this point)If you enjoy the theme, the Battle of Britain, or like aerial combat, this might be for you. Be warned however, that the rules are not organized very well. They're short, slightly obtuse, but thankfully complete. A truly great solitaire game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Great play and replay value. The solitaire system is one of the best all around. I've downloaded the new counters available and use them instead of the originals and it really makes a diference to have those (it really brings a new life to the game). If possible try to get this one if you're into the solitaire gameplay. You are constantly in face of hard choices to make, to save your forces to face the next major raid, or commit now to try to destroy gruppen but in doing so to lose some squadrons to fatigue?In my opinion it's one of the best solitaire games around.

The good is that the intelligence, scramble, and combat systems work together well and play quickly.  You very soon learn that attacks against radars, airfields, and fighter command should be taken seriously.  My main problem with this game is that victory is entirely dependent on eliminating German gruppen, which advocates an ahistorical Big Wing strategy to overwhelm certain raids, usually at the cost of letting others through.  Furthermore, the Patrolling Squadrons Land and German Relief events feel random and can frustratingly ruin your day/week/campaign.  I'm eagerly awaiting the 2nd edition of this game as the changes John Butterfield describes should address my above problems with the system.

Now have a second copy as my first one is wearing out or at least the counters are looking a little worse for wear!

Now starting up another day by day campaign game starting today 11th August. Game campaign starts on the 11th so it seemed appropriate! Let's see how long I can last this time. 

Starting another full campaign game of this one. Again will see just how far I can get. Hopefully won't run out of steam with it like I did last year!

Well... got bombed out of the 2015 75th Anniversary Campaign on August 31st at a staggering -48 Points. Decided to start up a short Campaign as a continuation. So August 27th is the new start date. Trying to get back on track to align actual days and current date to commemorate the 75th Anniversary.

RAF is a very good solitaire game despite poorly written rules, an ugly map that mostly consists of holding boxes and charts and unattractive counters. Unlike almost every other solitaire game, the game-play is largely streamlined to minimise random actions, dice rolling and card turning so that once you're familiar with the system it becomes a very quick playing game - by no means the marathon that others complained about. The key to victory is to be patient during light and normal raiding but to hammer the Luftwaffe during heavy raiding as it commits suicide by sending increasingly weaker and fragile forces against you. Random events such as 'patrols grounded' and 'Luftwaffe support' prevent this from being a perfect plan but it is ultimately a winning one that cracks the soltaire 'puzzle' and the game has less replay value after that.

I was expecting great things given how popular this seems to be in its various editions. Unfortunately, I found it to be rather dry and repetitive. 

More problematic was the fact that I never really felt like I was in control of Fighter Command in any real sense - the focus of the game is very limited and almost entirely focuses on where and when units should be deployed. I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on personnel and tactics and rather more detail concerning the composition and changing effectiveness of each unit.

That lack of operational and logistical detail / variety probably wouldn't have bothered me so much if there'd been a bit more to the tactical element of the game but that too is very abstract, very repetitive and very unsatisfying in terms of player input.

RATING: 6
I used to consider this to be the greatest solitaire game ever made, but a recent play suggested that it hasn't aged well.  Card draws determine the composition of Luftwaffe raids, and send them at British targets.  (Often Biggin Hill airfield, as for some reason four of the forty target cards pick on this hapless target.)  The game models fatigue above all else, a questionable design decision.  The combat results table is interesting. Half of the squadrons (and Gruppen) are assigned "+" markers, and the other half "o" markers.  The CRT often calls for only + or o squadrons to take damage.  While elegant in theory, it leads to really gamey play based on knowledge of the CRT.  The victory point system, which triggers Operation Sea Lion if it gets too low, is pretty goofy.  Why does the bombing of London, for example, make an invasion more likely?  However, I think that my biggest problem is just that there are not that many decisions to make in this game.  You are prohibited from making strategic decisions (such as evacuating certain airfields and pulling north).  The game therefore is just one of tactical reactions to German raids, picking the best mix of + and o squadrons and Gruppen, and seeing what the CRT yields.  After a while, the repetition gets old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My general feeling about this game is that the amount of action in a turn doesn't justify the hassle of moving squadrons into patrols and moving them back. Most of the time I'd rather play a 2-player game against myself rather than drawing a bunch of cards.

I wanted to like this game. I certanly put in a ton of time learning how to play. Alas, I did not feel the payoff was there. It just is not that fun. I do not know if I have ever experienced a game that unfolded soooooo slowly. No real tension in the game. No real thrill at taking out bombers and no sense of disaster at missed strikes.

Here is another solo game I played a lot, but I sold it during my big clear-out of 2004-5.

It takes quite a long time to play, however it gives a good feeling of being on the brink of defeat until you can manage to pull out a major victory.

The strategy which works best for me is to defend as much as possible with the minimum necessary number of squadrons, and hang on until the Luftwaffe are getting tired too.

At that stage, you assemble a "big wing" formation from your fresh squadrons, and try get it into contact with a large, tired luftwaffe bomber formation.

The game is not very complex in itself but it was pesented so, mostly because of a poor rule organization and the sequence of hunter-squadron-bomber combat.  Perhaps more good examples of play can remedy this. But the game situation (and the Battle over Britain) itself is exceptionally interesting in that the German Luftwaffe and bombers flying all over Britain finding the attack targets as determined by the game system (as well as the size of the air raids), while the British is teethed to death as to how to deploy her limited interception resources, inculding the radar intelligence and the intercept fighters.  

The game has two unique features: 1) It is a solitaire game 2) It is a card-driven solitaire game, where card-driven game is so popular nowadays (but not so back then).  You can only play the game solitaire from the British side and the use of cards added the intense moment and flavour facing the unknow terror from the German air attacks.  A clever design and a good  game.  It is a good simulation too.  You'll get no closer experience of sandpushing in an intelligence war room in the R.A.F. headquarter than this.  

The only concern I have is the rather scripted target selection process as dictated by the shuffled card deck. The predetermined targets by the cards means the overall campaign sets the rate of attacks on specific type of targets, with agreeable historical or not-so agreeable historical statistical occurrence. It means that the general German bombing strategy could not "deviate" from that of the target cards. 

I felt like really standing in the middle of the British War Room inside the strategic air command, sand-pushing the combat planes in the ready-takeoff-combat style. I haven't bought the new DG edition because, sorry, I thought the game was somewhat easy to beat.  But I am interested in trying out the Luftwaffe side some other day if I have the chance.

I own a "self made copy", but I haven't yet give up the hope to have a real one.. move on to the game... the sytstem is well thought, simple and fun. The German programmed opponent do a creditable job and it's difficult to beat; you have to find a way to resist the temptation to deploy big wings against him because doing that will greatly reduce your response to follow up raids. In my first play the Luftwafee had employed 12 days to blast me out of the sky, but it has been a really enjoyable experience.
Looking forward to try again.

This was one of the very first games I played as a kid, and it still holds up today. Every decision - which planes to send on patrol, how many, in what sector, which ones do I commit to battle - will have you biting your nails, since as the RAF you're outnumbered and outgunned. 

It's just a brilliant solitaire system, the Germans act intelligently and adjust their strategy with the calendar and the weather, and I guarantee you will sweat out every single day hoping you can push off Operation Sealion.

A classic.

RATING: 6.5
A fine solitaire design that has problems with historicity. Like Butterfield's Battle Over Britain the driver of the RAF's response is fatigue, which has no historical basis. Historically, fatigue was not a brake on the ability of controllers to scramble squadrons, nor did it contribute to the huge attrition rates we see in this game. As a result the game fails to generate historical sortie rates and responses to raids. The card selection of Luftwaffe targets is also less than historical. As one example, the game generates far more raids on radar than in history. That said, the game is very ludic with many neat mechanics. As history it disappoints but as a Battle of Britain-themed game it works just fine.

RATING: 8
If you know your Battle of Britain history then this solitaire game is very atmospheric. You decide which available RAF forces to commit to the fight as the game system determines the strength and target of the Luftwaffe. It can be a very delicate balancing act deciding whether to employ specific squadrons, or perhaps if it's worth sending out depleted units. The main targets will be the precious RAF airfields; just as in the real conflict, callous though it sounds, it's a relief when the target is instead a city or a port, for instance. This gives the 'few' a bit of time to recover and regroup. Bad weather is even better as there are no attacks, although the Luftwaffe also benefits from this recovery time. As the campaign progresses, the modifiers tend to favour the RAF, and once the Luftwaffe starts to target London more regularly (and also if the German fighters are tethered to the role of bomber close escort rather than a more aggressive fighter-interception task) then the tide has well and truly turned, and Hitler's invasion of Britain is likely to be cancelled. If the game plays out in a historical fashion, it can be a real nail-biter.

The Good: the solitaire game system does a good job of recreating the German bombing campaign, so there's a real sense of history brought to life as the British try to defend against the seemingly endless raids. The Bad: the game takes a long time to play, and the endless reshuffling of the cards is tiresome.

My favorite solitaire wargame.  John Butterfield took his already-good Battle Over Britain and sweated it down to produce this.  Really puts the player in the shoes of Air Marshal Dowding, and doesn't force you to do a lot of fiddly stuff that was below his level.  It's a better simulation than any two-player Battle of Britain game because the system behaves more like the historical Luftwaffe (which was handicapped by poor intelligence -- in both senses of the word) than any wargamer with historical hindsight would.

The system's been kicking me around and stomping me to ground, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Great game.
UPDATE:
Finally beat the Luftwaffe in a full game. Still loving the game.
Lots of luck and dice rolling. Half a dozen critical dice rolls in a row can make or break the game for you.

The best solitaire game ever. Players control RAF Fighter Command as it battles a steady stream of card-controlled Germans crossing the Channel and looking for targets. Tension mounts as the number of squadrons in the rest and damage boxes increases, and the loss of airfields and radar installations can have devastating effects on the ability to detect and counter raids.

Another diamond by my favorite designer, John H. Butterfield. 

This is probably the easiest to learn out of the "Big 3" (Ambush!, RAF, D-Day at Omaha Beach) solitaire designs, however, it is definitely the most brutal and relentless, with a couple bad dice rolls causing massive devastation and VP loss. The fact that RAF can potentially be won with negative points really says a lot about it. The Luftwaffe will be successful in a ton of their bombing raids, whether you send out intercepting squadrons or not. 

RAF is a highly defensive game about minimizing damage and VP loss, with an almost "Push-your-luck" type feel. It also has more of a 'ride' feel than DDaOB, as dice rolls are extremely important, and some days you may just be watching the Luftwaffe bomb everything without any opposition. 

Great game. Highly recommended. Very tense and narrative.

Found at an antique store for $15, a good deal for a complete game in good shape. 

Another Butterfield game played, and further proof he is the king of ALL solo games, not just solo wargames. So many tough calls, so much narrative. As a bonus, the game handles the subject matter very well. You'll feel a heavy heart as bombs hit their targets, and feel the desperation as a large enemy force materializes on the board.  

I still prefer his other games (the D-Day series and Ambush!) to RAF, but doesn't mean it isn't still a fantastic game and a wonderful solo game. It's tough and often brutal, but that's what I've come to love and expect from his designs.

A great solo game with the advantage of being designed for solitaire play rather than having solitaire rules as an added extra.

Playing can reflect the feeling of RAF command who must be a paranoia of potential major German raid.

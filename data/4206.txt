This is a fairly complicated operational level ACW game. For my taste a bit too detailed and somewhat dry. It does what it sets out to do but you must really want to travel these roads.

Brilliant system and best coverage of the Operational aspects of this campaign. The Rebs are best to get to Gettysburg first and dig in, and burn lots of railroads while they're at it. Where the hell is Jeb Stuart when you need him?

Excellent volume of the GCACW series. There are 6 scenarios contained within this volume (plus another standalone here: http://www.gcacw.com/4thday.htm). However, the only one worth playing, once you know the full system, is scenario 6 the Gettysburg campaign. It plays to the full scope of the system, which emphasises division scale manoeuvre and co-ordinated assault, because it is essentially a meeting engagement between two armies. It also illustrates elegantly what an accident the battle of Gettysburg was. Our first playing had it's first major engagement at Bolivar, around 30 miles South South West of Gettysburg, primarily because of the random entry of the Army of the Potomac (they came very early in this one). This makes the replayability relatively high compared with some of the other volumes in this series. 
The maps are beautiful, probably the best in any wargame I have played.

Good, obviously. It's GCACW after all. With the Skirmisher changes it's a very good game. But somehow, though it's the shiny 'all-star' campaign of the war, it isn't the most interesting to play for some reason. I'd always reach for HCR or SJWII, or BATC before this one. I would love to play a double blind campaign game of this though...

Bought it years ago and it is still unpunched.  With the price it is going for now on eBay, I am reluctant to punch it now.  Picked up Stonewall Jackson's Way used recently so I can finally try out the system without the agony of punching Roads to Gettysburg.  Not for sale or trade.

The map is so beautiful. Oh the map! Just unfold it and follow Lee's trail north with your eyes.

I have to replay the game. You can find a lot of problems like a too flexible union Army of the Potomac (incorporating all this useless PA militia) and above all too few fog of war.
There is an optional rule about fog of war in the skirmisher/1 magazine, perhaps it helps.

Great system and beautiful maps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This system well captures the feel of maneuvering and coordinating a large 19th century army. The player must account for terrain, time, space, fatigue, uncertainty, and, of course, the enemy. You may want to "get thar fustest with the mostest", but find that your troops are now brittle for being pushed too hard. The problems presented are difficult and absorbing (four hours of play pass in what seems an instant) and the game play is fast because the players alternate the movement of units based on initiative die rolls--you won't wait around for long to move. The counters are as awful as the maps are beautiful, but maybe that is for the best--it might be too much to create the counterset that would not detract from these fantastic maps. The rules and playaids are clear and complete to round out an excellent package. The handling of large battles is not quite as satisfying or convincing, especially for those of us who play the monster tactical ACW games. But perhaps it would be asking too much of this operational system to deliver the same realistic feel to battle as it does to maneuver. The only other knock is the lack of limited intelligence rules, which renders cavalry almost meaningless. Luckily, there is a fix to be found in Pat Hirtle's excellent add-on available in The General or The Skirmisher magazines. This system is a must for the ACW grognard looking for rich detail and long hours of tense gaming.

This is my favorite game in the GCACW series, both because of the topic and the number of options available to the CSA player. Like all the other games, graphics are superb, very elegant game system, and lots of replay value. These days you probably can't find this one for under $100, but it's worth every penny.

GCACW is excellent for campaigns such as Gettysburg. I've always felt that the interesting part of Gettysburg was not the battle itself, despite the profusion of wargames on the battle, but why the battle was fought at Gettysburg. RTG was built precisely to answer that question.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Brilliant operational-level game of the Gettysburg campaign.  The GCACW series gives a much better view of the war, since Lee had often wupped the Union through maneuver before the first shot had even been fired.  A must-own for ACW geeks.

Like all of the games in the GCACW series, this is a good one.  Previously, I owned all of the games in the series, but I eventually sold them all because I played them so much, that I got burned out.  In my opinion, the lowest point of this game is the poorly made counters.  They have a dull finish, are cheaply made, and some are off-centered.  In an effort to help their appearance, owners will have to clip off the dog-ears and smooth out the sides with a fingernail clipper.  Even this does not approve them too much.  Despite this, I would recommend this game.

RATING: 7
Aside from 'Here Come the Rebels', this was the best of the GBACW game series. The forces somehow often seemed to meet up at or near Gettysburg for a great clash- despite all of the space. My only quibble about the game is the lack of fog of war- each side knows too much about where the other is. I used to only play this solo, but setting up the maps and watching the campaigns unfold was like witnessing history repeating itself- differently. 'Can't believe I sold this a long time ago for $40- I'd like to reaquire a copy but it's just too much $$$$! Downside is the horribly plain & boring counter art.
I prefer this theater over any others in the series.

RATING: 7
The basic game scenarios are rather contrived to force a fight. I think the advanced game scenario replicates the history better. Lee was on a raid and wasn't trying to force a fight at any particular location. If he found one to advantage, so much the better; but it could happen anywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

My favorite wargame
The maps are artwork ; the campaign very exiting : you have a very few counters at the beginning on the maps and you don't know where the clash will take place..
Just one critic : why don't Hancock and Reynolds have the rating of Ewell and Hill and vice versa ?

Of all the GCACW this is my least favorite. Rather than maneuvering to set up a meety battle, the way too few scenarios are mostly about maneuvering on a huge scale. It's almost as if the battles were an afterthought. I get GCACW is operational, but the scale is too big for my prefernce

Initial rating based on solitaire play of one scenario (using the standard GCACW rules from Grant Takes Command and the updated counters from Skirmisher #1).  I like the way the fatigue rules work to limit what units can do.  The randomness of the activations works well at the operational level, but it can really be decisive in who "gets there fuhstest with the mostest".  Still, the GCACW gives players a lot of decisions to make in a system that plays fast and recreates the eastern theater battles on some of the best wargame maps ever.  Worth the price to acquire if you're an ACW wargamer.

Great series with great production values!! It is about simulating all the campaigns of the American Civil War (ACW) at operational level. The series has a beautiful and natural flowing game system with the right balance between playability and realism. The rulebook is so informative and well written that every game mechanics is so logically explained that you hardly have to memorise them. The rulebook alone worth the whole game price. A day by day historical account and insightful analysis of the campaign with hex numbers of the key battle location and cities/ towns is included. Not even to mention the extraordinary historical game maps, useful summary of tables in the player aid cards, portrait of every major leaders participating in the campaign, lots of scenarios etc. Key features include: variable movement of battle force, leader initiatives, morale, force march, train movement, breastworks and fortifications, hidden force strength, logging of ammunition level, flank attack, supply and foraging, etc. Plus, all the game maps in the series can be joined to recreate virtually the entire conflict in the eastern theatre!! The best game series about the ACW so far in the history of wargame. Plus, Road to Gettysburg is the campaign about the greatest battle of the entire American Civil War. How can you miss? Hats off to the veteran wargame designer Joseph Bolkoski!!

RATING: 7.25
Superb instalment of a classic system. The longer view of this campaign helps put some questions in perspective that the more typical battle simulations do not. For instance, why did Lee advance East of the mountains? He was lucky that Meade did not aggressively follow up after the battle as my game of scenario 5 showed. Getting back across the mountain passes is not easy while being harried by keen Union Corps.
A really absorbing system and this game is a way of learning new things about an often simulated subject.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Good game. Some fiddly bits, but overall, the basic game works very well. Decent, if uninspired components. Needs more playing time. I really enjoy this series of games. Only got through half of the 8 turn advanced scenario before Maryland and Pennsylvania were annihilated by Felis Destructor. Sigh...

One other issue, the victory points for Scenario 5 essentially force a confrontation at Gettysburg--no real room for deviations from history. However, the advanced, full campaign game allows for much greater flexibility. Battles still tend to concentrate around Harper's Ferry and the center of the map, though.

The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series is solid gold in my book. I find the Civil War fascinating, but my main interest is European history. So it isn't just the period covered that makes it great for me. The games in the series are examples of wargames at their finest. The maps are very detailed and look fantastic, and the games are complex enough to give fine detail to the campaigns but not so much that they require huge amounts of time to play. They have a great mix of playability and meatiness. The historical simulation of the battles is excellent. All of these features combine to give players the needed substance to experience how these campaigns played out.

This is the best operational level game of the ANV's 1863 summer campaign this civil war buff and gaming fanatic has ever played. That said, it's not perfect. The advanced game is not well balanced as it tends to favor the CSA and there are only a few basic scenarios included compared to the most recent additions to the GCACW series like On to Richmond and Grant Takes Command. Still, it is an interesting and educational simulation of the campaign and the advanced game is accessible to gamers of all levels.

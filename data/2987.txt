I really think this game is under rated. While it isn't the perfect game it does do a great job of getting players to interact. It has good thematic elements. It is a quick game to learn and a quick game to play. The parts are all very well made and the board is beautiful!

This is one of the first modern/Euro board games I played. It has turn selection as well as potential battle. All of the games have turned out very entertaining. The pirate drifting around the board is always a fun task to take on.

Not necessarily my favorite game, but it can be a lot of fun.  A good amount of luck and randomness and just pirate fun.  If you're looking for a light game with lots of shooting at your buddies, this is a good game for you.  I enjoy it and some folks seem to love it, but there are just some games I would rather play.  Beautiful game too, that certainly helps.

Very chaotic, much more so than I normally enjoy. With this game chaos seems to fit the theme quite well, so it's a bit better. I'll need to see how it stands up after another play or two.

I had my first game of this.  I quite enjoyed it, we played with 4 people so there was a lot of fighting going on.  I played after 3 sessions of Descent so it was nice to have a quicker, lighter game as well.  I think I would play more with non-gamers than my gaming buddies though.

RATING: 10
This is wonderful.  You have to play it as a light game and not as a serious brain-burner.  If you do, then this is hard to beat.  It'll never replace Euphrate and Tigris for depth, but that's not the point is it?

So  why does it deserve a 10?  Well, it's got - great player interaction, reasonable strategy (choosing whether to go for tavern cards, gold, treasure, upgrades etc), edge-of-seat tactics during battle and a superbly linked theme, which brings a huge amount of fun. On top of that, the components are superb.

One of the best things about the game is that there's an opportunity to make your own cards (esp the dangerous Legendary Pirates) and you can decide to work with your fellow players as well as attempt to better them.  A myriad of minor varitations add interest.  I'd recommend "the drunken pirate," parlay, kidnapped, press gang  and some of the other cards suggested on the dedicated Days of Wonder Web-site.  I've put forward a few ideas there myself and everyone's very helpful and friendly.  You can add your own Legendary Pirates - I've made a complete set of six new ones.

Let me defend this game from the oft made criticism that a player can be out of contention after a poor first round or two when you get beaten in battle.  It's just not true.  First, there are several ways of avoiding battle if that's what you want to do. Second, there are several paths to victory, most of which I've taken and triumphed with.  Third, I've actually seen a friend lose 3 battles in the first 4 rounds and still win the game.  He did this by first collecting a large number of tavern cards, then beating the navy, then burying loads of treasure.  Fourth, hey doesn't Age of Steam put players with a bad start out of the game?  The accusation is actually truer for AoS than it is for PC, yet the former doesn't get the same amount of flack about that that this does.  

There is a certain breed of gamer about - you know the type, who considers it his solemn duty to pick holes in any game he finds - especially if it commits the heinous sin of being a light, highly themed, fun game.  Pirate's Cove is their sort of target.  Yet, this game does exactly what it says on the box. In this, it succeeds gloriously where sometimes other games fail, so what is their point? 

If you want a colourful, extremely entertaining, fun game with a fair degree of luck (well this is a Pirate Game for heaven's sake), a fair amount of strategy and tactics when you study it, a strong theme and lots of player interaction - well, you've just found it.  Ignore those who love only heavy, dry games and seek to sink this one.  Let them seek their perfect ideal of a game elsewhere.  Buy this if you like fun!

Lots of fun. This is a game with lots of atmosphere, where decisions matter but luck plays a large part. Tends to bring the pirate out in people! The biggest negative I would say about it is that it is quite fiddly to teach to non-gamers (boat statistics and combat/volley cards are no-brainers to many gamers, but it's a lot to take in for others)

It looks nice being a Days of Wonder production but the game doesn't function very well, once you have lost a battle you are almost completely out of the game because there will be one weak section of your ship that you need to repair and if that island has the legendary pirate or another player who can exploit your weakness again then you lose another fight. A couple of the parrot cards seem quite over powered as well.

+ Cool board and pieces; Customizing your ship is fun and satisfying.
- Combat ended up being just a little bland compared to what I hoped it would be.


Why it's previously-owned:
For a pirate-themed game, it didn't feel very pirate-y most of the time.  Plus, another game came along that did the theme to a whole new degree for us. 
I gave this to a friend and his wife (who loves pirates) for their wedding.

RATING: 8
FUN, FUN, FUN, our family&#039;s most played game.  This is a fun game and even though there is fighting it is not vindictive.  The board is colorful and the pieces very good quality.  It definitely keeps your interest, and plays a very quick 45-60 minutes.  If there were a downside it would be that the use of all the different cards can sometimes get confusing.  If they could make the card play a little more structured, we&#039;re looking at a 9 or 10.  Overall a good game that I will play whenever asked, but I&#039;m not likely to bring it out.  Oh, one more thing.  I have played this game now 5 times against kids only (ages 8-13).  I have not only lost every game - I have finished last every game!  Maybe I would score it higher if I could figure it out.  Hmmmm.  Good game nonetheless.

A beautifully illustrated game in which players assume the roles of pirates vying for the most booty (points) over the course of twelve "months" (turns). Lots of player interaction with just enough randomness to keep things interesting and with just enough choices to give players lots of potential strategies. 

A gift from Ben Hardy.

Recommended with 3-5 players (best 5). 60-90 mins.

RATING: 5
A well integrated theme in a decent game. Fighting other pirates (players or legendary) is certainly a fun part of the game but isn't necessarily key to winning the game. There are a couple avenues to victory and the choices for getting there can be subtle but important. Still, the game does seem to follow predictable patterns depending on who you are playing with. If players like conflict then expect a lot of fighting. If players don't then expect a lot of avoiding everyone's ships. Both of these paths can get boring quickly!

The dice can really hurt you, and the "6 dice on all attacks" parrot is ridiculous.

Now that THAT'S out of the way, this is a pretty fun game.  The rulebook was very pretty, and full of theme, but at times that *almost* got in the way.  Once you figure out how to play, though, it's definitely fun.  Don't expect too many major agonizing decisions, let the dice fly, and have fun.

RATING: 6
This is really more like a 6.5 I think, it's fun to build the ship up and the tension of trying to out think your opponents when deciding where to sail is nice, but combat is a bit lackluster and the tempo loss from a major combat loss pretty much precludes you from winning, rending the game a long slog for the guy in last place. Still, fun over some drinks if you aren't taking it too seriously

This is so much better than the other pirate game I have. There is a lot going on with this game and it might be best taught by going through a sample turn instead of trying to explain all the rules. An extra turn summary sheet or two would also help keep things moving for people unfamiliar with the game. My only complaint is that it does have a fair amount of luck involved with the dice rolling in combat but, there are plenty of other ways to strategize.

As per recommendations here on BGG, I bought Pirates of Spanish Main ships.  Played this a few times with the family and it was throughly enjoyed.  Looked nice with the PoSM ships.  The only thing that bothered us all is that the game seems to end when it started getting fun.  To remedy this, we re-shuffled half of the deck again.

Gave this away as a Christmas present for my nephew who enjoyed the game.

fantastic production quality.  the base game is too non-confrontational for my tastes.  i know variants exist, but i'd hope for something more official.  i've only played it once, and it's been over a year.  i don't think it's going to see the light of day outside of my regular groups, and i don't really feel motivated to read the rules again or teach it.  i would still like to play it again sometime.  but when i actually think about it, i'm put off enough by the lack of confrontation.  i've traded my copy, but i'm curious to see if their oft-rumored expansion can breathe a little life into it if it ever gets released.

This game was fairly frustrating.  The cards are way out of balance, and they're quite unclear.  The entire game is too random, and it's too easy to fall way behind when people constantly attack your weakest section.  Our first game constantly had us referring back to the rules...it would have been nice to have a turn order sheet for everyone.  The components are mostly very nice, and the game is somewhat fun.  The randomness just makes it a maddening experience.

Small toy pirate ships instead of the paper cards you use would take this game to a higher level. (Any suggestions out there?  Update: The Melissa and Doug 3D Puzzle Pirate Ship!)

Despite first impressions, this seems to be an adults game.  I've tried with an 8 year old with minimal luck, and I've heard similar reports with playing with an 11 year old.  I enjoy playing this with people who don't normally play boardgames.

My favorite game accessory is a former roommate who was captured by pirates when he was young.  Though he's no longer my roommate, and I've never played this game with him, I'm sure glad he's around.

My 2nd favorite accessory for this game is some sunken treasure which has been recovered from the sea, silver coins handed down to me from my uncle.

I found this game to be a bit frustrating.  The theme is great, and the combat seemed solid to me in theory.  In practice, however, I found the combat to be rather pointless.  The rewards are too small to be worth it, as even a win beats you up to the point where you will get smoked in your next battle.  I think the winning player will usually be the one who avoids combat the most, which is somewhat contrary to the theme.

After a few more plays, I find that the game has too much luck involved for my liking.  Add to that too many rules that are unclear and the ability to get set so far back just because someone else decided to go to the same place you did makes it feel like a complicated version of craps.  Try once with a player experienced at the game, but don't expect to have a lot of fun.

Frothy fun.

Blind movement game. Beautiful production, astounding really. Might be a good family game but I'm too much of a strategist to enjoy this. If you manage to avoid battles, you have a much greater chance of winning, which seems a bit antithematic to the pirate theme.

Really a crowd pleaser this one. Our group has very tight games, is light enough for a Friday night after a long week of work or as a gateway game.

Beautiful and very funny. We use it as a break-game between "harder" games like El Grande etc. We play without Long John's Silver parrot because it gives a great advantage to one of the players, especially at the beginning of the game. Very random-with bad luck you can have a best ship and still loose the fight, but with good attitude it gives a lot of fun

Pirate's Cove is much to chaotic for my taste. You get hit two times in the first rounds and are thus forced to sail to one specific island make your ship seaworthy again. When at least one other player is interested in this island as well, you've probably lost another turn. As the game lasts only twelve turns, you are having serious problems whe such a situation unfolds.

The parrots in the DoW version have a tremendous impact, thus enhancing the luck factor.

It's quite a nice game to play with children, but at our regular gaming sessions it will hardly see the light of the lamp more than once per year.

Just played this earlier today... this game was a refreshing mix of resource management, combat, and improvement.  The numerous special cards add a lot to the strategy, and the the combat with blackbeard as well as the royal navy keeps things livening.  Player combat is also handled quite well.  Finally, it seems to capture the feeling of being a pirate quite well.

[i]Posted: 2/4/06, Rated: 7[/i]

On the surface, [i]Pirate's Cove[/i] is a fine looking ship.  Unfortunately, she's taking on water faster than her bilge pumps can bail out.

Production values abound in this swashbuckling game.  I really like the idea of improving the various sections of the ship, and balancing your "resources" such as money, treasure, fame points, and Tavern Cards.  There is a definite undercurrent of [i][thing=3076]Puerto Rico[/thing][/i] in which the earlier part of the game should be spent maximizing money, and then there is a shift to [-]Victory Points[/-] Fame Points toward the end.

Then Combat rears its ugly head.  Initiative is determined, and the attacking player rolls a number of dice set by her ship's characteristics.  At this point, the game devolves to [i][thing=2243]Yahtzee[/thing][/i], or [i][thing=8689]Bunco[/thing][/i].  All of that early money that you pumped into your ship can be quickly undone by a lucky roll of the dice.  You don't even get a chance to defend like you can in [i][thing=181]Risk[/thing][/i].

As a result, players' moves are often telegraphed.  Lose all of your crew points?  You'll be headed to Crew Island, Matey.  Take a big hit to your hull?  Then it's off to Hull Island for you!  Unless a lucrative Treasure Card is waiting on Hull Island, in which case you may have to slink away to some other location while a healthier ship plunders it.

The game ends up feeling very scripted, without a lot of real choices.  Ganging up on the leader is easy enough to do.  It is fun to take two or more damaged ships and defeat a healthy one.  Table talk makes this kind of coordination easy, and my group is considering disallowing any -- other than the obligatory cries of "Scallywag!" as battle is enjoined.

Theme counts for something, and in this case it counts for a full point added to an otherwise middling score of "6."  [i]Pirate's Cove[/i] may have a fresh coat of paint, but any semblance of long-term strategy has been pillaged from it.

[i]Updated: 7/13/10, Rated: 6[/i]

With the advent of other, more enjoyable pirate-themed games (Ahoy, [i][thing=28023]Jamaica[/thing][/i]!), [i]Pirate's Cove[/i] is no longer compelling.  The play is a "5" at best, but I'll still give it an extra point for its lavish production values.

Piratenbucht is a really fun and interesting game. There is a large luck factor in combat but also strategy when upgrading your ship and playing action and combat cards. The only bad thing I can think of is that the underdogs tend to get picked on more than others. All in all a fun game.

Pirates, ARRRRGGG!! I love the Days of Wonder big box games, and this one is no exception. It has beautiful components. My only real gripe with Pirate's Cove is the combat system.

Light game with pirate theme. Players will blind bid the island destination looking for money, treasure, cards and ship improvement. If another player is where you're arrived, fighting starts and the loser will be sent to his cove to repair.
Repeat 12 rounds, and the guy with most treasure/money dug will win.
Game quality is very good. Reccomended for pirate lovers and for guys loving randomness in their games.

A fun little game, but I don't know how much replay value is here with too much weighing on whether or not one can consistently avoid conflict and draw quality cards.  Also it seems its actually better to never fight the pirates lest you open yourself up to meddling from other players and potentially weakening yourself in future conflicts.  Could be a decent gateway game, though.

I must confess in advance that I'm not a big pirate fan. It's a theme that doesn't do much for me. However, Days of Wonder usually makes games that suit my game taste, so I wanted to give this game a shot. Our big dilemma when playing this game was the rulebook. It was either extremely hard to find information, or there was information not even included. Our constant flipping through the rules made the game feel more complex than it should have been. The battles needed to be quick and exciting, but they ended up slow and frustrating. I was also frustrated that the game just felt anticlimactic. Since there is very little endgame scoring, the winner can be decided before the last round is even played. I also didn't like how one rough battle could basically cripple a player for the rest of the game. The pirate's cove location was clearly intended as a consolation prize for battle losers, but the benefit is so minimal and the player is already knocked down so badly from battle. Now they did design the game so someone who can't win battles can still win the game by avoiding battle and just grabbing points from then on, but since the location selection is all hidden there's no way to guarantee that you won't fight. I want to give this game another chance because there might be something worthwhile in there, but I'll need a long re-read of the rules and extensive research in the rules forums on BGG.  Just not sure the game is worth that kind of time and effort.

I love the theme and the components are well done, but ultimately this game is too luck based with too few interesting choices. I am not fond of guessing what my oponent is guessing I am going to do, and this game has a fair amount of that as you are choosing which island to go to. Also, avoiding combat seems to be a wise course, and it would be nice if the pirates were more encouraged to blast each other to bits. Still, if you talk like a pirate you might have a good time (although if you are like me you will finish the game with a sore throat).

You don’t have to expect anything more than a good hour of light-hearted fun and laughter when approaching the Pirate’s Cove: interaction among the players is constantly at its highest and actually it’s the real fuel of the game, as almost all the fun comes from sharing cannonades with the other freebooters and looting as much as you can before the other players do the same.

It’s not difficult to trust those who say this is one of the best pirate-themed games around. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to keep half-point ratings to a minimum: however fun, Pirate’s Cove still isn’t one of them, hence I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6 until I'll have another chance at playing it.

(Pirate's Cove) This is a game that I can get both my family and my gamer friends to play together. Game mechanics are easy enough for family play and just complex enough for gamers to enjoy once in a while. Artwork is nice and quality of bits is high. Primary down side is there is a significant luck factor. I played a game recently where I pulled ahead in a 5-player game and was first place at the midpoint, then didn't earn a single point for the rest of the game and ended up last.

Pretty pieces. Look at all the pretty pieces. Little ships, wheee!

Requires talking like a pirate to really get into it. Can't play it too often, though, it becomes monotonous.

I like the status tracks and how each one impacts the game slightly differently.  Sails seems to be the least valuable improvement, but of course too low of any status makes easy pickings during combat.  I like that you can try to choose low-risk options and slowly gain score, but if another player is playing equally risk avert you are probably just giving the game away to the aggressive players since they will be less contested.  I dislike that many of the tavern cards have rules ambiguities that are not clarified in the rulebook.  Two big signs of Ameritrash: lots of ambiguous cards, cards that are MUCH MUCH better than others, and rolling dice for combat.  I'm not a big fan of this game.  At least it ends relatively quickly!

Pirate Captains ply the islands in their ships trying to outhink and outfight their rivals while collecting treasure. Think "Fire and Axe" only with pirates instead of Vikings, and just as random. Very pretty!

Good beer & pretzels dice fest. The simultaneous move mechanic is a cute (if derivative) idea and puts you in mind of Citadels as a game of mind-reading and double-thinking. In the end, you all do pretty much the same things and hope to be luckier at it than the rest.

With the right group this game rocks!! Played it with my niblings and we were all on our feet shouting and having a great time by the end of the game. By way of comparison, when played with my adult group, everyone was bored and ribbed me for suggesting it, Assholes! This one's a keeper  but will probably collect a bit of dust waiting for that "right group" opportunity.

The dice make it a bit of a luck fest as a few losses in combat can really hurt a player.  The tension between other ships and the black ship(s) is nice.  The secret selection actually works better than I thought it would.

I really enjoy this game and wish I could play it more. Well that's true for most of my games, but I am a lover of all things pirate-y and really enjoy the mechanics and the theme of this game. It's tough because it's primarily a 3 player or more game and if i'm in that wheelhouse then i'm more likely to try to get 7 wonders or smallworld to the table. With that said, I like the simplicity of the game, the fun, the screw you element and quite frankly the little bit of strategy that sits underneath it all. Solid game...I think i'm probably a fan of Days of Wonder games.

RATING: N/A
Ahoy, matey!  I'm sad that this game is so dependent on luck and dice rolling.  I'm a sucker for a good pirate theme!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme helps to make this work, but the hidden movement of the player's ships makes for some random outcomes for battle. One really can't bail out to avoid combat too often, as opportunities to gain treasures/fame points are lost. On the other hand, battling every turn will cause the ship to be constantly in need of repair, and get the player behind. Dice are used to resolve battles, but you will enjoy knocking off other pirates - and especially Blackbeard for the big points. Fun game if you are not expecting too much analysis. UPDATE: Reducing a point because of lack of interest - over a year since we last played. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This rating applies to 3 adult players. The equipment is good, the theme is excellent, the strategy and tactics are weak, the luck is signficant. This is not a game that I really feel like going back to. I feel that more players would make it better. At 3, there is not quite enough contention I think.

For younger children 7-12, on the other hand, it is a solid 8 due to the very strong theme and the fun of the treasure and battles.

I seem to be the only one of my gaming friends who thinks this is a good game. Its colorful, fun , solid components and captures being a pirate and the associated theme very well. Sure it has large amounts of lucks but that's what it was like being a pirate and therefore pirate games have luck.

RATING: 6
fun game ! Having the non-player Pirates doing such a predictable circuit was a bit wierd tho ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An occasionally very random game of trying to avoid fights as much as anything else, Pirate's Cove is a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult for a player to come back from an early sinking in battle.  Little house rules like random famous pirate movement make the game a bit more challenging and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun, relatively light game. Most of the strategy lies in time management, i.e., deciding how to best optimize the time you have to upgrading your ship, finding treasures, picking battles, burying treasure, and (all to the ultimate end of) gaining fame. The biggest problem I have with it is that so much is luck-based in the battles. I'm not a fan of such a degree of luck figuring into a game, and my husband positively abhors it, so I think I'm a lot less favorably inclined to this game since I usually have to listen to him complain. The upshot of this is that our three-person games turned into mind games of "I think that person is looking at cannon island... they must be going to cannon island, so I'll go somewhere else..." just to avoid battles. Obviously, you can't avoid battles with a larger number of players.  Best played with people who aren't going to get really upset when the dice go against them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Only played a few times. Simple game with a simultaneous blind selection of the various locations (and hence treasure) each turn. If two players end up in the same location they have to fight really brutal combat. Fun, but it seemed to be lacking depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This was the hit of our night with an easy-to-learn game and a cool theme. I had a sizable lead in "Fame" points and a nicely-upgraded ship when the "Dice Gods" screwed me with some very low numbers during battle. I was crippled by the weakest pirate and my wife blasted me with a card that took half my round's Fame. She passed me at the end for World's Greatest Pirate. Goes into our Couples Game Night rotation for sure.

A fun game that you want to control but you can't! The simultaneous action aspect of the game will frustrate you or delight you depending on what other people do. If you want to spend a good hour and a half second guessing yourself and regretting your decisions, this is the game for you! I enjoy this game, but it's lack of controlability and strategy keep it down on my list of favorites.

I like pirate-themed games and I really like the general idea behind this one, especially the way it makes you weigh the pros of gaining treasure vs. the cons of losing in a sea fight. The secret island selection process is cool, as are the relatively simple combat rules.

I just wish the game's theme weren't so watered down. Here, pirates don't kill or sink each other, they just "damage" the other ship and require the loser to go to the shop for repairs. What?! Seriously?! 

These are pirates!!! There should be blood and guts, ribaldry and drunkenness, ruthlessness and betrayal. Even the artwork makes it obvious that this is a little kid's game: the cartoon figures look like they're from Chutes and Ladders. Alas, someday my dream pirate game will come out...

RATING: 3
Beautiful game.  I hate the dice combat system, but I guess that's the way the game is.  I'm torn, because it was kinda fun to play, but it's not really a  great game.  It seems the best strategy is to avoid battle and work on your hull.

Pirate's Cove Edition - Gorgeous components.  Good combination of second guessing your opponents, strategically building up the strength of your ship, and blasting the heck out of each other!  Can be fun on occasion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
11/9/10 - This one always seems to be welcome at the game table. While isn't not the most exciting game in the world, we always seem to have good fun with it. The key to making this game work is to use the "Parley" variant rules listed in the Pirate's Cove forums. It helps control a runaway leader, and makes combat a little more viable.

2/27/16 - Decided to add a 1-minute sand timer for parley, to keep negotiations from bogging down the game. Anyone can start the sand timer at any moment, whether they're involved in parley or not. If no agreement is reached by the end, then battle must occur.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Awesome components and a fun Pirates theme on a decent, but not good game.  There are tiny bits of strategy and tactics, but the luck (dice and card draws) rules everything.  You can try to play the probabilities, of course, but with so few turns in the game, there is not really time for luck to even out.  Losing battles can really set you back while the winners get a huge advantage.  Fun, with limitations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well, I played 4-player, had a bad run of dice luck and lost an early battle, then I won one, then I lost again.  With a severely weakened ship, and unfortunate luck in choosing islands (no matter how much I tried to avoid people), I spent the last SEVEN (of twelve) turns in Pirate's Cove.  In spite of this, I can see where it would be a fun game, and would happily play it again.  Played again, won, and liked it less than I did when I was fileted.  This is a dicefest, fun, but not worth more than 5 or so plays.

RATING: 8.5
Just an all around fun game to play with the whole family. I recently introduced this to a family who doesn't game all that much. It was me, the Mom & Dad and two other younger kids (I think 9 and 7). We all had a blast and they went on to purchase the game afterward.

A "10" minus 3 for randomness.  Awesome game, but the developers should have fixed balance issues before publishing.  The combat is random but avoidable and little consequence for losing.  

The cards are horrendously imbalanced.  For example there is a unique card that allows you to hold UNLIMITED treasure chests and give you extra hitpoins to your ship.  Your ship start with capacity of 5 and can be improved to 12.  Each treasure chest can be potentially 1 victory point each.

This game can be a lot fun if you like pirates. I have to be in the right move because this is sort of a roll and move game without the rolling.

A beautiful game and the mechanics are fun. Can play it anytime. However I altered the game a little so that players can attack each other, you can enter a rival's ship, you can own a second ship and if you, as captain, run away too much or lose, your crew will mutiny and leave you stranded on a deserted island ;-) Harrrrrr    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Harrrrr. Seems to end too soon - would make a good filler game as is, but we want it to be more. Our game group typically extends the game by playing through a reshuffle of treasure cards, effectively doubling the basic game length. 

We use replica Spanish coins (Reales, Escudos, Dubloons, Pieces of Eight..) instead of the whimpy little 1's and 5's markers. The weight and sound of the coins adds SOOO much to the game. The coins are also used in a variety of other games we play.

Rated 7 after one play. This is silly fun. You can do some planning and try to predict where other people are moving, but between the simultaneous action and dice-rolling combat, a win will always need a bit of luck. I enjoyed my first play. I'm curious if this game gets better or worse with multiple plays.

This game is in a bit of a tough spot: too much luck for "serious" gamers, too many rules and exceptions for non-gamers. If played briskly, this can be a light-hearted diversion for gamers that still like fun in their games.

RATING: 3
A game I would love to love.  It looked cool, but my first hint at how bad it would play was seen with the ill-written rules.  The board is nice, but deceptive (you don't acctually "move" the ships).  The items ruled the game and made it a tad silly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game with a well-executed pirate theme. The board and components are beautiful, and there are various strategies to pursue while also building your pirate ship in whatever way you choose to accent your chose strategy. 
Despite the game having a decent amount of depth, it also moves fairly quickly and doesn't last too long. The only problem I can think of besides a small luck component in some dice is that the card "Long John Silver's Parrot" seems pretty broken. But if you find yourself coming to the same conclusion, you could always "nerf" the card with some house rules as you deem it appropriate.

Superb game!! Wonderful game mechanism, pretty easy to learn, filled with excitement and with lots of thinking in it - especially "Hmm I bet my opponents are going there to do this and that, so I’ll just avoid them all by going here and do that... or maybe that’s what they’re expecting of me to do - hence I should go there instead... or that’s their _real_ plan and thus I should _really_ be going there to do this instead" and in the end you still end up being wrong and everyone goes "Oh bloody hell, why did you have to go there for?! I though you were going there to do that instead!!" ^_^

It doesn't get much better than this, man am I glad to have stumbled upon this game or what!

This game is FUN.  No, its not a deep masterpiece...but the combination of very nice components and theme make for a great gaming experience. We are often all laughing outloud during play.  Is it a "gamers game?" Probably not. But if you enjoy something a little lighter, don't mind 90 minute play-time, and groove on theme....then this game deserves a place in your closet (and on your table).  I would recommend this as an excellent introductory game for casual players/nongamers.

Great bits and good theme but some of the mechanics just don't fit for me. Avoiding combat is crappy. Also, too long for what it is.

RATING: 3
I love the theme on this, and previously rated it higher because of it, but I had to drop it back down to more accurately reflect what I think of the mechanics themselves, which are what ultimately determine how often I'm going to play a game. Extremely light, would be good to play with non-gamers, but nothing that would be appropriate for heavy play. The central issue I have is the random selection of islands mechanism, I have a strong dislike for double (triple, quintuple...) blind solutions to *anything* in games and in this one it's critical as the person who guesses correctly as to where the other players aren't going to go enough times and early enough in the game will be at a huge advantage for the mid and late game. The game also plays overly long for what it is IMHO. Before I'd played German games I probably would have rated this as one of my favourites, but the lack of choices and the nature of the combats (guess your way into them, luck your way through them) give this game a black eye for me.

It's hard not to get into the pirate theme and all the great components, but the game pasted on to the theme and rules is frankly pretty boring.  The best strategy is clear (avoid fighting other players at all costs and you'll win the game)but somehow it's still fun to play from time to time and it's easy to rope just about anyone into it on looks alone.  Plunder is ultimately a better, more serious treatment of the theme but the components here blow it away.  Pretty vacant?

This game was a lot of fun when I was first getting back into games. It is fairly quick and it can be a dice rolling extravaganza!! I find that I got sick of it pretty quickly, however. There just isn't that much strategy, and NOT getting in fights tends to work out better. Not as fun though. A very good game to get non-gamers to play, but wouldn't often be my choice of game in any other circumstance. After playing so many other games, I find myself wanting to play this even less. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is not bad at all. The cartoony look is amusing, the duration feels right and the game material is flawless.
But I found it to be repetitive, prone to the poorest-gets-poorer syndrome, very random and ultimately too light for my taste.
The only mechanic in this game is simultaneous choice of move. This becomes rather tedious after a (short) while.
Ended up trading it.

RATING: 6
Fun game, though it felt a bit fiddly for my taste.  Went the non-confrontational route during my first game (which doesn't really feel like it's in the spirit of the game!) and scored pretty decently.  Need more plays.

Downgrading to a 6.  With so many other great games out there, I just don't feel the need to revisit this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
Another game my wife loves, and about as deep into some RPG building elements as she will get.  NPC rules are so broken because we quickly found that people just avoid the ships, so house rule is after you chose your destination, roll D6 to see where they end up.  Adds more randomness but they should surprise you although if you get too unlucky you get so far behind and can't catch up.  Still a great lighter game I can't wait until my kids are old enough to play!

Beautiful game that's really got something missing from it. I've played three times, and it just doesn't grab me. It feels somewhat anticlimatic, since there's no in-game reason for the game's end...it's just over after twelve turns. The parrots feel very unbalancing, which is only moderated by the Risk-like effect of the dice; I won the second game in part because an opponent firing six guns missed with every one.

A board and components this nice deserve a better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Despite a few strange rules and the bizarre loss/loss situation of battles, this is a fun and exciting game.  I haven't seen a battle between ships where all the players at the table are watching and focused on the fight, even if they aren't actually in it themselves.  The light ruleset makes it easy to teach to newbies as well!

I really like this game, even though I often end up battered and bruised at Pirate's Cove (I never want to see triple 6s again).  I play this to theme, and never back down from a fight.

I think the only variant that I might try is to have the pirates show up randomly at islands.

[b]Board Game Revolution - ~2008[/b] 
Pretty simple mechanic: travel to islands, collect resources, upgrade ships, and bury treasure.  Love the helm where you secretly choose which island you want to go to without know where the other players want to go.  The rules say to reveal your helm's choice on the count of three; we choose to say, "Yo ho ho" revealing our choice on the last "ho".

Only downside would be fighting each other kicks a player out from upgrading their ship.  Sometimes this leads to a single player dominating the board while debilitating the others each turn.  This is where "reading" the other players ships are important...so you do not get into conflict with them.  The dice battles are awesome, by the way!

Also, the legendary pirates are nice to battle, but can add more player vs. player conflicts, which we do not like as much.

Pirate's Cove is a fairly fun game that plays in a couple of hours.  This is a euro style game.  Teenagers and non-gamers will probably like this game. Each player runs a pirate ship.  There tends to be combat in this game with lots of dice rolling as the canons roar.  There is also tactical movement on the game board.  Pillaging and gaining treasure are present as well.  Will you gain the fame of becoming the most highly regarded pirate?  Again, this game is simplistic to initial play, but also can become fairly competitive as players learn the ins and outs and subtleties of game play.

It's got just enough rules problems to make them an annoyance. If I played this monthly, it would be no problem, but since I only play it once or twice a year, it's frustrating to have to look up rules and to struggle to remember corrections that have been noted here on the Geek. It would be an okay game if I had a perfect memory or if someone else owned it and could rattle off my rules questions as they came up each game.

EDIT: After more playings, I just don't see enough fun in this game. Others seem to like it, but I cannot get into it more than once every year or two and then for only about a quarter of the game.

The setting your movement and hoping not to run into anyone else or trying to run in to someone else to beat them up can be alot of fun but the combat takes to long and if you keep getting smashed early then catch up can become impossible. Also the game can go on for far to long especially at the higher player counts.

This one didn't quite click for me like I had hoped. Sometimes I just get a feeling when I play a game and know it's good... didn't get that here.

Great components as expected from Days of Wonder. Too much dice rolling and luck for this particular game. There isn't much balance in the game at all.

This game is a fun one for the theme alone.  There is quite a bit of randomness in the dice rolling-combat.  Card play allows for screwage of your opponents.  Combat takes a little too much time with all the rolling, but overall, the game isn't too long, as the mechanism only allows for 12 rounds.  Great fun to be able to take your treasure and bury it for victory points!

There are much better games with a pirate theme other than this.

THis game has a really good pirate flavor to it.  It is relatively simple once you start playing (although the royal navy card seems to cause confusion, even after reading the FAQ).

Shallow game, not funny. 
Family double-guessing, dice rolling game, rich in theme but somehow lacking in gameplay.

A dicefest, so don't pretend to apply any strategy. Be prepared to be foiled by a roll of five 6!!!!

In the double-guessing genre, I'd rather play Hoity Toity or Edel, Stein and Reich, in the fighting/dice rolling category, I'd rather play Clash of the Gladiators. As a pirate-themed game, it is surpassed by Rum & Pirates.

A good and easy to learn game. it's the kind a game you can play with young kids or with you're buddies during a party. I like the secrecy of the naval action because it offers the opportunity to bluff the other pirates. Also, the theme is so cool. Possibilities of future expansion too.

RATING: 7
Great art, nice integration of theme with rules and some good mechanics.  There are maybe just one or two too many layers to the rules or steps to the process, and having to check the manual constantly to understand what the cards do is annoying.  Some big, obvious things that should have been caught in play-testing (like sequence of when exactly certain things get played, or what happens if... stuff) aren't in the manual.  Would also be nice if there were a simple phase-tracking device to make sure you don't get things out of order.  But it's hard to hate a pirate game that gets so much right.

RATING: 3
My group loves it. I'm a LOT more iffy. To me it has a lot of serious problems, chief among them is that there's just not that many meaningful decisions to be made. There's also a heavy beat up on the weak player effect.

I actually played a game were I had a battle on the first turn and then did NOTHING but sail from island to island for the rest of the game (and not on purpose). This one honestly gets worse with each successive play.

Overly complicated (some confusing rules in there) for what it is and frankly I can't recommend it at all.

Beautiful bits though.

RATING: 7.6
Pirate'e Cove is my favourite pirate game (until Merchants and Marauders comes out).  It is fairly simple, with a 'we all play at the same time' feel to it.  Lots of dice throwing when combat comes around.  It just provides a great themey romp that is fun and good for all ages.
*Now that Merchants and Marauders has come out, it has become my favourite pirate game.  But, I will keep this in my collection as it is really fun, fits the theme and is a great entry game.
*March 2012: Now that I have played M&M ALOT (15+ plays), I think that Pirates Cove is my go to Pirate game with new gamers.  M&M bogs down quickly when you have more than one person learning the game.  HOWEVER Merchants & Marauders is still MY favourite pirate game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty decent game with lots of theme for a German title.  Take shots to the hull, sail, crew, or cannons.  Send out the royal navy to take on the other pirates.  Flee too soon from a battle and your crew may mutiny.  The blind selection of islands adds too much luck/bluff, but it can still be fun to play.  It runs a little long.  The cards throw in some twists which require "lookups" in the rule book.  Too chaotic to rate much higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to learn and fun for the entire family. this allows player combat that is fun and innovative and is not extremely complicated. this is a game that people that do not like fighting with other players might enjoy as the combat element is light and fun for all and will not destroy your chances to be a competitor.

RATING: 6
Pirate's Cove edition.  Colourful pirate game.  Players secretly navigate to one of six islands, to interact and plunder there.  Four of the islands allow upgrades for their ship to be purchased, one allows powerful event cards to be purchased, and the sixth is where you bury your loot for victory points.  The crux of the game is combat, which occurs when pirates bump into each other at an island.  A fun, die rolling, "romp" type game - not for those looking for a historical treatment on the golden age of Piracy!  Glorious bits.

Waiting in vain for an International or English edition. Huge untapped market leads me to hope that some entreprenuer will get a clue, do the math, and publish a new edition... scores on fun factor over elegance.

I normally don't like dice rollers much, but this one was very enjoyable. Great interaction and just a lot of fun. It pulls you in, but then again...it's pirates (hard NOT to have fun when pirates are involved). It went on a little long for my taste, and I think the VP cards are overpowered (especially considering you probably got them by retreating or losing a battle). With some house rules and perhaps a smaller number of rounds, I think this would be much better.

There's a lot of things going on at once with this game, but they're all manageable, and I enjoy this game very much.

UPDATE Nov 2014: I just played this game for the first time in 8 years, and I have to say I think it's been replaced in nearly every way (thematically, mechanistically) by Jamaica.   One player will probably get knocked out of a game of Pirate's Cove very early on, and that may be frustrating for them.  However, my kids liked it, and it still looks great,

UPDATE Jan 2016: I don't like this game.  I don't enjoy the battles, win or lose.  It is no fun to lose a turn or to make others lose their turns.

While the structure of the game is set up to appeal to "strategy gamers," the role of dice is so pronounced, and the luck factor so high, as to be a total mismatch with that underlying structure. The end result should prove unsatisfying to most "strategists" and too intricate for most "casual gamers," no matter how beautiful the production values.

Of my group, I liked this game the least.  Not only because I picked poorly the first few turns and kept ending up in conflicts/crippled and never recovered.  Where's the strategy?  Just roll dice for a while.  Still, it's pretty and contains decent levels of theme.

UPDATE (a decade later): Rating lowered from 5 to 3 after having played with the family. I just don't like this game. My family didn't like this game. Hate the dice. Hate the fact that losing a fight early means you're essentially 2 turns behind everyone else (and probably broke). Hate that there's no real way to avoid getting in fights. Hate the overpowered cards that take what little strategy there is and throws it out the window. It is pretty. Too bad it's not a better (i.e., more strategic) experience.

Another one that my kids like, but I don't. Too easy to lose your first battle based on a roll of the dice and to never be able to catch back up after that. Most of the black ship pirates are so ridiculously difficult to kill that you really don't stand much of a chance to beat them until the end of the game (maybe) and if you're that strong, then you've probably got the game already won anyway.

My 2 Home-made Pirates at http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/343626.

Tough call on the rating. Initially feels like an 8, but the game can slow down in the middle (6 rating), the flavor and battles with the legendary pirates (using house rule random movement)bring it back to a 7.Best with 4 people. 2 player variant is too hard to manage, 3 players is not enough, 5 is too much :)   I recommend playing with a house rule that has random pirate movement after the players have all moved.

I always lose at this game. Last game played got 12 fights in 12 turns. What a pain!

Theme is enjoyable. Beautiful game. Random, dicefest, luck, cards. Light. Enjoyable for non-gamers.

If you lose a fight, it can cost a lot to get to the same level as the other players. So, you probably fight more often since you are an easier prey than another player. Random choosing of the island you go to could be better. Your lucky if you end up alone. In a lot of cases, you could have two oppenents to fight in the same turn.

Rated 7 down to a 6. Still enjoyable theme, but too much randomness to my liking.

I like this game. A lot. Except for the dice rolling, (because I suck at it.) Takes a play through to get a grip on all the cards. So far, the final round has been nothing more than a run to treasure island. It's easy (and less interesting) to avoid a lot of conflict, especially with 3. Will see how it goes with more plays and a different group.

The pirate game I was looking for, but quite simple. Simultaneous decisions with some cards to add flexibility to your strategy. The round structure ensures it does not overstay its welcome. It can be hard to stop a leader unless a few people are willing to gang up on them, and managing the various upgrades can be difficult at times.

RATING: 7
This game's strongest asset is that it's dripping with atmosphere and has beautiful components.  But don't take the game itself too seriously.  The simultaneous movement mechanic means there's a fair amount of chaos and not a lot of deliberate strategic control.  There are also elements of the game that are hugely imbalanced - for instance: anyone with the hull parrot is almost guaranteed to win, unless they get very unlucky; or if someone's ship gets crippled early, it's almost impossible to get back in the game in a meaningful way, especially if you keep running into opposing ships every turn.  That said, the game is still lots of fun to play.  The combat system is simple and effective, and it's fun to try to outguess your opponent's navigation plans.  Just don't expect this to be a "pirate simulation".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There is a lot of chrome, but the game seems largely to hinge on whether you run into another player at the island you choose to sail to, with the less you run into other players the more likely you are to win.  12 turns isn't long enough to allow the luck involved to balance out.  For me the game is too long for something that relies on such a mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I really wanted to like this game. Great theme, great bits. Way too luck based. Someone wrote that they thought if you made all your decisions completely randomly in this game, you probably wouldn't do any better than if you thought really hard about any sort of strategy.

O jogo está muito bem concebido. As ilustrações são muito boas. O factor sorte do jogo não é elevado, acontece apenas com a recolha das cartas e nas batalhas (com os dados), contudo penso que está proporcional, nada de exagerado. Este jogo requer muita atenção com a configuração do nosso barco para nos defendermos de possíveis ataques. Temos de saber escolher muito bem a ilha para onde queremos navegar. O livro de regras é um pouco longo, mas depois de uma primeira leitura, ficamos a perceber todo o mecanismo do jogo. È um jogo muito divertido e não damos pelo tempo a passar quando estamos a jogar o jogo. Recomendo-o a todos aqueles que gostam de jogos de estratégia e de piratas.

There is an element to this game that I disklike.  That is, if you lose the first battle, the odds are, you are now fighting to not be last.  Once you have lost a fight, you are easy prey for others and will be preyed upon.  There are ways to build up your ship, but in doing so, you are going to be knocked out of the game due to eveyone being able to pound your wounded boat to smithereens.  I've played the game 5 times.

Prefer playing with 3 (rather than 4 or 5) because with more the game devolves to a dice game. Although there are some treasure cards that can help and facilitate a bit of strategy, it's a different game.  There are already plenty of combats with 3 players and the stock pirates.  
It's fun to try and outguess or bluff your way to the best islands to maximize benefits and convert those to points.
Building up strength can be costly vs just going for treasures and VPs, and taking the periodic combat hits. 
[Used Mayday 43 x 65 sleeves which fit perfectly.  The FF sleeves had overhang at the top and meant the cards didn't fit into the box insert.)

Played the game 4 times and my impressions are still very positive. I like the theme, the components, the "wargame" element (you actually get to attack your opponents) and the turn angst (you always need more than you have, and more than you can get). There is an element of guessing/bluff that is interesting as well. 
  The closest to a negative I see is that a couple of cards might be a bit too strong - but I am not convinced that is true. There are probably ways around them. Six Gun Salute probably takes some team-work to knock it out. I also have problems with the Slight of Hand card that allows a player to select any card from the discards. However, repeated playings may show ways around these problems. For the present, I love the game and think there is a good balance of strategy and chance. I definitely plan to get the English edition as soon as released.

Great for kids and non-gamers, great bits, all round good.

RATING: 4
Note: this is my 500th game rated. ;p)

I can play some games as a light and fun romp whereas some fall into the category of, “Can’t we just have a conversation instead?” Pirates Cove falls into the latter. Among equally skilled players (which happens after half a play), it comes down to who benefits from the luck and player chaos better. I’m OK with the dice rolling as there’s enough of it to even out, but the bonus cards are so unequal as to fall into the ridiculous category. It sure is “smart” to get a parrot and master craftsman with your first two cards, innit? Why doesn’t everyone just do that? And it’s too short of a game to build back up after a setback, so whoever gets the most wind behind their sails with the right cards and dice rolls will battle it out for first. The other players will fight for last. 

Here’s your Pirates Cove strategy guide:

1.	Get good cards, especially a parrot (bonus power) early on in the game
2.	Bury the treasure you’ve collected when you have 6 so you’re not a target for the Consort card
3.	When selecting a destination, don’t look at the revealed cards as much as the other players’ boards to see what they need and where they are most likely headed. Go somewhere else!
4.	Buff your ship up by the end so you can take out one of the dreaded pirates either by yourself or with someone
5.      Always keep 2 coins so when you get knocked out you can buy 2 cards to fish the deck for good stuff. Then repair yourself with your coins.

BTW, we play with a house rule. If your ship was sent to pirates cove last round, everyone else reveals their navigation location before you have to pick an island. This prevents a ship from being pounded repeatedly. Without this house rule, I rate Pirate's Cove a 2.

OK, I admit I may have overrated this game, but it is so much fun to play!  Arrrrrrrr!!!  The production from Days of Wonder is top notch and there's plenty of interaction.  Low on strategy but super high on fun.

Played 5+ times. Enjoying this game tremendously, but I wonder if the replay value is good. Good with 4 and 5 players so far. Lots of luck, but lots of fun. Remember, this is a DICE game, despite all the cool trappings. Outfit sections of your ship by visiting the corresponding islands, picming up treasure and such along the way. The only major flaw in this game may be the lack of the draw with the Tavern cards, since they can vary wildly in value to the player. Still, a lot of fun.

So much fun for a dicefest!  I usually bicker when there is too much dicerolling involved but not in this case.  The trick is trying to guess where the opponents will end up and then to blow them out of the water.  Some parrots are just too strong but overall good wholesome privateering fun.

[Bliond action selection, Dice rolling for combat, Pirates] [5P:3, 4P:3] A fun middleweight game to play when the group is in mood for a low-investment dicefest. The theme is the best thing about the game, so don't expect great gameplay. Replay value is suspect, and 12 turns may be a bit too long. *** UPDATE: Whee, I've hit the ceiling for this game, which for me was about half-a-dozen plays. Now, it's becoming increasingly annoying, boring and repetitive all rolled into one. It was bound to happen - blind actions and die rolling to not contribute to longevity. No longer any desire to revisit whatsoever.

Fast-paced pirate action with lots of dice rolling and strong luck element, but also good atmosphere and theme.

+ Theme is great. 
+ Best for beginners and casual gamers. Works as a nice gateway too.
- The rulebook is a mess. At least the Finnish version of it. Many things aren't explained at all which may cause arguments between players.
- The boat components are too small and tend to flip over.

(Review is based on several plays.)

This one is a lot of fun, but there is a TON of work for a somewhat small payoff.  There are so many bits and pieces, and it's pretty easy to have your ship demolished over and over again, and that can be frustrating.

If you're looking for a hard-core game look elsewhere but if you want a light game loaded with theme then your ship has come in.  This game captures the poularized view of pirating in its mechanics as strategy and chance both having a role in winning. If you need an excuse to say "Yar" this is it!

RATING: 5
Pirate's Cove works well enough for what it tries to do: Provide a quick and fairly random pirate fix. It is quite chaotic due to the simultaneous action selection and it's true that avoiding conflict is often the best way to go, but then if everybody tries to play that way it's just the same game in reverse - which works just as well. There are, however, even better and less involved games for simply playing chicken.

The obvious advantage of Pirate's Cove over Merchants & Marauders is that it can easily play in an hour and doesn't carry nearly as much administrative overhead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This can definitely be fun, but I think it's biggest appeal is it's theme. If it were about farming would it get as high a grade? I don't think so. I also think that the pirates are too difficult and put an immense amount of imbalance to the game.

I found this to be a very fun game.  It didn't hurt that I won by a large margin.  I liked the simultaneous location picking.  There is some poker like "trying to read minds" aspects going on.  It does seem though that the person who gets into the least fights will win i.e. the most cowardly pirate.

I tried desperately to like this.  After a lackluster first and second impression I was determined to rework a few things in order to find some fun here.  The games looks beautiful, and in some ways extracts the pirate out of even the most introverted, but after the initial YoHo the game play lets you down.  So anyway, I spent a good long time concocting a variant to improve things and in ways it did - but not enough.

My thoughts on possible retooling:

This is simply a beginning to an overhaul in some areas of Pirate's
Cove’s rules.  I finally had the chance to play this weekend and found a
lot of what people have been saying about the rule issues to be true. 
So here are a few skeletons of ideas; please feel free to add feedback,
make alterations, or direct me to a rule suggestion of similar nature.
Let it also be known that in some instances, the rule change adds more
randomness in order to create a larger sense of pirate chaos.

1> Legendary Pirate Movement:

With the path of the infamous pirate ships known, unless she happens to
be the unguarded treasure ship, it is safe to say that only four islands
on any given round are in play.  It has been suggested that the
Legendary pirates make their rounds to the islands offering the most
fame, but again people will avoid such complications, and possible
sinking and decide amongst the remaining four, as it is always safer to
go against a fellow pirate looking for fame than a legend already.  So
my suggestion: 

The legendary pirates move at the end of the navigation phase. Once the
players have decided to which island they will be sailing, a single dice
is rolled twice.  The first dice roll will determine where the legendary
pirate with the largest sails goes, as the second roll determines where
the other ventures.  I understand this is a random act, and will annoy
some, but the idea of knowing the whereabouts of a pirate legend before
you hear the boom of his cannons, to me, is rather ridiculous.  Plus
with ghost ships and the such sailing the seas around pirates cove, this
seems to me to be an acceptable bit of randomness.  

In addition to this, when fighting a legendary pirate if two or more
are fighting him, and the pirate is sunk the players remaining in combat
will share the fame.  If all but one retreats, the remaining ship if
victorious gets a multiplied modifier depending on how many ships fled.
for example if one ship leaves they get the fame on the card x2, if two
flee they get x3.

If at the end of the battle with the pirates, the remaining players
battle it out with each other to get control of the island, the losing
player will get his share of the fame still, but the victor will get the
amount of fame on the pirate’s card in treasure.

Also with this I was thinking of making the three player design cards
as deter legendary pirate: movement either being one island westward, 
or player's choice. One could also remove one card of each volley type, 
or battle type and make this adjustment.


2>Treasure Cards:

I believe to create a little more tension, and possible strategy behind
the selection of islands, the given rule of discarding all face up
treasure cards be omitted.  I haven't tried these out, but this is what I am thinking.

a) The first idea is to keep all face up treasure cards not plundered
on their respective islands, while all plundered treasure becomes
discarded.  This of course will set the amount of treasure on each
island at different levels, and possibly make for the game to last a
little longer than the initial year time frame (that is of course,
unless you still decide to allow for the twelfth turn to be the end). The
resource of treasure and fame on each island will decline at different
levels, so as the game progresses you are forced to set sail to more
remote, but resource friendly islands.  To me this makes sense. Firstly,
no one at the tavern is going to care about people plundering islands
Pirate raids have devastated for years.  And secondly it
forces players to consider their ships upgrades.  If towards the end
only three islands have treasure remaining chances are if you have been
doing early treasure grabs and not making improvements you will be hurt
down the line.  The game would end when one island remains with three or
fewer cards, or two islands with two or less.  
In addition to this, every time an island is fully plundered and no
treasure cards remain, a +1 modifier is added to the value of each
remaining treasure card.  So if two islands are empty, each island still
holding treasure has a modifier of +2, and so on.  This should generate
the idea of treasures becoming more valuable as the resources dwindle,
and it should make for more conflicts.

(This could also be done without modifiers)

Another thought to add to this would be that if playing with the random placement of the legendary pirate, when a pirate lands upon a plundered island he moves
westward till he lands on the next island with treasure.  if both pirates land on the 
same island the second pirate moves on one, and stops there even if plundered.

b) Another possibility would be, that if a legendary pirate is on an unoccupied
 island he gathers the plunder (takes the card).  Through continuing rounds the 
legendary pirate can accumulate cards.  This will make a conflict with such pirate's enticing, as they could easily be worth 20 fame, 50 gold,  20 treasures, or any combination.
This suggestion was challenged by my brother suggesting that all a player might do is do nothing but build up their ship in order to challenge the legendary pirate at end game guaranteeing victory.  This wouldn't work if played with the random nature of the pirate's movement, plus there is a chance you may have to share the plunder with another player. This would maintain the game's initial length, plus make the battle against black beard, or any of the others more attractive.

3> Battle

Since dice rolls determine battles already, I thought it might be better to 
adopt a system closer to classic risk (I know I said the R word).  Here’s how I see it working:

The player with the higher sail count gets a free initial attack, where he/she rolls the difference in sails in dice amount.  For example if one players sails were at 7, and another's at 6, the player with the most sails would roll one die - still needing a 5 or 6 to hit.  With this said no more than three dice could be rolled, even if one player had sails of twelve and the other 5. The difference of seven would still only equal three dice.  

After the initial attack is resolved, regular battle begins.  Dice amount is still determined by equipped cannons and crew as in the official rules.  So if you have 5 cannons and five crew you are still able to roll 5 dice, just as if you have 5 cannons and three crew you would only be allowed to roll three.  Here’s the difference.  Instead of taking turns, players roll simultaneously choosing the amount of cannons they wish to fire.  For example if you have the ability to fire four, you can roll four dice, however, you could also choose to fire only one.
This enables the player to make judgments against the odds.   The amount of 
dice chosen will be equal to the risk in that battle turn.  You can only lose the amount of upgrades equal to the choice in dice you roll - but you must always roll at least one.  If you roll one, you can only be knocked down one upgrade if you lose that roll.  However, like in risk the more dice you play the more chance you have for better rolls, but also for more damage.  The highest dice will then be compared, the winner getting to do damage to his opponent's ship.  Then the second highest will be compared and so on until all rolls are resolved.  Round two then commences, and so forth until there is a victor or an opponent flees.

I have thought of possibly allowing for reload rounds. An example of this would be if say you have all 6 cannons.  You could choose to fire three this round, but in doing so next round you would be left with only three to fire, as the others are being reloaded.  I feel this might only work however if there is more of a bonus to having an advantage in cannon numbers. This could be determined by first comparing rolls as stated above, and then once that is resolved, all remaining dice with a five or six counts as an additional hit that round.  To make this work
It would be done that a player's maximum dice roll on any turn is equal to one less than the cannons they have equipped.  So if you have 6 cannons, you can only fire five on any given round- so that on the next round you have your minimum of one to fire.


4>Retreating

If a player retreats from battle with another player without being crippled he/she loses 2 victory points, and the remaining player gains one.  If a player retreats from a legendary pirate they lose 1 victory point if not hit.  

Mutiny occurs on a roll of 1 or 2.


As I mentioned earlier I have not yet play tested any of these, they are just thoughts occurring as I avoid work.  I hope to try some out tonight, and write a follow up. Again, if anyone has comments, or suggestions, please let me know. It would be a wonderful thing to get a rules set that truly makes this game what it was meant to be.  If these all fail, then I suppose the board and components are attractive enough to completely create a new game.

Pirates are a$$holes.

Initial game was somewhat cumbersome, but we were all tired after a long weekend. Two years later it gets another play and was a lot easier than I remember.

It was a great game to play with my older two (when they were 7 and 4) because the latter just chose destinations randomly - which makes things both interesting and fun.

I should break this out again now that the youngest is 4 and can do the same thing.

I'm not fond of simultaneous blind selection games when that feature has such a large impact on the outcome of the game.

Update: the game is broken- avoid battles and you win. It's still fun for kids, though.

new 3-28-05. A fun game but I need to play more before giving this a more thorough rating thought. After a couple more plays (7-26-06) I am lowering this game. Once again the Pirates in the game just got in the way. No one ever risked their ships going after them. I think that the value for defeating them is way to low. Increase the value of getting one of them significantly and then perhaps an effort will be made to go after them. Until that happens those pirates are insignificant to the game ..... so the value of the game goes down.

It simply wasn't nearly as fun for me as most people make it out to be. There's a lot of bookeeeping involved.  Battles weren't very fun, as people simply attack the lowest rated ship feature every time.  If you have a bad early round or two, you're effectively out of the game.

RATING: 5
I really hoped Pirate's Cove would be better...but I have to conclude that it's fairly average. It's a second-guessing and bluffing game with a pirate theme, but with a fiddlyness that makes it difficult for beginners. The cards in particular add lots of exceptions and twists, and only the rules can explain the game phase in which a card is played. It appeals initially to light gamers, but the loooong explanations necessary puts them off. Shame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Psychology of guessing "safe" islands plus dice in combat makes for a heaps of chaos and randomness.  However, the theme is great and it plays well as long as you know not to take it seriously.  It's just an excuse for pirate-speak and trash-talking.  However, due to the many different types of tavern cards, this one can be a bit difficult for new gamers to know what best to do.  Open card hands might be a good idea for the learning game.

RATING: 8
While the movement system in this game is innovative, it feels like it's missing something. The game falls short, as the ending is sort of anti-climactic, and if one is smart enough, you can avoid all combat, and take the lead. But, what fun is it being a pirate when you can fire your cannons into the enemy and call him a 'Scurvy Dog?'. A good family game, but not one for the serious gamer.

My kids absolutely love this game. Rating went up based on that. Despite being a roll and move, it is quite fun.

I feel like I should like PC more than I do. Everyone else seems to. I think that my distaste has to do with how devestating PC can be if you get off to a bad start. A couple of die rolls can truly destroy the gaming experience because losing battles on 2 or 3 of the early rounds puts you at too large a disadvantage to ever come back (unless you become unbelievably lucky throughout the remainder of the game).

This game is fun to play and actually offers some interesting strategic options between the screaming and yelling in the battles/dice rolls. To me, however, it overstays its welcome in light of what it offers. This is another game that would be absolutely great if it went faster and had fewer time-consuming dice rolls, each of which only involve a few of the players. If the battles were streamlined e.g. to only involve one round of dice rolls each, or the like, to speed things up, the atmosphere could be maintained while making everything go faster.

This game is so much fun!! On first glance, it gives the impression of a roll and move game (the board is divided into squares and the game is supplied with dice), however the mechanisms of simultaneous destination selection are very different from that, and I thought they worked well. The theme is wonderfully well created and the game's bits have a high 'chrome' factor (read: 'gorgeous bits') which really add to the atmosphere. I will not hesitate to play this one again (and again!)

In my first attempt, I thought it was so pointless and chaotic that I was glad when the group decided to call it off after the first turn. Years later, I eventually played a full game and thought it was reasonably fun - when things are going well for you. Unfortunately, it can be terribly annoying and frustrating when you are defeated in battle and keep being crippled because of bad guesses. I generally dislike games with simultaneous action selection where players are penalized for making identical choices, and here this is taken to the extreme. On top of that, luck plays a huge role, particularly in the wildly unbalanced tavern cards. And the decisions are not very interesting. On the positive side, the theme does come alive. But theme alone doesn't make up for poor gameplay, and I've never been much of a pirates' fan, anyway.

RATING: 5
After one play (4 player game) this one was fairly enjoyable.  Yes, it boils down to a dice fest, but it was light and interesting.  Fun psychological element in deciding which island to go to.  Seems that the legendary pirates are a little too strong so I'm not sure what the advantage is in going after them.  Would certainly play again.

Easy to learn and fast playing game.  Players select which island they are going to and combat occurs if more than one player goes to the same island.  Only one player gets to collect the booty (listed on a card) for each island.  Nice components.  Played many 4 and 5 player games.  The addition of an extra Pirate ship should make the game scale well with three players, as it limits ones choices.  The 4-player game is what I prefer to date.

Days of Wonder has gained a good reputation for high-quality components, colorful graphics, and immersive gameplay. When Pirate's Cove came out, this was an exciting game, with a high fun-factor.

However, with a number of repeated plays, it became quickly clear that the winner was usually one who avoided conflict with other pirates. If one could deduce where everyone else was going, and go somewhere else, they would fare better. The others would have a rocking good time blowing each other up with the almost comical, yet deadly combat, but the payoff wouldn't be enough to compensate for the risk.

Further, despite excellent rules, it is a rather complex game to explain due to the variety of tavern cards. Newbies would be at a disadvantage, as it required a good understanding of the tavern cards to do well.

Like most Days of Wonder games, this was a quick burst of fun and frivolity, but then suffered a slow death of "meh". It's a '5'.

Update (02/04/11): Sold! It has found a happy home in a family of five children! The feedback I hear is that they just love it! I am glad someone else can enjoy this game, because I was certainly done with it.

It's craps with a theme—but oh, what a theme!  Makes you lose your voice, though.  "I feel a 'nyar' comin' on... [i]NYARRR!!![/i]"

:arrrh:

The unofficial subtitle for this game is [i]Guess Wrong & Fight![/i]  It's best to avoid everyone as the loser of a sea battle tends to get hammered into an irrevocable last place.  On the surface this would seem to be anti-piratey but in reality it's probably accurate—skulking around avoiding "fair" fights while preying on the weak.

It is terribly annoying, though, as the winner gets more and more powerful and goes over the horizon into the sunset.

Best played with the understanding that it's a completely random experience game that doesn't yield to thought, planning, or strategy.

It feels as if this game ultimately boils down to guessing which port no one else will.  Hell, save yourself an hour...take out the dial. Randomly select a port 12 times.  Determine which player picked the port no one else did the greatest number of times.  Crown said player as winner.

Simultaneous action selection game--with pirates and cannons.  Overall, it is pretty random, but like any simultaneous action selection game, it's necessary to think about what your opponents are up to.  The game is extremely pretty and building up your ship is fun.  Very light. (1 play)

RATING: 6
This is a fast game. I like the decisions you make, but I'm a little worried about the "uncontrolled random-ness." You can build up your ship, but somebody with better dice rolls can totally destroy it. Or you can land on an island that no one else goes to, or constantly have to enter battles with others.

This a fun game with with unique board and objective.  There are many ways to get victory points so there is some strategy to figure out.  Not to mention what to upgrade.  The luck plays in with the dice and whether or not another player picks where you want to go.  It can be fun to do battle with other ships if you win.  However if you lose, it's back to the shipyard which doesn't seem to be all that bad either.  At least it could be worse.

Lite fare accessable to the family set. Most of the fun is about maxing out the stats on your cool pirate ship --which has nothing to do with actually winning of course.

I enjoyed this one along with the rest of my group, everyone rating it an 8 or 9, regardless of their fate.  It is solidly in the family game bracket with the luck factor, but there is nothing wrong with that.  It's incredibly fun allowing for all sorts of silliness.  Yes, it's frustrating to get beaten by luck, whether from the dice or the cards, but fortunes change and next game it could be you with favorable winds filling your sails.  I enjoyed the theme, thought it was well worked out.  It is one of the few boards we have actually played twice in a session in a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun with the maximum number of players, as long as you aren't looking for deep strategy. Building up your ship is fun, as is trying to outguess your opponents destinations. With five players there's a battle every turn, which is necessary to keep things interesting. With fewer players it becomes a move-buy-move game without much tension.

Excellent bits and integrated theme.  Game  moves quickly, and keeps everyone involved.  Battles are quick, and tension filled, as a few bad rolls or a few lucky ones can give any side the victory.

A tad long and a little luck-heavy. But if you reduce from 12 to 8 turns it's a fun family romp. lots of interaction and laughs.

The rules are TOO long, and you must fix or use player aids

pirates cove

Yes. I think the ruels are partly the problem here - pretty verbose.

The game is much easier to play than read about.

For a light-medium game, it's a little complex to start with, though as you say, the theme is unbeatable with the right people.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2010)

One of the first boardgames I ever played. I never really liked very much, but as I didn’t knew many games, we played this a lot. The game has great components (as most Days of Wonders games), but it is too shallow for my tastes, it has a lot of luck, (more or less) obvious choices and nowadays I don’t want to play it. At that time I thought the theme was pretty neat, however, since I played Merchants and Marauders (a VERY BAD game), I really don’t want to play a pirate game. It is a light pirate game that takes a long time to play (for what the game offers), it seems if you are knocked early on the game, you can never recover. 

The game can be great as a family game, or to introduce new gamers to our hobby. 

I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings with the BGG recommendation system. Pirate`s Cove is a game I would play from time to time (only if requested), but not a game I will pursue. 

Current Rating: 4.0

A damn fun, rowdy time! 

With a lively group and the mood's on you, it's a blast.

Guess and double guess, hit and run, beautiful production, a great family game that has a learning curve depending on your gaming background (do not let that scare you away from it, it's not hard at all, some things will just be new to some players).

Wonderful fun with a peppy group.

Good fun, although there's not that much game underneath the chrome. Your main decision each turn is choosing which of the 6 islands to visit, and there's an element of double-guessing as you try to avoid stronger enemies while picking on weaker ones. After that it's tactical stuff about choosing when to fight and when to run when you find another pirate at your destination, and choosing your reward should you gain cotrol of an island for the turn. (The latter is generally an easy choice - you probably decided when you initially chose to go to that island). It is worth planning a turn or three in advance, especially towards the end game. Good use of theme.

Didn't get me - maybe because I see little correlation between the game and any reality of the 17th century caribbean piratism. Feels like a theme-park ride with very little depth; there's a lot of chance, and little possibility for the players to affect the odds. Provides some fun, but not much.

I think this game is kind of fun. I enjoy playing it but my group loves it far more than I do, which really effects my enjoyment of the game; they want to play it every single night. There is a great deal of luck involved. The only real decision making is during the bluffing/picking your destination phase. It's an enjoyable game most times but not as often as I am forced to play it.

Very light game. Heavy luck. Little strategy. Heavy theme.

Fun.  For once in a eurogame the theme actually fits. The battles are exciting, and it's a blast to fight the pirate or bring in the navy against an opponent.  Okay for a "family game", too much luck and no real decision for "real gamers" (which I am not). In the end, kind of has the worst of both worlds: all the fiddliness of eurogame, but without the depth and satisfying decisions. Don't think there's enough game there underneath all the theme. (Contrast with e.g. Blue Moon City.)  Yet... still seems okay as an (imperfect) family game, especially if shortened to 9 turns instead of 12.  5-player leads to best ratio of battles, Not as good with 3 (maybe try the "fog" variant?). With 2 try the "2 islands blocked by fog" variant (which works pretty well).

I have Days Of Wonder version. At first for not english people it looks like so complicated due to tavern cards translations. It's so difficult to know all cards. However as soon as you play it twice or three times you understand all the game that it is quite simply. Rules don't help so much because some information is missing. In any case after you have learn to play it is a funny game to play with friends.

Pirate's Cove appears to a light family game, but there is more here than meets the eye. There is adequate depth and strategy to make for a satisfying smash-up on the high seas for seasoned gamers. The pirate theme comes across nicely, and the game is wonderfully produced. Plenty of interesting decisions to be made, including constantly asking "where are *they* going, and where do they think *I* am going?" A well-designed, enjoyable game that can be played at several levels.

At the moment it is a most played game in our family ... very appealing for the younger players and not too boring for the older ones.

21.1.2006: My opinion of this drops after each game. I guess it's because it feels like it tries to be two different games at the same time.

I guess I'm not the target for this game.

"Unabashedly fun" is how I described this game this past weekend.  Yeah, it's a dice-fest, but there are also lots of decisions to make.  And it's fun -- did I mention that?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great theme.  Very comprehensive of the pirate ouvre.  Except for combat.  The payout for battling another player is so laughably small that it pays to avoid other players.  Not very piratey.

Update: After playing Merchants and Marauders and Jamaica this game is really starting to wear its welcome.

Lots of fun role playing. Play this if you want to act like pirates, but for the best playing experience, either accept the luck factor or come up with some variants. I like the "negotiation" variant.

My friends enjoy this one, but something about the game doesn't work right for me. For kids, maybe this would be okay, but I tend to look for a richer game experience. A lot of flash and not much substance.

RATING: 5
I really like this game. Or, at least, I really WANT to like this game. The trouble is that in both of the games that I've played (both with four), one player who was defeated in an early round went on to get pounded over and over and was never really in the game. So what would be a 7.5 or an 8 drops to six, at least until I find or develop a variant to fix this problem.

Other complaints about "the pirate who doesn't fight wins" are somewhat exaggerated. For one thing, you can't always avoid combat. There are also variants to help alleviate this problem.

I really think that the game is worth picking up if you're looking for a light family-oriented theme-heavy game.

So ready to trick this game out with faux diamonds and treasure chests and the like.  It is too pretty not to. 
Oh yeah, and I'd like to try playing it at some point, too.

Did a kid-ified version of it with my 5 year old.  We both enjoyed it.  She was squite takenback when she had to battle Captain Hook!   It was a great moment. 

One adult play so far, and I really really enjoyed this.  love the simultaneous movement mechanism.  Excellent.

Unfortunately, this just never seems to hit the table.  Boo!  I may try to reclaim this at some point, but for now, it leaves the collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Played 5+ times.  A hit with (young-ish) kids.  Becomes tedious but finishes fairly quickly which is good.  No scope to make genuine strategic decisions, but I will happily play once in a while.  Problem: needs 5 players to ensure interaction but downtime becomes a big problem.  Winner is the person who avoids combat, which is a bit un-piratey!  Very attractive though!

Fun game, there is some luck but can be mitigated by observing others. Legendary ships are hard to take down without proper cards and coop play!

Dice Tower #3 Pirate Game.

Had a fun experience with this one. It's all about interaction and this might put off those who like engine building games.

Lots of non-thematic rules. But still felt like a pirate game. Can easily be sewered by a string of bad dice rolls.

The navigation spinner is rather loose so you have to keep your thumb on the dial to keep it in place during reveal.

The theme says "be the baddest pirate of them all"

The game says "avoid conflict at all costs."

Simple, fun Pirate game with both ship combat and exploring.  Might be a runaway leader problem.  Early luck definitely helps.  Very uneven card strength.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In all honesty a rating of 6.5 is not fair to this game. There have been plays of this game that I would easily rank in my top 10 favorite game sessions of all time.  It truly can be a blast to play and maybe deep down I would give this game a rating of 8.5 or even 9.  Why the low rating?  Because this game is made or broken with the people you play with and unfortunately I’ve been on the broken side too many times.

First of all, this game is susceptible to having a runaway leader.  It also is susceptible to having a weaker player only get beaten down more: combine a game where a single player will have incredibly good luck and dominate while simultaneously there is a another player having horrible luck and is getting beat down each turn, and you get one ugly potential.  Also, this game is meant to embrace the theme.  You have to talk like a Pirate, act like a Pirate, and just enjoy the experience as a whole.  Treat this game like you would your typical Euro and you’re in for a bland and painful experience.  Finally, the game can drag on for what it is.  I often reduce the treasure card stacks to 9 otherwise the game can sometimes take 2 hours.

But, if you do get a group that gets into this, if they are willing to give themselves pirate names (I love starting out that way), and if everyone is able to enjoy the experience, then I rate this game an 8.5 without thinking twice.

(3-5 players)  Secretly choose your port, and war with other pirates if you choose the same place.  Retreat back to Pirate's Cove if you lose.  If you win, collect treasure, gold, and victory points, build up your ship's crew, sails, cannons, and hull, and bury your treasure at Treasure Island.

I like the pirate theme and of course the DoW production is excellent. However the gameplay is mediocre. The core mechanics are fun, but the game takes too long for what it is. There are severe runaway leader problems, given the reliance on combat. A very chaotic game.

Two games in, I find this pretty tedious. Maybe with a more experienced group, this would be OK, or if everyone talked like a pirate, but it can be really dry. In other words, you really need to bring something to it 'cause it ain't really there on its own.

Very lavish Days of Wonder production, which is nice.  However, the underlying game itself is quite random.  I have no problem with the randomness as long as the game is short.  At 45 minutes I would gladly play this again.  But if I knew that the game would take over an hour I would almost always pass.  One big problem I have with the game is that it seems better to simply just avoid conflict at all costs, which isn't very piratey.  If I was a pirate, that's how I would operate, but I probably wouldn't be a very profitable pirate.

RATING: 5
After first play, I´ll have to say that Pirate´s Cove was not as elegantly simple and clear, as eg Ticket to ride or Memoir 44, two great games from DoW... There was much more flicking through the rulebook, and a few mistakes were made, that did have an impact on the game and the eventual winner. Other than that, I´ll have to say that it was a FUN game, dripping with more theme than tactical decisions, or in other words: more laughing than thinking! I reread the rules, clearing up the mistakes, and will add more comments after further plays...

Hmm, a little disappointed considering the hype. I don't think this plays well as a 3 player game. We went for 8 months (game turns) without an encounter. It was pretty boring. 

[Updated] With more players, it is certainly a better game. More battles and more fun, however the random factor remains quite high.

I really enjoyed the mechanic of improving your hull, mast, or cannons and having a special crew/parrot to give special abilities.  The rest of the implementation could use some work though.  A damaged ship may struggle the entire game to get repaired and back on track with other ships and certainly weaker ships have to be very careful in where they go.  Ultimately, since destinations are hidden, they may have no choice but to take more hits and get no benefits if they choose the same location as someone else.  Overall though I enjoyed this game and would like to see it implemented better.  I was hoping Pirates of Nassau would fill that desire but so far I haven't been overwhelmed by what I've seen with that game either.

RATING: 7
Not sure about this one.  Gameplay is fun, but battles are long, lucky, and *devastating* to the loser.  Also, WAY too many rules for the scope of the game.  And, tavern cards that add fame points seem kind of ho-hum.  The dilemma of burying treasure at treasure island vs upgrading your ship and receiving points at the others is the best aspect of the game, in my opinion.

Most of this rating comes from the unbelievable beauty of the game and bits.  the game itself, while fun, is not very strategic and very randomn.  Dice ruin alot of games and dice make alot of games fun and tense.  It ruins this one too much.
Loses another 1/2 point for length of play.  Not worth the time for a game this luck driven.

Very fun simple wargame. You select a location to get loot and/or upgrade your ship. Land in the same place with someone else and you'll begin a quick bit of combat.

The game's beatifull, rewards good (and unpredictable) play without being too punishing when you fail.

Easy to grasp for a beginner. Would keep it in my collection regardless but might serve quite well as a gateway game regardless.

Rated after 9 plays. 
Rules aren't very well written. It's taken us a few plays to get it right. We also now play with the variant that the legendary pirate moves randomly. Can't be taken seriously, since there is a lot of luck and randomness. Very difficult to build a strategy. Just have to deal with the randomness as much as possible and hope the dice are good to you. Great components.

RATING: 5
DOW edition.  A wonderful game for kids, with just enough strategy and decisions to occupy their attention and prep them for greater fare.  If you play with children under 10, there are enough things going on and so many little bits that in order to play you will have to act like a lion tamer.  Best attribute: components, of course.  Worst attribute: game length...needs to be house-ruled into a shorter game; although the kids could keep sinking each other forever.  A must-have if you have 7-10 year olds; can't imagine why I would ever play it with adults.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Arrrr!Neat RPG aspect of building your ship and even finding a parrot for your shoulder.  Every turn you choose one of the islands to go to, revealing simultaneously.  Each island provides a single resource, which is sometimes in demand between 2  players.  So when 2  people choose the same island, ship combat occurs.  Interesting blind game theory to decide which island you're going to get a resource: "he thinks that I think that he thinks...."  Too bad the person who avoids these random PvP incursions will come out way ahead, while the persons that don't will end up on the rehab island as combat results are often brutal (and random). to  In my games, I prefer having the feeling I will win with proper skill, and while the fun factor is present, it is too chaotic to give me a good feeling even if I did win.  The guy who did win stayed at the tavern for half the game, where you can go instead of an island to draw power up cards instead, and came out with incredible parrot cards that let him dominate.  It was all for a good laugh and glad I didn't purchase.  Would play again with a house rule that involes shots when you visit the tavern.

Acquired in 2004. Total number of plays = 15. Not very high on strategy, although it has a fun "try to outguess your opponents" aspect. It's gratifying to build a faster, stronger, more powerful ship. And even though judiciously avoiding battles is the better way to win, it's fun to do battle with other ships (and possibly lose). Beautiful components. The ship marker rings slide off too easily.

Had this for a long time and played several times through. I can only imagine that it works better with a full five players, rather than three or four. It has lovely components and plenty of bits that can be replaced with custom parts. But somewhere mid-game, when you have to visit the same island for the fourth time because the previous three attempts you've been blown to bits by another player or a black ship, you begin to think, "Why am I playing this? Where's the fun?"

The fun, I think, is in another pirate game somewhere else. I don't know what pirate game that would be, because it seems that nearly every pirate game suffers from some fatal flaw. Someday, some designer will find the fun in pirate games.

Gorgeous board - quality is an A+.  I really wanted to enjoy this game, but found it too random as well as a dice-fest.  Something for the kiddies.  Rumor has it that the best option for winning is to avoid combat altogether.  This is true and thus breaks the game.

Pirate's Cove - Yes, it's a dice fest, but there's something about this game that appeals to me.  There's strategy in them thar waters.  If you find yourself fighting other pirates too often, then you're not trying hard enough to second guess, or outthink your opponent  The grapics are beautiful and the game has nice bits.  And it's just plain fun to play!   Set sail for adventure but 'ware the Royal Fleet and the Legendary pirates!  "Arrgh!  Shiver me timbers!"  (November 2004)

My favourite game for a long time, this game combined a good amount of strategy in ship preparation and choosing the place to go that no one else chooses (or where they are most likely to go if you want to take big risks for big treasure!)

This is a neat game that increases with difficulty the more people that play it. I only wish there were more places to sail to! 

This game doesn't take long to play, which is good for small game sessions. My only problems with this game are: 1. the rule book sems to indicate that if a black ship is defeated, it is replaced with a new legenardy pirate. That's fine. Unless you have two on the board and the undefeated one is currently at Treasure Island. This would put both ships sailing together, which would be a nasty combination. Then again, with the game as short as it is, two legendary pirates are plenty.
2. If you are sent to Pirate's Cove, the trend seems to be that you will end up spending most of your game there. It seems really hard to make a comeback after you have lost a battle, especially with more than 2 players.

Great theme, great artwork and great components. The game itself is very simple pillage-fight-pillage-fight and can get on your nerves when your ship is blown to smithereens all the time, but still it's a good game.
Gets regular plays even though almost every game results in (short) silent treatments :)

i don't understand why people dislike this one.  great graphics, fast gameplay, simultaneous actions, sink your friends, or go for maximum booty by engaging an automaton pirate.  yes there are dice, but you build your probability . go figure.

An excellent game with a little extra time necessary for explanation to non-gamers that is nonetheless worth the effort.

Though a luck-based dice-fest, it accurately captures the terror of the high seas. It's more fun to come up with silly names for your pirate ship, and so on.  Last time we played it, we spoke with outrageously bad piratical accents.  The game is just fun, that is all there is to it.

RATING: 8
Disapointed that it wasn't a bit more 'adventure' oriented. The board really serves no purpose other than to keep track of the black pirate (why are the squares on the board????), but it's a lot of fun for the sake of theme and a bit of second guessing in an advanced form of rock/paper/scissor makes this a great multi-player filler.

Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared Pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the Tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome Pirate of the High Seas!

RATING: 7
Probably best with 4 plyrs.  3-plyrs might not have enough tension whereas 5-plyrs is sometimes a bit too chaotic for my tastes b/c there's a high chance of combat every round and that one unlucky player will be caught in a death spiral of bad combats.  Maybe it's me, but others seem to really love the extra sessions of combat (I think combat is cool but excessive combat seems to create unbalanced sessions).  

[This is okay for a light pirate game but for a more advanced pirate game, I like Merchants & Marauders.]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Eh, its a decent pirate game if everyone seeks out conflict.  Otherwise, a winning strategy too often is to avoid conflict and pick up and deliver treasure.  It is pretty reliant on how well you roll the dice but there are strategical decisions to be made as well.  I believe it plays better with 4-5 than with two or three.  One variant I would make as well is that if your sails are same ranking, both roll at the same time and take damage accordingly.  If this forces both sides to retire to the cove, then the treasure is not won by either side.

RATING: 9
For the Days of Wonder edition: I'm giving this game a bonus point for the theme, but this is truly a fun game.  Very light, it lends itself to some good joking fun.  Days of Wonder, as they did with Mystery of the Abby, did a wonderful job putting together an incredibly attractive game.  My only incredibly minor quibble is that I would have liked the player's mats to be thicker, but the art on them is just incredibly.  When you look at the ship, starting to the left where all the lower values for your sails, crew, cannon, and hull are, as you look to the right you see vast improvements in each of those areas corresponding with the improvements you could make for your ship.  I highly recommend this one.

Look at the variants, there is a negotiation variant, we call it 'parlay' and it really adds to the game.  It goes from trying to guess where people are going to avoid them to guessing where they are going to bully them.  More piratee.

Pretty fun game; haven't played it with more than 4 players though.  Some of the event cards are pretty powerful, and battle cards inevitably tip the balance of power toward those that have them (and they can act as a psychological deterrent).  There's a bit of an inertia problem: usually our games have resulted in one player avoiding battles for a bit that allows him/her to build their ship to the point that others don't want to attack them, giving them an edge overall (pirate alliances are non-existent in our group).

Pirate's Cove lived up to my expectations and was very fun to play with 5 people.

Fantastic family game that lend's itself to both intense competition as well as friendly bonding. Easy for the =youngest members of the family to pick up and interesting enough for all ages to enjoy together. A small element of strategy adds to the challenge without being overwhelming, and the uncertainty that comes from everyone announcing their move at the same time keeps tensions high enough to keep it exciting.

My family added/modified the rules a little so that the game always ends with a grand battle at Treasure Island with the last remaining Pirate gaining an extra bonus.

I acquired this in hopes that it would be a pretty, big-box game that I could pull out to play with the kids.  It has delivered.  A bit more bookkeeping (upgrading ships, moving fame markers after combat, repairing at Pirates Cove) than I was expecting, but that's okay.  With a little help, they do just fine.  This didn't bother the kids at all and they're excited about playing again, so Pirate's Cove is a winner in my book.  *UPDATE* We played this during the last 2 game nights.  Game is too fiddly for us, was constantly looking in the rulebook for some small detail or something.  Traded 10/05.

I want to like this one more than I do based on appearance, theme, and rock-paper-scissors mechanic.  Great artwork and bits and all.  But it all seems to boil down to die rolls.  Hoity Toity does a better job with the RPS mechanic and just about every other conflict game does a better job with the fighting.  You are left with some nice pirate-y chrome and a kid's game amount of strategy.

game got a lot of play when the kids where 10-15 and who can pass up a game where you talk like a pirate and have parrots and lots of cannons to blow yer foe to bits!

Good components and shows well - just not getting to the adult table these days. :-(

test solo play.
Looks like fun.

PLayed with 5. One of the players thought this game was too fiddly and complex, though they got on fine with Puerto Rico. They also did not like Jamaica so maybe its just the pirate theme. I think this is fine. You try to balance beefing up your ship with collecting treasure/coins while also thinking about what the others will do. 

Even though I lost every single battle and my ship sucked, I still managed to come very close to the leader by collecting the fame cards. Fun game with differnt strategies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Despite the theme, might be worth trying after Cleopatra and the Society of Architects. 

Vs. Jamaica (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/392963/pirates-cover-vs-jamaica): Then I would pick "Jamaica" - simply because it is far more playable: both gamers and non-gamers find it fun. And it doesn't take long to play, so it is easy to get onto the table.

"Pirate's Cove" is longer, and it takes time to explain all the rules to new players - and very few women find the game attractive.

I love Pirate-themed games, and this one has nice artwork and good components to boot. Some reviews have suggested that this game fails on the theme because it discourages combat, but I disagree. Although early combat can be fairly random, the reward for losing can be helpful, and once you've armed your ship (collecting some treasure along the way), combat against the famous pirates is quite profitable. Eurogamers who favour strategies with minimum risk won't enjoy this, but most everyone else will.

(Traded for [thing=156129][/thing] in the [geeklist=220998][/geeklist], 2017-02-XX)

Pirate's Cove is basically a combination of bluff and dice fighting. The game is very thematic but is too long for its worth. 6-8 turns would be sufficient. Also with 3 players having 2 legendary pirates doesn't work well as it basically just blocks 2 islands.

Update: As we have played the game more, it has lost some of its luster. Once you get the hang of the gameplay, it becomes a bit predictable. On the other hand, it remains the most likely game to pull out with new players and we almost always have a good time. Moved from 9 to 7.

There is a fairly high luck factor, since you need to pre-set your destination at the beginning of the turn and you might find yourself in a fight with one (or more) of the other ships. Luck comes into play in combat as it gets resolved by lots of dice rolling. It is a light-hearted and fun game.

Ok where do I start. This game may be fun for a 6 year old kid but I am not one of those so for me it stinks. 

I will go on record as saying that the game is well made and looks great. I wish the developer had put as much time into play testing this thing as they did in making the parts. 

Whats is wrong with this one? well for starters there is very little strategy. Guessing what island to head to is about it. If you guess wrong you roll dice to fight. If you roll bad you are then screwed. After this point you are certainly screwed if you guess wrong on the next turn and have to fight again.
Thats really the whole game. 

The other major issue is that some of the parot cards are insane! They are way too strong and so if you are lucky and get one (the one that gives you 6 shots is nuts) you will have a huge advantage over anyone who does not have one. 

anyway I will not be playing this often if at all again.

Unfortunately, the first person who gets a lucky die roll in this game will win it, because their ship will go from strength to strength while the others have to start from scratch each time they guess coves wrongly.  A major modification of ships returning to their upgraded strength in the pirate's cove after losing a fight may make the game more fun, but I haven't had the desire to play the game again to find out.

One of the most beautiful games I own. Great theme and lots of interaction. Even my non-confrontational "can't-we-all-just-get-along" friends like this one, despite the many battles that occur. I only wish that the legendary pirates were more capable of being defeated so they could see more action than simply being a "do not enter" marker on an island. Spendy ($40), but worth it in my mind as it is fun to play, and routinely requested by friends and family.

I will need to play this game again.  I think we all took the game a little to serious and got a little to frustrated with things that we should have just realized were part of the game.  I want to wait for a second playing before rating.

The second game went much better.  It was a very exciting ending.  I had a boat load of treasure and risked fighting the Black Pirate ship on turn 12 rather than going for the safer thing on turn 11.  The battle was very close.  If he had gotten me one more time before I finished him off, I would have lost the game rather than won it.  But man did that ending make the game fun.

Yet another amazing production from Days of Wonder. It looks almost too pretty to play. Great theme, fairly quick game play, interesting mechanics. A bit of luck involved, but not overly. If you build your boat well you can deal with bad rolls. If you are smart, you can guess where your oponents or the pirates will be next and avoid them. Good gateway game, as long as you don't show them the huge roll book and scare them off. It really isn't as complicated as such a large book makes it appear.

Fun, pirate theme-game. The game seems to reward those players who shy away from combat, but that just adds to the strategy IMO. Was well received with my group, and is sure to see more plays in the future. After some play with my 7 & 5 year olds I have to bump this to an 8.5. This is a great, light, family game that even my 5 year old picked up in a hurry (him liking pirates didnt hurt either). For kids, the theme REALLY stands out. Sailing their ships, plundering islands, and burying treasure really makes it exciting for them....several games and no "loser" yet.

Like all pirate games it is always good to get in the spirit of things.

RATING: 5
Ugh, I'm very bad at this game (mainly because I can't predict my opponents well and avoid them when my ship is hurting).  The basic premise is good, but the player interaction boils down to wargame tactics with lots of dice rolling, which I really don't enjoy.  There's so much I like about this game, and I can often be talked into playing it, but I never end up getting much enjoyment out of it.  It also suffers from virtual player elimination (and I usually end up being that person), which takes away from the overall enjoyment factor.  It can be a fun game to play with casual gamers every once in a while, but I certainly never suggest it for more serious gameplay.

As with most DoW games, the presentation and parts quality are top notch.  Rules are relatively straight-foward and easy to explain.  What bugs me is that you really want to avoid the other guy and be left alone.  Not very swashbucking or "pirate-like" adventurous, if you ask me.  This would be OK for kids though, as the components are pretty cool and the play is on the simple side.

The theme shines through making it a great family/kid's game.  My poor rating relates more to what I prefer in a game than in the actual merits of the design; this one is simply not my style due to the chaotic element (guessing where other pirates will go) and die-dependent outcomes.

A great entry level game that is fun with 3 or 4 other people.  Lots of laughter based on the surprising battles that result.  Using the variant rule to randomly place the roaming pirate adds good flavor.  Having played a few times, I am much less enamored with the game now.  Still good entry level, but not one I want to play weekly.

Though the game mechanics have a luck element of rolling dice, players can work around this by planning ahead.  The game moves quickly and can be taught easily.

RATING: 4
This isn't a bad game, per se -- but I find the base mechanic frustrating -- with the -primary- skill of the game being avoiding conflicts.  The fact that so much of the game is focused on winning such conflicts when you, despite your best efforts, end up in them (or in getting so ahead that you can benefit from seeking conflicts out rather than avoiding them) makes the game far less fun for me than an actually balanced game.

Played my first games of this, and my initial feelings are mixed.  Theme is nice, many aspects of gameplay mechanic are interesting and to my liking.  The random aspect to the combat system seems to be of the flavor that rubs me the wrong way however.  Maybe it was just odd rolls the two games I played, but in obviously lopsided battles, there still seemed to be a 50 % chance of failure for the ship that should have the overwhelming victory.  With more plays, I'll either adjust to the randomness, or it'll drive me bonkers, but I'm not certain which yet.  This score is almost certain to make a significant change in the future.

Randomness is too high for the game's duration.

Days of Wonder always has great production values and pieces for their games and Pirate's Cove is no exception. The game itself is quite fun and exciting! No deep strategies in this fairly light game. However, it's quite fun and enjoyable and the simultaneous pirate wheel navigation is a nice dynamic. If you're looking for a fun, slightly confrontational game that's got a great theme, then Pirate's Cove might hit the spot!

Pretty fun game.  Combat is generally very streamlined and quick.  And the theming is simply fantastic.

But personally I enjoy trying to guess what other players will do.

RATING: 6.7
Essentially it is a fun, daring, and random pirate game that fleshes it out fairly well. Only draw back to this game is the fact that it does take 90 minutes to work through the twelve rounds. Some plays I have found that people are wearing out around the tenth or eleventh round. Overall there is a good mix of luck and strategy providing a balanced game. Battles are dice determined but can always be augmented with cards; plus you can nearly always avoid a confrontation. Not sure why this is underrated but it is a game that, if there's the time, people will want to play it.

Like New condition (2nd copy owned).

I liked this one quite a bit the first time I played it.  The theme is really, really great and I had fun.  However, every time I've thought about playing it since then, I can think of other games that I'd rather play.  It might be fun for families or non-gamers; too little game there for gamers.

A good kids' game if they don't mind having their newly repaired ship blown to smithereens the next round.  Plays like a light filler for adults but a little long to be called a filler.  Very difficult to play this game strategically as often you are thrust into a battle you never wanted.

RATING: 7
The game is very easy on the eye (I expect nothing else from Days of Wonder), but the gameplay in Pirates Cove is a little too simplistic and luck driven, to the point where the only strategic decision you can make is a random guess at where everyone else will be for the turn. To make things worse, the game is also totally prone to king making, run away leaders, and uncontrollable losing with no way of making it back!

The thing is, I find myself increasing the rating to 7 anyway- I can't explain why, I just really like this game despite my reservations!

This is a great pirate game with mostly simple decisions mingled with luck. The luck is based on where players go (which may or may not result in combat) and / or rolling dice. There are also cards (from tavern) that change the game a bit. How valuable the card can be is situational and the luck of the draw. Losing in combat is not good, but the consequences are manageable. Great non-deterministic game.

Love this game. One of my new favourites. Looking forward to playing this tonight with some of the variants added in for a different game.

In order to speed up the game I included 6 matching coloured dice for each of the five colours. This removes the requirement to share dice. Also each person has one black dice which indicates the area of the ship that was hit.

Added a new randomness to the game that some people like and some don't:

Kraken  
======

* Roll 2 dice if doubles the kraken attacks all players ships at that island. 

* Roll 1 dice for each player to determine how many tentacles hit their ship (i.e how many attack dice it rolls against them)

* Kraken always has initiative given you don't see it coming from below you

* Kraken only attacks hull

* Each hit against the Kraken removes one tentacle ie. removes one attack dice.

* If the Kraken is beaten receive one fame for each tentacle you took out. (ie. the number of attack dice it originally rolled)

We don't really care much about historically accurate piracy, do we? Neither does Days of Wonder: it's the modern fantasy of pirates we're here for. Hence the numerous ship upgrades which are almost all oriented at making your pirate ship the bestest at taking down other pirate ships.

Then how come in such a game you win by avoiding fights at all costs? Because combat means the loser loses a lot while the winner has the now unchallenged treasure mitigated with losses. It's a bad proposition for all parties implied, especially since randomness places even the best ship on the table under the threat of potential serious damage. Not to forget NPC ships that are waaaaay too costly to fight. So here you are, trying to guess where you opponents are moving to in order to not sail there. Ultimately, a game about outhinking a single decision every turn, the outcome of which is quite swingy.

Light and entertaining with your typical cool Days of Wonder bits. All my plays took 1 hr or less so I'm not sure where the complaints of game length are coming from.

This game also suffers from Runaway Leader Syndrome.

Each player controls a pirate ship with upgradable sails, crew, cannons and hull. Secretly and simultaneously select one of six islands to visit. If two or more people go to the same island, combat ensues and resolved by dice rolling. In my only playing with 4 players, I had a real bad experience. I got hit on the first turn (opponent had faster sails, shot first and sent me directly to Pirate's Cove) and I was behind in upgrading my abilities. Everytime I tried to pick an island which I thought no one would go to, someone else was there, I would lose the battle since I was weak already. I was in a hole I could not get out of and it left a really bad taste in my mouth. I was left playing kingmaker with the random tavern cards. I was expecting more from a middleweight game. The components are nice, and it does make a fun family game, but really not fun as a eurogame. Perhaps I just had a really bad day, but it is too light.

Dripping with theme and atmosphere but not terribly engaging brain-wise.  After one play (which I won) I'd say that it's basically a huge, well produced version of rock-paper-scissors.  This one may increase with further playings.  
It definitely helped that I had my son's pirate hat and eyepatch on hand.  He also sat on my shoulders as my faithful parrot, squawking and repeating the last word that I said.

Painful dice-and-cards luckfest.  If you lose a battle or two early on, it's hard to catch up, especially if other players have been upgrading their ships in the meantime.  "Tavern cards" vary way too much in power.  Done with this game -- would prefer not to play again.

Please note that this is my personal rating.  You might enjoy this game.  Just don't feel bad if you don't -- you're not the only one.

One of my favourite games. We play it very often and it's always a lot of fun! We play it with a variant: you can combat on all islands. If two or more pirats are on the same island there is a timed negociation phase to share the ressources, if they agree there is no combat.

RATING: 6
All about sinking each others' ships, so it's very confrontational. The trouble is, you don't even get the satisfaction of choosing who to attack most of the time (it's just coincidence that you both chose to go to the same island) - yet players can still feel they are being picked on when bad luck just won't stop coming their way. Once you're down, it's hard to get back on top. Really sucks to get sunk over and over. Some OK ideas, but not really for me. A shame, since I love the board and bits!

A simple pirate game of collecting treasures and beating up on other pirates' ships. The components are absolutely excellent. This game is a good medium weight family type game of looting islands for treasure, upgrading your ship, and fighting any ship near you. This is, however, a very difficult game to get to the table. Even with our game group we never seem to pull this one out to play...the funny thing is the same thing happens with Cargo Noir. My wife and I played Pirates Cove once and then it sat on the shelf for a very long time. I recently found a 2-player variant that works and allows for just the 2 of us to enjoy the game. Thank goodness.

Pretty fun with all male relatives over Christmas.  But it was a little long.  And it seemed like luckily guessing where not to fight played a huge role in winning, as well as a lucky Cacafuego to start the game.  My wife and sister-in law (we usually play games of 4 with my bro- and sister-in-law) don't love direct conflict, especially if it's long, so this won't receive that much play time.  I can't tell if my score would go up or down with more plays anyway.  

It just got less appealing as I thought about it, so I sold it to a buddy for a deal.

It's a good game.  I just think that it could be better.  The fact that combat can cripple you so badly is annoying.

We started with 5 players, but the girls dropped out early ... and left us with 3 players. But all in all I liked the game. Once you get the rules and play sequence down, the game goes fast. But with only 3 players, we did not have as much fighting as would most likely happen with 5 players. I may increase my rating after a few more games. In the end, I had fun and look forward to playing it again. Strategy ... IMHO ... Get the cards, get a parrot, upgrade the cannons and crew, upgrade the sails to be the fastest and thus shoot first in combat, and of course, remember the the black ship will ALWAYS be at the treasure island on the last turn (only 12 turns in a game), so either be prepared to fight it, or else bury your treasure on the next to last turn (tuen 11) ... a quick fun game ... recommended, even for the younger players.

Simple enough, but long for what it is, is probably a fair summary. Have a look at the state of people boats (made up of hull, cannon, men, sails), and guess what island each player is likely to go for where they can build up an aspect of their ship, also weighing up the goodies for the taking at that island (they change each round). If your ship is in better fighting shape (more cannon, men, sails), go there and whack them. Otherwise, go somewhere else and hopefully peacefully build a better ship, gain treasure, victory points, gold or action cards.

The game last 90 minutes. 12 turns. The problem is downtime. Everyone decides where they’re going and simultaneously reveals. For those going to an island by themselves, stand by and whittle some ivory for 5 minutes whilst the others resolve their battles. And if you’re in a battle, it’s Clash Of The Gladiators where most sails = goes first, min(cannon, men) = numbers of dice to roll. Roll it out until someone decides to run away before their ship is decimated.

So, some ok fun, with some decent decision making on where to go and how to play the odds, but after that, prostrate thyself before the dice gods.

A pirate board game classic!  The standard to which all other pirate games are compared.  The secret selection of which island to sail to gives you something to think about (where are other going to go???).  The combat between players and legendary pirates adds tension and luck.  You have to balance the 4 areas of your ship so that you're ship is strong.  At the same time, you need to also make sure you're gaining fame (aka, victory points!).  The theme works well and you really get into it.  Lots of fun!

Generally a nice game with a strong theme. But if somebody gets a poor start - is beaten twice by others in the first two rounds - he will have a considerable disadvantage. In 80%-90% of our games this player was out of competition for the rest of the game, had no chance to win the game anymore. EDIT: Sold! :-)

Tried it once last night and I must say the game pieces are impressive. The board was beautifully done and the turns go by rather quickly. The parrots were a good laugh for they seem to give ships super powers. In all it was a good game except the board seemed a little too big especially when there is no acutal movement to be done. Wish the battle was bloodier =)

Fun game that ends up being very random because of simultaneous action selection.  I like how you can build up your ship throughout the game, and choose your strengths and such.  However, you just can't control if you're going to end up with someone else or not.  Also, not getting a parrot sucks.

Attractive components, worthy of a Day's of Wonder title.

Oct 2014: This game was really just not fun and had to go. Very random, there was one interesting mechanic and the rest was ultimately just fiddly moving colorful stuff around. Avoid.

RATING: 7
Generally, I enjoy this game.  The board and bits are very high quality, and the game captures the theme well.  My only gripe is that a run of bad luck at the beginning of the game (for example, if you pick the same islands as other people AND roll badly in the ship battles) will completely ruin your game by the halfway point, making for some very frustrating games.  But if you can avoid that pitfall, it's a fun, lighthearted game.

By the way, the "Pirates of the Spanish Main" ships work really well for this game, and look great!

I usually try to avoid fghting, beef up my ship, and then during the last turn, I take on the legendary pirate. Most of time I get I get sent limping away, although most of the time I can beat Captain Hook, it's those other ones that are nasty.

Pirate's Cove, Days of Wonder edition.  

Great game, I love that all combat is based on hidden player movement, so it's impossible to both turtle (avoid all combat) as well as to pick on any particular player.  Players can make educated guesses about where the other players are heading, but smart players will plan for this to throw off their opponents.  Components (as always with DoW) are fantastic, theme is perfect, the game moves along at a good pace and it's a lot of fun.

This game solves a lot of the pirate game problems. I like how quick the navigation phase is. I like how the combat phase works, forcing players to diversify their ship upgrades. I like how a greedy pirate can lose treasure if he waits too long to burry it on the island. I like how they worked in the neutral player famous pirates that provide a path for lots of fame or that prevent players from grabbing easy treasures on the islands with the fat treasure cards. 

I like that the game is fast and simple. The hardest part was remembering to take hits on the craftsmen and parrots. My only small quibble is that the parrots are too powerful, but that can be easily tweaked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It sure is heavily luck-dependant. Luck is involved in almost everything: when putting your ship, when battling, when drawing cards(who would have guessed), when deciding which parts to upgrade.
I should be liking the system of upgrades, I love when there is lots of character(ship)-improvement in game, but it feels as if it really didn't matter. They all can become meaningless in one attack. 

Although definitely it's a plus that "loots" from every island (varying every turn) are rather large, so it feels you get a lot of options to do on your next turn.
(I have played the older version only.)

Enjoyment varies with number of players. Better with 4 or more players. A lot of rounds, but moves quickly. A huge amount of player interaction due to ship battles. Only real downtime is watching two players duel, but these tend to be short and fierce and everyone has a vested interest in the outcome, so keeps things interesting. Seems complicated, but players pick it up after about two turns. Several possible strategies, beautiful components, and very basic "level up" mechanic. Some flaws are the parrot card mechanic, which seems strange and tacked on, plus the heavy reliance on dice to determine outcomes of battles (which can even the playing field between very young players and adults, but can be frustrating). Also, once you fall behind, can be very difficult to catch up. A clear winner can usually be identified about mid game, which can lead to player collusion and conflict. Can become very cutthroat, which plays into the theme, but can be upsetting to some.

Okay pirate themed game -- you're mostly searching for treasure and having a battle or two along the way. The components for the game are really nice and add to the theme. Overall the game is a little too long and a bit repetitive, especially if you manage to avoid battles for a few turns in a row.

I need to find something that is between this and Blackbead, difficulty wise.

On the other hand, my 7-year-old nephew declared this the best game ever (I modified some rules to make it easier for him and shorter for me.) It endears the game to me a little more, since he likes it better than The Game of Life.

Has the stone-paper-scissors element of Adel Verpflichtet, a dash of the chaotic/luckfesty combat system similar to Age of Myth, and the luck of the draw on the tavern cards.  

There I am, sailing along, staying near the front.  Sure, my ship may not be the best and I've lost several battles already, but I've got tavern cards enough to tip the scales of any battle in my favor, and I do roll 4 dice for combat.  Ah, yes, the big battle!  I'll play Smokescreen, and Grapeshot attack, and hope my ship can survive.  I rolled...1, 1, 2, 6.  What?!?!  And he rolled...two sixes!?!?  So all my carefully hedged bets are blowing up in my face!?!?

Note to self: don't play dice games.

One of the best-themed pirate games I've come across as it is full of narrative elements. Needs the full complement of 5 to provide tense competition. However, I find 12 rounds too long and repetitive, and I wish the combat was as streamlined as Knizia's Gladiators (as I'm not the type of player willing to be a spectator of 2 other players fighting it out). Now have the Pirate's Cove edition.

This game is fun to play and is one of the best if you are looking for strong theme in a game, especially if you like the subject of pirates. However, because of the heavy dice rolling and the cards, it is rather weak in depth and not in the same class as the more strategical games such as The Princes of Florence, St. Petersburg, San Juan, etc.

RATING: 3
Played once and everyone agreed that it just wasn't very fun.  Planning a long term strategy seemed undoable.  Everyone's playing for the current turn and if you are damaged in the early going then it is very hard (impossible?) to recover.

Update, played several more times and it is very random.  There is little difference between this and rock, paper, scissors.  Dropped rating.

Probably this is a kids game and would work well in that context.

Components are very, very good.

Love this game.  Fun, easy to play, works well and has a great theme.

We added grid lines for movement to make it even more enjoyable.  Now we can use movement to get to the islands instead of just going there.  Plus, the bad pirate and the Royal Navy can hunt you down.  So adding this and a few rules made it an excellent and easy to play game. 

Lots of variety and ways to play the game too.  For all ages.

Not for me. I found the game to be far too lucky--mostly you wanted to not select a location your opponents did. The first few who wound up engaging each other almost always would go on to lose as they would be behind the other players in terms of ship strength. Overall the game just doesn't seem to have any way to reward good play, and so it mostly just felt like playing an hour long game and seeing who got lucky to win.

Pirate's Cove is a game that somehow hearkens back to the cool Milton Bradley games of the 70's.  Yet it is so much deeper and richer of a game experience.  Despite having the elements of a deep strategy game, it somehow manages not to bog down upon itself.    It maintains a fun lightness that determines not to take itself too seriously.  The result is a fun midweight game that everyone can enjoy.   It draws upon its theme with a universal appeal and has everyone going with the spirit of "ho, ho, ho and a bottle of rum".   Our group hasn't figured out the black pirate's yet so we typically avoid them during the course of the game because they seem too powerful.  This lessens what is otherwise a great, fun-filled game experience.  But hey, that's just us.

Un gioco semplice, colorato, veloce e frizzante, ma abbastanza fortunoso, in linea con altri prodotti della Days of Wonder. L'ambientazione piratesca è ben resa e divertente. Simultaneamente si agisce cercando di non fare le stesse azioni dei tuoi "Amici Pirati" altrimenti si finisce a... Cannonate! (alcuni scontri risulteranno epici) perchè solo uno, il vincitore dello scontro, può compiere l'azione che desidera. Poi c'è chi, da Buon Pirata, vuole andarsela a cercare... volendo sconfiggere la nave del Pirata Leggendario (tipo Barbanera), ma è... quasi sempre un suicidio! Giocato con lo spirito giusto, tipo caciara e confusione, è perfetto per una serata leggera (ma neanche troppo) e allegra, per ridersela alla grande impersonando pirati strampalati e lanciandosi in epiche battaglie navali (specialmente se si è rimasti indietro sulla scala del punteggio)... Hahaha.

RATING: 5
Bit of a miss for me. I enjoy the strategy of collecting resources and placing your ship, but the pirate battles were just too random and relied heavily on dice. Sails the same? roll a dice to see who goes first. Now roll dice to see if you hit. Then they roll dice if they hit. This goes back and forth until someone forfeits or someone is knocked out. Even the cards you get for being knocked out or buy are random. Game board also doesn't scale with number of players. I did like the theme and while I didn't care for the battle, I thought it fit the theme pretty well. I just think it would've been better if battle had been implemented differently. 

Overall I gave it a 5. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. I would consider playing again but I'd probably prefer playing something else.

RATING: 5
this game is beautiful to look at and highly thematic. the game also manages to be a good bit of fun. however, the game play is pretty flawed. with a full compliment of players, one or two players will be knocked out of contention in the first few rounds through no real fault of their own. it's possible to crawl your way back if you get somewhat lucky and by some miracle manage to outwit all the other players for the rest of the game, but realistically the chances of a player in a losing position, even if early in the game, pulling off a win are slim. especially since other players can just gang up on the weaker players for easy fame points. so if you can overlook that fact that you might not get to do much of anything for an hour and a half, this game can be a decent option for a group looking to play a party game and that is tired of the usual party game fare.

A-harrr, me hearties!

Sail the islands of Pirates Cove to gain the best treasure, gold, or fame. But be prepared to fight for it.
Improve your ships abilities to make it strong. Or will you be crippled in battle & limp off defeated to make minimum repairs.
Or do you dare challenge the Legendary Pirate for more fame points?

Good dice-rolling fun if not taken too seriously. 
All chant with me, "Kill the parrot! Kill the parrot!"

I like the idea of pirate themed games (although none to date have thrilled me).  I enjoy playing this game, but it just seems like it could have been so much better.  It can be quite exasperating when everyone else gets to the island they selected and you keep picking the same island one other ship is picking.  If you lose once, it can cause a cascade effect where one player is just taken out of the game early on.  

Also, some of the parrots are comicly overpowered, and can really imbalance the game as well.

Hmm. Need to play this more, I suppose... but I wasn't bowled over upon my introduction. Less complex than complicated, and a lot less interaction than I had hoped for. We'll see how it improves with successive plays.

Pirate's Cove.  High Quality bits - period!  Fun factor is high and I would put this on the high end of games that a nongamer would play.  Figuring where to sail each turn is always tense, as everyone secretly picks which island to plunder at the same time.  Conflict arises, cannons are fired with dice, and ships are sent back to pirate's cove for free repairs.  Our battles are usually tense, but those black ships tend to be a mixed bag in our group.  Otherwise I would give this game a higher rating.  The luck can be a pain at times, but its decently balanced with plenty of other strategy.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 3
I prefer Key Largo to this because it's more stripped down. This is the game that made me realize what I like and hate in games -- I like reading a rule book and knowing all the situations that can come up later, and I hate having a stack of cards that does nothing but create exceptions to those situations. (This is why I class Flux and Dominion as the same type of game -- they're both nothing BUT stacks of cards of exceptions.) I see how this would appeal to programmer types, but it drives me crazy.

In this game, a parrot gives your ship special powers. Just like in real life.

Here be a real piratical game, me hearties!  You get to build up your pirate ship so that you are best able to collect treasure and fight off your opponents and the dread legendary pirates who roam the seas.  I enjoy the psychology of trying to outguess which islands your opponents will choose to visit each turn even if I'm not very good at it.  And you get to fire your cannons and fight at sea.  Lovely components and works well with the theme.

Got it free with a 2for1 deal from Days of Wonder when I bought Mystery Express. My two younger kids (6 and 8) LOVE this game. I admit that it's merely OK but I usually dread playing it. Why? Well, the choices in the game aren't really choices - they're obvious. And something about mechanics and rules that discourage combat makes no sense given the theme. Also, I tend to find that this game severely suffers from runaway leader syndrome. One person makes some lucky die rolls and if they capitalize on winning a big battle, go on to dominate the rest of the game.

I prefer this with the variant that a die is rolled to determine the famous pirate's location after everyone has chosen their destination. Why would a fearsome corsair be so predictable?

There's no doubt that this dice-fest is fun and highly thematic. There's a few fiddly rules, such as the order of firing when players, Blackbeard and the Royal Navy find themselves in a pileup. But overall, it's fairly easy to teach and nicely combines a few time-tested mechanisms, such as simultaneous action selection and hit points that disable specific parts of your ship.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

All around fun game, even plays great with a variant for 2 players. Love the theme and of course it's top notch quality. If you like plundering gold and fighting your opponent to get rich, you will like this game.  Thumbs up!!

Very much a game of Risk on water with a predetermined number of rounds (too many, 8 rather than 12 would make the game a little less painful). As in Risk, the player who avoids confrontation the most successfully in the first part of the game and grabs the odd VP here and there without brilliance has the upper hand. Tip: don't bother with chests and spend all your money on upgrades, and flee as soon as the odds don't look good.

This game is a complete blast.  The first time I played it, we had so much fun.

Large luck component, very much a dice fest, but still a fun game.  English translations here on the geek are very helpful. I've played with three and four players so far, and I think it works fine with either.  My only complaint is the game seems to favor avoiding combat for the majority of the game, so too much time is spent upgrading the ship and not enough time fighting.  May need to invent some house rules to address this.

Arrrgghhh!  Gotta love playing a pirate.  Only problem I had was the possibility of getting hammered every turn if you destination choices keep getting picked by others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
At least with 5 players, it seemed way too random.  The lucky players who don't pick the same destination as other players get a nice advantage.  Once a couple players get damaged in combat, it is hard for them to reequip.  We had several with damaged cannons, so they always lost in combat to the stronger opponents, and could never get their cannons high again.

If you want a pirate game, I recommend [gameid=22287] or (less explicitly about pirates) [gameid=826].

Pirates cove is a fairly popular game where each person plays a pirate trying to gather as much booty as possible for points.  They do this by traveling to the different islands that specialize in different things.  Players choose in secret where they will go and if multiple players choose the same location, battles ensue, which could cause you to lose any treasure you have on board. 

Pros: Fairly fast game play.  Beautiful artwork and components. Fun individual boards for upgrading your ship.  

Cons:not many options on what to do on your turn.  No deep decision making. Not a very strong theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This started out as a fairly successful gateway game. I enjoyed my earlier plays fairly well. As time and more plays have passed, I have less enthusiasm and appreciation for this game. What I don't like:

:d10-1: It's actually fairly complicated for a gateway game. The difference between volley and battle cards in particular are difficult for new gamers to grasp. It slows down the game and frustrates new players when I have to correct their card play during battles. It's not that complicated, except to new gamers, which is what this game seems to be designed/marketed for.

:d10-2: One of the best strategies is to avoid combat early on, if not for the whole game. There is little incentive to seek battle unless you have an overwhelming advantage over other players. The consequences for losing are severe and often beget a pattern of failure throughout the game. This gives gameplay a game long anti-climatic feel. It just doesn't feel right. This game really suffers from run away leader syndrome.

:d10-3: Legendary Pirates. I've rarely ever wanted to attack a pirate by myself, and certainly not until the last turn of the game if I do. All the Legendary Pirates seem to do is knock one island out of contention every turn. Sure it makes the remaining 5 islands more competitive and forces confrontation, but who wants that with :d10-2: in mind? You might as well substitute a "thou shall not use this island" card for the Legendary Pirate ship throughout the game. I also don't like that the Legendary Pirate moves in a predictable pattern.

:d10-4: I love and need luck in my games. However, I also need strategy or some kind of process that begets mental exercise. This game delivers far too much luck and little opportunity for players to develop strategy. Because there is really no strategy.

:d10-5: It tries to be a bluffing game since only one player can reap the benefits of an island each turn and movement is simultaneous and hidden. But this feeds into the whole conflict avoidance theme because you don't want to fight anyone over an island (usually). But there's not much to bluff with, outside of your few tavern cards because the strength of your ship is on display for everyone to see.

:d10-6: There's no long term replayability here for me. It's fine as a gateway game, except the new gamers always have a problem utilizing the tavern cards successfully. This leads to frustration. By the time a player has a good understanding of the rules (usually only a few games in), they see that there is not much depth to the game. It's extremely luck based off the outcome of the first round. So by the time a player has a comfortable understanding of the game, they have often lost interest in playing the game further.

What I like:
:d10-1: The theme is fun and the components are nice. It's an attractive gateway game.

:d10-2: New players have responded fairly well to the game initially. 

:d10-3: It opens up the opportunity for a lot of trash talk and light hearted banter.

:d10-4: You get to kill other people's parrots!

I think the type of gamer I'd most strongly recommend this game to is a group who likes light weight games and prefers a fun social experience over heavy strategical based competition.

Great theme, good artwork, and nice components. That said, the game isn't much of a game. Chance plays far too prevalent a role, so it rarely feels like any "choice" in this game really matters. The simultaneous action selection (a mechanic I really like in most other games) only makes this game even more chaotic. Rarely did I feel like there was any opportunity for meaningful strategic (or even tactical) play. Strange card imbalances also mar this game. Frustration with the mechanics made this one hard to enjoy even as a light theme-heavy game.

I loved this game from Days of Wonder at first, but then after a few bad games I don't love it so much.  This game has a tendency to kick a player when he's down.

This game is easy to learn and can be really fun to play, but it can be really frustrating as well.

It's like someone went into my head and created a pirate game that would appeal to me more than it would for anyone else. This is a blast of a game, filled with double-guessing and wild swings in fortune.

Definitely one of Days of Wonder's best games.

After two frustrating games (and much thought) I played again and enjoyed the game a lot more. It is very easy to get caught up in trying to make a long term plan and trying to build up your ship.

Do not mistake this for a heavy game; as family fin it's great!

Alternant entre double guessing, lancé de pelletées de dés, et tirages de cartes, ce jeu est à 95% un pur jeu de hasard. Couplé avec le thème de pirates plutôt réussi, cela pourrait être un bon jeu d'ambiance, si ça n'était pas si long et si compliqué…

Le jeu dure pas loin de deux heures, et l'ambiance finit bien vite par retomber, le temps de plonger dans la règle pour analyser le fonctionnement d'une des nombreuses cartes action pas très claires, ou de subir une fois de trop un mauvais tirage de dés anéantissant tout espoir de victoire…

Au bout de quelques parties, on connaît assez les règles pour que le jeu s'accélère un peu, mais c'est aussi le moment où la répétitivité du jeu entraîne une profonde lassitude, et le jeu rejoint le fond de l'armoire pour ne plus en ressortir.

Récemment, un autre jeu de pirates basés sur les dés a fait son apparition : [gameid=19948] de Stephan Feld chez Alea et à mon avis bien plus réussi...

RATING: 8
Players take on the roles of minor pirates vying for fame in a given calendar year.  Players choose an island to move to, in secret, then simultaneously reveal their destination.  Only one pirate can be at an island, so any that chose the same one will be thrust into combat!  There is quite a bit of strategy picking your islands, for each allow you to upgrade only one aspect of your ship (or bury your treasure for victory points).  Not only must you plan your route but you must also figure out if anyone else might choose your island and whether or not you can defeat them.

Must play with five, or else there&#039;s not enough interaction. Rules are a little fiddly. A short version with only six rounds is more fun for beginners - players begin with double the normal gold to build their ship, four cards, and also five treasure chests. I believe there&#039;s more strategy than people are giving it credit for. Dice rolls and drawing of cards lead you to alter your strategy, they&#039;re not normally game makers or breakers. Cards are reasonably well balanced. Can be fun if players get into the theme and stop worrying about dice rolls. Played it five times and the same player won each time, so I&#039;m not at all convinced it&#039;s all about the luck of the dice rolls or card draws - there must be some strategy in there somewhere. Unfortunately other players don&#039;t seem to agree with me, so it loses a rating point as a result - games always seem to end with dissatisfied gamers.

RATING: 7
Acquired by trade for playing with a group of wargamers and non-wargamers. Great fun for a group who eschews brain burning strategic depth.  It is true, much of the time the winner is the one who can avoid most of the combat but that was the way of real pirates. Where the "piratey" aspect falls dramatically short is the best way to gain booty and fame is by sacking ports. There is only one randomly drawn merchant ship in the whole game, the Cacafuego. Bartholomew Roberts took over 400 merchant ships in two years! My minor beef and I always have one, is the map and the five player cards are awkward to arrange on a standard USA card table. The player mats could have been laid out smaller if the cartoonish artwork had been less dominant.

As far as I can tell, playing by the standard rules makes this game broken. Unless a variant is used to resolve lost combat. The people who lose their combat, will continue to lose combat through out the game.

I'm not particularly a big fan of pirates, but I have to admit I really got a kick out of buckling some swashes with this game.  Best themed game to come out in 2003, hands down.  Can be a little chaotic but leaves plenty of options for staging a comeback.  Don't let anybody spend too much time in the tavern!

Yeah, it's a pretty fluffy dice fest, and potentially broken with some of the parrot cards.  But it looks great, has great bits, and just oozes theme and flavor.  But I always ask myself one question: Was it fun?  You bethcha!

2012 Anniversary gift for Zack from Julia

This is a fun thematic adventure game from Days of Wonder.  The components are head of the class and the way that this game can appeal to Risk junkies with its dice combat system and RPG video gamers with its upgradable player powers using the ship player boards is uncanny.  I like the simultaneous secret player selection mechanic and the bluffing and swashbuckling press-your-luck feel to this game.  I also like that has a finite duration of 12 rounds which demands a significant long term strategy for victory, but victory points can be acquired in several different ways from winning cannon battles, to seizing unchallenged treasures, to drawing advantageous tavern cards, to pick up and delivery of pirate booty.  You can play this game several times using totally different tactics as either an aggressive buccaneer or a shrewd and cautious cowardly privateer.  Though not required, I recommend players voice a hearty AHOY, Avast, and ARRRRGHH as they play the part of their respective pirates. A fun gateway pirate game for my family at this time and is a one of a kind selection in our growing collection.

I picked up a German copy of this off of the BGG marketplace and was very happy with the purchase.  As mentioned elsewhere, the blind decision type of mechanisms do not generally sit well with me.  In fact, in this game they can sometimes get on my nerves.  However, it does fit well with the theme.  After all, it's not like they had GPS signals on their ships back then.  At any rate, there is certainly more room for strategy in this game than msny seem to want to give it credit for.

Great theme game from Days of Wonder.  Basic game play is pretty straight forward, but there are a ton of little rules that can take a while to get the hang of.  

Game moves fairly quickly even with 5 or 6 players and even first time players shouldn't have a problem quickly figuring out how to maximize their score.  This is going to get a ton more plays in the future in our group.

[1 play] Very strong pirate theme and excellent quality production by Days of Wonder. Game play is interesting but very random. Do not expect deep or strategic gameplay - this is a light party game themed up as a pirate wargame.

A fun (or infuriating) game with beautiful components. Unfortunately, the unpredictable movement, random cards and dice combine for an extremely high luck factor.

What a fun pirate game! Rule complexity is about that of Puerto Rico - although the game play itself doesn't much resemble Puerto Rice. Pirate's Cove fits the bill as a super "beer and pretzels" kind of game. The blind destination mechanic introduces a great feeling of tension as players try to guess where their opponents' are heading so that they can be avoided - or battled with. The combat is quick and rolling the bones just seems very apropos in a pirate game. Look forward to future plays.

A fun game with a great components. Not a great game though, or two main reasons... firstly, you spend your entire time running away from combat because it's too hard to recover from getting pasted. Secondly, it annoys me that although it looks like a really simple game that's almost kid level, there are tons of little rules and exceptions! I can tolerate that in Arkham Horror but not in a kiddy game about pirates.

A game which everyone in the family seems to enjoy, except me!  I find it to be "all flash and no dash."  Great looking board and bits, but the gameplay involves almost no tactical decision making.  The loser of the first ship to ship battle is generally out of the game and there are a bunch of combat cards that never get used.<BR><BR>I boycott the game whenever it is suggested, but still end up playing it once in awhile, just to keep the youngsters happy.<BR><BR>Update: I played this game again last week.  I won every battle, my ship was maximally upgraded, I took out two Pirate Ships in my last three turns and I never once went to Tavern Island for upgrade cards or Parrots.  I lost by 3 points to someone that I had beaten in battle three times because he got lots of Tavern VP cards.  Yuck!  Hope that I don't have to play again for another 6 months!

Played once with my wife and in-laws.  I just didn't get it.  The core of the game seemed to revolve around dodging conflict to make it to islands alone and not battle other players or the dread pirate.  Additionally, I found the rules ambigous as to whether the Royal Navy are condsidered a dread pirate, or if they're independent and only crop up when someone plays the Royal Navy card.  Perhaps additional plays will make me like it more, but I'm not clamoring to get it to the table.  But the bits are nice.

This is a game with very well developed intrigue: there's something going on almost all the time, you see what happens with everybody else, and you have to make some compromises all the time, too. It is kinda clear that in the end everybody needs to get to the island to fight the legendary pirate who happen to be there on turn 12, but occasionally I was able to win by dumping my chests a turn before, and watch everybody else die in a fight against the Flying Dutchman :))

The theme carries this one. The bits are very nice (in both the German and American editions), and the action moves along quickly once everyone realizes that pirates are not deep thinkers. There's not a lot of strategy involved, but with more games under my belt I'm beginning to see more interesting tactical choices. 3 players don't provide quite enough interaction; 4 or 5 is better. The new edition makes many changes which enhance and clarify play without taking away any of the original flavor.

Now here's a game that you play if you want to have fun.  Get into the theme and roll those dice.  Fun light strategy mayhem.  A lot of luck, but it doesn't bother me in the least because I was having a good time.  *Update* - played with an older more experienced crowd and found out what the fuss was all about.  After that session I'm a solid fan of Pirate's Cove -- it was tense and exciting the whole time.  Plus, we played with five players, which is certainly an upgrade over three. *Update* - things have changed quite a bit in the last four years.  I now consider this one just okay.  Fun every once and a while but it's showing its age and not holding up in my opinion.

I hesitate to say I'd never turn down a game of Pirate's Cove, as I often am looking for something much weightier -- but so far as light boardgames go, this is one of my very favourites.  Anything that results in a lot of pirate-talk is a good thing in my book.  It's reasonably fast, has some strategy, is gorgeous to look at, and is a lot of fun to play.  All in all a winner.

Wanted to buy after my first play.  A fun theme and pretty good interaction with the simultaneous selection mechanic and fighting.  However, upon playing for the second time, the game takes too long and the rules are way too fiddly for such a luck-based offering.  Update:  played again and the game took nearly three painfully boring hours.  Looks pretty, but there's no substance (insert your own joke).  I don't want to ever play it again.

Good fun game. Fairly luck based. But you can still 'form strategies' in your mind. And doesn't get bogged down in one players decision. Good environment for role playing and getting really into it.

RATING: 10
This is one of those few strategic games that EVERYONE I teach how to play, both girls and boys alike, love just as much. While there is some luck involved this game uses heavy strategy and lots of different ways to go about it. The bright flamboyant colors and swashbuckling adventures with your game modified pirate ships become really epic and interesting. this is one of the most unique and well made games you will ever find. a sure hit. cannons away.

RATING: 6
Pretty neat at first, but I lost interest after a few games. There seems little reward for upgrading your ship, rather the winning strategy seems to be to avoid combat and crew/cannon upgrades, and instead just dump treasure/gold as often as possible.

Excellent game components, nice to handle and look at, but with only one viable path to victory, I eventually sold my copy off.

After my first play, I was quite disappointed with this game.  It simply wasn't the definitive, "sailing the high seas in search of adventure", pirate game that I was looking for.  However over time I have come to appreciate it for what it is - a light-hearted and fun experience - and it has become one of my favourite "light Euro" games.  As is to be expected, Days of Wonder has done a bang-up job with the physical components (even the backs of the cards are gorgeous).  It's certainly not a perfect game (I've had to add a few tweaks: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/283054), and I don't think it would play very well with anything except 4 or 5 players, although there is a decent 2-player variant out there - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30050 - (it's too bad they didn't make it playable with 6!), but those 4 or 5 players are quite likely to have an enjoyable time if they get into the theme and don't take the game too seriously.  But enough of the chit-chat Me Hearties! I've got a leg to peg, an eye patch to snatch, a ship to equip, a village to pillage, a governor's daughter to slaughter, a cup o' rum to put in me tum, some Pieces of Eight to appropriate, and a guy with a black spot that needs to be shot. Arrrr!!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

People seem to be very divided on this game.  Some love it because of the cool board and the combat with other players.  Others hate it because they say the game is too chaotic and repetitive.  I like this game primarily because you can selectively improve your ship and the penalty for running from a fight is relatively minor.  Thus you don't have to fight until you are ready.  This mitigates some of the bad luck others complain about and makes the game more strategic in my opinion.  There is also the meta-game of trying to figure out where others will choose to go and then making a good decision for yourself based on that information.  For instance, if another player's ship is particularly vulnerable, then you want to go where they are so you can fight them.  Also you know where the pirate ships are going so avoiding them is easy until you are ready to take them on.  Overall a fun game that does have luck but there is strategy in there as well, you just have to look for it.

RATING: 7
[Day of Wonder 03 edition] {Pirate; dice-rolling, simultaneous action; optimal 5p} PC is an attractive gateway game. It's welcome by my friends because the game time is right, the bits are attractive, it is fun and dynamic. Besides, players are happy to see that their ships grow stronger. It has strong pirate theme and nice player interaction.

PC is quite chaotic and luck dependent. Hardcore gamers may despise it for the lack of control. The fun of PC heavily depends on the mentality of players. It would be very fun with aggressive players but it will be dull if all players are playing defensively to avoid confrontation and fights.

The illustration of the game is colorful and pretty. The ships are quite sturdy. However, the player mats too thin. I prefer large coins, too! (I should buy some pirate coins in future.) 

[Rulebook] DoW has updated the rulebook at 2004.  It has clearer rules about Royal Blue and other stuffs.  Download it to have a look.

I liked the thematics and the fun mechanics, but felt there was too much randomness involved. A lot depends on your dice rolling, which cards you draw, and if you happen to pick the same island as other players. My biggest complaint was the difficulty in catching up once your ship is destroyed once (which happens fairly frequently).

Overproduced, and you pay for it.  Am starting to believe that "theme" is something added to games which are so abstract that their play mechanism has no similarity to any real-life activity.  Such as movement, which in this game means teleportation.  Or combat, which here means that the ship with the lowest statistic on either sail, cannon, crew, or hull may as well just give up unless they have a wild card.  Cartagena is a worse offender than this, but that's not saying much.

[UPDATE after 5 years of playing the game] Game after game after game I've played this with my kids and they keep loving it. And surprisingly, so do I. It just keeps being interesting and it is always great if we find time to play a quick game of it. FUN and cheers, and amazing wins from hopeless situations, we've seen them all.

We play with the 'random pirate' variant: so after everyone has revealed their navigation disc, one player rolls where the legendary pirate will show up, except for the last turn, where the pirate will always go to Treasure Island. The tension each turn (and the groans of those visited) is amazing, and each turn you have some people cheering at the table. It has the exact right amount of luck, strategy, interaction and hidden bonus points. In a visual attractive package for an accessible price.

This game beats even Small World and Ticket to Ride as to be the perfect family game. Get it.

It should be understood that I rate the games I own based on how well they are accepted by the crowd I play with.  I often do a lot of research in hopes of finding a game that can appeal to a group that has a very broad range of likes and dislikes.

I had hopes for this game, however 2 of the 4 players were the recipients of many bad die rolls and came away with a very bitter taste in thier mouths.  A game (IMHO) needs to be fun enough that even if you lose, the players come away having completely enjoyed themselves.

Finally had the chance to play this with some people that were just out to blow away each others ships in lighthearted fun and I must say that makes it a lot more enjoyable.

A somewhat interesting game of bluffing and second-guessing your opponents' intentions, Pirate's Cove is something of a mix between a Euro game and an American dice fest. I found this at least somewhat enjoyable when it first came out, but now, 10 years later, after gathering dust in the shelf. I find that it doesn't appeal as it once did. I think game design has just come a long way since this was something that would be in my play rotation. Rating dropped from 6 to 5 and Pirate's Cove placed on trade pile.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played once with four players. Rules are a little more complicated than they need to be. The game play is fairly simple though. We played with a variant to randomize the movement of the Legendary Pirate to make it more likely that ships would end up on the same island and to encourage battle. We definitely had a few battles, which were pretty fun (except for the crippled ship owners). The Legendary Pirates seem pretty tough to beat, except for maybe in a last round battle. Maybe next time we will have more courage and attack him. Beautiful components and simple enough game play for anybody to understand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For being a "lighter" game, it's a little complex to teach and longer to play then you would expect.  We almost never pull it out because of the two reasons above.  Beyond that it is really a pretty good game.  Primarily this game comes down to being able to accurately determine where your opponents will play.  He/she who does that best will be right near the top of the scoring track.

RATING: 7
Pirate's Cove may be the quintessential pirate game.  All of the thematic elements are present, but more importantly, so is the fun.  This is a swashbucking, action-oriented experience that the family can grasp quickly.  Dice battles flare up with the perfect frequency and they're simple and exciting.

RATING: 8
Chaotic enough that it will make you chuck your pegleg through the nearest window every few plays. Don't play this one with peacelovers, as the more players you add the more blood will get spilled into the water.

The first pirate-themed game as well as the first simultaneous action game I've played. The simultaneous action mechanic was a novel one for me and keeps players engaged throughout the game, as there is little to no significant down-time. Combat is dice-driven, which can at times be frustrating if the die have no appreciation for your grand strategy. Much of said strategy (and fun!) involves analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the ships of your fellow Pirates, attempting to guess their desired destinations and planning your destination accordingly. The only downside I've found is that if someone happens to have a weak ship and is unable to avoid combat on a recurring basis early in the game, it's easy for them to get frustrated.

A nice fun pirate themed game. I enjoy the feel of building up your ship and planning out your missions.

A highly thematic game that seems a bit unbalanced in terms of fun/hour. 

It's still a good experience, and the pirate theme works well. Home, minor rules can tweak the game towards anyone's liking. Simultaneous destination selection is half the game and it rocks!

With the normal rules, the game ends too soon and one bad early combat can put you out of the game from the start. With the addition of simple home rules (no treasure cards discarded, double vp from combating pirates, varying vp awards in combat based on players relative position) we were able to make the game quite more strategic and competitive but it now drags the full 90mins, touching 2h with 5or6p. That's a bit too much for me.

My overwhelming reaction to this game is indifference, tinged slightly with annoyance.  There just isn't much that stands out to actually like about this offering.  The possibility of losing a first round battle -- or worse, a battle for the first two rounds (which will be lost if you lose the first) -- and being essentially out of the running from there on out makes this really not my type of game.  In that way it reminds me of Citadels with a bunch of added chrome and some dice rolling.

Its neat hour long game.  If I could only find my eyepatch, I think I'd like it more.  But its tough to find it with my pegleg.

Some decisions, I probably am underrating this, but my game group doesn't care for it and I play other games so much more these days.  Probably a  once in awhile game, which is about the experience and not the strategy.  It doesnt over stay its welcome so its a six.

RATING: 8
This game is really fun.  I do enjoy playing it and doubt I'll ever turn down a game but at the same time probably won't be suggesting it much.  The game is hectic with 5 players, works best with 4 and is dull with 3.  The times I've won I feel it due more to luck as to what islands the other players went to in the beginning of the game.  The times I've lost well, luck again as there's really not much in the strategy dept. for this game. Still it's enjoyable and as with any Days of Wonder product super high quality. 

UPDATE:It took a lot for me to rate this game a 9.  It sat at a solid 8 for a long long time. Still I've been playing this game for years now and love to pull it out and give it a go.  I love to teach the game and to play it. I love the smaller variants that add flavor to the game and I love the base game.  This game deserves a 9. 

UPDATE: Played it again not too long ago and feel it needs a bit of dip. It's not feeling like a 9 anymore.

UPDATE: Brought this out again after a long  hiatus and was very glad I did. Still a very well built game and fun to play. Settling in at 8 is a good place for this one long term.

Ok light game, but the wife and kid like it. Best played when you get into the theme and have fun with it.
Just bought the game recently, and noticed some welcome rule changes (chance of mutiny for fleeing, lose points for losing parrot).  Good idea!

RATING: 3
Frustrating game in that you simultaneously and secretly choose where to go, and then all reveal together, so you can't try to fight someone and exact revenge on them no matter how hard you may try.  It's a neat concept, but a little rough around the edges.

I am not a fan of the fact that a player can just get pounded on the entire game by the chance of coming to the same island as a stronger player every round. The game was enjoyable, but it has some flaws.

RATING: 8
I love this game. It has a very different game play than anything else I have tried. Everyone goes at once so there is almost no downtime. Dice play a strong factor, but you can do things to negate some of the randomness. The only bad thing is that you are directly attacking the other players ships. For some reason this can lead to stronger tensions between players than other games. Not a good game for stressed people.

(1 play) There's a lot of luck in the Tavern deck and in the dice rolling, plus the somewhat bluffy nature of the island choice involved. So, I don't like the game as a strategy game. That said, it's a fine game with a bit of strategy and thinking involved, plus its dripping with Pirate theme, so -- fun to play the way we did it, with an 8-year-old boy. Hence the 6 rating -- good for specific circumstances, but with gamers, leave it in the box.

The game is pretty fun, but at its core is a Rock-paper-scissors mechanic, which I'm not so fond of in general.

This is a good game that even non-gamer would enjoy. The play is very simplistic, but learning can seem overwhelming to non-gamers because of the small details of each map area.

Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared Pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the Tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome Pirate of the High Seas!

Acquired Feb 2005. My gaming buddies like it more than I do, but I must say that I do enjoy playing it.  The only thing that bothers me is that avoiding combat is an easy way to get in the lead and it just seems wrong that a pirate game should reward a lack of conflict.

I've played this one a lot but it's not one of my favorites.  The only "strategy" I can come up with is to NOT visit the big treasure islands that everybody else is going to visit to avoid getting sunk... extremely counterproductive :)  Or to gamble that everybody else is thinking the same thing and just go for it.  Not my cup of tea.

I was really looking forward to playing this game, but it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. It is not that the game does not have its merits, it just drags on too long.

Dripping with theme indeed. Game play is good but not great. Runaway leader problem is prominent if one person can avoid battles all the way. Catching up is tough but not impossible. Anti-climatic ending if last round is spent burying treasure.

Beautiful game, but upon more plays, this game has serious flaws. The rich get richer issues are real and if you fall behind or get blasted, it is tough to catch up. Not as impressed anymore with this game. There is very little recourse for the first few round losers to catch up and it is an extremely frustrating experience having to go round after round of combat without much gain

Played once at Origins 04.  It was decently fun, but it never felt like I had any control over what happened.  Me and another guy just kept picking the same island and having to fight.  We were both sick of running into each other after the third or forth time, since nobody wins that way.

After additional plays, I have decided that this game just annoys me.  I can understand why people like the game, but I'm just not one of them.  I strongly recommend trying before buying, unless you are in love with the pirate theme and great pirate art.

This one is fun if you go into it knowing what you're getting. I like playing it with a few house rules (like doubling what the pirates are worth) to make it where avoiding combat isn't the best way to win. I won the fist game we played hands down because I only got in two fights the entire time. Still, in a fight a few bad rolls (or good ones for your opponent) can really change the game. I'm looking forward to trying the Bucaneer variant and seeing if that adds anything to the game (I really think that random pirate moving is a must).

This game, while beautiful to look at, is rather boring.  You try to outguess your fellow players to avoid combat while trying to beef up your ship and stay away from the roving pirate.

Being a pirate fan, I like the theme of this game, but it's one that I only care to play every now and then (say, maybe once a month, tops). I've had great success with this in party settings.

Quite disappointing. Lighthearted feel appeals to casual gamers, but there's no depth.  Once you're losing, it's VERY hard to catch up.  Fighting is strongly discouraged by the victory conditions, but often unavoidable.  Usually even the victor in a fight is significantly worse off.  Not very many decisions to be made.  This game rides on theme, and theme alone.  Nobody is ever going to make a good pirate game, I'm now convinced.

Yarr, this be a fun game of pirate traysure and high-seas combat!  Shiver me Timbers!

Though highly thematic, with the usual Days of Wonder high production values, the game loses a few points for having the same-time selection of location.  Unfortunately, battles can be unavoidable, and if you ever did want to do battle, it's tough to figure out how to get a certain opponent in your gunsights.  That said, battle somehow also plays too little a role in a game about piracy.  A good game, but a mixed bag at the same time.

2016-08-29 - Rating 4 -> 6.5. Like all DoW productions I've been exposed to, this one has great components! I think rulebook could have been written better with a simple flowchart or cheat sheet. Cartoony characters and theme. Gameplay is relatively fast and 5p games can finish in about 1hr. For me the game got more interesting after watching Black Sails! Other than that, my original "4" rating was for playing with gamers as there isn't much depth to it. However, if you are looking to spend some quality time with family and roll dice to see who beats the "Legendary Pirates", then this rates a good "6.5" for sure.

It seems difficult to catch back up to the leader unless you team up with another player. 8/27/11 It's been over 4 and a half years since I've played and I lowered my rating from 6 to 4.

Well themed with a beautiful board and nice components. Lots of luck but an interesting bluffing / guessing moment when choosing the island to visit. Some rules were a little vague. One nice feature is you can easily choose the length of play at the start by reducing the number of cards placed on the islands. Full points for fun.

I have the English version - Pirate's Cove. I bought this as a family game ove the holidays.  I guess the recent movie was some of the motivation for the purchase.  Anyway, it is a good family game that can be played across a wide range of ages.  Once you figure out the squares on the board have nothing to do with movement then it makes more sense.  Some of the rules are unclear but we just decided on an interpretation and moved on with the game.  The Days of Wonder website has a FAQ and some other things about the game that explains some of the rules.  You can even print out your own pirate cards along with some others.  Good overall family game.

Much simpler than the lengthy rules led me to believe. Nice and pirate-y, but clearly nothing to be taken seriously. And that's OK, but there's a sense of missed opportunity here.

I don't understand the decision to not have the LPs move semi-randomly; moving them at the end is so anti-thematic....

I recently started playing this again it is essentially  a pretty simple game of treasure grabbing with a simple "choose a place to be with and hope there is no-one there when you arrive" mechanic.  A simple light herated sortov game good for introductions I would say, Combat (which is quick) is hard to avoid so perhaps not for  very non competitive types but a worthy game i feel

This is a beautiful game with wonderful components.  That said, its pretty simple strategically and really targeted more for children.  Thus while the game leaves me a little unfullfilled... it usually captures the imagination of every child I introduce it to.

RATING: 5
Lots of people say it's great, and it certainly is good, but some unbalanced cards really annoy me.  That and in a couple other places, they made things dependent on luck when there was already plenty of luck in the game.  We probably just need to play it more for it to click.

Cute little game with a lot of theme... but it's an almost completely random affair. If you're lucky enough to be alone on a few islands, you win. That's pretty much it.
Combat is also a dicefest... Not fun at all.
To top it all, when the last few turns come around, it's pretty obvious that half the players don't stand a chance of winning. And the whole package lasts a good 90 minutes. Bleh.

RATING: 6
Great theme. Great board. Great art. Nice bits. 
The thing I don't like is the way combat works. Even if you win, your ship is likely going to be shot up. It just isn't worth the risk, so most players try to avoid combat whenever possible. Unfortunately this takes something away from the game. In a pirate game I want to see cannonballs flying and cutlasses slashing, but if you play it that way, you'll likely lose the game while the guy who always managed to pick an island no one else went to stocks up on loot and upgrades and walks away with the victory. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game, if a bit random. Probably best played as a long-ish filler. Plays easily and quickly, doesn't require an awful lot of intelligence. Good amusement if not brought out too often, methinks. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's common for a player to lose a battle early on and struggle to recover because they keep visiting the same port to get repairs and get into another battle against a stronger ship. A big flaw in a family game.

If you want a pirate themed family game I'd look at Jamaica or Black Fleet which are both excellent.

The following is from the original Piratenbucht:

Poor translation IMHO, (the section on cards doesn't correctly break out action/combat cards). Some of the more recent ones from Joe C. (The Quick Reference Cards in Word format) seem a bit clearer. My rating on this has just kept going up. It's a fun game, with quite a bit of luck, but there's strategy there. In spite of the luck, it's one of the highest rated games I've got, (I rate each play of any game for goodness in my game log).

Piratenbucht - Arrgh Matey!
Pirate's Cove - terrible

Choose your own strained metaphor for this lush "treatment":

Played once (with 5 players). Some interesting ideas and a nice production by Days of Wonder are the main good points of this game. Apart from that, the game is much too random for my tastes (important parts of your final score can depend on a single die roll).

A little disappointing, I also find it takes up unnecessary space with over sized player cards, in the end it has a merry go round feel as the legendary pirate does his circuit and everyone avoids him and tries to avoid each other its ok a game but I expected more

I played this once and only with 3 players but I would certainly play it again. It exhibits play mechanics I have not seen in one game before, so it will take a couple of games before a tree of strategies emerges in my mind. I also drew the Parrot that allowed you to hold onto as many treasure chests as you wanted very early in the game, so my game play was very much shaped by the one piece of good fortune. That allowed me to stay away from Treasure Island and collect treasure while my opponents were constantly going to TI.

I wish the deck was a little deeper.  The parrots seem a little bit too important and certain ones more than the others.  I almost wish there were more parrots and perhaps even one that only negated the effects of an enemy parrot for one battle.

If you're in a battle during the first couple rounds it is almost impossible to win, though you can continue to flail to the end.  This really reduces to a game of anticipation which I always lose.  Could maybe be improved with a bidding / intention mechanic.

Stellar components, but lackluster (and to be honest, disappointing) gameplay. Whoever is best at outguessing his opponents, or merely gets lucky and finds himself alone at a location, gets an enormous benefit. Conflict is downright deadly for all those involved, and for a pirate game, there's very little piratey things going on. I never felt like my decisions were important, and did not enjoy myself -- I don't need to play this one again.

I give this game an 8 with the following rule changes:1) The parrots are taken out of the deck, and reshuffled into the bottom half of the deck so no one gets this huge advantage early in the game2) When you are sunk, you get to repair for free and get 2 cards (or a card and the gold) thus mitigating the huge loss of not getting to collect for the island you failed to exploreA good game with a slight bit too much luck to make it a 9 or a 10 but a lot of fun nonetheless.

I've read criticism that the key to the game is about 'avoiding the other players' and that makes it boring. Those reviews don't seem to account for the fact that people love fighting each other with pirate ships. Lots of fun, while there is some 'avoidance' issues it still makes for a great game.

I didn't really like this game the first time I played it, but it has grown on me.  I really like the way the different mechanisms are used.  The theme is fun too.

My complaints:

1) It takes too long. 
 
2) No official two-player variant.  My wife and I have tried making our own, but it didn't work too well.  We'll either tweak it or try some of the variants here on the geek.

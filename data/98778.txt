Rating based on two plays.
My group doesn't particularly like coops. But this one won us over in a single game.
The hidden information of your own hand also makes the solo player problem of coops go away.

A couple more plays and this feels like the best coop I've played.

A great take on set collection. It's a subtle coop that is less prone to quarterbacking. Best played with people you know well, or many games in a row so everyone works on the same subtle language (and sadly susceptible to bending the rules on what you can communicate).

Just a few games in and I'm ready for more.  An interesting coop game that is simple enough for young-ins to understand, but complex enough for gamers to strategize.  A decent amount of luck, but that is offset by the pride felt when filling the skies with fireworks. Recommend!

Great game. This one is very easy to learn, but hard to master. I feel as though achieving 25 may be impossible!

Update: Have mastered the game, often get 24-25, and I still find it fun!

Play it with my girlfriend a lot online. We often get 24 or 25. I decorated a box for her and got her a copy of the game for christmas! It keeps us together, and it will have a special place in my heart for that.

I've never seen people actually enjoy Hanabi while it is played. Everyone is quiet, nervous, angry at themselves when they make a mistake and angry at others when someone else makes a mistake.

A memory test. Doesn't play creatively.
The theme makes no sense. 
I primarily play boardgames to socialize, and Hanabi requires silence.

I LOVE this game! My FLGS recommended this to me, and I cannot thank them enough. Every person I have taught this to has loved it, and wanted to play repeat rounds and/or buy it themselves.

Antoine Bauza is quickly becoming a favourite designer of mine, and Hanabi just demonstrates his innovative game play so well that it is one of my most-played games.

I've always enjoyed Hanabi, but it's taken awhile for me to really warm up to it. It's still never been one of my favorites, but I think I can appreciate this tense, collaborative game on its own terms. 

You and all the other players are trying to lay down all the cards 1-5 in five different colors on the table. You're trying to do it before you run out of cards to draw or before you use up your three mistakes. Only catch? You're the only one that can't see your own hand. Everyone holds their hands outwards, and throughout the game you must use turns to give hints to other players. Based on the info they get from hints, they assemble some knowledge of their own hands and can play the proper cards on the table.

Though this is described as a group game, I actually prefer it two-player with my wife. We're still shockingly horrible at it (our best score is an 18 or 19) and may never beat it. With two player, you have fewer cards 'safe' in players hands so it's much more likely you discard a necessary card than when you play with more players. 

You can control how hard this game is by how strict you are about hints and passing on information -- my wife is always trying to sneak in extra information in her hints. Many people like to play this as a perfect information game (they write down every time they receive a hint, for example), but I think that detracts from the fun of it.

The fun is not in the logic puzzle, but in the logic puzzle combined with a few fallible human brains -- now that's a game I can get behind! There are few co-op games that are more unique or more engaging than Hanabi -- this is great fun in a tiny package, well worth the $10 it goes for! The brain burning puzzle exercises your brain nicely.

Custom-made.  Hanabi is the Japanese word for "firework," but it literally translates to "fire flower."  So I drew some flowers that look like they were made with fire, and printed them onto cards.  Kudos to the designers of this game for one of the most novel mechanics I've seen in board games.  Since there are limits on how you can communicate in this game, it's best played with people who aren't hell-bent on winning, but rather who want to have fun while they play.

Co-op.  The selling point of this game is the unique limited knowledge element, where everybody can see your hand except you.  It's a bit of a gimmick, and really just an okay game that requires players to agree on a strict set of rules (and have a good memory) to have any chance of winning.

Ever since the first time I played Hanabi I have played many other card games with cards flipped. What for? Just for the fun of it. That said, you should try this game, it's a brainburner with funny meta-communication going around in your head: 'You did this because you mean...?'

An ingenious game-mechanic, but the crinkles need ironing out. The rules on how much you can communicate between players are deliberately left ambiguous, but this creates discord between players. What constitutes cheating here? And the goal of scoring your own personal high-score is fine if you play repeatedly with the same group, but pretty meaningless if you play occasionally with different people. All in all, an odd package, but undeniably a very clever concept.

It has this really great gimmick, but this is also its downfall. I've heard if you play it with the same group several times, it becomes mechanical and loses its charm.

This is like a good collaborative version of go fish where you work together with other players to put together a firework display through deducing what fireworks are in your hand by asking specifically defined and limited questions from other players and then playing the right suits in the right sequence in the central tableau. I purchased the deluxe version with ceramic tiles. This is a huge upgrade to the game. I love the tactile feel of the tiles and how much easier it is to handle them than the cards.

This is the perfect example of a cooperative game. Everyone must work together, and everyone has a chance to ruin the game. The games play so quickly, though, that no one gets mad when someone loses the game for the group. Had Dead of Winter trying to get to the table, but was using this as a filler between it and Netrunner. Kept saying "Just one more time!" so much that we played it a dozen times in a row. Fantastic game!

We really enjoy to play this game online with my gf and trying to achieve the perfect "25". The mechanic is quite brillant. Hanabi is one of the only game I know that I would define as "true coop" and as such should be at least tested once by anyone. 
The only downside I can think of it that once you have your strategy in place then it become much simpler

I'm new into boardgaming (I currently own just 6 games) and so far, this is the best of them. I love the concept and the game serves as an excellent way to cooperate with your friends. It's so fun and stressful at the same time, that it's just impossible not to love it. The best part is that you can carry it wherever you want since the box is extremely small.

My rating was going to be 10, but the game has a little issue. It's too difficult to follow the rules and don't give extra information while talking, and playing in complete silence would be just boring.

It is a nice card game where everyone sees your cards but you. It is something like a blind canasta. Where based upon the clues received from your buddies, you'll try to build a suite of numbers of the same color. It is an okay game, but it lacks the fun it supposed to provide.

I love this game, along with the Cookie Jar microgame. Self-hidden information is interesting! I'm a big fan of small box games. I enjoy guessing mitigated by probability.

Best feature: Co-op and you can cheat by talking.

Worst feature: Hard to reach an agreed convention while taking "no-talk/no-hints" rule seriously. I also hang out with friends so that I can converse with them.

Edit: I have almost no desire to play this game, since I am much more of a Competitive "Destroy your stuff" player. Still, a good couples task

A very fun game! It works well with two players, but I think a higher score can be earned if there are more players because you can see more cards. It is a little tricky to keep track of what you have in your hand. I used how I told the cards and the card's back designs (rotating them, etc.) as a strategy to help me remember what cards I have.

Давно хотел написать отзыв, но, видимо, так и не соберусь уже. 

После десятой партии (спустя полгода плотного увлечения настольными играми) жена сказала, что из всех коробок в наших шкафах "Ханаби" - самая правильная, представляющая из себя ровно то, что она ждала от настольных игр в принципе: общение и взаимодействие. Полное ощущение, что ты посредством карт играешь именно с другим человеком, а не пользуешься человеком как каким-то квази-AI, чтобы сыграть в игру (неважно, с кем). При игре на двоих ты будто бы завязываешь себе глаза, доверяешь свою судьбу напарнику, а он берёт тебя за руку и осторожно ведёт через минное поле. Ни с чем не сравнимые впечатления.

Ещё один интересный эффект не затронут в обзоре. Периодически в ходе игры возникает мощная иллюзия того, что ты всё идеально просчитал, и у твоего напарника есть только один-единственный верный ход (на который ты ему и намекаешь своей меткой подсказкой). На самом же деле, конечно, твой мозг отфильтровал часть информации, о другой части не догадывается, а у напарника, глядящего в твои карты, может быть вообще иное видение ситуации. В такие моменты очень легко могут возникнуть разочарования и конфликты, особенно если каждый из вас совершенно уверен в своих аналитических способностях. Видел, как на реддите игру называют divorce fireworks ;)

В общем, "Ханаби" - обоюдоострый скальпель, которым, при осторожном обращении можно добраться до самой души человеческих отношений. 


Ниже старые заметки.
поначалу сложно запоминать, что у тебя в руке (особенно, если напарник долго думает над ходом), карты в руке от напряжения гнутся, лучше иметь какую-то подставочку под них. 

Лида в итоге взяла блокнот с карандашом, записывать известные данные :)
я вроде справился и так, но пару раз забывал, что мне говорили. игра довольно весёлая, будем пробовать ещё. 

в комплекте сразу идёт дополение, которое добавляет радужный фейерверк, у которого все карты в одном экземпляре.

на BGG не указано, что есть русская версия (Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd). карты гнутся, края крошатся. очень хочется перейти на делюксовую версию. возможно, купим (и покрасим ;) набор домино.

долго дискутировали с Лидой, можно ли строить стратегию на порядке называния карт. в правилах этого нет, Лида считает такой подход нечестным.

BGG: твоя задача как умелого игрока в "Ханаби" - научиться действовать максимально предсказуемо во всевозможных ситуациях.

reddit: чувак на реддите идёт с девушкой на игротеку на первое свидание (она уже ходила туда сама), просит посоветовать подходящую игру.
некоторые упоминают "Ханаби". другие комментируют: By Hanabi, do you mean divorce fireworks? %)
https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3bqwlh/first_date_tonight_in_a_board_game_cafe/csp175d

в комплекте идёт мини-дополнение с шестым, радужным фейерверком (в локализации каждая карта только в одном экземпляре, что сужает число вариантов игры с этим дополнением). Лида шутит, что наш брак ещё недостаточно крепок для игры с ним ;)

RATING: 10
Incredibly elegant rule set in a coop game. To consistent score well you need a very complex analysis of what any communication (given or received) might mean and the risks and potential side effects of any suboptimal move you might accidentally encourage.

Juego cooperativo, sencillo y muy original.
Requiere bastante cooperación para conseguir lograr el objetivo de los 25 puntos, y hay que tener cuidado de no hacer "trampas".
Es un juego para partidas puntuales, económico y que no ocupa espacio. No apto para todos los públicos, aunque en general suele gustar.

About as tense as Space Alert, only slower!

I can't believe I'm giving a game which can be so easily broken an 8.75! I say "broken", of course, with regards to the vague communication rules. The only other problem is the poor colour choices: it might be unplayable by the colour-blind.

RATING: 1
This is a firework bridge. You have to have a group that has set up conventions, absolutely arbitrary conventions like the leftmost card is the newest and so on and if i don't clue you that's because in fact i need you to play your unclued #3 card and you must know that because i clued the 5th card of the 4th player last 7 turns (almost not kidding), then this group has to bost he has the most logical set of conventions ever devised in the history of logical science (it is not, it is only arbitrary and cheating IMHO) and called this hyper-finesse and then you drink tea in Melbourne and are very happy being in the Commonwealth of good logical bridge..erhmm.. sorry... Hanabi players. Better to throw the cards over and rearrange the suites by hand, more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cooperative game with a remarkable theme (that doesn't affect game play) and interesting twist.  You are trying to put on a great Japanese fireworks show, which means you must set off the explosives/play cards in a certain order, but you aren't able to see your own hand.  Other players can help you make a choice of which card to play, but they can only offer limited information.  It's easy to explain and fun to play, especially the first game where you really have no idea what to do with your cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hanabi—named for the Japanese word for "fireworks"—is a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order. (In Japanese, hanabi is written as 花火; these are the ideograms flower and fire, respectively.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've had some success introducing Hanabi to new gamers. I like that it's unique and draws people in because of the way it looks. But the group dynamic determines a lot about how fun the game will be. It's also a little tough to decide how to "fine tune" the several possible variants.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Pros
- Cool "holding cards outward" mechanic
- Have to listen to clues given and more importantly, the clues NOT given
- Deduction on what's left for the cards with what people have by elimination 
- Getting into the mind of your teammates to think what they'd think
- Taking a chance and playing a card is terrifying
- Applauding when someone discards the right card
- Yelling at someone they discard the wrong card
- Making fun of someone who keeps forgetting the clues given to him/her

Cons
- You kind of can't talk about the game while playing the game since anything you say off handed can be a clue of some sort

This is a very personal rating, It comes from the world of "drawing a card" for other people to see, but not yourself. In terms of creativity its great, but that also makes hurdles for those of us who have played every other card game with limited information.

I've been pleasantly surprised with this game. I thought it was strange that there is no clear way to win. It's a get as high of a score as you possibly can type of game. Gotten a perfect score only once with two players. I generally like a clear goal but this game works without it. I've played with a lot of non gamers and it's gone over well. Great game.

The concept of Hanabi is interesting but the first time I played we got 24 out of 25 points and I have no desire to ever play again. To be clear we were playing completely straight with the clues. No loosey goosey half hints, body English or asking what the other person knew. Just pure memory and logic.

A co-op filler card game-- very clever, depends very much on the group dynamic, well worth seeing. Unfortunately, I think it deteriorates on future plays as it's hard to avoid "conventions" about what one is communicating. And I never really like games where there are rules about what one cannot say.

Absolutely brilliant and nail-biting blind deduction/puzzle/co-op/make-you-sweat game.  How do the help tokens run out quickly?!  For a "get the highest score" game, it's so utterly gripping.  I've only played it at two players, and I can't begin to imagine the tension with more.  I think that implication is necessary to do well, but it has to be done without breaking the spirit of the rules. 

That said, it can fall flat easily if players either try too hard at additional communication or don't do very well as a meta group.

Hanabi is a very fun deduction card game that's easy to teach and creates plenty of those high-five moments only few cooperative games successfully do. That said, after a certain amount of sessions the general playstyle tends to become quite formulaic when playing with the same people over and over again. Hence for my first couple of sessions I'd rate this game an 8 or even higher, but the more I played the more I realized that this is the type of game that leaves a strong first impression and after that it never manages to impress as much anymore. Still a good game that gets occasionally played.

A great light-weight cooperative game.

The limits on communication and knowledge do a great job of addressing the problem of one player dominating a cooperative game and telling everyone else what to do.  You can talk some strategy between games, but otherwise all players need to make their own decisions each turn -- and each turn is important.

If there's a weakness, it's that the goal of the game isn't too exciting.  You're trying to get as many points as possible, so it lacks the tension of other cooperative game as to whether you'll pull off a victory or not.

Interesting logical deduction cooperative game in which players work together to solve a puzzle with partial information. Challenging and definitely a brain burner. Somewhat stressful because you don't want to make the wrong move when the others are counting on you.

The end game scoring is a little bland, since you never technically lose. Sometimes, it's just impossible to get a perfect score if both copies of a low card are at the bottom of the deck. Also, a little bit of accidental cheating can go on.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy this game but you have to be aware of who you are playing with.  If you are playing with someone who wants a definitive win or lose condition they could ruin the fun for you because this game is about putting on the best fireworks show and even if you sucked at playing it you still put on a fireworks display.  Here are the basics.  Total cooperative game.  You have cards numbered 1-5.  You will never know what you have in your hand though seeing as you don't look at it.  It is held out to show the other players.  You need to create the stacks of colors starting with 1 and going up to five but if you misplay three times the fireworks show goes off.  The more cards you get down before this happens the better the show.

Very solid. On one hand, tough to not "cheat." On the other, this offers a nice dynamism for house-ruling around mixed groups to suit play styles. I played the tile version, which was pleasantly tactile. Cards may be more usable, but annoying to hold.

RATING: 10
How difficult can it be to play, in ascending order, cards numbered from 1 to 5?  Pretty hard indeed when you don't get to look at your own cards, and clues to other players are limited to number or color, but not both!

A co-op card game with simple rules yet pretty deep gameplay, Hanabi requires a dedicated group to bring out all its nuances.  The more you play it, the better you become.  And since information isn't shared by all the players, it side-steps the "alpha gamer" syndrome of most co-op games.

Simply love the tight play, where you have to decide whether to give a clue, discard, or play.  And if you decide a clue must be given, then you have to decide to whom, and what clue will be most productive.

Tough with two players, better with three and more.

Simple, elegant, clever, and fast.  There simply isn't much more a game needs to be!  (A bit dry theme-wise.)

It's not a deep card game mechanically, but requires a lot of memory and logic and can definitely hurt your mind. Keep in mind it's a friendly co-op exercise...and try not to get frustrated at your partner(s). Nifty design, not sure if it deserved its SdJ award.

I didn't think that I would enjoy this game at all, but I was very pleasantly surprised by it. It is very inexpensive which is always a plus and actually has a lot of strategy and thought involved. This is a great game for a get together with friends. The one caveat is that tempers can flare a little in this game if people feel like you are forgetting or screwing up the clues, so don't play this with overly hostile or sensitive players.

Update: I still think this is a good game, but it really hasn't had much longevity with us. It seemed to get played out pretty quickly, so that drops its rating in my eyes.

One of very few co-operative games that I'm willing (and eager) to play, this could be due to the inability of one player to take over at all. The fact that paying particular attention can lead to gaining knowledge from clues to others, or what they play, is also likely a draw for me.

A really strong co-operative game that is about memory and deduction...I think it's particularly great because the rules leave a lot to be decided on in terms of how much "table talk" is allowed and of what type, meaning you can sort of fine tune the difficulty with house rules to your liking. Game too easy? Stop allowing a specific type of table talk or - if necessary - add in a rainbow suit variant. Granted that impreciseness is exactly why some may really dislike the game, but it totally works for me.

I played this today with my 14 year-old daughter.  I wanted to like this game more, but ended up giving it a 6.  My daughter gave it a 7, so we split the difference.  I enjoyed the tension of the game, but I didn't find it particularly challenging.  The first 2 games we played, we didn't light the fuse at all.  We then tried variant A, and I screwed up a couple of times leading to the fuse burning down halfway.  Still, my daughter and I were enough in-sync from the get-go that we picked up easily on each other's information clues, making the game somewhat rote.

I'm willing to try it again with more people, and also try some of the other variants.

Fun little co-op deduction game. Better than most co-ops, because you actually have to rely on other players to determine what is in your hand.

Great concept for a cooperative game. Reasonably swift and enjoyable, and much less puzzle-like than your average coop. I dislike the cards, though - having to hold them up constantly gets annoying as you'll frequently be clutching them too tightly - in dire need of a card holder, or the deluxe tiles edition.

RATING: 9
I firmly believe that this game is at its best, both in terms of challenge and enjoyment, when played with others who aim for the "purity of experience".  That is, where the transmission of information is limited to straight delivery of the clues.  People who play this game with a careless or, worse, intentional [i]nudge-nudge[/i], [i]wink-wink[/i] style reduce the experience to that of mediocre filler.

I rate it a 9 in the former case and a 5 in the latter.

Very impressive design. Small card game with an unusual amount of depth. You can play it with cards, tiles, or online (BGA). Personally, I find tiles to be superior over cards (easier to work with). Online still works but removes the memorization component; some gamers will like that but I personally feel memorization is a skill. Furthermore, without the memorization aspect... you start to feel the randomness more.

I've played the regular and deluxe edition; the regular edition is fine, even if it can be a bit tiring to hold those cards.

Great little puzzle game for 2-5 players. Players play against the game but with it's small size and portability I could see playing multiple games in a setting or storing it in a bag for unplanned gaming opportunities.

Very light and easy to teach with novelty of players not being able to look at their own hands and relying on clues and clear communication from the team to decide their best moves. I could see players getting more strategic with clues upon multiple games and quickly learning from mistakes made with clues/timing in earlier games.

light, fast, portable, social, challenging and family friendly.

A very simple cooperative game of unbelievable genius: everybody can see all the cards held by every player except himself, and must give clues to the others so they can deduct when they can play or discard a card.
The goal is making 5 straight "fireworks", one for each suit, before the game ends (because players made three mistakes, or deck runs out).
This sounds very simple, and it is as far as rules are concerned, but this game has so many levels of deduction and communication that is amazingly difficult to play well.
A true little gem, and the best Bauza I've played so far!

Such a great game deserved a gorgeous edition with a collector's feel, and thankfully after winning the SdJ it got it!

An interesting game where you are not allowed to see your cards. Information about what you have is revealed by the other players who can only do one of the 3 actions,

a. Tell a clue, either color or numbers about the cards.

c. Discard a card.

So far with 2 plays we managed to score 20, 23. Good game to play.

The "hold your cards backwards" mechanism is very special and needs to get used to it. Half the game it feels wrong how you hold them :)

During the game you receive hints from other players and are free to rearrange your cards (4 or 5) as you like. You now need to remember the received clues about your cards - like card numbers (1-5) and card colours (red, green, blue, white or yellow).
Furthermore you need to pay attention which player received which clues about their cards because you don't want to repeat what is already known (or should be at least) because the amount of clues is very limited.

It's amazing how such a small game tests your ability to memorise that limited amount of information. It certainly is more brain-y than I expected it to be.

(updated comment) The cardplay in this game is really compelling, and provides a great shared puzzle to solve with any particular group of people. I do find the 'firework' scoring mechanism to be abstract and the notion of chasing a high score to be unrewarding. These thoughts have only really crystallised in my mind after playing "Beyond Baker Street", which uses a similar card mechanism, but layers on theme, a good setting and a scalable challenge where you can definitely win or lose the game!

(3-5 Players, 30 min) A card game about a crew of fireworks pyrotechnicians with a terrible hangover. The show's about to start and none of the rockets are in place. This would be an easy task but no one can see what's right in front of them and it's hard to hear! You'll need to pay attention to the clues your team gives you about the fireworks in your hand because you can't look at them yourself. Make too many mistakes and the show is over.

First Play: From the outset I must say I am yet to play a coop game that I like but this game had a buzz so I thought I should try it out.

From the off, the game needs a card rack for each person to enable you to use your hands for other things. We improvised bent frames from a previously punched game. Next after some clues had been given an obvious code evolved that if someone stated that a player had a certain colour, that they 'should' lay it. After that the logic was tissue thin. If a player was in the dark about their hand then they had irrelevant or high-ish cards. Throughout I was struggling to find a game but became increasingly of the opinion I was playing 4 person patience.

At game end the deck ran out and we achieved a score but there was no sense of playing well or badly, just a sense of futility. Again I am amazed that people rave about this when I can see no game at all.

Enjoyable cooperative deduction card game. Simple and fun. With that said, I refuse to play this with people that insist on using a structured clue-giving system. I don't really care how high a score we can get. It's impossible to get a perfect score in this game without effectively cheating. I much prefer the challenge of deducing your hand and trying to find clues that give deeper information.

I don't get why Hanabi is popular. I see a very simple little card game where the group itself makes how hard or easy they want it to be. I think I enjoy a little more structure in my games. There was too much, "this is a 5, and THIS IS A 5!!!!! (hint, hint, wink, wink)". Trade pile.

RATING: 7.5
This game is astonishingly clever. Elegantly designed, with just cards and only three choices to make on your turn. However, the gameplay is incredibly tense as you try to both give good clues and remember what cards you have in your hand.  Gets a little thinky, but like all co-ops provides a wonderful challenge- and at a reasonable price. Pick this one up!

I know the good folks that award the Spiel des Jahres (game of the year award) love new mechanics in games, and I applaud them for rewarding innovation, but I just don't understand why this is so loved. It plays terribly with two players, and while it is unique and approachable, I find no one ever wants to play it a second time. Including me.

RATING: 7
Interesting, cooperative card game where players can see everyone's hand other than their own.  On your turn you can play a card, give a clue (if there are any clue tokens available), or discard a card (and receive a clue token).  The goal is to play cards in increasing order 1-5 in each of 5 colors.  Your score is based on your successfully played cards.

RATING: 9
This game shouldn't work. I have no idea why it does. I mean all we're doing is trying to play 25 cards down on the table in order. You're restricted on your clues, so you can never say everything you want. Add into that the fact that there is no real win condition, just a beat-your-best-score system, and I thought I might hate it! How unbelievably wrong I was! It's cooperative and puzzley, so I was naturally inclined to like it on those 2 counts. I love trying to communicate with such limited clues, and it's equally fun on the receiving end of those clues. "If I tell him that's a 3, will he realize it's the blue 3 we need?", or on the other side, "He just told me those are both 3s, should I assume they are both the blues we need?" Now even with all this good deep think, it could still get knocked down a peg because it has that annoyance of no real win condition. Yet somehow it makes you hold onto that hope that next time might be the time you'll hit that perfect score. I am simply amazed that I am so deeply enthralled with this game, and find myself with the desire to keep trying again and again.

Whoa... this game will twist your brain in a different way.  I love games with new ideas and mechanics and this game has that for sure.  Trying to clue your teammates into understanding what's in their hand while not screwing up your own hand makes for a good, fun cooperative game.  I think replayability with the same group of people would be a problem with this game.  Also, finding the right group of intelligent people who don't give things away is key.

I want to like this game more than I do.  Two-player games are great for taxing your memory but they can also be very frustrating (unless you just don't care how your display turns out).  Four-player games offer less information, resulting in more discarding or taking of chances.  

Either way (large group or small), the game can be enjoyable.  But of all the casual card games we own (Bohnanza, Timeline, For Sale, Star Fluxx, Boss Monster), this makes it out the least.

Update: Included in a trade.  Just didn't get played much and my wife wasn't a fan of it.

I can’t even see where Hanabi’s titular fireworks are, as it’s just a matter of how communication is handled by the players, whose task is to act like retarded and pretend they’re not giving out too much to their partners: there’s nothing even remotely fun here, which makes me wonder whether it can still be rated a boardgame.

A clever, somewhat memory-intensive game with lots of hidden info that quickly pushes you into meaningful decisions. But, can sometimes feel more like work than fun, and I've found that people too often stretch the rules to their liking re: what communication is allowed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The design is fine, but I now actively despise the "game between the game", or metagame, when you try to guess what people intend with their clues. Each group forms their own "language", for lack of a better term, in which a clue in a certain context takes on a meaning that to that group becomes obvious. But for someone joining that group, with less experience, a lot of frustration develops. "Obvious" clues are misinterpreted, to the incredulity of the existing members.

Team games and partnership games with hidden information and limits on communication cause this frustration. An experienced player often cannot understand why a certain move was made, putting the teammate on the defensive. "Why did you make THAT move?!" I don't know, okay, it was the best move I could think of based on the limited information available TO ME, which don't forget is different than the information you have. Questioning why I did a move when the alternative is "obvious", you may not realise, is in fact a criticism, no matter how nicely it's said -- and I don't need that in a game I thought I was playing for fun.

Don't suggest it's the fault of the people I'm playing with. My friends are awesome in almost every game we play. But not every game encourages these experiences.

I will not play this game again, if I have any say in the matter.

2013: Gift of Guy M. Great little co-op game, original and I think unique. Refreshing to see a game so fast, full of meaningful decisions and yet co-operative in a really different way. Can't wait to make my wed night game group play it to see how it plays with four.

EDIT Oct '17: Played it at a work board game night and  my colleagues' instant enjoyment really drove the game up again in my estimation. It's so easy to teach, but it's challenging and its intervention into mechanical design is really revolutionary.

RATING: 7.5
A co-op filler?  It goes pretty quick and we found it to be a challenge.  We got into a groove on how to work the clues (played with four, twice) and we did all right with 20 in the first game and 19 in the second.  It's hard to manage the clues and the deck.  One slip can cost you points and time.  It doesn't overstay it's welcome at all, either.  Looking forward to trying again.

I'm not a huge fan of cooperative games, but Hanabi approaches the genre from a more enjoyable perspective. It feels more like a team sport in that everyone is working together for a common goal, but you are responsible for your own decisions. What I don't like about coops is the sense that other people make your decisions for you, and that's much less fun.

// Haven't played this one in a while as of writing this 
(October '16). It almost feels more like a team-building
exercise than a typical game. I'd like to try the version
that uses tiles instead of cards to find out if that
changes the game play in any significant way - I kind of 
think it would just be easier overall than holding a hand
of cards that I'm not allowed to look at.

I don't really like it that much.  I never feel like I get to do much on my turn as I'm limited to playing a card or giving a clue.  When I play card, I pretty much feel like I'm just guessing which one is the best.  Maybe we just haven't figured out how to best give clues.

RATING: 5.5
An interesting and somewhat stressful cooperative deduction game. In general, I'm not find of the "you can say anything but the exact name of the card" mechanic; however, it works okay here. There is a certain amount of educated guessing in this game, which can be stressful if playing with people who are taking the game too seriously. Hanabi is certainly not in my top tier of deduction games, but it's not bad.

Unique coop card game which turns your hand around so you can't see your cards but everyone else can. You need to work as a team to give the right clues to each other to progress. Quite puzzly in some respects, but the sweetness here is in the interaction, the moments of teeth-grinding frustration when your 'obvious' clue is picked up the wring way and heart in the mouth moments as another player decides which card to discard. Great fun, really happy with this game.

3 plays:

I love this game for its elegant balance of simplicity and depth. Although the rules seem a bit fiddly at first (and, typically, the instructions are very confusingly written), groups I've introduced it to enjoy it once it's up and running. Then, it's a great game for a smart group who wants to enjoy themselves. 

Intense, but not frustrating because of its cooperative nature. Tends towards some slow analysis paralysis--a group of players who don't play a lot of games made take a long time--but again that's mitigated by cooperation; you don't feel that you must take as long as the previous player to keep up. 

Definitely requires a good level of skill and abstract thinking. Expands and contracts easily from 2-8 players. 

The last group of adults I introduced to the game felt so-so about it.

Es un juego de deducción, similar al cinquillo, pero tiene la novedad de que cada jugador ve las cartas de los demás, pero no las propias y tiene que pasarles información dandoles pistas. El jugador puede escoger entre dar una pista, jugar una carta o descartar. El descarte permite además recuperar pistas que son limitadas para todos los jugadores (creo que 8). Hay que formar 5 palos numerados del 1 al 5.

I really get a kick out of this game, which is very light and very easy for new players to pick up. It perhaps lacks the excitement and replayability of a truly great game (every game of Hanabi tends to feel about the same). Every once in a while, though, this is a fun way to spend twenty minutes. It is quite challenging--in about 10 Hanabi games (usually with 3 players), I have never come that close to a perfect game. As always, I really enjoy the cooperative aspect. (I'm someone who loves the strategy and sociability of board games, but who is a deeply uncompetitive person!)

A seemingly simple-to-play coop game that requires players to become more thoughtful in the way they communicate, with a deduction element similar to the Espionage 2-player game.

This is the purest co-op I've yet encountered; there's no real possibility of an alpha player.

This game has a clever design and plays refreshingly different but I just don't find it any fun. I feel like a handicapped child having to stick some colored symbols out in front of myself where everyone else can see except me - equivalent to walking around oblivious to a "kick me" sign stuck on your back. The game also lacks any excitement as you just competing for a group victory point range. After a while I found it more fun and interesting to give stupid clues and not help people who had not helped me and try and crash the game, but we still ended up winning with a good score.

If we played this game more, I'd probably rate it higher. It's not due to the actual game, which I find to be excellent.

Just haven't played it as much as we should.

RATING: 6
A simple and innovative concept for a cooperative game. 

I love games where you have to communicate through game elements (like the hints in this game) but that always creates the problem where you are basically supposed to have no table talk at all. It's very difficult if everybody is chatting, not to give any extra clues to the other players. Even when you're quiet, you can give clues with (maybe unintentional) mimics. Cheating a little bit like this doesn't really hurt the game though, maybe it's even the most fun part catching the little hints or seeing how another player doesn't catch one. It makes the game easier, but it's still challenging to score well.

I'm not sure if it has a high replay value though.

Terrific cooperative game where you can see everyone's cards but your own. The group tries to build piles of cards from 1 to 5 in each of five colors. Since you can't see your own cards you must give clues to your partners in the form of telling how many are of a particular color or number. Players must pick up on subtle clues (perhaps you didn't receive a clue because none of your cards are playable) and synthesize the information that moves around the table in order to complete the challenge before them.

Highly recommended.

Cool little Co-Op filler.

Hanabi is a really cool game with just a small deck of cards and a few tokens. You try to reach a certain amount of points...meh...but it's really difficult. And that's what elevates the game: relatively high difficulty for such a simple game and a very short playtime.
You just reached less then half of the points? Well let's try again.

Cool game, high quality cards and high portability for just under 5€? Perfect.

After 49 plays we finally scored a perfect game.

This game is kind of cute, and very original, but I don't think I love it. There is a skill at knowing when to give a hint and when to discard, and the cooperative element is hilarious as people try to communicate without giving anything away. I think the game eventually gets a little old after doing the same thing again and again on every turn, but it's fun for what it is. Good for non-gamers.

My favorite cooperative game.

I don't usually like coops - when I play games, I want to do as well as possible.  In a coop, that often involves too much discussion and pre-planning that makes turns long and unfun.  Hanabi solves this problem entirely by restricting the ways in which you are allowed to communicate.  Other games, like Space Alert, have solved this problem with time constraints - while I love Space Alert, Hanabi is just more elegant.

There are also fun information-theoretic considerations, here.

Cooperative cardgame with a twist: You see all the cards people have in their hands, except your own cards.

De los juegos cooperativos más sencillos que hay. Trata de que entre todos se tienen que ayudar a bajar cartas en determinado orden, dándose pistas entre sí de qué tiene cada quien en su mano, puesto que a uno no se le permite ver las cartas de su mano.
Es entretenido ver si en cada partida un grupo de juego puede mejorar su puntuación y en pensar diferentes estrategias para optimizar las pistas.

This controlled information sharing, and the lack of knowledge in regards to your own cards, results in possibly the most cooperative game I've ever played. Not only can you not tell others what to do, but you have to rely on the information others give you in order to play your cards.

This game involves a lot of learning about your play partners. Some people tell you you have a red card so that you'll play it, some people tell you so that you'll dump it. Some people throw away the first card to the left, some the first card to the right. We don't talk about our reasons for communication and we discover them during play, although I suppose the game could be made easier by discussing strategies before play starts.

You have to trust your play partners. They told you about a particular card and not about another? You have to trust that they gave you the most important information first.

You also have to learn how to use the red tokens. There are three and you get the same score with zero, one, or two of them used, so having zero of them used, might indicate something you threw away that you should have tried to play.

You have to learn how to use the blue tokens. There are only so many of them and getting down to one often puts you in a nasty pattern of discarding good cards because you can't keep each other informed. You have to maximize the information you give the other players so that by combining the informations they get, they can learn about their hand with as few tokens used as possible.

You have to keep track of the discards to know what's safe to lose, and to figure out what you have in your hand.

You have to learn to prioritize what you need to tell your partners. Ideally they'll know their entire hand, but since that's impossible, what do they need to know first, and what can you afford to never tell them about?

The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. My best game to date? 24. And even if we ever get the game of 25, the perfect game, there's still the advanced game after that. This game has plenty of replayability.

Having played the game online, I can testify to two things, one, playing the game without having the remember anything and without having to worry about what others remember, is a lot more fun because you can then make very clever clue gives. Two, it is so much more fun to play the game with people you know.

This makes the act of trying to communicate with your friends and turns it into a game. If that doesn't sound fun to you, you probably won't enjoy this. But I enjoy it quite a bit.

This is one of the first co-op games I've played that doesn't feel like it might as well just be a solo game. I wouldn't quite call this a brain burner - but certainly it could go that direction if you let yourself think about all the possible implications of everything you/your teammates do - I just think of it as having a pleasant puzzley feel. The rules and goals are simple, but there's a LOT to think about.

It's funny how you can psych yourself out just by trying to figure out how to give out information, or double-guess everything people do trying to gleam some extra meaning from their plays.

Luck is obviously a factor, so I appreciate that it's beat-your-highscore rather than pass/fail. The difference between playing well and playing poorly is a matter of skill, but the difference between playing a good game and a perfect one is a matter of luck.

I could see how some people might see the system as easily broken by coming up with conventions and agreeing to them as a group, but that goes against the spirit of the game.

Since it is a puzzley kind of game this might not have the staying power of other fillers, but definitely one of the more unique and interesting games you can play while it lasts.

Update: YES! FINALLY! Perfect score! (Without rainbows)

This game has a great mechanic that involves not seeing your hand. You have to hold your hand backwards and get information from your friends at the table, in order to build a fireworks show. Sounds stupid, but it's a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
Only a few plays, but rating could definitely go up. This is my kind of game, and it just feels like a classic. Extremely simple rules, but lots of sophistication available in clue giving, and its all about exploiting the human element - computers would probably suck at this game. People who say there is no real deduction - you have green cards, this is a 3, oh green 3, repeat - don't get this at all. It's like people who think poker is boring because its all about bluffing. I worry about this getting to the table with the different types of people I game with, as this doesn't really fit any of my current groups, but I'll try and we'll see.

RATING: 8
Hanabi is such a brilliantly designed game that you wonder why it wasn't invented before 2010! It's a coop, but unlike many coops where you can play them solo, this one needs 2-5 players. The reason is that you're giving clues to each other about which cards you have in your hand - and the catch is that you're holding your cards outwards, so you cannot see them yourself, but everybody else can! This is truly a unique game, and the fact that I've played it more than a 100 times says a lot as that's rare for me!

The rules are simple and the gameplay is easy to understand as well, but not easy to play well... You need to be inside each other's heads when giving clues if you want to win (well, that is score the maximum of 25 points at least; "winning" is very easy, but getting 25 points is not)! It's so hard to give great clues, and you can only hope to win if you do give some clues that tell more than just the thing you're actually saying... It takes many plays to refine how you give and receive clues, and of course that also requires the same group of people. This can lead to some group think (which way to discard from etc.), but I haven't found it too much of a problem. If anything, it's actually even more "annoying" when playing with new players who don't understand your obviously great clues... ;) 

There is almost nothing more satisfying than finally getting those damn 25 points! I've only done it 10 times, but a couple of times it's been very close as well, and you can see that you get better each time. 

The theme isn't that interesting, but I don't care as I see it purely as an abstract game, at which it excels! Oh, I do have to mention that, like almost everybody else, we play it that you can ask "what do you remember" before giving a clue; not that you are allowed to confirm what they're saying, so if they're way off you have to give a clue, but in order for the game not to rely too much on memory and, more importantly, on what you think the other persons are still remembering... I think it's way more fun played this way, but ymmv.

In any case, it's a great game that I can never see myself getting rid of!

Still enjoying this after 10 plays. I have not made the game anymore difficult then it is. Game works as a good filler in many groups and is a great social game. It is kind of anti-climatic towards the end when players just add the points to beat a score, but its a Great $10 game!

An interesting game where you can't look at your own cards and everyone else gives you hints about what you have in order to successfully build 'fireworks' as a team.

It's a different and unique game and not difficult to learn.  It's also a quick play and great for group interaction.

I even have friends who enjoy just watching other people play because they say it's amusing to see everything and see how people communicate things.

Hanabi is probably one of the better deduction games I've played. It's simple, it's fun... there's plenty of nuance to try and communicate with your other players.

The only potential knock I might anticipate about the game is that a group that plays this together a handful of times will develop a set of conventions that creates a barrier against others entering. Still, I played it twice, and I'd gladly play it again.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]Brilliant twist on a co-operative game as you don't know what cards you have but you can see everyone else's.  Suffers from limited options and luck as to when the starter cards come out and I've yet to have a perfect game.  My favourite games have been with 2 or 3 rather than 5.

RATING: 9.3
Main Positives: A great coop game engaging people not just to casually play but to also think deeply.

Fun Factor: High
Complexity: Medium (better to play without the wild cards at the beginning and add them later)
Replayability: Yup! But a game that I could play forever.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
Nothing much. It's a game I'd like to play when I'm really in the mood to keep my cards raised so that other players can see your cards or so that you won't be able to see your own hand.

It kind of suffers when a skilled player and new players are in the same game. I swear, it takes a major force of will not to say "why the hell did you do that?" throughout the entire thing. But, man, this is just a excellent game. One I wish I would play more often with the same folks. But, maybe that's more evidence of just establishing meta for optimal play, which might ruin it for some.

A brain burner that I don't personally jive with 100%, but it's undeniably genius and fun for almost anyone to play a few times at least. Very affordable. The card quality isn't the best, and the packaging is useless in how tight is squeezes the cards together. I sleeved these and things work much better. A couple of cards have marks on them out of the box (on the back of them, which is the worst spot for marks in this game).

Good little game. The tin it comes in sucks. The tin is a terrible terrible tin. The bits fall out everywhere and all sorts. The actual game is an interesting one in that it is a very thoughtful game (as in, you need to think a lot) but with the odd bashful comment or slip of tounge, the whole thing can come crashing down. Once you get the players to agree that there is a certain way TOO play this game, and a certain way to NOT play this game, that's where the game loses some of its charm. Try not to formalise it too much and it will repay you with a fun 45 minutes in thanks.

[thing=98778][/thing] is a [b]cooperative card game [/b]. Players work together to place five suites/colors of cards in ascending numerical order from 1-5 (without repeating or skipping any numbers). Cards are held so that they are only visible to the other players; players do know their own cards! In this way, typical card game mechanics such as [b]hand management[/b] and [b]set collection[/b] become a cooperative affair, which introduces a unique and highly engaging level of [b]deduction, memory[/b], and [b]press your luck[/b] elements into the game. 

On his/her turn a player may give a numerical OR a color clue to another player, play a card, or discard a card. Constant evaluation and adjustment to communication styles, cooperative team work, a sharp memory, and a little luck are required to win.

******************************************
When looking for a great game to introduce people to the board game hobby I have a few guidelines that I usually stick to:

1. Game must have short instruction time. You need to be playing quick, before they lose interest.

2. The game should play in a short time period as well. I always want to give them the opportunity to ask to play again, or an exit point if it simply was not for them.

3. Social interaction. The game must be interactive and engage people socially. If there are any 'take that' mechanics/interactions in the game, they should be light hearted.

4. Something readily available. Everyone (who enjoyed it) always wants to know where they can find this new game because you hear things like, "we should take this to your parent's cabin next weekend", or "that would be great for Christmas," or whatever...

5. I solved #4 by usually just leaving the game with them to keep. So, the game has to be relatively cheap. My goal is to introduce the non-gamers to the game, but let them become gamers in their own time. Hard to do that if they don't have a (good) game available to do so!

6. # of people. Usually you are pretty safe with a 4 player game. 

[b]Hanabi![/b] is an awesome game for all of the above reasons!

Innovative co-op.  Different than everything else I own.  Nice deduction mechanisms too.  It is almost a social experiment to see how groups of players teach each other and learn from each other how to get as much information as possible out of one clue.  It can lose its luster when players cheat (you have a one here and HERE), but even those observations are fascinating to watch unfold.

I just don't play this that often because you have to find juuust the right group to make it work. As it turns out, that perfect group for me was a group of Aspie teenagers. We had a lot of fun being overly literal with the rules and finding all sorts of ways to edge the line and arguably break the rules...well sometimes blatantly and horribly. What's not fun--when people are way too focused on following the rules to the T. What's also not fun--when people cheat and push those boundaries non-stop. Basically, you have to know that this game comes with blurry rules that are hard to enforce consistently. The game is decidedly cooperative but in a different and (can be!) fun way. The ability to roll with the unique flow of the game is central to having an enjoyable experience. For me, I have had a couple of really fun games and a few more meh type of games.

After scoring a 4 player 25 then a 2 player 30 with rainbow tiles, I have no real desire to play again. Once you use a system to be effective with hints the game hardly requires decisions...merely application of the system. The rest is luck of tile draw order. I can't imagine playing with cards after using the deluxe tiles but I will definitely not get my money's worth out of getting a tile set.
Hmm  already feels like been there done that but it was addictive while I was chasing a top score.
This game is addictive but unsatisfying - especially when it takes way too long to play and once you start you don't play anything else.
I will not likely play again.

No idea what all the fuss is about. So you get SdJ for misholding your cards nowadays? Odd. Though I can see the appeal to non-gamers, which is actually a good thing and has to justify the SdJ, if there's nothing else to do that.

Hanabi really did surprise me: The game looks rather dull and after reading the rules I almost had it written off as yet another slightly boring cooperative game. I was wrong. Well, the game still looks dull and of course the theme is as arbitrary as it can ever get. But I have A LOT of fun playing this game! It feels like some sort of multiplayer "Master Mind" and I've always been a fan of this kind of deduction games. I do however need a notepad to make a scrib sheet about my own cards as the game progresses - because I hate "Memory" as much as I like "Master Mind". Also you should be warned that playing this game will inevitably lead to a discussion about what is considered cheating the game. But as the rules put it: As long as you're having fun playing the game, you're doing it right. Update: And now I officially like a "Spiel des Jahres", who'd have thought of that ever happening again? (This is for the ABACUSSPIELE (2012) edition.)

An unusual game that can vary greatly depending on the group, but with the right group it's really fun...and very challenging! Also love that you can take it anywhere. Despite the scoring, it doesn't have that 'just one more' hook for my group unfortunately.

I thought that this would be a much better co-op game since the player is so reliant upon the hints of the other players to succeed.  The game mechanics seemed very interesting too (a complex version of indian poker!).  But overall, I found that it was just too hard for players not to cheat as a team.  Also, the two-player game is frustrating and kind of tedious.

Hanabi is likely going to be the only SdJ-winning game I own after the SdJ went 'soft' (which happened after the Torres disaster). It is beautiful as well as intruiging how such a simple change—card reversal—coupled to strict hint procedures can create such good tension between the players.

That said, I'm going to be a little conservative with the rating as I susect that once the players have worked out a good hint strategy (which would only involve making use of the time a card entered one's hand—it makes sense to keep track of this although no verbal clues whatsoever are exchanged) it becomes all a rather formulaic procedure to see if the formulae can solve the particular state of the card deck. It still isn't easy to get a perfect score then, and your memory mustn't fail... but still proceeding according to a fixed formula. If such a convention is not adopted, or the players do not make use of time information, then the game is more lax, and more fun to play with non-gamers. It is for those circumstances, to see people learn what is needed, that I award the game the rate I gave it. Once it is 'solved', you can deduct 1 point from the rate.

Hanabi is the Rubik`s cube of the gaming world. Delightfully different and most people will at first glance think it`s an easy game to solve. Unfortunatly this game suffers from the human condition known as the inflated ego. Any person with a normal sense of self esteem will say "How hard can it be to reach a legendary score?" and then proceed to cheat through their teeth to prove that it`s not unsolvable. With kids/teenagers this type of behavior is frowned upon and accepted. In grown ups it becomes down right embarrassing. My definition of a good co-op includes the communication that ensues while players discuss different options available to them as a team. Hanabi is tooooo restricted in this respect. It was a pleasant diversion , but not something
with a lasting appeal , unless players can somehow play by the real rules: "No subliminal messages or exaggerated
facial expressions permitted". Experienced "Bridge" players will understand the dilemma this game faces.

RATING: 8
Despite some missteps in our first play, I could see the interesting game underneath.  In the age of cooperative games, this is unique with its deductive element.

Very simply, the group is trying to play as many cards in each of 5 colors in order.  But you can't look at your own cards, and other players have to sacrifice a play to give out a clue - and you only get so many of those.  Clues can only be of two types - which of your cards are a color, or which are a number.

Incredibly tough, but hard to not want another go when you've finished a play.  I'll give it a try again soon, I'm sure.

REVISED: The more we play, the more I enjoy it.  This is a game that's as serious as the group wants to make it, which is a good scalable factor in party games.

Antoine Bauza at it again. This guy always impresses me on how different his games are. Hanabi is a fantastic value for the $10ish dollar mark. I was surprised at how much tension can develop from such a simple to explain game. Note I said simple to explain, the execution is much harder. We have yet to build all 5 displays but seem to get better with each play. Always fun to play with someone new because they don't have the past experience or know why/how you give the clues. I have yet to play it with a larger group but I bet it would be fun. We play it at lunch at work because it is fairly quick, instant setup and full of game for such a small package.

What Are My Cards Again?/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A co-operative game that, through hidden information and heavy limitations on the passing of information, actually requires the unique perspectives of multiple players. This, in my limited experience, is rare: all other co-op games I've played have effectively been solitaire games played by multiple people at once.

The game itself is fairly simple, and the outcome will be heavily influenced by the players' level of restrictions on communication, vocal reasoning, reminders of previous clues, and discarding conventions: 'no passing information outside clue actions' can be very broadly interpreted. 

The random order of the deck can doom some games: there are some combinations that are impossible to do well with (all the 1s at the bottom would be an extreme but technically possible example). The caprices of the deck, and the difficulty of policing communication, make it difficult to judge the extent to which an improvement in performance is down to skill.

Hanabi is nonetheless a very fun, short and light game that offers some challenge, no matter what level of strictness a group settles on (as long as they're consistent).

This is a great filler game that can take over a game night.  Rewards multiple plays with the same group.  Highly frustrating game when your partners misinterpret clues you give them or forget about previous clues you gave them.  Always devastating to get cut off from completing a certain number.  There's also a serious amount of deduction in this game which means paying attention to everyone's hand and what is in the discard pile is a must for giving good clues or figuring out what color that 5 is in your hand!  Highly recommend this game to everyone.

Las primeras partidas un caos, pero cuando le cojes el truco, sorprende. Muy original, pero es problemático cuando juntas gente que sabe jugar y novatos. Puede llegar a ser algo frustrante.
EDIT: Pero si consigues jugar solo con gente que domine la lógica, y se juega al modo "Perfect", la experiencia de juego es espectacular. No conozco ningún otro juego que ofrezca estas sensaciones... aunque la facilidad con la que puedes cagarla e inflingir las reglas es enorme, su único fallo a mi ver.

Components: Functional, attractive, sturdy. The box is too tight.

Experience: Hasn't been well received. There is too fine a line between offering information that I hope will be interpreted in a certain way, and developing code (even without trying) and thus cheating. It's also frustrating to misread my partner's cues and have my own cues misread; this isn't really cooperation; it's more a deduction game where each partner provides randomness for the other.

it's like therapy. a cooperative game where no player has all the information. to get better scores, you have to trust each other more! which means that you will have to relinquish control to the other players, and trust that they will make good decisions. because they know the one thing that you don't (which is also the one thing that you want to know more than anything): they know what cards you hold.

this game builds so many good things on the inside. make sure you play this gem!

HANABI

SUMMARY:
It's Team Co-op Solitaire where you are the only one who doesn't know what your cards are.

PROS:
• Hanabi is super-easy to learn. There are not that many rules to get confused by.
• The "Indian Poker" mechanic, whereby everyone knows your cards except for you, is fantastically executed. Just going through the rules with new players is enough to get people interested in playing the game, because the mechanic is generally unheard of outside of the "Who Am I?" game.
• The game can be changed to accommodate many different levels of difficulty. It can be made more easy by adding additional Note Tokens, or by adding the Rainbow cards as "Wild" cards. On the other end of the spectrum, it can be made increasingly more difficult by removing Note Tokens, by adding the Rainbow cards as a sixth suit, or by adding the Rainbow cards as a sixth suit with the rule that they need to be described as belonging to any other color (meaning it is very difficult to tell if the "Red" card you are about to play is not actually a Rainbow). The difficulty can be enforcing the level of table-talk that can go on — for example, banning (or permitting) the emphasis people place on their hints ("You have a two HEEEERE... and here") or on the faces people are allowed to make as someone begins to play a card.
• The atmosphere around the table is incredibly tense. There are literally not enough Hint Tokens to get a complete picture of what you have in your hand. Almost every play you make will be based on trust, and the ability of the group to give time-appropriate hints ("Why would you tell me I have a two if you didn't want me to play it now??"). It's hard to describe how exciting such a simple little card game can be.
• There is a lot of strategy to be had, thanks to the fact that your group will burn through Hint Tokens very quickly. You will want to prioritize telling your teammates what cards to play soon (that red-4 we are waiting to play now), the cards they must never discard (all the 5's), and which cards are safe to discard in exchange for more Hint Tokens (in the late game, these will be low-level cards). This is not a simple game with only one "correct" move.
• Unlike other cooperative games, Hanabi prevents "quarterbacking" from occurring, whereby one player dictates to all the others what the "best" move to make is. Since everyone only has partial information, true cooperation is a must.

CONS:
• I found the artwork to be a little lackluster in all of the Hanabi versions released (with the exception of Hanabi Deluxe, which has minimalistic designs on their brick-like dominoes). The art itself is not bad... but it is very repetitive, as the same temple drawing is present at the base of every single card, front and back — I get what they were going for, but I feel like the individual card designs could be far more beautiful and do not live up to their full potential.
• The designers decided to make the sets of fireworks always at around the same size on the card (so Red-2 has two very large fireworks, while Red-5 has 5 smaller-sized fireworks), and this can make it harder to use the artwork to tell how much the card is worth. People tend to use only the numbers in the corner.
• Probably the worst design decision (in the Abacusspiele version, at least) are the colors used for Green/Blue. In dim lighting, they are nearly identical. This is remedied by the fact that each suit is represented by a unique character under the numbers, in addition to its unique color. However, the green really needs to be just a few shades brighter.
• Hanabi is an abstract game... basically any theme could be applied to it, and it could even be played with regular playing cards. This, in and of itself, is not a bad thing — however, it appears that the designers WANTED to give the game a theme (of sorts) by having us impress a crowd of onlookers at a Japanese palace... so I do not feel like it is unwarranted for me to say that the theme they applied isn't done in a very cohesive manner that makes the mechanics easier to grasp for new players. So... we are building a fireworks show, but for some reason only our friends know the colors of the fireworks we are holding? What exactly are we doing, from a thematic perspective? It is not explained in the rulebook.
• The box (for the Abacusspiele version, at least) is at least twice the size it needs to be. Half of the box fits all of the cards, while the 12 tokens go in the rest of the box. So jostling the box mixes up all the tokens with the cards. I suggest you make some sort of insert or token-box to separate things. That said, the box is very small (the size of an Uno box), so it's not a big deal. However, the fact is that the game could very easily be adapted to a 72-card deck (with the tokens replaced by 12 cards) and this would make it significantly easier to transport.

CONCLUSION:
• Hanabi is surprisingly tense, and there is a lot of challenge even in the Basic game, without the addition of the Rainbow Cards.
• The many different game modesthat come in the box provides tons of replayability, and the fact that the variants are already included in the box (and are not some kind of "expansion" that needs to be bought separately) is greatly appreciated. Because the cards are simplistically designed, players can invent their own variants, or mix-and-match, to create even more difficult challenges.
• Some design decisions are a bit lacking, but it is certainly not an "ugly" game by any stretch of the imagination.
• This is an incredibly fun game for how small it is, and for its incredibly cheap price (less than $10) there is no reason not to have this on-hand for your next get-together.

Cooperative game of knowing how to give hints and how to interpret them. Tension from having a limited number of hints, and restrictions on how to give them. Players cannot see their own cards, only the cards of other players. On his turn, he can either play a card (and hope it is playable), discard a card (and reset one hint token), or give one hint to another player. 

Clever game, but requires too much skill in memory, of which I lack.

"Fireworks" A coop card game where everyone is trying to build one the perfect fireworks display by placing cards on the table in the right order. You can't look at your own hand, but you can look at everyone else's. Giving hints.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
- Great introduction to modern board and card games. Challenging for gamers but simple to teach and learn for newbies.

- Unique combination of hidden information and cooperation

- Plays relatively quickly.


Cons:
- No expansion and the only variant is adding an extra color to up the challenge which is good but that is pretty much it.

- Players must be mindful of accidental cheating by giving extra information through table talk.

- Memory element may not be to everyone's liking. Adjusting cards in hand can help.

- The colors are a bit hard to see in low lighting and the Japanese characters are not always the easiest to use for colorblind players.


The positives of this game as a gateway game to the hobby can't be understated. Fair price and compact packaging make this an easy on-the-go game as well.

This is a decently fun cooperative card game that is quick and easy to teach. This would go great with families and friends who don't do much gaming. The only thing I don't like about the game is that, although it's cool that communication between players is limited, it's difficult to prevent non-verbal communication and other unintentional "giveaways" about what move to make (or not to make). It's not that big of a deal, but if you're bothered by ambiguous rules about what is and isn't acceptable in terms of rules or behavior, this may not be a game you would like.

Bought this game with high hopes as it was a Spiel des Jahres winner, but I haven't enjoyed it at all.  It's a co-op but instead of the group deciding on a move for each player, players have to make their own decisions.  When someone makes a mistake it can be very frustrating for other players who'd previously given that player a clue.  My wife and I just had no joy from this game.

Gave this game away with pleasure.

The only co-op game that I enjoy.

You do need the right group: you have to accept that it's only fun if you stick to the rules and don't hiss or wince if someone's reaching for the wrong card. 

If you do have the right group then the more you play the more its depth is revealed.

a well deserved and truly innovative SdJ-winner which belongs into every gamers collection if not even household. for a cooperative game there may not be that much conversation but its a fun and fast gem where peoples performance grows with more plays due to the better ability to understand the hints of other players. the included expansions increase the already high replayability even further, although we havent tried them yet. First we have to manage to create the perfect firework on the regular game..

Nice little filer game.  Portable, and easy to play anywhere.  As a person who generally dislikes cooperative games, I can say that there is something enjoyable here.  A simple task of counting to 5 made difficult by reversing the way you hold your cards.  This game fixes my main gripe with coop: the experienced players tell the others what to do.  The rules to this game make that impossible.  Not a lot of replay value once you reach a high score, even with the multicolored cards added in.  Game can easily be broken by developing a system with other players, i.e. giving subtle clues without using the clue markers.

After my first game, I couldn't decide whether I loved the game, or whether I hated it. It sure is stressful. After a few more plays, I can confirm that I love it. This is NOT a casual filler, despite it's size. It takes too long to play to be a true filler. It also requires constant attention. This is not one to play while you're trying to carry on a conversation. But I love the challenge.

Right after reading the first review of Hanabi, I knew that I wanted to own this one and my plays confirmed my suspicion. Hanabi is a great co-op with a brilliantly simple mechanic based on deduction and limited communication. By restricting the communication, Bauza managed to elimate the typical "one player rules all" problem of so many co-ops. Everyone is involved throughout the whole game, facing difficult decisions every turn. In short: I do really, really like Hanabi.

But be warned: There are some people in my play group who are somewhat cluesless when we play Hanabi and, as a result, they don't enjoy it. But for the price that this game is sold, you can even risk a blind buy. Two thumbs up for Hanabi.

My wife would rate this game a 10.  I have two problems with it that drop the score for me.  First, the amount of concentration required to play well is at odds with the weight of the game for me.  When I play a co-op I want a social experience with my friends and this game discourages casual conversation.  Second, it is group dependent.  For the best experience you want to have repeated plays with the same group and the game can be tanked by a single player not paying attention. Solid game but situational

Yes this game is easily broken, and rules can be bent all the time, but it is just a lot of fun. Every time you tally up how many points you got, the table is saying we can do better next round and is ready to go again. My wife and I love this game at two players.

A highly unique cooperative game. I enjoy it, but I don't LOVE it. For the most part it's very difficult to "win" or get a perfect game but the journey is fun.

I don't know why I have to make a seperate entry for Hanabi from Hanabi & Ikebana.  Strange.  In any case, Hanabi is a very fine game that is often made less fun by what people bring to it.  Played on its surface level, I really enjoy the "what can I tell everyone when" aspect.  However, once loaded down with conventions, conventions that truly do help you score more points, it just becomes a pointless exercise in memorization.  I much prefer to play the game cleanly and let the chips fall where they may.

Players are working together to present a high scoring fireworks display.  Cooperative game where players are dealt out a hand of cards.  Cards are in five suits, numbered between 1 and 5.  On your turn you can either play a card (blindly) from your hand (you never see what you are holding); give a hint about another player's hand; or discard a card and draw a new one.  The amount of clues that can be given is controlled by flipping a token, which can only be flipped back when a card is discarded.  Playing a card to one of the five stacks successfully is what you want - you only get two chances to be incorrect before you lose the game.  Fun game, feels quite different, but very engaging.  A cooperative game that highlights the game play, and doesn't give any power to the loudest at the table.  I liked it.

RATING: 7
The best style of co-operative game, where communication is stinted and players must work to get around this. While trying to interpret your team-mates messages can be frustrating, you can see notable improvement over replays. With a shorter cooperative like this one, you need this to encourage the players to come back to it.

RATING: 6
Not a big fan of this one.  For me, a co-op game needs a fail state that is reasonably tough to avoid.  This one doesn't give me that moment of exuberance when we "win" like most other good co-ops do.

RATING: 5
A very original mechanic, but honestly, not much fun.  This game is both very interactive yet not interactive at all because you really can’t just sit back and casually enjoy the game play with your fellow gamers.  Its a social game, yet you can’t be social during the game; you have to be focused and remain diligent the whole time which can create an uncomfortable atmosphere.   When it comes down to it, its just a memory game, that’s all.  
And almost every time we’ve played it in places without very bright lighting, there are serious problems with the colors and its hard to tell some cards apart.  Because I know Japanese, I sometimes had to rely on the kanji characters to tell the cards apart.    
I’ve found the game to be very divisive at game meets.  There are those people that want to play it over and over again, and those that despise it.  I could take it or leave it, but usually I’ll pass on playing it.

Extremely unique game by Antoine Bauza of 7 Wonders fame. It provides a true coop experience without the alpha leader problem. It plays quick and reaches a variety of audiences.

[b]1.14.13 Update:[/b] This game is still a joy every time it comes out. I love the tension and anticipation of each play. The only downside is when varied experience levels mix. Nevertheless, my rating on this one may be taking a leap upward soon.

[b]7.22.13 Update:[/b] This game continues to provide an experience not found anywhere else. Ridiculously good. Rating goes up with no ceiling in sight.

Great small cooperative game based on giving clues and on deduction, perfect to challenge team work. No leader possible. It's not a party game at all.
Just a problem with the French version: there are not enough Rainbow cards, so they can't be used as they are supposed to, like a 6th colour, but only as jokers - which means you cannot increase the difficulty…

RATING: 7
A well-designed game that's fun for many types of gamers. It can lack tension when someone discards the only remaining copy of a card. Thinking, "We can't get 25 anymore, so let's try to get 24," and then, "We can't get 24 anymore, so let's try to get 23" is less satisfying than a win-or-lose ending.

RATING: N/A
The game is all about getting the perfect score. When I first learned the game, I really don't get it why people lost to the game. I thought they lose because there did 3 mistakes (so game over) or it's just hard to figure out what card to play.

It turned out that the game is difficult due to the fact that the game ends before they could make the 5 groups of cards (to get perfect score).

Players get the idea of what cards/colours they're holding, it's just that they didn't have enough time to play it down.

So in summary, it's all about creating the 5 groups of cards in less number of turn, that's the key of the game. You waste your time, and boom the deck is finished, and you're only left with one more turn before the game completely ends.

Challenging, cooperative, counter-intuitive card game. The goal is to build stacks of fireworks of different colours but the trick is that you can not see your own cards, only those of other players. By giving simple hints in turn order during limited number of rounds you work together to collect as many points as you can. 
It is slightly difficult in the beginning to stop looking at the card when you draw.
Also, game is not easy and it is not very sociable due to limited number of information you are allowed to give to each other, but it is still fun and rewording.

[b]Update:[/b] Playing with more serious players multiple times gives a really rewarding experience. Upgraded to 8.7 from 7.5

fine family game. Build sets with the catch that only your team mates can see your hand and must spend limited resources to give you information on your cards.

Az idei SdJ nyertes. Kis kártyás volta ellenére. Nos úgy gondolom megérdemelte kisebbsége ellenére nagy játék. Nem bonyolult, logikai, dedukciós játék. (Gyakorlatilag a modern kártyás Cluedo :-).) Gyors, kényelmes partik, mondjuk figyelni kell az elszólásokra, illetve a mondatokra, de kellemes játék. Mondjuk lehetett volna közepes dobozos is, ha adnak hozzá 5 db kártyatartót :-).
A partik fél óra alatt vannak még 5 fővel is. És mivel kis játék nem is drága. (Ellentétben pl. a 2 évvel ezelőtti nyertes a Kingdom Builderssel, ami nagy dobozos játékhoz képest is k* drága)
Szóval kezdőknek, illetve profiknak le- és bevezető játéknak tökéletes, igazából teljesen megfelel ennek a jelenlegi SdJ felfogásnak: gyors szórakoztató, egyszerű.

It's weird to rate this so high given my own personal scale, but I want to give Hanabi a fair shake because it does exactly what I want it to do - provide a fun game that is highly accessible to non-gamers.  It took a long time to get this to any table, but the takers were my parents and they loved every moment of it.  For me, such a thing is incredibly precious as it allows me to share at least some aspect of this hobby with them.

Fills a niche. It's not something I turn to with a lot of alacrity at game night (preferring something longer/deeper), but it can be surprisingly entertaining. Especially adding in the extra "wild" suit, it can be a real challenge, and co-op games are a nice change of pace. It's a good game for those times where you're not really looking to commit to something long or deep - but are looking for a game nonetheless.

Every game had been great so far! Each game goes pretty fast and while it requires focus and concentration, it's not exactly intense. Simple rules that took a minute to explain; and within 2 games, we start to have our own little system to maximize our scores. The draw really affects how you play your hand, and that makes each game interesting.

whilst co-operative games would not rank amongst my favourites, contrary to popular belief, I will play them -- and this is one of the best, easy, to play and yet so difficult to master and complete -- what clues are the best -- can your colleagues pick up on your intelligent hints (and especially vice versa) -- hopefully no one will stay angry at each other at the conclusion (you gave me such a STUPID hint!) .. lovely artwork, but at times the differing colour cards tend to meld into one another -- make sure you play in absolute high lighting to distinguish colours

What an elegant cooperative game with a very unique mechanism!  Players are trying to complete fireworks in the correct (numerical) sequence and color set.  The catch is that you hold your cards facing outwards so that you can see what everyone else has, but not your own hand.  The decision of which card to play or discard must be made with the information of what another player has (or hasn't) told you about the cards you are holding.  The rules are simple, but the game is tense and exciting.  The short play time and fun will have you wanting to replay it to best your previous scores.  Definitely recommended as a great filler.

It's a co-op game and I like it, what's wrong with me? :-)

I think it's because everybody's playing, not just the few with the biggest mouths giving other players "instructions" what to do, like in many other co-op games because you can only give away one clue to one player on your turn and that's it.

RATING: 5
This is a card co-op that uses numbers and suits.  You'll have a hand of cards but you can't see your own cards, only the hand of cards the other players have.  The objective is play cards in sequential order for each of the 5 suits in the game (6 if you want to play hard mode) or as best as you can.  On your turn you choose between 1 of three options: give information to another player about their hand (which can be done sparingly), discard a card which allows you to give more information in future turns, and play a card which you need to do to win.  This is largely a memory game, but it's one of the few of that I actually enjoy.  Games are also quick and can be finished in about 20-ish minutes.  In the end it's leaving my collection because I don't like how it's usually pretty easy to "win" but extremely difficult to get get a perfect score... sick of always getting 20-ish.

Edit: Dropping the rating on this after having played Beyond Baker Street, which I consider a vastly superior product.

A neat coop game that everyone seems to get into (thanks to the fact quarterbacking is impossible). Elegant, but that's not really my thing, so has been surpassed for me by Beyond Baker Street, which has more opportunities to exercise more thinking styles - Hanabi is very much built around just tracking cards, fewer opportunities to be clever beyond that.
Also, special mention to Wig's Hanabi skills, which are another level and (slightly contrary to the above) prove that the game has more depth than we generally think.

RATING: 10
I learned this game last year (2012) at BGG.con. To me it was my favorite game I learned there. It plays out feeling a lot like the contract version of bridge, but it is much more then that. Best at four players, your work together to help each other make plays and avoid discarding vital cards. You know all the cards but your own, which makes it the best cooperative game I know (and the only one I like), avoiding a strong leader issue. The game presents itself as a constant logic problem where each player has a unique set of information.

Most people either love it or hate it. The game is incredibly deep, but beginners can play as well. Easy to learn, very hard to master. A lot of games just stop midway, so you can discuss the situation and how clues should have been given to handle it, which is awesome. The people who taught me, would write down situations that arose during to game to discuss afterwards.

If you feel the game is getting to easy (good luck), there are additional cards you can add to adjust the game play. All and all the game is great and pretty much infinitely re-playable.

After a few games, you learn to finesse plays and even bluff. Once you are really feeling good, you can try to play without table talk, or at least give shame tokens to people who might inadvertently give additional clues.

A fun experience, but once you figure out the 'language' it loses its appeal. I would recommend it to others, as its a fun puzzle to solve, but now that I've solved the puzzle, I will likely never play again. Granted, it's low price point is worth the short shelf life.

Hanabi presents one of the most interesting gaming experiences that i've had.  At first glance it is just a small deck of cards and some tokens but oh man there is a lot of game in that tiny box! Quarterbacking is eliminated since you can't really communicate which fixes the biggest flaw of co-op games! This game is really tough as well! I'm not usually a "beat your high score" kind of gamer but it is so satisfying when it happens in Hanabi!  The game also scales really well and is fun with any player count.  Oh, and it is super cheap!  Definitely a great buy!

Interesting cooperative memory game. Challenging at times, especially if you are playing with people who aren't very  good at remembering things (and with so much going on, it is sometimes hard to remember your 4-5 cards). We liked it more as a deduction game.

Co-op strategy/puzzle game that will make you think.  The game itself is rather easy to learn and play but winning it is very difficult (if you play 100% by the rules).  I enjoy the challenge but the game itself is rather dry.  This deluxe version with the dominos is much nicer but its overpriced for what it is.

Hanabi forces you to rely on your partners more than most co-operative games. I enjoyed the limited Hint mechanism. I also enjoyed how easy the game was to learn.

The scoring range gave me a less satisfying target to achieve. I prefer the tension of win/loss co-op games.

RATING: 8
Brilliant, cheap, ultra-portable short co-op.  This is best if you're going to play with the same group multiple times and have some conventions emerge to help you.  That said, it will still fascinate a thoughtful group of newbies even on their first play.

Bonus: this co-op can't be quarter-backed (i.e. one person cannot run the whole thing and boss the other players as to what their moves should be).  This is in part because the rules do not permit such communication, but is also because no one person has access to all of the information about the game state (until, perhaps, it can be deduced right at the end, when it's anyway too late).

RATING: 9
I had heard this game was amazing and -- amazingly -- it lived up to its billing. A great coop that is easy to teach and enjoyable to play thanks to the tension created by the limited allowable communication. 

We don't play it as a memory game, we allow each other to be reminded of what we've been told and we splay the discarded cards out for people to see. So far that has worked great because it puts the emphasis on deduction and educated guesses rather than memory (which we all don't seem to be interested in here). Ultimately, though, it's a communication game where everyone is vying to see who can give and pick up on the subtlest of clues.

I knock a half point off its rating for the fact that it's not possible to play the game the exact same way among different groups of people. It's tough to adjudicate what is acceptable conversation, and once somebody says something inappropriate or accidentally sees one of their cards, there's no going back.

RATING: 8
Great fun. Played ten times during the first weekend we've owned it.

4 player is fantastic, and also stands up well as a 2 player endeavour.

Games take 10-15 minutes, so it's a superb filler.

My wife and I have scored 25 on a couple of occasions, so time to move on to the multi-coloured sixth suit.

Hanabi is a beautifully elegant and simple, co-operative game that is very quick to teach and learn with a high replayability.

Games are always fun but can becomes tense, especially in the later game where every decision is crucial.

I love, love, love:
- the small size but lots of game
- the included variants
- the twist on communication and not seeing your own hand
- that we can play so many times in a small time span

I dislike:
- that it's just too easy, but we haven't tried with the more difficult mode, yet

Final verdict: Small footprint in our giant collection and always fun to play, even 2-player.

RATING: 5
This game facilitates getting to know people better.  This can be good, and this can be bad.  There's nothing more frustrating than when you've given someone a clue and they completely ignore and forget it.  On the flip side, sometimes you give obtuse clues, and people catch on to those to great success.

I like playing with people about 3 times.  After that, the game's usually done.  I have yet to get a perfect score, and I'm okay with that.

Innovative and fun. So brutal at a 2-player count, and much easier to approach that much sought-after '25' with 3-to-4 players.

This is such an excellent game.  It feels so different from any other game you'll play, which just feels so cool when you're playing it.  It's quite difficult figuring out the best clues to give or how exactly to go about giving specific information when you're forced to give more general information than you'd like, all while trying to remember what everyone else told you about your cards!  I'm always up for at least one play of this game.

I played Hanabi a long time ago so when I received Deluxe, I was definitely interested. My girlfriend loved the game as soon as we played it. The biggest thing it has over regular Hanabi is the tiles can stand up vs. holding cards out. It's far easier to sort, organize, and not-accidentally-look at your tiles as opposed to juggling a hand of cards.

[b]Sold 7/9/2017[/b] - We picked up Beyond Baker Street a while ago, and I can't imagine wanting to play the nearly-themeless "try to get the best score you can" Hanabi instead of the defined win conditions of BBS.  The original idea in Hanabi was pretty nifty, but Beyond Baker Street took that and built more of a game on top of it.

Also, one of the things that I find most frustrating about Hanabi is that it often devolves into either memorizing a specific set of rules about how to give and interpret the clues, or people trying to slyly "cheat" the rules with wink wink, nudge nudge types of hints.  BBS suffers the same problem but at least there's a bit more game to it.

RATING: 7
Really interesting co-operative game where you don't know what you hold but can see others hands. 

Relatively simple mechanically you either play a card, discard a card and gain a time, or play a time and give someone else a piece of information.

Theme could have been anything really but fireworks do fit and the fuse as a timer is suitable thematic.

This is great with 3 players but I think would be too chaotic with more than 3 and a will avoid playing with 5. 

I like the addition of several varients in the box.

This is a good game, and I feel like I should or could like this game more - but almost every I time I play at least one player gets annoyed with the others or gets too frustrated with themselves.  And I'm beginning to think it's something with the game itself rather than just purely the players.

RATING: 8
Elegant and simple. Really clever "little" cooperative game based on deduction and limited communication. I really like it and the really intense feeling that builds up during a successfull game (when somehow a kind of "bond" is created among the players). Might make for a great team-building tool, but...

... some people are, like, totally cluless in this kind of game. Can create akward situations.

Further, experience and especially common experience among a given group is important to beat the challenge; hence games grouping experienced players with newbies tend to be frustating for the formers (well, not if they play specifically to introduce the game to new players of course).

Overall, Hanabi is a very smart and fun little game that fills a void that we never knew was there : that of a short but challenging cooperative game. Further, it uses a very nice twist on the way that information is shared around the table and avoids the main drawback of classic coops : no "leader" can emerge. I like it a lot.

RATING: 8
A game that can be played at whatever depth the players want -- light and wonderfully maddening, or deep and subtle (and yes, this requires the players to agree and respect the spirit of the thing). The first thought I had after playing Hanabi for the first time was "how is it this game was not invented thousands of years ago?" Elegant, original, timeless.
An added note: Of course there is luck involved in even approaching a high score, but claiming there is more memory to the game than deduction suggests to me that those commenters weren't playing with the right group of people. The 'when' of a piece of information can be critical, and quite subtle if people are paying attention. If there's a criticism that hits home, it's about the difficulty of keeping players from divulging extra information, or at least being 'reasonable' about this sort of thing.

Pros
-innovative card game with hidden information

-requires a minimum number of players (I believe 3)
-some people might find it stressful
-game can be difficult for some groups
-game is somewhat vague on what you are and are not allowed to do in terms of giving information
-not an inherent flaw in the game, but players are expected to keep certain information secret, game can be ruined by someone who is not careful and says something

This is one of those games that's so simple and straightforward that you wonder how it didn't get invented 100 years ago.  Everyone has a hand of cards but they're held backwards so that you can't see your own, only everyone else's.  Then you work together giving each other clues about the colors and numbers on the cards so that they can be played in sequence to joint groups on the table.  I found this to be more fun than I thought it would be, but I don't think it will have the staying power that most other card games do.

The regular game is hard enough to get a perfect score in, but it also comes with some additional cards used for an advanced version.

RATING: 6
Unique cooperative card game in which players try to build straights in five different suits. The problem is that you get to see the hands of your fellow players but not your own. Players may however give a limited amount of hints to each other to help deduce the cards held.

Consequently it features a very strong memory element because you need to remember previous hints given and where you actually put those cards in your hand. It certainly is not a card game to play lightly and with only fleeting attention on the table.

RATING: 6
Forget about the theme - it could deal with a shrubberies market or larches gardens. 

Cooperative card game with ultra-simple rules, short and funny to play, although it seems impossible to win if rules are strictly followed without personal interpretations, gestures or conventions between experienced players in the same group. Anyway, I like it.

2014-03-03: Bauza's own comment nails the crux of it: how strictly you police the rules makes it easily adaptable to different groups of players. It's quick-playing, full of decisions*, extremely simple to teach, and has that vital component of being fun to play in public because it weirds people out that you're holding your hand round the wrong way. Cheap too.

*it can be frustrating those times you end up knowing nothing at all about your hand, of course, but I'm sure you can cope

EDIT, 2014-10-07: I admit, I've lost enthusiasm for this a bit since playing it for the 10x10 challenge. 8 -> 7.

I'm actually afraid of fireworks, so playing this game is probably as close as I'm going to get to building a firework show.

It's really strange not being able to look at your own cards and trying to build I nice firework by giving clear instructions.

The misunderstandings, which almost always happen when playing this game, make sure there is a lot of laughter at the table.

Multiple Owners - Antoine Bauza's genius game about guessing, tension and cooperation. Packs a surprising amount of game in and a ridiculous amount of stress. Easy to learn but always a challenge. Really important to play by the rules or the game loses it's edge.

 I highly recommend this game.  I also recommend spending a few extra dollars and get this Mahjong Style styled version.  
 
 A brilliantly clever game mechanic(you can see everyone's hand of tiles but your own). And are limited to the Color or Number information you can provide your fellow players.
 
 It works really well and can be very challenging to build the right spread of fireworks to please the crowd!

A much better game than I thought it would be. In fact it is enjoyable to play. Players do need to pay attention to all the hints given - not just their own. Also some conventions of play are needed if you are not to lose (e.g. fill from one side of your hand and discard from the other). The important thing is to not take the conventions as far as some partnership card games like Bridge (where I believe the bidding is just condoned cheating).

Many cooperative games feel like they artificially limit the sharing of information in an attempt to make them more difficult, but this one does it very naturally since it is the crux of the game.
Due to the severely limited information, it is amazing that what and when you are told information is almost equally important to the times you are given no information at all.

I am somewhat surprised to find that it plays better with fewer players (where players have more cards in hand) due to the limited information that can be shared between four or more players.

-Se aprende a jugar enseguida
-Se puede graduar la dificultad (5 colores, 6 colores, 5 colores y multicolor y cambio en el número de cartas del sexto color)
-Se puede moldear en función del esfuerzo cognitivo que se quiera hacer (por ejemplo, puede hacerse válido recordar las pistas ya dadas)
-Cuenta con reglas avanzadas que mejoran el juego (uso de finesas, convenciones acerca de la posición de las cartas nuevas y antiguas, etc)
-Ocupa muy poco espacio
-Se monta y se recoge en unos segundos
-Sin efecto líder
-Adaptado para daltónicos, gracias a los símbolos que acompañan a los colores
-Cuenta con muchas versiones (caja normal, edición de bolsillo, lata cuadrada...)

CONTRAS:
-Es necesario enfundar las cartas, ya que si una de ellas se marca inutilizará el juego
-Las cartas de la edición de lata cuadrada son muy malas de coger
-Los niños necesitarán un atril para poner las cartas y jugar con comodidad
-Si alguien dice algo que no debe o en el tono que no debe, la partida puede estropearse

"Strange little co-op game with a unique don't see mechanism which you invariably get wrong.  I this useful as an introduction quick filler, but not sure on It's replay value.  That said, should be in the standard collection (Sept 2013; rating is a harsh 6).  Actually, as a quickco-op filler, It's a bit of fun - rating increase to 7 (Nov 2013). So much better game with the deluxe verion with the tiles than the cards.  In fact, it turns it into an enjoyable family co-op (Rating: 7.354, Aug 16)."

I liked Hanabi the first time I played it as much as I thought I would: clever deduction game with a neat twist - you can't see your own cards but everyone else can. Good co-op, set collection game that's light enough for families but deep enough as a filler between meatier games.  Pretty easy-going, though keeping track of some of the clues can be a bit of a nightmare!

RATING: 9.5
This is my first review of a game because Hanabi deserves it.
Lets get the main con out of the way first.  My rating of 9.5 is because this game might (emphasis on might) have a lifespan after which I will no longer play it regularly. However, as an $8-10 game it has already surpassed my expectations by far and if I never played it again I would still be -extremely- happy with the purchase.
For clarity, my group plays this game strictly deductional, not memorization. If a clue has been given, that person can be given the information again. We try to remember on our own, but we aren't going to force the issue as long as the clue-giver remembers exactly what clue was given. This is especially helpful after playing 3 or 4 games in a row.
So, my story with Hanabi begins with an impulse buy at B&N. The wife and I played it a couple times, enjoyed it, got OK scores (16-18ish) and then shelved it for a while. We later got it out again when we needed a quick, easy closer game for game night, and from there it was magic.
We played one game, and a particularly excitable gamer in our group was determined that we would get 25, the max score.
I scoffed at this comment. We haven't even been close. We played a couple more games, and we were convinced that the cards must be in perfect order in the deck to achieve the max score. We even considered playing the game with all hands revealed just to see if it was possible (we didn't do it though, thankfully.)
Next game day, we get Hanabi out again. Obviously, we are missing something. The rules are very simple, but the game extremely deep and difficult, with clues given having effects on every player. We began to discover methods of play that allowed us to improve our score. 
My friend and I actually discussed how to beat hanabi through the week. I would go to bed, wake up at 3:30 in the morning with an idea, email my friend, and get an email back that morning with an idea he had. We were both constantly thinking about this game and how to beat it. 
After more game plays and additional "meta" rules, my friend and I are now able to achieve scores of 25 with some regularity.
This game has been a journey and a bonding experience like no other game I have ever played. The players involved are relying so much on every other player, that you actually feel like you must cooperate. This is team building at its absolute best.

Here's a semi-rant on angry alpha-male type players and their relation to Hanabi.
This game builds trust. Alpha male know-it-alls must take a chill pill and learn to trust their teammates. If you are this person, you will want to kill your partner the second they discard a card you told them was important. What you don't know is that they know you have the same card. And if you were so darn smart, you'd know that too. You'd also know that if they had been saving the card, and suddenly discarded it, it probably means you JUST picked the same card up. But you're too busy being mad that they discarded the card to think about the possible implications of that decision. 
The above rant is also an excellent indication of the type of "meta" rules and deduction that I believe Hanabi is all about.

Despite the fact that my group can now get 25 on a fairly regular basis, Hanabi did not end for us. No, not by far. The game comes with a 6th "multi" color firework card set. We play with only 1 of each numbered card of the multi-color set, raising the total possible score to 30. This is (I believe) the hardest version of the game, and we are still trying to work out the puzzle. Every game, even if we make a mistake early, is a deduction struggle to get the best possible score we can.

TL;DR
Hanabi is an awesome team building, trust building, easy to learn/hard to master game.
Find a group of people to regularly play with, KNOW that 25 is possible, and figure out how to do it!
Then, move on to the more advanced versions of the game, and try to do it again.

WAY to easy to ruin the game by accidentally putting your cards down the wrong way or looking at a card when you draw or a host of other flubs.  But in the end, it's just a weird Who-Am-I-group-Solitaire.  I like the subtlety of WHY someone gave you that particular information at that particular time, but in the end, it's just building a pile of numbered cards.  The box makes it sound exciting, "Race the Clock... Launch Your Rockets".  In play, there is minimal excitement, and I don't find myself caring if any of us screw up.  "Take Your Time... Play a Card".  Or don't.  On the flip side, this game can be VERY stressful to those who are sensitive to feeling like they have let the group down.  But that won't be me.

RATING: 6
Players do not look at their own hand of cards but rather hold them up for all the other players to see. Players then give clues to which card a player should play to the table - cards need to be played in numerical order by colour - play a card out of order or one that has already been played and everyone loses.

A guessing/clue giving game with Ok components.

I am a little surprised at the love for this game - an Ok party game.

One of my favourite co-op games. I could see how playing this super super strictly could lead to just sitting in almost complete silence, but if you're a little more relaxed about table talk then it's a fun experience. You will develop your own signals (almost bridge-style) if you keep playing with the same group, which presents many opportunities for people to mess up by interpreting them incorrectly.

11/17/15: I've played this 2p, 3p, and 4p. It's always worked, although 2p has a nim-ish aspect to clue-giving that must be taken into account.

Overall, this is a quality game. I like the communicative aspect, particularly trying to get messages across to your teammate within the boundaries of the rules. I'm sure that if you played it with a group long enough, you'd get pretty good at it.

Not as fun if somebody in your group likes to cheat, even subtly.

Simple rules, simple gameplay, agonizing fun! Even if your memory isn't perfect, you can take a chance and add to the suspense by laying down a card you ... think ... is ... right.

Tacked this on to a bulk order rather than pay shipping costs (which would have been the same as buying this game). Turns out it is everything my family hates in a game. Relies heavily on short term memory, has artificial limits on how you can communicate. Ugh.

The wife loves this one. I kind of think of it as about the meanest cooperative game to ever exist since players often get frustrated with their forgetful teammates. It's frustrating but inventive. UPDATE: Beyond Baker Street has totally replaced this game for me. I doubt I will ever play Hanabi again.

Bought at Essen 2012. So glad it won Spiel des Jahres - well deserved. A pure and timeless cooperative game. You can get really good at it with one group of people, then start all over again with someone new. And then - you can introduce the 6th colour!

Two things that usually put me off: cooperative and memory. Yet I love it.

Mysteriously lost my copy sometime in the latter half of 2015, along with [thing=5782][/thing]. One of the risks of running [guild=1459][/guild]. New copy obtained in August 2016 UK maths trade.

This game is hard to win.

I like it a lot as a filler, and I've certainly gotten my 8 dollars worth out of it.

We had a 2 month run where we pretty much played it at least once a week.

I can't see not picking this game up if you don't have it or people you know and play games with don't have it.  It's not going to be outdated and plays in a variety of groups.

RATING: 9
Elegantly solves the core problem that plagues most cooperative games by making the information exchange a core mechanic. (In most cooperative games, when players share enough information to play effectively a dominant analytical player will be able to tell everyone else what they need to do to win -- making the game less than cooperative. Some games try to solve this with traitors -- at which point they aren't really cooperative games anymore, frustrating levels of randomness, or clunky artificial restrictions -- which most players largely forget or ignore.)

The square cards in the "Second French Edition" are annoying because players (who can't see them) have to hold them in a specific orientation so their teammates can read them. New players have to continually be reminded to rotate the backs to a specific orientation.

RATING: N/A
This is a wonderful game for people who like a challenge. We have tried to play it with a few different groups of people but generally, I find new players find it too stressful to be fun. My partner and I have played countless hours of this game together and still find it challenging and enjoyable. I think we've probably only ever played a perfect game once so the challenge doesn't lessen with time (at least not for us). Great to test communication and memory.

Hanabi is a cooperative game of encoded communication, deduction, memory, and risk management. The players have to play their cards to the center of the table in a very specific order. But you must hold your cards so that everyone can see them except for you. As a group, you must figure out how to signal each other about which cards to play or discard. And there are very strict rules about what you are allowed to say, and when you are allowed to say it. You'll often feel like you don't have enough information to make a smart play. But that's what gives the game its wonderful tension. Hanabi is an absolutely brilliant game design, totally different from any other cooperative game on the market. The night I first cracked it out, we played seven times! The ultimate cooperative game for nerds? Probably

Mine is the early "Hanabi & Ikebana" version, and I do strongly prefer the rectangular to the square cards.

Brilliant concept which deconstructs the main mechanic of card games: you cannot see your own cards. Hilarity ensues. According to the rules you cannot convey any sort of information other the number and color of cards, but when playing with friends it's almost impossible not to bend the rules in one way or another. It doesn't matter, breaking the rules (or trying hard not to) is part of the fun.

I can't decide if this is a 5 or a 1. The meta-game in my group was fine to a point, but then it's still all up to the deck. The challenge is then stretching the meta beyond a simple 'one command-one play' turn, but still feels like you're just following a pre-set rule. This game is more fun when you're figuring out what the meta should be, and then playing a few games to realize the meta at its full potential. Once you've done that, the game just becomes a process.

I think I underrated this game initially. After 18 months not playing it, it hit the table and I forgot how good it is. The tension in this game is palpable. At least five times during the game, you are going to wish you were someone else and can give a certain clue or say a certain thing. And at least 2x during the game, it will come to your turn and you will have a) no information about your hand and b) no clues to give, forcing you to play a card or discard a card randomly. It doesn't get more fraught with tension than that.

Components are excellent: functional, beautiful, sturdy, and the tin box is very portable which is a plus in my book. Even if the box doesn't perfectly close.

My favorite game!  I love cooperative games, and this is one of the few that can't be played solo, so I don't get to play it nearly often enough.  I love playing with advanced players to make a run for the perfect score (only once so far), but I also love teaching new players and watching them catch on to what is happening....  Plays very differently (but still well) with different player counts.  It's great to play "seriously" when people have enough skill, but can be a hoot when played with looser rules.

This game turns set collection on it's ear. Everyone else knows your hand, but you don't, and you know everyone else's hand.

Innovative and awesome!

RATING: 9
Brief it may be, but don't call this awesome game "filler". Forget chrome, this is [i]pure, undiluted game[/i]. In this co-operative game, communication is key - you don't know what cards you have, and your team-mates must inform you, one piece of information at a time. Don't worry about the memory aspect: this is primarily a game of logic, communication, and laughter when someone messes up.  Memory plays a role, but it's also up to your team-mates not to over-burden you with information. It's wonderfully tense, full of cheers and groans as things go your way, or not. Hanabi is versatile as a Swiss Army Knife: it supports 2-5 players, and plays in  less than 30 minutes. Just get it, OK?

I bet this would rise in rating if I played it more with the same people.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better with smaller group, interesting and unique. I like it a lot more than I thought I would and it's a simple enough game that I can play with my mom too. Mechanically it's pretty good.

Too clunky with big groups and a bit dull/dry with an irrelevant theme. My main issue is that it's not as satisfying as some other co-op games because it's not so absolute in conclusion. Falling somewhere on a spectrum is just not quite as nice as "winning".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Call me unreconstructed but Hanabi lacks the 'take that-I win you lose' aggro that excites an old cardboard warrior like me.  This is an abstract co-op.  The theme extends only as far as the artwork on the box.  And strangely for a co-op table talk is limited.  To be fair, there are always a few amusing moments-sighs, groans, congratulations or recriminations, but it struggles for my love against a myriad of more enjoyable options.  Ask me if you want suggestions.
 
It would remain in a dusty corner of a cupboard if it wasn't for my teenage boys.  Despite all the paper capers that they could indulge in they want to play this.  And my wife likes it, so there!

A really nice twist on the co-op game concept that is so popular lately. Every player is dealt a hand of cards, but must hold them so that everyone but the owner can see them. Then, in turn, players either give clues or play cards. Doing well depends on giving clues well, but also remembering and figuring out what those clues mean. A really nice exercise in logic that doesn't last too long.

played once with 4 and once with 2. Didn't finish either game - not because we weren't having fun but because we didn't have enough time. Thought the game would be quicker than it turns out...very nice core concept - very good at pushing players to develop and adapt a way of communicating that will work within constraints. Essentially, it seems to me that it's about always thinking - why would it be important that i receive this information RIGHT NOW...given how limited the communication resource is - it should be considered precious and should be dwelled upon and given weight beyond the literal info signified. maybe it is an indication to discard - or to play ---and not knowing which is tense and cool.

This is a fantastic game with 4 or 5 players. I have yet to play it with fewer. But, we had a blast playing this at the cabin. However, it is nearly impossible not to "cheat" at this game. It just happens when you are attempting to tell another player what kind of information they should give. It is a hilarious mix of you should tell THAT person something, and then THAT person will know more information, and should be able to play a card. But, then if THAT person plays it leaves the next person to discard, and I'm not so sure if that's such a great idea. This game just provides a great mix of strategy and hilarity. For less than $10 everyone should grab a copy.

Very simple cooperative game centered on a mildly interesting mechanic: you cannot see your own cards and depend on hints of the other players to know what to play or discard.

A fémdobozos kiadást vásároltuk meg és gyönyörű ez a kiadás: szép grafika, jó mínőség (a magyar szabály is).
Az évek alatt egyik kedvenccé nőtte ki magát. Nagyon tetszik, hogy csak a saját lapjaidat nem látod és a többiek által adott jelek, információk alapján hozol döntést, építed fel a tűzijátékot a "parasztok" részére.
Van, aki elpoénkodja a játékot és rengeteget szövegel, de ez nálam a komoly, inkább hallgass és gondolkodj el a nyomokon játék, így a megfelelő partnerekkel imádom. A végén majd nevetünk és átbeszéljük a fordulót.
Könnyen tanítható, de csak több játék után kapsz rá az ízére, mechanikájára. Minden elpocsékolt nyom nagy veszteség! :)

Para mi Hanabi es el mejor juego de su autor Antoine Bauza. Un solitario colaborativo que cuenta con la deducción aparte del azar para intentar concluirlo con éxito.

Un juego que resulta muy divertido por el grado de confusión que los jugadores pueden sufrir y el riesgo que hay que correr.

Un juego muy de moda a finales de 2011 para terminar sesiones de juego o para probarlo con jugadores ocasionales.

cada jugador no ve sus cartas, ve las de los demas, y tiene que indicarles a los demas que cartas deben jugar... con unas limitaciones. 

a partir de ahi... un desafio a la memoria y al intelecto de los jugadores. y unas risas... dios mio. el mayor ataque de risa que me ha dado en un juego ha sido a Hanabi. 

Excelente y muy aconsejable filler. 

pd. en su primera edicion internacional, este juego venia junto con otro juego (este, competitivo) que utiliza la misma baraja de cartas y un numero mayor de tokens, llamado ikebana. Por algun motivo al cabo de los años ikebana desapareció, y la caja y las cartas fueron rediseñadas para emparejarlas tematicamente con Hanabi. 

pero sigue siendo posible, añadiendo unos cuantos tokens, jugar a "ikebana" usando la baraja de hanabi. :D

Another winner by Bauza. Solid solid solid coop card game. Fresh mechanics with the backwards hands, plays incredibly well with all number of players, and there is a ton of meta gaming in not cheating in how you give clues. It's very nerve racking, but in the best way. Great decisions and difficult enough. Addictive as all get out. Will play this game in most situations.

One of the co op games where you really need each person to work together but at the same time, each person needs to be active and aware. What I mean is that, some co op games, you may have a role but other people can make decisions for you so sometimes it feels like the most vocal person is controlling the flow. However in Hanabi, you have to decide what clues to give, other players can hint suggestions but in the end its up to you. And it's so satisfying when things work out and very frustrating when it doesn't and everyone will have the same feeling at the end of the game "I reckon we can do better than that, lets try again!". Solid Co-Op game.

Such a simple idea, but I haven't experienced anything quite like this. This is true cooperation, where you really are trying to work together. It's super tough, but it rewards replaying with the same players over and over, which is great. I like that you have to take calculated risks here that can affect the entire game. Super fun, and unique.

RATING: 9
I've often said that co-op games aren't my favorite. There is a sense in which they must necessarily be either a pure puzzle, purely random, or somewhere in between. Hanabi answers that particular complaint by essentially being a puzzle, but hiding a different part of the information from each player. 

This is an inspired solution, and it also serves to eliminate any of the Alpha Dog problems that can plague other co-ops. Even if you see someone do something you think is dumb, it may not be, simply because you don't have all the information. 

Along those same lines, when someone plays a card that makes the team lose, it is never that player's fault. Rather, the rest of the team failed in their responsibility to give information to that player. This leads to very few "feel-bad" moments.

More than perhaps any other co-op, Hanabi rewards players who practice together and learn each others styles and conventions. It is brutally difficult to win, which makes it extremely satisfying when it happens. It's so quick-playing though, that an early loss simply leads to feelings of "let's give it another shot". 

Having the players hands backwards is such a simple change, so easy to understand, but with implications that are so deep. My favorite thing to do when explaining the game is to wait to tell players that their hands are backwards until very late in the explanation. The look on their faces is priceless. 

This game has tension, teamwork, accessibility, affordability, portability, and depth. Sure to be a classic for years to come.

A cooperative card game, would have thought! Quite weird not to be able to look at your own cards. Tests your natural inclination to pick up a card and look at it. Almost makes you think you are playing Indian poker, though luckily you don't have to hold cards on your forehead and look like an idiot. Mind twister as you try to remember your teammates clues and hope you correctly interpret their intentions.

Hanabi is a deceptively simple cooperative game which introduces an element which addresses the "alpha/leader" problem in a rather creative and effective manner - you can see everyone else's cards but your own. To make things more interesting, the primary resource in the game is hints so it becomes an impossibility to gather the perfect information required to implement such alpha/leader behaviour. As a result, the game becomes one of cooperation, memory, deduction, and calculated risk/reward. It's the perfect length for the type of game it is and doesn't overstay its welcome (if anything it understays and has you desiring more - a feature that designers should strive for more), is boiled down to its singular mechanism and not convoluted with unnecessary bells and whistles, and is aesthetically pleasing.

This was an earlier add to our collection and the mechanic of holding your cards so you can't see them was and still is mind-blowing. What an ingenious idea! It really forces good quality communication to get this co-op done well. It also plays fairly quickly with a lot of frustrating fun.

A nice, tense brain burner. It's a great social game, but hard to play when you just want casual conversation, because you will forget every single hint that was tactfully delivered to you by your partners, and they will be frustrated.

It is really hard to not cheat in this game. You need very high quality of understanding of each other. If you don't you will loose in no time, the BoardGameAreana method is working really well, but it needs time to consume in real person. You need to memorise a lot of things, i think it is implemented better at BoardGameArena becouse of this. The basic idea is welcome, but i think this shouldn't be the game of the year of 2013. I feel that it can become boring fast, while i can see high replay value.

Pros / Cons:
-It is cheap, which means the price / value is good.
-You need very high quality of understanding each other.
-You need to think over such situations they aren't the clearest thing sometimes.
-The new aspect of using cards are welcome.

-The game can get boring really fast.
-Is this a theme after all? Because it feels so flat, it doesn't even there.

One of the more interesting co-op games I have tried.  I would like to play it in a group who wants to play by the silent rule, wherein you can only talk to state your action or when spending an advice token.  In the time I played, there were many cheating-type visual cues that made it a bit easier than it normally would be, and drain a bit of the brain-burning logic.

Very unique though, like indian poker with a group goal.  It's nice to have the rainbow deck to mix things up if the base game gets old.

Hanabi is a fantastic co-op that completely eradicates the alpha-gamer syndrome which turns many people off of co-ops. Due to the way one's hand needs to be visible to the rest of the table but not to one's self it is significantly easier to play/enjoy with the deluxe version's domino like pieces than with the standard cards.

I love the brilliant ingenuity that is Hanabi. The game is very well balanced and is as complex as you want it to be, you can have fun casually building small fire works while watching TV, or you can step it up and go for the macーdaddy of all fire works and try to get a perfect 25. 
Great game for playing with new and experienced players.

Quick, easy to learn, and challenging. I think your mileage with this game depends entirely on whether your group is okay with half-allowing non verbal forms of communication (read: cheating). 

Without cheating through facial expressions, this game can be dry and very challenging. With cheating the game is hilarious because youre watching your friends and family contort their faces to tell eachother "yes that card, no no. Dont pick that one!". Its almost as if its two games at once, depending upon who you play with (somewhat like Carcassonne).

I forgot how much I enjoy Hanabi until we played it at a dinner party recently. It's a unique little cooperative deduction game and one of Bauza's best games overall. The only fault of the game is that it's impossible to shut a group up and table talk will inevitably leak information. It's still a good game despite that though and challenging enough that even if a group does "cheat" then they still probably won't get a perfect score.

Best with 4-5 and good with 3-5

(07/04/2014) Comment based on 5 plays.

Surprisingly simple, yet provocatively sophisticated Indian-poker-like cooperative card game, that plays quickly in about 20 minutes.

The players are dealt 4-5 cards, where the cards are ranked 1-5, in five different colored suits. Distribution of rank within each suit: 3x 1s, 2x 2s/3s/4s, and 1x 5. The objective is to play out cards in sequence from 1 to 5 in each of the suits.

Each player in turn has three options: 1) Give information about another player's hand (either point out exactly what cards have a specific rank, or specific color), 2) Play a card, that starts a new suit or plays in sequence with a started suit, or 3) Discard a card. In play or discard, the hand is refilled with a new card. What is especially interesting is that there are 8x timer chits. If giving info, a chit is consumed, while discarding, a chit is generated. If no chits are available, a player must either discard a card or attempt to sequence.

However, if a player plays a card out of sequence (you can only have one sequence for each of the five suits), a "fuse" chit is removed--three strikes and you're out!

This is a fascinating co-op, that does not suffer from the "alpha wolf" syndrome of a single experienced player hijacking the game, and telling everyone else how to play their roles. Instead, each player is an equal, and strict communication rules level the playing field. There is a sense of accomplishment when most of the fireworks go off in sequence, and a sense of failure when the team scores poorly, or if the three penalty chits are used up and the team scores zero points. Simple rules and components hide the fact that this is one fast, yet deep card game. It is a solid "7", with room to move up. It is definitely one of the "great" 20-minute fillers to come out in the last ten years.

(04/02/2015) Update after 20 plays. The game has fizzled with my group, who are mostly medium-to-heavy weight gamers, but still popular with any new player I introduce this game to. There is controversy about what constitutes cheating, but the game needs to be played strictly by the rules for it be great. Any winking, physical gesture, tonality, etc., is cheating, and spoils the fun. The greatness comes from pure deduction, based solely on the clues, the cards that you can see, and the discards. It is almost like Bridge, where it takes a lot of gray matter to figure out what cards you yourself have, and some creative thinking to give the maximum amount of information in the fewest clues. Of course, sometimes the order of the cards are against you, and no amount of intelligent or intuitive play will help. We also just found out that there is one other way to give a clue, which is indicating that a hand has none of a color or a rank--this method could finally allow us to get the elusive 25 points! Conventions, such as "I will put my newest card to my left, and discard first from my right most card," are perfectly acceptable, as such conventions will occur naturally in the course of many plays. However, the use of artificial "conventions", such as "you have no 5's" meaning that all of your cards are safe to discard, or that rearranging your hand during someone else's turn to signal, is in my opinion against the spirit of the game.

A játékon könnyen lehet röhögni, de nehéz szabályosan játszani. Egyébként teljesen szabályosan valószínűleg egy unalmas memória kártya. De igazából éppen ezért nem is tetszett, nem vágyom rá, hogy többször játsszak vele. Indokolatlan a jelölése az év játéka díjra.

----
Most már meg is nyerte én pedig lejátszottam a második játékomat vele. Ez kevésbé volt szórakoztató inkább túl komoly. Egy kártyáról akkor tudsz biztosít, ha meg kapod mindkét információt róla (szín és szám) a játék nagy részében legfeljebb egy-két kártyádról van bármiféle információ, tehát inkább találgatunk. A lerakott, eldobott és a többiek lapjai segítségével a találgatáshoz ad támpontot. Ez viszont nem a könnyed. szórakoztató játékok ismertetője.

Rating this game, I had to consider the overall playing experience, rather than just my opinion of the game.  I like the game quite a bit—if I only ever played with good players, I'd rate it a 9.

"A game of trust and communication."

Co-op. You hold your cards backwards so you can see everyone's cards except your own. The goal is to play all five colors in order of #1-5.

Playing 5 player is tricky to play all cards and 2 player takes a different mindset, but the game can be fun with any player count. I always play with the mindset of "why was that clue given to that person at that time?". Usually the clue is to play the card, but sometimes it is a bluff or a finesse. Very fun stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A cooperative card game where you hold your cards facing away from you and must play based on the limited info given by your fellow players or give one of your fellow players some limited info.  If you strictly follow the rules about table talk then this game avoids the usual problem of cooperative games where a dominant player makes all the decisions.  On the other hand it is hard to keep quiet.

This is a weird case where I feel like my rating (6) kind of undersells how much I like the game. I do enjoy it, but more as a kind of showpiece to new or casual gamers ("Hey, look at this crazy thing games do now!") than as something I want to pull out and play on a regular basis. But it works pretty well as an easy to teach gateway.

While the central mechanic of you-can't-look-at-your-own-hand is interesting, it doesn't hold up for what seems to be almost a cooperative solitaire game. Fans of classic, 52 card deck games will likely love Hanabi, but for me it just didn't feel like there was much at stake. Once we burned a 5 and knew we couldn't get a perfect score the game just became sort of a "let's see how many points we can make this time" sort of deal.

This is about as good as I could imagine a microgame getting. It's quick, interesting, challenging, and easy to teach. It tends to appeal to people who haven't yet been converted to the church of boardgames, and is a great gateway game. It is one of the few cooperative games that very effectively limits quarterbacking. Kudos to Bauza.

RATING: 4
Wholly unremarkable. Well, that isn't entirely true. It takes two game types I absolutely deplore, memory and deduction games, and puts them together into something I will probably try once or twice more before attempting a trade. But all told, this game is way too easy to convention or group think away the challenge. I suspect this game is only okay with a given group for the first play or two. After that, you would have put together too many rules of engagement for how and when to do what.

Played this with a Hanabi veteran and two other newbies. It was fun the first time but I think it has very little replay value. If you play it strictly by the rules, it gets to be ritualistic because you are just solving a simple logic puzzle. If you play it in a social way it's good for a laugh, but since the puzzle is exactly the same every time, playing in the same group will also become ritualistic because you'll get to know each other too well. I think it's a fantastic game for kids because it's a logic puzzle that's all about cooperative problem solving. It's also a nice ice-breaking game for people you don't know well since it encourages you to talk to each other. It's just too simple and unvaried for adults who game together regularly.

Cooperative card game where you can see everyones hand except your own.  As a rule I generally don't like cooperatives, but this is fast play, simple, some luck involved, and over fast (20 minutes).  English rules by RnR Games Inc in a nice small cardboard box.

Beyond Baker Street is a very similar game but with a much better theme linked to solving a crime.  Better than Hanabi, but not enough that I'd want to get it.

Played this game more back then. We still play it occasionally and I really like how quick it is explained so that you can have it as a filler with different groups. It doesnt feel all too satisfying most of the times for me as we never get the perfect play although we play quite well and we dont mess up too often as well. So most of the time the result does not reflect how well the group did.

Hanabi is a simple cooperative card game. The goal of the game is making beautiful fireworks. The main mechanics of Hanabi are memory and deduction. Players can provide limited chances of clues to each other. Players have to make set collections of card with climbing numbers. Hanabi is easy to learn and provides certain fun to every game participants.

Finally got this game from german amazon, all the way to australia. Glad I did. It's basically a better version of another game in our group that occasionally gets table time 'code 777'.

It really offers something different to our collection.

Wonderful game. However with the rules of chopping block and cluing playable cards and other nuances and "hidden" rules the game becomes fairly simple. Also getting the perfect score requires luck which is fine but doesn't feel satisfying when you know it's not possible to create a firework when that last card is the 2 you need to further the deck. While the original mode is simple increasing the difficulty by adding variation makes this game more fun despite the hidden rules and nuances.

RATING: 3
Cooperative card game in which you don't know what cards you have been given, but must work it out based on clues given to you by the other players.  

It's a challenge (but also fun) to keep track of the knowledge that all the players have of their cards in order to properly give the 'hints' that are central to the game.  My problem with this game, however, is the human aspect of it:

It's far too easy to give (often accidental) clues about what card the other players should play, or to accidentally tell everyone what you can remember about what has been mentioned about your own cards.  The only proper way to avoid it is basically to sit in silence while playing, this (in my opinion) is not what games are about and it's a shame because this is a pretty solid little game.

Still would recommend this as a filler, not the best game for situations where active socialising is desired.

I've had mixed experiences so far. First of all, you need the right group. Some people I've played with simply didn't comprehend the concept of a cooperative game. Plus, I don't think I've really, truly had fun playing it yet. 

It's really difficult. It depends on everyone in the group making good decisions, since it largely prevents meaningful collaboration free of the limitations set by the rules. I have yet to win the game with a score of 25!

Hanabi can be a very tense game, for this reason people will sometimes allow their emotions to show during other player's turns. When someone has to discard and they start running their fingers over their hand looking for a reaction from the crowd and everyone looks scared to death so they decide to give a clue instead.
Any game that can cause adults to act like children is a winner in my book, although it can sometimes turn into a cheat fest.

Was really looking forward to this one from what I read about it but somehow it kinda of fell flat, and the other 3 players I played with wanted to abort so we did (they felt frustrated, maybe weren't in the right mood for this one which I think you need to be somewhat alert). I found it interesting especially the unique and unintuitive twist of not seeing your own cards however the game seemed a touch weird (but I think that came from us just trying to learn the "game"). 

When I read the rules I felt I was missing something, I doubled checked and checked questions on BGG and nope was not. I mean one turn you tell someone all their red cards, next turn someone else tells them they have two 3's and if one is red, it doesn't leave much deduction. However after playing I do see how better examples of deduction can come into play and it definitely seems from reading some of the comments we didn't get 'into' the game properly as such, so want to and will need to play again.

Je ziet enkel de kaarten van de anderen, niet die van jezelf. In je beurt kan je ofwel 1) iemand een tip geven (kleur of cijfer van zijn kaarten), 2) een kaart wegleggen en een nieuwe trekken van de trekstapel, waardoor er een tip meer gegeven mag worden, of 3) een vuurwerkkaart uitspelen.

Interesting little game, I'd like to play it more. Even though you could argue that there are memory aspects and I've made it clear below that I really don't like those, there's so little to keep track of that I don't mind it at all.

When that's not the case it can get a little frustrating as it seems you may have wasted a turn when the person doesn't do what you expect them to or worse, they forget what you even said.

Hanabi is easy enough for new players to understand, but it really shines when playing with experienced players. The game is quite challenging, so it's all about learning how each player communicates using the limited language of the game.

It's a game I don't mind teaching, but I vastly prefer to play with veterans so we can make a run at (and perhaps eventually score) that elusive 25.

I got this game after my wife and I played it with another couple.  This is a fantastic double date night game! It is also a huge hit with families (especially one's who don't like having losers).  My mom is currently obsessed with this game. Definitely would recommend getting a copy.

Solves all the dominating leader problems of ordinary coops by limiting conversation. This is brilliant as a gateway game or for non gamers and I've yet to see any other game do what it does anywhere near as well. A well deserved winner of the spiel des jahres and in my opinion a modern classic.

For a co-operative game this goes against everything that I'd want when co-operating. Sure, we've all got a common goal. But when it's my turn no one can tell me that I'm about to do a really bad mistake. I like helping people out and I really struggle to see other people forget things. I found it really frustrating that I had to just shut up and I ended up burying my head in my hands for the game since I wasn't capable of watching other people when it was their turn. I don't understand why so many people love this game, it's really not for me.

Fun and original co-op game. Avoids the loudest/dominant player tells everyone else what to do situation often prevalent in co-ops through players not knowing what their own cards are (just what the others hold), and through strict rules on what can be communicated by players to each other.

It's pretty simple, but every player must think for themselves about what information they give to the others, and pick up on the meaning behind the clues the others give.

This game can be a bit frustrating. I thought I had a good memory until I played this game and kept losing track of what clues I'd been given about certain cards. It was also very annoying watching other players forget and lose track of their cards. I think 2 player is quite difficult and you need a few more players so you have more information.

Hanabi, named for the Japanese word for fireworks, is a challenging cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order. Trouble is, it's dark out, so you can't really see what you are working with. Each player holds their cards so that only the other players can see them. They must give each other vital information and remember all the information received. Then use the information to choose which cards to play. Helping each other play the right cards at the right time is the key to creating an unforgettable show and avoid being booed by the audience.

2013-07-28 - This is a really interesting cooperative card game, with a decent tension level, and some great decisions. The token limit for hints gives you a constant feeling of trying to catch up. Very fun. That said, the scoring system (a bit like the golf tee jumping game at Cracker Barrel) is little... Scoring is a competitive thing. I think the game should simply be: lay out 5 colored straights, if you fail, you lose. The idea that you still win if you come up short, but you may get a lower score, is a little silly.

2017-11-06 - This is one of the few cooperative games in my collection, and it's great for playing with newer gamers. I'll probably only pull it off the shelf for them, though, so I'm lowering my rating from a 7.5 to a 6.

Hanabi is an innovative concept for a game, and one that works well for a quick, light play. The group dynamics and decisions are what shine here. It can be prone to cold memorization, so it's best not to take it too seriously. It has that "let's play again and see if we can do even better" feel. A welcome, novel contribution to the hobby.

I like this game, but it has stressed us out at times. Once people grasp the concept they seem to want the stretch the rules. I don't mind, I think a game should be fun for all involved. O.K., I do mind. I think the rules in this one create the challenge, and that challenge is what makes this game fun in my opinion.

Incredibly fun and challenging game! Easy to teach and quick to play.  Works great with 2 to 5 players, but is probably best with 3-4.

Super challenging new game with a VERY unique dynamic: you don't see the cards in your hand, so you have to rely on hints from other players as to what to play… but there are only a limited number of hints available to do it. Runs fairly quick, requires you to keep track, all players need to participate fully… it's not very strategic or requiring luck, but controlled risk. It works tremendously well. A great starter game or night finisher.

BIG PLUS: intensity, ease of learning
PLUS: low cost, playing time sneaks up on you
MINUS: concentration required

Hanabi is a frustrating, but satisfying cooperative game.  Having limited knowledge all the way throughout makes for an interesting experience.  It's almost as players learn a language as they play, and multiple things can be discovered on one single clue if given at the right time.  I like it and look forward to exploring it further.

Brainburner! Have only played 2p so far, but that works well. UPDATE: Played with both 3 and 4 and it scales amazingly well. Still a brainburner, you will know less about your cards with more players, but the cards get cycled faster, so difficulty felt similar, only the focus changed a bit. Very good game. Theme is stupid though and the artwork isnt evocative in any way. 
Lowered my rating a bit after more plays. A different ending than just seeing how many points you can get would have more longevety I think. Now that it won the SdJ, one can only hope...

RATING: 6
Co-op card game that comes in a small box, is cheap to purchase and has an innovative idea: reversing cards hold in hand. If playing very strict using just logic and deduction, you'll quickly run short on hints, even when hints have a high information density. So this game quickly turns into a game of exploiting meta game information; thereby increasing information density per hint. For example: "this is a 3", means "this is a 3 you can play", when the game is in a stage where there is just one color where a 3 can be played. The necessity to exploit meta game information to perform well reflects my rating for this game. As does the memory element in the game (no fun, chore!) and the impact of randomization in card order for final scoring.

2015-05-21: I've played a few more times. This can be a little hard to get a larger group to play. The game play is still solid and it is very challenging to get an excellent score. That being said, I feel like the very thin theme on this one doesn't help to draw people into the experience.

2015-01-16: Initial rating as 8. I purchased this one b/c I knew it has won awards and it was very cheap. I played 1 3-player game, where we lost and 1 2-player game, where we finished with a score of 21. Overall, a very good experience.

Éste es un cooperativo cortito donde los jugadores tienen que tratar de completar sets.

Tendreis que completar 5 sets de fuegos artificales en 5 colores distintos con cartas del 1 al 5, cada una de su número y color.

El problema es que cada jugador puede ver las cartas de los demás pero no las suyas propias. En ese punto es cuando el juego cooperativo tiene lugar, los jugadores deben ayudar a los otros dándoles pistas para poner en juego las cartas correctas. Estas pistas pueden ser sobre un color ó sobre un número pero no ambas a la vez.

Al final de la partida los jugadores ganarán puntos dependiendo de los sets que hayan completado.

Reglas sencillas, gran juego. Es impresionante cómo se puede olvidar prácticamente toda la información sobre tus cartas en sólo unos segundos.

This a cooperative short game where players try to complete sets.

All of you will have to complete 5 fireworks sets in 5 different colours with cards form 1 to 5 one of each number and colour.

The point is each player can see the cards of the rest of the players but not his/her own cards. At that point is when cooperative game takes place, players should help the others to put down the right cards by providing them clues. These clues can be about a colour or about a number but not both at the same time.

At the end of the game players will score points depending of their complete sets.

Simple rules, great game. It's amazing how you can forget almost everything about your cards in only a few seconds.

Fantastic game. Made a few custom decks before it was available in USA. I've since picked up the retail R&R version and am disappointed in the graphic design of the cards. Who thought it was a good idea to make the background of every card blue with a small, colored number in the corner? It makes a lot more sense to have the background of the card be the "suit" color. Ah well, I'll stick with my own sets and be happy.

An original idea, turning the cards around to face your teammate. Some interesting choices, but I ran into a few cases where we had high cards and couldn't get any fireworks going. Can be frustrating with someone that can't think logically or remember what they have in hand. Not sure this game has enough replayability to keep me interested.

Much better with 4.

Every time I play this, I feel like this would be better if there was more deduction going on. Players constantly reveal more information than the rules require, at no fault of their own. It just happens.

It truly is a game of frustration.

I love deduction games.  With two players, I find this to be a great brain burner.  The secret is the finesse.  New cards go in one side of your hand, discards go out the other side.  Then your partner knows which card you are getting ready to discard.  With that mevhsism, a 25 is posdible, but still very difficult.  Love the game, but you have to find someone who also loves deduction as much as you do, otherwise it's a bust.

This is really nice co-op game in which you do not see your hand of cards, but the other players see them. You can only give clues on which cards are a certain number or a certain color.

Great, small co-op game! Pretty tough though...both to beat and to not accidentally cheat!

Un juego diferente a lo habitual: solo con cartas, cooperativo ¡y que se juega con las cartas al revés! Una idea muy original y que resulta francamente adictiva. Siempre queremos jugar otra para mejorar nuestra puntuación, y provoca mucha tensión cuando alguien debe descartarse de una carta sin tener demasiada idea de lo que tiene en mano. Muy bueno.

I'm not a fan of cooperative games. But I love this game. It's probably the only coop that I enjoy. I've played quite a bit with my wife and it's pretty good two player, but 3+ is where it shines because there are all sorts of timing and bluffing clues you can give. This is a game that benefits from repeated plays with the same group. I highly recommend.

A blast! Such a change of pace.

Update: Starting to feel like we're all trying to fight our ways out of a straitjacket. It's also starting to feel a bit samey, and the only way we are making any progress is by making a sort of secret code. I'm worried that is bending the rules too much

I hate this game.  It is so easy to cheat and to have someone forget the information that someone told them.  You also have to have a system for communicating more information than you should, such as favoring the left most card that someone has when giving a clue.  I haven't had success without a system, but with it I feel like I'm just playing the game for everyone.  I always end up angry and no one has fun.  On the other hand, I think the game is very enjoyable on board game arena.

I didn't like it much when it was packaged with Ikebana, and I still don't like it. It is clever, and I can understand why some people really enjoy it.

While the rules and components are simple, this game is amazingly deep. It's also completely novel. I strongly recommend this game for everyone who doesn't mind a little memory challenge because the meat of the game is in innuendo and deduction.

Not really sure how this made SdJ. Its a good game, coop with some guessing, and its certainly family friendly, but there doesn't seem to be much meat to it.

Component gripe, cards are a little hard to show around in reverse (a tile rack would be great).

A good game, I can't deny. Unfortunately the concept of it rarely causes much eagerness or confident reactions in new players. As the plays have racked up, the game has generated more frustration and discomfort than fun from the groups I've introduced it to. Who knew people could take their memorizing abilities so personally.

Cooperative game, in which you see everyone's cards, except the ones, belonging to you. An interesting way to avoid alpha gamer. One of the most important aspect of the game is memory - to remember, about which cards and what information was given to whom. It looks like there are too little clue tokens, but apparently there are just enough of them to make discarding cards a necessity.

Kooperatinis žaidimas, kuriame matai visų žaidėjų kortas, išskyrus savo. Įdomus būdas išvengti viską valdančio žaidėjo. Vienas iš svarbiausių aspektų - atmintis ir nesusipainioti, apie kokias kortas, kam ir kas buvo pasakyta. Užuominų žetonų atrodo kiek mažoka, bet iš tiesų jų yra tiek, kad žaidėjai turėtų pakankamai preteksto išmetinėti korteles.

This game deserves a LOT of credit for being a "modern", designer game that can be accessed by many.  If I can play this with a group of old folks and show them something radically different from Phase10 or Uno - and they GET IT and think it's a fun and interesting game, and want to play it again - then this is possibly one of the most successful and important modern game designs.  It's a good family card game!

The only "flaw" of this game, if you want to call it that, is that the game seems prone to people insisting on cheating the game a bit with house rules to keep track of cards and put priority on certain cards, and it can suck the fun out with people who take it too seriously.

It's not my favorite game but it has a permanent place in my collection.

It's not much for table talk, but I like it so far.  It's one of my wife's new favorites, although she wishes she could get away with more inflection: "This one's green...
but THIS ONE'S ALSO GREEEEEEN!!" ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜) ))

1st multiplayer game we started to realize the power of telling person A things about their hand while ignoring Person A. Like Person A knows they have a 3. We might explain the next player down, Player B, that she has a green 4, skipping past A.  Player A knows that we all know that the only thing they know about their hand is one green card, and that there's a green 2 on the table, the person who goes next has a sort of go ahead to play a green 4, for which their are no easy spots, so should...they play their three? and hope it's green?  If we've all played out cards right, we've encouraged B in such a way that it makes A playing that green card a super, super good idea.  Let's do it!

This is a brilliant game. When I teach the game I don't tell people that you  don't see your hand so they become a bit confused then I drop the bomb and they are blown away.

I love this game and it will always be in my collection.

A strange cooperative game where you have a hand of cards that you cannot look at.  You see everyone else's cards and they see yours.

A good logic game. The best part is that no one can control the whole game (this is one of the major problems in many cooperative games). The "bad" part is that if one player doesn't give reasonable hits, you'll have very low mark. But you won't play this game with no-brainer, right? :-)

We purchased the deluxe tile version of this game.  I don't recall us ever disliking a game more than this one.  It has a very heavy memory element which we both despise so it's my own fault I guess for not having researched it better.  Someone had described it as a better cooperative Code 777, but I like that game, or really any game at all more than Hanabi.  Past the memory element the rest of the gameplay is just dull.  And it does feel a bit broken if no one should happen to draw a starting '1' tile/card which seemed too common in our two player games. I love deduction games but why not play one that is more thematic than just placing numbers? So many better cooperative games as well and yes if you want the figure out what u have game get Code 777 instead.  For two players get Fugitive. 

BEWARE THE DELUXE VERSION of this game.  It has a very very strong toxic smell to the tiles that made both of us nautious and didn't go away.  Didn't help our opinion as we couldn't be rid of that odor fast enough!

RECOMMENDED INSTEAD:  Code 777, Fugitive.

Hanabi is difficult to comment on. Like most cooperative games it is more of a puzzle than an actual game. But unlike those other cooperative games, which pit you against a set of rules designed to act as your opponent, Hanabi gives you a very simple goal and has you competing against your own memory, communication and observation skills. I've only played it twice, and found it to be really addictive (and I typically don't like cooperative games). As a quick game for experienced gamers or as a fun family game, I think Hanabi is a winner.

Perfection in a board games. Small package. Pure coop. No alpha gamers. Everyone has different pieces to solving the puzzle. Requires communication, but restricts explicit communication.

This is a lot of fun with more players. Played with 4, one of which isn't a big gamer and it went over very very well.

Replaced the R&R Games edition with a German import from AbacusSpiele. Traded R&R Games in MT.

This is a lovely, lovely game. A lot of back and forth with 2 but it works well. I can definitely see why it won.

That being said, the American card art sucks. The box sucks. Next time I import from Germany, I'm buying the German edition. If I could get the tin, I would do that too.

Surprisingly interesting concept. 

After initial confusion based on how players hold their cards (others see your cards, but you don't), complete game starts slowly to reveal (in all its glory)

Trying to guess what you have in hand, how it can help others and how you can help others by giving them information about cards they have are fantastically mixed in this highly deductive (and addictive) co-operative game.

Might be the only co-op type of game I'm happy to play -  cute, short, & simple, but it's difficult to win. Players somehow almost always ended up cheating a bit against the game - just couldn't help it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An innovative cooperative game where players must truly cooperate to win. 

Players have the simple task of playing cards of matching colors in the correct numerical order. The twist is that no player can look at their own cards, the cards that they are tasked with playing correctly. So they have to decide what to play and when to play it based on clues from the other players. The type of clues that can be given have certain restrictions and the quantity of clues available to the team is restricted so clues must be given and received very efficiently to get the maximum score. 

The game is fun and just the right challenge level to keep you coming back for more. The group gets a 'score' based on how many of the cards were successfully played which, combined with the quick play time and interesting/tough choices, makes for an addictive challenge that keeps you coming back for more.

Lots of potential for cheating.  The term that people use to describe this cheating is "convention" but lets not kid ourselves, it is cheating.

I think without cheating the game is fairly challenging.  With cheating, it becomes reasonably easy to win.  The choice of whether to cheat is of course up to the character of the group.

Clever dynamic where you have to deduce things about your cards from what others tell you. The clues seem abundant in the beginning, but quickly become scarce and you often want to throttle your partners for giving unnecessary clues or not doing the move they're "supposed" to do. You're often blind to your own role and instead focus on how you can help others. If you and your partners are good about not giving more information than allowed (really any extra information beyond the clues is too much information), this is a highly fun, deductive game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this game, you are dealt a hand of cards, but instead of not showing people your hand, you face your hand out so you dont know what you have. In the game you give each other clues to figure out what cards you are holding to build a fireworks display (basically going 1,2,3,4,5 in order of each color) 

Very fun and much tougher than you think.

Hanabi is a great cooperative experience. It's easy to explain and so far all people I played with quickly got the hang of it. Its short playtime is also a big plus, so usually several rounds can be played in succesion. I'm glad I bought this game and I'm sure I'll get a lot more plays out of it. So far I hven't gotten the perfect 25 point game, although I got close quite often. But then, there's still the multicolored fireworks for an extra challenge.

Love it. A coop game that doesn't degenerate into one player telling everyone what to do. It also requires that you model *why* a player would make a certain play based on the information you both know and the information they know that you don't in a way really helps with more complex competitive strategy games.
It's quite simple, so after lots of plays with the same group might get a little boring. I'm really hoping to find a game that builds on the "can't see your own hand" mechanic with a little more depth!

I would have never imagined that a game of such challenge and depth could be conceived using only coloured cards numbered 1 to 5. What it lacks in theme (I say this knowing full well that fireworks go off in my head every time a card is played successfully), it makes up by being the the tensest co-op on the market.

So much game comes in that unsuspecting little box.

A really addicting co-op that requires deduction based on the amount of clues given. Definitely more of a challenge as the number of players increase. Also, the game becomes really easy or really frustrating based on playing styles, i.e., when I play with players who I have taught how to play or who play with the same strategy with me, the game is incredibly easy, yet when players have developed their own strategy to play, it becomes more frustrating than normal play. Overall, I've begun to stop teaching other players certain strategies in attempt to allow them to discover those strategies on their own, which makes the game more rewarding/fun to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The only co-op game that I will ever play. It's impossible to be an alpha player and tell everyone what to do in this game, because of its interesting mechanic. Can lose its charm after you reached the maximum point though. Still, it's a keeper.

I like it, rating might go only up. The best co-op game I've played so far - just great. Works nicely with different kind of game groups. I don't like this "keep your cards in your hand" -system, but luckily you can avoid it with card holders (and I've bought couple of them). So yes, I really think that Hanabi deserves the SdJ -award although I've to admit that there will be plenty of people who don't ever going to like this game.
-> updated 9/2013: yep, rating goes up 7 -> 8. This is THAT good. There is a chance, that it goes even higher...

RATING: 6.5
Hanabi—named for the Japanese word for "fireworks"—is a cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the table in the right order. 

The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1–5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1–5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.

This is a neat little coop game that requires full teamwork. I love the fact that you don't see your hand of cards and you have to give each other hints as to what colour or what numbered cards others have. It's challenging in a sense that the complete set is hard to accomplish because there's only a set number of cards and not all cards come by at the right time.

I don't exactly find it too much fun, except for the fact that this game has a unique mechanism, it feels a bit lack luster other than the giggles and faces we made from illegally trying to hint when and what other should put what card in their hands.

Recommend if you have not play this.

Mainly 2p. Talk about emergent game play. We have developed a set of extra rules that guide us closer and closer to the elusive 25 - perfect game. There is a surprisingly tense moment when you are about to discard a card you can't see.

Hanabi is a neat little card game that requires a group that can communicate well together and a decent amount of luck in card draws to complete the game successfully. It really helps if you have a player who has played the game a few times to offer tips. But really there isn't enough to this game to even make it a gateway game that I would enjoy playing more than once a year. At times it can be extremely frustrating, and i don't play games to feel frustrated.

Good with the right group. Really depends on group dynamics for it to be fun. I personally like it, but it may not be for the rest of my group.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting cooperative deduction game with some resource management decisions as well. Rules are a little vague on what exactly constitutes a legitimate convention for play -- is it fair to play with the understanding that your partner will always discard their leftmost card for instance?

My wife's current favorite. A very tight, accessible little game that everyone seems to enjoy. I like it too, but as I get more experienced with the strategy its becoming harder not to want to tell the less experienced people how to play. 

The game really is different with each group you play it with, and there's a learning curve as you teach each new group. I guess I'm getting a little burned out on playing with new players almost every time, as the basics are only exciting the first few times you play it. Still, it's a great little game.

The only co-op game I actually like: firstly because it is short, secondly because it solves the "alpha player" problem by design - using the very clever idea of not allowing a player to see his own cards.

We play this almost every single week at game night, at least once.  Once we (married "we" ;) ) had the "perfect game" about a year ago, we settle for nothing less.  This game is such a gem.

RATING: 7.5
Great co-op party game. Just feels like it's good to play with a small amount of people when no-one really wants to play against each other and/or no-one can think of a game to play. Has the tension needed to make a board game draw you in and keep playing later, and while it won't carry a session it's good to know I could bring this out if we're struggling with anything, and get at least one game out of people to pass the time.

In general, I don't really care for hidden role games, and most deduction games leave me flat as well. But this game, oh man. I can see this as one of those games where you introduce it to a bunch of new people, they play it, and then immediately demand to play it again. It's a cooperative game where everyone can see your cards except you. There are five suits with a distribution of 1-1-1-2-2-3-3-4-4-5, and you as a group are trying to complete a run of 1-2-3-4-5 in each suit. But the information you can give each other is limited, and you have to make some brutal choices. We played twice and got 13 points the first time, 14 the second time (highest possible is 25). There's nothing to the game, but it's tough, tense, and a lot of fun. (I have an Artscow version, will buy a real one ASAP.)

I have a difficult time, conceptually, with cooperative games, but Hanabi is better than most.  It's pretty straightforward and simple to learn, but once learned, there's a lot of difficulty to it; I've only won once since I started playing.  It's small, portable, and perfect for two players, so it's a good vacation or bar game.

The design is pretty but it's not spectacular; but it doesn't have to be.  The ingenuity of the design and the gameplay is enough to carry this one.  It's got good replay value and the rules are easy to remember.  You might say it's...nice.

Hanabi as a cooperative game can be dry at times, but has a significant twist of not having information about your own cards. Players must work cooperatively to give hints about the contents of each others hands, but it's every player's responsibility to remember, deduce, and play the cards they have. An easy to learn and short logic game, there are few games like it and it's not hard to try it out on any given night.

While this game does rely a lot on the group-think of whoever you're playing with the "time" and hand management of this game is very well designed. The theme is pasted on except for the colors but it's a very simple, easy to teach game that still has a good deal of strategy with how you communicate information, which varies depending on what cards are available, have been played, or been discarded. And of course the co-op where your own hand is more hidden from you than other players is something you don't see often in games.

Probably one of the more unique coöp games I've ever seen.  Quarterbacking is done away with completely with a complete lack of knowledge about the cards you can play.  This isn't a strategy game at all, but instead a communication game (and to a lesser extent, a deduction game).  Light but not easy, it fills in a neat niche in the coöp genre.

So simple, so smart.  Amazing that no one came up with this idea before Hanabi.  A lot of fun, built-in drama.  Only reservations thus far: colors can be hard to tell apart; the game itself feels kind of samey.  I've played about 10 times thus far, and in some fashion, it feels like the same game every time.  Which isn't that big a problem... that "same game" is a fun one.

A great attempt at solving what I see as a big problem in the cooperative games: the problem that all the players play together, and you don't make your own decisions. Here in Hanabi, you do make your own decisions, which is great. 
But the game itself is quite abstract, and "cold".

RATING: N/A
Awesome cooperative card game.  As a group, you're creating fireworks solitaire-style in the center, five cards in order in each of 5 colors (or with a sixth wild color in the more challenging variants).  I think the reason I actually like this fully coop game versus every other one I don't is because everyone has /some/ information, but not all the same parts, and are limited in how and when you can share it.  You play with your hand facing away from you, the only cards you can see are everyone else's.

It's a great opener game, VERY challenging when played right, definitely a thinker, and it can get more challenging with the variants I haven't tried yet.

Certainly only good for a few plays with any one group, though, and then I found it get boring quick.  Also, sadly, seemed to just frustrate my mother and sister, so don't know if I just wasn't teaching it well, or if this type of logic game just doesn't work for some people.

Bought at CotC 2013 from a FLGS for a whole $9 well spent.  Traded on here for the Dominion Stash promo card.

I love this game. It is challenging and forces the players to try and think from their partners' points of view, all while remembering what was learned previously and using deduction to make informed decisions. The biggest problem for me with this game was a lack of people to play it with - if you're at very different skills levels it can be frustrating for everyone.

I was skeptical of this game at first, but it has turned out to be a lot of fun. Many have tried and failed to create a co-op that can't be controlled by one player, and this is the closest thing I've seen to a success on that front. Because you don't know what cards you have, you don't always know whether someone is making an optimal move or not. This also makes the game frustrating and tense (in a fun way) when players are forced to make guesses or assumptions without full information, and with possible disastrous consequences. It's the sort of game where, upon finishing, you immediately want to play again. That's high praise.

[Played 23 times]

A short cooperative filler with a strong memory element (as you should also try to memorize what the other player know about their own cards, in order to help them with the best info).

After multiple plays, I think the game cannot be won unless you both have silent agreements and a good dose of luck. 
I'll abstain from calling it "broken" (albeit I suspect it is), but I'm not going to play it any more.

Die Spieler müssen die Karten nach Farben und Zahlen geordnet ausspielen. Man sieht jedoch nur die Karten seiner Mitspieler, nicht die eigenen!
Wer an der Reihe ist, muss sich für eine von drei Aktionen entscheiden. Entweder man gibt einem anderen Spieler einen Hinweis oder wirft eine Karte ab oder spielt eine Karte aus. Nimmt man den Hinweis, gibt man einem anderen Spieler einen Farb- oder einen Zahlenhinweis und dreht ein Hinweisplättchen um. Wirft man eine Karte ab, so darf man ein benutztes Hinweisplättchen wieder auf die Vorderseite drehen. Wenn man die Karte ausspielt, kann man mit ihr das Feuerwerk in der Tischmitte weiter vorantreiben. Passt die Karte allerdings nicht, senden die Götter, erzürnt über dieses Missgeschick, einen Blitz.

RATING: 9
Rated for casual play. I dislike strict adherence to the communication rules. For example, allowing a player to ask for reminders is totally fine by me. I also dig it when a player makes a veiled assertion about a card as they play it, like "I know that this is a safe discard." This, too, is technically a rules violation.

I have taken part in a couple of bad Hanabi sessions. More than most games, it can be soured by a player who is not invested in it.

Played 7 times before I realized this just isn't for me.  For the first few games, it comes across as neat - mainly because you can't see your cards, but see everybody else's cards instead.  Relies too much on playing with the same group over and over and coming up with a standard way of giving clues across each game.  If it takes too long to come back to you, then you may forget information given to you.  Definitely has lost its luster.  Others still enjoy it so I'll bust it out from time to time as an example of how different games can be.

Surprisingly it was a hit with nearly everyone I played it with. While it does need a fair amount of concentration its a cooperative card game variant of Solitaire.

RATING: 9
This game is a lot of fun.  It is interesting to see how different people try to help the deduction process along, but not everyone's thinking lines up.  Benefits from repeated plays.

---
Okay, I have played this game more than 100 times now and I am strongly considering moving it up to a 9. This is not a decision I take lightly, so I will probably wait a bit longer to decide, but this game is very good.  The process of building up useful conventions is very interesting and it is fascinating to watch new players as they go through the learning process.  The biggest downside to this game is that it does not work as well with a mixture of experience levels unless the experienced players are very aware of the difference going into the game.  

There are also a few major traps and mistakes that new players tend to make and have to be trained away from through thinking, example, and discussion.  

Still, a really good game.

I bought this (2013 Spiel des Jahres) at Cancon in January 2014.  It has been a hit with my two youngest children.  I think it is the first genuine co-op game I have played (although others - like Republic of Rome - have co-op elements).  This is fun and challenging, but the co-op aspect means that it doesn't scratch the competitive itch that lurks just beneath the surface ...

A remarkable game for something so simple. Eminently replayable, excellent with two players and probably gets tough with more. Just the right amount of frustration and challenge mixed with excitement and victory. It really is perfectly designed -- there is no way to improve on this. Games are (can be) quick, though reverse AP can set in -- I don't know the nomenclature for the fear, stress, and worry over making a wrong or potentially fatal move. Very fun.

7.5 - Feb 2015 - 4 Plays:  It's a good game and it's fairly quick.  I'd like to try it with just 2 players to see how that goes.  I'm not sure about the longevity of the game, but it's short enough that I don't foresee myself getting rid of it.

8.5 - May 2015 - 15 Plays:  This game has really opened up after playing it a couple of times online.  When everyone is on the same page and paying attention, this game really does become quite good.  I've only tried 6th color once and haven't yet tried multicolor, but I'm looking forward to it.

9.0 - Nov 2015 - 32 Plays:  This game is at it's best with a group that can handle the 6th color.  The feeling of scoring 30 points is amazing.  Unfortunately, this game really suffers when played with people of mixed skill levels, especially if people don't understand just how much you have to pay attention.

On the fence about trading away.  However, the game barely takes up any shelf space.  If play this game with standard conventions regarding how you hold the cards and why you would normally choose certain cards, the game has more direction and strategy but there are sometimes no real decisions to be made (the choice is obvious).  If you do not play using conventions such as "if I haven't told you what that card is it's probably not important", the game becomes brutally difficult and bit random.

Holy shit, this game is amazing. A deck of cards, a handful of tokens, and a short set of rules produces a delicious level of tension and a game like none I've played before.

The hook -- you never see your own cards, holding them backwards -- was enough to pique my interest, but it's more than just a gimmick. The game builds up layers of communication, including communicating by not communicating, and combines them with memory, taking chances, assessing your fellow players, and a lot of thinking in a way that's wholly unique.

I can see how playing with the same group would produce a meta unique to your group. We developed some conventions for how to share information, and what not sharing it meant, just inside of one game. And I love that the game calls out that you can flex that aspect of it -- what would be called cheating in most games -- to suit your group.

This is a motherfucking gem.

Limited Edition. 


There is a lot of game in this small package. If I could describe this game by using 3 words, I would say: tight, tense and thrilling. Only 1 play so far (as a 2 player), but I know this one will hit the table frequently. 

3/31/13: This game hits its sweet spot at 4 players IMO. Just don't play with more than 5! Way too chaotic!

Update 8/3/14: I played this twice last night with my wife. It's still phenomenal! My wife was literally begging me to play a third game in a row. We upgraded to the deluxe version, which I highly recommend. In fact, because I like the upgraded components so much, I'm raising my rating from a 9 to a 9.5.

Update 9/27/14: Played this game last night with 3 new people (4 player game). It was probably not the ideal group for this game. Everyone playing was highly intelligent. However, we all saw the game though a different lens. Everyone wanted to "chain" clues as much as possible, but we quite often disagreed on how to get there. Still, the game was A LOT of fun. Hanabi is group dependent, to be sure. That said, not everyone has to see eye to eye. The more important factor is that everyone at the table is of a reasonably high intelligence level, understands the general concept of the game, and is willing to work together for the most part. A phenomenal game!

RATING: 7
A French game reprinted by a German company about a Japanese fireworks display -- translated into English.  What an interesting circuit.  The take-home point of this is that it's a game so good that it's *worth* going round-about to get it.

I ordered the game from GameSurplus.  I had never ordered from them before, but they were one of the few places which I could get this game from.  Along with my shipment, they made sure to print out the instructions for Hanabi for me; that little act really set them apart to me.  That they knew the game well enough to print and include them with the game was quite the pleasant surprise.

The game itself is fantastic too; it's so simple that you think "How could this *possibly* be hard?"  But it is; people forget what you've told them or don't realize why you've pointed out something about their hands.  Also, the limitation on hints is a brilliant mechanic.  Great game for a great price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
4 /5 - Very Good

The beauty of Hanabi is how, unlike mosty co-ops, it forces players to actually co-operate with an absolute minimum of rules. Fun, frustrating and challenging, it's a great family game. For hobbysists, not so much maybe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.98
The best gateway co-op going.

The Goal: To sort 5 different suites of cards into piles numbered 1-5 with no gaps or repeated numbers.

The Problem: You can't look at your cards. Ever.

Player's Turn: Play a card, discard a card, or use one of the limited clue tokens and give a clue to another player. Clues are either they have card(s) with a specific number, "These two cards are fours," or color, "These three cards are red." If a player makes an illegal play, the players earn one strike. Three strikes and the game ends with a score of zero. Players can earn clue tokens back by discarding or completing a stack.

But is it fun? The games that separate themselves are the games with dynamic moments. Like a player showing their initial hand and reviling 3 green 1s. The two other players laughing and the person holding the cards going, "What?" Two clues later and everybody is laughing.

The moment when there is a stack of green cards with a 2 on top. You and another player have a green 3. Both know they have a green or a 3 and see the other players green 3. The one player discards his and you suddenly know you have a green 3 and play it.

Knowing only one thing about a single card out of the hand you have and deciding it is worth playing since if it was worth discarding you would have hoped the other players would have clued you in. You play it successfully.

Asking a person what they know about their hand, finding out they are wrong about two of them, you only have one clue to give, if that, and you can't correct them. There's only two copies of fours. Was one of the cards they had wrong a four? Yes, yes it was.

The ultimate fun one, there's no clues to give so you have to play, and you literally know nothing about any of your cards. And yes, this will happen often. Good luck.

Possible con: people who give out overly obvious clues.

This game is great for families who do not game very much. It might be a little light for those looking to play heavy euro's, but it is a great filler. I would have given it a higher rating, but what I have found is that this game is extremely frustrating when you are experienced and the rest of the table is not. That being said, this game definitely has no room for alpha gaming which is definitely a pro.

Bought at Cardhaus Black Friday Sale.

At 2p, this game is fairly dull, as the available card pool is almost non-existent.  Discards are more forced and the game drags.  However, at 3p, things really become more interesting.

The deduction element here really shines through at higher player counts.

This edition has really poor quality cards. A game like this that requires you to hold the cards all the time really needs much better cards. I may have to sleeve them.

As to gameplay, I think that I agree with Tom Vasel that it's not a game, rather it's a pastime. An extremely enjoyable and entertaining one nevertheless. 

It's quite clear that one needs to play regularly with a group in order to develop a protocol. It's also absolutely essential to be consistent in your use of the protocol.

Is this a co-op game or is it an activity that you do with friends? I don't know and I don't think that it matters. What I do know is that it's a challenge, that it's a heap of fun and it always generates a deal of after game chat. I think that it might prove to be a Gateway game and a new group ice breaker.

I LOVE this game's idea...except for the fact that the game became broken when my ENTIRE gaming group became a bunch of "card counters" and developed a system of winks, twitches, subtle gestures, et cetera and we could play an entire game without even speaking.

A mash-up of Uno, Indian Poker and Memory. Quick game easy enough to introduce to non-gamers. The game is goal oriented and that improves (re)playability. You have to remember what hints you have been given throughout the game so don't play while drinking (or do and see how fast you make your friends indignant). "I told you that was A RED CARD!! ARRRGGGHHH!!!" Fun enough filler card game for some, I did not like it.

It is hard to shake the feeling that the game is trying to land you in couple's therapy the whole time... I like games where communication is key, but having it be the only means to the end seems a bit dodgy because failure is essentially one note with nothing to analyze aside from who assumed what and how that led to miscommunication.  Part of me thinks its brilliant on the curve of "simple and effective", but the other part sees the whole experience balancing on the edge between the fun I've had here at the house and, well, icky were I to play it with folks less inclined to be understanding at game's end should things go wrong.

Very original cooperative game. Because everyone only has partial information and people can only share information by use of paid hints, this game cleverly avoids the alpha gamer problem which is present in most cooperative games.

In turn, it is not easy to introduce new people to the game, as offering advice or pointing out strategies during a game automatically constitutes cheating. This can be solved by playing an introductory test game.

I approached this game with some trepidation. Not liking deduction games & my friends knowing preference for gaming violence.

Beautiful tiles.  I really like the extra luxury of this version and it actually is much easier for me to play.  I can place the tiles in more configurations that the cards.

Also, contrary to the murmurings about unstable tiles, I've found that someone would have to hip-check my table to knock down the tiles.  No problems playing them at all.

I enjoyed this game a lot. It is very simple and elegant with a wonderful premise in the mechanics. It reminds me of a coop version of a team-based trick taking game (bridge, euchre, 500, etc.). It makes for a lot of really funny dramatic tension and banter when everyone at the table knows what someone should do except for them. I can definitely see this game becoming boring if the players take it too seriously, meta-game, or try to skirt the rules. But then again, a lot of coop games are ultimately played on the honor system because there's no one at the table who is going to force you to play "the right way." Great travel game with a tiny box and small footprint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very clever and unique game, but has not been as much of a hit with me as others I game with.  I've played several games since everyone else seems to love it, and I can certainly appreciate the unique design.  The memorization element doesn't really excite me and figuring out the most efficient, clever sequence to give clues often feels a bit frustrating since you're hoping others follow your lead.  I'll enjoy playing this if it's requested, but don't see myself bringing this out too often within my own circles.

Update: After several plays this has grown on me a bit.  I still don't tend to bring it out much on my own, but there is some really fun strategy here when playing with a group of folks who know the game well.  The co-op puzzle of sharing good info at the right time is really enjoyable and fulfilling.

I saw someone refer to this as a game of "bandwidth", which to me rang true. The whole game is trying to stuff as much information as you can into your clues - which are restricted to either colour or numbers in terms of what you can say explicitly - but what they imply is something else entirely. Chaining clues, tacit understanding of what the order of the cards in hand means, trying not to cheat by winking heavily as you state your clue, or more likely - sighing as they misunderstand completely and ruin everything. I've found that the memory component can make this game a bit too much for some, and depending on the style of game you want to play (aka, focus on memory or the deduction aspect) you might want to allow people to remind others about clues. The grade of leniency towards intonation and emphasis you allow in your clues is also something that I suspect will vary for each group. Either way it's a fun and intriguing cooperative game, unlike anything else I'd tried before. It's very simple to teach and learn, and it enables a short but enjoyable time of silent communication.

A good game!

Game in a Nutshell: Cooperative deduction game of playing cards blindly from your hand based on clues from others.

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: Highly interactive with lots of tough decisions due to needing to relay info while also playing to the level of the person recieving the clue. Simple rules but with scaling difficulty from tough to impossible.

Cons: Very hard not to taint the play with unintentional expression clues. The game can feel same-y and can become routine if played repetatively with the same people to the point where you're just waiting for the game when the luck of the draw falls in your favor.

Other: The memory element can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's funny to watch someone fret over which card is the one they thought it was, but it can also be maddening when someone seems to forget due reasons outside your control. I've played with the rainbow cards used to scale the difficulty only a couple times. They added a nice twist, and do add difficulty, but I don't think they ramp up the game notably on the enjoyment scale.

Best Use: A good filler/opener/closer with a splash of brain-burn.

[b]after 7 plays[/b] I would rate this higher except it's very, very hard to get players to play by the actual rules. Some people say that you should let people play how they want to play, and I get it, but that also generally makes it a much easier and less interesting game for me. 

My opinion might change if I play it alot with my ladylove, who will play it as it should be played.

[b] after more than 100 plays[/b] My ladylove and I have now won against all the variations except the hardest one, which we're now working on. I like it much more played as a sort of legacy game with the same person, over and over, as you develop conventions. There's a really nice unfolding of collective understanding. Also someone gifted us the deluxe version, which makes a much bigger difference to the experience of play than I was predicting. Not having to hold cards and move them around in your hand makes every feel much more effortless. Rating is up to 8 now.

Assuming this game is played in the spirit of the rules, not giving extra information with your clue via codes, intonation, etc., I still feel 95% of succeeding at this game is the shuffle. This doesn't seem the type of game that someone will become really good at; after a few plays, the best way to proceed with giving clues should become pretty obvious. The right cards being drawn at the right time will help more than anything. I like co-op games. I'm not against playing this one and I have had fun doing so, but I am stumped why this game is so popular.

Bought at Origins 2014

I usually hate cooperative games, but I love Hanabi.

It's a cooperative game of logical deduction with a unique mechanic (seeing everyone else's cards but not your own), a fun theme (building fireworks for a spectacular show) and the option to make it easier or harder with the addition of an extra set of rainbow fireworks.

Challenging, plays reasonably quickly, and very enjoyable.

I don't see what is so great about the game.  Too many ways to circumvent the rules, and our first game we won easily.  I mean, the game works just fine but it is just not that interesting.  Do people play this multiple times, and why?

Summed up by a friend of mine, who on his first play said, "I hate this game!  ...but I love this game!"

It's simple, yet it's a brain burner.  It's a co-op that removes the key problem with co-ops. (In Hanabi, an overbearing player doesn't know what their team mate's best move is).

I'm sure this game would rub some people up the wrong way, but I think it's clever, challenging, and funny.  Which is a great combo.

Contra-intuititive game. You show your cards to all other players but don't look at it yourself. This is a very confusing game at first and really hard to explain. This will become even more complex when you devellop a set of house rules about when to play or not play a card.

But it needs some logical houserules to become better at it. It's a challenge but also a lot of fun.

One for the head, but not for the heart, at least not for mine. 
What puts me off most is that it is a cooperative game, but communication is strictly limited. Shouldn't games in general a coop games in particular be about communication? The strict rules on this create a somewhat negative feel, and if you ease them off, the idea of the game gets ruined. Because of this, I very much prefer 'The Game' over this one.

Pretty Immediate approval and excitement, even from the anti-gaming contingent (bit unkind). I personally wonder how long it will see play but in the abstract: this is a fantastic design and a [b]must own card game[/b].

First score 18 (-3 due to very mild cheating but only 1 life lost, due to the drink confusing me). 

Second game 19 (-2 due to an even milder bit of cheating, two lives lost due to a 50/50 and some misleading/misinterpreted advice). Was an even more enjoyable game. This really is a wonderful treat/trick to own.

Third Game 16 (-0.5 due to raise-eyebrowgate. Lost all three lives, twice due to unforced error; once due to one player having two yellow 2s)

Fourth game 19 (No cheating. Two lives down. Folks have ordered their own copy.)

A year later - took this game on holiday to the Highlands and it of course remained a source of magic, wonder and entertainment.

Another year later - wet holiday and played with much laughter with many :)

The coop game par excellence. No alpha gamers, no pointless downtime -- everything every single player does impacts everybody else and must be paid attention to.

I think it's a great game. I love the concept that you don't see your own cards and need to play cooperatively to figure out which card to play. And, bonus, it is very cheap for the amount of fun you get out of it!

Very clever game. I enjoy very few cooperative games, because either I feel I don't have any individuality or that the game tries to give it to me through forced machinations. In Hanabi, every player has a unique set of information and is critical to completion. I spend every turn wanting to push words into others' mouths but I cannot. It's a wonderful sort of tension that is quite enjoyable, collectively spinning plates and not wanting to be the first to dash them.

First 2 plays with wife, we scored 17 pts both times. It's a tough game. Hard to imagine that we'll attain perfection, i.e. 25 pts.

Played with 4 and 5 players. Best score 22...with far too much player communication.

It's a hilarious game...
Player 1 - 'What do you know about your cards?' 
Player 2 - holding up two yellow cards - 'These two are definitely green'
Entire group bursts into uncontrollable laughter...but it's nervous laughter. Sure, the situation is funny, but deep down we know we're in trouble.

And that's the beauty of Hanabi.

A light weight coop - the challenge depends on how much table talk you allow and it can be hard to get a group to align on that.  It also takes a few games for everyone to get on the same page about what sorts of hints to give.

Hanabi is a cooperative game, meaning that all players are working together towards the same goal. The twist is that players do not know their own cards, and other players have to give them hints so that the cards are played in the proper order.

I have played many tense games of Hanabi. I have never done particularly well, but it has always been an interesting experience.

The crew of Shut Up & Sit Down repeatedly say that their favourite games allow for interesting decision making. Hanabi, in my opinion, allows for loads of interesting decisions, which make it a game worth playing.

Nem értem ennyi év után sem a SdJ díjat... Jó-jó, egyszer-egyszer elmegy, pasziánsz-fíling, de sokat belemagyaráznak, amit nem kellene.

A téma meg marhára nem jön át (mekkora baromság már ez a tűzijáték tematika?).

Azoknak érdemes kipróbálni, akik nem sok egyedi mechanizmust láttak még, mert az mondjuk van benne:
 - kooperatív pasziánsz
 - senki sem látja a saját kártyáját, csak a többiekét

Aranyhalmemóriával viszont ne is vegyük elő, mert borzasztó dolog, ha valaki két perc múlva elfelejti, hogy milyen infót kapott két körrel korábban...

Three plays of this one so far, all in one lunchtime session so it really works well for my lunchtime gaming group.  This fast-play co-op game has a rather fun ‘gimmick’ n that you don’t see your cards but all the other players can. That is, you hold your hand with the back facing you. As the game progresses, other players may give you clues as to what you have in your hand and you use your judgement (or hope to luck) that you have the card you think you do and play it accordingly.

The object is to get each of the five colours played on the table in ascending order from one to five, if you misplay a card it counts as one of your three ‘strikes’ before the game ends, if you achieve the objective you score a ‘perfect’ 25 points.  After that, you’re probably ready to add the wild cards which add to the difficulty factor. So far this plays pretty well and it can be both frustrating and amusing to see how your fellow player decide on what card to play or discard based on the limited information they have. Well worth looking at and one I will consider for purchase if the novelty of the ‘gimmick’ mechanism doesn’t wear off with a bit more play.

RATING: 5
Lowered rating from a 7 to a 5. I enjoyed it at first, but it got really stale for me after a few plays. I initially liked the group challenge of trying to build up a big enough vocabulary of unspoken cues so that we might get that elusive perfect game. But my enthusiasm for doing so has worn off quickly, to the point where I no longer care, and I have no desire to play it again. 

It's still a very clever game, but I've just come to the conclusion that (for me, at least) it has almost replay value beyond 4 or 5 plays. Beyond that point, you're either still just hoping to get lucky and get a perfect game, or you're trying to improve (as a group) by building up that aforementioned vocabulary of unspoken cues, implicit understandings of what the correct moves are in various situations, etc. I can see how some people would enjoy that sort of thing, but for me it starts to feel very dry and procedural, like we might as well be sitting in a conference room somewhere designing a flowchart for some insanely boring company policy manual. Not exactly what I'd call "fun".

There is so much to this small card game - it is a surprisingly deep and difficult game.  I dragged my feet on buying it because I thought it would be simple or boring or odd to hold the cards backwards.  None of these things is true.  It is very easy to explain and very easy to start-up.  But after 2 - 3 turns around the table, things get very tricky and very tense - there's a real Russian Roulette feel to many of the choices.   Believe me, there is more than meets the eye in Hanabi.  At about $10, every gamer should own this.

+1 collaborative element is fun
+1 Novel hand-of-cards-facing-outwards mechanic 

-1 countdown to show and burning down fuse tokens should both create buildup and tension...but the way they're implemented doesn't really do that, as you can freely reverse and avoid them respectively 
-1 seems far too easy to systematically churn the entire deck - at which point max points is just a matter of luck.

An ok came for the novel mechanic, which yields a few giggles, but groups seem to figure out the winning strategy very quickly and then get bored with it shortly after.

Ez az egyetlen kooperatív játékom. Lehet, hogy kellene még több? Egyszerűen zseniális! Az alapötlet, a játékélmény, a szabályok egyszerűek, de jól játszani nagyon nehéz!!! Kell jó logika, megfelelő kommunikáció és kellő memória. Utóbbi elsősorban a nehezített verzióban (mi úgy játsszuk egyelőre, hogy megkérdezhetjük a másiktól, mit tud a kártyáiról).
Negatívum? Kártyajáték, tehát sikerességünk függ a lapok megjelenésének sorrendjétől, persze emiatt lesz sokszor-sokszor újrajátszható, és mindig kihívásokkal teli!! Meg hát a téma.. hát igen.. a téma?

Ezt is többen megvették már 'miattam'.

Interesting concept with little to no thematic correlation, and with such loose rules - it felt aimless. Can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be, but I dislike that ambiguity. Traded.

Hanabi ist ein kooperatives Kartenspiel, bei dem alle Spieler versuchen, ein besonders schönes Feuerwerk zu entzünden. Der Cloud bei Hanabi: Die Spieler sehen ihre eigenen Karten nicht (!!), man hält sein Blatt quasi verkehrt herum, so dass man die Karten aller anderen Spieler sehen kann - nur seine eigenen eben nicht. So versucht man nun den Spielern durch bestimme Hinweise Tipps zu geben, welche Zahl in welcher Farbe er (womöglich) auf der Hand hält und passend anlegen kann. Auch Hanabi ist mal wieder ein flottes Familienspiel für Zwischendurch.

Clever coop that has gone over well with everyone I've played it with. It's not as challenging (especially if you play with the same group) as I had originally hoped but it's still good fun and serves as a great filler. The only game I own that's actually better played with new people.

RATING: 9
This would be a 10/10 rating except for one thing: the truly terrible card design, with TWO pairs of suits barely distinguishable from each other (green/blue, white/yellow). And the "deluxe edition" instead of offering you better cards, inside.... offers tiles. Pretty tiles, but I want to play cards not dominoes FFS.

Anyway, other than that this is an awesome game if played with people who are logical and who play according to some basic conventions (around the order of discarding and adding cards to the hand). It's a painful game to play with people who ignore these considerations. But if everyone's on the same page, it's really beautiful to see people working together in intense concentration and near-silence, and when you induce a series of plays exactly as you'd planned them, it's incredibly satisfying. Can be kinda frustrating when you get a bad deck, though--e.g. with both 2s in a single suit near the bottom.

RATING: 7.5
A co-op card game in which the players are trying to earn the highest score possible by playing cards to a series of piles in the correct numerical order. 

The trick here is that each player cannot see their cards in hand as they are held facing other players instead. (Think Code 777).

On a given turn the players can play a card or give a clue as to the cards held by another player. A clue though can only focus on a given colour within a team mates hand or a given value. 

It' a good game that will likely appeal to non-conflict gamers and those that like working together. The only issue is that players need to be fairly disciplined in following the rules regarding valid clues otherwise the whole thing can devolve into a farce of sorts with body language and intonation giving away more than is really allowed.

I don't see the appeal.  Maybe the intricacies of giving your team mates clues is lost on me, but I just felt like it was all guessing.  So what if someone tells me there is 3 green cards in my hand, or that I have a 4... as this still does not help me at all.

Hanabi is a gem of a game - five suits of cards numbered from one to five representing a firework display. All you and your fellow players have to do is place the cards on the table in the correct order, one to five in each colour. Simple, right? Well, not really, because the catch is that everybody can see your cards except you, there is a limited number of clues, and a person can only tell you about a colour or a number in your hand, never both...and they must include all cards of that colour or number in their clue. It should be easy, but is so much trickier than it sounds. You can play this with children and they will get it straight away. Play it with adults, maybe after something grown up to drink, and watch people go to pieces and curse their lack of short-term memory. You'll learn to fear every discard, and to rejoice in your rare high scores, but will you ever hit the perfect score of 25? If you do manage it, there's a sixth suit of fireworks in the box to throw into the mix...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an interesting little game. The positives are the cooperative aspect, and the mechanics are unique. The cons would be the lacklustre ending to the game. The theme says that fireworks are going off but there is not really a great cathartic moment at the end to feel like anything was accomplished. As a puzzle that is worked on collectively, it is 10/10 but it is not quite a game.

RATING: 5
Hanabi is perhaps an excellent convention game (and I suspect its popularity mostly grew there). But with a group of regulars, especially who know each other well, implicit communication rules will quickly emerge and the game will be broken. On the opposite side, supposing you're white knights of rules abiding, shutting up for 20 minutes doesn't really bring joy to the table, which is on the contrary what such a light game should inspire.

RATING: 10
I love this Game. It was one of the very first games I bought, after I got into the hobby, and it remains one of my favorites to this day. 
Mechanically, it is a simple yet decently solid little puzzle of playing cards in the right order, and managing your hand of cards, with the twist of not being able to see what cards you have. Rather, you rely on the other players giving you clues - and herein lies the real meat of the game. Because in practice, this is a game about getting into your friends' mind(s), and figuring out exactly why they told you that these two cards were yellow at that exact moment? Or why noone has told you anything about your middle card in ages. Maybe it's an irrelevant card, that you can just discard? Or maybe they just haven't gotten around to it yet? 
THIS is what makes me love this game so much. Sitting down with a new constellation of players, explaining the premise, and working out how people communicate under Hanabi's constraints. Sitting down with my partner, and playing for hours on end, again and again, until we get a perfect score - talking at length between rounds of the frustrating and fascinating situations we've each had to deal with during the game. Or simply pulling out Hanabi with the group of Friends I originally experienced it with, and experience the familiar laughter, disbelief and mental gymnastics, as we each, with our own limited knowledge, try to help out each other, without screwing each other over in the process.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Probably the best cooperative game. You actually have different pieces of information so everyone needs to be involved in solving the puzzle as opposed to pandemic and other coop games.
You can up the difficulty with house rules if you play with a synced group. Or if you play with a less risk taking group the fun challenge is to get everyone to play their cards regardless of them already having enough information.

In this cooperative card game, one is attempting to construct the best fireworks possible. The deck has 5 suits, with cards numbered from 1 to 5. There are three 1's, two of 2/3/4 and one 5 in each suit. Your hand size depends on the number of players, but you cannot ever look at your hand. You hold your hand outwards so your team members can see it. During your turn, you have three choices: 1) give information to another player about their hand, restricted to color or number of the card(s), using a timepiece, 2) discard a card to renew a time piece, 3) play a card blindly.  The goal of the game is to construct the suits in order from 1 to 5, scoring points for those constructed in order. The game ends when you either blow a fuse (playing cards blindly that don't fit) twice, or the deck runs out. 

This is a very good design and I can see why it won the Spiel de Jahres in 2013. You can have fun devising conventions you think will work. You can have fun laughing at people's mistakes. It's also addictive since you want to achieve perfection. I'm looking forward to trying to get 25 pts!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love the situations this puts you in. Games which manage to force you to make tough choices between a small number of options are always good and this one has the lovely effect of getting everyone fully involved while you take your turn because they know which choice is the right one and which is wrong.

I did have one game which was a bit 'meh' but that was just because it was a group that was metagaming so much that they gave all the info away ("That's a white card" *wink* *meaningful look at the white pile waiting for someone to play a 3*, etc.) so it just became a procession of putting down the right cards. I like it when it's played straight but I suppose it's nice that there's that flexibility if your group does want to make it easier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.7
I don't love this one as of right now. I'ts possible it needs more playthroughs or I'm simply not understanding it but it seems to have unclear wonky rules in a context that needs them to be more concrete. None of the decision makes and strategy seemed terribly interesting and the game is largely abstract. The parameters about the types of clues that can be given and how are unclear and it incentives you to bend the rules when they are not explicit. This is probably not one I would want to play again unless everyone else was playing.

Good with the right group. 'Cheating' really wrecks this game though, so be on your guard! I must admit this is one of those games where I can't understand what everyone is so excited about. It's okay, but if you're playing by the rules the social interaction is minimal and everyone is very quiet; and if you don't play by the rules the game is no challenge.

Fun light cooperative game that requires some memory and deduction skills. Game is enhanced if the players work together well (had a bad experience in Canberra but a great one in Adelaide; group dependent).  

PROS
-Inspires working together and friendliness.
-Really like Brendan's conjecture of if you have not heard a clue for quite some time about a card, safe to say its not important and can be discarded. 

CONS
-Can easily ruin the game accidentally, eg looking at your cards or incorrect clue/ extra unintentional clue. 
-Card stands not included.
-Group dependent: will not have fun with everyone. 

LIKE TO SEE
-Card stands.
-Summary card. 
-Tile version being released? (tiles can stand up!)

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game mechanic, but I'm not crazy about memory games personally. (Probably because my memory is really bad so I would struggle with the colors and numbers, and there's only so many orientations to use too) I did try the online version that tracks things for you though and enjoyed that more. One thing I dislike is how people have conventions of how the cards in the game should go. I think I kinda dislike that as its sort of an informal agreement before a game to play a certain way. I know its necessary to really stand a chance, but its just a strange way to approach a game.

Anyway, I did enjoy the online one a bit more than the physical one, and I think I may also like the tile/deluxe version more. Still not my kind of game though.

Plays: 3 ish

After a long gap i think i do like this game with nice friends and its enjoyable to strive for 25 (and 30 one day?) unlike other co ops its a true co op where you need others and though it has luck it has a lot of deduction and mitigation. I wonder if this would strengthen my memory too

With the wrong group this can be one of the most frustrating games out there, leading to a strong desire to kill someone. With the right group this can be just OK; nothing really special especially since you don't really "win" or "loss" but score how well you did which is kind of anti-climatic. I suppose getting good enough to get a perfect would be a great challenge but the game isn't interesting enough to try to accomplish.

Excellent cooperative game where players can see everyone's cards except their own. The goal is to give each other clues about the cards so they can be played in order on several colored piles. Simple, fun, and quite addictive; requires some decent memory skills to play effectively.

Objectively, I can recognize this as a great design. Subjectively, it's not something that I enjoy playing. I am terrible at remembering clues, lousy at inductively deducing extra information from the clues others give me, and am generally a bad teammate in a game where players are desperately relying upon me. Maybe with others who are uncannily awful at this, I would enjoy it more, but this is not my idea of fun. Need to be talked into playing this.

Hanabi is just a new kind of coop game. Bare bones. Just make sure no one is in the mood for cheating, cause then the game just doesn't make sense.
The 'domino' edition looks good, the regular card edition IMHO just doesn't (far from it). Still, a game you need to own.

Quite nice simple and fast cooperative game.

I like it for its originality and for the way it solicits a different kind of cooperation between players. So I would have liked to give a higher rating, but, to be honest, I find the actual play a bit flat. There is no real tension, maybe because most of the time the team is just scoring an average score and so it is neither really a lost game nor a won one.

Currently one of my favorite games. Simple rules that yield deep gameplay. Successful mitigation of quarterbacking. It's co-op, which I like. Japanese theme is a plus. Finally, it includes a rather devious expansion in case I ever manage to play a perfect game and want an added challenge.

This is a perfect game to pull out with my family since they love card games. The more people the better with this one. Though I don't like how you win at different levels. Meaning you just try to beat your last score. 

I think it is much better played in the opposite way. Meaning you try for a score of 18. Anything less then that is considered a loss.

Any ways it's still a great game that both serious and casual gamers can enjoy.

This game has grown on me.  If you get the right group playing, it can be pretty fun to try to communicate with the imposed limitations.  You also have to accept that you probably won't get a perfect score, and you're really just trying to "do your best."  I'm sure there are plenty of strategies that go with this game, and that's another reason to keep playing.

A fresh take on hand management, deduction, and cooperative gameplay. Simple, but elegantly so. Hours of fun and tension in the tiniest of boxes.

I will not be 'upgrading' to the Deluxe Edition as I feel the holding of the cards is part of the game's novelty, challenge, and, ultimately, its appeal. The conversion of the cards to mahjong-style tiles removes all that. Everyone has played cards, not everyone has played mahjong/dominoes, so the familiarity fades in the Deluxe Edition.

For some reason that I cannot fathom, none of my friends enjoy this game.

Awesome co-op that completely eliminates the problem many co-ops have, which is one player playing the game for everyone!

In this game everyone has a hand of 4 cards, the rub is that you cannot look at your cards, only everyone else can!  You start the game by having 8 clue tokens and the game starts be people giving hints to others about their hands.  A hint counts as, these are all your 2's, or 3's, or 4's, or blues, or reds...you give either the #, or color, of all the cards that also share that attribute.  People can discard cards to gain more clue tokens, but watch it, there are only a certain number of cards that you need to complete the game with a decent score.

Lastly?, the goal of the game is to place down the 5 fireworks displays in consecutive order from 1-5.  Can you group handle it?

There is a co-op I enjoy after all. A game that tests the group's logic and memory skills. Simple but engaging.
-----
After a few plays I wonder if a group can get to the point where it plays perfectly or so close to perfectly that the game loses its [i]raison d'etre[/i]. I guess in that case, the rule is that every clue you give is also a shot.
-----
After 10+ plays, I found out that I've been playing it wrong this whole time... you are not supposed to get any clue tokens back for playing a card. This is embarrassing, not least considering the number of people I've taught this game to, but it has the wonderful side benefit of making the game an entirely new, even more wonderful experience.

Acho que o mais legal do Hanabi é sua característica anti-intuitiva de jogar cartas sem vê-las. O tema é legal: os jogadores são especialistas em fogos de artifício que devem se juntar para fazer o show mais harmônico possível. Ou seja, as cores devem vir num crescendo. O fogo errado na hora errada estraga tudo. Por isso, para saber o que jogar, você vai depender muito da dica dos outros, da sua capacidade de dedução e um bocado de memória. Mas a mecânica é simples, tornando muito palatável para jogar com parentes que não são jogadores habituais - e rir da confusão.

I understand why this game is well-respected, but I absolutely hate it. First, you have to remember a ton of information, which if you forget any of it, the game is ruined for everyone. Second, the game is absolutely unplayable with more or less skilled players who have learned the "tricks." It's hard to tell if the tricks are legal (For example, if I point with my third finger and say this is a 2, I actually mean it's a blue 2).

Co-operative limited-information game which has some unique features. I feel that it will quickly become more about conventions than actual clue-giving, which isn't so good for introducing to new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
The design is very smart, not because the hints you can offer, but because of what I call "metahints", the implicit information hideen in your hints (see an example [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/184429/item/4282675#item4282675]here[/url]).

It's very fun to devise a way to transmit as much information as possible with each hint, thanks to these "metahints". And this is the reason I think Hanabi's design is very clever. But the different situations you can find yourself in are limited, and once you know how to deal with them, Hanabi becomes automatic and it's not nearly as fun.

Hanabi is a great cooperative deduction game. Players have 4 cards in their hands and they all together need to play numbers of 1-5 in five colors in order to win (well you score points for lesser attempts but ultimately you aim for getting all 5's on table). Easy task except you don't know what cards you have but you know which cards others have. On your turn you either a) play a card b) discard a card c) give a hint to a player. When giving hint you must name all cards with same color/number in somebody's hand. Since there is only a limited number of hints available (discarding gives them back) it is painfully good deduction experience. 

The first version (Hanabi & Ikebana) had bad card design. In poor lighting blue and black were too similar and this caused some errors in play way too easily. This would be a non-issue IF cards would differ also in graphical design but no, they are all the same except for colors. Why can't they publish a decent edition of this game? In tin box edition they fixed graphical design by having symbols also but square cards aren't the best possible shape or quality and also it has cludgy lid that won't really hold the game in without rubber band. Update: Abacus edition finally looks to be great edition out of this game.

RATING: 9
An actually rather light and lively collaborative game, Hanabi masterfully avoids the most common danger in its genre (becoming a multiplayer solitaire) by a stroke as simple as depriving a player of any knowledge about his/her cards: to lay out five fireworks on the table following a simple pattern players have to know from the other people on the table what cards they have. Nevertheless, the amount of information available is limited, and players might have to either discard potentially useful cards to be able to receive new hints or bluff and risk a penalty (three penalties end the game).

The rules are an absolute delight to read: the idea behind the game is clever and very concise. The gameplay itself lives up to them but doesn't offer then any new surprise - Hanabi is essentially what it looks, a game about recovering information under a tight, adjustable deadline. With two players it is definitely easier to play, since there are less possible hints and therefore less good hints to choose from: revealing information about a card might already communicate that the card in question should be played out.

RATING: 6.5
Semplice cooperativo senza traditori o simili. Il fulcro del gioco di carte (esiste una versione in stile Domino) sta nel far giocare ai propri compagni, nel momento opportuno, le prorpie carte. La particolarità è che tutti, all'infuori di chi ha le carte in mano, vedranno il valore delle stesse. Il gioco è decisamente astratto, l'obiettivo sarebbe quello di generare il più bel fuoco d'artificio della storia ma l'ambientazione si sento proprio poco. Per le sue caratteristiche il gioco richiede da parte di tutti una buona partecipazione e, anche se potrebbe apparire semplice, coordinarsi non sarà mai facile; ad ogni modo esistono varianti e carte speciali per rendere il gioco sempre più complesso e articolato. Per essere un filler/introduttivo mi sembra un ottimo e originale gioco.

Very intersting new mechanic. Seemed weirdly too simple, straightforward and luck-dependent the first plays. 
But after a while we got into it, getting a little more strategic. 
Has the potential for people really getting tense because they feel they need to tell you something but can't, which can be funny to watch. :D
So overall a nice little coop, with the advantage that no player can "take over" as he has no clue about it's card.

Fist of all: I LOVED it. Ingenious deduction game. Perfect filler. BUT: I'm having doubts about its replayability.

[i]I played one game with Mat and Joel to close out a great day of gaming at the TotalCon summer sizzler event. We thought we were going to score a perfect round until we realized that the game is scored once the last card is drawn. I have to admit that even though I don't really like co-ops I really enjoyed my one play of this. I could see playing this a bunch of times in a row, getting really good at it and then giving it away to someone else so they can solve the puzzle.[/i]

Unique mechanic, Seems hard to grasp for people. Thought this would be a gateway game. But I guess cooperation and mutual victories are not highly prized things in American Culture? Also I find people are somewhat cheaty (mainly in table talk and non-verbal communication that goes against the spirit of the game) when playing it which i find very strange when its a cooperative victory anyways. 
I might be more in love with the concept of this game than the actual game. Or could just be the folks who play it with me harshing my mellow.

Divertido. O jogo é diferente, muito interessante. Minha preocupação é que perca interesse ao se encontrar a maneira ótima de jogar. Um caminho pra essa maneira ótima é o jogador sempre conseguir dar uma dica sobre carta que possa ser baixada de imediato, mesmo que a dica em si não seja totalmente completa. Exemplo: eu digo "esta carta é um 3", e cabe um 3 branco na mesa, então o jogador já sabe que deve ser um 3 branco.

RATING: 10
100+ plays. Now I've played this new edition, it all the same so it gets the same comment as the original. It's a tense co-op using just a pack of cards. As a team you're trying to build 1 pile of each colour from 1 up to 5 Solitaire style. There are extras of each number, except the 5s, so there's some give but not much. The tension comes because you can't see your own cards before you play them. You're reliant on other players spending turns informing you about details of your hand (ie these are 1's, or this is green). But you only get so many shots at this before people either have to play correctly to a pile (make 3 mistakes and it's game over) or discard a potentially needed card in order to replenish the supply of chips which allow the team to do a helper turn. The game elevates to you trying to provide / glean the maximum mount of information with the fewest possible hints. Which then builds the tension - when he said this was a 2, did he imply it was a playable 2 or a discardable 2. Given what else I see around the table, and what's on the 5 piles, I'm going to say it's ... playable. Arghhh!!! So you somehow need to build a series of conventions where the same hint means different things in different situations. The game is fun in a quiet, slow, stricken way and is aimed purely at fans of deduction games. I't gets replay if you enjoy the challenge of defining and then refining a set of protocols that consistently enable you a chance at a perfect score. The real downside is that there’s no room for the game chit-chat or shared emotion that are the usual drivers of co-operative games (this may be what makes it more appealing to non co-op lovers), as anything you do can be construed as providing clues above and beyond what you’re allowed to provide. It can be wrenching watching someone draw the wrong conclusion from hints given so far and reach for the wrong card; to keep a straight face and not groan out loud, or make a face, or cough or simply yell out "nooooooooooo". Regardless, or maybe because of, I'm looking forward to the evolving discovery process and seeing how nailable this is with more play with the same group of players.

Pros: Nice co-op with a balanced but tough way to score points.

Cons: Have to concentrate all the way through; easy to allow house agreements/systems make it easier. The only game I've ever played I felt dirty afterwards.

Cool 30 minute deduction co-op card game where players together build 5 runs of 5 without looking at their own cards. Need your brain with this one: Need to remember what info you know about your cards, and need to remember what info has been given to the other players. No Alpha player syndrome with this coop, it seems.

Good for 2 to 5 players. Rules include variants , which helps replayability, and adds complexity if players become really good..

Rumor has it that there's a Solo Play version out there involving a mirror and a blindfold, but I haven't tried it yet.

I, personally, am so bad at this game that, for me, "the only way to win is not to play."

RATING: 4
"About what I expected: A dry, mostly-silent session of solving a logic puzzle, using memory, card counting, clues-by-convention, and second-guessing. None of which I'm fond of. At least it's a co-op, which saves it from being terrible. Definitely shouldn't have won the SdJ."

What I like:
- Co-op. Portable. 

What I don't like:
- Not a fan of memory games
- Not a fan of limited-oommunication co-ops
- Not a fan of second-guessing ("I think he thinks I think...")
- Not a fan of card-counting
- Not a fan of "conventions" a la Bridge bidding systems
- Would be better at 20 minutes (the last game I played took 70)

This definitely shouldn't have won the SdJ. Kenner maybe, but not SdJ. I would put the weight around 2.2, substantially higher than BGG voters, due to the brain-burning depth.

A first go on this was fun although we played it wrong. One of the essential rules was wrongly remembered by myself and made the game way too easy. We did get a feeling of how it works though and we still had some fun. We will try it again soon and see how it works. It is a fun game to play and the idea that you are the only player unable to see your own cards is great!

RATING: 7
After playing this on-line I raise my rating from 4 to 7.

What I hate in coop games is that they work as a 1player game. No one takes full responsibility for sth. In Hanabi your moves matter. You can make great moves or mistakes. YOUR great moves and YOUR mistakes, without having someone telling you what to do. 

But the main problem with this board game is that you’ll have to be really concentrated, so you remember every clue given to you but also the clues given to your partners. If you make a joke and the players get detracted, everybody forgets everything and the game is ruined. Socializing is bad for this game. I thing that board games should promote socializing.

When playing on line, the clues stay permanently on your cards. That makes the game easier than it should, but at least it is fun, and there is still room for strategic moves.

When playing the real game I try to simulate the Arena feeling, by raising clued cards higher, ranking cards from older to newer and if needed remind players of clues (as if the clues were there permanently for everyone to see). Helps a lot!

P.S. 2 Players? Not for me. The first time I played was with 2 players and I didn't want to touch it again in my life. Thank God for board game Arena, for giving life to this game. If I was the publisher, I would exclude 2-p at all costs. So be warned

(Wife's Point of View: She likes memory games but as it is unplayable with 2-p, we don't get to play it a lot)

The perfect co-op game? For such a simple game, there is a surprisingly large amount to learn. When you begin, you begin trying to learn how to interpret clues. As you get better, you will start to introduce a number of 'unspoken' rules that will help you score better, but also make clue giving quite a bit challenging. Different numbers of players really affect the experience. 

As a FYI, this is a "serious" game believe it or not... it's not light at all. If you play with people who have frequent lapses in concentration you will actually get frustrated unlike other, 'less serious', co-op games. Play with a good group and this is fantastic experience like no other board game - definitely invest in the majong style tiles if you find a good crowd to play with. Really, really, really worth it.

A very original co-op game. You hold cards in your hand, but you do not get to see them. The other players, who see them, can give you hints as to what they are and the goal is to get the cards down in order and by color. Your hints are limited and you can only make three mistakes. Getting all five sets in order is crazy. Be careful that your hint is not misinterpreted.

This is a fantastic filler card game as long as you don’t take it too seriously. It would be very easy to interpret the rules in a way that you all have to play in relative silence with straight faces that would never give the active player any clues but I have found that the game can cause hilarious outcomes when the players are trying to help each other, without giving too much away; giving the active player clues about the best thing to tell one of the other players is great fun and if they don’t understand your clues it can lead to an amazing amount of fun for a very simple and quick playing game.

One of the better co-ops IMO. Take that with a grain of salt, though, as I do not particularly care for co-ops. At least it nearly eliminates the alpha player syndrome found in many co-ops. I imagine replay value won't be that high if you play with the same group a lot.

I am not the biggest fan of cooperative games, but this one is an exception. I think it's because of the whole clue giving aspect, meaning that one person can't just lead the game. More importantly, I love that it's not "we all win or we all lose" as their is a simply gradient of point scoring. I understand that you could implement that in other coop games, but meh... It feels that the developers just want everyone to lose, and I am not a fan of that.

This is a cooperative information game, where you're trying to give other players clues as to what plays they should make during their turn, but are restricted in what you can tell them.  The gimmick of this game is that you hold your hand of cards backwards, so that everyone else knows what you have, but you don't.  This is not really my kind of game anyway, but my real complaint is that, once people start playing with the same group multiple times, they inevitably develop ways of communicating information that skirts the restrictions of the rules (such as syllable emphasis or non-verbal clues).

(5+ plays)

Attempted to get this out with my kids, who had zero interest in it. Not sure where I am going with this one, will probably end of selling it or giving away.

4-17 ended up played this close to 100 times as of this writing, with my 70-year old mom, and we had a blast! Probably will play this only a few more times however, we may have burned this out.

We would play Love Letter, Sushi Go! in between plays of Hanabi.

Bottom line: great game with the right crowd.

Cooperative game, where all players have a number of cards that have to be played in the right order, to get points. The catch: you can't see your cards. Players have to give (limited) hints on numbers & colors and deduce their cards from these hints. The fun of the game is to start developing communication patterns with your group so that you can deduce the correct cards with the fewest hints.

Unusual co-operative game where you can see everyone else's cards but not your own. In your turn, you can either play a card, discard a card or reveal a specific piece of info about the cards in another player's hands (either indicating which cards are a particular number or which are a particular colour). As with some versions of bridge, 'conventions' about  where you place cards you plan to play and those you plan to discard draw a very thin line between strategy and cheating.

Hanabi is my kind of cooperative game and my partner likes it quite a bit.  The rules and the stucture of the game play are very simple and easy to teach.  However, the game itself requires quite a bit of deductive and tactical thinking. I think it play fairly well with two, although better with more players (with two the turns can end up being somewhat uneven - one player gives clues, the other plays cards). This game ends up getting played quite a bit because it plays quickly, takes up little table space, and we always have a desire to beat our previous high score.  

Update: Wow, the wild cards make this challenging!

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per play

This is truly an unique co-op game that has an Indian poker feel to it. I did pretty poorly the first game, scoring 3 points before we blew the fuse. The second my girlfriend and I did pretty well, scoring 21 points. This is truly a game that tests your composure under stress and see if you can retain your memory of the cards that were in your hands. 

I thought I won't make a mistake playing a 2-player game with girlfriend but boy was I wrong about that. This game requires concentration, and under stress we tend to forget things! There is enough meat there to make this game an 8, where I would want to challenge myself and play with others. 

This is a solid game that scales up to 5 players. It comes with an extra suit to spice things up and up the difficulty a level. This game is well worth the price tag like Love Letter.

I love this game.  I've played it with 4 different groups now.  Most of the "language" development is the same between groups, although each group does have their own accent (and it's tough to remember the differences from group to group).  When I play with my parents, we've started adding the extra cards...haven't won with them yet, but we will eventually, I'm sure.

RATING: 8
Fun with familiar players, bad with bad players.

What annoys me about Hanabi is that the deck can make it impossible to achieve a perfect score. For example if the last three cards in the deck are red 1s, then the maximum possible score is 23, since plyaing a card force you to draw a card and the deck ends with the deck. There could be two possible solutions for this:
- The game doesn't when the deck ends, but when players run out of cards to play (or three misses).
- The deck could be quasi-randomly stacked in a way, which rules out impossible deck combinations.

RATING: 7
I've revisited this elegant design online and contrary to being a co-op it can engender a less than positive experience, obviously dependent on who you are playing with.

The main source of the negativity is the potential feeling of letting the team down, advice perceived as finger pointing etc. for it is easy to make a mistake: the simple clue giving often implies subtle hinting difficult to tune into until either experienced or intuit quickly and there is the issue of being able to recall what clues were given (card moving can assist here). 

(Surprisingly, visiting online play has revealed pre-game discussion of conventions of play and what certain clues mean, such as if not given clues for a while discard from right conveyor belt style, number clues means keep etc. I find this tactical advice (just short of saying what the card is) not only removes some of the tense uncertainty of card type and the deduction work, it is also counter productive because all the ritual rules makes for confusion and possibly prone to mistakes. It is far better to let the players learn what is productive clue giving and resource management). 

Also the design tightens up tableau placement as the game progresses (there is only one 5 in each colour) making correct plays even more important, so again a potential trigger of strong psychological and emotional repercussions. Sure it can make for stomach churning moments, but I wonder if co-ops with dice are the way to go to temper the feeling of letting down the team, as no-one can point the finger at a bad roll.

THIS is the Antoine Bauza card game that should be garnering the most attention (not that other one... bleh). Crisp, clean design. A deduction game in which the rules for clue giving actually work. I generally do not like cooperative games at all, but this is a cooperative game that I will actually request to play. Ideal length that is a perfect complement for its challenge level (ie, it doesn't overstay its welcome).

Next time someone in the group suggests 7 Wonders (bleh, bleh) I will counter with this gem.

RATING: 10
I don't generally like co-operative games because they tend to feel like team solitaire and have the problem of one player taking over. But Hanabi is a marvel. It avoids the alpha player problem by strictly limiting the amount of information players can exchange; indeed that's the whole point of the game. Each player holds their hand of cards backwards, so that everyone except them can see them, and the team attempts to play all five suits out on to the table in ascending order. It's deliciously counterintuitive (at first players keep ruining the game by accidentally looking at their cards!) and admits some advanced tactics once players start trusting each other.

My wife and I REALLY enjoy this as a two player game. It takes practice with the same group of players to get good (assuming you don't allow cheating with your voice inflections). The only problem is that my wife and I are good enough with each other now (we only play with the rainbow cards anymore) that it can be frustrating to play with other people.

In Hanabi, you're trying to play five different color fireworks in consecutive order, but you cannot see your own hand, so you must spend clues to identify to other players what cards/tiles that share a color or number, and they then aim to play legal plays. Your goal is to score all five suits with all five numbers. You can technically lose, but winning is not so much the goal, but winning with a high score.

The game is pure co-op with basic logic puzzle stuff, and it's sorta interesting... but I find it... sorta boring. I'm not playing a game at an 80's arcade, I'm not really motivated by high scores. I appreciate what the game is, but there's something, maybe its deceptive simplicity, that makes if not stand out for me.

A cooperative deduction game. Have a 5 card suits - numbered 1-5 and are trying to play in order. The twist is that the player cannot see his own cards but only the ones the others have. You have to supply clues to the others of what to play or discard, you have a limited number of clues you can give before you must discard a card to get the ability to issue a clue back. 

Ok for what it is, but didn't get me too excited.

Hanabi is one of my favorite games of all time. Extremely simple rules that lead to fairly deep deduction and a good amount of strategy.

Can be frustrating to play with new players, however, when they give terrible clues.  It can also be difficult to keep your mouth shut and avoid giving away more information than is fair.

Trick for people with bad memories: use the orientation of the cards in your hand to keep track of the information you have about each card.

The mechanic is brilliant, but the actual play is only so so. Theme is loosely tacked on and like most cooperative games it becomes a bit "solved" after only a few plays to where the decision making switches over from having to actual think about things to just making the motions. 

UPDATE (June2017): After continuing to play this more and more and developing conventions I like it more. The game evolves from being a bit of an autopilot to being a bit more deep when you're able to give clever clues within the convention structure you've set up with skilled players. I personally find this by far the most fun way to play the game and would give the game quite a lower rating if you play it the way many "purists" would want you to (with memory elements and stating no agreements may be set up, even commons sense ones). But if you set up a few common sense agreements like always drawing cards into one side of your hand and discarding from the other you're able to set up more clever plays that has made this game stand out a bit more for me.

It's that one clever mechanic that makes this whole game stand out and be more entertaining that other variants of patience. However, I found the 'rules' of giving tips and helping your fellow players just too vague to prevent players from cheating (unwillingly) and therefore breaking the game. What if you accidentally say something that is a tip or cannot help but making a face before someone throws off a card etc. Good for families and non-gamers and therefore, a good choice for the SdJ, but I am afraid hardcore gamers will solve this way too quickly.

February 15, 2014: I really don't like co-operative games.

==============================


Only play with non-gamers; they tend to get more into the spirit of the game (which are the rules), that is, only giving out information that you're only allowed to give out.

This game is a bit low on the deduction and high on the tactics and guessing. That is one of the primary sources of tension, and why it's much more fun to play this with non-gamers.

UPDATE August 2012: Gave this to my aunt; I'm not sure whether or not to add it back into my collection.

I was surprised about Hanabi. We saw it at Essen, but we thought, "a card game? meh".. Hanabi is more that that. It is a game about coordination, knowing your partner, controlling yourself, and so on. If you play it well, it is a nice and refreshing game.

I can appreciate this game. I just don't really want to play it if there are other games around. I like a little more theme. There is nothing wrong with this game, and I do respect it's design, but it just is not my style of game. I would play it again, as a filler if someone suggested it, but I would not buy it.

Antoine Bauza is one of my favorites, but what makes this particularly special is that it requires a deep connection with those you play. You learn one another in a way that makes the game that much better. Hanabi creates a cooperative experience that takes the game out of cards, off the table and into your head and between people. Pure brilliance.

It's hard to explain my love for Hanabi. The concept is very simple but you might burn your brain a little finding the perfect strategy. Players have to be very clever about the clues they give. It's really easy to make a mistake or cheat on accident unless everyone can play completely straight-faced. Overall- it may seem like a simple memory game, but there's a lot of fun in this tiny box.

RATING: 9
Simple, yet brilliant brain burner. This is my game of choice for filling time between other games. Loved by almost everyone I've introduced it to. Gets a lot of laughs because you basically have to unlearn all of your basic instincts about card games. Making mistakes is all part of the fun.

RATING: 5
I usually dislike cooperatives because I don't like other people telling me what to do on my turn. Hanabi mostly avoids this trap, which is good. It also has the benefit of scored wins, rather than a simple win/lose boolean result. Rules are very simple, play is quick. It's a little awkward to have to hold my cards all the time so that other people can see them.

RATING: 7.75
Cleverly inverted co-op card game. The theme is a little thin (if a game with these mechanisms is going to have a pasted-on theme, I think it a better one would have been codebreaking or bank robbers trying to break into a safe). It's fun, fast, and easy to take with you. It's hard not to give away extra hints to other players through facial expressions, but overall I like this fresh take on a cooperative game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hanabi is a very inexpensive cooperative card game that everyone seems to enjoy a lot.  The whole "show everyone your hand but don't look at it yourself" mechanic seems to pique folks curiosity about the game, and once they play it most really like it.

The game plays quickly and the cards are well made.  I think it's a great game for families; I do believe think it would be tough to play with children younger than 8 or so however as a bit of wrong info can royally hose your game.

Good game, good price, unique and light theme, nice vibrant colors on the cards (yet still colorblind friendly), quick playtime - perfect filler.

I know there is a tile version of the game which is probably nice, but personally the card version is my preference since its a fraction of the cost.

Made our own deck.  Had a great time playing a 5P game.  We laughed and bonded over this game.....even though we had no idea what we were doing!  :)

Have played a few times as a 2P game which is also a fun way to play.

Recommended game, but you need the right group/mind-set.

At first we used no conventions....absolutely zero.  Now we play with one convention:  We only give clues about cards that can be played.  At first I thought this would be 'cheating' the game, but we've found it equally or even more rewarding than trying to play with no conventions at all.

The game worked fine with no (and I mean zero) rules/conventions, but now that we've added one convention, it still works well and gives us a better chance to do well....I've found it more rewarding with that one convention.

This is good co-op. There is no chance anyone can quarterback a game. It's also difficult, making the replayability high. It's deceptively simple. People don't always "get it" at first, but once they do, it's great.

Description: Cooperative, mind boggling, deduction card game with limited communication options where players are collecting sets of fireworks in 5 different colors.
Weight: Medium to light.
Players: 2 to 5.

Impression: A genius game by Antoine Bauza. After a period of adaptation to the mechanics in which you can't and must not see your cards but only those of other players there is a period of learning how to optimize your clues and strategy. The game is very hard to win, but extremely rewording and it is best when is played with the same people so you can easily enter their mind. After a while you will be able to understand each other without even talking. I love playing this game with my sister. It's a kind of ritual. There is also a hard mode with rainbow colored fireworks but we aren't even close to trying that. Great game all together.

Likes: Whole deduction mechanic in which you see other player's cards and they see yours and you must find the best way to communicate without spending too much clue tokens (and there are 9 of them). Feeling of mutual understanding when you manage to score >20 points.

Dislikes: Because of limited communication rules the tends to be somewhat antisocial, and people often become very frustrated due to misunderstanding or forgetting previous information. It can even shake up the relationship.

This game is a rub.  It could be fun with the PERFECT group.  Everyone in the group would have to be very smart and have a very good memory.  Very.

This is a game that I quickly found myself getting very annoyed with the players who weren't doing well.  I HATE games that make me not like the other players.  Maybe that's a personal flaw of mine.  My way of avoiding that kind of animosity: don't play these types of games.

What a great surprise! This little card game is huge in fun. Although, this is a French game designed by famed 7 Wonders designer, Antoine Bauza, Hanabi is the Japanese word for "fireworks". 
My wife and I played this game first before introducing it to our gaming group family. My wife was skeptical at first about it simply because I told her it was a game about fireworks called Hanabi, which made her nose curl. After a slight confusion during the quick explanation of the rules, a few rounds into the game her skepticism turn to excitement. 
To both our surprise, the game seem very intense. The challenge of trying to acquire the best possible score of 25 will have you wanting to play again and again. 
Having played Hanabi several times since I have found it works as well as a two player game as it does a five player game. I highly recommend this unique card game to everyone.

this is a unique co-op type game in that it can't be played solo.  That is actually refreshing as my wife and I played this with no one taking a lead as it is impossible.  However, it does suffer for those who have bad memory recall as memory is very important.  Basically you get clues from you opponent about what is in your hand  however, you may not look at your own hand.  I would categorize this a more of a party type game or a social game.  It would be interesting to see how this plays out with more players.

edit.
Ok game with five players but it can be a quite easy actually. Counting points after an easy win isn't that interesting. I assume the 4-player game is the most interesting.

There is a lot room for cheating with the way imply the tips. You also may say something that can reveal essential information to other players.  

edit.
The 3-player game relies too much on memory and essentially becomes a memory game. The mistakes are only made if you have to guess or forget something.

May 2014: Played this a good bit over the fall and winter.  Using John S's deluxe set with tiles instead of cards.  Terrific game that really makes you feel like you're working as a team to make something happen (or keep it from happening).  Highly suggest it, although some friends really haven't liked it at all.

May 2015: Sounds like too many people are getting deluxe sets with poor quality tiles (flaking, off-center marks, etc.).  Too bad.  Otherwise, I'd be tempted to get a copy.

Hanabi is the first pure co-operative to genuinely solve the problem of one player being able to direct all of the activity. By building player communication directly into the game it creates a fun experience - though one that requires players to be in sync to some degree.

This wasn't a game either my wife or I was considering to buy - I don't even like co-ops, and while she does, she mainly plays them with a friend of hers. Anyway, this friend recently bought this game for her as a birthday present - and I'm really glad she did, because I have much enjoyed our plays so far. It feels a bit Knizia-like in how the ridiculously simple rules (really you don't need to buy this game, you can play it with an ordinary deck of cards - with a few modifications - and any kind of tokens) lead to a completely unique game with some very interesting strategy. While I generally dislike co-ops, this one is unique, to my knowledge, in having the players all have access to different (but overlapping, at least with 3+ players) information, with the main point of the game being to devise an efficient method of communicating this information to each other. This allows the game to be nothing like the usual co-operative game where the players all play as effectively just one player against the game, something which to my knowledge has only previously been avoided by either playing in real time or by having a "traitor" mechanic, neither of which tend to be types of game which I enjoy.

I am a keen bridge player, and Hanabi actually reminds me quite a lot of that game, in the sense that much of the game is about communication, using just the means prescribed by the rules. In the case of Hanabi, it seems to be left to the group's discretion exactly what level of discussion is allowed - presumably the "correct" way is to play in silence except when giving information, but even then some "groupthink" will creep in. (Even in the first play, and definitely subsequently, we were discarding our oldest non-known-about cards, and informing each other which cards these were, which allowed us to prioritise which information to give first.) There are a huge amount of inferences to be made in this game - about why your fellow players chose to give the information they did, and when they did. It really helps to know how the other players think - which makes it a great game for regular play and discussion with a group you know well. And the game seems to be insanely hard (we have won just 1 of I think 5 or 6 3p games, even though we were probably exchanging more information than we should by conversation - and in our one 5p game we got nowhere near). No doubt the appeal will fade in time (I wrote these comments in November 2015, it's now the end of January 2016 and I'm not desperate to play again soon, although I still really like the game), but I've found this game really fascinating in a way which I didn't expect. It is well deserving of all the awards and buzz it's got.

I'll need to play this one some more to see how much I like it. We will need to learn each others tells to know the added meaning behind hints. You are limited on clues and cards, so efficiency is key. My problem is that the difficulty level might sway from being hard to eventually being too easy as we get better. I wonder if removing clue tokens can make it harder without hurting the game or making it too hard for that next step. Really, I think I'd prefer Beyond Baker street if I had the choice though. Advantage Hanabi for portability.

I find this game more strain than fun. It's a deduction game where I must remember the hints I get from my cooperative fellow players. There is some challenge to reach higher scores as a team, but I don't enjoy the game. Maybe people who like memorizing thinks, or who just don't care so much about the hints given will like the game. But for me, while playing this game, I want to write down notes.

Hanabi places a deductive spin on set-collection and has earned a reputation to be a mainstay among co-operative games. I can see why. There is not much new or profound things to be said about this game, and it has very little in the way of substantial faults--except perhaps that it is largely player-driven. This is a blessing and a curse. You will have those serious groups, making a strong attempt to memorize their cards and give rules-kosher, tactical, hints; just as much as you will have those less-serious groups rollicking with laughter at the ridiculously-obvious hints that are apparently not obvious enough. 

In either case, if the players aren't mentally invested in the "tone" of each game, it will play out to be rather lackluster. Still, Hanabi is an ingenious game which can serve to show non-gamers a glimpse into the possibilities of creative design in hobby tabletop games, and well-deserving of the SDJ.

(+) Original mechanisms
(+) Player-driven with high interaction and potential for fun/rewarding meta-gaming
(+) High-replayability value for the challenge of beating your previous score

(-) Can be frustrating with a poor group
(-) Co-op nature can lead to one poor player tanking the experience for everyone
(-) Metagaming can (unintentionally) make the game too easy, resulting in hollow-earned victories.

The hidden information and limited communication mechanics are novel and fun. My wife likes it a lot more than I do, but I'm usually willing to play. Generally I prefer my co-ops to be players versus the board (puzzle solving), but Hanabi sees to be something else. It's still fun, especially when you do not cheat.

Brillant idea to hold your cards so the other players can see them. It's fun for a while and it's a good game. What I don't like is that nobody wins, and you even don't win or lose as a group. You just score a number of points as a group. Therefore, the fun is beating your own score, but I don't like to play a lot of games of Hanabi in a row.

This game is spectacular.  Opened the brand new box and read the rules with three non-gamers.  There were looks of "this sounds too simple to be any fun". However, once we started we were all hooked. We ignored the concert in the park we were watching to play a game. Then, after the concert we played another round.  Then, the couple we played with asked to come over to play again the next day.  We are already planning our next go at it.

There must be some magic formula that has been stumbled upon here, because this game is pure enjoyment and stupendously memorable.

RATING: 6
I'm not into coops, so not sure how to rate this as I'm not really in the target audience. Based on a 3-player game, I enjoyed it more than I expected to, perhaps partly because it's short and simple/elegant. The communicating only through formal information ("this and this are green" etc) reminds of communication with a Bridge partner, something which I find theoretically interesting but sort of off-putting in practice. I felt like I got to "play with"/experience that kind of formal narrow communication in Hanabi for a much lower time/effort price than if I were to get into Bridge.

I've since played and enjoyed it several more times. Not something I'd actively seek out, but it does seem more interesting than traditional coops (which could usually just be a solitaire game with a single player running everything - or an alpha player running the team) due to the limited communication channel. So that is cool.

Truly unique little gem, Antoine Bauza's Magnum Opus. I would say this game is about establishing communication between players with very restricted means, one also might view it more as collective puzzle solving or finding thin balance in your actions. It feels like this game should get samey and boring eventually, but as I keep playing and playing, on the contraty, it gets only better. I am discovering layer after layer of strategy, subtle nuances begin to flourish with meaning. It is like "Inception" movie among board games.

RATING: 7
Awesome mechanic of your hand visible only to other players - more games should use this mechanic. It's all about your group getting better at giving clues (or not giving clues) that carry lots of information. But that said, there needs to be more game - for a co-op, I just want more competition against the game.  It's pretty fun, but I can see it getting old fast. I also don't enjoy a game where you are constantly thinking/saying "you can't say that" or "oops, I just gave a tell."

RATING: N/A
My dad had difficulty discerning the color of the cards, especially the blue and green. He is not color blind, but the blue background of the card made it difficult to clearly identify the color. If the border of the card was also colored, it might be easier to identify them when giving a clue to the other player. 

I can see people enjoying this game, but my family and I have poor memory, making this game frustrating to play. You could use markers to keep track of clues, but at that point you might as well play with the cards face up.

RATING: 3.5
I've played this game several times now. I gues it's an ok game. Nice to play at a bar. But something about it just makes my skin crawl while playing it. Probably because it's another of those games where it's all about memory. There's a theme with a lot of the games I rate poorly. They want you to remember things. Like the game Memory. I'm not just awful at that game, I'm really awful. I can only remember like the last two cards I looked at. 

With Hanabi at least I can arrange the cards in my hand so that I know which ones I should know the value of. And I can also use my other hand under the table wit the number I'm supposed to remember. This game is really just group solitaire, which is fine, but why does it have to stress me out with the whole memory thing?

RATING: N/A
--Jan2015-- I've observed several games now of Hanabi.  And have asked to sit out on each occasion.  I find the questions the game asks don't resonate with me - nor do I enjoy the activities the game requests of its players.  I neither find it "play" nor "entertainment."  YMMV, naturally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This can be a very tense and strategic game, however I have found that it is impossible for people to play by the spirit of the rules.

It is too easy, and too inviting, to try and give 'extra' information when playing the game "THIS is a two, and this is also a two". Or people say after a game "Well, if you noticed, I was always pointing first at the card I wanted you to play." It seems people are eager to come up with their own secret codes for how to defeat the game. This is a coop game, the only person you are cheating against is yourself.

Beyond just the obvious example above, I have noticed that you can gain so much extra information just by watching the expressions on other player's faces when you go to grab a card. You reach for the one of two cards that might apply and you can just see people starting to cringe, or look away from you.  Or conversely, you reach for one of two cards that might apply and someone sighs in  relief.

I recently played with an adult player who hates to lose games, and she was TERRIBLE about this. She kept trying to give everyone extra information either through extremely blatant facial expressions or by emphasizing how she was pointing at cards.

Some might say that is just part of the game, but at what point does it cross from 'part of the game' into giving extra information that defeats the core purpose of the game?

So... I could still be convinced to play this game, but I am never going to suggest we  play it during a game night.

If you are looking for a solid lightweight card game, look no further than Hanabi, a cooperative game in which you and your friends build firework shows with the rules of limited communication.

Very easy to teach co-op which disallows any sort of alpha gamer. Winning the game (getting to 25 points) is very difficult. The game seems to become easier as a group develops their own unspoken language, which isn't super appealing to me, but can enjoyable with a consistent group.

There were some aspects of this that were really fun, but it is a game that leads to recriminations afterwards - "Why did you tell me that/not play that" etc...   Also, the fact that you don't win or lose really, but get a score for how well you did, somehow didn't work for me - even though you can say that 16 or more is a win really.

RATING: 7
Egy vékonyka pakli kártyából sikerült elég sokat kihoznia Bauza mesternek azzal, hogy nemes egyszerűséggel megfordította a lapokat a játékosok kezében. Sokan igazán nagyra értékelik ezt a trükkös kis kooperatív játékot, de nekem összességében valami hiányzik belőle. Rendben van, hogy igazán jó logikára van szükség ahhoz, hogy minél több pontot érjünk el, de kissé frusztráló lehet, hogyha későn érkeznek a sorkezdő egyesek...
Talán a későbbiekben, több játékot követően, majd változik még a véleményem, de elsőre nem fogtam padlót tőle.
Külön említést érdemel a kártyák kiváló minősége!

Néhány játékot lejátszva lényegesen nem látom jobbnak. Viszont az biztos, hogy iszonyú nehéz és gondolkodtató (persze, nyilvánvalóan ez volt a cél, hiszen ezért kerül elő többször is :) )

RATING: 7
+ Cooperative, but necessitates independent decision-making. 
+ Makes you think about what information is most important, and how to communicate it efficiently. It's interesting to think about it as an abstract model of conversation. 
+ Fun practice for working memory.
+ A big part of the enjoyment happens outside the gameplay, when you brainstorm strategies with the other players. 

- Themeless. 
- Doesn't always create an urge to play back-to-back games of it.

Hanabi is one of those games that's deceptively easy to teach to others, but so very hard to master. It can be so extremely frustrating trying to determine what to do on a turn - burn a clue?

And, even more, it's easy to transport and take out to play.

For a quick card game with no chrome and a stupidly simple ruleset, there is so much room for deep thought in this one that it makes me giddy. With a good, clever group, it allows for wonderfully complex interactions and information dissemination. 

The downside is that I find it *very* frustrating with people who either aren't paying attention or aren't good at determining which clue needs to be given next. As long as I can get in some occasional plays with my "Dream Team", however, it shouldn't come to bloodshed.

Ez a játék egy kommunikáción alapuló kooperatív játék ahol egy isteneknek és a népnek tetsző tűzijátékot kell létrehozni. 

A mechanika egyszerű. A pakli 5 színben lévő 1-5-ig tartó számsorból áll. Ezeket a lapokat kell kijátszani 1-től sorrendben. 

Az igazi nehézséget az adja, hogy a kezünkben lévő 4 vagy 5 lapot mindenki látja csak mi nem. Így a többi játékos segítségével kell meghatározni melyik lapot is akarjuk lerakni és javítani a tűzijátékunk minőségét. 
A tippeléssel vigyázni kell, mert 3 három hiba után az istenek esővel mossák el a parádénkat és egy árva füttyöt sem kapunk a mutatványért. 

A 25 lapból 20-at letudunk rakni akkor nagy tapsra számíthatunk.  

Az alapjátékban van nehezítési lehetőség egy 6 szín bevezetésével.

I don't mind the idea of the game, but memory being a key element feels dated to me.  I feel like I can't socialize as much during the game as a result.

Good cooperative deduction game. I'm not sure how much fun this would be as a social game without a bit of chat throughout the game - nothing to divulge anything too important, but a bit of "I can see a really good move, but I can't tell you what it is," really injects some fun into the proceedings.

There are choices aplenty and for a cooperative game it feels like you've got control of your own actions. After all, you always know something each of the players doesn't. Sometimes some risks are taken with discards, and you always hope your hints (revealing information) are interpreted correctly. It all adds a bit of tension and excitement. Rules are easy and it fills 45 minutes pleasantly.

This game is that to me.  It makes me angry when someone says "why did you do that, it's illogical" or "that clue made no sense"...this is the only game I've ever quit in the middle.

I hate it. It is a 2 on my personal scale.  The design gets a 9, and if coops are your sort of thing (apparently they aren't mine) you'll love it.

But I hate it.  Actively.  Sorry ratings police.

Only in my collection because my family likes it.

A very innovative use of cards create a fun and challenging cooperative game. This game has a few faults, first the cards can be dealt in a way that you can't achieve a perfect score, and the players must be careful not to unintentionally break the rules by talking about the game during the game. Despite this I love this game and am very impressed by it's design.

Interesting, unique game that is quite frustrating - sometimes, you simply don't have enough information to make a meaningful decision - but despite that the game somehow remains fascinating.

I like this game. In theory. Of course like many Antoine Bauza cooperative games, it can be a bit challenging (that's the fun part, right???). I think this game requires more than 2 players to really shine, and I'm looking forward to playing it with more in the near future so that I get a better feel for the game.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent cooperative deduction game about putting on the perfect fireworks show. There are five suits, and in each suit there are three 1 cards, two each of 2-4, and one 5. Players try to cooperatively play cards in order. That is, you can't play a blue 2 before the blue 1 is played. The trick? YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR OWN HAND. That's right, you see everyone else's hand, just not your own.

Players have three options on their turn: play a card, discard, or give a clue. You start the game with 8 clue tokens which are required to give a clue, and you can get back spent clues by discarding. A clue is telling one player information about a specific number or suit. For example, "These two cards -- these are red." Or "you have one 5 and it's this one here on the end." There are also three error tokens, which you get if you play a card out of order. Three errors ends the game early. You can also lose by running out of time - when the deck goes empty, players get one more round and then the game ends.

Technically there is a score chart you go by, adding up all the points from successfully played cards, 25 being the best score, but most of the time we play to win a perfect game. So once a perfect game is impossible, we'll usually restart. But you play how you like. It takes genuine effort not to "cheat a little" in this game. For example, you're just dying to talk about why the card Leon just played was a bad call but to do so might clue Leon into his hand. Also, I find it fun to establish playing conventions sort of like Bridge. Depending on who you talk to, this can also be cheating. (I call it handicapping.) I play (and announce to all before the start) that I'll be adding new cards to my right and discarding cards from my left. So anyone can look what is my leftmost card and know that if I shouldn't discard it they'd better give me information soon.

Clue giving is an art, and half the fun of the game is analyzing after-the-fact what clues could improve. We play that clues should generally be "actionable." That is, if I tell you "this is a three" I'm telling you that it's a playable three, and is of the same suit as one of the played twos already out there. If I tell you these two are red, and the red 2 is out, it's telling you at least of of them is an important red 3 or higher. On your turn, you're allowed to ask other players "what do you know about your hand?" and if playing with new players it's not a bad house rule to correct them if they misremember information you know they were given. 

It's a simple game to learn and hard to master. I love games like this although I'm mediocre at them. Bring on the fireworks!

Wow, this was a surprise, both for the sheer quality of the game and the sheer ridiculousness of it making the SdJ final list, let alone the nominees list!  
One of the best co-op games I have ever played, and one of the cleverest puzzle executions too.  The only reason this doesn't get a 9 is that the concentration risks outweighing the "fun" (I have difficulty in classing this merely as a "light" or even a "light-medium" game even though it is so simple...)

very interesting, unique co op game that deserves admiration. You and other players are trying to play sets of cards in the right order but you are not allowed to look at your own hand, so one must give your team mates clues about the cards in their hand in order to win. deduction and a little mind reading goes a long way.

Hanabi is all-around an extremely clever game. It's a challenging puzzle with wonderfully elegant mechanics, and it has the potential to be really, really hilarious. You'll find yourself completely livid with another player for misinterpreting your clue, but you won't be able to express your anger until the game is over!

Every facet of this game is a strength. Cooperative games frequently have the problem of one player acting as a leader and bossing the other players around, but the limited communication in Hanabi makes that problem impossible to encounter.

Played 9/28. Alicia and I got 19 points first play. I think she did better than I did. I missed some info by not paying enough attention to the "graveyard". White killed us as both 3s got discarded. Really enjoyed this one. Can't wait to see what happens with 4 or 5 players. Lovely and tactiley pleasing tiles. Stinky game box!

RATING: 6
Cooperative game. Objective is to play 1-2-3-4-5 in order in 5 suits (there are 3 1s, 1 5 and 2 of all other #s in each suit). You see everybody else's hand of 4-5 cards but not your own, and there are strict communication rules, so this game is immune to bossypants syndrome, and more like Space Alert, Wok Star etc.

3 options on your turn:

1. Play a card (and draw 1), If it's not a legal play, get a strike. 3 strikes and everybody loses.

2. Give information. Discard a clue token (start with 8) to point out to somebody all the cards he has of a particular suit or number.

3. Discard a card and gain a clue token. But look out if you discard the last copy of a card, preventing a suit from completion!

As the giver, you have to identify the riskiest player and guide him. Who you don't pick can also be telling. I think giving somebody a 1-card clue should also only be reserved for emergencies.

As the receiver, you have to figure out if the giver is telling you to play, keep or discard that card, and if what he specifically said about those cards says anything about the other cards in your hand.

Lots of other second-level and third-level info like in other deduction games.

A lot easier with a regular group, but I think the fun is to figure out the conventions in-game with experienced strangers, then apply them.

The Zendo concept applied beautifully to cooperative play. Shades of Tichu (teams), Pow Wow (don't see what you have) and interesting deductive reasoning are all in here.

- After a while you just keep following the same strategy over and over, hoping to have the proper setup of cards to raise high score
- You never feel like you are winning or losing. The game ends and you think, ok we did everything perfect, that's it. Or you think, ok we have done a couple mistakes maybe we could have scored a little bit higher. -.-

RATING: 4.5
In one month going from 6.5 to 8 rating. 

It's deduction game meets co-op. But it's also a double think game and a game of trust, instead of "I think that you think that I know that you ..." it's more like "it's not what I tell you but why I tell you" and "if nobody told you anything else, that's all you need to know" (unless we just didn't have the time. Oops.). 

I need some more plays, but somehow it seems that 4 and more player might be more chaotic. Playing with 3 seemed best so far (you get a bigger hand). Will try some more. 

Played German edition, the original artwork was a couple of levels more beautiful. Will probably make my own copy (as Germany is far away and nobody is importing this). 

Why I like it: It's my replacement for Mastermind, but it's a group activity with psychology included. Good stuff.

Played 1 4P game. Hanabi's a unique take on a co-operative filler game. Not knowing what is in one's own hand, but knowing what is all the other players' hands is unnerving as you're trying to deduce what is in your hand via verbal cues. A lot of trust has to be established in this game, in hopes that your partners are giving you clues for a good reason. There is a strong memory aspect to this game, so it's probably not a good idea to play this when players are tired or looking for something light to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Initial impressions: This game is a lot of fun, and it's the first cooperative game I've seen that uses this particular mechanic. It was a bit of a challenge to remember to not look at the cards when you draw them from the deck. It was also challenging to *not* find ways to give wildly more information than you were supposed to give.

I'm a bit disappointed that the symbols for the different colours were changed for the most recent version of the game. While the kanji used are beautiful, they are also really hard to describe, which means that the game is less playable if you have colour-blind players in your group.

2014: 8. Excellent, light-ish co-op game, fantastic for non-gamers!  Was a huge hit on my choir tour, people wanted to play again and again.  It was fun to make fireworks sounds whenever we got something right. :)

UPDATE: I take back my "non-gamer" comment.  I think you need a certain amount of "gamer" in you in order to understand the unconventional mechanics. I had a terrible experience trying to explain to my Dad that it's a co-op game and that you can't look at your cards.  There may be hope: my Dad *did* eventually understand that you can't change the order of your cards in Bohnanza, so maybe one day he'll get this one too.

Hanabi totally blew my mind when I first played. I love cooperative games. I love games with a memory aspect. I absolutely relish uniqueness. Hanabi felt fresh and innovative. Unforunately, it doesn't hold up particularly well over time. You begin to develop certain methods when playing with the same people to where it begins to feel samey. When playing with new players, it's easy to become frustrated when they play in a way that you now know to be suboptimal. However, it's still a real joy to get to that point! And even still, I enjoy the occasional game. When I consider the fun and experiences I have had playing this $10 game over 80 times in person and many other times I couldn't track online, it deserves a lot of praise and accolades. I cannot stress enough that this is a game everyone should give a try!

A super puzzley and interesting cooperative game, that we really enjoy at all player counts (though I thought it was most fun at 5). It’s nice to have a small box co-op game, since most of our others are a bit more involved for setting up and rules explanations. It creates a great level of frustration with your teammates, and an even better sense of accomplishment when you do something right. The games play quick as well, so even when you screw something up you don’t feel like you have wasted everyone’s time.

A DriveThruReview-t készítő Joel Eddy játékai között bóklásztam, mikor megtaláltam a Hanabit, ami tőle 10-es osztályzatot kapott. Rögtön utána néztem mi is ez a kis játék. Nagy szerencsémre az 5 színből és 50 lapból álló játék játszható a Fiasko játék lapjaival így rögtön ki is tudtam próbálni. Hihetetlen ötlet a lapokat fordítva tartatni a játékosokkal és ezzel egy okos kooperatív játékot sikerült megalkotni. Megmondhatjuk egy színből vagy számból melyik lapok konkrétan melyikek egy játékos kezében egy token felhasználásával, amit szerezni egy lap eldobásával tudunk. Harmadik akcióként pedig a játék célját valósíthatjuk meg, tűzijátékot építhetünk, de ehhez helyes lapot kell leraknunk. Tehát tulajdonképpen egy kis memóriára és jó megérzésre van szükség a játékhoz. De ahogy Joel is mondta jól játszani nem könnyű és gondolkodásra készteti a játszókat. Nagyon ötletes, nagyon egyszerű jó kis játék a Hanabi, ami akár otthon is elkészíthető. Nem véletlen Joel jó osztályzata. A pontszám akár még emelkedhet is.

[2017-02-26]
Rengeteg parti van benne, mert játékosszámtól függően más a játék, a szivárvány lapok is más dimenziókat adnak a társashoz. Ettől függetlenül nem emelek a ponton.

A fantastic cooperative game with a simple win condition but deep strategic elements involving being able to correctly read your teammates' intentions. One of the few cooperative games that is designed in such a way that it cannot devolve into Solitaire when one player knows what they're doing.

Seemed interesting at first but quickly outgrew that first impression. Often frustrating as you try to remember your own cards while watching others do things you try to prevent. Once your group has played a couple times and you have codes for what means what, it really stops being interesting all together.

Hanabi is quite a unique cooperative game where you don't get to see the cards in your hand, only the cards the everyone else is holding. Using vague number and color hints, you attempt to deduce what cards you should play and what you can throw away. I really enjoy this game and I've always had a good time playing. I think the game scales well too. With 2 players, you have more control over the clues you give, and with 4 players, you have a wider range of cards to look at. I've never managed to get a perfect store, but each time we play, I always want to keep trying with the hopes of getting all 25 cards into their stacks. One day...

Terrible game. It is extremely hard not to unintentionally cheat. You have to focus on remembering everything that has been said during the game which makes it frustrating to play. It is a coop that makes players annoyed at each other. They want you to keep score on how well you're doing but include no score sheet or anything with the game. It is also very random. One of the worst games I've ever played.

Interesting memory/co-op game where you cannot look at your own cards, and instead rely on other to give you clues as to what you have. You then have to place cards you think will complete the firework sets in the correct order.
Easy to manipulate and bend the rules, so depends on the players involved. Quite taxing to keep track of what you do and don't know, depending on the number of players involved and time taken over turns etc.

Brilliant little co-op that is a cross between Code 777 and Indian poker, in that you can see everyone else's cards but your own and are working as a team in order to get the cards down in order.

UPDATE: A group favorite (and one of mine). I'd love to get a copy of the deluxe edition with the tiles - they're very much worth it. I think what I like best is that everyone has to really do their own thing, so you really are working together as a team, and the weakest link really does pull you down. Also, the quest for a perfect score remains elusive, but it's nice to have a concrete number of how well you did to track your plays and see if you can't get more tiles the next time you play. The short playtime also is a nice bonus - it makes it a fun and worthwhile filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An unique and interesting game.  A co-op game that geniusly avoids "the overbearing leader" problem.  

The trick to playing well is to get people to understand more than just the basic thing you just said and at the same time, understanding what is in your own hand based on what others have said.  Deduction at its best.

There are genuine moments of stress and tension as you try to make decisions using only limited information - never has laying down a single card been so anxiety inducing!

edit - finally got a perfect 25!!!! that will probably never happen again :)

have not been logging my plays of this but it is probably in the 70's by now.  i love it.

Addictive co-operative game. Players must assist each other in ordering 5 (or 6 with a variant) sets of coloured cards in ascending order from 1-5. The catch is that clues can only involve how many of a particular coloured card a player has or how many of a particular numbered card they have. Lots of fun.

Hanabi is sophisticated team-solitaire, but in a good way. Due to asymmetric information, it's as much of a team effort as Tichu, except everyone is working together. As you play, you learn that what isn't said is as important as what is. Repeat play has only improved my view of the game, and that's always a good sign.

Update: Hanabi has gotten tons of play time over the holiday with friends and such. It's a really accessible game to casual gamers but has some strategy and depth to it. One of the better pure co-op games we've played.

Had one or two rounds of this at a local meet-up. Was underwhelmed to say the least. Each player has a hand of cards that they hold so that only the other players can see. Players give each other clues about what they have in order to get everyone to successfully lay down their cards in the right order. (I think that's how it works) There's some experience required to know how to give clues. Apart from that, it's just not my kind of game.

Pros
- Unique idea for a cooperative game
- Great strategic depth
- Replayability is high due to high difficulty and variability of how cards come out
- Mechanics make up for the lack of theme

Cons
- Card quality could be better

I really, really enjoy playing this game with any combination of 2-5 people. Everyone I have played this with has enjoyed it, as well. Great design and highly addictive. I only rate it as low as a 7 because there are more fully featured games out there that make this feel like more of a "filler" game instead of a "game night experience."

More plays:

Clever, but it's still a coop ... not for me! I'd rate it a 3 or 4, but it is still a good design so I'll only drop this to 5. 

----
First plays:
A very clever cooperative deduction game. Fun to play, if you like to think and have a group that can think along with you. You need to have some conventions, like putting your oldest cards on one end of your hand, or rotating cards you know about, in order to play well; of have a phenomenal memory, I suppose! You also have to be able to figure out why someone is telling you something at the moment they are telling you, or why no one has said anything at all. Is it because it's OK to discard everything, or to play everything? Think deep!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are 4 suits, each with 3 1s, 2 2s, 2 3s, 2 4s, and 1 5. Players each have a hand of 4 cards, facing away from themselves (like Code 777, you can see everyone else's hands but not your own). There are also several clue chips nearby, as well as 3 strike markers.

On your turn, either:
- discard a card: flip a used clue marker face up and draw a replacement card for your hand
- play a card: only legal plays are the next-highest number for each of the colors (so start with 1, then play 2, etc.); place the card in its column on the table, then draw a replacement card for your hand
- give a clue: flip a clue chip face down and tell a player about their cards. May either point out all the cards of a single color, or all cards of a single number.
If you make an error, either by discarding the last of a card that you need for a sequence or by playing a card that is not the next in a sequence, you get a strike; 3 strikes and everyone loses the game.

The game ends if you complete all sequences, get 3 strikes or draw the final card (in which case all players, including the one who drew that last card, get one final turn). Score VP based on how many cards you were able to play correctly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A nice relaxing yet surprisingly stressful game. The limited options of giving clues to other people and trying to come up with the right ones... requires a bit of training and strategy.

Got really surprised by how much fun this game was for what a small game with really simple rules. Great strategic short relaxing co-op. Like it so far.

Especially surprised everyone in our gaming group liked it. We usually play heavier games, but we love co-ops and this one is just so unique and enjoyable, I think this is a keeper.

Edit: After a lot more plays this weekend, we sort of figured out some strategies of giving clues, but it's still a challenging game. Raising the rating to 9.5, it's a very often played game due to it's short play time and whole lot of strategy going on. We usually play more silently, so we don't let out aditional clues, we just want to beat the game. But still, we're able to laugh during the play. Although sometimes the laugh is a desperate one. Like when a person is given clues so that he knows 4 out of 5 cards in his hand exactly and when you ask about his hand, he says he knows nothing. But the game is still a great fun and I see it being played for a long time.

Wonder how it will be when we figure out the base game and add the rainbow expansion. It's something to really look forward to when you enjoy it already as a base game.

When I first heard about this game I was very interested in it as a quick filler/strategic party game.  After playing it though I gotta say it underwhelmed me.  The ideas are pretty clever and it's not a bad game by any means but all-in-all it's just not super fun to me.

I will say that I'm interested in a truly honest game to see if that changes my opinion any, I think it will slightly.  Every game I've played so far has involved a good amount of cheating.  Whether it's players putting a lot of inflection or emphasis on certain words when they give clues or saying aloud what they've deduced is in their hands (thereby essentially telling other players what is in their hands).  Yet I have noticed the nuance in the strategy of the game that can exist when not playing the game so loosely and it does intrigue me.

Although I also feel once you've mastered that nuance it will probably get boring and it's not a deep enough game to garner any more out of it.

I'm coming around to this little game.  I still have yet to play a truly honest game, it may not even be possible.  But for a quick filler there is a decent amount of fun and right amount of thinky-ness where you can play with literally anybody.

Fantastic concept, very different from most co-ops I have tried so far. I am a bit torn, right now I love it yet there is this feeling that once one has a good strategy about this the fascination might wear off but who knows, my rating will keep track of that. There are different scenarios though, so maybe the replay-ability is higher than I fear right now.

I really enjoy this game. It is frustrating but there is a bit of a meta game. For example, you don't always read about the cards you know, sometimes you read the person to get an idea what to play. I know it's a bit against the rules, but it really adds more depth. Also, as you play it with the same opponents, you set up little conventions, such as the order in which you discard or how you arrange your cards. It seems like it would be accessible for everyone, but I've played it with a few people who just didn't get it. I'd give it a 10 for the weight if that was the case.

RATING: 8
Astonishingly good cooperative deduction game where players aim to, as a group, lay down sets of 1-5 in 5 colours. The trick is that cards are held facing outwards, and information able to be shared is limited to either "these cards are [colour]" or "these cards are [number]". It's an amazingly elegant, timeless design -- and it's great fun.

My rating would be higher if not for two problems: it's surprisingly hard to play without inadvertently cheating unless table-talk is absolutely suppressed (it's so easy to give away information with gasps of relief etc.), but if you're all sitting quiet and blank-faced then that's not a terribly social atmosphere. I also don't enjoy memory games and Hanabi does have a strong memory element unless you allow notes or reminders. It is quite good enough as a pure deduction game so I think it is better if the rules are bent to keep it that way.

RATING: 7.1
Watch your friends point at a card in their hand, gleaming with confidence, calling it a yellow 3 when it's actually a white 4. Hilarity ensues. It's pretty easy to avoid "losing" entirely though so ultimately, the stakes don't feel as high as they could be.

Unique co-op that is easy to teach non-gamers. Not sure about lifespan, becomes a bit sameish after 4 or so plays. The tension of playing a firework card is sometimes removed due to facial expression giveaways, hard to combat this in a game that's meant to be light and casual. Having said that, my family really enjoyed this one.

Seems solvable if you agree with your group on what actions to take ahead of time (play left to right, move cards when you know what they are, etc), then is just down to the luck of the cards.

[Abacusspiele 2012 edition] I bought this so that I can preserve my original Hanabi & Ikebana copy.

This is a challenging puzzle games, even for adults.  Players need some tacit agreement to understand the hints being given.  And, players may need to discuss which card / colour to sacrifice in order to get more hints. Even though this is a cooperative game, it is also a social game.  And, it's funny if you have a team member spoils the game plan.

The illustration and token of this version is better than the first edition.

Rule difference: the German rules allow a player to say "You don't have blue cards", but the English rules from RnR games disallow it.  I prefer to allow giving a hint of no colour / number cards, i.e. the German rules.

Not the most fun with 2 players, and a little cumbersome with 5. Hitting the sweet spot with 3 or 4 really makes this game shine as a challenging experience without being too frustrating. The most difficult part for new players I've found is making sure they don't look at their hand/drawn cards.

Took me a while to warm to this game, mainly because it is HARD at first. But I persevered and played with several different groups of people and now feel like I'm developing a solif strategy. At the moment my interest feels at a peak for Hanabi, I always want to play it, but I'm conscious that, like with other co-ops, once I've hit on a "solution" that interest may wane.

RATING: 7
Original and fun co-operative card game. The object is to create runs of cards based on colour and number under the premise that they are fireworks in a display. The innovative part is that you hold your cards away from yourself so that only your fellow players can see what you are holding. Clues are then given based on how many cards of a certain colour a player is holding or how many cards of a certain number. From this information a player has to decide which of their cards to play in the hope that it will add to a run. The game is far trickier than it first appears and shouldn't be taken too seriously, especially when often it is impossible to complete the game perfectly because of too many higher value cards being drawn at the start of the game. I commend the originality of designer Antoine Bauza because 'Hanabi' is unlike any game of its type that I have played before.

Laura's Rank (4/15) – 3.5 out of 5. Pros: Easy to learn. Fairly quick. Suspenseful. High player interaction (obviously). Can be played anywhere. Cons: More guessing at times than strategy, so sometimes you have to take some risks instead of critically thinking (this might be a pro for me, actually, but could be a con for others). The theme is light, but that doesn't bother me too much either.

Ryan's Rank (4/15) – 3.5 out of 5. I like that this game is easy to learn and relatively quick to play, with a fair amount of angst built into it. However, for some reason the suspense can bother me at times because the theme is pasted on. Still, a good game that is super portable, understandable for newbies, and a good introduction into a light co-op game.

Overall Rank (4/15) – 7.0 out of 10

This cooperative game is definitely in the filler category. 
It's simple yet interesting rules make it really good for what it is. It's quite abstract and can demand serious brain power but also can be played in a more lazy way if the whole group is up to that.

I would not play this too often but as a filler here and there it's great.

A wonderful group deduction game that offers difficult decisions and a relatively short play time. It can be prone to luck of the draw/discard at times. The other great thing about the game is that it's highly interactive even though you hardly speak and try not give away any non-verbal clues. This and The Resistance are like opposite sides of the same coin.

The cards in both the AS and R&R versions are quite thin though the AS have more 'flick' to them, fit better in the box and have better graphic design (for colour-blind players) and more easily distinguishable colours (green/blue and white/yellow are confusing in R&R).  But if R&R is the only version available it's still worth the money.

8>9

Got this on the cheap at Essen 2013. German version, but the game itself is language independent, and English rules are easy to come by.

[EDIT] Played this at a family gathering. Unusual game, fun to figure out what should happen. Thrives on 'unspoken' codes, as so many other cardgames (Bridge, 'Rikken' etc). 
This is both a boon and a downfall. A boon, as you can pull off really smart plays. A downfall, as if you don't get the sign, everyone (not only your teammate) will potentially berate you because of your suboptimal move.

Surprised it gets such high ratings, must be typical gamers fare. Mechanic is new and refreshing and that gives 0.5 extra and some replay value as well. Still, I can see this be traded away in the near future.

A fast co-op game that seems to solve many of the problems inherent in co-op games. That makes it a pretty unique and fun challenge.

There are genuine moments of stress and tension as you try to make decisions based on what seems to be imperfect information.

Update: Playing this a lot with the same groups (my family and also a few close gaming buddies) is massively rewarding, though we work hard not to develop codes or systems to cheat and play by fairly strict rules - in that you can ask a player what they know about their hand, but if they are incorrect you can only correct them by spending a clue to give them information again. I do still enjoy playing it with new players because it is wonderful to see a new player 'get it', especially when you've set up a move in advance and they suddenly work out why they've been given a clue previously.

Rating up from 7.1 to 8 and then up again to 9 (provided people aren't cheating). And finally, after 48 players, up to a perfect 10!

I've decided after 80 plays to go ahead and move this up to a 10.  I don't give many 10's.  And I never give them out right off the bat.  (I use a different style rating system)  But I love this game.  And the thing about this one is the better you get at it.  The more fun it becomes and the more interesting the situations that you get in get.

It is interesting playing this with people and growing as a group, but later, I think playing with others makes the group dynamic kind of interesting as well, and sometimes frustrating.  I'm happy to play this anytime.

Description of the game made me wonder what could be there, but when it showed up at my local store I picked it up to see what it was about.  I will admit I was pleasantly surprised.  We pull this out for a couple of rounds almost every game session now and we enjoy the challenge.

Hát nem tudom...Valahogy túl könnyű a játék. Lehet, hogy elrontottunk valamit, de így nem volt élvezetes. Hiába csak számot vagy színt lehet elárulni, szinte mindig elárulható a kettő együtt, hiszen ha lent van 3 2-es és valakinek azt mondom egyik lapjéra hogy az 2-es, akkor józan ésszel nézve is az a 2-es biztos olyan színű ami még nincs lent....És így nem igazán kihívás megcsinálni akár a 25 pontot. Sajna eléggé nem tetszett, így nem biztos hogy előkerül újra...

Not so easy to build the rows because you only see the cards of the other players. 

Say someone what card he has is an action. There are only a limited number of this actions. You must clear this actions, but but to clear you discard a card. When you don`t know your cards you can discard a card that you need. You must manage this action, so all players can do something that is required.

That`s all fresh, but i have one problem with this game. If i know we don`t get the maximum amount of points, i lose my attention. When we don`t get 25 points we lose, when we lose who cares how many points we have.

The other problem is you can`t talk. But you can`t play in silence. When you say something apparently no important you can influence other player moves because you involuntarily will suggest something. 

Must play more to see if this is a big problem for me.

EDIT: With 2 players to random. If you don`t have low cards, you ca do nothing. With more players still intersting.

Great little cooperative deduction game. Five or six suits (with some options on how to use the sixth suit). Each suit is three 1s(?), two 2-4, one 5. You see others' cards but not your own. Each turn you can try to play a card, using one of five(?) lives if it's unplayable; discard a card, gaining a hint token; or play a hint token to tell a player which of his cards are a particular number or suit/color. Then, you have to logic through why the player asked the question they did.

Hanabi is an interesting twist on the co-op game, so that there's more to it than whether the deck was randomized favorably. Unfortunately a 2-hour session rather killed my enthusiasm for the game (nth-order logic for 18/25; for what it's worth I've hit 20+/25 with buzzed people who were just firing from the hip). There needs to be tight adherence to the limitations on what players are allowed to say; can you imagine Bridge if people were allowed to discuss convention construction mid auction?

I want to rate Hanabi higher, since it's so novel, but honestly these days I think I could find a better option in my collection. It might still have a place in my library as a good litmus test for overthinking.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this much more than I thought I was going to. I'm not the biggest fan of co-op games, let alone co-op games that appear to be very light. Thankfully, Hanabi is more than the sum of its parts. Unlike co-opts that are heavy on theme, Hanabi is all about player interaction. It's more or less the abstract game of co-opts. Everyone at the table must work together to develop a means of communication. There isn't anything else there to keep your interest, and therefore Hanabi has to rely on the strengths of its design. Luckily, it performs admirable.

Knowing what everyone else is holding, and hoping that they will all interpret your clues correctly, is very tense. Selecting a card of my own to play, and hoping that I interpreted everyone else's clues correctly, is unbearable in a very enjoyable way. I'm hoping I don't screw up, and yet at the same time there is a certain devilish delight in watching other people struggle.

I suspect that playing the game with the same group will allow for the development of a system, which will ultimately make the game more dependent on the luck of the draw. It's also a game that is open to cheating, but who wants to play with people who would do that anyway -- especially in a co-opt. That all said, for such a straightforward card game, Hanabi delivers. It's not the most fun I've had playing a game, but it's a solid entry for a few hands in a row.

I enjoyed this game at first, but after a couple of playthroughs I got tired of it very quickly. It didn't help that I developed a strategy for winning which seems to me entirely within both the letter and the spirit of the rules, yet this has been deemed "cheating" by our group, with no-one being able to give a satisfactory explanation as to why.

I love cooperative play games. You lose and win together. This one is more of a ranking with really only one way to lose. You determine as a group how strict you are with the rules. Are you allowed to say what your last hint was? can you ask the player what they think/know about his or her hand? Either way, it's a feel good game by the end.

RATING: 5
I want to like this game, because it encourages communication. But with all the table talk and conventions that unavoidably get adopted in the course of the game, I feel that it is impossible not to cheat in this game. Also suffers from a serious case of quarterbacking and public shaming, because everyone knows that a card is wrong except for the person playing it. Even when playing online, I have been asked to play with certain conventions. I feel that the game is broken, though the mechanism of not seeing your own cards is intriguing. I won't like to play it again at gatherings, because it requires too much memory and too much energy in mediation when unhappiness creeps in due to quarterbacking.

Really clever co-op card game with simple but challenging mechanics. You're trying to get a high score, not "beat the game," so it ends up being quite addictive as you keep trying to top yourselves. It's also just as good with two players as it is with a group. The compact size means it travels well, and the quick play time (which isn't dependent on number of players) makes it a great addition for the end of a night or to kill some time before dinner. I was not overly impressed with the quality of components, though, but it's so cheap it doesn't matter much. Also, if you're a stickler for by-the-books rules, you'll have a hard time with the ambiguity of what constitutes cheating and what doesn't in terms of allowed communication--you simply have to set that standard in your individual group.

Hanabi is getting a lot of love from a lot of people, but it seems more of a clever, slightly above average game to me. And even more, I don't see it having high replayability - once I've seen this pony's trick a few times it loses some of its luster. All that said, Hanabi is fun with the right crowd and is a fine game ... just not the superior game its hype would lead you to believe.

RATING: 5
:thumbsup: The gameplay is unique and it requires a type of thinking and interaction that I haven't seen elsewhere.
:thumbsup: When we first started playing, my girlfriend and I found it hilarious how bad we are at communicating with each other.
:thumbsup: Gameplay example. You give your teammate an efficient but tricky clue, and you really hope that she thinks the way you think. But she doesn't trust her own understanding of your clue, thinking, "Would he really mean it this way, or am I just taking it way too far?" All the while you're sitting across from her thinking, "Yes, that's exactly what I meant! Come on, just DO IT!" And finally your teammate decides to play it safe, and in doing so does something stupid.
:thumbsup: The game is tiny, dirt cheap, and has good quality cards.
[b][color=green]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:?block: The game has a memory component, as you need to remember all the clues you were given. And when you forget a clue, which is very disappointing seeing how clues are very valuable, most likely you will just ask your teammates to give you this clue again for free. This is against the rules, but of course can be house-ruled.
[b][color=red]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:thumbsdown: Communication restrictions are the whole game in Hanabi. Yet, the rulebook encourages you to play the game the way you like and doesn't give a comprehensive list of what is and isn't allowed to say or do in order to create the intended gameplay experience. E.g., it doesn't specify if players are allowed to reorder their cards specifically to communicate to others what they are going to discard next if not given any clues not to.
:thumbsdown: In order to play the game your group must create and agree on a series of conventions (like the reordering one I described above), none of which are offered to you in the rulebook. This is the whole strategy in Hanabi: creating a meta game where players all play in a specific way to allow them to communicate the maximum amount of information sort of within the rules. Discussions between games are more important than how you play during a game, at least initially.
:thumbsdown: One of the problems with player conventions is how you're going to remember them if you revisit the game after an extended period of time. Or if you play with a new person, you'll need to explain the way you play so they can play on the same level with you, and this can be hard and non-intuitive.

You have to think how the other person thinks. I also played this with 4 and 5 people. One game with the 5 group, we where cheating pretty bad by saying, "Your face is looking red, oh by the way you have a 2." It was so much fun though.

RATING: 8
Very interesting experience. Not knowing your own hand creates a lot of tension when you pull out a card and hope you understood the hints of the other players right. "Mh, these three cards are yellow. We need a 3, and he told me that these two cards are 4s. Does this mean the other one is a 3?" Although the rules prevent table talk, with four players there is still some discussion going. With two players, it is more a silent thinking game.

For some reason Hanabi has never really hit me the way it has so many other people. I think it's okay, but it seems like once your metagame quickly gets to a certain point, games play out about the same way each time. The deluxe edition helps because you now don't have to hold cards in a certain way and you can more easily remind yourself about your tiles because you can orient them in more ways.

I think it's okay and I'll play it when asked, but it would never be my first choice.

Update: Now that Beyond Baker Street is out, there's no reason to ever play Hanabi. BBS copies Hanabi one for one, and then adds a few more improvements to it along with a much nicer presentation.

Fun co-op game. It's pretty tight and easy to explain. It has two flaws: it's too easy to cheat by accident, and it can be tricky when a new player joins and has to pick up all the signals playing a particular card sends out. The former is a much more serious problem, the latter is more of a minor annoyance. I do enjoy playing it now and again, though.

Even though its co-op, the hidden hand mechanic makes it very hard and eliminates all risk of a power player. Great game and hard as hell. Tons of strategy to develop and learn as you play the game more and more. And its hard as hell. Still have not gotten a perfect game. 

Bumped to a ten because I keep having more and more fun playing this game and want to get a friggin 25!

I have nothing new to add to what has already been said.  It is a very cool take on co-op games and I understand why some people love it, particularly the fact that the uber-boss can't just tell everyone what to do. My different game groups never have that problem, so it is not a selling point for me.

I enjoy the game, but I believe the shine will wear off pretty quickly.  We will see if I am right, but even if I am it is a unique game and a terrific value.

Update: this game is curious in that one wants to discuss conventions to better communicate but even that feels like cheating. Would a bridge-like set of "bidding" conventions ruin the game? Probably. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5

Very fun both with new players and experienced.

With new players just explaining the rules and playing the game is silly and it doesn't matter if we win or lose. Everyone just loves it for how unique the game is.

With experienced players who now have habits on how they discard or hold their cards and card counting it becomes a very intense game of trying to get a perfect 25 and high level thinking of what a clue meant in the context of the rest of the game state.

I love the idea of a card game where you can't see your own hand. The cards are colorful and the theme is unique. However, there is something about this game my husband and I cannot seem to grasp. We enjoy other cooperative games like Forbidden Island--so we know how to communicate, and heavier strategy games like Descent--so we're no strangers to thinking through our turns, but we are annoyingly bad at this game. I want to enjoy it so much, but I guess it may just not be for us.

I love the concept to this game, having cards in your hand that you can't see is very unique. It's a blast and a great challenge. It replays really well, and it plays quickly, so playing with a small group of friends is really is to do because you can pull it out whenever.

Hanabi teaches how to work as a team, and that is a great point. But after the first games, when team learn how to communicate, the 20-25 points' threshold is no longer a dream.

[thing=98778][/thing] is a fairly light cooperativa game in which the players work together to save a fireworks presentation. Just, you know, not really. The theme makes only a brief appearance in the rules and then is left to the side - don't be fooled: [thing=98778][/thing] is an abstract game, but it is easy to sell things with even a shameful pasted-on theme.

In a given turn the player has three options:
- play a card;
- discard a card;
- give an information.

This last one is what makes the game, because the player can't look the front of the cards they will have in hand. Therefore they will only know which ones they have because of the informations given by the others. The information can be about a color or a number - and is allowed (and necessary) to point the card(s) out. But every information given takes away a time token, and there are only eight of them. To bring time tokens back, is necessary to discard a card, however this can, of course, means that a row of colors won't be completed. The play a card is the most straightforward: choose a card and play it on the table, putting it in the proper row (color-wise and number-wise). If the card can't be added to any row or start any row, it is discarded and one of the wick tokens - if three of the wick tokens are discarded the game is over.

The game also ends if:
- the draw pile is empty;
- all the rows are completed.

[thing=98778][/thing] fights one of the most common problems related with cooperative games: the alpha player, simply because, when it is not the players turn, he/she just can't say anything regarding the game, not even facial or body tips. But is a silence table a happy table? Surprisingly, it is. First because we never stop talking, it just won't happen, but we don't interfere with the choices made by others. Second, we aren't, at least by now, good at it - and is fun when the player puts is hand in the forehead and says: "I don't remember which card is the two!" or when someone plays the wrong card.

I'm concern with replay value. I just can't say if the challenge of going from 21 to 22 or a few points more. Sure, until the perfect 25, I guess it will be easier to gather players. But the games aren't really feel different one from the other. Time will tell.

By now [thing=98778][/thing] made a good impression in everyone in my group that played it, even one or two that went to play with the mindset of not-like the game. And this is a major win for it.

RATING: 5
Yes, I'm giving a 5 to the "Spiel des Jahres 2013". To be honest, this is an ingenious little game; a bargain, no matter how much you pay for it. But how much fun it is really depends on who is playing it. Some will want to add house rules, others will quickly get mad if the players communicate too much. For me, it is missing a proper challenge - rewarding a collaborative team of players simply with points in the end is just ... unsatisfying. (See Pandemic for a collaborative game with plenty of challenges.)

I am not that fond of coops. That is the reason for the low score because Hanabi is a decent little game that does not play like any other game I have tried.

Probably the finest game there is for demonstrating the innovation in modern game design to the unfamiliar. The reversed hands thing is about the cleanest, most immediately striking, and most irresistible shorthand that this game is something different. 

On top of that, the game system at large has a flexibility built in which few do: you can offer or withhold clues of intonation and body language as the group desires.

A highlight of one particular family holiday was playing this each night with my parents and wife. No other modern game have my parents taken to like this one.

Good:
-Co-operative
-Gateway game
-Deeper in strategy than it looks
-Easy to keep track of cards you can't miss play
-Card backs have a black corner which helps remember hints

Bad:
-Some players will forget what is in their hands
-Forgetting hints can really aggravate some players
-Players may blame other players for not giving a hint
-Theme
-Five players is pushing it
-Extremely slow players can make this game torture

Overall:
It's a great game that can be taught to anyone no matter their experience with board games.  If your group does not like to point fingers and pass blame, it's a must have.  If they do, just remind them that it's the team's fault for giving them too many hints, poor hints, or not asking them what they know about their hand often enough.  For some reason, this game seems to go over great in predominately female crowds.

Took me about 5 years to finally try this game with my wife. I always thought The hidden hand mechanic was interesting, but co-op games have never been our thing. My wife enjoys card games though, so we cracked it open one evening to give it a try. It's a good challenge and quick fun when you don't feel like something heavy or competitive.

I'd give Baker Street the edge over this one in terms of gameplay, but Hanabi is smaller, and quicker to setup and play.

Great co-op game. Beautiful elimination of the alpha-gamer problem by making communication part of the mechanics. Creates great tension and mind-games as you try to guess what other players will do based on what they know you know they know etc, and requires you to make every action meaningful on multiple levels.

Great with 2 players and great with 5, and has plenty of ways to house-rule it to be more or less difficult. My current (as of this writing) favorite pure co-op game, next to Ghost Stories.

Most of the plays are for 2-player only-- I really like it because it's so different from every other game.

I bought this one because it is cooperative and had many great reviews. I find it to be a tedious exercise in memory. The reversed cards is a clever spin, but I simply can't remember the makeup of my hand from one turn to the next. And I found the instructions a bit unclear regarding the nature and quantity of information allowed to be shared in clues.
With a select group of highly focused individuals, this could be a fun challenge.

10-06-2015 update... I have revisited Hanabi and have several recent plays. I approached it with a new attitude and am enjoying it more and more. I am raising my rating to 7.0.

One of my favorite games to have learned, improved, improved some more, and then discussed strategy with my friends and drastically improved some more.  The best part is that those final improvements do not require any unspoken system of cheating, giving information without counting clues, or agreed upon code.  Instead it just required discussing the safest assumptions to make while playing and agreeing to give clues assuming others will behave logically.  If everyone is willing to trust that an awkward clue was given for a truly logical reason they can often puzzle out what much more information about their own hand from the information they can see around them.  This game can be played casually (alright), seriously (very good), or extremely hardcore (perfection itself to the right players who enjoy that kind of thing).

Impressive game. On paper, I would never expect a concept like this to work, but it does and it works well.

Hanabi is a cooperative game that plays a bit like Solitaire or Hearts where you try to place cards on stacks in the right order. Each person has a hand of cards, and there's a deck to draw from. The really interesting part is you play with your hands backwards -- you can see everyone else's hands, but you cannot see your own. Yet you still play cards from that hand. The other players use up hints to get you to figure out which cards to play or discard.

Sounds simple, but this is a really intense psychological game that can be very stressful. When you give hints to someone, you want to convey as much information, and expose as many potential actions as possible. In order to figure this out, it's not just about what cards the player has in their hand: you also have to factor in their experience with the game, their personality traits, and really dig into their brain. Not only that, but they're going to do the same to *you* when receiving your hint. You can't do or give away any information except for the hint, and you should try to do your best pokerface. Brilliant game.

There's so many stipulations about playing this game, and that's what holds me back from giving it a higher rating. I saw footage of a Hanabi tournament, and I really don't understand how something like that could even exist, unless the players were in isolated rooms. Even something as small as an eye twitch can be enough to tip someone off. Still, for making such a bold concept work, this is really fantastic.

Takes the simple idea of the poker game where you can see everybody elses card, but your own. Except now it's a cooperative game and you can give other players hints on what their cards are (colors, numbers). However, you can only give so many hints until you finally need to make a play. Other than that the game plays a bit like team solitaire. I really like it and it's a great filler.

I was scared of the game for a while because my memory is so bad, but it's actually more about problem solving and deduction. I enjoyed it the team effort required in the game.

I don't even normally like Co-Ops because I never feel like they really are a team-effort, but this simple card game accomplishes that.  You're struggling together, giving clues and taking risks together all hoping you can succeed as a team.  It's good fun!

[+] easy to teach, great idea (again), love the fact that gameplay eveolves when playing with the same group of people (you start 'getting' what other playing want you to get when they give you a clue)
[-] after a few plays, it fell a little flat. On one hand, I like being able to get more info from a clue than its literal meaning, on the other hand, it makes the game so easy when you start 'getting' the hidden meaning of your partners clues

A game this small and simple can't possibly be this good, but it is.  This is incredibly simple, and wonderful fare for extended family get-togethers or other places where you don't have a group that has a lot of tolerance for rules.  The deduction here is crisp, it's very difficult to get a good score, and there's a wonderful group dynamic that keeps everybody involved.  The best simple game that has come out since [gameid=2842].

RATING: 6.5
Hanabi is a co-op deduction game, where you're trying to build up the cards from 1 to 5 in each of five colours. The trick is, you can't see your own cards that you play. So the players give clues to each other.

For example, I might point to Bob's leftmost card and say "this card is Red". The next player might say to Bob "Your leftmost and rightmost cards are twos". Now Bob knows that his leftmost card is a Red 2, and if the Red 1 is already on the table, then he knows he can play it and we've scored a point.

The problem is remembering all the info you've been given, it's very easy to lose track. And there are a limited number of clues that can be given, so you often have to guess because you don't have enough info. Did Bob tell me "this card is a 3" because he wants me to play it, or because he wants me to discard it? If you throw away too many cards, you can get stuck in a colour, if we throw away both 2s, then the 3-5 cards can never be played, for example.

Short and fun, I could see bringing this out occasionally.

While interesting, I have fundamental problems with the design of limited communication in this game, maybe with hard core gamers it would be better but with casual gamers it's just too hard to squash conventions, excitement, etc. Convincing others, and sometimes myself, to play a game where showing excitement is cheating is just a little much.

So simple, so impossible to beat! Great cooperative game, difficulty level keeps you coming back for more. I understand that you don't need a perfect score to technically have a good game but that elusive perfect score is what it is all about. Best part of this cooperative game is that no one can take over and dominate the game. Also, very quick and easy to teach, and the games are short so replay-ability is very high. This is one of those games where 4 hours later someone is still saying "just one more game," and we all eagerly agree.

This is a very good co-op wich plays very different from other games that I have played. Getting the maximum will be very hard but we'll keep trying.

Each player takes 5 cards but holds them blindley. Only the other players can see them. Your goal is to create the biggest firework. There are 5 colors with numbers from 1-5. You have lay the correct card on the correct colour. You pick the cards with the advice you get from your co-players. But there are only 8 tokens for advice. 

So give advice (cost 1 token), play a card (and take a new one), discard a card (and regain 1 token). If you play a card and you're wrong, 1 thundertoken is turned over. At 3 you lose automatically.

I'm no fan of cooperative games, but this one has a unique feel that makes it feel less like a cooperative game, and more like you're playing against an invisible player.  It's a deduction game that blends some of the best parts of Code 777 (deducing the cards you have in front of you, which everyone else can see but you can't) and Sleuth (limiting the questions you can ask to deduce what you have), and it works remarkably well.  I can see this being a good filler game, and a good game for playing with families.

I gave Hanabi a 9 rating for it's price, replay ability, elegance, ease of getting to the table, and ease of teaching.  I have played this game about 20 times over the last six months, with many different groups.  The game plays in 10-25 minuets, depending on number of players and how many new players there are.  What this games does well is have a very low price, and a very easy way of getting to the table.  You may love a big, epic game, but this small box game will get far more plays for the price.

This game also makes a great gift for new board game players, and is perfect for vacations!

This game is FUN. Yes, even with just two players. It strikes the right balance between quick gameplay and "thinky-ness". The fact that you need to communicate with limited options adds a neat social component to it. The fact that you build together on a common goal that is laid out clearly on the table in front of you adds to the tension. The fact that this features basically a non-existing theme and really is just an abstract game is quickly forgotten thanks to all the difficult choices you have to make. Hanabi certainly falls into the category of addictive games that you will not play for one round only. The only reason that this is not a perfect 10 for me is that this game is not strong enough to fully carry itself, but depends on the company you play it with (you depend on the other player - and their memory).

After a few more plays down-graded to 8 due to the anti-climactic ending that can feel like a bit of a letdown.

RATING: 10
I thought this would light and fun but find it tense. Tense and fun, very rewarding when you do make progress I'm excited to play this more. I do play with 'non-gamers' and I think it needs to be really understood that the top score is not the expected score, you don't 'lose' if you don't achieve this.

Have upgraded the score because the more I play the more I think this is a masterpiece. I'm not always keen to play it but I do think it is a fantastic design in terms of the simplicity but complexity of actual play. The way that complexity is does not feel to cerebral but feels very joyous because it is a shared experience. When played properly it is a real marvel of a game. If I had to recommend one game to someone who had never played games before and was unlikely to play again, I would recommend this because I think it is an experience everyone should enjoy at least once.

 I love cooperative games and I pick this one up thinking it would be a big hit. Unfortunately the rules make a cooperation so limited that it loses a lot of it's fun and the great communication that really comes from a great cooperative experience. Played it about five times and finally moved it on.

As an aside Implayed the deluxe, tile Hanabi, with the addition of small colored dice that helped you track your clues given and then I found it quite enjoyable. So removing the memory aspect and focusing on the deduction really improves the game play for me.

Great concept - let the others describe your own cards to you and then try to memorize what they said about cards. The problem with the game is that it only really works with people that understand the value of the various types of information and how that changes from situation to situation. You should also be able to judge how well they understand the game concept to know how to act on their information.
The game really looses if people start to use a secret language since the amount of information conveyed becomes too big so the games gets unbalanced.

Understandably, some folks won't like failing but you know, failure is a big thing in games, I think more people need to learn to appreciate it as per pretty much all co-op games.

Before I launch into a monologue on Chvátil, I'll just say that Hanabi is cheap, quick and a ton of fun. Play it at least once or twice!

Feels like a classic card game in its simplicity. Standup and cheer moments. I've found it difficult to introduce to non-hobby gamers, but that appears to be the opposite of everyone else's experience.

RATING: 10
Easy to learn, but hard to win, Hanabi is one of the best collaborative games out there. 

To win, players should collect cards of the same color in order. The trick is that they can see other players cards, but not their own. To solve the puzzle, players have to share clues, but communication is extremely limited, so only teams in perfect harmony will succeed.

Super Stressful game. Not knowing what you are holding in your hand and having to guess what to play is nerv racking.  Having 8 guesses is NOT enough even for 3 players.  Still a fun game to play and great little filler that keeps you thinking.

RATING: 10
Hanabi is one simple but brilliant idea that makes for a great game. I think this game is more about social interaction than deduction. The fun of it comes from constantly balancing on the edge of cheating, and seeing how the group bends the rules and forms new habits.

It feels more like an interesting puzzle than a game. I'm not sure I enjoyed it as much as I wanted to. Has some of the rising tension of other cooperative games, except it doesn't feel like you're doing anything worthy of that tension. Didn't deserve the SdJ.

A cooperative card game.
The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered 1 to 5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from 1 to 5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and win before they run out of cards.

This is a great logic puzzle-type game that can get pretty deep with a very simple set of rules.  In my honest opinion, there are some BGGers who don't give this game enough credit.  I do not feel this game is "light" or a "filler".  It is a great challenge and very difficult.

Edit (April, 2015)-Although I still believe this game is not a filler game, I have now opened up to different ways to play this game.  If you have a group that would play this game in a light-hearted manner, being a little silly or bending the rules a bit (your fourth and FIFTH cards are blue...), then that is just dandy. This game works for serious players as well as very casual players.

This game is certainly unique. It's very hard to remember not to look at cards when drawing them. It's also difficult not to "cheat" by accidentally giving extra information, either through tone of voice or facial expression or some other means. The main problem is that some of the colors (white/yellow, green/blue) are hard to distinguish in low light.

A simple twist on what would otherwise be a pretty dull co-operative card game! Be warned, Hanabi is not really a filler. It takes a lot of focus but everyone I've played with ends up invested in helping each other. The shared moments of joy when someone plays the card you were all hinting at and crushing despair when someone misreads the group make this a truly memorable little game. After this, I'm utterly convinced that some of my friends are psychic!

Hanabi is an abstract, number-based game of cooperative deduction and inference.  As terrible as that sounds, it's actually pretty good.

I don't know whether Hanabi has an infinite shelf life, but with 15 plays behind me I still find myself suggesting it to close friends and random strangers whenever I have a half hour to spare. 

As a big mark in its favor, Hanabi is unusual in that playing with people who are new to the game can be more fun than playing with old hats, as there's a genuine sense of satisfaction in indirectly helping novice teammates to deduce information, play and discard cards, and generate multi-step clues.  And invariably people want to play twice in a row to apply what they learned from their low-scoring first play.

So, for now, Hanabi presses all the right buttons.  It's sleek, clean, thoughtful, and inexpensive - and it takes only 5 minutes to explain and 20-30 minutes to play. Best of all, loudmouth players (like me) are forbidden from giving advice to their teammates during the game.

A win all around.

Exceptional cooperative game. You do not know what cards you hold. You can see the other players cards. The mechanism for gaining information is very well designed. This is a thinkers game. A few plays are needed for most people to recognize when and what to do. It is still a challenge to experienced players. I like it.

Wonderful game, if you haven't played it, you're doing yourself a disservice.

Tiles make it easier to play the game compared to holding cards, though they are not very attractive. 

Gameplay is very innovative, with the alpha player issue neatly avoided in this design. However, it is rather difficult to play strictly by the rules; One can easily to let slip some hints to other players. Replayability may also be on the low side.

Rating based on deluxe edition.

Hanabi has gone up in my estimation the more I have played it. I really enjoy the logic and deduction thinking process that the game encourages. Sometimes it can be stressful because you don't want to make a poor choice in front of people and look dumb! This is half the enjoyment of the game for me though since it makes me concentrate and care.

I find Hanabi more fun than it should be. The tension is lovely.

Not only it requires good cooperation, it also requires good understanding and telepathy between players. It's simple, but fun.

RATING: 5
Fun as a filler. As a former Euchre enthusiast, I don't like the meta game of deciding as a group what is the best play in each situation. It feels like at that point the decisions are being made for me and there are no interesting new variations. Weird meta-game optimization.

This game can be a short filler while waiting for other games to finish, but the artwork is lacking.  Thankfully there is a lot of beautiful fan art work available to print and play with.  Added to my list of future projects.

I've only played with 2 and 3, but it has gone well every time. You feel like your decisions have weight to them, and the use of timer and fuse buttons gives a sense of urgency. There's nothing especially complex or heavy about this game, but it's highly original and worth $10 even if you only play it a few times.

Nate bought me a copy at Con of the North as a "Valentine's Day present"  Thanks Nate!!!

A co-op card game where you need to collectively play your cards in a certain order... but you can't look at the cards in your hand.  You give your teammates clues about what colors and numbers they have in their hand while they give you clues to decipher the best cards to play.  Play too many cards out of sequence and the game ends. No set win condition, playing to the highest total possible is enough of a goal to keep the game interesting.

Inside the box are 60 cards, 8 clue tokens and 3 lightning tokens. Each player gets 4 cards (5 in a 2-player game) and hold them in their hands facing towards the other players. On a players turn he can do 1 out of 3 actions.

    Give a clue
    Discard a card
    Play a card

1.) When a player decides to give a clue, he turns over a clue token to the dark side, which means the clue is used. He can give two different kind of clues. First kind is to tell the one color of the cards. He can say that, that & that card is red. Or he can tell the number of the cards. This & this is a 3. Trick of this is, that if he decided to tell what cards are red, he has to tell of all the red cards. Same goes on which telling numbers. He has to tell where all of the 3’s are situated. When all 8 clue tokens (7 in a 2 player game) are on the dark side, a player may not give any clue.

2.) When a player decides to discard a card, he places a hand card faced up on the discard tile. He turns over a clue token to the light side (which will be available then again), and takes a new card.

3.) When a player thinks he has enough information he can play a card onto the table. If a cards fits a row, it can be played. If it doesn’t fit, lightning will strike and a lightning tokes is flipped over to the other side. Basically you will be trying to add the next consecutive number until all 5 stacks have a 5 on top.

The games ends when lightning stroked 3 times or the pile of cards is empty. Players add together the highest value of a card in each row. This will be their score. Goal of the game is to get 25 points, but this will be a very hard job to fulfill.

The better the memory of a player is, the easier it will be for him. Because of the clue tokens, the clues that can be given are very limited, and you always want to give more clues. Although it is a cooperative game, it will be very silent in the room, as nothing can and might be said if a clue isn’t given. The concept of the turned around cards is new to us, and very different.  It’s supposed to be a filler game, but after playing once, you want to play it again. And again. And again…

RATING: N/A
For being such a simple concept, this game is deceptively hard. In the 20 odd games that I've played, I've never 'beaten' it. There are extra cards to make the game harder, but I honestly don't think they're needed if you play the game by the spirit of the rules.

One of the more interesting takes on co-operative gaming.  I think my only reason for not liking it more is that it is an abstract game, which i find doesn't lend itself to enticing me into playing often.  
Having said that, it's a challenge worth trying.  The game isn't really a *loose-able* game, so your only real challenge is to do better than previously.  And that can be interesting in between games trying to come up with a *fool-proof* way to do better.  
A good filler game.

This is a neat little co-op that has the potential to produce a lot of laughs, or make people pissed off at each other, or both. It's simple, yet challenging, and there's often a "just one more try" feeling which is great. But I do think the enjoyment factor is somewhat dependent on having the right group of players.

Hanabi is a very different co-op game. There's no quarterbacking in this game - everyones own choices and trust in each other is vital to success!

The most entertaining moments in hanabi are seeing how your friends interpret your clues, even if it goes poorly!

Nice concept, and I probably wouldn't turn down a game. However you really need to play this one with the right group of players. It gets very annoying when they're not into it at all. (However that's the case with a lot of games)

Great inexpensive game out of an outstandingly original idea!
It's very difficult to avoid "cheating", being that intentional or not, but this just adds to the fun.

I usually dislike co-ops, but this isn't like any other of its kind. I feel like we're not working together against the game, instead we're more working together to help each other getting through it.

Probably the most amazing cooperative game ever. I have not played this original, but only the fan-made spinoff, but the basic principle is the same: You see everyone else's cards, but not your own, and the collective goal is to get out all cards in the right order. You can inform your teammate which of his card(s) are of a certain number or colour. This turns into a hilarious co-op work to get people to understand more than just the basic thing you just said. Amazing. Downright amazing. Truly and absolutely amazing.

We played a lot of cards as a kid, and my mother always wanted to end the night with a few rounds of Indian Poker. It was a funny way to end a game night, and clearly memorable because some twenty-years later I can remember it. I was giddy when I first came across the grown-up version of her favorite game. Now, if only I could get her to stop cheating when we play ("These TWO cards are red." "This ONE is Green"). My only knock is that in average lighting some of the colors are hard to distinguish (Yellow/White), so we normally substitute the rainbow in as a regular suit.

The cards are beautiful and the game play is fun, but it does leave you feeling drained by the end, which is not normal for such a card game. Holding the cards up is physically tiring and a pain in the wrist. I recommend getting card holders for this. Then, trying to remember what clues you've been given and what clues you need to give to other people is incredibly mentally taxing. This is the most thinky cooperative game I've played.

While I like thinky games, the taxing quality of this and basically themeless game play does not make it a popular hit at the table and it doesn't come out often.

Super funny game! When I bought, I was thinking is a party game...but if you playing seriously is a lot more! In the beginning I bought the EXTRA version, with cards holders inside and GIANT cards! After, because everybody really loved it, I also bought the DELUXE version in wooden box... I simply adore Antoine Bauza's games!

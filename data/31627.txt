Best TTR game out, wish it would support a few more players, but maybe the direct conflict of a small map with a few players is what makes it good.

RATING: 5
My favorite of the TTR series. Small/cramped, and sort of unforgiving. It also plays fairly quickly (and well) with just 2p. Best when folks don't spend a lot of time deciding on their moves as it's such a tight game that you can see the end written on the wall in the late game phase.

What else to say. On a great game for two or three players.

RATING: 6.5
Yet another expansion to Ticket to Ride shamelessly produced and priced as a whole board game.

This variation is actually quite good in that it plays specifically for 2-3 players similar to the Switzerland map.  Not sure why it wasn't packaged in a similar fashion.

After a couple of plays, I think I like it even a bit more than the Swiss expansion. There's no unbalanced country-to-country ticket situation to encounter. Having ferries and tunnels adds some interesting play tactics. Dangling that massive 9 space route out there as a prize can alter people's strategy (though I completed it in my first game AND lost). The game art is very cute with the winter theme. Overall, a real winner for the 2-3 player crowd.

RATING: 7
This is of the same good quality with the rest of the TtR family, i.e., one of the best casual family games in the market.

However, I really do not like the tunnel mechanic with its random take that aspect. In this sense, TtR Nordic Countries is on the same line with TtR Europe. But what sets TtR Nordic apart is that it really shines with 2-3 players. Compared to the original game, the board of Nordic version is also much tighter with low player numbers forcing the players to make some early plays instead of just hoarding cards. And compared to the Märklin edition, Nordic edition less fiddly sharing the elegancy of the original.

Original = Best for families with 4-5 players
Märklin = Most satisfactory for gamers
Nordic = Best for families with 2-3 players
Europe = worst of the bunch in all aspects

RATING: 7.43
Rating TTR series as a whole.

My favorite for a 2-3 player version of Ticket to Ride.  Probably doesn't play well with super aggressive players.  In our house we seem to have an unstated gentleman's agreement that you don't claim a route purely to screw another player (i.e, we claim the routes we are using to complete our tickets, we don't just claim routes to prevent others from completing their tickets).  

After a few plays, it is pretty easy to figure out which destinations people are building towards when they make certain moves, so with aggressive players it is very easy to just block a key route and completely break the other person's game (particularly in a two player game where double routes can't be utilized).  If everyone plays aggressively and enjoys it then at the end everyone can laugh about the winner being the person with the negative score closest to zero (aptly described as "Blood in the Snow").  My group tends to not favor that type of play generally, so playing with an aggressive player on this map would likely just spoil the experience.

Quite a high rating, maybe because it works as a three-player if not so well as a game. Its not quite so Baldrickianly brainless as TtR, nor as crap as the Europe game, nor as successful designwise as Marklin. Whoever gets the best cards and tickets win will, though its not impossible that one game in five could be determined by player input.

Despite the fact that this game is very restrictive in number of players, it just fit ok for lesser players. Why I rate it more than the Ticket to Ride Europe and Marklin is simply because I had more fun with this game, I think the rules are more condensed and the dynamics of gameplay works really fine with the great adds of rules in tunnels and ferrys that came before in Europe.

RATING: 6.5
Another installment of TTR, this time for 2-3 players.

Certain route once the first player starts to build it, will block the other players from ever to reach their destination city. So in that sense, it's a rather cut throat game at the initial stage.

The multi use of cards to supplement a Color needed in the ferries and Murmansk route is a very interesting idea.

Overall, a good investment for beginners. Retains the flavour of TTR and still challenging to play.

I love me some TtR and Nordic Countries is great for those smaller player counts. Even with two there's not always all that much blocking, but it's better than any US variant I've encountered. The small, easily gotten choke points add nice tension and it cleanly introduces the more gamey elements of Europe. Plus, it's gorgeous.

Only played couple of games, but like Switzerland better. Still good standalone game, gives more color options for train carts, game comes with black, white and purple train carts so in theory you can play more then 5 people if you have Ticket to Ride USA/Europe on those maps. Can't recommend that though.

This and Switzerland are designed so you can block each other, that rarelly happens in our games, we usually focus on our destination.

A great version of the base game for 2-3 players. Introductions like the tunnels may for additional uncertainties to take into consideration when playing. And the game is definitely more competitive with a smaller playing area.

We enjoyed the original Ticket to Ride but since we were rarely able to play it with three or more players we felt like we were missing out. So we picked up a version designed specifically for 2-3 players and it is awesome. A bit more cutthroat than the original or Europe due to the board size and rail lines. We love this one. Plus the art is even better on this one thanks to the winter theme.

When it all comes down to it, this is probably my favorite version of Ticket to Ride, because I appreciate the snowy Winter/Christmas theme and the tighter gameplay the map brings for 2-3 players.

Another "Ticket to Ride" game. This feels like a light ticket to ride, 'cos it's just a 2 or 3 player game. The game works exactly the same way the others do, except for a few new features - the Ferries and the Tunnels.
The Ferries must use Locomotives cards, usually 1 or 2, and to complete Tunnels you need to draw 3 cards from the stack and if one of those is a match you must play additional cards from your hand to complete the route.
In sum, it's 'still' a simple game and very addictive.

This is probably the better iteration of Ticket to Ride, specially since I mainly play it with 2 players. The map is very cutthroat, the large cards are definitely better than the mini-cards, and the addition of tunnels and ferries makes the gameplay less light, and more enjoyable even by hardcore gamers.

Update august 30th, 2012: after I bought the iOS version of TTR Europe, physical versions of the game had seen play again, and I must admit the light fare is quite enjoyable... vote raised to 7!

Great variant on one of my favorite games!  Plays almost exactly like the original "Ticket to Ride", but has a board specifically designed for 2 or 3 players, which virtually guarantees you will get in each other's way when trying to complete your routes.  This brings in an extra layer of strategy that is capitalized on by the "tunnels" and "ferries" you may have to build, taking away your precious locomotive cards.  Thus, there is a lot more tension when trying to build that 2-car track that used to be so easy before.  I still love the original "Ticket to Ride", but this is a refreshing change of pace and is a great couple's game (probably better than the original in that regard)!

LOVE this version of T2R, very tight and that distribution of the map really makes the center north south track valuable.  Although there is a higher distribution of tickets for the south end of the Nordic countries,m there are still a lot of long north south paths.  The pieces are beautiful as is the board.  It takes a while to get use tot he city names.  it'd be fun to have a US version with just the East Coast so you could have a tight 3 player game with a more familiar map to play with non-gamers.

A good, tight addition to the TTR family. Reminds me of Switzerland in that it only plays up to three players.

This is our new favorite Ticket to Ride game. We normally play 2 or 3 players, so this works great. Switzerland used to be our favorite, but I prefer not to have the country cards so Nordic Countries gets a little bit higher rating than Switzerland. I also like having both ferries and tunnels for variety. The map works quite well for us. There's a lot of interaction which makes for a fun game.

Really like this map for 2 players.  What I liked most was sometimes Switzerland becomes about being who got lucky with the country destinations, and Big Cities 1910 becomes about grabbing the right cities.  This seemed like the best test of who has the mettle to really win a game of ticket to ride.  

*the 8 space chunk
*the wild cards
*the fact that there are SO few red spaces so no one cares to take the red trains
*locomotive ferries on colored routes
*knowing someone needs something and grinding the heck out of the deck with tunnels.

Tom Vasel said this is one of the tougher maps, and I totally agree with him.  You really need to be ready for ticket to ride giving you everything it's got.

A shame that this is only available overseas because it is a good game. A few minor rules changes add a little forgivness into what would otherwise be a rather brutal map. The ticket deck could be a little more balanced by adding more tickets shorter in the northern sector. It's be a toss-up between Nordic Countries and Switzerland as to which one I'd want to play with three players.

Competitive and fun, Nordic Countries is one of the best expansions (and possibly the single best, weren’t the map two or three players only) to Ticket to Ride.

By limiting the usage of locomotive cards and making it really hard to carve one’s path to the northernmost towns, players cannot indulge in the «draw as many cards as you can and then play your tracks as it suits you» strategy anymore, as wavering a turn too much before putting your wagons down on a track might mean the only path to that location is taken by another player. [i](October 2014)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - As fun as it is, Nordic Countries isn’t better than, say, Rails and Sails or Legendary Asia, that I rate a square 8: hence, in November 2017 I lowered my rating from 9 to 7. The original Ticket to Ride deserves to be at the top alone.

Excellent version of Ticket to Ride.  Very, very enjoyable with just two players, much much more so than the base game.

The only thing I don't like is how vitally important locomotives are -- since there are ferries *everywhere* -- which means they're always taken face-up.  So you'll never see three locomotives face-up to flush out all the cards, and they get stale.  You'll see 3 red and 2 green and noone interested in any of them, so we're all just drawing blind and it comes down to whoever got lucky with their draws (because it's REALLY easy to be unlucky, and draw a third of the deck into your hand without finding the one colour  you need).  I think there should be about 50% more locomotives in the deck.

The special rule about allowing a 4-for-1 trade when playing on the big track alleviates this problem a little.  You're drawing blind and getting a giant deck of a hand with no cards you can use, so you can have a little competition to see who complete the 9-long track first.  It's not enough, but it helps.

Üdítő színfolt a Ticket to Ride világában. Az, hogy kevesebb játékosra van készítve úgy mint a Svájc és a kártyákat is átdolgozták a havas világ hangulatára, valami újat ad a megszokott játékmenetbe. Itt nem nagyon lehet kártyát gyűjtögetni, hanem rá kell rontani a megfelelő és szükséges vonalakra, mert különben mások elhappolják és kerülhetünk. Nincs állomás és semmi ami segítségével használhatnánk ugyanazt az utat. A párhuzamos utak használhatóak és kő kemény konfrontáció ez a pálya. Nagyon kedvelem.

The best of the ticket to ride series. I think ticket to ride plays bet with a lower player count. This is because the more players in the game, the less blocking other players comes into play. With 5 players, if you go out of your way to block a player, that player hurts a lot, you hurt a little (having just claimed a route that doesn't benefit your tickers), and the other three players gain from the set back you cased yourself and the targeted player. When the players are reduced to 2 or 3, this blocking strategy is much more viable because there are 2 or 3 less players gaining from the block. So because I feel it plays best with 2 or 3, it makes sense that I play the game on a map designed for two or three. In a addition, this map is brutal having a congested south and a sparse north. I love the theme as well making it a great game to play inside on a cold snowy winter day.

Enjoyable, but it is essentially TTR:Europe on a new map.  There are a few critical routes in the northeast that one player could use to completely block east-west connections, which can be devastating.  For 2-3p, I prefer TTR:Switzerland because I like the tickets with multiple options and the connections to neighboring nations (instead of single cities).

Cutthroat gaming that is guaranteed to suck the fun out of any gathering. 
"Haha you totally got screwed and can't complete any of your tickets while we lapped the scoring track~ let's play again!!!"

Or it's turn number four and you're already minus twenty-one points (basically out of the game) because somebody just claimed both routes out of Honningsvåg.  Do you keep playing knowing that you have an hour of frustration ahead of you with no chance of winning? Or do you, since you've lost the game, sabotage the efforts of your opponents?  So, yes the game does present interesting choices but nothing I would consider remotely fun.

This is a great version of Ticket to Ride for two or three people.  The rules are relatively simple compared to the Europe or Germany maps, and yet the gameplay is more competitive because of the limited number of routes.  The game puts more focus on completing destination tickets, which makes the issue of limited routes all that much more important.  On a more minor note, the snow-themed cards are cute.

Nice components and production quality is overall great. Map of the Nordic Countries is tight and there's a lot of tention from the turn one over the routes. Blocking might be a bit of a problem in this game because destinations can  be guessed rather easily. And the Murmansk route is maybe a bit too good although building it is not too easy.  

I liked TtR: Nordic Countries more than the Switzerland expansion because of the quality of the components and interesting map.

La misma sensación y diversión que TtR:Europe pero a 2/3 jugadores. La única pega es que el desconocimiento de la geografía de los países nórdicos complica la tarea inicial de localización de rutas y las mejores formas de llevarlos a cabo. Además cuando lo juego me trae buenos recuerdos de mi año de Erasmus en Dinamarca. Para jugar a TtR con 2/3 jugadores lo eligiría sin ninguna duda antes que TtR:Europe

Our second DoW game, we had avoided TTR for a long time because it was said to be bad with two.  Well, I finally played it online, and, yeah, I could see how the standard game would be bad with two.  I'd been mulling Nordic Countries for a while, as it is designed just for 2-3, but the high price ($50 everywhere) turned me off.  After I got hooked with the online version, though, and had been primed to enjoy the DoW production values by Cleopatra, well, I was convinced.  I snagged the VERY LAST copy that Boards and Bits had, everywhere else was sold out.  And yes, I'm very happy with it.  Again, amazing production value, simple, concise rules, and game play that just keeps on giving.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants TTR action with fewer players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nordic Countries is tight and unforgiving for a special 3-man cage match of Ticket to Ride. The connections are low and hotly contested across the centre, making the game cutthroat and intense. A great edition of Ticket to Ride, although the box and the gameplay could not be more opposed in theme. The box presents beautiful Scandinavia with snow and light purple colouring and the game presents Ticket to Ride with the idea of war.

I've played this game perhaps 15 times as of Sep 2008. It's one of the wife's favorites. It's a very good 2-person Ticket to Ride, but I think it plays better with three. (I'm partial to 3-players in gaming). 

The only drawback for us is the difficulty with matching the destination cards with the map. Our US-centric lives have not exposed us to the obscure (and fantasy-sounding) cities of northern Europe. Also, it's often the case that the city names are printed one atop the other... and the top most city is actually located at the bottom of the map (and vice-versa)... can be quite frustrating.

BUT, a really good version of TTR. Highly recommended.

It's one of the better TtR maps for 2-3 players, perhaps the best imho! I do like TtR USA with the expansion too for few (and many!) players, and the new India map is great too, so it's not like I would really miss this map, but it's certainly nice to own and play once in a while. I like the limited function of the locomotives and I like the tunnels too. However, it does seem like a connection between Bergen-Oslo-Stockholm-Helsinki is pretty powerful as you can then draw tickets and connect to cities easily (whereas the cities in the Western part of the board along Norway is rarely connected to). The only reason I sold this game is because of storage issues; I don't think it's very important to own when I already own TtR USA, Asia, India and Switzerland (the last 4 coming in a smaller box than that of TtR NC). If you are often playing with 2-3 players, this is the TtR to get!

Tense---totally loving it! I wouldn't be surprised if this surpasses my love of the original US map.

I have a few players I play with who make this game all about ABSOLUTE MISERY and PAIN. The game becomes raw and hateful in a wonderful way. So much so that the last time we sat down to play---right before we start---I turn to them and say, "You all know that as much as I like you guys, I'm going to hate you in 45 seconds." Thirty seconds later: I want to punch Rob and Duncan in the face and kick them under the table.

Good times. 

The game makes me want to get on a train in Scandinavia and see all these cities. Really, I think it is a life goal of mine to give this a try now.

Bought this quickly after it came back in print. It's hard not to compare this to TTR: Switz given that both are tailored to 2-3 players. For me, Nordic Countries is the stronger map. 

Although I liked the concept of country-to-country tickets in TTR: Switz, in practice, they were too clunky. There was too much incentive to make a mad dash to both ends of the board and just dig for those tickets. Also, the swiss map had too many tunnels for my liking.

With Nordic countries, you've got a tense map, with a nice mix of tunnels, ferries, and that monster nine-car route. Throw in my Finnish heritage, and I can safely trade away the Swiss map.

We judge this by high standards because we love the original game so much.  We prefer the cleaner rules of regular Ticket to Ride, but this version is quite good as well.  (We've also played the Marklin version, and didn't like that one as much.)  We play 2-player which causes much more direct competition than the regular version.  Wildcards act very differently, so trying to make regular colored routes (in which you are not allowed to substitute a locomotive for a regular card) can be frustrating.  If the color you need doesn't come up (or is wasted by a new rule that requires flipping and immediately discarding 3 cards from the drawpile) you can be out of luck.  You don't go through the pile and get to reshuffle as quickly as in the original game, so you might want to pay a little more attention to which colors you think are still available when making your plans.  We like the color scheme and the snowy card art.  It was also very cool of Days of Wonder to include enough trains that you can use any of the 3 new colors to play the regular version if one of those happens to be your color of choice.

This is a quick, fun train game.  Easy to learn, easy setup and moves pretty fast.  Great for families and a night just with friends.  The winter theme is great.  Highly recommend this one.  I'd give this a bit higher rating if it could play with more than 3.  I bought this one on sale at my local gaming store and now I guess I'll have to get the other versions.

Ticket to Ride has been growing on me ever since my son got old enough to play by himself. This one provides a great option for 3 players, and is preferable to vanilla TtR for variety.

RATING: 6
In a sure sign of old age creep and mellowing out, I am no longer completely aghast at the idea of playing TtR. Of the variants that exist that I've played, Nordic is the most appealing to me. It keeps the simplistic game play that makes the series so accessible to casual players, but makes the routes tighter and the competition a bit fiercer on the board, which is normally a problem with this series at less than full scale.

Make no mistake, this is very, very light and is certainly not the type of game that I could replay repeatedly, but it is a tight(er) version of a very popular game and has the virtue of playing well at the 2-3 scale, which are the numbers which I am most interested in trotting this type of game out with. I also love the color palate on this one, lots of purples and blues really give this one a distinct look.

Another Ticket to Ride. This one is meant for smaller groups, which fits my needs perfectly. My girlfriend loves Ticket to Ride, and I got a copy of this for her last Christmas.

It takes a while to break in the game, as I am not that familiar with the 'Nordic Countries' so tracking routes can be difficult. There is a wonderful map aid on BGG that I recommend downloading. The game is a blast for 2 people, and it can get a little crowded with 3. There are a few simple strategies that can be applied to gain the upper hand, but the game as a whole fits perfect for our needs!

anniversary gift for the Mrs. (9-2-2008 = 15 yrs, gota get her something cold).

First play was very good.  The game board, cards and routes make for a tight game and route blocking is a key part of the game even when not done on purpose.
  I like this one a litter better than Swiss map, because there are less tunnels and the many ferries make for a nice change of pace.  If you play TTR with 2-3 people most of the time, and you like a little screw your neighbor, I think this is the TTR for you.

Przepięknie zilustrowane zimowe wydanie pociągów, które będzie idealne dla 2-3 graczy. Gra jest w pełni samodzielna i warto posiadać ją obok Europy/USA. Świetnie rozplanowane trasy na planszy i brak dworców (które mamy w Europie)  sprawiają, że negatywna interakcja jest tu jeszcze bardziej odczuwalna niż w podstawowych wersjach, która dla 2 lub 3 graczy jest po prostu zbyt obszerna. Tutaj mamy wyrównaną i wymagającą rozgrywkę, nowe kolory wagoników (które na upartego możemy wykorzystać do gry w np. w 6 graczy w innych wersjach gry - takie homerules).

Rating is moving up, this is a very good game.  Initial comments I heard suggested the nine-train, 27 point route would be a sure gamewinner.  After playing the game 6+ times I can say it is not.  I'm starting to become familiar with the cities and the main routes you need to have to build off to complete tickets.  In my most recent game I was able to complet 13 of 14 tickets and was within 10 points of lapping the third place player (that's right, almost 100 points ahead).  This was all due to ticket points.  I like the tight board, I like the flexibility of being able to play sets of 3 as a wild card on the ferries or sets of 4 as a wild card on the big route of 9 trains.  I suspect my rating will end up at a 9.

My favorite among the series when there are 2 others to play the game. The board is subject to getting congested quickly, but you always seem to have alternate, less optimal routes. The bottom of the board (around Copenhagen) is full of many short routes that don't deliver a lot of points and take a whole turn to lay down a one card connection. The top half of the board is wide open with long routes. Maybe you can even make it to Murmansk and score mega points. All in all this game has a lot of tension and I enjoy playing it.

To be perfectly honest, I thought I was "above" Ticket to Ride.  Gateway games are too just easy, too bland, and not as fun as their more complex brethren.

Then PhunkyMonkey had us play his 10th Anniversary Edition Ticket to Ride, and I was honestly surprised at how good of a time our group had--including me!  Sure, the game is simple, with very few things to do each turn, but it is in that simplicity where the enjoyment lies.  There is low stress when making decisions, yet the decisions you make are still important and have consequences.

Sometimes playing a game that is low stress and just fun is worth your time, too.  

I purchased Nordic Countries because I figured that I would be playing this most frequently with my wife in 2-player games.  Funny enough, I purchased it right around Christmas time, so the snowy theme was more than appropriate.

[15 Feb 2017] - 6.5 (4 plays)
A lighter game that's quick and does require some hand management. The tighter board is better than the original TTR for 2 players. The secret seems to be building hubs out that make getting route cards complete on the draw instead of working on them.


[19 June 2017] - 6.75 (10 plays)
Wrapped up the 10 plays of this game for the 10x10 challenge and decided to give the game a slight bump. The rules are fairly light, light enough for non-gamers to pick up the game and be competitive. The tighter map, additions of tunnels and ferries as well as the special 9-link route do provide some challenges as well. Production value is excellent and the Nordic theming is colorful. A good game to own and one that has earned a space in my collection for school nights and use without hardcore gamers.

I suppose the big draw for this game compared with the standard [i]Ticket To Ride[/i] is that it's a 3 player game, with a smaller map. That in turn shortens the playing time, which is nice. There are tunnels, and there's a difference in the way the locomotives work, too.

It's all nice and fun, but after two games I worry that the 9-space route in that game is going to be too crucial. You'll either have to go out of your way to block someone, or risk someone else getting both the route and completing a big ticket. In the former case you risk royally pissing someone off (not really fun), in the latter you almost certainly lose (also not fun).

I haven't tried the Switzerland variant yet, so maybe that's the way to go if you're looking for a 3 player variant.

[Edit: So far I have won every single game of this I've played by claiming the 9-space route, so down the rating goes.]

Seriously, I don't hate it, but it is more cutthroat than any of the others so far.  Not that that is a bad thing.  The problem is that TtR is the one game that my wife regularly beats me in.  And when I say regularly, I mean it.  No matter what version, I think I can count my wins against her on 2 hands and still have fingers left over!  so now, we have an even tougher version.  We tried it out for the first time and played 3 games.  She completely and thoroughly trounced me - so badly that I conceded game #2 halfway through after she had blocked me out of 2 of my first 4 contracts.  God help me!

An okay variant.   With lots of 1, 2 and 3-car routes, it seems like whoever scores the 9-car route should win the game by rushing.   Better than Switzerland but all the little bells and whistles with the ferrys and wilds don't really add anything.  TTR seems to be better when distilled down its essence (1910) rather than dressed up.  Less is more.

This is a solid 3-player map.  I like the way it has the advanced route types from Europe, and the way it changes up how you use wilds.  Some of the exceptions are a little strange, though (the way you can substitute sets of cards for wilds on ferries, and in the giant Murmansk route).  It's a lopsided kind of map, since all the major cities are in the south, and then a smaller number of longer routes lead north.

Beautiful board and card art. Much tighter than Switzerland -- there's no big ticket grab and you can be easily blocked out. Works well with two but shines with three. Ultimately though, like all TtR games, sooner or later you find yourself sitting there trying to draw the right card(s). Still, a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

likely for only the most hard core TtR players... very tight map, but high luck count with limited routes/space & tunnels. outcome may be greatly influenced by whomever gets the right card at the right time. Not sure if you can play casually either due to the great competition for the routes.

We bought TTR Nordic after reading reviews which said it works well with 2 players.  We weren't disappointed.  We really like this map and find it lends itself to some gripping tussles.  My little girl is getting the hang if now and really likes the purple trains and the snow covered cards.

(11 year old daughter rating - 8)

Best with 3.

The first and foremost thing I have to say is that I'm glad it's primarily a 2 - 3 player game because that's what I usually have in terms of number of players.  Mechanically I like that it shares a lot of it's game play with Europe which I consider to be far better than the original TTR.

I like this two player version of the game. Very tense game, not for begginers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very interesting game - it is our 1st and ONLY TTR experience.  2-player is super cutthroat and fun.  3-player is a bit easier but more tense as there is more chance for blocking.  Solid game with 2 strategies going on:  connecting cities for completing destination tickets, and completing routes for maximizing points.  More brain work than Carcassonne!!  Mystery Bob ONLY wants to play this!!  I probably will grow tired of it soon!

Update:  It's tiring as Mystery Bob plays aggressively and is a risk-taker with the Destination Tickets, which forces me to play the same way instead of doing my own thing.  Rating lowered from 7.35.

Update:  Played 3-player with my daughter finally coming into her own and preparing/executing a good strategy.  She came in 2nd place beating my husband.  I wouldn't mind playing it this way from time to time!!

Increase rating to 6

Update: Played 3-player but this time my daughter hoarded all the cards to make the 27-point connection.  I really can't stand when she plays that way because she really stalls the game's progress.  Plus, she has too many cards to hold and stacks them face down and doesn't even know what she has.  She didn't complete any destination tickets as she started too late on them.  Mystery Bob completed 13 destination tickets and ran away with it.  Not enjoyable when all players are not playing the same way.

Rating stays at 6

Taught it to nongamers and they LOVED it a lot.  I still find it OK but tiring and too long for what it is.  It is also a pain to supervise the new players CONSTANTLY that can't seem to remember the VERY FEW rules to this game.  SIGH........ Still a 6.

Excellent.  Plays 2 or 3 players, and there's lots of overlap between tickets, so lots of competition for routes.  Encourages you to choose more tickets.  Probably better with 3, but still good with 2!

RATING: 8
The map for Nordic Countries is a bit more unusual than the other maps that I've played on for Ticket to Ride U.S. and Europe. It can make it much more rewarding and potentially frustrating to play on. For those who find the U.S. board too easy, and want to try a variation more like the European board, this can be a worthy acquisition. Note that the Nordic version only is 2-3 peoples instead of 2-5, in part cause of how weird the board would be for more than 3. Amusingly though, the box insert for the pieces is the same as standard Ticket to ride, with space for 5 players worth of pieces. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very nice variation of the basegame. I especially like the winter-artwork and the idea of the tunnels and ferries that make for some interesting decisions. And the relatively small map guarantees tense action between the players from the first round on (building your routes east-west seems to be a lot less stressful and less critical than the north-south routes).

Easy to learn nice game for 3 players.
You often have many multiple plans simultaniously and have to plan ahead all the time.
For two players the board is too big, but for three it is very nicely balanced.
I don't like biggest route made in game though, it just spoils the game a little bit.

Pretty interesting euro game. In this one you can screw up your opponents pretty badly (it is a plus in my book - games should be focused on player interaction). It is one of those titles that can be infinitely replayable, and probably next games will get better and better. It is still eurolame, but at least this one can be fun to play.

[b]Rating based on - 1 play, 2 player[/b]
Pretty much the same Ticket to Ride, but only for 2-3 players and set in the snowy northern territories of the world – the Nordic Countries. In this iteration you can only use locomotive cards on tunnel and ferry routes and not as wild cards to complete normal routes. It was OK. Since we play mostly 2 players, and I also love winter themed games, I thought it would be good to try it out but it didn't feel particularly interesting and I thought the map was way too sparse. It felt like I would get tired of it quite quickly because there are not that many routes so there is a lot less variability than with the bigger maps. To make up for the paucity of tracks you'd think that there would be scope for some great illustrations, but the artwork was barely there and seemed like an afterthought. In addition, I have no ties to the Nordic Countries so wasn't that interested in playing this one versus the other maps we definitely [b]are[/b] interested in. I leave the unpronounceable names to someone else, but I keep the cool cards and the purple trains!

This is by-far my favorite version of Ticket to Ride.

* It has beautiful art
* It has [b]PURPLE[/b] trains! :zombie:

Though I've given it a 7/10, I feel this is quite generous. I've at least enjoyed this game that much every time I play, but I need to be with a very particular group and in a particular mood to even want to get it to the table.

In all other Ticket To Ride games, you may avoid to be mean to other players. In this game, the routes are so few that it's really hard to avoid it. I like the tension in this version. The ferries and tunnels also makes the game interesting.

I get why this is "better" for 2-3 players than Ticket to Ride. But this is not a great version to teach new people. "So you can use jokers here and here but not there. And they are only really JOKERS for here, but NOT here. And they can be used on this ONE long route, but they don't count as jokers at all, and you need four cards for every missing card in your set. But over here you need THREE cards for every missing joker."

Seriously? So gone is the rule elegance. So unless you think Ticket to Ride is the greatest game ever, why would you buy this finicky version?

Well, you wouldn't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Since this version of Ticket to Ride plays only 2-3 players I thought it would be better suited to 2 players than the others that play 2-5.  However with only two players the game felt too open, with not enough competition.  We never once were able to cut the other off with any significance.

It is a beautiful game, and still a useful gateway game even if there are only 2 players.  Since I have other Ticket to Rides, I could do without this one.

Excellent game.  Glad, though, that I watched two games of "Ticket to Ride" (USA map) two weeks before trying to play this today.  I also had an excellent teacher/coach (Ray) on my first game and figured that being 3rd of 3 players in my second game wasn't too bad (I had about 140-145 points vs. the winner (Ray) who had about 180-185 points).  Looking forward to playing the other TtR games.  Another fun game of it, this time at Dragonflight Con.  Will have to dust off my copy of it and play mine again someday.

I love this game. We've owned this for over two years now and it still is chosen regularly and always loved.

The outcome is always different. Do you go for lots of short routes down near Oslo, or do you strike out North and risk getting blocked? Do you try and get across to Bergen - it's a tricky tunnel? 

The winner in our house, and the margin of defeat, is always changing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a good variant of TtR. I like the small map and it's the obvious choice for TtR with 3 players. The unique mechanics in this game are very subtle, allowing a locomotive symbol to be substituted by 3 cards and replacing the longest route with most tickets. Both of these help balance the luck of the draw, I especially enjoy the 3 card rule. I usually find TtR a bit stressful and aggravating, spending turn after turn trying to find just one specific card and never finding it before an opponent steals the route you were going for. This game alleviates this a bit, but not enough for me to love it.

TtR is unique in the way it frustrate me. In a less luck-dependent euro game if an opponents blocks me, I can admit that they outplayed me and it adds tension without being frustrating. In TtR whenever anyone blocks me, regardless if they've clearly been playing better than me and planned it in advance, I still blame luck for not getting me the cards I needed 1 turn earlier. I recognise that luck isn't a huge factor in TtR and that the better player usually wins, but it just doesn't feel that way when playing.

I have played and enjoyed two- and three-player games of the original [gameid=9209] and [thing=14996]TtR: Europe[/thing], but neither comes close to the experience that [thing=31627]Nordic[/thing] offers for small groups.

[gameid=31627] is far more intense, more vicious, and more entertaining than 2-3 player [gameid=9209].

An easier version than Marklin.  The tunnels and ferries are fun.  Found it hard that you can't use locomotives for normal routes though.  Good variant of the Ticket to Ride franchise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
If you want to play Ticket to Ride with two players, look no further! Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries is specially designed for two or three players, with fewer connections and lean north-south corridors. Ferries and tunnels make a return to the series, but they're implemented better here than they were in Ticket to Ride: Europe, because of the changes to the wild cards. The wild locomotive cards can be drawn at the same rate as regular trains, but they can only be used toward ferries and tunnels (and a single 9-length connection). Ferries are very important in this map, and their requirements have been relaxed so that you can play either one locomotive or two regular trains for each ferry space. The new board and the rules changes combine to create a tense nip-and-tuck experience for two or three players.

This version of Ticket to Ride is absolutely gorgeous. The color palette is mostly shades of lilac, violet, and pale blue, with lots of white and alabaster. It looks great. There is a satisfying sense of visual harmony among the board, the train colors (blue-violet, white, black), and the snow-covered train cards.

I eventually traded away TtR:Europe and TtR:Märklin, but TtR:Nordic countries has earned a permanent place on my shelf next to the original Ticket to Ride + the 1910 expansion.

I find this a fine addition of the series. The map is nice with some choke points and it tighter than any other maps. Therefore you will see track building sooner in this game which I find a good thing. I don’t know if the game need it, but it is slightly more complicated than the US map.

Played once. Actually only played this pass and play on the iPad. I have played enough of the various physical versions of Ticket to Ride to feel I know what the experience would be like so I am taking the liberty of commenting based on this digital playing. Simple, back to basics map and rules set though the inconsistent use of 4 cards as a joker just for one route is a bit of a fiddle. Sweet to have pictures of train carrages covered in snow but really this is just more of the same. An okay version of an excellent game. July 2016

My introduction to the TTR series.  I like that it plays fairly quickly and doesn't have much down time.  I've played Europe and USA online, and I like NC's smaller map compared to those.  With a maximum of 3 players and the smaller map, it is much easier for me to keep track of what my opponents are doing and whether or not it would be more beneficial for me to spend a turn blocking them.

RATING: 8
Nice 3 player map. I think I prefer this one to Switzerland.

After more plays, this is definitely the best 3 player map. The interaction level is pretty good with a lot of re-routing needed to adapt to other player's actions. The 9 step route gives an interesting bit of end game strategy that isn't really present in another TTR and increases the value of hording a color to mess with other players.

Fjordok, alagutak, kompok és Murmanszk
Az alapjátékot kibővítő táblák közül ez a téli hangulatban tervezett menetjegyeivel és vagonkártyáival, lila-fehér-fekete vonatokkal és különleges szabályaival igyekszik belopni magát az emberek szívébe.
A tábla nagyon szépre sikeredett, élmény rajta kis vagonjainkat lerakosgatni és dicséret illeti a takaros havas kártyákat is.
A játék célja változatlan, azonban több finomságot is tapasztalhatunk. Elsődleges, hogy ez a tábla kifejezetten 2-3 fős játékra került megtervezésre (a dupla útvonalakat 3 játékos esetében lehet 2 személynek elfoglalnia). A megszokott 45 vonat helyett 40-et kap minden játékos, ami mutatja, hogy itt rövidebb lesz a játékidő.
A tábla kialakítása kifejezetten versengőre sikeredett, egy-egy vasútvonalért ádáz küzdelem is kialakulhat. Ez valakinek tetszeni fog, de az „érzékenyebb lelkűeknek” inkább az Európa verzió ajánlott.
A játék végi bónusz 10 pont a legtöbb menetvonalat teljesítő játékos(ok)nak jár, így célunk minél több kiépítése.
Az Európa verzióból megismert alagutak és kompok itt is megjelennek. A mozdony kártyák azonban csak ezek esetében számítanak dzsókernek, hagyományos vonalakon már nem. Cserébe egy-egy mozdony megszerzése után még elvehetsz egy kártyát a kikészített 5 lap közül vagy a húzópakli tetejéről. Újdonság, hogy kompok esetében a mozdonykártyát bármilyen – jól érted, bármilyen – 3 lap eldobásával kiválthatod.
A táblán megjelenik az eddig leghosszabb útvonal szürke színben „pompázva”, a Murmanszkba vezető 9 hosszú és 27 pontot érő „monstrum”. Mivel egy színből elég nehéz ennyit összeszedni, így extraként bármelyik 4 kártya felhasználható, mint a szükséges szín egy lapja.
Összességében vizuálisan remek változat versengő játékosok részére. Két fős játékhoz kifejezetten ez ajánlott.

RATING: 8
Perfect Ticket to Ride map for 2-3 players. If you never have more than that, there is no reason to mess with any of the others. It still gets some play in our group, but generally we have moved on to other games. I am not sure that is a strike against this game as much as it is a testament to some of the other games available right now. It is great if you want something light, have a newbie, or a youngster. It is also good if you just want a light game that is not a brain burner. For what it is, there are few games that are better. If you usually play with larger groups, get the base game (US or Europe), for smaller groups get this one. We always have 2 or 3 and the base US game almost never hits the table anymore.

A great addition to the Ticket to Ride series.  It is nice to have a game that is playable with fewer players (I contend USA and others really cannot be played with only 2, there is almost no interaction which to me is key to the game being fun).

There are a few passages that you need to make or you are going to have a long game, which makes it cutthroat and fun.  Also I do not see why you have to limit it to 3 players, take trains from your other box and play with more, it gets mean!

This also gives new colors so you can play the original with more, I would just take out 5 trains per person added.

[Initial Impression: 4]
Have only played with 2 players so far. I like the other entries in the Ticket to Ride franchise, but something about this one just hasn't clicked for me. The long routes seem overly risky, the map is unbalanced (getting stuck with left-sided routes seems disastrous), and luck seems even more prone to influence the outcome (droughts of one color train card with no ability to compensate through wilds). Some people seem to adapt well to these aspects and play skillfully, but so far this one just frustrates me to no end.
EDIT: The game seems to be much more balanced with 3 players, as the increased competition on the right side of the board makes it less deadly to work on the left, and the cards get cycled more quickly. Rates as a 7 with three players, as a 4 with two - I'd pick the original map or even Europe over this one as a two-player.

More interesting than basic Ticket to Ride with the ferry and tunnel mechanics.  However, the basic principle remains mostly the same.  Getting rid of the wilds helps a lot in keeping it closer to balance rather than luck.  The map feels pretty good for two, though I would have liked to see a wider spread of ferries.  The northern part of the board is very saturated compared to the east.  I guess the east gets balanced out by the new 9-train route.

I really like Scandinavian culture, so I like learning names and locations of cities.  It's certainly more interesting than playing the base map and knowing everything.  I'd be very interested to try this with three, as I imagine the map gets a lot tighter.

This Nordic version isn't enough of an improvement to really warrant a higher rating.  It's still a TTR game, it's still solid and fun to play, but some luck issues remain and it's not going to fill up a meaty game desire.

(02/25/09) Excellent version of TTR for three players. The map and cities is somewhat disorienting, but what a way to learn the geography of the Nordic countries. Just the right amount of crowdedness and flexibility, for tense, fast-paced fun. Initial rating: "8".

(03/29/13) Update: Finally got my own copy--found that the cities are not in English, but in their native spelling! Great, tight, short version of TTR.

I enjoy all of the TTR games with enough people, but what holds me back from loving them is the terrible luck with drawing the trains.  I know it's evenly distributed amongst everyone, but there's nothing worse than spending countless turns not drawing the one card you need and then the game ending and a high point route that's one connection away ruins your entire game.  I feel that more times than not, whoever loses this game experiences that exact feeling.

A very good TtR map for 3, although the rules for jokers do create a lot of finickiness.  You can house rule down to the simpler USA and Europe rules however and the game still seems to work. Includes tunnels but not stations, so incorporates the best features of TtR:Europe.

I really didn't like the increased importance of the locomotive tickets.  I found that at a certain point of the game, all I could do was sit there forever and wait for locomotives to come up--and they had to come up randomly because there's no way they wouldn't be taken if they showed in the display. 

The board is very pretty, though. And my friend's city is on it (Norrkoping)!

My wife and I have all the TTR games, and this is our favorite. As it's only 2-3, you can't play with other couples (or if you have more than 3 family members). That being said, it's extremely well balanced, and the artwork is fantastic. 

It does dramatically change the way wildcards(locomotives) can be used. There's also a 9 train route with some odd/special rules involved. It may take a couple references to the rulebook to learn the new rules, but it still has the light gameplay of other TTR games.

A wonderful family game with beautiful Scandinavia and its specific climax of tunnels, ferries and esoteric routes (Murmansk).

Take a ticket to ride and reach the North Cape with a great style, not forgetting to build some economy around Nordic capital cities.

Really great scaled-down version of TtR which is great if you usually play with your SO or something.  Game isn't as cutthroat as some other maps, and it is slightly more forgiving in that there are rules that allow you to play 2 of one card as another, for example.  Perhaps not the most competitive version of TtR you can buy, but it's a very good one.

The enhanced design and addition of tunnels and ferries make this one a tad more complex than the base TTR. I like to go for tons of destination tickets, which adds excitement as the game end approaches. Great with 3 players but still fun with 2. If I had to keep only one version of TTR this would be it.

RATING: 10
Purchased halfheartedly since own original TTR, and wondered how many TTR's does one need?  But the smaller board size, the better use of the locomotive/wild cards makes this a tenser, quicker, funner game to me.  My 2 girls just about BEG for this game and they said it was a 10 to them.  Dang, now I wonder if I need the other TTR's.

Excellent for two player.  Confined and tense, easy to get scuppered by your opponent, and less like the other versions this game seems to encourage blocking your opponent making it the most interactive T2T version I've played.  Highly recommend as a 2-player game (as well as 3).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
In my opinion, this is the best map for a two-player game. The map is tight and you are sure to get blocked and it'll be impossible to finish some of your tickets. This keeps the game challenging and won't feel like your playing by yourself like in USA or Europe if played two-player.

really tight TTR map, with plenty of new mechanics.  Plays very quickly.

comes with regular sized cards, and trains, 2 of which are new colors, so you can potentially combine this with a larger map and make house rules for more than 5 players.

The downside is that the destinations are pretty much all places I have never heard of, making them hard to pronounce, and the destination cards are printed oddly, with some of them going right to left and bottom to top, making it tricky to actually find the destinations on the map if you aren't aware of this design flaw.

The game left me totally indifferent.  And that says TtR (Europe and Marklin) lover...  Maybe I'm not a TtR lover any more... or can it be that Nordic Countries is just bland?  Without playing more (either Europe/Marklin or Nordic Countries) I cannot tell.

Anyway, the map seems oriented at heavy ticket drawing (good) and possibly large dose of negative interaction (though, I experienced small amount of the latter in my only 3-player game).

RATING: 5
I don't really understand the attraction of these games.  I find it sort of vaguely amusing to draw my cards and try to fill in the routes between cities to score points, especially the ones that I have drawn bonus point cards for.  There is some amount of maneuvering for routes between players and some thinking about what color cards to aim for but mostly it's pretty automatic play.  So I don't hate to play but it feels kind of like junk food, oddly not filling.

Nordic Countries is an excellent variant on Ticket to Ride for smaller groups that doesn't change too much from the original game. That said, I prefer Switzerland for the same player count just because of how interesting the changes to the gameplay are.

Rated after a single 2 player.  I prefer this game over Switzerland as a two-player game.  The map is small enough that there will be interaction even if the players are not actively seeking it.  The wildcard rules give you an outlet for the extra cards drawn during the game and the 9-train route is a tempting target. 2nd game and despite my wife getting the 9-train route I could have won the game - except I missed a single connection I swear I had. :-(

The graphic design gets better and better with the TTR games.  At least unlike the card game, the art is painted on top of a fundamentally solid game.  For the most part the same old TTR, but with snow.  Pleasant and innocuous, a good game to have a conversation over.  I probably don't notice the cutthroat nature of this title because I've long since stopped caring whether I win at Ticket to Ride.

Well, it's TTR for 2-3 which is nice.  The tunnel and ferry rules are new from the USA version, it's weird having no idea of the geography of the region which makes the board more difficult to use, but I'm sure that'll pass with more plays.  Overall a good game with well written rules.

RATING: 9
I've only played this version and the USA map, so I don't have the full TtR experience (Europe, Marklin, Switzerland, Asia) to compare it with.  I play games mostly with my wife, so a board designed for two or three is great for us.  It might be worth having Nordic Countries AND USA/Europe, just because some might not like the potential gridlock that a three-player game might present.

I love the simplicity of TtR.  I'll never be able to play TransAmerica or TransEuropa (even with vexation) after playing Ttr.  Alan Moon created a game that gives you moderate depth and strategy from only three actions (pick cards, lay trains, take destination cards).

I love how the south and east of the board (which is beautiful, by the way) are really crowded and tense.  Tunnels tend to prevent people from using the west part of the board.

Always in the mood for this game.

RATING: 4
Decent 2 player game. I like this version just slightly better than the Europe version (mainly because I mostly play 2 player).

I am coming to realize that I will likely never request to play Ticket to Ride, and so I'll be trading/selling this version. I'll keep Europe for when I have a larger group of newbies looking to play something.

Ticket To Ride goes to Scandinavia and adds in locomotive-required routes and a 9-train route, but it's 3 players only for a reason. And if you have 2 players working either side of the board, there's no real strategy against each other.

MINUS: too easy to stay on separate sides of the board

RATING: 8
Ticket to Ride and Zooloretto are my preferred gateway games. I like them both, but I certainly wouldn't play vanilla Ticket to Ride with my fellow gamers. I score the game a 7 because I feel that player choices are too limited to score any higher, although I do think it makes brilliant use of the rummy mechanic.

Enter Nordic Countries, basically TtR: Europe for 2-3 players. It has both tunnel and ferry routes. Tunnel routes add a bit of risk in that you are not entirely sure how many cards you will need to complete the route and ferries require the use of locomotives, or 3 cards in the place of a locomotive. This causes you to weigh the risk/reward of choosing certain routes over others more so than in the vanilla game. It also adds a 9 train connection worth 27 points, but completing it is risky as it eats up a lot of your trains for completing tickets and does not deliver multi-use points as many other routes will. There are a number of good choke points on the map. I feel that this is the fullest realization of the game's potential. A game, in fact, I'd be happy to play with my gamer cohorts!

I haven't played TtR: Europe yet, only read the rules, but I'd imagine I'd give both games the same score and pick one to play based on number of players.

Right now, probably my favorite of the TTR games.  Rated over Switzerland mainly because its a self-contained game, like the focus on routes instead of longest train.  However, it can't hold more than three, and it's relatively easy to get blocked.  Rating may drop to a 6, therefore, after more plays.

Great map. I think three is probably the ideal number for TTR, so having such a beautifully produced version tailored to that number is great. Love the rules for tunnels and ferries. [b][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/339681]See my comparison to Switzerland[/b][/url]

Update: I've downgraded my rating to a seven. That's a reflection of my interest in the Ticket to Ride system. Nordic Countries is still the best example of that system. Ultimately I find TtR fragile - people play by the unspoken average level of aggression at the table.

Ticket to Ride for two or three players. Better than Ticket to Ride: Switzerland which was the only map specifically designed for low player numbers that I've played before and that suffered from weird destination cards. It takes a bit to get used to the special rules for locomotives that only can be used for tunnels and ferries. Other than that, it's the usual TTR goodness on a tight map.
Two minor worries: the huge 9-wagon route in northern Finland seems too strong and some areas like Denmark don't seem feasible to build in due to lots of 1- and 2-wagon segments.

Get ready to file your destination tickets and complete your cargo routes.  Try to complete as many routes as possible for maximum points, while also claiming vital routes to key destinations so that your opponents have difficulty completing their routes.  This is a fun game full of strategy, card pulling and luck.  The game takes from 35-60 minutes to complete.  I have only played it with 2 players and it is great, but I am sure a 3rd player would also be extremely fun.  I love this game.

RATING: 7
A nice addition to the series.  Certainly not essential, but fun.  The art on the train cards is nice, and the map is very interesting, with the potential for some really aggressive play.  Being only for 2 - 3 players, waiting for the right color card can be really annoying if someone else is collecting the same color as you.

The map itself is both the draw and an annoyance.  Not knowing anything about the geography of Scandinavia, figuring out where the cities are on your ticket is difficult, though I guess it adds an extra educational element to the game.  An observant opponent could definitely figure out where you were going if they wanted to, but they're probably just as busy trying to figure out their own tickets to notice.

Basic TtR fun, maybe a bit more fast-paced. Nothing overly spectacular, but still pleasant to play. With two players simple blocking is way too easy, especially in the mid-northern part of the map. I like it more with three. Other than that, I also think that the map has been constructed a bit oddly. St. Petersburg would have been nice to see as well as more of the Baltic region. Finland is chock full of comical one or two length routes which makes it almost impossible to block any moves there as each city is connected to every other one. You might also want to stay away from Norway, those endless tunnels and ferry routes might make building a bit complicated and may turn the whole Norway into a long death trap.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This might be the best of the series so far. It is balanced well for 3 players (I have yet to play it with 2). It has lots of interesting decisions thanks to the asymmetrical nature of the board and tickets as well as the increased need to collect specific colours for routes as locomotives can no longer be used as wild cards. As a result it might make sense to take additional tickets early in the game when the specific colours you are looking for are not available among the face-up cards. The value of random draws is decreased which makes for a better game than the original two versions (TTR and TTRE). Marklin is still my favourite due to its five player maximum but Scandinavia is also worth having on the shelf for even a small collection.

I've played all of the editions of Ticket to Ride, and Nordic Countries is by far my favorite with over 100 plays. Whether with 2 or 3 players, the rules of Nordic are the most refined of the series. There are multiple effective strategies and the game rewards branching out to key locations in hopes of future "free" routes. The left side of the board, with its continuous tunnels may be a little too difficult, but overall the board design is a work of art. Easy 10/10.

RATING: 6
Wow, what a disappointment after all the acclaim on BGG.  I'm glad I didn't buy this one before I tried it.  Maybe it seems cut-throat to people who are used to playing with the stations from TtR:Europe, but I would much rather play the big cities 1910 variant with 3 players on the USA map than this gorgeous but ultimately uninteresting map.  Definitely attempt to try this one before going out and spending money on it because its OOP.

Wonderful variant on the TTR theme. Excellent production value & game play. As advertised, works very well with two players, markedly more so than TTR:Europe, mostly from the added tension of "real" blocking made possible by the lack of stations, and the map layout.  The re-invented train cards work better than I thought.

This version of Ticket to Ride has a lot of contention. It's cut throat esp. when one player starts taking up all the one train spaces, which happen to connect to the other half of the map rather conveniently.

This version of Ticket to Ride is only for two and three players. I enjoy the other games with two and three players but it’s great to have a tighter map designed specifically for these numbers. The game uses ferries and tunnel routes introduced in the Europe version but it adds a new twist, wild cards can only be used on ferry and tunnel routes. This definitely changes the feel of the game as planning ahead and leaving yourself as many options as possible is more important than ever (since wild cards can no longer get you out of some situations).

I’d definitely recommend this version for anyone who likes Ticket to Ride and is likely to play much with 2 or 3 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice tight board for 3-players. Would even consider it with 4. Can be cutthroat depending on gaming style so longer routes can be risky. It does have some unique train rules (ex. locomotives can be selected just like any other card but cannot be used on “normal” track) but once explained it is relatively easy to keep them straight.

This is a nice Ticket to Ride version for two or three players. In the standard version (Ticket to Ride: Europe) you don't clash at all when playing with two players, because of the large map. Both players just go their seperate ways. Here in Nordic Countries, you can (strategically) claim routes right before your opponents nose. Both players are more depedent on the same routes. Altogether, a very good game.

Nordic seems a bit tired compared to the other Ticket to Ride games I've played, as if the designer ran out of ideas. Manages to still have some of the charm of the original (and Märklin, the best version). I probably should play more before commenting the map, but seems that things can get quite cut throat with plenty of easy to block short routes.

We played 15-20 games in the first 3 days of owning this. Everything just clicks: gameplay is easy to learn and intuitive, artwork is beautiful, strategic enough to give you a challenge, with a side of luck so you feel like you're taking a chance. Games last about 1 hour, so it's not even that long. Perfect game.

If I'm ever playing Ticket to Ride with 2 players, I play this board. It was designed exclusively for 2 or 3 players and is very, very tight. You will most-likely get frustrated with the person you're playing with as connecting any two cities probably messes up your plan, but it is very relieving when you adjust to the board and finish your destination, anyway

It's more challenging to play than the base game, which complements its game length in a way that is more satisfying. Capping the player count to 3 also ensures that the game won't run too long.

The tunnels and ferries take a little bit of getting used to, and the rules exceptions for building them seem  arbitrary, but this re-implementation is quite fun.

A very hard map to rate because it doesn't scale properly. Which is unfortunate as it's only for 2 or 3 players. If you have 3 players, the board is tight and you will be fighting for routes, which is fun. If you have 2 players, there's one choke point and basically the rest of the board is wide open, leading to two people mostly playing solitaire. If people aren't forcing each other to alter their strategies, then I ain't that interested.

I played this as a prototype (Scandinavia) with three players and it seemed an excellent addition the the T2R line.  It mixes in some variations/rules twists that makes it feel different from the other games.  The tension is a bit similar with T2R Switzerland but has some subtle differences that I enjoy both.

RATING: 7
Solid entry into the TTR series for 3 players.  Be aware of the changes - no points for longest chain of trains but 10 points for most tickets completed.  Locos are not wild per se - they can only be used as wilds in routes requiring a loco.  A couple other changes exist as well.  Pricey!

A very tight, almost vicious version of Ticket to Ride for 2-3 people. It plays like there are six players on the original USA map - that is how tight it is. Be prepared for swearing as other players take the routes you were counting on!

Knocked down a point for the weird rule exceptions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For us, it's definitely a better game than Switzerland. It solves the relentless ticket drawing problem and is a much tighter map with fewer annoying one train routes. However, the new wild card rules that are different for different routes feel fiddly, especially for a Ticket to Ride game. Also, the map is almost too tight---once one person can get their north-south axis established, they usually run away with a big win so the games tend not to be close.  It usually becomes a battle to complete those routes and cut the other player off.  I think the Globetrotter bonus for most completed tickets is supposed to help compensate, since the other player can concentrate on completing more smaller tickets, but the 10 point bonus just isn't enough. 

It's a good game, but I think we find Europe with the 1912 Big Cities expansion to be our favorite two player version---just tight enough to be competitive but just loose enough to not be cut-throat.

Plays on a 2-3 player map and brings in tunnels and ferries.  It is a very difficult map and you are very likely to get cutoff on this map.  It is a "mean" map.

RATING: 9
A wonderful new map, and very cute with its winter/christmas theming. Best thing about the board is it is optimized for 2-3 players, meaning that with fewer players there WILL be direct confrontation and scrambling to get the right routes, whereas 2 players in America or Europe is kind of like playing solitaire and there is little competition. A perfect balance for when there are less than 4 players.

After one play, I can say that for two-players this is more enjoyable than the other games in the TTR series.  Being less open, the decisions on when and where to place a route are much more interesting and sometimes tense.  There are a few double-routes between cities, but these are only used for 3-players games.

My rating for the TTR series has been a 6, but I'd say almost a 7 when played with more players (4 or more) due to the added conflict of others taking routes you need (and vice versa).  This one's smaller map has the same effect with fewer players, so I am increasing the rating for this one in the TTR series.

Also, a thumbs-up for keeping the push-your-luck tunnel routes and ferry runs from the TTR:Europe (and NOT keeping the sissy switch houses).

Preferred over switzerland and seems to be more cutthroat.
See: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/750093/your-guide-to-ticket-to-ride-ticket-to-ride-nordic

Smaller board makes it optimal for 2-3 players. Smaller board makes it less enjoyable for more players who might find it TOO cutthroat.
See:http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/925004/three-players-two-new-europe-or-nordic-or-asia
The following comment was posted there:
Nordic:
Pro: optimized for three players.
Con: easy to block other players (i.e. negative experience for a first play of TTR?)

Europe (with or without 1912 expansion):
Pro: lots of room i.e. not too much contention for routes (plus station if there is contention).
Con:...too much room (i.e. more boring)?

Legendary Asia:
Pro: mountains can mean a slightly shorter game.
Con: more enjoyable for the more experienced (i.e. save for later)?

Not the best version. It's very easy to be cut off from a 24-point ticket to say, Honningsvåg, and then you've lost.
The long route to Murmansk seems too valuable, and there are to many 1-routes.
And they somehow forgot Denmark.

I don't understand why they make all these '2-3 players only'-expansions. Particularly, since you still can't use all routes in the 2 player game.

Nordic Countries is a nice edition of Ticket To Ride that was made for 2-3 players, using the same nice ferry and tunnel mechanics also seen in Europe.

The wild cards in this version are very important and can be difficult to pick up. Played it only with 2 players and find it very enjoyable.

Pros
Designed for 2-3 players.
Nice map.

Cons
Tickets range from 3 - 28 points, so adding points at the end can be wildly unbalanced.
Having one route worth 27 points is a bit odd.

Added to my collection in September 2008. First played in December 2011.

It plays rather differently from TTR:USA which I have played previously. The locomotive cards are really important becuase so many routes are ferries which require one or more locomotive to claim. Tougher tahn TTR:USA.

Initial rating: 7. Only three games played two player so far but I enjoyed it.

Still need to get in a few more plays to decide where this falls in the ranks of TtR games. I still love this system. It's very easy to plunk down a TtR game and get started in minutes with new and old player's alike. The board and the cards are gorgeous (I love the snow on the trains). I like that they didn't add much from previous versions. The game has ferries and tunnels and that's about it...oh, other than the rule that allows unrestricted Locomotive collection. Overall, looks like it will be a new favorite for the family. My game group seems averse to the lightness of the TtR games...but who can blame them when there are so many good heavier games.

Favorite TTR board so far (I have USA, Europe, Switzerland, and this one).  Great for two or three--I like this better than TTR:Switzerland because it doesn't have an enormous number of tunnels, and it brings back ferries!

Also, it's the prettiest of the boards I mentioned.  (And the cards are great--snow-covered!)

This game is lovely. The winter landscape, snow-covered trains, holly accents, color scheme, and overall feel are Christmas-y, which is a large part of why I bought it. It's a Christmas game that's not a Christmas game.

I like the character of the map, with its cluster of tunnels and ferries in the west and slightly longer routes (plus the 27-point monster) in the east, and how well it works with two. Most tickets instead of longest route is a good change, and the ferries and tweaked locomotives are interesting. The variations from the basic game are few, which makes it easy to teach to people who know TtR.

Fantastic game.

RATING: 7
Unsure of this one.  4 games played, 3 3P, 1 2P.  Limited competitiveness.  One game a player won by over 40 points.  I think I vastly prefer TTR:E still.  The 2P was totally lopsided.

RATING: 8
This game only supports 2-3 players and, unlike other Ticket to Ride maps, feels quite squeezed. You can definitely step on another player's toes by accident, and even more so on purpose :) So I like the greater interaction, as well as the choice + push-your-luck aspect of routes.

Chance definitely has a higher role than I usually like, but if I'm selecting a game to be played with non-gamers (e.g. family), I've found this game and Wizard work the best as a balance between my likes and theirs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The first time I played this, I didn't like it. It was my wife and I, and we played the 2-player double route rule, which states that once one side of a double route is completed, the other side is closed off. In my opinion, that rule makes this map too tight, and cutthroat. I sold the game, re-bought it and played it again last night. Ignoring the aforementioned rule, I love the game. It's truly the best map for two. It's tight without being cutthroat. There's a race for the long route, for the most tickets and to get locomotives. I actually rate this higher than the vanilla version. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great Ticket to Ride re-theming. Takes a while to know where all the cities are, but the rule adjustments from the base game are well thought out and add new and exciting challenges that are not in the base game. Right on par with Ticket to Ride USA.

One of my all-time favorite games.
General TTR Comment: This is the ultimate modern boardgame. If you don't enjoy TTR then our tastes probably don't have much in common! TTR has very simple rules, lots of replayability, possibility of memorable games ("remember when I stole that huge road there"), beautiful components, chance to improve your skill and hint of luck to even it out for new players (and to add excitement). 1910 isn't necessary but it's certainly very recommended expansion if you plan to play a lot! This is simply PERFECT game that brings non-gamers and gamers together in unique way. Nordic Countries is the ultimate version for 2 and 3 (along with the again available Switzerland expansion map of course) players and has most beautiful components in series.

2-Player Comment:
* I love all Ticket to Ride maps as 2p, it's the game I play most often with my wife. Nordic Countries is my favorite map.

I also own Ticket to Ride: Europe, USA and Märklin versions.
Map expansions listed under TTR.

I love this game. I am a big Ticket to Ride fan, but this really is one of my favorites. I think the board is especially pretty and makes it feel like Christmas every time I break it out to play. The different track types add to the challenge of winning this game. Every time we play the point difference between first and second is so slim.

As for Eurpoe, this is a good entry level stratgey game that provides enough depth for experienced gamers, specifically for small number of players.
Players collect train cards that are used to claim train routes. Claimed routes cannot be used by other players and points are awarded for claiming routes and linking cities shown on their randomly assigned tickets.
An excellent introduction boardgame with reasonably simple rules. Adds speical rules for wildcards, tunnles and ferries that are not in the base game

RATING: 7.5
Take possession of color-coded railroads between cities by gaining and spending cards.

Easy game to understand, good for families.
Relies quite heavily on luck though, both with the destinations you get and the Wagon Cards you can pick.

The tunnels add another layer of luck but, strangely, I would say that the game benefits from it.
The ferries was an unnecessary addition.

The solitaire aspect of [geekurl=/boardgame/9209/ticket-ride]the original game[/geekurl] is less present in TTR: Nordic Countries, thanks to the much tighter map. Even before anyone has taken any route, you can feel the pressure of having to take it first, because your plans would really be complicated otherwise.

Definitely the TTR version to get for 3 players or less.

Love this game. 

It has a weirdly brutal feel to it. The route blocking can feel nasty and frustrating to the player getting the brunt of it. I love this kind of thing, and it introduces a lot of strategy and need for subterfuge. Great game but maybe not as a gateway game. 

Two drawbacks related to ergonomics:

1. I don't like having to manage and sort through a giant hand of cards, and this game makes you do that constantly.

2. the board (which is one of the best designed/illustrated boards I've ever seen) is really big, which means that we can't take it to pubs and restaurants to play like we like to do. 

This is one of those games that my brain just "gets". I almost never lose.

Have only played with 2.  With stations like TTR Europe (I use 1 1/8" ball-and-column pawns), this is tops for 2 players.

I like it with 3 players, but I fear for the the replayability: the south and east tickets are superior because of their abundance. Connect Stockholm, Copenhagen, Oslo and Helsinki and almost every ticket draw is a succes. The long north to south tickets are too risky and their is no back up plan. Because of this I start to see repeating paterns.

With 2 players blocking becomes too important and only the short tickets can be completed. The game becomes very destructive and that is fun once in a while but has nothing to do with the normal ticket to ride experience. And I think there are way better aggressive 2 player games.

Randomness: Medium - card draw.

Replayability: Very high, games are often played back-to-back.
Fun: The fun lies in the decision making of hand and board management.

Mivel leggyakrabban ketten ülünk le TtR-t játszani, ez kerül elő a legtöbbször (talán 1-2 kivétellel az összes TtR megvan). 2-3 főre optimalizált tábla, kellően kibalanszolt útvonalakkal, egyedül arra kell figyelni, hogy itt pl. a mozdonyok sima útvonalra egyáltalán nem használhatók, csak komphoz és alagúthoz.

2 játékos esetén számomra nem kérdés, hogy ez a legélvezhetőbb TtR. Egyedül a sok hasonló útvonalkártya zavaró, igazán lecserélhettek volna belőlük néhányat más városokra. Emiatt nem kap csak nagyobb pontszámot, mert egyébként kaphatott volna...

Saját rekord: 215 pont (17 útvonalkártyából mind teljesítve).

Yay! I finally picked this one up after it being out of print for a while.  I kept waiting for them to put it in an expansion box like the Switzerland map.  But I do like having more colored trains to play with.  You could technically play a 7 player game on the original map.  I'd like to try it once just for kicks.  Anyway...

After 1 play, this is a BRUTAL map and I LOVE it.  I was one train and 1 turn short of completing one ticket which made me lose more points in tickets then I gained.  Tight!  Can't wait to try again.

Giving the bonus 10 points to the player that completes the most destination tickets goes a long way toward balancing the low point destination tickets with the higher point destination tickets.  (At the same time, I miss attempting to build the longest train as the Europe edition requires.)

It's taken me a long time to try Nordic Countries but I liked what it had to offer. 

It is a more straight forward game than some of the expansion packs and its claim to fame is that the map is specifically designed to be for 2-3 players only. The board features ferries and locomotive only locations as well and their is a 9-long route that allows 4 of one colour to be played as a wild to add to other colours in your hand. 

What makes this a winner is the tightness of the map and the longest train bonus is done away with and the Globetrotter Bonus remaining to encourage players to go after more and more tickets. 

I also really liked the snow covered train cards. 

Will probably find its way into my collection this one.

Wow, I like this a lot more than the original TtR! I played the original TtR with five players and it was such a slog.. Limiting TtR to a maximum of three players, and designing it with that in mind, is such a great idea because it's an enjoyable basis for a game but in no way justifies the two hour play time that five players incurs.

Nordic Countries is also quite a bit more cut-throat than the original game which I love as it makes the game more interactive and makes my decisions feel much more meaningful.

Light, frothy and fun, if sometimes vicious for two.  A quick track building romp and you play the cards required to gather the routes to earn the points.  I did not care much for this at first, but it has grown on me, to the extent that I now look forward to playing it.  The simplicity of the rules (once the card substitutions have been understood) make this a great gateway game.

This version of the game is tense, without many tickets overlapping, but I wonder why some link in the creation chain insists on having each TtR map beyond the base game be balanced around new unnecessary rules. I'll stick with USA, which is already fine with a low player count.

In this 2-3 player game, there are ferries and tunnels. Ferries usually cost 1 or 2 locomotives, but any three cards can be used as a locomotive in a ferry. For normal routes, locomotives cannot be used. Locomotives can also be drawn normally like any other card. There is a 9 route link worth 27 pts, and a player can use four cards of any kind to fill in a space of that route. Finally, there is a most completed bonus of 10 pts. 

It feels like the most tactical of all the TTRs, with many choke points and opportunity to cut people off. It's very tense and engaging. It's one where you might have to study all the destination tickets to help you in the game.

Nice board.  Very unique board.  Need more plays.  may end up being more of a favorite than TtR:E.

The Game is just ruthless!  Best of the series.

TTR:NC has a nice underlying tension.  Locomotives are a necessity since they provide routes to destinations in the best way possible.  Being shortchanged on one can lead you to pick up cards relentlessly.

This is my only experience with the popular Ticket to Ride franchise.  Did not enjoy it.

I understand that its simplicity makes for an appealing gateway game but it can be so frustrating as routes get blocked and you have to entirely change your strategy while holding a fifteen card hand that you have because you were looking for that one card that would have scored major points to maybe keep you in the game.

For me a much better route connection game is Thurn and Taxis.

First impression (3 players): It's Ticket to Ride in good and bad. Has some rules changes from what I consider the norm but not much. Probably biggest change is that locomotives cannot be used on regular routes but only in tunnel/ferry routes. Rules in no way highlight these differences from what I was used to so at least I really would need to have a cheat sheet for those if this was my game. These small differences are hard to remember if you don't play game often.

RATING: 5
Yet another map for 2-3 players. Clearly the worst of the series; Has no originality at all, and is not any fun to play. Lots of very short tracks, and most destinations are very easy to block. OTOH, if you manage to build a single network with a few branches somewhere in the middle of the map, and not get blocked badly, you can just keep drawing more and more tickets with minimal risks. 

The color scheme is absolutely horrible.

A tight and unforgiving edition of Ticket to Ride for two or three players.

Probably should have been an expansion like Switzerland though.

An alternative 3-p version of TTR. Compared with the Switzerland map, we found it is slightly harder to guess which locations people were trying to connect. Early in the game there is a race to grab critical connections, and less emphasis on building a big hand of cards. It is comparatively safe and easy to draw more tickets, even with only a turn or so to go before the end. Slightly less challenge than Switzerland, but more attractive to look at. Maybe 1/2 a rating point lower.

Nice addition to the series.  This is can be a very crowded map, even for 2 players.  I like the dropping of the longest train bonus, as that would not work on this map.  The other alterations of the wild cards only for ferries and tunnels makes it tougher to get all your routes down.  Overall this is a well balanced game.  I like the large format cards that are standard on this version.  For a 2-3 player game and for the price you might want to look elsewhere if you already have any of the TtR series.  This is not a must-have except to complete the series.  But being restricted to 3 players max limits the times this will hit the table.

[b]Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]My thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My thoughts on TTR Nordic Countries will be focused on the two player experience. I've tried a bunch of the *other maps with two players, including Switzerland, and Nordic Countries is by far my favorite. The Switzerland map offers a great map for two players, but after a bunch of plays I didn't like how the routes connecting to other countries made the ticket draw so swingy. I also prefer the vertical layout of the Nordic Countries map with all of the choke points throughout the map, it is extremely easy to be cut off from a city making for a very tense game play experience. 

There is a good range of route lengths as well which allow you to plan out how you want to score points. I want to mention the 9 space route which is worth 27 points, while it seemed like that route could determine the winner it hasn't been the case in our plays so far. Partly because wilds can only be used for tunnel and ferry routes. All of these factors make TTR Nordic Countries my favorite map for two players and my second favorite map overall, the original TTR with the 1910 expansion is still my overall favorite.

*To date I've played TTR with the 1910 expansion, Team Asia, Legendary Asia, India, Switzerland and Pennsylvania.[/i]

Just as fun to play as TTR, TTREurope, and TTR Switzerland. The tickets are great, super variety! The use of locomotives is difficult as they are limited to just ferries and tunnels. And watch out in just a 2-player game you will most likely be heavily overlapping your opponents route! Because of this I think it plays just a little different than other TTRs! But in a 3-player game, I can say that the double routes seem to balance the game play as in other TTR games...not so confrontational as the 2-player game!

You'd get this for 2/3 player variety to Switzerland if you'd played the heck out of it. Just as solid as the others, with some slight variants on ferry routes (must have wilds) and the 9 long Murmansk route for whopper points. Where in Switzerland you travel along the diagonal spine and branch off, here the tickets are focussed in the south and the decision is whether to stay there and concentrate on tickets or to longhaul to the north. There seems more ways to get to places, so the route competition hasn't seemed as intense, making for a more friendly but less tense game.

Limited numbers means it'll see the table less but this is a fun board. Combining aspects of many of the previous releases provides for a bit of a rules muddle. I can see why the frequent need for engines drives the alternate options (3 of any card) poviding something to do with all those cards you collect. However the tickets seem to have a really good mix between smaller, complimentary ones and the bigger routes.

Not strictly recommended for any but completionists, but I also wouldn't say don't buy this, it's sufficiently different to warrant a place in your collection.

1/29/11 - This is one of my favorite games to play with my wife. The incidental blocking caused by this tight map can mess up your plans and send a player back to the ticket pile to find new routes to offset the loss of points. This is more competitive than the base US game.

Not much change here, mixes up some rules from the original and Europe while adding some minor changes such as the fact that there are no wild cards for regular tracks and the jokers can now only be used when building a tunnel or when indicated on the track. Also only plays 2 or 3. I much prefer the original and Märklin.

This version of TtR is only a little bit different from the others.  The main draw is the new map and, for some people, the purple pieces.  I think the addition of snow on the train cards is also a nice touch.  The game plays well with two or three players, and I find that the geography is foreign enough to most North Americans that everyone has to think a little harder than in original TtR or even TtR: Europe.

RATING: 8
I was never a big fan of the ticket to ride sytem. I enjoyed the base game, I thought TtR:Europe was an improvement and I thought TtR:Märcklin was too fiddly and artificially complex. But I always preferred playing with lower counts, because I always felt that such a simple system didn't support long playing times. 

However, TtR or TtR:Europe with just 2 or 3 players feel too forgiving. There's a lot of space in the map and blocking isn't really an option (I read somewhere that the 1910 expansion includes a good variant for lower player counts).

So, TtR:Nordic Countries seemed the perfect fit for me: it has the simple rules from previous incarnations but it's also a very mean and cutthroat game, with a lot of opportunity for blocking moves. 

I decided to try it, and after playing it a couple of times, I can heartily recommend it. It's got all the good stuff that made TtR such a successful franchise (rules simplicity, relatively fast playtime and interesting gameplay with a good learning curve to climb) and none of the other stuff that I didn't like in previous incarnations (downtime issues, long playing time with high player counts, or the fiddliness and unwarranted complexity that can be found in TtR:Märcklin). 

It's the best in the series IMHO and I'm glad that I've tried it.

Nordic Countries changes some fundamental aspects of how I play Ticket to Ride. However, I feel like it changes the game enough to make it much more interesting. It's inevitable that another player will claim track you were hoping for and the alternate paths are often terribly expensive.

A nice, more challenging, yet lower player number variant to a classic game.

That being said, Nordic Countries represents the first Ticket to Ride game where I have felt decimated by other people's track placement within the first five turns.

The little rule quirks are numerous: no locomotives can be used on standard routes, except for Murmansk to Lieska in which case they can be used as part of 4 cards which can substitute a colour card; otherwise locomotives can only be used for ferries and tunnels; locomotives don't cost 2 actions to pick up nor do 3 in the 5 card display trigger discarding; for ferries any 3 cards can substitute a locomotive i.e for icon requirements plus the required color spaces; a couple of routes don't typically look like double routes but they are.

Although the eldest (8yo) has only lining up the trains on the map, after seeing another Ticket to Ride video, I managed to convince him to play Nordic otherwise there was no reason to buy another map just to gather dust on the shelf.

Now Nordic isn't the best version to introduce the brand as it has a few rule quirk adding to overhead for my son's comprehension. Thankfully again being familiar with the system I decided to do away with the tickets and just played with getting sets of cards (hands open) with the only rule being that the trains had to connect to each other. This seemed to work well, he started to link a network, understanding what was needed (visual contract for scoring complete lines) and got quite excited by it. Interesting to find out how Ticket to Ride: My First Journey trims down the design to make it easy for 6yo and up as even with 2 of us was quite an effort to maintain interest. Thankfully my son did well not to have a meltdown losing ('it doesn't matter') though he wanted to play out his trains to get nearer to my score.

Good game, but I don't prefer it to TTR or TTR:Europe. The rule changes are minor tweaks and don't really set it apart from the other 2. The map supposedly encourages more blocking your opponents and aggressive play but I don't really see it, and the 3 player limit really limits its appeal for me as I like base TTR best with 4 or more opponents.

Great version of a great game. The ferries and tunnels add a little bit more that you have to worry about, while the basic gameplay still remains simple enough that beginners can pick it up quickly. The only disadvantage is that the max players are 3, but that's a minor qualm with how good it is otherwise.

RATING: 5
I'd put this on my cull list but the whole reason I got it was to have a good gateway on hand. It's really far too simple for me and plays too long for what it is. However, I am giving the iOS version a lot of love lately. It's a perfect implementation for this type of game and it plays in 5-10 minutes against the AI, which is the time investment I expect for something this simple. Still, it is yet another game to keep around for my son one day. 

EDIT: My rating is for the cardboard version. I would rate the iOS version a bit higher, perhaps a 7, just for playing faster.

A TTR map for purely 2-3 players. The map is smaller, which means there are less routes. It's a lot more competitive and cutthroat than the other maps. Blocking other players is a very viable strategy. Some rule changes regarding locomotives and ferries were made in this game.

A good variant for TTR. robably will be my go to version for 3 players. The map has some real bottlenecks where you can get blocked. Much harder to accomplish your goals Also liked how the Capitals ended up to be a big city version a lot of tickets had one of them as part of it. 

Locomotive cards are much less useful in this game - even more so than Switzerland seems to be a smaller amount of ferries and tunnels than on the Swiss map

I was very happy to pick up the English copy before the holidays and got it out on the table in December 2008.  The three-player game was a lot different and the routes were so much more important than simply putting long trains down on the board.  Surprisingly, it made for a much different game than the other versions I have played.  Looking forward to getting some more experience with this game.

I have the same problem with this game as I did with the USA version. The drawing 2 cards a turn just makes the game silly as you spend 90% of the game doing a really mundane task. Other than that, this version is much better than the USA one. The artwork here is amongst the prettiest I've seen in any game ever... almost magical. The game is also pretty intense as there is quite a shortage of routes and every turn you draw cards is a turn you may fail a mission. It doesn't play 4-5 players, but that's okay as you can play other games for that range. It's better than regular TtR, but that drawing nonsense still irks me.

One of the best lighter games in 45-60 minute time frame. The game is very cutthroat and very interactive. You should try to build your connections in a manner that you don't reveal your plans too early. You need to follow your opponents strategy from the beginning. You should try to block critical chokepoints when you have the chance. The timing of drawing new tickets is crucial and tring to fit them into your strategy. The luck factor vs. length is in good balance. Replay value is basically unlimited. I really enjoy this game.

My personal average rating across TtR, TtR:Europe, TtR:Nordic Countries, and TtR: Germany.

I like this but can't rate it quite as highly as the original. It makes a nice change and does provide a tight two player game. However the wildcard/tunnel/extra long route rules are a bit fiddly. They are not complicated but the beauty of original TtR is that there are so few rules that it is easy to teach. The extra rules here describe particular cases and exceptions which may make the game more balanced but just add to the amount players have to remember.

This map didn't do it for me.  The new rules for engines reduce luck of draw from the deck in one way, but they increase luck of the draw in another (since you now have a much harder time finding a given color you need).  The really long gray route is a bit swingy, and I don't like extensive use of tunnels.

All in all, I felt there was more AP but less strategy.

In our first play, my wife completely blocked off the northern third of the map.  That was partially my fault for not paying attention to what she was doing, but we still ended up stopping the game.  The board is unforgiving in that aspect.  There are fewer "ways around" on this map than previous ones, I think.  I also don't know what to think about not being able to play locomotive (wild) cards on normal routes.  They are only playable on tunnel and ferry routes.  Additionally, though, you can draw two locomotives (wilds) on your turn instead of only one from previous TtR versions.  I am still very happy with the purchase, though, as I'm sure it will come to the table many times in the near future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have only two very minor issues with this game: 1) a bit expensive (gaming material only for three people, yet sold at the same price as the other TtR-games) 2) bad choice of player colors (the trains are white, black and purple - why two dark colors instead of green or red)

So, an excellent game for 2 or 3 players.

REVISED:
Something about this map makes it a great game for two players.  We pretty much split our plays between this and Mega City (1910) USA.

ORIGINAL:
On first glance it's simply another variation in the TTR family.  There are only a handful of gameplay changes beyond the newer map.  The biggest of these is the fact that locomotives aren't "wilds" in the sense of the both USA and Europe.  They can't be played on normal routes and can only be part of Ferries and Tunnels.  This was hard to adjust to in our first play since both of us got a lot of them but didn't have a great place to use them.  I'm sure we will have it as a regular game in our evening mix because, heck, it's TTR.  But not sure how often we will choose it over USA with the 1910 expansion (still my absolute favorite way to play).

Of all the "base" versions of [b]Ticket to Ride[/b] (USA, Europe, Nordic, Marklin) this one easily plays the best with 2 or 3 players (best with 3, I think).

With fewer trains, the game is shorter (which is good) but it does limit your chances in completing a lot of tickets.

There is also a nice race aspect to finish the track of 9 trains first to claim the 27 points it gives (but then this limits you even more in completing tickets).

This is a good one. If you could pick only two versions of the game, I would get this one for 2-3 and [b]Europe[/b] for 4-5.

Very nice for 2-3 players, as the map is compact, tight and encourages interaction (a.k.a. screwage). I like the Globetrotter bonus which replaces the European Express bonus, as it is more worthwhile to screw others and build all over the place (instead of lengthening your main route), making gameplay more unpredictable. The artwork is spectacular. Probably the easiest TtR to teach, after USA and on par with Switzerland. A no-brainer to pull out for 2-3 non-gamers. Slightly prefer this to Switzerland.

This one was certainly worth the wait.  I wanted to game solely because of the subject matter (I was an exchange student to Finland), not really caring how it played.  However, I was happy to discover that it plays very well.  It easily is my preferred 2-3 player game in the series.  In fact, it has now become my favorite of the maps available.  At least part of this is due to the artwork, which I particularly enjoy.  Beyond that, I enjoy the layout of the map and the interaction of the destination cards.  Because of the importance of the capitals and a few other locations, there are opportunities for particularly vicious play (if that's your thing).  Of course, you can always play nice.  Overall, a fine addition to the series that I am happy they made available in the USA. [11/12/2008] [8]
--------------------------------------------
I've had to go ahead and bump this one up to a 9.  It has easily supplanted the original TTR as my favorite in the series and is quickly on its way to being the most played. [05/07/2009]

This game is a hit in our house.  My wife, who never asks to play games and usually only plays games one day a year (on my Birthday), has requested this one numerous times.  I've played other versions of Ticket to Ride hundreds of times and I enjoy this one as much as any of those.  Plus, it includes my favorite player color - purple!

It sounds like this is the best TtR for 2 or 3 players.  I've never actually played TtR before though.  It always struck me as too simple (a great gateway game, but wouldn't really satisfy me, I thought.  I know that sounds arrogant, and I'm probably wrong in my assessment of it).

More or less Ticket to Ride: Europe, but without the train depots. I like it better because it's a bit more confrontational. Although, let's face it: it's still a Ticket to Ride game, which is the My Little Ponies of gateway games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
If you typically are only able to play Ticket To Ride with 2 or 3 players, this would be an excellent choice.  Pretty much the same as other TtR games, with a few minor changes, but it's pretty fun.  The hardest part is trying to remember where all the cities are.  It can be frustrating when trying to go north, as the further north you go, the less open lines there are to get there, but that also makes it more important to plan carefully.

It seems to be a bit better than the Ticket to Ride: Switzerland, as I lost a game of that when we ran out of ticket cards.

In my one game Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries I lost even though I completed 13 of 14 tickets.  I think the winner completed 8.  The Southeastern section of the map is similar to the section of the Western Europe map in Ticket to Ride: Europe as the connections are shorter, meaning that you will need to complete more tickets.  It seems like a good idea to have a route connecting the capital  cities of Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, and possibly Copenhagen as lots of tickets seem to have one of these cities as an end point.

Also, the locamotive cards are much less valuable in this game, making the longer connections seem much more difficult.

RATING: 8
It's just more TTR, for the most part, but it's a good map, but lacks the cool extras from Asia, India, Africa, Netherlands and the versatility of USA 1910.

[hr]Actually, this one is a very well designed 2 player map, which now that I am a better TTR player I can appreciate more:

* Most routes are colored (like Africa), forcing players to reveal their strategy more heavily which lets you look for signals

* Lack of "longest road" bonus incentivizes blocking plays, because you aren't worried about losing your 10 point bonus by playing in a random spot

* 40 trains instead of 45 buffs tempo based strategies that end the game before the opponent can finish

* Tunnels I used to dislike as too fiddly for the game, but the risk/reward factor of accidentally revealing your route if you gun for the tunnels too early in a 2 player game is very interesting

* Many short routes, and the prevalence of blocking strategies, encourage more action to happen sooner and in waves, instead of just massing cards for the end game which some maps suffer from.

Other TTR maps have SOME of these elements to make them a great 2 player experience (India, Africa, Switzerland, USA 1910), but this may very well have the most elements that make it a great 2 player experience.

I mostly play Ticket to Ride 2 player and this version is probably my favourite for that reason. I like that there is no longest route bonus and you can concentrate on trying to get lots of short routes. I also like how tight the board is with only 2 or 3 players. Some of the other versions feel almost like solo games when played with 2.

My girlfriend refers to this as 'Ticket to Ride: Purple' because she loves how purple everything is and always wants the purple trains...

Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries offers an unforgiving map for two/three players. Wildcards are no longer restricted, but they can only be used on ferries and tunnels. Both ferries and tunnels are abundant so there is still a lot of tension, even without the restictions. Also, there are a lot of critical one train routes, so expect a lot of blocking. The ticket distribution allows for some difficult choices.
Ticket to Ride: Europe will always be my favorite of the lot, but Nordic Countries is definitely the second best map out there.

There seems to be quite the opportunity for screwage here, although that didn't occur too much in our first game.  My rating could even go up to a nine and that's for three players.  I think it would be fun for two, but three is the sweet spot because of the battles for certain track segments.

I like this version of the game because it's very well designed. Rules are simple and very similar to the other TtR titles but this board was specially designed for 2/3 players and I must say that, at least, the 3 player game is very good. The map is very tight and if played with the right spirit (positive play AND occasional stabbing) works pretty damn well. 
It has other strong advantages comparing to original TtR: since it has only 2/3 players it's faster, tighter and straightforward and also the perfect choice for newbies. It may be my favorite title of the series (so far I know Marklin, Europe and original).

Another entertaining variant of the well-known train game. There's some major screwage potential, as there are quite a few choke points, which are easy to block. So making your tickets is a much bigger issue than in, for example, the base game or Switzerland. for that reason, I think I prefer this version over those two, but still consider Märklin the best. 

But with already three TtR-games on my shelf (not counting the card game), I feel no immediate desire to purchase this one.

Nice to see they released this game in America.  Good addition to my collection and will get played a lot with family members.  Good alternative to the original TTR for the wife and I.  Seems to be 1 certain area you need to concentrate on to be successful, as it seems 95% of the cards run through the Bergen-Oslo-Copenhagen-Stockholm-Helsinki double route.  You get those 5 cities connected, you are set for a 130+ pts, easy.

Surprisingly fiddly rules to remember for a TTR game. i.e. when can/can't use loco, the any 3 for 1 loco on ferry, and any 4 for a card of any colour for 9 length route, loco only for ferry and tunnels, no draw restriction for locos. Still great though.

[Day of Wonder 08 English Edition] {Train; drafting, set-collection, connection; scalable} TtR:Nordic is a very beautiful take of Ticket to Ride.  The cards and board are very beautiful.

It is a nice variant to original TtR.  The board is designed to increase competitiveness between players.  The rule modification to the locomotives cards is good for the board changes; otherwise, locomotives cards will become too important for such small board and short routes.  The Globetrotter bonus motivates players to draw and complete more ticket cards, which also increases the competitiveness of the game.  The original TtR is not very good for 2/3p due to low interaction (or competition).  But this one is a good take!  Esp. I usually play games with my wife :)

Way too dry and simplistic for me and my wife.  Player interaction is shallow and infrequent.  Lots of multi-player solitaire, though if you pay attention to the cards your opponent is taking, it can be a little more interesting and strategic.  We enjoyed the first few games, but then quickly lost interest. 

Note that the 1912 expansion with the warehouses and depots does improve the game a bit, giving it a more complexity and interactivity.  With that expansion, we might rate this game a 7 on good day.

Same as Ticket to Ride, but a tighter map for two and three players.  I like Ticket to Ride, but the USA map can get a little old after a while, and I wasn't all that big a fan of Europe and Marklin.  This keeps the Ticket to Ride gameplay of USA but makes it tighter for the lower number of players.

Still the best gateway game there is.  If my gamegroup didn't hate the game so much I would have so many more converts to our hobby, but they rebel when I try to bring this out.

Renamed "Ticket to FUCK YOU", this is by far the most mean spirited version if Ticket to Ride there is, the table talk was good times.  Mechanically its somewhere between Ticket to Ride USA and Europe, I found myself wishing there was something a little different or original about it but that is sort of a moot desire.  The board is much tighter, the cards overlap far more and its considerably easier to be a douche-a-tron 4000 with the ability to ruin peoples tickets this time round.  All and all the best variant for small groups of 2 to 3, however I don't recommend playing with anyone you plan to ever sleep with as they may disembowel you in your Nordic destination haunted slumber.

3 DEC 2010: OK, Marklin is now my favorite, but I still really like this version although I need to play both more to see which one is best. This still has a tighter board (and the super-long link that is fun to hit if you can)
----------------------------------
After having played the standard TTR and TTR:Switzerland, I think this might be my favorite so far. There's a bit more to think about as you must use different combinations of cards for different routes which balances very well and forces you to plan differently. The only drawback is that it's only for 2 or 3 players. I think 3 is best, but sometimes we have 4 players and can't play this game.

RATING: 7.5
I have to admit that as furious as this game can sometimes make me, I have a lot more fun with it than the original Ticket to Ride. There are a lot of ways to nastily block your opponent from reaching their destination, period--you're out of luck if you're trying to get to Oslo; I've got all the routes covered. You have to get really good at hiding your destinations if you don't want to be sabotaged. For two players, this game is a lot more cutthroat (and fun) than the original. A few negatives--the new rules aren't complicated, but they don't make a lot of sense. Double-dipping on your tickets is pretty easy and if you luck out you can get a lot of points for essentially the same route. Still, I like this game a lot and I'll probably always use it for my 2-player Ticket to Ride fix from now on and keep the other in reserve for larger groups.

Very tight board in the TtR series makes for a very confrontational game. In the one 3-player game that I played, I had a 76 point swing in score due to not being able to draw a blue card in the last 4 turns, leaving me with 20 points. Great game for 2-3 players. Beautiful, beautiful artwork on the board and cards.

I'm not a fan of the Ticket to Ride franchise, but this would be my favorite title if I were.  Nordic Countries features a tighter board and limits the number of players to three, which shortens downtime considerably.  In other words, if you have a girlfriend who wants to play TTR, this is the fastest way to get it over with.

It's common knowledge by now, but this is the best Ticket to Ride for two players. Also adds a few new elements to make this slightly more of a gamer's game than the standard TtR.

This board is the pinnacle for me for Ticket to Ride. Its so tight and cutthroat. And it has a 9 train track!! I still too often fall into a trap of going for a few long destinations when many short destinations is generally a better tactic. Either way I have a blast playing it.

We finally were able to get a copy of the newest edition of one of our favourite games.  We contemplated buying the foreign version but for THAT price, we bought a house instead.  We scooped up the English version.  Because we only usually game with the two of us, this is a great alternative to the base TTR (1910 helps that problem also).  I love the theme and the artwork.  This is quickly becoming my favorite in the TTR series.

This one is my favorite of all the TTR games!

A nice, tight map for two or three players.  You don't have to be cutthroat for things to get testy, the board will do that for you.  The locomotive card changes (only on ferries and tunnels) make building regular track tougher, but the ability to use three or four regular cards for a locomotive give you an out on ferries, tunnels and the Murmansk route.

Snow themed cards, colors and artwork are a nice touch.

For two or three, I think I like this better than the Swiss map, where you can load up on several cards that pay off for the exact same route (not just the usual overlapping ones).

RATING: 7
My first TtR game to get this low of a rating but hey the rules as they are out of the box just isn't much fun. The ferries first appeared in TtR:Europe and well they were few so it worked. Nordic Countries has so many you spend a ton of time drawing, and drawing, and drawing, waiting on locomotives to come up!!! This is bad! So we adapted it to all ferries now act like Tunnels and the rule from Switzerland about locomotives can ONLY be used on tunnels and it plays much much better. 

UPDATE: Rating increased due to use of TTR:Dice Expansion. I really hated waiting for the loco's in this rule set but now with the wilds come up on the dice and it's much easier to mitigate the need/lack of them than with the card draws. I love this map and now have fun playing it but ONLY will play with the dice.

For me, the Ticket to Ride series as a whole provides an excellent example of how much atmosphere can be produced by a few cosmetic touches; here the snow on the train tickets, and the box and board artwork as a whole do amazing work in evoking a rich, wintery feel.

I like also that the real geography of the region informs the gameplay. Not just in terms of the shape of the map, but also in that the bulk of tickets focus on the more populous south - which is the crucial imbalance that creates the game's tough decisions; while connections in the north are tougher to complete, needing more cards in general, and more locomotives, there's less demand for them than those in the south.

This is a very tense and exciting game! Each of the four times I have played this so far, I have tried different strategic approaches to the game. I love the cutthroat nature of the game, making this one of my favorite two-player game. In one two-player game I played, I completed the 9 train Murmansk-Lieska route and failed to complete the Copenhagen-Murmansk ticket by a single train! 
I love accumulating a huge hand of cards for the 9 train route- a risky strategy if another player is attempting to claim it as well, but the reward of 27 points sure is satisfying! I love this game and can't wait to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very cut-throat. With 2 players, searching a turn too long for a card can lead to a (seemingly) inevitable loss, but as it plays quick it's not much of a problem. The occassional game isn't much fun due to the above phenomenon...I guess you need to change strategy immediately, which unfortunately sometimes seems like it's necessary to just collect cards and throw down the longest routes. I fear that sometimes we don't know how to strategize correctly.

TTR Nordic is a great game, but I am not sure that the adjustments from the original makes the game better. It's much more difficult reaching your tickets, which I think is a bad thing.

Perhaps even better with 2 than with 4 in the original game in this incarnation.  The map is nice and tight.  With fewer players the rewards for blocking other players become higher.  It is also easier to predict and more fun to do.  This game can be played very viciously which I enjoy.

April 2017: Bought our own copy.
Oct 2017: Still our #1 TTR recommendation for anyone playing at primarily 2P or even 3P.  Great map, gorgeous art.  Rating 9.5.

My parents bought this version since the 2-3 player is perfect for them alone or for when I'm visiting.  We all love it!  The rules aren't too hard to learn but are complex enough to make for a fun game.  We played twice and had a different winner each time.  The second time I thought I had it won and then on the last round Mom played the 9 train route - bringing her to a victory by only 2 points!

There is some luck factor involved in the destination cards.  If you start out with tricky ones in your first hand you'll likely be drawing new ones early and hoping for better luck.  But overall it doesn't feel like it's too heavily luck based and has enough strategy to keep it from being boring.  Highly recommend this version for anyone wanting to play TtR with a smaller group!

I like this game but there's not enough new stuff to get me to buy it.  I haven't played TTR Europe yet but I understand it has most of the same mechanisms.  There are no wilds on normal tracks, Ferries require locomotives, 3 of any color can be used for a locomotive, tunnels can use locomotives as wildcards but to complete it you flip 3 cards and if any match that color you have to pay extra.  A good game as are all TTR games that I've played.

It was years from the first play, it was a two player game, where both of us were mainly on the opposite sides of the board. It didn't convince me. The last time there were three of us and the board was more crowded. It felt better, too.

The game itself is a simple Ticket to Ride variant for 2 to 3 players. There are couple of twists to the other versions, but nothing spectacular. Ok game.

Updated after a two player play. Now there were some competition, so the board felt quite nice. I'd say okay for two or three players, but I still prefer the Switzerland.

This one is sure to come out during Christmas time as it is probably the only game I have with a wintery feel. This one is easy to teach even to non-gamers and can still be played strategically.

Do you like Ticket to Ride?  Then there's a pretty good chance you'll like the game.  In addition, if you've played Switzerland, then you're 90% of the way to knowing how to play this map straight out of the box.  The only difference is the inclusion of a 9-train route, and the ability to use four identical cards of a different color as one card of another color to complete this route.  Otherwise, the rules are the same (though Nordic Countries has removed the country-to-country tickets, which I actually liked).

I have issues with Nordic Countries like I do with Switzerland, due to removing the use of locomotives for ANY route.  It relegates a portion of the game to simply drawing cards, hoping to get the right one to complete the route you need, and it gets tedious.  The 9-train link, the 4-for-1 wild rule for that link, and the 3-for-1 locomotive rule for ferries help a lot, though.  It might balance out some by leaving one player with a whole heck of a lot of cards in hand to complete routes across the board, but between the two of us at the end of the game, we had about half of the train deck in our hands.  On the good side, the tickets seem to follow the Big Cities design, which means players will be all up in each others' kitchens in no time at all.  Further plays will reveal if this is, in fact, the case.

I'm shocked that this game has the price tag it has.  I didn't pay this much for either the US or Europe, and I received much more (and much better) components for the price.  I think Days of Wonder is really working that "limited edition" tag for all it's worth.  But, listen to me BAAAAH, because I bought it.  How could I not?  I enjoy the games, and I'm sure I will play this one many times.

Slightly more complex than the original TTR with the ferry and tunnel routes. Depending on your mood and the situation in-game, using these routes can be either more entertaining (usually, since you're forced to either strategize more or just take some risks) or more frustrating (occasionally, when you simply can't get the wildcards needed to complete them).

If you're not familiar with the languages and/or geography of Northern Europe, you'll be looking between your route cards and the map a lot to figure out where most of the cities are.

Nothing new really but a 2-3 player version of the game with tunnels and ferries.  If aren't a collector and want a 2-3 player version of TTR get Switzerland instead.  Note, this is a full game with components for up to 3 players and not an expansion.

Nordic Countries is a great version of Ticket to Ride, especially if you play 2 player. The tighter map and new rules make this a great addition to our collection.

Really, really interesting map. It's perfect for two or three players, and incorporates the ferry and tunnel rules. It's difficult to get used to not using Loco cards as wild cards, but it has the ability to use three of any color as a wild card. Pretty neat.

The new twist for this one is that it is 3 player and the wild engines can only be used for ferries and tunnels. Because of this you can take an engine as your second draw. Very tight board and easy to get blocked out of a city. I love the purple gray and blacks in the design. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played a few times (with 3 players). An interesting variation on the TTR system, but not my favourite one. The rules for ferries are a bit strange and not intuitive, and there is something in the map which I don't like, even though I'm unable to point out what exactly. Still, it remains a good variation on a good system.

The tightest Ticket to Ride map so far. Many choke points and blocking opportunities. An interesting decision to be made is whether to play it safe and stay in the south or go for bigger points with a risky route north.

A devious version of Ticket To Ride. The smaller board makes it more fun for just two players. Though there is a bit of a secret to it it seems. Once you figure that out, you can usually slaughter who you are playing.

This is a great version of Ticket to Ride.  Espeically since there are 3 of us in the family.  It is soooo much easier to set up & put away than the Marklin edition.  The map is huge & easy to read.  I like the way the tunnels & ferries work.  This may become the only verion we play.

A very robust variant on Ticket to Ride. It's basically TtR Europe with a couple of minimal rules changes, although I think I prefer Switzerland for 2 or 3 players. Still, it's TtR, which means it's automatically great.

RATING: 8
The last plays of TtR games have been very enjoyable to me.  I like the Nordic map as I think it is tight for two (haven't played with three), but offers enough alternate routes that if your optimum is cut, you still have options open to you.  The different rules for the rainbow locomotives must be remembered as I am often wanting to use those as true wild cards on all my routes.  I could also do without the tunnel rules; however, it does tighten things up on the western side of the board.  With the myriad of tunnels and "broken" tickets found in [gameid=30746], TtR:NC is my choice for 2-3 player TtR, although [gameid=9209] is good for 3 as well (and geographically more familiar).

Agradable de jugar, como todos los aventureros al tren que he probado, pero prefiero jugar a otros porque la gente se pierde al no conocer las ciudades de este mapa.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I know I'm in the minority, but the locomotive rules feel tacked on and slow the game down with more frequent and less fruitful draws from the deck.  Sure, the extra cards can be repurposed into the Murmansk route (at 4:1) and ferry spaces (at 3:1), but why encourage more blind drawing into even bigger hands?  The action on this condensed map is in the blocking and countering; the goal should be to get to that as quickly as possible and maintain it.

Gameplay is actually much smoother using the locomotive rules from TTR, and just ignoring the ferry icons that were used to better effect in TTR: Europe.  Three players is superior to two, as the western side of the map becomes a more viable option for one player while the other two likely fight it out over the south to east corridor.  Components are top-notch; the game looks fantastic on the table.

Best TtR edition in my book. Tight with 2 or 3.
The non-existing order of cities on tickets is pretty annoying. Especially when playing with kids who just learn to read or people who don’t know Scandinavian geography.

RATING: 8
If Ticket to Ride Europe is "nice," this version is mean. The map is small, and several junctions are key to controlling the map. I've avoided playing with three players because even a two-player game can get claustrophobic. Having said that, I love the Nordic map. It's highly strategic and somewhat unique for a TTR variant.

Tighter than Switzerland, and the production quality is definitely much better.  I really like the new art style on the destination and train cards, the wintery theme make the whole game seem festive.  The play felt very cutthroat, even unintentionally.  The only thing I didn't care for was the rule in which you can trade a certain number of cards in lieu of the locomotive/wild you need to claim a ferry route, seem to give people too much leeway in building.  Oh, the half-used plastic insert was a big turn off as well.

If not for the limited availability as well as the ridiculous price, I'd totally add this to my collection.

I love the fact that they included enough trains so that you can use the purple and white in other versions of Ticket to Ride.

After one play, the board seems as if it would be really tight with three players.

A pretty brutal 2-3 player version of TTR.  Brutal in that it's evil.  It's very easy to block opponents.  The closure of double routes in a 2-player game could be crushing.

I completed 12 tickets in a 3p game.  Can anyone top that?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think it's odd that I've played this game so often.  I don't particularly like it.  Luck is one thing, but in this game it can often lead to an exercise in frustration with one person picking every turn just to get that last orange or red, ending up with 30-40 cards and STILL without the color needed.  Strategy is easily stymied by this ugly situation.  I will say that the better player will win 9 times out of 10, so luck can be mitigated, but when you are on a bad streak, it sucks.

As for the game in general, it isn't really that exciting.  pick up some cards, lay down some track, rinse, repeat.  overall, it gets a meh.

This is quite a nice scenario for 2-3 players; never boring, always at least a little tense, and several opportunities for messing up your opponents' plans. The little special touches for this version are nice: the rules about the extra long route, the lack of true wild cards, etc. Fast too, easy to play several in a row, which offsets the still-present dependence on luck (both in ticket draw and train draw).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great! This version is really great for two (or three players), which was a disadvantage of the previous versions. A more intense map gives the players less feeling of multiplayer solitaire when playing two or three players.
Anyhow, I recommend owning both the Europe version and the Nordic version, since they complement each other depending on number of players.

Not entirely sold to the whole Ticket to Ride series of game. Sure, it is easy to teach to non-gamers, but you are left with a somewhat shallow game that doesn't feel very strategic.

I'll still be playing it since it's one of the very few games my girlfriend is willing to play.

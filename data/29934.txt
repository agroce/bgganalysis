An excellent example of the sort of game that I shoul avoid buying. Very solid but it offers nothing new in mechanics and quite happily sits on the shelf with all those other games that, if I only had one or two of them I would think were great, but unfortunately it's just one of the pack. I'm spoilt really.

Excellent underrated game. Only played two player. Lots of interaction. Difficult choices. Many ways to win and to lose. Impressive mix of strategy and tactics. Only quibble is whether you can win if your opponent gets the top bank and the best caravan card early.

Very smooth game flow and nice interaction of several different game mechanics I really enjoy this tactical game. Almost like a cluster of mini-games that you have to solve and balance to be successful.

RATING: 8
Has that "Ystari feel" to it, in that it's a placement game with multiple, well-balanced decisions and scoring paths.  

You play the role of a gardener of the Hanging Gardens, and each round you have to carefully manage your two forms of currencies (money to hire workers and camels to visit locales and acquire plants and special abilities), as well as your action selections, which of course are intertwined with the currencies.

You essentially have one of two choices each round (again depending on your cash and camel flow): 1) select a worker, with the earlier choices being free, and the later ones increasing in cost, or travel with your camel, with movement initially being quite limited and costly.

Worker selection consists of engineers which irrigate the garden and give immediate as well as potential later cumulative points (this is one of the avenues to score points in the game), and irrigation is an essential step before planting can occur.  Priests can be used to take actions in the temples which have a nice balancing mechanism that pay out points, camels/money, and resources.  Workers acquire resources, which are worth a victory point each at the end of the game, but more importantly are also essential for planting.  And finally camel traders are the main means of acquiring camel currency.

The caravan can be selected rather than selecting a worker, but ONLY if you have enough camel currency to move the camel, AND you have the appropriate resources to pay wherever you stop.  You can acquire a money card(s), point cards (which increase in value quite rapidly), an improved camel movement card(s), and you can plant a plant in the garden.  Planting is a major way of scoring points and it dictates the end game.

Each plant gives some point value and many give additional awards.  Also there is a bonus point scoring at the end of the game if you have planted enough plants.  The game ends when a certain number of plants are left over- note that there are several different plants so the setup is variable each game, and that the level 3 plants cannot be planted without the help of the valuable gardener card.  The gardener card is generally acquired through careful manipulation of the resource market, and is a very scarce and powerful card that you will want to acquire at some point in the game, as it allows you to "shift" up a level when planting for no additional resource cost.

What I really like about this game is that it's a light feeling "gamer's game", which is to say it's got some real subtle depth, but it's easy to jump in and play and enjoy.  Excellent scalability as well.  Only complaint is the terrible quality, stupid tiny cards!!!! (note to all game publishers: standard size cards only, I'll pay the extra production costs!)

Own the [boardgame=150635]Palace[/boardgame] mini-expansion from the [boardgame=47156]Ystari Box[/boardgame] expansion.

I enjoyed my first playing, although the 2.5 hours we spent on it was rough. It was part due to learning, part due to slower players, but the experience makes me think I will only play this with three, at least until people know the game better. That being said, I enjoyed the interlocking mechanics that comprise the game. There is no way to be good at everything, so you have to find your strength and play hard to it. If you don't carve out a niche early on, it seems like it is pretty difficult to gear up well enough to win. I am curious to see the different paths that one could take; this game is truly a Euro in terms of that. All in all, not amazing, but another fine offering from Ystari that keeps me confident in their ability to repeatedly release quality games.

RATING: 7
High Ystari level, in my personal ranking only Caylus is little better. Like in classic Eurogame there is a lot of way to collect points. To win this game, the good and flexible strategy is required. Although the subject of the game seems to be light, Amyitis is a very complex game for gamers

RATING: 9
Very nice game, with balanced options. Rating is provisional following an introductory 2 player only, but I think this will shine with 3 players. Another outstanding effort from Ystari.

Played with three, and it was excellent, although we took far too long over it. Some concerns about the power of the top banker card that generates 2 coins and 2 vps per turn, but I think it's rather like the Library in San Juan. Namely, other players need to adapt their strategy to counter its effects.

RATING: 3.5
I wasn't overly impressed by my first play.  It's got very a very difficult and rather dull rule book, the game is quite dry and perhaps overly busy and hard to keep a track of - and it goes on too long for what it is with 4 players.  It's very hard to plan as you just have to react to what the other players do - even as regards their passing or not - and how the cards come out and where you sit.  You can gather resources for instance, but then they may be no good if someone else moves the camel.  The artwork is painful and hard to fathom.  I will give it another go with the expansion, but it's the first game by the company that just seemed rather dull.

Amyitis is a somewhat different, interesting Euro.

It's a balance between getting the garden tiles, putting priests in the temples, and chasing the banker/caravaneer/palace cards for points/abilities. You've got to keep an eye on it all, but you don't actually have to do everything. I won while pretty much ignoring the garden tiles--which are sort of the whole point of the game.

I honestly think it's a good design, but for some reason it just didn't really do much for me. The procession and shoving each other out of the temples makes room for some surprisingly cutthroat play. While I'm not totally against that in principle--it really felt a bit unwelcome in this game. Too mean for the kind of Euro game it is.

A lot of things going on, lots of ways to score points, a lot of interchangeable resources, abstract conversion, etc. I enjoyed playing this, but it's a Felding mishmash of game mechanics and all, without the brilliance of Feld.

Somehow Feld designs a game like this and I love it ... I'm still not sure where this one will go. Level 3 banker seems too potent, as well.

More Euro-efficiency with lots going on (the temples, irrigation, resource farming, caravan movement, courtiers to collect,  money tight).  There appear to be several paths to victory.  However, play is repetitive; you are doing the same things on the final turn as on the first.  Because of that, the game feels a bit too long.  It is certainly at the high end of the 60-120 minute playing time quoted by Ystari.  

The artwork and production are up to the usual Ystari standards.  However, they aren't enough to paint over a fairly abstract design, in which you never feel you are doing anything other than collecting vp's.

Not a terrible design.  As this sort of game goes I found it quite painless.  But nor do I feel any pressing need to play it again.

This game has a pleasant blend of several mechanics, combining them seamlessly in a rather simple and straightforward manner.  You've got card drafting, an economic engine, tile placement, a rondel and trading system, variable game board, area control, skill upgrades--the list goes on and on...  But what I really like, in addition to this multiplicity of elements, is the simple game play that underlies them, yielding a game that does an amazing job of combining all of these disparate parts into one cohesive unit.  Sure, it takes a few rounds to get the hang of what's going on, but once you do you're in for simple, yet deep gameplay, which is something I love.

First reaction - neat.  The game play is right up there with other Ystari games and that is good thing.  The game feels like several small area majority/influence games linked together.  Sometimes the links feel sensible but in many cases they leave the players feeling like their play is divided between the various activities (which it is).  If you focus on the mini-games, you may find the game to be shallow, but the depth of this game lies in its breadth.  You have to plan several turns ahead to take full advantage of the options available.  If you like multi-tasking or project management, this game might appeal to you since it will require you to focus on different and separate tasks while keeping a single overarching goal in mind.

A great discovery as I certainly was no Ystari fan. Well, I found in Amyitis the depth and subtlety I had been trying to find in a strategy game for a long time. It is very challenging. And there is more than one way to win (even if I am not as good as i would like to be, I like to try new strategies).

RATING: 5
Another dry, mechanics-centred Ystari game. In the end, this game falls short because the strategic elements a mere distractions to the tactical elements of the game.  This is in part due to the more limited paths to the strategic elements, but also because of the certainty of card clumping in the draft.  Any strategic planning can be completely undone by poor card selection in the draft or by someone playing the caravan at an inopportune time. I'm not fond of games that have a component added in to bait-and-switch the involved players.

Ez egy nagyon színvonalas játék, meglep, hogy nincs nagyobb sikere! Kifejezetten sok ötletes megoldás van benne: tetszik a kártyák beárazása (0,1,2), a tevézés, a papozás, a nyersanyagszerzés, az utolsóként lépő játékost segítő mechanizmus... jóformán minden eleme jó! Könnyebb, mint amilyennek első hallásra tűnik, már az 1. kör végére tökéletesen átlátható. Talán néhány lap túl erős (pl. a körönként 2 pénz + 2 GYP)... Mindenkinek ajánlom kipróbálásra, aki szereti a többi Ystarit!!

Amyitis is one of those games I tend to like, even if I can clearly see its problems: it is quite abstract, it has ugly graphics (pretty standard for Ystari, but this time it is worse than ever, with the design of fields and temples!), and it is more tactical than strategic because of the cards...
Nevertheless, it has some appeal for the euro-fan: the resource management is unusual and interesting, and the game plays reasonably well with 2 (and the girlfriend likes it!). More plays are needed to define it better, but surely it deserves some more table-time...

There's nothing that new here. It seems kind of familiar, lots of ways to get points and you just have to focus on one path to victory. It felt familiar, yet it still had a feel of its own. We'll see how I feel after more plays.

My second play, it seemed a little easier. I still like it, but I'm wondering if you can just use the same strategy over and over again. I decided to try to go for palaces and caravans, and I did, and I won. I also got enough plant tiles for the 5-point bonus. It seemed easy to just stick to my plan. However, I suppose if someone else is going for the same plan or one that overlaps yours, you need to modify as you go. I like this game, but I want to really like it. So far, it's good, but not great.

Subsequent plays have seen my caravan/palace strategy fail, at times miserably. My last game, I got the level-3 caravaneer after only a couple of turns, but I never could get enough resources to take advantage of it, and everyone else caught up--and far surpassed me--very quickly. You really need to go with what the cards give you. There weren't many peasants, and I was trying to save up on camels, but I should have gone for engineers or priests. Without good resources, the camels never really mattered much. I love this game more and more. There are just so many ways to win (or lose). 

It did play fine with both 3 and 4 players. I'm looking forward to trying it with 2.

UPDATE: Finally played with 2 players. It was great. A bit unbalanced when one player is inexperienced, but that happens with more players, as well. There's a lot to this game. But the feel with just two players was the same, except that there's a bit less tension with some of the court cards, because you don't remove any, so both players can get to the top levels in Caravaneers, and I think Bankers, too, though I'm not positive about that.

Never took my attention before, but in my first play it was a really good experience.

A lot of things going on, you can't be in everything... have to decide some of them (buildings cards, collecting money cards, entering in the temples,...). Really good.

*update*

Purchased and traded.

*update*

After7 years, I played it again last night. The game is OK but the main downside with me is the lack of control and the absence of a compensation mechanism for those who made a mistake early. I don't regret had traded years ago. I prefer many other games of the same weight.

The Palace Expansion improves the game (finally an expansion that improves a game)

Too abstract for my liking.  Learning curve is pretty steep... so don't expect to win your first game.  Much like Pizarro & Co., there are only a limited number of players that can advance on some of the technology "tracks" (e.g. banking or temples).  Also, I was disappointed that the caravan moves so rapidly... and one player (stuck with a zero level camel) cannot afford to move the caravan much so he's at the mercy of the other players.  ** Note for future plays:  the resource discs are pretty scarce so the farming action is quite valuable, and banking on it's own is not a viable strategy since money doesn't buy you much if the good cards have been taken already.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Clever mechanics in this game mean that you can't be ahead in everything. You have to focus on faster moving camels or more income or more VP cards (not everyone can have each of these) and then decide if you want to grab more resources, put more effort into getting benefits from temples and so on. 

The game I have played of this so far was very close as I stretched a VP lead over the other 2 players who both developed camels early to give them more flexibility. I had to hope that I could get enough VPs on the board before they could catch up. I beat one but not the other, but the different choices you can make give rise to an interesting game that I want to play again and am happy that I have just bought for a knock down price!

Ugh, really didn't like this at all :( Where to start? Box art is nice (but has little to do with the game unfortunately ...)
With the Caravan's you seem at the mercy of the player to your right, going 4th in a round sucks if there aren't 4 copies of the card you need (eg farmers) and it's no problem if there are. Bank/Money cards seem really powerful. Theme is pasted on and it is just a dry abstract. But my main problem with the game is it is totally tactical - yes you can dream of a strategy, but you have no way of controlling if you can follow it. Overall just felt frustration rather than fun playing it. 

** Update, played again (well it was a '3' could be convinced to play ...) and yep, I really don't like this one at all, dry, tedious and frustrating - where's the fun? Can't rate it a 1 as it's not broken, but I was tempted ...

Maybe I just don't like the Ystari games.  I felt like I was just pushing cubes around the board.  My rating may change upon subsequent plays.

This game doesnt forgive any bad actions and false decisions, but i like that.Sometimes better with 2 than 4 players and the actions you do are forcing your opponents to do something, they plan for a later stage. So, yes i would call it interaction! I triggered it over ebay on my shelf together with the Palace expansion and a possible 5th player addon.

Even to the last action it was not easy to see who the winner was.

Rating based on one play.  Liked it well enough, even though I didn't make the clearest connections between my actions and the outcome of the game until about 9/10 of the way through.  The whole caravan thing may end up being too chaotic for my tastes, particularly towards the end of the game as people get more movement bonuses, but there may be ways to mitigate that which I didn't see during the first game.

RATING: 6
The name sounds like a disease. But it's about building one of the seven ancient wonders of the world (The Hanging Plants of Babylon), but one wouldn't know that from playing this game.

Overall, a tad soulless wrt theme. However, it is a decent euro with multiple paths to victory. Lots of timing issues which is key. Having the right resource at the right time is integral to doing well in the game.

It is not breaking new ground but is enjoyable on the odd occasion.

Update: on the 3 try, liked it more. Upgrade from 7 to 7.5.

Uh oh (update): after 7 plays it decreased from 7.5 -> 6.5. The game is not balanced for players that don't get in on certain cards. ie getting locked out of the caravan
cards is deadly; especially compounded if locked out of the money and VP cards too. There is no balancing mechanism for this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game with pasted on theme, clever but repetitive mechanics, little player interaction, a tad too much downtime which makes the game feel longish and quality desing including the graphics and components.

An interesting game where each turn you set yourself up for the following turns.  A great game for fans of medium to heavy euros.  I rate it a 7 because while I recognise it is a good solid game design, it is not a style of game I particularly enjoy.  It is a little too 'perfect information' or 'abstract' for my liking.  Still, it is a solid design and offers plenty in the way of intelligent and strategic play.

RATING: 4
This is a funny one.   There are so many concepts thrown into the game that it's completely overwhelming when you first set up and learn the rules.  There's just so much STUFF.  There are coins, victory points, plants, plant upgrades, the obligatory CAMELS, temple markers, worker markers, coin cards, camel cards, starting player rules, last player messing with the temple rules, victory point bonus cards, hanging garden tiles, resource cards, irrigation spots, irrigation cards, temple cards, ending conditions, a board that a camel runs around.... AHHH MAKE IT STOP!    It's pretty ridiculous.   However, the game itself isn't too bad.  It does seem very difficult to get an edge on the other players, and the resources were a little too tight for my liking, limiting your options significantly...  so, mixed feelings on this one.   Could be talked into playing it again, but not sure I could be talked into listening to all of the rules again.

I like Ystari a lot, and I like the components - I'll vouch for Amyitis.  It does have something of a runaway winner problem, though - if one player gets the 3rd level bank early on, it can get really ugly (like 30+ points difference ugly).  With more than two, I think the game would be more likely to shine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is actually a good design, with lots of tense moments and interesting decisions to make on your turn. Each turn presents a diminishing set of options, both in terms of hiring workers and in the race to get upgrades, so choices can get very tight very fast.

My biggest problem with the game is that, with only two players, it often feels like there are not enough choices. For example, sometimes only one or two farmers come out, which makes it near-impossible to get resources (which then makes it very difficult to do other things on the board). This means turn order is crucial, and a player can get locked out of actions really fast, (particularly if you're low on cash). If you like punishing games that often leave you with nothing else to do but pass for extra cash, you might love this, but to me it's too limiting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Long game, which is finally decided by one or two tactical decisions. Long term planning is nearly impossible, because it is too difficult to forsee available options. However, the mechanics are sound.

Amyitis seems like a game where you pick your strategy straight out of the gate and go with it.  There are a few different strategies to pursue and all seem to be fairly well balanced at first blush.  The limited available actions make every turn fairly tense, as there are always more things you want to do than you're capable of doing and the actions of other players can really screw your best laid plans!  I'll need more play to see if my initial impressions are right.

[u]January 2010[/u] Played it one year ago and just realized I hadn't commented on it yet.
My game was played in a bar in Paris, so not my copy. Although I liked the game pretty much, I don't think it brings anything really new to my collection, no new feeling. The game is very well balanced (well as much as I could judge after just 1 play!).
I'd say this is a pretty solid eurogame, a lot better than most like Pillars but there still is not enough to keep me interested.

Once more, this is after 1 play so don't put too much weight on my comment.

This is a game I'd be happy to play another time but not one I would actively seek.

Wow! This game really took me by suprise.  There is a lot going on and it can really make you feel like your being left behind.  There are some really refreshing mechanics happening that change your choices drastically. I especially enjoy the Temple mechanic (the conveyor belt movement) and how the person to go last gets a free action there.  With only five possible actions on your turn, there is an aweful lot to think about.  The deciscions are juicy and the play really captivated me.  This might be a 10 for me really soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Dull resource manipulation. It does not have the tight gameplay this kind of game needs. You have very little feeling of control and chaos reigns. 

The +2 and +4 camel court cards give control allowing the players who have them to not worry about which resources they have collected and giving them the oppurtunity to screw over opponents. This element seems unbalanced as it is almost up to chance who will get these limited cards in the early game. 

There is also a problem of the rules being so limiting that you can't really go for varied strategies. You are not allowed to horde resources for example. I didn't feel there were many times during the game when I felt I was taking genuine strategic or tactical desicions mostly the best course of action turn to turn was fairly obvious.

Basically an engaging multiple ways to victory-game although the number of ways with which to achieve victory is somewhat small. Players attempt to score the highest amount of points against the backdrop of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Randomly laid-out craftsmen can be hired for ever increasing prices: they allow you to obtain tradable goods, camels, and influence in the temples as well as irrigate canals running through the Gardens. Goods and camels can be traded away for plants which bring you a lot of goodies, but since a plant depends on water brought into the Gardens by irrigation, it is not easy (and quite frankly, impossible) to play your own game and see it through.

I admit I'm rather puzzled why I like this game. For all intents and purposes it [i]should[/i] be rife with multiplayer chaos: absolutely not my favourite mechanism. I think that it has a lot to do with Amyitis' incremental nature and the fact that there is nearly always something sensible for you to do. In other words: players get in each other's way in important areas, but not to the extent that it appears to be decisively crippling. It's this finely tuned balance which sits very right with me: it isn't a game of pure economic growth yet does allow you to develop in a slow fashion; it does have multiple ways to victory, but does allow you to hamper an opponent without too great a sacrifice to your own position; etcetera. It is simply a well-crafted game which provides an interesting challenge in a moderate amount of time.

[b]Update[/b] Even after long breaks, Amyitis remains a strong title with a pleasant playing rythm and finely balanced yet very flexible strategies. One of the few games where the way to the finish is just as enjoyable as the actual finish. Bravo et mes compliments, M. Demaegd!

Caylusesque and therefore very good. I won my first game. I want to play more and rating might go up.

Update: after playing it again, it feels more tactical than strategic. There is more reacting to the current game situation (caravan position, availabe workers), which limits the decision making process to a more near-term planning horizon. Some early choices in the game though will have quite a large impact later on (banker, camel booster).

RATING: 6
Components: There is something off about the artwork for this game. The city board seems unnecessarily busy; the game board has a lot of underutilized space; the gardens don't look lush enough to enhance the theme; the camel tokens should be a different size or shape from the commodity tokens; the gardens occupy less of our time than do the commodity and temple tracks, and so should perhaps be de-emphasized. Overall the art seems to be going for realistic, when I would have preferred fantastic.

Experience: I had an epiphany while playing this game, that I dislike multiple currencies in games. In Amyitis, players must constantly balance their incomes of talents, camels, commodities, and plant cards; each acquired in a different way, and each spent in a different way; it can be dangerous to be left with too few of any of these, and wasteful to be left with too many. This act of balancing is certainly challenging, but I wouldn't call it fun (fun is deciding which cards to spend in Race for the Galaxy). As a result, I experience that sense of just “pushing cubes around”. I felt the same in my recent playing of Lancaster; it's as if either the chosen theme demanded this level of complexity, or competing ideas were grafted onto a simpler game to achieve a desired amount of complexity.

I enjoyed the novel mechanisms of the increasing cost to utilize the profession cards, and in expending camels to move from city to city. I didn't find the action on the main game board as interesting. Thematically, I dislike that we remove tiles from the board as we supposedly build the gardens, and that we end the game with three tiles still on the board; this felt dissatisfying, like we just removed many of the tiles, and then quit before we had actually accomplished anything. I liked the game more upon immediately finishing it than I do now having thought about it more.

My first play was a 3 player game.  I somewhat enjoyed it, but thought it took to long between turns.  It seemed like the other 2 people were taking too long on their turns.  But the others felt the same way, that they were playing faster than the opponents.  So I fear this game just has too much analysis paralysis.  I should try a 2 player game to see how that goes.  The caravan track would not change as quickly, which may make it easier to predict and cause less analysis.

Amyitis is a tough game to plan what you need.  There are three things that are important to do.  All three are difficult.  But all three have ways to them more easily.  The trick is that those advantages are limited.  So each person will have a different set of challenges to overcome.  I liked the way this plays out.  Things are tough without everyone competing for the same resources.  There is also some trickery where players need to out maneuver each other.  There is competition for resources, actions, and bonuses.  It is a puzzler that is worth the time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoyed this quite a bit, but it suffers from some of the issues that more complex euros have. The rules are somewhat unintuitive, which means that unless you play it often you have to relearn it each time. The icons take some getting used to, as does the play on the side board. I always feel that by about half way through the game I'm remembering how to play and starting to develop a strategy, but then we don't play for a year and I forget all of it. Too bad, as it *is* enjoyable, but unlikely to be played often enough to reach its potential.

I'm a little concerned about the power of the master banker and the master camel. Especially in a two-player game, if you don't manage to get at least one of those right away, you'll have no chance to catch up... even though the game will only be 25% or so finished.

You must pay (in the correct form and amount) to advance the rondel, and to do an action when you get there.  The action you perform can be locked out if other players get there first (or advance the rondel too many spaces).  So you can plan, plan, plan, then get stuck with nothing to do very easily.  You can also get locked out of advancement if you miss your opportunity more than (1 minus the number of players) times.   So the screw your neighbor aspect is baked into the game, it will happen every time!

I hate this game.

Similiar to Yspahan.  Even uses camels as a means to convert resources into VPs.  Looks like it has some depth to it.  It appears to be a game where you have to set your strategy pretty early and hope things work out.  Other player's choices can really put a crimp in your strategy...which normally is a good thing. However, in Amyitis, I'm not sure you can adapt your strategy once you set down a road.   Also the theme is weak.  As such, I don't see it going any higher than a 7 for me.  But although I don't really understand what I'm doing, it is still a fun challenge.  I'm looking forward to playing it again.

I was wrong.  I'm liking this game more than I expected.  In fact, I recently suggested it...so this has gone up to an 8.

Players are constructing the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.  Players take turns moving a camel around the communal "rondel", or claiming/paying for a worker from the common pool.  It's all about gathering resources to claim rondel stuff, that lets you construct tiers of the garden.  A typical resource gathering game where you're constantly assessing your options against the other players holdings, complete with upgrades, end of turn rewards and end of game victory point bonuses.  I really need to play this again ... it all worked fine, but I felt I missed out badly by being the player without the camel upgrade ... I was reduced to a spectator and seizing fleeting opportunities for half a game ... never fun.  Very long with four players too.

This is a really nice design.  I especially like how there are truly varied paths to victory.  You can win without getting a single "Court" card.  Such upgrades are essential for victory in most other games of this type, but here they are just tools, and that is very interesting.

Maybe slightly redundant to other games in my collection though?

Some really nice mechanisms, but just a little too many of them. 

I really like the card drafting, the camel track (especially how the caravan tech improves your mobility here), the temples majority, even the irrigation which can be a double edged sword. Each individual part of the game works great, but when you put them all together it's a bit too much to keep track of.

Yes, this is a real gamer's game. Or should we say gamer's gem? So many paths to prestige points, and each path has "screw your opponents" written fat all over it. Every decision is crucial, games usually burn down to a few points advantage for the winner at the end. I love the idea of having resource/advantage paths that not every player can have. Not that this is a new concept, but here it is implemented in a very charming way.

I didn't find this very interesting even though I won. It seemed like a VP fest. Not a game you would want to play with experienced players who know what they are doing. The player at the back gets no advantage. My turn consisted of picking up a card, getting a VP point. The theme was stuck on.

RATING: 7
My first impression after one play: quite an intricate game which is quite bewildering at first glance. I made some good moves at first by sheer luck, and some decent moves later on by intention, and managed a win (4 player - two of the others had played once or twice, so none of us was very experienced at it!). Once you get the hang of how the different aspects interact and make sure you pay attention to the other players' capabilities it makes more sense. Would be happy to play again to try different strategies.

I'd have to agree with the sentiment of one user who said the game feels like you are running against the tide.  While Amyitis certainly works mechanically, it feels like a bunch of mini puzzles thrown together in a fragmentary, disengaging way.  While several long-term strategies appear available to pursue, the game is mostly tactical resulting in a frustrating gaming experience rather than a fun challenge.  Easily my least favorite Ystari game.

Great mid-weight Euro.  I very much like and recommend this game, and think it deserves a better reputation than it has (frankly, I don't get the strong reaction against some people have). Plays well with 2, 3, and 4 and is fun without being too heavy or complicated. 

I like the choices this game offers and the different fronts you have to address.  You need to catch that caravan before it moves past the city you want it to stop in, but there are the more immediate needs of irrigating and establishing a presence in the temples.  The temples are a side game that goes on during the main game and offer a nice turn-order consideration. The way only a subset of the workers you can choose is available each turn is clever as is the way they get more expensive when there are fewer left.  Lots of good things to do here, your job is to prioritize them while anticipating your opponents' incentives. 

In typical Ystari fashion, you're asked to spin several plates at once, the most important being the caravan, and that is the greatest source of tension here. I've won by collecting a lot of temple tiles as well as going for the VP cards when I got knocked out of the caravan tempo for planting. While the worker cards come out randomly each turn, there's always something you can do either for your cause or to block your opponents (e.g., taking temple position, moving the camel just as a blocking move). 

I think this is an underrated gem as far as a medium-weight worker placement game. I don't have much to say on the theme, but the game works for me in a "whole is bigger than the sum of the parts" way.

Once the murky rule book is deciphered, a nice game of resource management with many different paths to victory emerges.

Very abstract game.  I usually feel a bit empty inside when the game ends.  Perhaps there just aren't enough interesting choices.

Wow! There is a lot going on in this game!

It is all about [b]TIMING[/b] in order to score well :

1/ synchronizing yourself between the fields and the caravan (gathering the resources you need to buy what you want)

2/ observing the rythm of the temple (selecting or not the priest given the standing in the temple and who will do the procession)

3/ moving the caravan (straight away in order to gain a benefit before an opponent, later to prevent an opponent to benefit from your move)

There is a lot of [b]INTERACTION[/b] into this game : it is not only to gain PP but also to deny some PP to your fellow opponents. The game allows screwage in a brillant and elegant fashion.

The resource management is very tight and you need to plan carefully because of your storage limit (2 or 4), the tight money (increasing recruitment costs), the tight camels (you always need at least 1 camel to move the caravan even if you have +2 or +4 caravanner). You will find yourself almost all the time in shortage of one money, one camel or one resource.

Court cards are not a goal : their are a means to help you on the road to victory.

Awesome 2 players game.
Best with 3 players IMHO.

Awesome gaming experience !

RATING: 9
This is an excellent strategy game, up there with the likes of PR, Caylus and Goa.  The key element which gives it this prestige is the caravan mechanism, in which the order cities may be visited is semi-predictable.  This adds a lot of order to a game that might otherwise suffer chaos at the hands of the resource, points and currency subsystems.  I need to play more before I can give this a ten - I want to play more so I can give this a ten!

Superb game underneath a somewhat drab presentation.  I owned this game for sometime before actually playing and I had read the instructions several times, each time giving up.  the instructions DO make sense but they aren't formulated or formatted particularly well.
The game itself involves hiring skilled personnel (workers, priests etc) and then performing the relevant action.
victory points are gained by building the hanging Gardens of babylon.

Amyitis is a solid game. It meshes lots of different mechanics into a rather well-integrated whole. The bare amount of "stuff" makes it somewhat hard to explain and seem a bit overwhelming at first but that feeling quickly fades once you actually start playing. While the gameplay isn't quite as complex as it first seems there are still a number of different routes to get points, and it doesn't look like one is inherently superior to another.

Maybe the biggest problem with the game is the amount of control over what is happening on the board. It's quite likely better with fewer players, especially if you get locked out of camels early which pretty much leaves you going after the scraps the other players don't care for.

After one 3 player game a 5 rating is optimistic...my experience was probably more in line with a 3.  I appreciate my failings as to fully grasping what a game might have to offer me after only one play, but the theme and game play seemed poorly connected, the collection of mechanisms seemed contrived (the priest-temple element reminded me of the festival mechanism of Java...a better game would not have either of these elements.)  The "musical chairs" aspect of the caravan board...but ultimately the game might be interesting to play but there isn't much fun to be found here - like a sudoku puzzle perhaps?

An excellent game! There are many ways to win and the strategies are not so obvious as it would seem. There's also a bit of interaction but concentrating on messing with your opponents will exclude you from the game because others just jump off easily.

The theme is rather absent but surprisingly it doesn't bother me much. And the pieces look fantastic which contributes to the gameplay a lot.

Amyitis is a fun, nicely-style game which, having played only twice, I intend to revisit.  It's actions are available using a shared rondel.  This is similar to Antike, except that in Antike each player moves their own piece on the rondel and in Amyitis each player can moves the shared piece (the caravaneer) on the rondel which can strategically set up themselves for future actions or affect the actions to which their opponents have access.  Thankfully, while money is important and getting money and other resources and abilities is essential, there are effectively several free actions (not based on the rondel) which are available.  The game is also rather well balanced so that no one streaks quickly to a commanding lead although in the endgame this would happen from time to time.  All in all, Amyitis is a game which allows players to choose various ways of improving their position and hence their victory points.  Recommended.

I'm not a big fan of completely arbitrary limitations driven only by component count; in Amyitis that limitation is the core mechanic, and the balance of those cards, especially of the 3rd bank card, seems suspect.

Because the (arbitrarily limited) court cards are worth more points than irrigating or building in the garden, most of the game just feels like a trigger you pull to end things after you've won the court card game (or trigger to prevent others from pulling if you have the bank that makes points every turn).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Initial impressions:  Just purchased, only played one 2-player game.  Works well with 2 players.  Seems like a very deep game with relatively simple mechanics which I like.  Typically good quality game and nice theme too.  The randomness of the garden layout is a nice touch too.

Update:  Now played a three player game.  Enjoyed this game as well, and the restricted access to court cards adds a whole new dimension.

Update 2:  Played another three player game and now I am convinced this is a great game.  The fact that several strategies can be equally effective and the subtleness of impacts of decisions makes this game a lot of fun.

In Amyitis you are always vying for control in several different places. Timing means everything as you pay attention to the temples, resource track, caravan, plants, and upgrade cards to make sure you are in position to get what you want, when you want. Try to beat others to the same thing, and know when to let someone else have their points so you can prep yourself for future turns.

Fun game with many tactical and several strategic elements. Great for 2-4 (though I feel like I might prefer this with 3).

Eurogame/Worker placement; the most important things are said now ;-) It's a solid design but sadly not outstanding like Caylus. Even though the game is about soil watering, it's a bit on the dry side.
There are likes but also dislikes like: - No compensation for first player advantage - All developments are upgradeable on several levels, however they are only available to "amount of player minus one", this means one player does not get into a certain development. This can already be decided in the first two rounds. To put up some tension, level one should be available to all, only further up levels should be scarce. Can be fixed with a houserule as long you're not playing with all four players.

Played 3 times. First played at Essen 07. Ystari are becoming a favourite publisher of mine. This game feels well balanced offering different routes to victory. This is essentally an exercise in making the optimum use of every action, getting resources to assist in the the gathering of more resources or purchase of victory points. The rules are easy to grasp and I can't see me needing to refer to them again even if I go several months without playing (these days this is something I hold as a definite plus). I might well raise my rating to a 9 but for now I have knocked off a mark because there is nothing new on offer. This is my favourite game from Essen 07. It plays quicker than Caylus but provides me with a similarly satisfying experience though probably has less replay value. A lovely bonus - This plays nice with 2 players.

Nice touch, and fun to play if one likes strategic euros (which I do). I really enjoyed playing it. Whereas the other "Y" games feel cohesive and centered around one or two, often quite unique, core mechanisms, this feels more like a compilation of disparate reward systems but with a limited set of rewards (mostly VPs that recycle in different ways) while the actual resources, and their differences, play a much less prominent role that e.g. in Caylus.

Played this once more and I still like it, even years later. Other players can ruin your plans if you're ignoring them. You need to have an eye on your opponents as this is more of an tactical than strategical game.

You need good timing aswell as good setups for the next round to get ahead in this game.

Rating 7 is preliminary. Our first play didn't go very well, partly because of some rules questions that were solved during the game. My wife felt she was closed out somewhere in the middle. She never considered that I'd make large jumps with the caravan, going past the city she was going to use.

Another turn the crank, spit out victory points type of game.  Exceptionally well-balanced, even amongst the different strategies.  For what it was, I like it, but this is not my type of game.  The interaction is pretty minimal and the ending was VERY anti-climactic.  Another here are a bunch of mechanics, here are how you make them produce VPs, GO! game.  Theme was pasted on.  Fun game, just not one I would want to play very often.

RATING: 6
Well maybe there is a star structure in there - but then a star without a center. It really feels like unrelated mini games stuck together in the same box.
Some will find strategy behind a grand design, others like me will find that the game is mostly tactical, quite chaotic and without a soul.  A pity for the sexy queen Amyitis and her fabled garden you might say, but the theme is just absent anyway.  Some minor quibbles about the graphic design of the board. The box illustration is very nice.My first Ystari real dissapointment.

edit: Finally has grown on me. I still feel it lacks a real theme, a real direction, but the game is interesting.

RATING: 6
[Initial Impression: 6] The rules are not particularly well-written and hard to follow, meaning we got a few rules wrong the first time through. The game is an interesting resource-management element, but it has so many moving parts that it can be really hard to track them all. It lacks the elegant stream-lining of the other Ystari games, where the moving parts all seem to interlock. Here, and despite the fact that the options are limited on each turn (pass, caravan, or recruit), you're almost overwhelmed with choices: which of several sub-options you go for, the order in which you choose, and how this might affect other's options can mire down beginning players. I'd like to play more, as it was a game I was quite looking forward to, and I do think it would greatly reward further time invested. A poor initial impression with high hopes for repeated plays.

Not only a soulless euro, but also incredible ugly artwork.

You don't have a lot of options on your turn, that makes planing ahead very important.. and that comes along with AP.. turns take ages, and for what?

Juicy, bouncy Victory Points!

Finally pulled this off the shelf and tried it out... and found a competant mid-weight Euro inside.

This one has a small amount of Tech Track (court cards) mixed in with Action Selection (craft cards), but these are also limited by cost (a la Caylus) and by goods (Camels, Commodities).

It seems very easy to miss the one or teo things you need to stay competitive in this game- but nevertheless it is possible to stay competitive without a Banker, or an upgraded Cameldriver, if one makes good choices.

That reflects a nice balance of things in a game, and if I see that in copntinued plays I may raise may score: starting with a 7 on this.  Not a bad game, just a bit long for what it was on my first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game reliance on timing can lead to a game of chicken in the 2 player game. With more, we have a big Left Player Syndrome, not unlike Medina or Samurai. It also doesn't have a strong leader dampening mechanism, so just like in Caylus, games can and should be called early.

 Still, it's good once you get past those issues.

I find the board design to be the most horrible thing this side of Yspahan. Too many saturated colors! The Ystari guys really need to change graphic artists.

Tipikus Ystari játék. Igen összetett, sok gondolkodást igényel. Bár sokszor úgy éreztem, hogy a karavánvezető feltűnése vagy éppen fel nem tűnése a döntő momentum. Hiszen az a lényeg, hogy a kis táblán hogy tudunk haladni, hiszen ott lehet kártyákat fejleszteni és az ültetvényeket szerezni. Persze ehhez teve kell, ami az első templomnál lehet szerezni illetve néhány ültetvényen. Szóval ez a játékban az igazán szűk keresztmetszet.

A bit of majority, a bit of set collecting. This is the kind of level that Knizia got down to in 2005 with designs like Tower of Babel, he's sensibly taken a break from designing 'big box' games, perhaps Cyril Demaegd needs to do the same. In summary: apart from the 'four tiles left' rule that likely ends the game without the big scoring tiles being taken, there's nothing at all wrong with this game, but honestly, what's the point?

Took most of the first play to figure out what I was supposed to be doing here.  Farmers are essential, perhaps a little too important.

1st played 2/7/08. Taught in ~15min, played in ~90min w/ 4 players. Good strategy/luck ratio. Goal: most VP by game end(only 4 planting spots left). Going 1st in a round rotates. Players choose to hire a hand(farmer, gain resource; camel master, gain camel; architect, irrigate & get 2VP; or merchant, place influence in $/camel, VPs, resource) or camel trade(spend camel to move clockwise) or pass(1 coin reward for players who previously passed). Once all pass, round end. Trader options: buy & place plant(flip plant trading post, place in irrigated location for lot rewards, 2-10 VPs & upgrade/etc; place neutral markers for un-irrigated sections), upgrade house(for VPs; 1st is 3VP), upgrade camel house(move 3 trader spaces free), upgrade bank($ @ round start) & sell goods for VPs. All trades require certain good(s). Hands are grouped together in 3 card pools. The 1st 1 taken in each group is free. 2nd=$1 & 3rd=$2. Goods are set by farmer market indicator w/ last being a wild card(use as anything). If you happen to place the most(no tie) farmers in 1 of the 2 tracks, you get a gardener(lets you upgrade plant value by 1). When all pass, dealers right places a merchant cube in 1 of 3 locations and a neutral 1 in other 2, rotate cube down.

Amyitis is based on the theme of building the Hanging Garden. Players mainly have 3 choices to do. The theme and the game are not really matching. Tactically, Amyitis is easy to be unbalanced during the game. The main tactical choices are influenced by how much money and resources that players have. Therefore, the game easily tends to be the rich-get-richer and the poor-get-poorer game. The richer, the more tacitical choices to choose. Playing game time is longer than it is expected. Amyitis is a good game, but nothing special.

Lots of interlocking minigames provide multiple paths to victory...typical of mid-weight Ystari games. The card draw/draft makes this very tactical, but the tactics feed nicely back into overall strategy. The expansion adds a role-selection auction, which is probably ill-advised for new players to use. Not so good with two players...temples too powerful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like it.  It's yet another classic euro, but somehow I find it fresh.  There are different paths to victory, you cannot do everything and you have to pursue streamlined strategies.

The game requires a perfect mix of tactical and strategic plannig.

[In my eyes Ystari has rebuilt its reputation after Yspahan and Caylus Magna Carta]

EDIT: After the 10th game I'm beginning to think that maybe each player should have access to the 1st level caravaneer card. It's so hard to play without it... 
Other cards are not so crucial and you can play with sufficient quantity of them for each player as well as with the deficits.

Maybe one day I'll play with all cards accessible for all players... It could be interesting. 

EDIT 2: OK, I've played enough.  I've had my fun with the game, but now it becomes a repetitive experience.  Time to move on.

RATING: 7
Another good edition to the Ystari line up that looks to scale and play well. Probably just over a middle weight here which is my biggest concern, it does seem to run a little long for that class, middle weights should really be 45 - 90 minutes at most so we'll have to see if the time can be brought down on this (2 hours now). 

Multiple ways to score and potentially win keep it interesting and there are some screwage opportunities as well if your paying attention to the other players. There are a couple of different approaches you can take to the game but certain ones are limited by the cards on purpose so your plan could get thwarted, especially in 4 player.  

Overall the game would of faired much better had it of been the length of Mykerinos, about 60 minutes as it is on par with it in weight class.  As is, I don't see it being requested due to the ROI not being high enough for the time investment. 

Note: maybe the worst cards I've ever seen! For the love of Pete charge an extra dollar or two and give us GOOD cards!

Nice medium-weight euro from Ystari. Players participate in the building of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, using farmers to produce resources, engineers to irrigate the garden's areas, traders to acquire camels (which are used to travel around Mesopotamia getting exotic plants for the gardens) and priests to maintain a presence in the city's three temples. When an exotic plant is bought it is planted in the gardens, yielding VPs as well as other advantages.

With many ways of scoring VPs and with caravan-loads of different, interacting mechanisms in the game, Amyitis is actually quite a nice game, which I have enjoyed playing. It does feel a bit too abstract and a-thematic for my tastes, though, but if you like games like Goa and Caylus, this one should be right up your alley.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2016)

I bought Amyitis on 2014, it took me 2 years to play it because my desire to do so was low, however I’m very happy I finally played it. Amyitis pleasantly surprised me. The name of the game sounds like a disease (and my SO name is Amy ;)).

The theme of the game is ok for me but you don’t feel it thought the game. Amyitis´ components and art are very well done.

The rules are easy to grasp, but they are many. You can explain the game under 20 minutes. 

The game decisions aren’t obvious in any way, just the opposite they are very interesting and tense (should you buy plants?, should you build an irrigation, should you try to get the majority in a temple, should you build a garden?, should you move the caravan?). Every action you do have a huge impact on your game plan and on your opponents, the interaction is very high (although non aggressive, which I like). Timing is also very important. All of these factors make the game very attractive for me, there is a lot going on and I love it!

It seems there are many paths to victory.

I think the game is best with 3 players, but I´m keen on trying it with two players.
 
The one thing that stop Amyitis from being a favorite, is the luck of the cards. Each round some cards will appear and some won´t and that can wreak havoc to your carefully laid plans, furthermore, this makes turn order much more important and I dislike this. Other than that, Amyitis is golden for me.

Bottom line, Amyitis is a medium weight, solid Euro game. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me with more plays. I’m baffled that I didn’t heard about this game before (I bought it as I buy most of my games, without any knowledge whatsoever). I have The Palace expansion and I hope to try it soon. For now, Amyitis is a keeper in my game collection.

Another in the series of, "Reading the rules is much more complicated than playing the game."  There are many mechanics here that interlock and need explanation, but once you're in the game, the flow is very easy to follow.  One play is not enough to see all the subtleties, nor evaluate the apparent paths to victory, but it looks like there are multiple viable strategies which will lend itself to replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you long for a game that has multiple, and I do mean multiple, paths to victory, then Amyitis is for you.

Tight money and tough decisions each and every turn make this game a winner.

I've played multiple times with each number of players and, even though the game scales well for two or three,  you should try to get a full table of four to really appreciate the subtle strategies.

The highest margin of victory I've seen has only been 8 points... you can't get much closer.  Highly recommended.

After more play, my rating has gone from '7' to '8'.

Nice set of choices to be made - use engineers to irrigate, move into the temples, grab a resource, or move the camel.  A lot of points to be had, but not enough actions to carry them all out.  And don't forget to keep a supply of money or you'll be forced to pass very early.

Wow. I've read the criticisms against mid-weight Ystari games many times but never experienced the problem first hand. 

Caylus is thematically intuitive. Everything that's going on makes a lot of sense. Amyitis isn't like that. Amyitis takes several mechanics, throws them together, tries to evoke a theme, and generally only succeeds at being disorienting and abstract. Examples: there are three randomly determined actions available every turn, and the first selection from each is free, the second costs one coin, and the third costs two. If you pass and other players keep going, you get a coin each time it comes back to you. There are a couple of card sequences that you can slowly build up for points or income. I have no idea what they represent. There is yet another action menu on another board on which you spend camel tokens to move to the desired action space. I don't know what that represents either. There are three "tracks" on the bottom of the board that give you rewards for being in first and second. Don't know what those are. There is the garden itself (remember, this game is about The Hanging Gardens) which can be irrigated and planted... each section awards some combination of points, money, and camels. Why? Don't know. The game also ends with the gardens still not completed. Finally there are two resource tracks in which you collect different seeds that can be planted at the gardens (at least I hope that's what's going on). I guess that part makes some sense. 

This game really has to be seen to be believed.

A game can't be more "Euro" than Amyitis, i.e. multiple intertwined mechanisms, only loose connections between theme and actual gameplay, indirect competition with the ultimate goal to use actions in a way to convert resources to VP's most efficiently.
It works perfectly, the rough edges have been flattened and there are various ways to victory. Too bad, that the end result falls a bit flat as well. Scores were so close that it didn't get clear if our different actions mattered much and there wasn't anything worth remembering about our game like a clever play, surprising blunders etc. Still, solid enough that I would play again. The best part about it was that the immediate VP approach could compete with the generic Euro strategy approach of building up the resource engine to generate more VPs in the endgame.

For some reason I was biased against this game previous to playing because of what I perceived to be an obtuse set of rules.  As I was explaining the rules I got a lot of grief for what seemed to be an incongruous and overlong bunch of rules.  I was pleasantly surprised that the game was quite fun and suspenseful, very tight and competitive.  Once you start playing, it is quite intuitive and filled with interesting decisions.  It seems that the money is not too tight, but the competition for resources is pretty fierce.  I look forward to playing this more - so far Ystari still has an unblemished track record with me!

Update: Because of the huge amount of rules, I find myself unwilling to teach this to new players, and at the same time it's difficult to get it to the table with people to whom I've already taught the game.

Sometimes a lot of good ideas aren't as interesting a few ones that harmonize.

This went over well in games played a while ago.  A lot to think about, a lot of options, and the only thing that may have been holding back from real rave reviews was the dry theme.
Another deep release from Ystari, nonetheless....

Bought 080809 at SpeliFocus in Gothenburg, while visiting my brother.

Trying to get this one started with the rulebook had me and my wife frustrated but once we got a few turns in we had one of those "aha!" moments and everything came together.  Instantly became one of my favorite games.  Very original, lots of strategy and very little luck.  You have lots of choices to make when its your turn and you have to balance those choices so you have what you need for your next turn.  Requires you to think ahead and think what the other person/people are going to do next.  I plan on playing this one a lot.

Played twice.  I like this game more than one would think considering I've been completely humiliated in both games.  I think I understand where I went wrong, but it's not totally clear to me yet how to fix it!  There are many options pretty much every turn in this game, but figuring out which are strictly better than the others is not always obvious.  I liked it well enough to play again, but I wouldn't want to overload on this game.

RATING: 7
An OK resource management with something of Santiago (irrigation).  Could be a tad shorter but not too bad.  Suffers from a slow start, the randomness of the actions can really disturb the flow of the game.  For no good reasons, a lot of the people I play with get fairly bad AP on this.  All this combine to create a sense of "meh".  I'd rather play Agricola, le Havre, Santiago, Cuba or even Puerto Rico.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another stellar game from Ystari.  This euro game has a multitude of paths to victory and each path is multi-tier as well.  A splendid game of both offensive and defensive moves that can help yourself while perhaps helping your neighbors too.  Beautiful art and components blended together along with excellent game play consisting of multiple combination of mechanisms makes this a top-notch euro game for me.  It is loaded with options from the beginning and multiple strategy points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is very much your typical Ystari game and if you enjoyed prior titles, you are likely to enjoy this one.  My biggest concern is that while everyone else was playing with some strategy in mind, I managed to win quite handily by just grabbing whatever points I could whenever it was my turn.  I got locked out of the bank after taking a level one bank, locked out of camels totally, and we didn't really pursue the victory point route all that much.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very nice Euro game that integrates a number of mechanics nicely into a system that allows you to pursue a number of different yet viable strategies for victory.  Nearly every action phases is tense with the struggle to maximize your resources, infrastructure and/or points.

First played at a game night in Seattle and bought it soon afterward. I love the thoughtful, strategic atmosphere that gains momentum as the game progresses. I enjoy the element of "there are many roads to victory" in games, and this one has it in spades, in a very well balanced way. Players' strategies are intertwined enough that you still want what your opponents are going for often enough, but it's clear you're all looking at different elements of the game that will be of particular benefit to you. I like the diversity involved, and that on others' turns there's always something going on that you'll want to pay attention to.

It took several reads to get the hang of how the game works.  In learning it, it was very difficult to see how it worked together.  In playing, it was difficult to get all the parts of the game together in my head.  We had some similar issues with the lay-out of cards and the board, making it a somewhat frustrating experience.  In theory, I'd like to play it again, to see if now I have played it once, I think I could have better control over my fate.  The first game has soured it though.

UPDATE: we did try a 2nd game and it was much better. Raised rating to a 7.

This game may seem very chaotic at first, but once you get all the ways to score points, it's actually quite fun. Also plays very well with 2 players. Nice game material. But the game rules could be better. I've noticed that for some reason, women like to play this game better than men.

It's quite amazing how the rules threaten you with a daunting amount of complexity and are then belied by the actual gameplay, where all the different things you can do gels together. We did manage to get at least one rule wrong, nevertheless, but this did not impair our very favorable impression.

Since it also works very nicely as a 2 player game, I'm very glad to have this in our collection.

Very nice game where timing is everything.  A typical Ystari production, the components are excellent, and once you have all the little nuances of a turn down, play procedes quickly.  Even first time players can pick this one up in a relatively short time, which is a big plus.  I've yet to figure out a winning strategy, but will eagerly play it again to work on that.

Great Euro--a few paths to victory, but you're not overwhelmed with options on each turn.  The theme is tied in with gameplay well enough that it actually helps the mechanics make sense and helps the game flow.  An interesting twist on area control, shifting out those who played there furthest back, so timing becomes very important.

Received June 3, 2008

What is this thing?  The written rules are horrible.  On a whim, I took a chance to pick up a copy of this to fill out an order and I should have read through the rules first (damn geekbuddies :-).

The game feels like there's a something buried in there but during playtesting they kept adding mechanics to offset design flaws.

The collection of actions are completely disconnected from the theme and there are so many fiddly things to do at each phase that I can barely make sense of them.  

Putting this "gem" up for trade.

If you enjoyed Caylus, you will likely enjoy this - and if you didn't enjoy Caylus, you should give this a try!  Though the gameplay is not that similar to Caylus, the attention to detail, the challenging decisions, the excellent quality components, and overall well designed game-play make this a very fun game.  Oh, and points for the odd name too.

Although I like this game, it is not nearly as heavy as I expected from reading BGG comments.  Then again, I haven't played it nearly enough, so it might improve.  I did see that different strategies worked nearly equally well.  One player adopting banker, another choosing court cards, one developing tiles, and another irrigating all finished within six points of one another.  It occurs to me that you could start one strategy and play it until the point where you could lock a player out of the other strategies and then pursue your own.  I'm not sure if that would work or not.  What the game basically seems like to me is a three-way area control game with the priests, the gardens, and the resources all being contested.  There are other subgames as well, but all the pieces interact.  Probably you can tell that I'm still figuring it out.  My 8 initial rating is from just 2 games.

RATING: 8
When rating optimization/economic games I'd put a high weighting on theme integration. I think Amyitis failed in this area. Anyway I don't mind to play it again as there are a lot of interesting mechanics to play with, especially compared to other optimization games released recently.

RATING: 6
Played three-player five times, and four-player twice. A medium weight resource management game, that seems to take longer than it should. I wasn't bored, but I sure wasn't on the edge of my seat either.  I'm sure I'll be playing it again. But I've seen this type of game done better. I'd call Amyitis only slightly above average. Oh, and I think they shouldn't have used blue as a player color. When I see blue cubes in an irrigation game I automatically think they represent water (canal extensions). Nope, bizarrely they used gray for "water". Also, the cavavan chit using the same graphic as the camel chits could be confusing. Why the caravan didn't have its own unique graphic (eg. a standing camel, or two camels) seemed strange, especially since their colors were so close (one is tan and the other dusty rose).

590 avant JC. Nabuchodonozor, roi de Babylone, épouse la splendide Amyitis, fille du roi des Mèdes. Mais la belle se languit de son pays à la végétation luxuriante. Pour elle, le roi décide donc de faire ériger de splendides jardins suspendus. Ainsi, la ville se prépare à relever ce formidable défi, qui marquera les siècles de son empreinte...

Les joueurs incarnent des nobles babyloniens en quête de prestige. Tout au long de la partie, ils tentent d'élever leur statut, en construisant les jardins et leur réseau d'irrigation, en commerçant et en recrutant. A la fin du jeu, le joueur ayant le prestige le plus élevé remporte la partie.

Eredeti mechanizmusokkal tarkított vérbeli euro játék. Ami a dizájnt illeti, az tipikus Ystari (Demaegd). Magyarul ritka ronda (szerintem). Kiadnák újra, igényes dizájnnal, szerintem vevő lennék rá.

Merthogy.

A játék alapvetően tetszik, bár első játék után úgy érzem, kicsit túltolták. Nem elég elegáns, ezerféle mechanizmus, két tábla, folyamatos pontszámolgatás mindenért.

Szóval jó-jó, de letisztultabb játékmenettel és dizájnnal lehetett volna még fokozni a játékélményt.

UPDATE: Több játék után már kevésbé érzem macerásnak a játékmenetet, minden simán, gördülékenyen megy, pontszámolgatás sem veszélyes, bár tény, hogy valóban nem a legelegánsabb. Megérdemli a magas pontszámot, még úgy is, hogy "randa".

RATING: 7.5
Probably one of the least appealingly named games ever? Anyway, an interesting and meaty game with a bunch of different mechanics going on: several rows of card offers, two rows of fields to harvest from, irrigation and planting actions, a roundel for buying and selling stuff. and three temples with separate queues. It takes a while to see how they all integrate, and I definitely haven't figured out the best route(s) to victory yet. Interesting, not an immediately appealing game, but one which has grown on me. Drags a bit with 2 players.

RATING: N/A
You need three primary things to advance the game: to irrigate the gardens, resources to purchase plants to put in the gardens, camels to move on a caravan track which eventually takes you to places which sell said plants. The camels come out 1 or 2 at a time [in a 2p game], and the resources 2 or 3 at a time [in a 2p game].

That means you're mostly figuring out other things to do while you're busy building up everything you need to actually do anything [plant stuff] over multiple [2, 3, more] rounds of play.

There is a minor majorities / positional precedence game driving the acquisition of a single additional camel and single additional resource per turn, otherwise it's all down to the "flop" of action cards at the beginning of each round... and you can bet players are going to get in each other's way as in any decent WP game.

It also seems like it could have a tendency for players not adequately assessing their position vis-a-vis the other players and not actively working toward the game end when they are ahead.

Or, potentially worse [and potentially more likely in a multiplayer game], the possibility for the winning player not to be engaging in the portion of the game that ends the game, and the losing players intentionally keeping the resources away from the winning player preventing them from shifting focus into that area.

That would be a weird effect, and I imagine that the game could stall out for quite awhile if the players collectively acted so as to do it, sort of like the Phase 2 stall in poorly played Power Grid.

Some good ideas are here, but it seems [from my Geekbuddy comments at least] that a lot of players feel the game is too constrictive of player options. I can see how you could come away feeling that. I imagine it's worse in a multiplayer game. The camels were the primary bottleneck in our game, but clearly any card could be.

This really wasn't anything like I was expecting. It's a game of shockingly paltry means, more than any similar resource Euro I can think of. Controlling timing of your resource->VP is also quite difficult.

It seems like a good mechanical [as well as the obvious thematic] fit with Yspahan and Assyria, but even tighter of a system than either of those [which I already consider difficult, small-gains tactical games]. There is the same sort of interaction between two or three primary areas of contention which continually reset / shift.

I didn't quite "get" this game the first time I played it.  By the second play (UK BayCon 2008) I was fully appreciating it.  Very well designed and "together" kind of a game with lots of roads to victory.  I suspect this may get played a lot in our group.

Nothing particularly groundbreaking here; just a solid, middleweight Euro. Maybe goes on a little long for what it is, which is why my rating isn't higher, but otherwise a pretty flawless experience. Got shifted out of my collection due to lack of space. It's a fine game, but it doesn't stand out enough to make me want to play it that often. Really neat visual of building the Hanging Gardens though.

RATING: 8
To me, perfect player interaction balance is where the players can influence each other without losing control (i.e. neither multiplayer solitaire, nor multiplayer chaos). Of all the worker placement games I've played, Amyitis is one of the best in this respect.

The players compete through several mechanisms (craftsmen/action selection, resource/set collection, trade/rondel routes, area/temple majorities, irrigation/route connection, and acquisition of powerful but limited cards), all of which are known and available to all players each round and hence possible to predict and prepare for. Yet, the different mechanisms blend seamlessly and in a very thematic way.

In addition, Amyitis manage without the traditional "money/victory points switch" and "engine building". Instead, the players constantly struggle to maintain a balance between money, camels, resources and long-term investments in powerful cards to earn victory points and keep their engines moving at all. 

Each player decision opens or closes opportunities for the other players as the Wonder of the Hanging Gardens piece by piece come true. 

I fully agree with cymric, whose comment drew my attention to this sadly forgotten gem: "Players get in each other's way in important areas, but not to the extent that it appears to be decisively crippling. It's this finely tuned balance which sits very right with me: it isn't a game of pure economic growth yet does allow you to develop in a slow fashion; it does have multiple ways to victory, but does allow you to hamper an opponent without too great a sacrifice to your own position."

Players are constructing the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. You can move camels to move up on three different levels of abilities: banking, camel or pyramids.  You can use actions to irrigate a canal, place priests in temples or gain camels. The gardens themselves can hold plants of four different levels and higher plant qualities requires exta gardeners. 

There are a lot of things going on in this game. The ability levels are limited, so not everyone can go up on all the paths.  You can't do everything, so you might fall behind in some areas, such as planting. It's a decent game, and I'm still uncovering the nuances of the game.

Quite a fun game that bears aesthetic, mechanical, and conceptual resemblance to Tzolk'in, but it's much less brain-burny. The organization of the rules is rather atrocious; I wish there were a video! One gameplay layer is trying to keep afloat in all three types of currency (money, camels, and resources); the next layer is which of the many routes to victory to focus on. Just writing about it makes me want to play again!

First impression (3 players): Lots of things that are well done but there is something missing from being excellent.

Playtested. "Classic" in mechanisms (give a lot the feel of an Ystari's touch), original in the pace of the game (create opportunities to score, with short times to procede). I enjoyed a lot my last sessions with the final version (and a memorable and tense 3-players session). Very tactical game where you need to invest "at the limit" to succeed (not too much of this, not too much of that).

RATING: 9.5
A stunner. Beautiful in both its design and appearance. It lives up to the monumental premise and does so with applomb. The mechanics allow for multiple options of play, multiple paths to victory, and always interesting choices. Mot of those choices are inter-related, making for a tense and interesting game session. This is a near classic that the designer has clearly put his heart and soul into, and it shows. Well worth the price.

Very solid - you'd expect nothing less from Ystari - and there are lots of subtle strategy paths to take. But the rules are fussy, the theme risibly weak, and the random card deal and rondel combined can be very frustrating. It is unobjectionable enough to get more plays, but is also a classic case of what might have been.

Solid Euro design, getting resources via cards and spending them on the board for VP's more efficiently than the others. It offers multiple paths for VP acquisition, and seems balanced, indicating success will normally mean doing what others aren't doing - with the caveat that it seems all viable paths first require resource chips, which are always the first cards taken and so there's a "who's the start player this turn" luck dependency. Enjoyable, but each turn does seem much the same as the last.

An interesting combination of a number of good mechanics, but ultimately the game was a little on the dull side.

I'd like to play some more to figure out what's really going on.

An area control Eurogame, where players assume the roles of royal gardeners, aiming to plant the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and earn the favor of Queen Amyitis. The game offers:

- Clever mechanism that offers a handful of limited, but tough choices in your turn. Will you irrigate the gardens, take the wildcard resource or probably acquire that much-needed camel token?

- A theme that is very nicely integrated with the game. Although not a thematic game, it's one Eurogame where its theme is congruent with the game mechanism: you really feel panting the gardens and trading with the nearby cities of Mesopotamia.

- High player interaction and strategic depth. You constantly have to monitor what your opponents are doing and even try to deduce their next moves. "Should I move the camel and trade, before my opponent moves it and picks my precious spot?" "I want to irrigate that tile and plant it at a later turn; but can my opponents steal it from me?" 

You may even find yourselves contesting for the majority of irrigation cubes around a tile, to gain that extra bonus. This is a mini concealed warfare; Carcassonne lovers will like it.

- A lot of different ways to accumulate Victory Points, about 5-6 in-game, which offer a great strategic depth. There's also additional end-game scoring, which might also alter the balance of the game.

Gameplay lasts about 90 minutes, but the first games may go up to two hours. I'd recommend it as a main event game.

Definitely the best of Ystari games!

There are so many things to do in this game and you can do most of them. The good thing is that every decision seems to be a meaningful one. Even if you pass you'll get money depending on another players. So no wasted turns anymore. Well, only if you build water canals into totally weird places, maybe then, but otherwise no wasted turns.

Luck is involved in this game in the form of those "action" (or something) cards. On every turn you draw nine and arrange them into three three-card piles. First card of a row is free, second 1 money and third 2 money. So, you'll be having some tough decisions to do since this area is highly under player interaction.

Moving caravan is the basic element of the game which will give you the most points. You need camels to move the caravan, and after moving you pay the price to do the action in the destination place. You either planted a plant into the garden or received a money/VP card. 

No any personal hidden info is present. Good, since in Yspahan, the cards didn't work.
And yet again the thing in all Ystari games: those who have played before will most likely win the game. Well, it's not always a bad thing but can be frustrating for newbies. Personally, I find Amyitis worth the following plays.

Definitely the gem of Ystari!

Interactive, but somewhat disjointed game. On your turn you take one small action, a tiny step towards victory points. On the way, you can get blocked at every turn by the other players, so it's hard to look very far ahead. You might place a cube in a temple (if that action is still available), which may give you a camel (if you have the majority and others haven't kicked you out) at end of turn, which combined with a certain good (if others haven't taken it) on a certain spot on the board (if others haven't made it unreachable) will give you a card that gives you 1 money each turn, which can be used to buy an extra action. Or you combine one or two goods, a gardener card, some camel tokens and some engineer cubes to build a plant in the Hanging Gardens (oh yeah, that's the theme of the game), giving you (and possibly others) points, and maybe a bonus too.

It's not THAT chaotic, since you can see the options available to the other players, but it's very, very hard to see which of the multiple paths available to you is the most profitable. I usually love that, but Amyitis lacks a sense of direction. It's easy to feel quite helpless, where you don't know how well you're doing, and what you need to do to improve your position. So you take another small action, and hope it pays off in the end.

I would possibly love it more, if I played it more. The game probably deserves it, since there's plenty that I like, but there are just so many games out there which are just as fun and a lot easier to get into.

Played twice. I know the designer and the lead playtester and I know they are obstinate and very involved in what they do. So I'm convinced that this game is very well playtested and that it works as it is designed to do. Nevertheless, I don't like the game. I find it frustrating because I can't never do what I wish. The game is essentially tactical and the players must adapt to the circumstances, and the elements of the game are rather in harmony with the theme. That sounds good but the result is not funny, and not captivating, too abstract and overly convoluted for my taste.

Mainly a machanics game, less thematic than Caylus, the game that it has been compared with mostly. The material is good looking. The rules are clear and the rulebook is effective and well illustrated. The game seems to be very balanced when using the different strategies. If you are comparing it to Caylus, you will be disapointed. But set aside the comparaison and you'll find a good typical eurogame.

Principalement un jeu mécanique et moins thématique que Caylus à lequel on le compare. La matériel est beau. Les règlements sont claires et le livre des règlement est efficace et bien illustré. Le jeu semble bien balançé en utilisant différentes stratégies. Si vous le comparez à Caylus, vous serez désapointé. Mais autrement, vous découvrirez un bon petit jeu européens.

I've only played this once.  Although everything seemed to work, and the various parts seemed to balance well, what they didn't do for me was to mesh - either in form or in function.  I felt that the board and component design was overly fussy, and the various different things going on at once felt fussy too.  Overall, I was most worried about how much control a player really had in a 4-player game.

Now this is very much a *personal* reaction to the game - there may well be a very good game in the box, but it's just not one that *I* enjoy.  I had a similar reaction to Ys (it's a very good game of it's type; it just happens to be a type that I hate) and Ysphahan (I like my dice games to be simpler and less cluttered).  Not a game that I would want to buy (or even play again).  Your mileage may vary considerably, however.

I really enjoyed this game. I have only played a couple of other Ystari games, but I can see that the mechanics appear to be taken from their other games. 

The only real downside I see in the game is that a player can be really screwed if they don't get in on the bonus cards, they can be out of the running, especially the money card.

Lots of options, lots of player interaction, tough choices to make, rarely obvious.  Played by the 'wrong' rules on card selection the first time, and I think that might even make it a better game, but it's a great game played either way.

Ystari games always click into place for me, despite (or perhaps because of) the similarity of mechanics in their games. I love this one, there's some decent risk taking in your tactical choices. Plays out a little like Caylus. Everything works, however need to play more.

I like that there are a variety of strategies to choose from in Amyitis.  Since it's possible for the other players to block you out of your chosen strategy, it's good that there are other strategies to consider.  I like the varied options for earning points, as well as the different ways for earning money.  A good player is one who controls what the other players are doing in addition to controlling their own game plan.  Adapting when a player steals blocks you out of certain paths is important and what makes Amyitis fun.

Another very good, multi-paths to victory, game from Ystari. This one themed around building the hanging gardens of Babylon.
As usual with their games, what seems quite daunting at first is actually quite straight-forward, but also requires a good ability to adapt as the game progresses.

RATING: 7
A fun game. For those who care about theme (I usually don't), I found Amyitis to be a loose collection of mechanics that had little to do with the theme of the game (which is about building the Hanging Gardens of Babylon). There are several small area-majority systems, all a bit different from each other, as well as a card draft and a circular track where users can pay to move a camel to accomplish things at different points on the track. The result is an engaging and apparently well-balanced game, offering multiple paths for making progress. Most of us were playing for the first time, and our different approaches to the game yielded competitive scores.

RATING: 7.1
This Ystari game is a bit more complex than Yspahan, but reasonably so.
We were initially impressed by the mecanics of this game, as you are asked from the get-go to make difficult decisions on where to "spend" your energy and resources. However, I found that as long as you always make your actions count, you should be happy when the end comes, even without an overall "strategy".
Definitely, this is the type of game that requires several plays before becoming a "master".

This game is not bad, and there are lot of interesting choices. The game seems to have sufficient depth and complexity and there's likely many different paths to vicotry.  However, the game is completely inelegant. The different parts of the game don't interact well at all.

RATING: 8.25
Heavy Euro with a lot going on, including a very interesting resource placement mechanism that enables you to "push" resources belonging to other players off of a space when bidding to gain majority in that space. Resource collection for delivery and tile collection for victory points. Funds and movement capabilities are huge limiting factors, therefore players who don't develop in these areas early on will have a hard time keeping up. Multiple paths to victory. Complex but underrated and fun.

This game has a so much space at the beginning to chose.  Played two player with two completely different strategies and the game was close.  We both thought we were going to lose (i got nipped a the end).  I think the main component of the game is resource management but I'm not sure.  It's just such chaotic fun.  Great game and can't wait to break this out again....If I have time that is, because this is a game that can cause some analysis paralysis with some people so I can see going long with some people. Our first game was about 2 and a half hours.

RATING: 8
Overall, Amyitis is an elegant, slow burner of a game, and has a lot of appealing aspects. Shame about the graphic design, though, which can easily turn off a few picky players. It is point salad-like, but not quite. Though I can't really stomach those (sorry Feldians), I dig it here. Amyitis makes you to reach for your rewards, and it does so without overwrought manipulation of dice (there are none) or elaborate conversion chains. In this game, rarely do you find a one-to-one action-to-reward relationship; instead it takes sharp planning and critical observation of the positions of your opponents to set yourself up for a big scoring effort. This is a game where you can, and should attempt to, profit from others' efforts. Yes, Amyitis falls squarely into the coveted land of [Euros With Significant Player Interaction], an increasingly rare commodity in modern eurogames. This is made possible because the mechanisms present are all clearly designed for players to 'piggyback' on each other. 

The garden is a shared space. However, the garden tiles cannot be planted unless they are irrigated, and those irrigation spots are competed over. The caravan track is shared, and so it is possible to waylay a player's plans by re-positioning the camel there. Likewise, you may be unwittingly setting another player up for a strong position on the track while driving your own agenda, and you MUST always be cognizant of that possibility. Other majority scoring and placement bonuses are littered across the board (the end-of-round temple re-balancing act is particularly clever). The "technology" upgrade cards are all openly up for grabs, and if you miss out on lower tiers you are locked out of the upper tiers for the remainder of the game. The recruitment actions available each turn are both variable and limited, and it is not merely a question of being able or unable to take an action, but also having to pay more to take said action--and money. is. tight. 

One thing is clear, you simply cannot do all of these things alone! That is where the interaction comes in. For instance, if you decide to deploy the garden irrigation team, you risk someone snatching up bonuses for irrigated tiles for themselves (providing you minor compensation). If you decide to travel along the caravan, you will need resources, but resource availability is tied to timing of placements on the resource track, and obtaining what you needed has no guarantee that you will necessarily be in precisely the right place at precisely the right time to use it (and vice versa). Contingency planning, then, becomes the name of the game. It is all so very interesting, and almost effortless, to see how the mechanisms simply click.

The give-and-take here among players is not so obvious or heavy-handed. Instead, you can place subtle barbs here and there that make other players squirm, or light a small flame that starts to warm your opponent's seat--left unchecked, these barbs may soon become sharp, decisive cuts, or the flames may be stoked into a spreading fire that has gone too far to control. The end result plays out brilliantly and stands out as a truly interactive and strategic experience.

I think this game just overwhelmed me ... I read the rules for folks to play and I think I just keep getting side tracked by all the nesting of actions and this affecting that, etc.  I never stepped back and saw the game as a whole mechanism, but just all those convoluted parts which made it hard for me to see how to score.  I'd like to try it again sometime.

RATING: 7.5
and more camels from Ystari!!Kind of a big brother to Yspahan and big Sister to Mykerinos. Simple choices that lead up to doing something for victory points - little by little it adds up. Not a tremendous game in aspects to play-it-again, but not a shelf-warmer either; it will get played. Probably better with more than 2. Worth keeping until another Ystari game pops up that scratches the same itch. Where Yspahan was easy to know what to do Amyitis is also that way, but where Yspahan had pretty much the same route for everyone in trying to score points, Amyitis has multiple paths. Lots of little ways to gain stuff, just be aware of them all. New mechanisms that make it a fresh game, but not terribly deep mechanics overall. I liked it. Traded off Yspahan after I got it; Same itch.

RATING: 4
The mechanics, taken individually, are quite promising, somewhat novel, and fairly pleasing.  But they do not come together.  The game functions fine, but there are a host of emergent irritations that undermine strategy and fun.

Goods are far too hard to acquire, making the game drag on and introducing luck about who is first player when the are finally introduced into the draft.  When they do enter, you have little choice over which type you get.

The caravan is ok early in the game, but it quickly bogs down too, if nobody has the goods needed to trigger stuff in the near future.  Investing in caravan motion is a mistake, since it helps others almost as much as it helps you (by unlocking the board) and gives up a valuable alternative investment early in the game.  Worst of all, it introduced a lot of unpredictability, undermining the ability to plan turn-to-turn.

The topology of irrigating is largely irrelevant.  It's almost just a free area majority, where you are occasionally don't have a choice.

The workers market is neat in theory, but in practice it means that the best stuff goes for free, the middle stuff sometimes goes for 1, and the worse stuff fails to sell at 2.  It does not serve the role of a market in that it does not price valuable stuff highly.  Instead, it serves as a draft where seating order is twice as important., as the early bird get the worm and pays less for it.  This just means that almost every turn everybody starts by taking free stuff, which removes choice and adds seating-order-based randomness into the game.

Lastly, getting anything done in the game takes many steps, involving waiting for others to take their turns inbetween, any one of which might be unavailable to you due to unpredictable actions or poor draft draws.  So, even making mundane progress on building the garden is frustrating rather than satisfying.

All of the mechanics in this game should be reused, but not in this combination!

Amyitis: The Palace Promo
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
14-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Amyitis is not a bad game, but it's dry and abstract. In it, you try to score VPs by planting (the most difficult) parts on the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. 

Rounds are quite easy. You first get income based on Bank cards you could have bought (0/1/2/ 2+2vp). 

You can take several actions in your turn, based on a random assortment of actions available. There are 3 actions you can get this way (farmer, temple, irrigation, camel-guy). The Farmer gives you a resource that you can trade for stuff you want. The Temple gives you a cube in one of the temple tracks, that gives you something you want if you have a majority. The irrigation is interesting, you have to irrigate the 'garden' place you want to build, before you can plant on the tile.

The camel card gives you just a camel. Those camels you need to walk around the world, getting plants, VP cards or extra income. Camels in that way symbolizes that you walk around the E&T region on a camel getting palaces (?, you get VPs), banks (?, income), plants (thematic) and more camels (travel). 

I don't hate the game. It's dry and soulless, I think. But I don't mind it occasionally. The downside is mostly that the game is UGLY as sin.

Played a 3 player game to 3/4 completion. My tentative rating of a 6 is mot likely to change. There are some great mechanics in this game, but there are also some I'm wary of. I have a strong suspicion you can get locked out of certain actions. It's especially painful to get locked out of priest actions early on, if one or two players can monopolize the temple track, it's tough to compete with that advantage. Components are of good quality, but the artwork seems slightly bland.

So far this has been one of my favorites of the 2007 Essen bunch. The rules seem somewhat confusing in the beginning but it all makes sense. This is one of those games which has very helpful icons on the cards and the board. The graphics are a bit drab and reminiscent of the other Ystari games namely Yspahan and Caylus. The theme fits well and works very well. It's interesting to see how previously we collected victory points but nowadays everybody collects 'prestige'. I wonder what's next? :-)

Yet another game in which players mainly place workers to perform an action or receive a benefit, path of the camel appart.

Blerch.

First, there's the usual awful Ystari rulebook. Also, the graphics on this just suck. Shouldn't the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon be a bit more...beautiful? "Ah...I've removed this drab, ugly slab to reveal a slightly brighter monochromatic plant. Aren't these Gardens magnificent?"

It seems there are multiple paths to victory, but I wonder if that's a false illusion of control. The truth is it's entirely tactical, and your choices are fairly obvious due to the cards that come out. In one round we had only one "Camel guy" come out, which left 3 of us up the creek. The pass mechanic is supposed to put the pressure on the other players to end their turns, but if there aren't good cards for you to buy, why do I care how much money you've got?

I'm just not seeing the greatness of the Ystari games--their popularity is inexplicable to me.

Interesting mixture of interconnecting sub areas with the ultimate goal of supplying resources to plant in the Hanging Gardens. There are 5 sub areas of control during play, with the planting aspect the most complex. This is  because of several resources and items needed to be in place before you can complete this action. The temple areas also give the most interaction against players to gain rewards in these areas (a lot of pushing in this area for control).

Fairly heavy game, about the same as say Power Grid, but not as heavy as say El Grande.

Amyitis --  Played once; four-player.  Seemingly disparate mechanisms mesh well and provide balance, while action choices are appropriately limited.  Planting may award benefits to other players (through irrigation bonuses, for example).  Obversely, Irrigation may allow others to reach [i]your[/i] Planting goals.  Choosing one action often means sacrificing an equally desirable option.  The components are attractive (though camel and coin tokens should have had shapes different from the resources).  Furthermore, a player's moves definitely affect those of the other players.  The various paths to earn victory points invite players to speculate about possible strategies:  To pursue Point cards and Coin cards? Or maybe Irrigation and Camel cards?  To...

A very nice game with tons of paths to explore. It's one problem is that certain cards are critical and only a few are available each round, leaving certain players screwed if they are dealt up unevenly. To solve this, allow an unlimited number of any card to be bought for 3 coins a pop.

Buen juego con varios mecanismos (colocación de trabajadores, comercio, construcción) y bastante sabor histórico. Sin dados, se escogen cartas que permiten diferentes acciones. No se interactúa con los oponentes y todos los citados mecanismos son fáciles, la estrategia es optimizarlos entre sí para lograr la mayor cantidad de puntos posibles. Hay 5 tipos de artículos, 4 clases de trabajadores y el dinero que no se utiliza mucho (se comercia con trueques). En 2 horas o menos debería finalizarse una partida y funciona mejor a 3 ó 4 jugadores. 
Sin llegar a ser un "quema-cerebros" su sistema variado e intuitivo resulta bastante seductor.

Tipikus Y-os játék. Nekem az Assyria hangulatát hozta és nehézségben is ugyanolyannak éreztem. Nem könnyű, de szerintem egy játék után már jól játszható játék. A játékosok babiloniakat alakítanak, akik a szépséges úrnőjük segítségére sietve az uralkodó kérésére kertet építenek a sivatagban, hogy otthon érezhesse magát. Sokféle pontszerzési lehetőség, mégis szerintem átlátható a játék, nem éreztem, hogy túl nagy lenne a szabadság és ne tudnék jó lépést választani, mert tulajdonképpen mindegyik jó valamennyire a körben. Jól kitalált a passzolási mechanizmus, ami pénzt hoz a korán passzivitásba vonulónak és nagy ötlet a körben utolsó játékosnak járó papi jutalom is. Jól kiegyenlített a játék, keresztbe tenni nem lehet igazán a másiknak benne, csak elvenni jó lehetőségeket, ezért nem az erősen konfrontatív játékok közé tartozik. Ahogy az Assyriánál is írtam, még ennek is emelkedhet a pontszáma, de elsőre kezdjünk egy jó erős 7-essel.

Ugh, contains everything that is abhorrent in the modern Euro: Pasted on theme, abstract mechanism whose sole purpose is to score, drafting to give the illusion of choice, now throw in arbitrary set collection and area majorities.  Even as a fan of the genre I see how little regard this game has of anyone looking for anything more than a random dry abstract.  Of course this plot of land gets you the ability to move a camel two extra spaces and two prestige points.  Of course, being in charge of the temple of Ishtar is going to give the first player a Camel and the second a coin.  Outside of the real problems that this game has it just exemplifies what is being mocked in current designs.

From a design standpoint it fails on the most basic level in that the game is reliant on cards to come out fairly evenly for the game to actually progress.  If the cards clump (as statistics will prove that numbers do) you will get a game were you may not be able to irrigate, or get goods. Without these things coming out fairly frequently the game crawls at a snails pace.  There is already so much friction infused into the design, a back run on the card draw will make this game unexceptionably slow.  Often there are turns where you have nothing worthwhile to do and the answer to this would be to pass and make money to speed the game along, but if you already have more money than you could ever need what the hell are you supposed to be doing?

This game is completely tactical.  There are certainly concepts of what strategies are supposed to be but it is just impossible to plan for anything.  You can try to plan a few moves ahead, but even that is subject to the caprice of other players.  The action in this game is so diluted that any action that you'd like to take requires so little thought yet it consumes a huge amount of motions for anything to really find its way into fruition.  It feels like running in the tide.  

The game feels like it is still in the playtesting process. It just isn't tight enough yet.  If you went through the entire deck before reshuffling the cards you could at least insure that the game would move along.

Then there is the art.  Nothing screams the lushest of the great wonders of the ancient world like a computer generated grid.  The art is stiff, the colors ugly and the font difficult to read.  The only thing that worked was the commodities, the rest of the game is awkwardly colored and artificial. Why put an orange font on an orange background?  Why not put cities in the cites?  There was even lots of room on the board to make the temple cha-cha lines more incorporated into something like temple art, instead it is flat and clinical (although quite representational of the rest of the game).

Well, it had to happen some day, Ystari has finally put out a read turd.

I find this to be a lighter version of Caylus, with a bunch going on.  Plenty of decisions to be made, as you decide whether or not to use a camel, choose a card, or pass and gain some money.  This may move up to a 9 with further play.

Another good game from Ystari! A mostly tactical resource managament, VP-engine building game.

After initial play: interesting mix of several mechanisms to earn VP, that all connect with each other. There seem to be multiple paths to victory that are well balanced: VP from irrigating, from upgrading income or your palace, from investing in the temples, and from caravaning. The action selection action is kind of like Caylus but backwards: instead of paying more to choose an action (place workers) after people pass, those who pass now earn money from the bank as long as you continue taking actions yourself. It works very well! The temple mechanism, which keeps cubes moving at the end of every turn, also works quite well; it forces you to pay attention to all areas of the board.

There are so many rules here I thought I'd need a doctorate in order to remember them all while playing, but the gameplay itself is surprisingly easy and I caught on quickly.  It features the classic Eurogame conundrum of many tempting choices and only a few actions.  Most Ystari games have a similar feel to me.  In fact, I think I could guess it's an Ystari game without looking at the box.  That's usually a good thing.  I'm not sure what the optimal strategy is here, but I would like to play again to try and figure that out.

Amyitis is a game that is typical for Ystari: many mechanics and ideas blended, without any proper them to bind them together. So, I was somewhat suprised that it appeared to be a decent game overall. Nothing to blow you away like Caylus might do, but still a game I'd be happy to play some more. It remains to be seen if it can get past 10 plays, but then again, even some games which I find great took a long while to get there.

Based on single play-through this rating may go up.  The balance is tight between several different paths to victory, all of which can be mixed and matched in various ways...that's pretty darn cool.  Lots of player interaction as various actions can be cut-off from further development.

I'm definitely interested in the 2-player game as well since both my wife and I enjoyed the 3-player game so much.

Honestly I can't understand why some of Ystari's games feel some kind weird. This is not an exception, some of its gameplay is unnecessary complicated and definitely has some
Of the most ugliest graphics ever made for a game!!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another typical Ystari point salad and a textbook example of why "worker placement" is a stupid name for action drafting. Instead of placing workers, actions are chosen from sets of three cards. Using a card flips it over to show a coin, the new cost of taking an action from this set. The second action costs one coin; the third, two.

The point of these actions is, broadly speaking, to collect resources ahead of the next game phase, which is to move the caravan around the rondelicious city board and take additional actions there. Moving the caravan requires camels, and taking most actions while there requires goods. There are a few ways to score points ("paths to victory") but the most important is the hanging garden board, where players can score by either placing new plants or by providing irrigation services to them.

Artwork and graphic design are unfortunately terrible (simultaneously garish and muted) and many supporting mechanisms (temples, goods, palaces) do not feel cohesive, but as far as soulless point salads go this one is quite enjoyable. The rondel gives some options for indirect interaction and there's a bit of collusion in the irrigation mechanism. I might have kept it if it were less ugly.

I really do not want to jinx the fine folk at Ystari, but seriously, can they do no wrong?  Caylus will always be my favorite of their titles (can we say fan girl?), but Amyitis is not far behind.  It is chock full of agonizing decisions and tactical distractions (my downfall in these games as I can not resist making impulsive decisions that veer me away from my intended path to victory).  While the game does not have any one mechanism that feels particularly innovative, it also does not feel (to me) like a mere combination of games I already have.  Each turn you can move a caravan marker in order to make purchases (or sell goods in one city), you can take cards (which give you one of four possible actions), or you can pass.  Sounds simple enough, yet the timing of these choices has a ripple effect that can win or lose you the game.

Initial Impression : I really like this game.  There are so many avenues to explore which I like in a game.  My wife won our first game (grrr).  I lead most of the game but she got the top banker and the top level Caravaner which made her options wide open (that won't happen again).  This gave her a path for many tile grabs.  The look ahead is short but can change often so you must keep a steady balance of VP coming in. Take the big VP payouts when you can.  

We never did feel like we were building a garden in the desert or traveling city to city picking up goods.  The theme is not very strong with this one.  I kind of felt like a city manager actually.  A bit like work and missing that special touch of fun.  Still, I enjoy it because it has that short turn to turn planning and mild randomness I like in games.  Luckily the graphics set it apart from other economic Euros.  I will keep this around as our dryish, thinky Euro.

Thoughts (2p) : This game is confrontational.  You must study your opponent and make moves to worsen their situation. 

update : This is the most confrontational game we own.  Never before have I wanted to flip the table after a game my wife and I played.  Agh.  Obviously I am not very good at it.  I will win...

This game was fine, it just ultimately got pushed out of the time/space slot by other more compelling games to me.  I think it's something I'd play again, but it's not like I'm going to a con and looking for players or anything.  

There's so many games from the last 10 years that are this way.  They are fine, but they really don't have much of a soul.  Games need soul to connect with you, whether that's through theme, or interesting mechanics I think is up to the individual.  I'm looking for soul.

This is a complicated game to learn on the first sit down.  Much like Cuba or Puerto Rico you just have to run though a game once before you get a good feel for it.

RATING: 6.7
[gameid=29934] is a strange beast because we have enjoyed the 3 games we have played, yet we have never felt compelled to go back. It has more often been a case of it being the last option...

The game centres around creating the gardens of Babylon and has a number of subsystems incorporated into it. One is travelling round Mesopotamia gathering flowers for the gardens, investing in palace building or banking or improving transportation.

Resources are required to that end and these are gathered in the fields. Priest and temples can provide benefits in terms of points or access to resources/ camels.

Each round begins with players acquiring cards in the form of priests, merchants, farmers or engineers. These cards are used to work the different aspects of the game. A worker gives you the option of working a farm and gaining a resource. This resource is dependant upon the order of the farms being created and therefore it is often a game of hide and seek, obscuring your intentions before placing in order to get the one you want.

The gardens require water, provided by the engineers. Once water has been supplied the garden can be cultivated and the tile taken. This requires the appropriate level of knowledge for the level of the garden.

There are many different aspects of the game and there can be a great deal of screwage. The main point of contention seems to be getting the highest level of transportation. A use of one camel allows you to move one field on the map. Improving your level of transportation gives you an increase in the number of fields a single camel may move. You can expend more camels to move further, but doing so sets you back nonetehless.

In our games we only realised this in the last game, thereby giving an unfair advantage to one player, yet, our discovery did not want us to go back and play it again.

The mechanics work. The game works. It is just not all that fun.

A resource-management, timing and efficiency game, and an extremely tactical one at that: While players do need to have a strategy, actions often are simply taking advangage of opportunities that happen to be available. Player intereaction is there but light, but you do need to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and planning. This is a bit of a Frankenstein in terms of fused mechanics, but the result works pretty well and, in fact, Amyitis has a pretty unique overall feel. While the game is interesting and I like a lot of what's happening here, I also think the game has balance issues. The money/banker track, especially, is overpowered, and the player who has gotten the level three (two talents/two points income) banker card has won every game I've played - easily. And this is my biggest pet peeve with Amyitis ... the fact that players get shut out on the various "tracks." In most games, when you upgrade an ability (from, say, the level 1 banker card to the level 2 card), the lower level card is returned so that other players can at least keep close (this is true of upgraded genes in Primoridal Soup, the fireplaces/cooking hearths in Agricola, etc.). Not here. In Amyitis, in a three-player game, one player (usually the one going third) will be completely shut out on the money track and doomed to receive zero income the entire game. Similarly, players will be shut out on the caravan and prestige building tracks as well. Makes no sense and, at least in the case of the money track, is a real game-breaker. Sadly, these flaws really hinder what would have been yet another strong offering from Ystari. I suppose this could be fixed with a house rule of simply having players turn in the lower level card (i.e. make it available to other players) when they upgrade. It's not what the designer intended, though, and the "fix" might also cause balance issues ...

Rating after a partial 2P game.  Rating might end up 8+, could end up 6.  

Upon first glance, this game really works in that Ystari school--simple yet deep choices are myriad (see Yspahan and Mykerinos), interaction is toned low, but is definitely there, and the game rewards forward thinking (and, conversely, is a bit harsh on first time players and careless thinkers).  

Seems to be a Euro that I am going to enjoy, and that won't wear out it's welcome with a wonky (yet historical) theme.

(1 play) Pretty good game. There's some concern about the cards being imbalanced -- it does seem like the farmers almost universally went first every time. Might go up if subsequent plays suggest this is not a problem, but it does introduce a bit of luck with turn order and so on. Some related concerns about getting banker upgrades; so far (including games I didn't play) the game hasn't been won by the player who didn't get one. Maybe there are strategies to alleviate that. We'll see.

The first time played, we forgot to flip the cards after planting--oddly, I think I enjoyed that game the most; the game took longer and there was a lot of competition for the gardner cards.  Or perhaps it isn't so odd--the next three games have seemed to end too quickly.

The rules could (and should) have been presented far more clearly.  For example, the term "craft card" is used four times on the first page, but not defined until page four--where one can infer the meaning from a picture in the side bar!  [Not to mention some (perhaps translation related) oddities such as Priests being classified as craftsmen, while Gardners are court cards???] To be fair, the rules author did try: pages two and three show all the game components, it's just that the accompanying textual descriptions were lacking.  E.g., 

"Recruitment: during the game, players will recruit characters to assist them.  They spend talents to hire peasants (L) who harvest the fields, priests (M) who pray in the temples, engineers (N) who irrigate the gardens, and merchants (O) who supply camels." 

would have been far more effective had it been phrased

"Craftsmen: during the game, players will recruit craftsmen to assist them.  Players spend talents to hire peasants (L) who harvest the fields, priests (M) who pray in the temples, engineers (N) who irrigate the gardens, and merchants (O) who supply camels.

Nine years after it was published, I managed to get this to the table. This Ystari game never made it to the table mainly due to the lackluster theme and the mechanics. I certainly regretted not bringing the game out to the table much earlier not because the game was good, but because the game has aged. It would have been much better received 5 or 8 years ago when some of the mechanics felt fresh. To be fair, Ystari had a stellar reputation after the publication of Yspahan, but sort of went on a downward spiral with the publication of little-mentioned Assyria and Amyitis. So, the game itself is a mish-mash of different scoring opportunities, not unlike Yspahan. Gamers and score by building canals and gardens or via special scoring cards. I generally enjoy games where folks get to specialize in scoring or least have one or two central areas of focus. However, after having played numerous Feld or Feld-inspired point salad games, Amyitis felt a bit stale. The theme is really thin and each phase felt humdrum. The mechanism not really mesh well and some features felt a bit more overpowered at first glance. I likely would have felt more inspired playing Amyitis when it first published. As it is, I can only rate it a mediocre game in 2016. There are a few interesting mechanism I must point out. First, I really enjoy the passing feature as a source of income. If you pass early, then you can collect additional coins each round. The second mechanism revolves around craft selection. Characters are split into several groups and selection becomes increasingly more expensive with each purchase within a single group. That's another neat mechanic which feels a bit like In the Year of the Dragon.

The 2-player game is very good too (and very tense). There are multiple strategies. I like the level of interaction: you have to watch the other players very closely

A lot of different strategies and a lot of things to check and analyse. Can be confusing sometimes. It's also hard to keep the same strategy game after games, you always have to adapt to the board.

Solid gameplay, plenty of different ways to score, and a good dose of screwage trying to beat other players to scoring opportunities.  Even with all that, the game seemed a little flat to me.  I'll have to give it another chance to see if my opinion changes.

interesting old school euro game

[+] very tight resource management, all the actions are interesting (even passing early), various viable strategies and clever tactical moves as well, well balanced, good rythm, works well with 2p or more
[-] theme, art & components on the low side (a bit outdated maybe)

play on BGA

For some reason, every time I tried to read the rulebook on this one, I just couldn't grok the gameplay. Craft cards, Court cards, two boards, it just wasn't making sense.

So I finally set it up and ran through a couple of turns on my own, and it turns out it's incredibly simple. You hire guys to give you resources, area control in temples, or access to tiles in the main garden. Or you move the camel caravan and acquire new upgrades for income, points, or tiles in the garden.

Fun game, lots to think about. Resources are taken in a set order, and different resources purchase different things in the caravan, so there are delicate timing issues (In three turns the caravan will likely move 4 spots away, and that spot takes a salt to purchase, but I can't get salt right now, so I'll take the dates now in order to set myself up to get the salt next turn...)

There's one card in the game that gives you points every turn you own it, and my wife Deb got it, and won the game by 11 points. It's an extremely powerful card, I won't say overpowered, but you really have to fight to pull off a win once someone has that card.

Muchas vías de obtención de puntos de victoria, con unas mecánicas más que interesantes. En las primeras rondas de la primera partida, puedes estar un poco desorientado, pero luego se le coge el truco se trata de un juego muy bueno.

Many ways to obtain VPs, wich very interesting mechanics. You may be a little bit disoriented at the beginning. However, it is a very good game once you get it.

My first play with 4 was not a good experience, but since then I've played a couple times with 3 and found the game considerably more enjoyable, although I wouldn't go so far as to call it a game I'm enthusiastic about. I like some of the mechanisms, and I find the whole an overall interesting experience. The random distribution of the craft cards that come up can be annoying.

UPDATE: After a handful of plays I can say I'm done with this one. Like other Ystari games, it feels overwrought and lacking tension.

For now I see amyitis as a nice game, nice mechanics. Why only a 7? The game lacks ingenouity, it is playable, refreshing, but if you just started your collection, try other workerplacements. Maybe in a sale it's a top purchase. Amyitis is mostly for exeprencied gamers, families will see it, smile and most likely play another game.

This is a resource management game with a Babylonian gardens theme.  Having played one five-player game, I get the sense that this game, like Stephenson's Rocket, offers a lot of options to a player and it's a player's strategy that defines what scoring options will be the focus.

Purchased Essen 2007.
A good game with plenty going on, several different ways of scoring points and a choice of development opportunities. Many interactive considerations: you need to watch what resources others are collecting, which gardens they are irrigating, how far they can move the caravan, which temples can be used to best effect and so on. A minor niggle is that it feels like you can't plan too far ahead because of the limit on how many resources can be retained between rounds.

After my first play one of the other gamers described this as "more tactical than strategic".  He didn't have the camels but he still won quite soundly.  I did feel that I was largely reacting more to the current game situation more than planning long term.  I would like to play it again to re-rate it.  I like the fact that it plays in around 90 minutes or so.  There are some things that happen early in the game that have a huge impact on how the game will be played out.

The designer has posted that this game needs to be played several times to really see it shine. I think I've seen all that is there after a play, but I'm hoping to be surprised. In any case, I intend to give it a few more plays, at least, as I quite enjoy what is there.

2nd play tonight. Banker wins again. Donnnnie put up a score that rounded the final bend of the board with a heavy irrigation strategy.

3rd play: Game now seems more meh. I don't see anything new coming, and the analysis isn't particularly exciting.

One of the last few titles from Essen 2007 that I finally got a chance to try.  Wasn't expecting much due to the numerous lukewarm reviews I've read since then.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly deep and strategic gameplay here.  Each round the players take turns to either hire a craftsman or to move the caravan, passing allows one to collect gold as long as the others continue to perform an action.  I like the dynamic of whether to go after what you want immediately or to wait out your opponents in the hopes of putting yourself in a more advantageous situation.  However, sometimes that delay may mean a missed opportunity when the caravan moves beyond the city you desire or another person claims the action you need.  I agree that the game can potentially bog down if the distribution of the craftsman is consistently lobsided, especially with the absence of merchants or farmers.  Fortunately, this did not happen in our session, so we moved at a fairly brisk pace without too much downtime.  House rules may be necessary to guarantee the availability of all the jobs every round.

I did not find Amyitis too reptitive and for me there is always a tough decision to make.  I definitely prefer this over the tired mechanics of Cuba and Hamburgum, which seem to garner more positive buzz.  Oh well, I guess I just dare to be different!

This is a cleverly counterweighted game, providing players plenty of choices to vie for prestige.  One four-player game may end with a winning score over 100, and another with a winning score under 50, which illustrates how dynamic this game can be.  Plus, you get a little "Rochester" card drafting, which is generally a good thing.

After 2+ Plays: This has beat out Caylus: Magna Carta as my least favorite of Ystari's games.  While CMC had nothing particularly wrong with it (it was merely a pale imitation), I have several specific complaints about this one.  

First, I really don't like how the Caravan board puts you completely at the mercy of the player on your right.  This is compounded by the second problem: the bank/caravaneer cards are too powerful.  They seemed obviously important to me after learning the rules, so my strategy in my first game was to get one of each as soon as possible.  However, that was also the thinking of the player to my right.  He managed to grab one first, and so of course, because of how the caravan track works, I was denied them for most of the game, as he almost always got them before I did.  In my third game, I managed to upgrade my bank each of the first three turns, and I ran away with the game.  Again, my ability to do this had more to do with caravan placement, and less with any ability on my part.  

Lastly, I think the irrigation option is woefully underpowered.  This is unfortunate, because it could have addressed some of the balance issues I have with the upgrades.  The problem is that two VP's isn't enough to compensate for opening up scoring opportunities for other players.  The VP's that you gain when the garden is planted seems designed to compensate for this, but it just doesn't work.  In all three of my games, very rarely has anyone gained more than a few of these points, and then usually only when they planted the garden themselves.  The reason for this is that when two or more players tie, none get the points.  It is all too easy to create ties, and so a player investing heavily in irrigation will often not reap the benefits of their actions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A two player game was alright. It looks very promising, but is probably best with more players.

After playing again with more players the reactions were mixed. The game is considerably lighter than Caylus and it has less depth. It still pretty though and there's a lot of interesting decisions. There's a few balance issues with the Level 3 Banker it seems, but I'll want to play again to be sure.

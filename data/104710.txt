I've had mixed feelings about this game. I've loved it in a few plays, and hated it in others. It is dependent on the gaming group, and not taking it too seriously. The bad plays have revolved around players trying to plan the perfect move for a turn, and consequently dragging the game out.

A bit of whacky fun that suffers from really being only 4 players. A lot of the game seems to be coming up with ways to take advantage of vague rules and abilities in your favour. It's a bit of fun if you're in the mood for a silly battle game.

The granddaddy to Magic the gathering. This is a board game about wizards fighting other wizards and either trying to be the last one standing or the richest by stealing two other chests from other wizards. Killing all the other wizards is more fun. The game is a combination of spell casting and base defense. Good old fashioned fun. I have painted many of the miniatures and like to play this game but it is a medium light game that can become stale if played too much. I think it makes a good pre or post medium to heavy game.

[2-5] 2p House Rule: you must have at least one of the opponents treasures in your home base before you can kill him off - if any spell inflicts enough damage to kill him before you have dropped one treasure in your home base, he dies, drops everything, and then resurrects in the same square with one life point. The game continues as normal. 

We use Deadly Treasures, Uncluttered Minds, and mix every spell school in.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I thought that this game really suffered its age. The idea of wizards fighting is neat, but very common right now and at this point there're games that do what this game did way better. The game didn't hooked me at all. The component were decent, but the game-play was simply boring.

I always saw friends of mine playing this game and having a lot of fun, but never played, than finally I played the game and had a lot of fun. The game mechanics are simple and the card effects are funny and cool. The game is very beautiful. There are some issues for me with some opportunities that sometimes harms the players who are loosing in order to give you a boost because of the situation and some other issues, but overall it is a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
We found this to be a not-much-fun reimplementation of a classic: the race element just doesn't let all the magical possibilities come out.  The highish rating is for a variant we hit on, in which two teams of two mages take each other on in a deathmatch.  *Much* more fun.

RATING: 4
Short and random with little feeling of control.

RATING: 6.5
The simplest way to create a kill-n-steal game is to slap on a fantasy theme where everything goes.

The game is fast, furious and fun for the right type of gamers. Nothing too serious and wizard will shine for you.

Did not like the fine type-size. The initial game where cards need to be properly read is a slight step back.

Overall, it's the simplest killing game done in half hour even for 4 players. A filler game.

FUN!!!

A bunch of wizards running around slinging spells at each other trying to steal stuff. How could that be fun?? There are so many 'Take That' games available and pretty much to the last one they are not the greatest games on the shelf. Wiz War however is a blast. It plays quickly and offers players seemingly limitless opportunities to harm your opponents. But for every means of dealing out damage there are just as many ways to foil your opponents plans. This to me is the heart of the game and what sets it apart from most other games of this sort. Not only are there tons of cards that let you do quite a few neat things but the number of combinations you can make with those cards is limitless. Lots of intelligent ways to mix up the cards to do interesting and downright dastardly stuff to your opponents or get out of their attempts to do the same to you. But the great thing the game allows you to do is create a narrative. There will be endless stories that you will tell your friends that weren't at the table. Don't get me wrong, I like a good cube pusher, but there is no way I'm going to call a friend over to the table to recount a series of elegant moves in one of those games! In Wiz-War however this happens just about every game. Hilarious fun.

The ideas here seemed neat and the components were nice. But my one play just seemed overly-fast, quite luck heavy, and almost like it played itself. I might give it another shake sometime out of curiosity, but it's pretty whatever to me.

A game that does everything that it wants to.  It creates powerful spells that combo with each other in mysterious and crazy/random ways.  Huge combinations of play, especially with expansions.

RATING: 9
The only reason it's not a 10 is because there has to be room for improvement with the (inevitable) expansions. Seriously fun game, as serious as fun allows. I've been a big fan of this game for decades, even wrote a few cards that made it into expansions, and will never, ever turn down a game. Love the new card art and you can tell a lot of love went into this edition.

Отличная тактическая стратегия про бои колдунов в лабиринте. Применяются предметы, заклинания, колдуны превращаются в существа. Игра - рандомная, но в меру. Веселая и масштабируемая - на 2-4 человека.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable wizards duel. It's very random, but I think that adds to it's particular charm. It exists in a weird place; not quite complicated enough to be a super deep game, but too complicated to really enjoy with newer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A classic old school game gets a facelift. The new components are great and the artwork is nice. The game is chaotic, random and fun. Its like playing Magic but with a board and miniatures. Usually takes about 30 minutes but the cards are text heavy so initial plays will take longer. The base rules are very easy to teach but there are so many cards that break them and some card effects are a bit ambiguous. In the manual there are many optional rules that you can use to change the rules to your liking. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast and fun. Lot of randomness and chaos-- but that's what the game is designed to be. As long as it's played quickly, I think this has the potential to be entertaining for lots of plays, exploring the variety of the spell cards.

Very fun 4 player strategy game where you try to eliminate the other players. It isn't too sophisticated to learn, plays well, and isn't extremely time consuming.

RATING: 8.5
What a good time I have had with this game. The biggest thing with this game I feel, is accepting that the winner is going to be just shy of randomly defined. There are a lot of games like that, which I own, and hate for it, but here it works because the theme is just so much fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Oh man, this is a blast. You really will feel like a wizard in a labyrinth pulling crazy and desperate tricks. This game consistently produces amazing and surprising moments and rapid changes of fortune due to clever plays (and luck, too, of course). Tons of flavor in the different schools of magic. 

Lends itself to house rules and variants. Best at max player count, but I also enjoy 2 player with two wizards each, with separate schools of magic for each player and a shared common spell book (usually the Mythology school from Bestial Forces). 

I love the card art! Comes with a ton of great components and the expansions just add even more fun. 

This is a 10 for the variety of spells and effects and the entertainment factor. So much fun with the right players.

Played this at a convention when asked.  I had read about the game in the past, and thought it might be fun for a twirl.  Guess not, at least for my tastes.  Don't mind take-that, don't mind random, don't mind short, etc.  I often like that stuff, it just didn't come together for me here.  Made me want to play Drakon.

3/20/16: A tactical skirmish.  This is one of the games where you're there to enjoy the ride, it's not about winning.

It's amusing, something I would consider a filler or a light game.  What makes it fun is the effects and countereffects, the interacting spells.  This game reminds me of cosmic encounter.  What makes it not so enjoyable for me is that it is extremely tactical and luck driven.  It's something that I'll play occasionally, but I won't be the one pushing to get it to the table.

Best with 4, okay with 3.

Dungeon Twister killer. I wished for some more control over what and how many cards come in my hand. Other than that, a simple, colourful, with many spells to choose from and explore their combo uses. Feels like a less abstract dungeon twister, wished for a longer playtime.

RATING: 7
Richard Garfield took much from Wiz-War to design Magic and created a great game, but sadly lost the great spatial element. Eight edition Wiz-War reincarnates again a great game from the eighties, and restores that spatial element in the mage dueling.

Wiz-War is fast, furious and funny. Hilarious situations happen very often, and it's almost as funny watching plans fail as seeing them accomplish.

The only aspect I don't like too much is player elimination, but the game is so short it often doesn't matter much.

Eager to play it again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wiz-war is far from the perfect game; however, it is a perfect game for my family.  It plays fast, has simple rules, a great theme, and is enjoyed by all.

We prefer to play with more of the variant rules included in the rulebook for a more classic feel, but do include some of the newer rules.

I believe custom spellbooks is a must.  While there is a definite appeal to the use of a single giant spellbook, I believe that certain schools of magic were built with the premise that cards from that school would be drawn pretty regularly at a higher frequency than if a giant spellbook was used.

To my family and me, this game is a blast and the best way to experience magical combat with some capture the flag mixed in.  Games play fast with little downtime.

I have to give the game at least an 8 because of the sheer fact that my wife is willing to play and she usually abhors these types of games (cards with text, lots of little components, miniatures).

I love that there is a lot of variant rules that make customizing the game to better fit out family's tastes possible.

Played 2 games of this, 4 player, back to back. First game was a complete disaster. We used the "recommended" spell decks. Game was a complete snoozefest. Not many attacks. Just treasure stealin' and counter spells. 2nd game went much better. I used the other 4 spell decks for that game. We had 1 player get the "Big Man" form card twice, keeping it active for a total of 11 rounds. They were able to pull off the win. Attacks were much more formidable in this game. Red was down to 2 life at one point. Blue (who won), had to go through the 4 Booby Trap tiles to get his 2nd treasure back to base for the win. First tile damaged him for 4 damage, putting him at 2 life. Another wizard cast Fireball at him, but he countered it and won on his next turn (only by playing a big movement boost). So, it's ok. Very random, very chaotic. I do tend to enjoy more strategic style of games. This is going on the trade pile.

RATING: 7
Definitely a beer-and-pretzels game, but strategy is certainly there.  Every turn players have to make a number of choices, all with their pros and cons, so this isn't totally mindless and honestly has a fair bit of strategy mixed in with a large amount of luck of the draw.  Player politics runs high in this classic.  Components are fantastic.

EDIT: I wrote the above in such a weird way, May 2012 huh... well anyway I have no idea what I was thinking so I'm bumpin' her down a point, good game but high set-up time and isn't strategic OR /that/ accessible

Interesting game, but it needs conflict between the players to be great, if there is not, it kinda lacks something.

Good theme while being weighted toward functionality.  Acceptable amount of chaos.  Won my first and only game because I was the one guy who didn't jump on the other player.  

Thinking about it though, I could see future play wearing it thin rather quickly.  Not a bad game or even badly done.  Stripped down for functionality which I think cuts down the replay-ability and my desire to want to play it.

*Another play, reassessing my thoughts on the strip down toward functionality as a bad thing.  I think it actually makes for a great game, getting the complex rules out of the way of the fun, but I still think the game itself is still very vulnerable to over-play.  Player interaction with just the right amount of theme and depth are what make this game an '8' rather than a '5' or '6'.

RATING: 8
9 plays.

If one player is not in a position (or so it seems) to interact with another, then that player can take their turn while the other player is still taking theirs.  However, there are some cards like "SWAP!" which renders this untrue, so maybe ask if it's OK first.  (But that problem never came up.)  Speeds up gameplay.

Seems to work better with 4 players than with 3.

3-player game: first wizard was killed, and victory occurred in the same turn, so no one had to sit out.  4-player games: in the three 4-player games, no one has died and everyone has won by stealing two treasures.  (OK, this is no longer true, as we've definitely had a few wizards die.  Still, violence isn't the answer people!)

It seems uncommon for people to get stuck in place due to getting walled in on either side, which was a problem with the old version.  Such a problem, really turned me off the older game.

Really enjoying this - the games are all reasonably close and end quickly once one player dies.

RULES CLARIFICATIONS/HOUSE RULES:
Wall of Earth can reflect Lightning Bolt.
Mental Force can only push in one direction.

Vicces, eléggé pörgős, mágus csatározás egy fantázia labirintusban, mindez kártyák segítségével. A saját körödben három fázist kell végrehajtanod, az első (folyamatban levő varázslataid fenntartása, kábultságból feleszmélés) és a harmadik (kártya opcionális eldobása és új(ak) felhúzása) nagyon egyszerű, a másodikban van a tényleges akciózás: mozgás és varázslás(ok) kombinált használata. Négyen játszottuk, azt vettük észre, hogy amint valaki megszerez egy kincset, akkor már jobban kell rá figyelni, mert ha nem tesszük, akkor egyszercsak besunnyog a másodikkal és nyer. :-)

Egyelőre csak az ajánlott, kezdő négy paklival játszottuk, két játék után már egész jól megértettük a kártyákat, és mindenki képben volt. Alig várom a következő játékokat, meg a kiegészítőkre is nagyon kíváncsi vagyok.

Szórakoztató játék, ajánlott a kipróbálása mindenkinek.

Chaos rules whenever Wiz-War is being played: not only is it one of the most fun, unpredictable and interactive games I’ve ever played but it also excels at giving players countless chances of thwarting their opponents by casting nasty spells on them, which means lots of laughs, jokes and memorable happenings.

No carefully planned strategy survives the first round. [i](June 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - If there’s a game that deserves a 10 in my book that’s Wiz War: it’s the champagne game par excellence, the game that rewards taking risks and aiming at dangerous but wicked plays, the game where every card played comes with a nasty «take that!» grin and a malicious look.

There are so many things that make Wiz-War the perfect game: this is why after further dabbling with it (and shattering the dreams and hopes of my opponents en passant) it’s about time I raise my rating from 9 to 10 in July 2016.

RATING: 9
Sweet delicious WiZ-War.  This game rocks.  You're flinging spells, figuring out combos, running for your life and laughing your ass off.  If you hate direct confrontation in your games then this is a game you should stay FAR away from.  Also, if you're a rules lawyer who needs to bitch about each card and they way they're written...go away.  This is meant to be a big dumb wizard fight.  Think Vincent Price's "The Raven" or Disney's "Sword in the Stone"...both of those have epic wizard duels and that is what this game captures.  Powerful, cantankerous wizards trying to outsmart and kill one another.

A fun brawl fest.  Lots of "take that"!  Once you get the rules down, it plays pretty fast.  Unfortunately, there's still a bit of vague rules (e.g. Mist Body - Can you be hurt by anything?  What about fire?  What about Magical damage?)

Easily the best game for generating memorable moments. Flinging spells and messing with others has never been so fun and the outcomes are just as unpredictable. Quick to play, well-defined ruleset, modular, highly replayable. Ameritrash at it's finest!

Don't take a game of Wiz-War too seriously. Over beer and pretzels, this one can be a blast. I've even had a good time playing with only 2 players. It's basically a game of Team Fortress (capture the flag) when all the players are superheroes. The spells all feel overpowered, which make playing this a hoot: turn into a werewolf, eat your way through a stone wall, shoot a fireball that can turn 90 degrees etc.

Wiz-War is hilarious. Downsides are player-elimination and randomness.
The dominant strategy seems to be racing for treasures, which is rather boring sadly. So the game is really funny, if Wizards pile on each other and throw spells around, but the "win-by-treasure" is soooooo bad.

After first game, 2er: This is a great deal of fun, with the caveat that you need to have the right attitude.  The spells give you a lot of options, but the random draw can leave you with a pile of nothing, or exactly what you need, or something in between.  I really enjoyed my first play, and look forward to more, but I will be trying not to play "competitively" - that is, I will focus on the experience rather than the result.  

The game is very tactical, with some strategic control in what cards you save for later, and which ones you dump to be able to draw new ones.  But overall, it feels like you ride the wave of what you draw and hope really hard.  Still, lots of fun, and plays quickly.  A good addition to the collection, and one I expect will get regular play.

I love this game! It's funny, it's vindictive, and it's hugely enjoyable. Thank you, FFG, for finally reprinting it! The only thing that kept the original from being a [10] was the crappy quality of the bits: cheap B/W cardstock boards and cards (not even vinyl-coated!) and fairly plain counters (cute cartoony artwork though). The new version doesn't quite make it to a [10] either, because I think the cards are a bit too busy; FFG have tried to account for any potential rules-lawyery, but that's just meant they've had to fill the cards with tiny text; simpler spells and a more comnprehensive FAQ would have been fine. I'd been waiting for the reprint since Chessex  began advertising it in "Fall 2000". This now needs the inevitable expansion(s) to let another couple of players join in, and to add more spells (especially summoning monsters) back into the glorious, chaotic mess that is Wiz-War!

RATING: N/A
Quoted from forums:

"One piece of advice though, the game plays much better using several of the optional rules in the back from earlier editions of Wiz-War (you should also use the old-school tile sides). We use Deadly Treasures, Uncluttered Minds, and mix every spell school in.

Also, we took some advice found here on the forums that suggested removing most of the boring counterspells - this is a great suggestion that vastly improves the experience. You get more deadly combat, wizards actually die, and the game doesn't devolve into a foot race to the opponents treasure (although that is still there in smaller doses). I wouldn't rate this game quite as high without these changes"

If you combine all the cards together into 1 big deck, then this is my suggestion of what to take out and what to leave in:

Take Out:
Anti-Anti - with fewer counterspells you don't need a counter-counterspell
Dispel X 3 - that still leaves 2 Dispels in the deck - lets let some of the obstacles actually be obstacles for a few rounds
Wall of Earth X 3 - just a fancy sounding counterspell
Shield X 3 - huge damage reduction - boring
Full Shield X 3 - standard counterspell
Negate Neutral X 4 - why stop fun neutral cards from happening?
Featherweight X 2 - not only counters but moves someone back out of combat range as well, further from the action
Teleport - teleporting 4 squares in a game where you are trying to limit movement is ENORMOUS. This card would already be overpowered even if it wasn't also able to be played as a LOS counterspell. 
Invisible - 75% chance to evade any attack for possibly a lot of rounds
Bloodshard - reduces damage by 1 each time - boring
Lifestone - gain 1 point of health every round - makes the game longer

Here is what that leaves you in terms of counterspells and damage reduction:

Keep In:
Mist Body X 2 - cannot be attacked while in mist form but allows you to get through locked doors even while carrying treasure
Gnome Form - 50% chance to evade attacks, but movement drops to 2 and you get to use the cool gnome mini
Golem Form - 2 point damage reduction, base move drops to 2, but you can pick up a treasure and keep going, also the cool Golem mini
Share Life - it heals one person, but sucks life out of the other, so no net gain of health to the game
Homonculus - yes it absorbs some damage, but its a little man following you around jumping into harms way - very cute
Dispel X 2 - just so there is hope you can get that annoying curse off of you at some point
Absorb Spell - its a counter, but then you get the spell card, so you will be able to cast it yourself later
Null Powder - its a counter but also can be used to remove curses or creations, etc.
Flood - cool effect and only counters fire
Wall of Fire - cool effect and only counters water
Pain Link X 2 - whatever damage you take, they take too - my favorite card!
Backlash - a counter that also damages the original caster

So I made some changes. Here is what I did to improve gameplay.

1. (Deadly Treasures option) I rein-stated the Deadly Treasure rule as it makes people occasionally stop going for the win and go after one of their own treasures to prevent themselves from being killed.

2. (Giant Book of Spells option) I gave up the silly "mix this small deck plus that small deck plus this deck of cantrips" or whatever and just threw all the cards together in one big deck. There is no reason in the world not to do this.

3. I gathered up all the counterspells and healing things and removed them from the deck. The reason is - there are like 30+ counterspells/healing cards of different kinds. When I played my 2nd game I did all the clever things I could think of to blow away the opposition, but literally 7 out of 8 offensive spells I cast were countered in some form or fashion. One of the counterspells actually teleported the person I was attacking through a stone wall and gave him an easy win. This was not only frustrating but ridiculous.

The next time I played - with the new, let's call it BRUTAL Deck, we actually had spells hitting people and people taking damage and there was much carnage and mayhem and a wizard died and all was right with the world. Nothing is more frustrating to me than playing against decks filled with counterspells. It takes ALL the fun out of the game. Leave in 1 or 2 of your favorites maybe, but not dozens. Also the healing ... what is the point in a 30 minute beer and pretzels style game - just extends the game length and prevents fun wizard murdering.

4. (Permanent Creations option) Having creations be temporary until you decide to dispel them makes it easier for people to run around and get through obstacles (race game). There are plenty of cards that dissolve walls and so forth so that you don't need this ability. If you place a rose bush or stone block or whatever behind you, then someone creates a wall in front of you, you are going to have to actually fish for a dispell card or a destroy wall card or actually use the crack/damage mechanic to break out. The point is, that there will be many times when someone gets stuck or slowed down or hurt or stunned playing this way, which is a good thing. The second point about this is that these cards shouldn't take up a spot in your hand, giving you less cards to do cool things with (Uncluttered Minds option).

5. Play with the Old Boards - side B. They are more winding and slow down the race aspect of the game. Also - do NOT use the ability from the new boards - side A, that says that YOU CAN go through the doors in your home board while other players can't. It should be set so that ALL DOORS are equally hard to get through. Once again, this slows the race aspect of the game down and makes people have to be more clever to get to the victory conditions

If I could design one game, this would be it. The theme alone is superb, but the game is just FUN. For me, it is a filler much in the same mold as Cosmic Encounter. There is chaos, but you can manage your hand for that killing combo. Hilarious situations are likely to happen all the time, and I have as much fun winning as running for my life. Kudos to FFG for their great job with the reprint.

No my kind of game.  Tried it because I liked the premise.  Most of the time is spent reading the card powers.  Then, it's just a matter of playing as many of your cards as you can (occasionally but rarely holding on to a card for strategic reasons).  Decisions are trivial and formed with very little knowledge since other players' cards have the biggest effect in the game.  Random play time.  Player elimination.  Chaotic.
The only fun was getting into the theme.  But even that got old quickly.

Wizards run around a labyrinth, stealing each others' treasures and beating each other up through a bunch of take-that style card play.  The first Wizard to score two points wins (you score a point for killing a wizard, or for returning a treasure to your home base).  You can also win by being the last wizard standing!

The game is kinda sorta fun since there's a wide variety of wizardy antics, like making flaming walls, throwing fireballs around, casting lightning bolts, etc.  However, in the end, this just isn't my style of game, but people that like thematic take-that style games will probably have a better time with this one.

A light-weight creative battle game.  This game excels with 3-4 players, it plays quick (40 minutes), and is just easy fun.  The superb moments come in from creating slick combos or pulling out a dirty trick to foil your opponents plans.

Throw a bunch of nerds into a basement, and tell them to slap each other around while stealing boxes of goodies, and you essentially have Wiz-War.  The game is super customizable, with destructive environments, spells that rotate the boards (effectively changing the layout), etc., etc., etc!  Choosing from the various schools of magic to create the players' "spellbook" easily changes up the feel of the game.  Want a more battle-intensive game?  Add Elemental and Alchemy into the deck!  Want to play with a bit more strategy, while manipulating the labyrinth's layout?  Try Conjuration and Transformation!  Don't have any good spells at your disposal?  Run your wizzened old self up to your opponent and slap them across the face!  YEAH!  Good times!

My criterion for ranking games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Every game plays out so differently. Depending on what type of spells each wizards has and what strategy each one tries the game gives a different story each game. Plus the spells themselves are so flavorful and fun. 

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  Using your spells and deciding to run or fight are the decisions you make from beginning to end and the decisions are so much fun and affect how the game plays out.

3) Player interaction:  Combat, turning each other into stone, etc. This game has a TON of interaction.

4) Components/artwork:  Fantastic miniatures and the artwork is nice.

5) Game length/complexity:   ok length of the game. Often the game will take a bit too long, but overall goes just the right amount of time. The complexity is not too much that it is too hard to teach, but the geek factor is high on it so that it's hard to get some people to play it. 


Bottom line: This is a super fun game with combat, wizards, awesome spells, fantasy theme, great miniatures, and a great experience for 2-4 players.

Houserules/variants are needed to make this game the awesome game that has survived decades.  I've changed the rules somewhat heavily, but don't fret - that does not make this a poor game! It should've been more clearly advertised as such, but Wiz War is a customizable game in a box, essentially. You can re-tune the game and turn it into the Wiz-War you want it to be. 

And a very fun customizable game it is! Buying a copy of Wiz War is like opening a lobby in a FPS game and choosing the rules. Double health? Grenade Launchers only? Capture the Flag, Teams, Deathmatch?

Customize the global deck, take out cards that kind of ruin the game (*cough*dispels*cough*). Heck, I've removed the transformations because they slow things down and make things a little less fun. 

You can play this however you want. Just break it down and put together a deck that you enjoy best. Think some abilities are too strong? Remove them. Think there are too many energy cards? Lose some. 

Think the energy system is a little wacky? Change the rules! That's what I did. 

This game is a box of fun, but it's VERY much a sandbox game. A very rare treat. You'll enjoy this game if you enjoy making houserules and variants. There's nothing sacred in Wiz-War - change things to your heart's content!

I love using [u]spells[/u]! It's like playing Dungeon Twister with MTG cards. Two player sessions are less random.
[i]Mixing all the cards together is a very good alternative to increase the tactical possibilities. A useful two player house rule is that you must have at least one of the opponents treasures in your home base before you can kill him off. The best 2 player variant seems to be with each player controlling 2 wizards with a hand of cards shared between the two wizards (alternate turns & setting the victory conditions to 3VP).[/i]

Brilliant mage dueling game that evokes a lot of laughter and shit talking, which is precisely what I want when blasting friends away with spells that take away half of their life total, or blocking their path when they've stolen my treasure with a well-timed stone block. Always play with classic rules, B-side boards and with one huge deck. First plays where with standard rules, A-side boards and FFG's idea of making a deck with two schools of magic and a cantrip, which was a horrible idea in hindsight.

I recommend this thread on BGG for making the game more intense:

I've wanted to play Wiz-War since I read about it in a copy of The Duellist some ten years ago (it was "soon to be reprinted" then as well).

I managed to find a copy of the seventh edition, and for all of it's randomness and silliness, the game was incredibly fun and highly thematic.

The most important change in this edition is the act of actually getting it back in print - it's far too important and hilarious a game to wallow outside of publication.

Wiz-War is not a game to take seriously. There's rarely much strategy far beyond the immediate turn, and it's entirely possible that the random elements conspire into turning out a sub-par game once in a while. Nevertheless, alongside Cosmic Encounter, it's easily one of my favourite games ever made.

For some reason I really like this one, even though it seems like the winner needs a significant dose of luck. I find it is one of those games where it is fun to see what you can pull off even if it may not help you win. For the most part I think FFG did an alright job on the reprint, but I haven't played the original. I kinda wish they wouldn't mess around with the rules when reprinting games, but on the other hand the rules changes made here seem pretty simple and reasonable.

Update: The fun seems to vary based on which card sets you are using. Some of the cards are not useful enough to justify the time taken to read their overly wordy text. I think I will try making my own mix of cards before I play this next time.

I really like so many things that this game does! However I just find its cartoony art style, humor, and exact execution off from what I wanted. I came into this wanting a Dungeon Command that would allow me to bust open walls or Frostgrave experience on game board. Because it wasn't what I wanted I let it go but it doesn't mean its not a great game. I just am on the hunt to find that perfect Wizard game.

Better than I remembered the original version to be. Once everyone gets a feel for the mechanics and familiar with the various parts and pieces each game becomes a brief, violent battle. 

As in the original game, treasures exist only as an excuse to go kill the other players. What's not to like about that?

RATING: 5
Great core mechanics but there is so much inconsistency in the language used in the rulebook that I find it more frustrating than fun to play. Feels like it is on the verge of being unplayable right out of the box. Another big minus for me is that the art design is just all over the place. FFG has never been my cup of tea for art design (kind of 90s Gamesworkshop pointy skulls and giant shoulderpads/boots meets DeviantArt-style manga-ish human figures). A huge disappointment given how hyped the game was and the seemingly large place it has in game history (having reportedly inspired MtG).

It takes good knowledge of the different schools to play a quick paced match. Presentation and mechanics are well designed. Although there could be confusion on card system that is being handled by the FAQ versions from FFG.

Wiz-War was a disappointment for me.  I was hoping that when I played it I would get a great feeling of a classic game that has been updated by FFG, similarly to Cosmic Encounter.  Sadly, I didn't feel it really turned out to be a great game.  I played three four player games.  It was interesting in that it reminded me of a four team capture the flag with the option of killing the opponents for points.  I think my biggest problem was that killing people just doesn't seem to be worth the effort to go for since there are so many hard counters.  While people are trying to kill opponents other people could simply grab a treasure and bring it back to their base.  Maybe this would be a better option in a two player game, or even a three player.  It has also been a long time since I've played a game with player elimination and I didn't like it.  Some games (ie Werewolf) are interesting to watch after you've been eliminated but I didn't get that feeling with this game.  At least games don't take terribly long if you do happen to get eliminated.  Overall, I think I prefer Tom Jolly's other dungeon game: Drakon.  I think I even prefer Cave Troll to this one.  Finally, I would also think Blood Bowl: Team Manager is a better AT game for 2 - 4 players and cheaper to boot!

The new chrome is a great change from the original game; however, the added headache of all the icons on the various cards is a detractor. I hate to say it, but I think I prefered the original.

RATING: 7
In general, I applaud the changes FFG has made -- while some of the charm has been lost, there's also less chaos and frustration that can result from card combinations taking players out of the game for extended periods of time, making their participation in the game irrelevant.  While these situations led to some hilarity, they weren't very fun if you were on the receiving side.  The variety of decks is good.  The game is ready-made for expansions, of course.  In my opinion, it desperately needs the ability to scale beyond 4 -- where's the first expansion?  Note that the classic rules are listed as "variants" in the back of the book, so you can effectively play by the old rules if you wish.

Don't own.

My gaming buddies love this. It didn't appeal to me but I admit it was better than I expected.

Attractive board, plays in an hour or less, simple goal (get 2 pts.), cards easily understood.  I enjoyed the unusual and unique card distribution--I played with four and we paired off with each pair choosing several decks.  Decks of a pair were mixed together and the pair draws only from their deck--Yet, they are opponents.  It is everyone for himself!

The winner was unexpected (and I was told that is not unusual)--but the loser wasn't--that was me. When someone heartlessly attacked me with a huge hit I went after them with vengeance and failed in every attack and each attack was turned back on me, and I died!  Ordinarily I'd back off & lick my wounds, but I was in a rush to meet some guests so I did my best to slaughter the other (even using rocks), but to no avail. 

Massive reading and luck of the draw do not endear this game to me.

Gyors szórakoztató varázslógyilkolászás. Nem szabad ennél többet képzelni bele, és akkor élvezni fogod. :)
Nagyon szép kivitelezés, gyönyörű kártyák, jó kombozós mechanizmus. Elsőre kicsit talán túl értékesnek éreztem a számozott kártyákat. Ezen felül azzal a problémával is küzd - több hasonló játékkal egyetemben - hogy könnyed szeretne lenne, de a tanulási folyamata aránylag nehéz. Eleinte rengeteget kell olvasgatni a kártyákat, amiken extrém sok a szöveg. így lelassul a játék és elveszik az eredeti értelme. Persze 3-4 játék után ez beáll, de addig szerintem igazán tudja azt nyújtani, amire ki lett találva.

You mitigate damage, manage some random elements, and strategize to win. Easy to play, yet the decisions can be tough.

Birthday gift to self in 2012.  Have only punched and bagged it. I sense that whilst I would like to play it, there are just so many other games I would like to play first. Hence, rated a harsh 6 (2/12/12). Well, opportunity arises to give it a play, and its a fun light game. Very chaotic back stabing with 4 (lite spite), and a definite 7 game (3/5/13).UPDATE: It really is not my type of game, with different spell cards and the dynamic of 4 people in a square maze waiting for someone to move, or two people picking on each other.  I can see why some people would like this, but I don't, so gone (Rating 5.628, Jan 17)

a very entertaining and quick game of minds and magic set in a sort of dangeon like stone maze where up to four wizards(5 with malefic curse expansion) battle each other in order to steal their treasures while keeping the one they own or old safe. the plot is just that a competition started and only the best can survive and be crowned as archmage. featuring decks full of different spells, the maze board that can be destroyed, rotated or modified by players and 2 expansions so far, shows how this game is vary and how many different situations may happen during each game that is usually different from the ones played before

RATING: 8.5
Love this game. Always wanted to try this one and with the reprint I can finally play.

This is such a fun game of wizards running around a maze filled dungeon and trying to steal the other players treasures and bring them back to their home base. Along the way all kinds of crazy things can happen, as the wizards battle it out, by casting spells at each other and the things in the dungeon maze. There's a ton of classes and spells, that each player can specialize in and cast.

This one is just a blast and provides lots of laughs and groans along the way. I can't recommend this one enough. It's a great gamers game and isn't to hard, so the game can be taught and learned by older children with a little time. Gamers will love this one.

Yes it can be random at times, but who cares. This is a hoopy game. I love how at the game end, you feel like you've just been through an epic tale and stories will be talked about forever. We still laugh at my friend who was guarding his treasure and then another player came into his treasure room, stole the treasure and the created a wall locking him in his own, now empty treasure vault. LMAO PRICELESS!!!

Magic the Gathering light but better as you have a board and miniatures which adds a physical dimension (position and movement) to the mystical forces being unleashed against opposing Wizards. Bash the Leader is mandatory and luck of the card draw is a fact of life - get on with it. There is a little amniguity in a couple of the card wordings/interactions but a little common sense (and the very good FAQ) is usually all that is required. Components are very good although the art is only OK being perhaps more functional than eye-candy.

As a former MTG player who doesn't care for long, drawn-own, brain burning battles or building a personal deck anymore...Wiz-War is just what the doctor ordered. 

Shared draw deck and a manageable set of base rules that can be explained to newcomers in 10 minutes. 

It's great fun knocking down an enemy wizard by destroying the wall they are standing next to, and then as they dust themselves off, telekinetically  moving them (against their will, of course) through their own fire wall they created the turn before.

This is a really cool, and original game. I can see why Richard Garfield ripped a bunch of ideas for MtG from this game. It's a lot of fun, and the deck mechanic just adds a lot of customization which keeps it from getting stale.

I would give it an 8 to 9 but i like it so much that i rate it with a 10.Its a game that you have to spent time on in order to have extreme plays.You are a wizard in a maze and with your crazy spells you have to make the best use of them and the terrain in order to score points,normal play is till 2 points,you get 1 point for each wizard you kill and 1 point for each treasure you steal from an opponent wizard and put it in your starting point,but this point isnt safe!others can steal it back.or be the last man standing!Good for 2,3,4 players,some say that 2 isnt good but i love it cause it turns out to an epic duel deathmatch!outsmarting your opponent.An experienced player will dominate a new one.Some said that it is to random to andicipate an enemies actions but it isnt.if you know all the spells(and i play with a full spell deck mixed) you can know what to expect from an opponent and understand what he has from his movements and actions.If you play it enough you will get that.A crazy duek game,lots of fan and strategy.Lots of rukes variety and the only disadvantage is that the rules arent that clear,you can misunderstand a lot of situations and dont know what to do,it comes down to common sense and an understanding between the players.So after some plays you have to be clear about some situations with the other players and all agree about them.Like epicness? like strategy and mayhem? haunting down your friends? or be the one to play smart in the shadows to steal treasures? this game is for you!

The venerable classic Wiz-War finally gets the reprint it deserves from Fantasy Flight (who else?). As with their reprint of Cosmic Encounter, I feel this is sure to be the definitive edition of the game for years to come. Rather than cards with simple text, the delightful illustrations perfectly compliment the detailed minis and scads of tokens. The production values are off-the-charts and really serve to streamline some of the accounting present in the game. 

Accounting? I thought this was a light, take-that battle game? Well, yes. Frankly, this game walks a tightrope of simply containing too much rules overhead for the amount of strategic decisions that can be made. As mentioned, the components in this edition (including carefully worded cards) ease some of this, but it has to be played in the right spirit. Most of the verbosity and complexity is there for thematic reasons, and the cards are often very intuitive in practice. For example, the card Lightning Bolt has so much text that the illustration is limited to less than half the space that illustrations occupy on other cards, yet once players know how it works, it really feels like a bolt of lightning is arcing all around the walls of the dungeon, zapping everything in its path. The joys of immuring someone behind a stone wall, transforming into a werewolf, or hitting someone with an enormous hammer are all here.

Mechanically, it's primarily a game of hand management, and there really are some brutal choices to make. Players who know the available cards will find this a deeper experience as they bluff and feint at certain well-worn gambits. Much like the best CCGs, it's very accessible to new players, and much of the strategy may be hidden deep within the various cards. But don't worry about that. Play for the fun and for the stories it creates and just enjoy the ride.

Quite possibly my favorite game, certainly for 3 players. Mysteriously underrated. Possible to have a good game with 2 or 4, but feels perfectly designed for 3.

It's great silly, chaotic & quick fun. Production value is top-notch, the theme is cool & once player know the cards, it plays really quick.

You should enjoy being mean to each other, setting traps, shooting fireballs & imprisoning players with magic walls is the main part of the game.
The rest is some tactics & racing.
A fun, light ameritrash game. :)

Reminded me a bit of king of tokyo, with spells instead of dice. But while KoT feels too random, in Wiz War you can actually do some cool planing & combos.

Even though the game is crying out for more expansions, I'm not a fan of the way FFG sells them. They could do away with the giant expansion box, and sell the contents in a zip-lock bag for 50% of the price.

The little brawls here and there are really fun but except for that the game feels a bit odd. The game is too technical, not much flow in there. Many rules, markers, options you never or rarely use. The catch & run and the brawl themes/mechanics feel kind of forced in this game - its none of the two.

Nice duel-type game. Great components, but some of them (hats, counters) looks surprisingly dated.

Instruction may be a little to long, and some rules are quirki, but I like in-your-face aspect of the game and highly aggressive game play.

Great re playability.

May be a little to random at times.

The classic magical dueling game...great components and tons of variety in the spell cards. The expansions add even more to an already fun game. New players take a bit to get the rhythm  and can get a little AP with all the spells flying around, but pick it up quickly. All the schools of magic make each wizard seem unique, yet all are well balanced.

Really hard to rate something like this off one quick play. I was eliminated fairly early but the game only last like 30 minutes so that's fine. Also it was hilarious and I accidentally killed myself when I was a cloud of mist. Things that worry me are how the game will hold up to repeated plays. Is it just the novelty that is making this game shine only to reveal a turd later on? Or is underneath all this glitz and glam something fun and enjoyable for years to come? If it's good I might do the PnP of the original because MF is OOP and I'd love to get more gameplay mechanics.

I haven't played this enough to know for sure yet, but Wiz-War seems to have a number of good tactical elements included, but bogs down a bit (especially with 2 players). It also seems hard to lay out a plan and execute it, given all the chaos and counterspells involved. I imagine the rating could increase using some of the optional (i.e. old school) rules, or with more people.

Update--plus the recently released expansions, Wiz-War shines for exactly what it is--an all out Wizard smackdown in a constantly shifting landscape. 

Especially with the expansions (but also with the base game), I'd recommend either the "Big Book o' Spells" variant, or the specializations variant introduced in Beastial Forces (where each wizard builds his/her own supplemental deck from one unused school of magic.

Un corre que te pillo con magos que utilizan hechizos de distintos saberes para combatir entre ellos y robarse los tesoros. Divertido y rápido, la gran cantidad de hechizos lo hace muy rejugable.

If I had a time machine, I would send this game to my 11-year-old self, and that young whippersnapper would be in gaming heaven. As it is, playing this is a pretty good way to feel like a (very geeky) kid again.

My rating of 10 is based on playing with both expansions and the "Giant Book of Spells" and "Uncluttered Minds" optional rules from the back of the rulebook. I would also like to try playing with the "Treasure Hunters" rule and to 3 or 4 points. With the base game and straight FFG rules, it's more like an 8.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2014)

Wiz-Wars can be a fun game if played with the correct group (casual), however I have come to dislike most “take that” games and Wiz-Wars is at heart a “take that” game. All the players will attack the perceived leader until one of them finally pulls through (mostly by luck) and wins the game. This mechanic, practically ensures a long game as VPs can be lost during the game. It also has a lot of uncontrollable luck with the cards with no way to mitigate it. Due to this, I believe it is best played with 2 players. With 3 players, two players will fight each other and let other one walks to the victory. With 4 players it is a free for all and everyone will attack the current leader. If I play with 4 players, I would like it to play it with teams.

The game feels a lot longer than it should be so at the end I’m mostly bored. It also features player elimination, that can be bad if someone dies at the beginning, it could be a couple of hours until the game finish.

On the good side, the components are great. The miniatures very well done and the art is also good. The theme is very enjoyable. 

Bottom line, Wiz Wars was revolutionary game for its time, but I no longer enjoy this kind of game (I would have loved it as a kid). I could perhaps play it again, but I won’t ever request it. Lots of chaos and uncontrollable luck. 

Current Rating: 5.0

I have changed a lot during the years and, as a consequence, I now always dislike games that have the (almost) pointless “bash the leader”, “take that” and “in your face” mechanics. I (mostly) no longer enjoy this type of game. Having saying that, lots of my friends enjoy Wiz-War, so I think there can be a good game here, but is definitively not a game for me.

RATING: 8
The BGG thread suggesting the removal of approximately 2/3 of the counterspells has breathed new life into a game that was a borderline dud out of the box. 

It now feels like just the right balance between racing around the board and deathmatch. You can actually hope to hurt people with your spells, as opposed to seeing them inevitably canceled, dodged, or turned back against you. 

Quick and light enough so that dying early isn't bad at all. It's great to see another old classic brought back for wide release.

Bought this because the FLGS had it on offer, but it really took me by surprise. This game is a lot of fun and 2 player version works well (unlike what others have said). Also plays fast and furious. Very random ameritrashy FUN!! Note: I have not played the old version, but this one is pretty solid, even though (in FFG style), the cards are very unclear in certain situations. But what would a Fantasy Flight Game be without a massive FAQ?

played twice, but both times with 2 players.  Will rate once I get to play with 3 or 4.  So far, I like it well enough.  Its still an Ameritrash that is very chaotic, but there is fun to be had amidst the chaos. 

Ultimately, it didn't quite make it into the permanent collection. Good, but forgettable, really.  Maybe the ninth edition?  lol

Interesting concept but this games flaws exceed its strengths.  Each game we've played so far has ultimately come down to each player running immediately for each other's treasures and the winner usually getting two treasures.  There is minimal interaction/attacking between players because the board is simply too big and allows for the treasure strategy.  On the other hand, there is the potential for player elimination if there is encouraged battling and this is an absolute no-no for me.

See my [thread=768436]review[/thread].

The more I've talked to people about this game since writing that review, the more frustrated I've become at FFG for making so many rules changes.  I've kind of backed off from my earlier view that it would be great to have it back in print; they've made such a mess of it, as far as having to agree on exactly what bundle of optional rules you're going to use, every time you play with someone outside your usual group, that I'm... [i]almost[/i] wishing they hadn't reprinted it.  It didn't have to be that way.  (If you only ever play with the same group of friends, that won't matter to you.)

In Wiz-War, wizards wage no-spells-barred magical duels deep in an underground labyrinth. This classic board game of magical mayhem for 2-4 players, created by Tom Jolly in 1983, pits players' wizards against each other in a stupendous struggle for magical mastery. Win by stealing other wizards' treasures and hauling them back to your base, or just score points by blasting the other wizards. The last wizard standing always wins.Staying true to the spirit of the game that has entertained players for years, as well inspiring an entire genre of games, this 2011 edition of Wiz-War caters to the imagination and the funny bone. Casting an enriched array of spells, your wizards race through an underground maze, avoiding fireballs, werewolves, and psychic storms. Subtle game enhancements by Kevin Wilson and Tom Jolly promote faster play and clarify card effects.

This game is light and interesting. It has some similarities with Dungeon twister for the tile layout and victory conditions, but you only control 1 character and it does not have a chess feel like dungeon twister.

My complaints so far is that a lot of cards would require energy cards, but you never happen to have too few of them. I know that it could break the game if having too much.

Second, sometimes the game end short. You feel that you would like to play more. It's not so bad because you could start a 2nd game, but it's like if you did not had the time to do everything you wanted.

I'll be curious to see what expansions will have to offer. Still, the game seems flexible enough to be able to play in different ways than capturing chess. That could add good replay value.

Okay, so this is random, chaotic, and can take a long for what the game involves.  I still had a blast in my first play.  Just had fun playing around with the different spells and abilities, trying to take out my opponents, thieving stuff, building walls to block people (oh wait, I never drew a wall card...:-)  ).  Lots of variety to the spells as you only play with as many schools of magic as there are players (there are 6-7 schools of magic at this point).  Looks like another expansion driven game.  Fantasy Flight looks to have done a nice job reprinting this classic.

I love games where your long term strategy planning is worth shit, because they game itself changes in unexpected and unpredictable ways. Wiz-War is the boiled down essence of such a game. Random card draws, the board itself changes during the game, and all sorts of crazy card interactions can make your winning thrust a losing sputter. I'm still on the fence about how much I love this game, but love it I do. The sheer volume of card interactions makes Wiz-War a game that needs to be plumbed (like Cosmic Encounter) to get the full effect, and I plan on plumbing it for a long time to come. The component quality is top notch, as always from FFG, and the artwork is a nice departure from a company that seems to have one graphic designer who has one trick up his sleeve.

Combos, misdirection, and deceit! Our group had a seriously good time and played twice, back to back. Both games were entirely different. Managing your hand and recognizing the opportunities you have with what cards you were dealt is important to your success.

This new edition is fantastic.  The spells are goofy and widely variable, changing the experience each time.  There's a very classic feel to this game: not as polished as Dungeon Twister or Magic, but still delightful in its causal carnage.  I can easily play a few games of this in a row.

Maybe it's because I played the pretty obviously inferior 2-player game rather than the potentially more chaotic and tactical 3-4 player version, but this mostly just struck me as old-fashioned and grind-y. Lovely cards and game pieces, though.

Played solo with many of the counter spells removed. Of the 4 characters one had 7 health after round 1 and another had 5. Then the carnage dropped back as more cards were collected and treasures were sought. The spells are varied and interesting. Good game.

To my mind, this brings out the best and worst of Ameritrash. It REQUIRES house-ruling and seasoning to taste. There are corner cases that need interpretation and a pile of chits and cards to sort. It's possible to have a string of turns that feel uneventful due to countered attacks.

I thought I would hate Wiz-war, but with fast, flexible players, I've had memorable experiences. I'm wary of how close the game veers toward being disasterly un-fun, so my rating might be generous, but I'm pleased so far. I'm definitely not seeking out any expansions though.

Thoughts after 1 game - enjoyed game alot - Very chaotic - I had seen a couple of reviews saying that Fantasy flight had changed the rules and that it was hard to kill an opponents wizard, They advised playing with the original rules (all the cards go into the draw pile,items/objects created had be removed be caster at will - still only 1 attack per turn) - Played with this variant and after about 5 or 6 rounds all 3 wizards were on the verge of death with not a single healing card to be seen. Will obviously have to play more to see if it was a one off - But what a crazy fun game - had to buy expansion and will probably paint all thr figures

The game is lighthearted, humorous and crazy.

Components are standard FFG - which crushes my old 4th edition version like a bug.

No reason to expect much of a change overall - will probably be a 7 also, like the original.  Wiz-war is simply light fun, not deep strategy.  The game is ruined by people who insist on pondering all their actions.

After a solid 10 plays this is the best Wiz-War to date easy.  The card and deck choices mix it up and make it even more replayable.  The game has been quick for us, typically 30 minutes for our 4P games.  Lots of action and silliness.  The FFG components certainly add to the experience.

Magical chaos in a box! With a bunch of different spell schools with all sorts of silly comboes, map changes, and lovely little models for transformations, this game is a delight to play if you have some time to kill with three other friends.
I will say that you shouldn't play this game with less than the maximum 4. It needs that number of players to add to the chaos which really brings this game to life.

Wizards in a dungeon, twatting each other with spells and stealing loot. New FFG rules make it too much of a race, but old rules are included. Much better when you weed out the 'no you don't!' type cards and more spells ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING.

Plays the right length for the weight of the game and gives me the 'let's go again!' feel. Nice components, but more cynical than usual with the inevitable expansion; the rules define a term and state that it's not in the base game. Hmph. I liked it enough to paint all the pieces!

The base rules were very easy to learn BUT the complex relationships between so many cards that all break the basic rules made the game frustrating. Each turn devolved into looking up card conflicts on line. In the end the game has all the same rules problems as MTG but doesn't have the large fan base to make it easy to find players. I will introduce this game to my MTG friends, if they like it it will have a future if not I will trade it away.

RATING: 7
I have played the Chessex version of this game for a long, long time (1985ish).  The components were pretty marginal back then.  The game was always a blast especially with 3 or 4 players.  We even combined cards and sets to make 5 - 8 player games.

Some games were over quickly others took an eternity.  In one of our games an opponent was blind for 4 turns, paralyzed for another 6, and finally locked inside walls/stone for another 10 or more turns.  Believe it or not Chris still ended up winning... Nuts.

I believe Tom Jolly has wanted to get this back in print for a long time already and I am REALLY glad Fantasy Flight has picked it up.

At first I didn't really care for the spacey themed game board but it has already grown on me a bit.

I love that this edition includes the original Chessex rules (without some of the expansion material it seems) as options.  This is exactly the kind of stuff I always want to see from Fantasy Flight regarding reprints.  Kudos for working with the original designer.

Someday, I am still going to finish casting my Hirst Art Molds for the game to do this fully 3D..

Update after one play (I am going to have to re-read the rules to make sure I have the following correct):  

1) I don't really care for the new vp end game system.  It is pretty easy to get a treasure on your home square.  Taking one player out ends things.  Anticlimatic.  As such I think the game is way better played with the old victory conditions i.e get two opponents treasures on your home square and/or eliminate all opposition.

2) I really miss the rule: lose both your treasures to opponents home bases and your wizard goes poof...imo it made the game tension escalate and provided a lot of interesting decisions which are now missing.  I would heavily recommend using this optional rule (if you don't mind player elimination).

3) We played with the entire magic deck combined and it seemed to work fine.

4) In the old rules permanents didn't need to be maintained (except stones which were played onto your display).  It seems all permanents need to be maintained now... as such I feel interesting/fun items like thornbushes are way less useful now.  The clutter they provided as a permanent on the board was always a good thing.  It was even better when an ill placed item hurt the original caster.

5) The teleport spell might need a house-rule (we did this in the old version as well) / for some reason I thought it was an official rule from previous sets.  In our findings it is simply too powerful.  

Probably the easiest way is to add: you can use the teleport spell instead of moving...       

Otherwise you can move, add an energy card for additional movement, and then still teleport four squares.  In my experience this usually means game over.

6) The boards and components are WAY prettier, but seem to be less clear than in previous versions.  I absolutely HATE ERRATA and there is already a FAQ.. The game has been around for long enough to hopefully have avoided this.  I wish more attention to detail was given prior to re-releasing.

7) I will absolutely have to play it a few more times to form a better opinion.  Regardless of my above comments I am really glad it is back in print!!  Wiz-War deserves a new audience.  Definitely chaotic but very, very, very fun.

Edit: the more I think about the thought which was put into this new edition the more I appreciate it.  Rating moved to an 8.

Fast-paced, action-packed and chaotic, Wiz-War (8th ed) is an excellent take-that labyrinth-movement and card-driven game that constantly alters between cat-and-mouse pursue/evade and aggressive turn-the-table one-upmanship direct confrontation of physical smacking, attack spells, and unexpected counters. Short session times, relatively easy rules with tactical richness and extreme player interaction makes this an excellent game whenever three or four players wants an adrenaline rush where skill and fortune rewards the brave equally.

Just received this (I also have a well played 5th edition). Haven't had a chance to play with friends yet, but I can tell I am going to love it, just playing a through turns solo. This is the very definition of a respectful, classy reissue. And about time, I'd say. Congrats to all involved. Edit: I have been able to play, numerous times, and I love it. I would suggest using the optional rules, particularly the ones from the classic game. Treasure Hunters is a must for me. This game being out in a really nice edition is a godsend.

Well, I'm shocked. I went into this thinking I'd loathe it--and perhaps I would have had it taken the listed 75 minutes--but I actually enjoyed the experience. The rules are straightforward, the cards diverse, and there's a nice mix of hand management, spatial play, and confrontation/combat. There's certainly luck in what cards you draw when, but part of the game is just going along for the ride. Besides, there's enough basic tactical play and consistency to the win conditions that this doesn't feel like you're playing Fluxx. Not bad. I'd play again, but don't get too excited.

An instant favorite with the group. The first game we played, someone got eliminated *really* early on and ended up being super salty for the rest of the night; even so, this is one of their favorite games now. Definitely fun! (However, we think that the blue wizard is at a disadvantage due to how many squares it takes to get out of their sector).
Update: We still love this game. I bought the Bestial Forces expansion. I highly recommend removing some of the counter spells because they really damper the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Apparently re-imagined from the Games Workshop original, Wiz-War 8th works like a cross between Frag and Magic: The Gathering. The result is a fairly satisfying medium weight game where players take turns to move around and cast spells with the aim of eliminating other wizards and stealing their treasure chests.

The basic idea is pretty simple, but with so many different spell cards featuring complex and varying effects newbie players may find themselves a little overwhelmed to begin with. This also bogs down the fun factor a little as AP weighs the game down heavier then it should be.

I'm also not a huge fan of the treasure chest collecting side of the game- moving chests around tends to take up more time then actually casting spells does and feels a little disappointing (I want to have a Wiz-War, not a Chest-War)!

I suspect as you get more plays under your belt Wiz-War will become easier and quicker to play.

Thematic, litigation heavy duel of wits as much as magic combos, as players must manage a hand of spells that may do all but enable direct combat.

Much rules and ability overhead for beginners but a fun, unique experience.

This game is an all out war mixed with capture the flag. The overall flow of the game is unpredictable which makes it a blast. Throw master strategies aside and look to change your tactics from turn to turn. It is super fun. Getting up to speed with all the rules and how the cards work isn't as straightforward as I normally like in games, but it isn't that bad either. After a play or two most of the rules and how the cards work can be easily understood. The components are amazing and make you feel right at home as a battling wizard.

RATING: 6
Wiz-War is a tough game to rate. For everything I like about it, there's one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb. Probably the biggest downside is the player elimination, which I think is one of those mechanisms that is cool to hate on these days, but it's still something that should have been modernized by Fantasy Flight. Maybe respawn wizards on death and up the kill count to 3? I dunno, just spit-balling ideas.

Still, this is an older game, and you have to be in that mindset when you play. The older variant rules found at the back of the rule book do seem to make the game better than it would be otherwise. Not using all the spells in every game, for instance, probably balances things out more, but makes the game far less exciting. I like being able to throw out a spell that no one saw coming, and then cackling maniacally. Just be aware that it can lead to a similar vibe seen in Munchkin games, where one person gets really great cards and others may not.

As for the game itself, I found it to be very fresh for an older design. I love the fact that you can flat out destroy walls, doors, and other objects. In doing so, however, you not only make a door for yourself, but for your opponents as well. It's a really interesting concept that I wish was in more games. The movement seems a bit too streamlined for my tastes though. I almost wish you could roll a d6, or at the very least have a deck of cards to dictate your movement options. Despite that, this is one of those games that creates many memorable moments, and those are my favorite kinds of games. In my first game, for instance, one person turned into a giant, and started smacking another wizard through walls until they were about crippled.

So why do I rate the game so low? Well, aside from some rough edges that most Fantasy Flight re-prints seem to get smoothed out being obviously absent, I wish that there was more happening on the board. Being in this huge maze with only four characters running around makes for a less cutthroat experience, although I'm sure veterans would say otherwise. I'm eyeing one of the expansions that adds in creatures to summon, as I think this would push me over the fence into the camp of liking this game. It's not without its faults, but Wiz-War embodies so much of what I like about board gaming that I want to like it more than I do.

The game becomes much more about running around and casting fun spells, rather than worrying about counter-spells and racing to see who gets the treasures back to their base first.

I also own the Malefic Curses and Bestial Forces expansions.

My gaming group and I have been in a bit of a slump lately when it comes to finding a new game we all like and then came along Wiz-War! It took only two rounds before we had the rules down and the game became very competitive and crazy fun. I'm not a huge fan of the card artwork but that is a minor issue. The game played so differently each time and there's nothing better then screwing over your friends! Great game.

Blah, blah, blah, elegant game balance... your argument is invalid.

You are wizards, locked in a steel-cage death-match, and you're given a choice to win: Blast the unholy hell out of your opponents, or steal their treasures.  No part of this game is not designed to be fun.  It plays with a carefree, almost Tom Wham-like ridiculousness.  It's essentially Team Fortress 2 with spells.  And it's relatively quick, so when you ARE blown out of the water it's not too long before the re-match.  My nephews will LOVE this.

I like the separate schools-of-magic decks, which give you 120 combinations out the gate... and knowing FFG, there's more to come.  (UPDATED 5/28/15: They're here.  And they're wonderful.)

Finally, my favorite thing about this edition is that it short-circuits FFG's hardest failing: the rulebook.  This game is designed to be messy.  There's going to be a 900-page FAQ for the people who need it.  But the informal "pick whichever effect is cooler" rule works just as well.

I bought this one for myself for my birthday. I'm glad I did, as I really enjoy it. Most players apparently like to use the "both of your treasures are stolen, you lose" mechanic, but that would always end up with me losing, so I don't. I think this would be really fun with 6 or 8 players. Somehow.

Ordered this almost instantly after having learned about it. Obviously, the game has all I need for a good time: Simple rules, fighting for no reason at all, schadenfreude, randomness - just perfect.

On the rule book - terrible, just terrible. How is it possible to expalain simple rules in such a bloated manner?!


MY COMMENTS IN GERMAN, TAKEN FROM WWW.UNKNOWNS.DE

2015-01-12: Kurz gesagt: Das Spiel ist genau mein Ding! Einfach herumrennen, verrückte Sachen machen und Mitspieler stressen. Total chaotisch und lustig, und dabei kurz genug, um nicht zu langweilen. Über mehrere Stunden wäre die Geschichte nicht mehr lustig, denn natürlich ist das "nur" seichte, trashige Unterhaltung a la Roborally, Dungeonquest oder Munchkin (das eben genau deswegen nervt, weil es für ein Spiel dieser Kategorie viel zu lange dauert) -- oder vielleicht auch wie Cosmic Encounter? Ich bin nicht ganz sicher, ob insbesondere der letzte Vergleich wirklich hinhaut, aber vom Spielgefühl her musste ich fast sofort an Cosmic Encounter daran denken. Dass Wiz-War im Grunde genommen eher Magic the Gathering mit Spielbrett in einer Leichtversion ist, das ist offensichtlich. MtG habe ich zwar nicht gespielt, dafür aber für kurze Zeit einmal seinen Star-Trek-Klon; von daher glaube ich schon sagen zu können, dass das Spielgefühl bei MtG vermutlich ein ganz anderes sein wird als bei Wiz-War. Wiz-War ist einfach entspannt und lustig und geht auch noch nach ein paar Bier.... also ein Beer-and-Pretzel-Game, wie die Amis sagen würden. Die Regeln sind in typischer FFG-Manier wieder viel zu lange geraten und lassen absurderweise trotzdem noch einige Unklarheiten offen. Das macht aber nichts. Bei diesem Spiel würde ich bei einem Regelkonflikt einfach den Zufall bestimmen lassen, welche Auslegung zählt.

Wir haben das ja nur zu zweit gespielt (gleich noch ne Revanche hinterher), von daher ist dieser Eindruck sicher noch wandelbar. Aber wenn das zu zweit schon so cool ist, dann muss es mit vier Spielern eigentlich richtig abgehen. Da ich persönlich kein Problem mit Königsmacherei, Koalieren und Backstabben habe, und auch nicht mit Spielereliminierung bei kurzer Spieldauer, sind meine Sorgen sehr gering, von Wiz-War doch noch enttäuscht zu werden.

Fun, reminds me a bit of the mechanics re-used in Frag, just without dice.

Has similarities to Magic the Gathering (no wonder, since this game was an inspirational source for that game).

Most fun with 4 players.

I enjoyed it more than the original. It's still basically draw cards, use what you get, play cards to inflict damage on others, try and not get beaten up yourself. At least here there are new card sets to mix and match to generate different types of games, and the energy element implementation seems neater as well.

I never played the original, but enjoyed the FFG version (2 player). I can see where Magic the Gathering may have gotten some ideas from the original. 

I like the variety of cards which players draw into their hands. The issue I have is the winner is the player who gets 2 points (1 point per treasure, 1 point per wizard kill). Maybe the game would drag on too long if the points were more, just seems like very few points to win a game.

This was a hit; it's also hilarious. Seems best with a full complement of four wizards.

2 Plays - This game is definitely better with max players. A capture the flag type, 'tavern' brawl game (except you're dueling wizards). It's quite chaotic with quite a lot of take-that styled luck built in. However, this is definitely the experience that the game is going for and it achieves its overall purpose pretty well. It's fairly light, crazy with frequent 'wow' moments that will keep you entertained. The replayability is pretty good, with the ability to create different a draw deck made of different combinations of magically themed spells (that ultimately produce mayhem in different ways).

If I was playing with more less serious/ non-gamers I'd be happy to pull this off the shelf for a laugh, but otherwise not the type of game I generally reach for i.e. a game that favours random effects (or who gets least picked on) determining the winner, as opposed to being heavy on strategic decision making.

RATING: 4
Really not my type of game. You get three movements and you walk around a labyrinth trying to kill the other wizards by casting spells. You have a hand of cards with spells, items and other such effects and you simply try to steal their treasures to bring them back to your base or kill them. I can see that it is short and simple, but really dull, you simply play what you can when you can and there is little to know strategy.

After hearing the guys at the Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast raving about this game I thought it deserved a place in my collection.

The basic premise is that each player controls a wizard whos goal it is to prove themselves the champion in a wizardly contest.  To do this players either need to kill off the opposing wizards or steal their treasures and return them to the home base.  The way this is done is by playing from your hand of randomly dealt spell cards from a frankly huge selection.  The fun of the game is trying to find ways to combo these spell cards to find sneaky and creative ways of achieving your goals and preventing your opponents from achieving theirs.

The whole game is completely random and chaotic but also plays quite quickly so bad luck on the initial card draw doesn't really matter too much.

Had some fun with this although not sure of the fit for my game group.  There is a lot of card text to read and a huge volume of different spells so our first few games have been somewhat bogged down whilst we determine what does what.  I think however the more you play this game and the more familiar you get with the cards, the better the game will become.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good variety of cards and maps makes each game slightly different.  Have added some house rules so people don't just go around stealing treasure, which makes the game a little more action oriented.  The more wizards playing the better the game will be.

It's goofy and when certain combos come up, it can be incredibly hilarious. Playing it with Magic players is all the better. It works equally well with all player counts. I would suggest looking into the "optional" variants section though as some of those rules take the game up a full notch, especially the cast spells don't affect hand limit and a spell once cast is out of your control. It's once again FFG messing with rules they probably shouldn't have messed with.

The components are pretty nice, I just wish they continued to support this beyond the first 2 expansions. Not that the game doesn't feel complete per se, but a 6th player and additional schools of magic would have been great.

I have no nostalgia for this game. It has held up well over the many years and I look forward to more plays of it.

Rating is 10 when including the expansions and using variant rules. It's much closer to an 8 when using FFG's ruleset and no expansions.

I thought this game would be good, but I didn't count on it being excellent. If you like ameritrash you will find this to be a jewel of random fun. Best played in 4, it has all the ingredients for fun: exquisite figures, lots of tokens and tons of cards. Easy rules, doesn`t take too much time and works well with less experienced players. Many ways of foiling your opponents' plans, lots of spells which you can increase in power. Good combos can leave the other players wandering what the hell just happened, and how they managed to lose the game when all they needed was to take two more steps to win. It just screams for an expansion which I would buy the next day it comes out! A game which manages to be random without the use of dice chucking.

So much fun playing this game !!

This game is chaos and that's what makes it so amazing !!

The game looks random at first, but there is lot of depth in the hand / deck building management aspects.

Sure you can throw out random spells left and right, but good players will still be able to out perform you.

This is a knowledge game, meaning: you need to know what can be done and what combinations of spells works together.

Also, this is a game that rewards creativity.

A classic made even better with this version. Components are amazing and love the pace of each games !! Fun fun fun !!

A fun, beer and pretzels game. It plays quick enough that several games can be played in an evening. I enjoy the separation of the 'schools of magic' into different decks. Each has a special flavor and mixing the different combinations has resulted in games with a unique feel. I expect (and hope) there are expansions with additional decks. The games can be pretty wild so, even though there is almost continuous combat, there isn't a great deal of planning available.

After hearing some negative things about the game, including criticism that it's too luck-based, I tried for myself and...it's definitely not bad.

Yeah, it can be kind of chaotic, but it's really well-done for a chaotic game. Deciding how to use your cards is not mindless, and there are some pretty cool card interactions to find and use. The rules are somewhat vague in certain places, but not in a game-breaking way.

One complaint: when playing with the base rules, it can be maybe a bit too easy to just avoid everyone else and steal two treasures quickly before anyone can fight you. For those that hate the idea of losing because someone ran away, I suggest using one of the more combat-oriented mods in the back of the rulebook.

Tentative rating: 8/10

EDIT: Played a game in which one wizard dealt 4 damage to another wizard one time, and then nobody was able to damage anyone for the rest of the game. Everyone just ran around trying to steal each other's treasure, and when I finally decided to cause chaos by all-out attacking anyone I could find, everyone had counterspells to stop all the damage I tried to deal. The winner never attacked anyone all game. That's a bummer.

May 2012: Upgraded from 7 to 9. Best-in-its-class take-that game.

What separates this from the rest? Lots of opportunities for collusion; very, very easy-to-explain rules (considering how much of a luck fest this game is); and you get to move a dude through a maze. It's not simply about inflicting hit points or amassing VPs. (Well, it is all about that, but it's so much more straightforward.)


From the surface, Wiz-War is devoid of any strategy and looks like only a take-that game. And when you play it, it is exactly that. There's a lot of text on all the cards, so the game slows down because players are always reading cards. Definitely not my type of game, but for some reason I really enjoy it! I think it appeals to my childhood love of mazes! Perhaps it's the combination of really short playing time, high luck factor, pure spitefulness, combined with visual factor -- it's amusing to give multiple points of damage to a player, but it's event more amusing to block an opponent by putting up a wall or rotating a part of the maze!

Still can't decide if this was a good buy. Wizards shooting fireballs at each other, conjuring thorn bushes and magical walls sounds awesome, but game play really needs to be faster and tighter. I guess familiarity with the spells would do the trick, but for now, my gaming group spends too much time reading the cards that the fireballs now just fizzles out of their wands. Somewhere in there is a great game where wizards conjure and curse their way to victory, I just need more time to find it.

Wiz-War is a fun, silly game.  One cannot have too much attachment for the game as it is being played as there is a lot of luck involved.

Wiz-War is light, super chaotic and takes about as long to play is it takes to set it up. Normally this would equal a game I don't like very much but there's definitely fun to be had while players are slinging spells at one another. I was worried about the balance of all the different schools of magic but I think I enjoyed them all pretty equally. A ton of neat ideas implemented here and quite a few variants available in case any number of mechanics don't feel right to your group. Very enjoyable.

26-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. I played an incomplete game a while back, but now played a full 3 player game. 

In Wiz-War you are wizards, running around and trying to steal treasures. Each turn, you can move 3 steps and use one attack spell. The game is extremely light, but a fun excersize in futility.

It's a little more complicated than Drakon, a bit longer and about as much fun. To me, it seems Wiz-War has aged and new games do what it did better. It's a light, enjoyable game. But do not expect much depth!

Wacky, chaotic fun running around a maze zapping each other.  The ending can be a bit anti-climactic for some players, as if you don't have the right cards, it can be impossible to get around the board quickly enough to have any role in preventing a player from winning. It seems like it's definitely best with 4 players, and the original rules are probably better, just to have more variety of cards.  My main complaint is that there are not more ways to draw more cards, some way where you could discard cards to draw extra cards, etc. to allow you to better manage your card flow - only drawing 2 cards per turn and being unable to get rid of low quality cards that you draw (you can discard them, but get no benefit from doing so unless you are hitting your hand limit) means that you are very much limited by the quality of the cards you draw.  The winner will usually be the one who just drew better cards (and perhaps that the other players weren't able to tell had better cards and thus he didn't get beat on enough).

Fell flat for me: too random and shallow. I knew it advance that it wasn't strategic; I had been hoping for simple fun instead, but the constant questions about what the cards did got in the way (admittedly, I was playing with non-native speakers).

re: More players

You can make a copy of the four boards in the base game and mount them onto cardboard. You'll have to see for yourself if there are enough *cards* to support however many additional players. There may be, since it looks like with the "colors" system, you're only using subset of cards for a typical game.

RATING: 5
Own the game and the expansion. This game has somehow found itself in an uncanny valley. It's too complex to be a casual beer & pretzel game with all the text on spell cards and their interpretation, yet at the same time too simple to be be enjoyable for me.

Requires too much house-ruling for my comfort. Very chaotic but not a whole lot of strategy I think.

Playing 5 player I suggest NOT using the deadly treasures variant and perhaps playing to 3 points instead of 2.

Update: **Traded**

The best games feel like play, and Wiz-War does so with the fewest rules and overhead of any of them. It's a wizard death-matches in board game form, and it's surely one of the purest games I've played. Just a terrific pick-up-and-play game, where a second game always feels like a given. It's helped by an outstanding production from Fantasy Flight, which stands beside Cosmic Encounter, Talisman, and Merchant of Venus as their finest reprint work ever.

Wow, I love this category of games. direct, in your face conflict, that's what the name of the game is here. I allow/enforce each player taking a single deck of cards, one person being the Necromancer, for e.g., and either just doing that, or also allowing the rest of the cards to go into a communal pile. It adds more flavor. I've also dumped a lot of the protection, healing, and counterspell cards, so that each player has (I think) 20 cards. Or is that 22? Anyway, I took out like 3-5 cards from each deck, replacing them with the 'cantrip' cards where necessary to get each deck to the same number. Anyway, it all adds up to more brutal more fun.

This and Conquest of Planet Earth (played competitive mode) are my favorite 'take that' games. So much opportunities for multiplayer screwage, so much delight.

Fun little game of wizards raging through a maze. A huge variety of cards and items grants an endless replayability.

Still, the core set suffers a little because of a non-perfect wording of a few cards, and an excessive presence of counterspells that tend to water down the action a little. Nonetheless, a great game, that becomes even better with the expansions in.

Rating reflects one game played with 3. With three the wizard who could avoid conflict benefited greatly in the same way that in three player Risk a player outside of a conflict will have an edge. 

With that said I thought this game was totally cool, and would probably be a blast with 4. The cards were really interesting and I enjoyed the high level of conflict this game encouraged. I'd like to try it again with 4, but not with 3.

Hilarious!

I dug the theme in the first place, and the zany card-play (to cast spells) and furious capture-the-flag gameplay sold me immediately.

The game itself is trivially simple. Get any 2 of capturing treasure or killing wizards. Then it's all the interaction of card text (spells). There are so many different spells, and many can be alternatively used as Energy to boost your other spells and make them more powerful, making for some interesting combos. Cast as many spells as you want on your turn as long as you only cast one attack, then watch the fireworks fly!

Card text and some zany concepts (like eating walls, or switching gravity on and off) contribute to a ludicrously stirring narrative that makes me LOL hard. I haven't LOLed so hard in a game for a long time, and this is the rare game where I sometimes jump in the fray and go for the cheap LOL instead of going for the win by sneaking my 2nd treasure back.

Do have to play with others who get into the fast-and-furious spirit and enjoy the chaos of all the spells flying all over the place. Killjoys who pore repeatedly through card text, question rulings (instead of just doing what makes sense), take forever to optimize a 2-card play, and are bothered by awesome fireworks should stay away.

4+4

Not elegant, not simple, nothing clever about it, yet easy to learn and intuitive. And stupid. Totally stupid. If stupid seems like fun, you'll love this. 
About strategy: Strategy schmategy, who needs strategy when you've got fireball? Impulse control was never a strong point for a wizard. 

It's a game about wizards running around the place and this place is a maze and the maze has several obstacles and others are user generated. It's about getting 2 treasures of other people or killing other people, whichever comes first. The great thing about it is that while it looks to be revolving around a giant deck of take that cards there's actually a bit of sandbox feel. Probably because cards can combo and counter one another. And it's an old game - loose mishmash of stuff thrown together,unregulated multiplayer combat, player elimination and refreshing sense of directness. 

About FFG reprint. I love the lighthearted style of artwork which looks much more uniform and original than in many FFG games. FFG decided to make their own version, as they do, but one can play the old game with some changes (labeled as variants) and back side of the boards. I've only played the classic game with all the old rules and I like it this way. Maybe I'll do some tweaking with counterspells as the game seemed to drag just a little bit. But as any olde design it's meant to be tweaked.

RATING: 7.5
FFG doing what they do well: taking an existing game, glossing it over with flash graphics and stuffing it all in a big box!

Silly, random, Ameritrash goodness.

You play a Wizard trying to move across a dungeon to steal two of your opponents treasures and take them back to home base (essentially a 'capture the flag' variant). The heart of the game really lies in the cards you hold These are 'spells' or weapons you can use to attack other players, change the layout of the dungeon etc.

Fun in its time but gameplay might be too random for the modern Eurogamer.

Ready to place this game among my favorites (9 rating) IF playing with certain optional rules from the old version, and with the expansions mixed in, particularly Bestial Forces

[hr]This game doesn't always perform the way you want it to. It has a noticeable "defective play" rate. Luckily, the less interesting games are usually also over quickly so they definitely don't ruin a whole night in the way a longer game that fizzles can.

On the other side of the spectrum are the Wiz-War games that drag on too long. Players who take too long to do their turns can really bring this game down a few notches.

When this game is at its best though its really, really, fun.

The whole "death match in a corridor + capture the flag" style of gameplay is pretty unique for a board game, and I'm unlikely to turn a game of this down.

Replay Value: It's better than I thought it would be after my first couple of plays -- but this game still seems at its best when you don't overplay it.

[b]2 Player:[/b] Not the same game, since winning by treasures is almost impossible unless the other player is asleep. Game becomes a light death match game. I'd rather play something else.
[b]3 player:[/b] Great. Plays fast.
[b]4 player:[/b] Awesome, but needs fast players!
[b]5 player[/b]: Awesome, but needs fast players!

I went in with zero expectations and came out quite impressed!  The components are stellar but its the gameplay that I was worried about -- and it really shines.  It's a race game with a lot of fun thrown in along the way.  If there was some way to eliminate player elimination (I really dislike that mechanic) it would be a purchase. *UPDATE* - Because it doesn't happen early and the game is usually quite quick, I've decided I like the game quite a bit and player elimination is no longer a concern.

Wiz-War is fast-paced, chaotic, and ultimately a lot of fun.  Playing with four people is great, since it just adds to the chaos factor (something I quite enjoy).

The biggest criticism I have for this game (and really any game with this feature) is that once you are killed there's nothing left for you to do but watch the game finish out.  It's not as bad in Wiz-War because the games are reasonably short, even with 4 players, but I still think it's a crappy mechanic.

Still only played with 4 of the spells decks, so far. The game seems slower than I expected it to be, but there is still a lot of AP. I have a feeling that as you become more knowledgable of the spells and combinations, the game will speed up quite a bit. Never going to be a thinky strategy game, but with a faster pace, it will probably play better.

I thought my son would like this so we played at a meet up.  He didn't care for it too much...didn't help that all of the action was focused on another section of the board far from him so he didn't get to interact with the rest of us.  My wife doesn't like games that require her to read lots of cards with varying abilities and be aware of what other players can do with their cards to counter (AP sets in).

Game looks great, but I am not sure either my son or wife will ask to play it again.

An amusing battle game driven by decks of cards, with lots of variety of potential spells and effects. The game comes with 6 different decks, and you use 3 each game, so there's a nice amount of potential variety.
Gameplay is generally fast and fun. A few flaws though; first, it seems like the game was deliberately split into multiple sets, since we have a bunch of cards that work on 'creatures' and talk about summoning creatures, but there are no cards that summon creatures! Second, damaging another player does nothing for you directly unless you deal the last point of damage. I've never liked this in any game; the reward for happening to be the one to deal the last point is way too big. Most likely, you'll expend lots of effort attacking another player, then just give someone else the point. Third, player elimination is a downside.

2 vs Team variant:
Players play in teams of 2 and combine their scores. You can't get a point from an ally's treasure. Play to 3 points. If a mage is eliminated, the opposing team scores 1 point and the mage respawns at full health on their next turn.

Painted: 0/4

This game is awesome.  It's like playing one of those multi-player shooter games in deathmatch mode but in a dungeon with wizards casting spells.  Lots of fun, lots of interaction, lots of cool cards.  This game is random and chaotic so if you want to bring strategy and tactics then forget it.  Sit back, kill wizards, steal treasure, and have fun.

I've never played the old version but the new FFG one is great.  Terrific components and a beautiful presentation.

A remake of an 80's classic game. Fantasy Flight does their usual thing of adding a bunch of bells and whistles and making everything prettier, but retains the rule arguments that made up a major portion of the game.

Ameritrash in it's purest form. A board, some miniatures and lots of cards that you slap on the table, slapping around your friends with a large trout in the process. Or whatever tickles your fancy. Wild and uncontrollable. Don't expect strategic thinking. But expect tons of hilarity. Oh, and expect to get lots of the little fiddly rules wrong. But don't get yourself wound up over that, it's normal and part of the play. If you can just roll with it, it will be a great experience. No game for rule-sticklers and people who want to outthink their opponents.

This is such a silly, crazy little game. It's very random, but that doesn't discourage my antirandom game playing friends from sitting down with me and battling over treasures. If you take your life too seriously and bring that mantality into your boardgaming, do not buy this. For everyone else, at least give it a try, it's worth it.

The game is all about tactics, card knowledge/counting and being sneaky not to let on what you have. There are so many fun combos in the spells that the game doesn't seem like it will get stale after many plays.

The rules are actually a LOT clearer than people are complaining about. If you have a background in playing magic cards you will not have a problem interpriting the rules.

Looking forward to expansions that offer different schools of magic.

Too chaotic for my taste. The cards are numerous and have lots of fine print to wade through. The mechanisms and turn execution in a game this chaotic should be more straightforward.

A game with high confrontation among players, which I don't mind. However, the game could take way too long to end. The interaction of the card is neat and the game itself is easy to learn, though the cards require more knowledge to become familar.

A solid game, I just wish it had a fixed trigger for a end game like number of rounds, to make sure the game wouldn't take too long.

After three short and meh games, I lowered the rating in 0.5 point, since the plays weren't properly awful, but really mediocre.

Played with 3 people
Did the variant where we tossed all the cards together

Out of two games - two unexpected wins and game turned out to be quicker than it seems at first

Love it for what it is

Can't wait to play 4 and then 5 with the expansion

--------------------

Played with four and went well - everyone had fun and game was quick - was slightly annoyed with all the counter spells and there is a variant or idea to remove some but I need more plays to see if I should or not

Next up - expansion with 5 people and those cards all tossed in

Excellent beer and pretzels game that with great replay value.  It's almost entirely tactical and while there is a good bit of luck (based on what spells you draw) there is quite a bit of room for skill and games generally go quickly enough that a run of bad luck isn't a big deal.  Best of all, it rewards clever play and the use of spell combos that can create some really entertaining situations.

This game is kind of fun, the elimination kills it a bit for me because you can get eliminated early and the game can go on for a while when it's down to two.  Having the game system completely based off of card draws is prone to luck swings also.  Overall though, the gameplay is pretty fun and I'd be up for it on occasion.  I think I just prefer Arcadia Quest much much more.

Many people complain about the Fantasy Flight design crew tinkering with the rules of the classic games they reprint, but personally I think they've done a fine job so far with Arkham Horror, Fury of Dracula, Talisman, Cosmic Encounter and now, Wiz-War. I see the logic in almost all of the changes that have been made to these games and for the most part, I agree with them.

From what I have heard, the older versions of Wiz-War had a tendency to lock up when certain combinations of permanent spells popped up or when someone got an over-powered healing engine set up. The redesign has eliminated these issues and from what I've heard it's for the better.

The game itself is sort of like a combination of Magic the Gathering and Dungeon Twister, with players sharing a common spell deck. This makes the game more luck dependent than others in the genre, because there is always the possibility that one player will draw more powerful or better situational cards than the other players. This effect is magnified when players are first getting familiar with the decks and many times the whole thing will end very suddenly with a flurry of big damage spells or else will devolve into a race game, with the wizards doing more running around than fighting.

Once players get more comfortable with the game, this becomes less common. Learning what cards are in the various decks can make defensive positioning a little easier, while figuring out how to play more creatively can often turn bad hands into winners.

Wiz-war is never going to win any awards for its strategic depth, but for a fairly light direct confrontation game it does a lot of things right. If the game is successful enough for Fantasy Flight to support it as much as they have Cosmic Encounter or Talisman, the fun factor will only go up.

Now go buy it, I want more classic cards for my set!

Well, this was a mistake. It's fine for what it is, I guess, but it's very dated. Yet for a simple, mostly dumb game, the rules are long and clunky. And it has all the usual multiplayer problems (let's you and him fight).

A spell-slinging battle-royale in a twisting labyrinth. That's exactly what you get in a game of Wiz-War...and it's fabulous!

Imagine a bunch of wizards got together and decided to have a magical duel consisting of equal parts death-match and capture-the-flag. Each player take their wizard and draws a handful of spell cards and then proceeds to sow havoc across the board! Kill another wizard? Get a point! Steal another wizard's treasure and get it to your base? Get a point! First player to 2 points wins.

But what really makes Wiz-War such a remarkable experience to me is that many of the spells you cast will make permanent alterations to the board! You might summon a huge stone that completely blocks a passageway. You might smash through a wall, leaving a gaping hole behind you. You might plant magical traps throughout the board that explode when stepped on, or summon a prickly rose bush that slows and harms anyone who tries to pass through it.

And that's just the beginning. You can turn into mist and slide under locked doors, or turn into a werewolf, or a brutish ogre. You can cloud the board in fog or create a wall of fire, or even steal your opponents spells right out of their brains!

Wiz-War is the epitome of every awesome wizard's duel you've ever imagined and it lets you pull some really crafty, devious tricks if you want to...or you can just throw fireballs at your enemies and smash them with huge rocks. It's very easy to pick-up and doesn't take much time at all to play but every minute will be filled with cheers and jeers, thrills and spills until one wizard reigns supreme.

It's not a serious game by even the slightest degree and it's full of hilarious chaos. And if any of such things disgust or offend you, well then I really do feel sorry that you're not getting every bit of raw, unapologetic fun that Wiz-War has to offer you. Because it is just about the most splendid, smile-producing sort of thing I could ever imagine wanting to be a part of.

Dueling mages on a grid movement modular board driven by card decks of spells in a free-for-all last Mage standing chaos fest. Lots of portal points make access to all parts of the map accessible. Simple rules but lots of FAQ contingencies. Silly fun with zany one up, spite and revenge. No mercy, some situations can shut you down. I like the new rules. I like that that a bad draw can be discarded for spell energy value. I like that permanents you maintain count towards your hand size. I don't mind the crazy but the downtime can be long between player turns. Still fun but I prefer Mage war even though that's a two player game.

I like it, but it's VERY chaotic. There's quite a few of rules issues, since the gameplay can be very versatile and a lot depends on players' imagination. It can be a hit-or-miss: some games would be very interesting, some would drag on.
There's a lot of focus on the theme, as it's a typical ameritrash. I prefer more strict and clear rules, but I do play the game from time to time, if just to have some magical fun. :P

I've had several plays of this game, and the most notable experience amongst all of those is the sheer variety that the game includes if you have a open and creative mind. I've played the standard "by the books" game with all amounts of players from 2-4. I've also played with various different "mods."

I've done a card drafting variant where each player picks two schools of magic then each card is drafted MtG style. 

I've done a deathmatch with items pre-spawned on the game board.

I am planning on creating a 2 player co-op game variant with the creatures and extra wizards that come out in waves.

The game is ultimately the best sandbox I've ever experienced in board game playing. No euro I've played allows for this type of variation. No other Ameritrash game could do such a thing either. Fantasy Flight did a fantastic job of breathing new life into an old classic, it's up to the player to turn it into something that works for them.

Old school randomness that has no business being reprinted.

It could be fun in a casual environment, but even then the player elimination can lead to some players sitting around waiting for the others to finish. It is pretty much the opposite of what I look for and enjoy in gaming.

We took a while to warm up to this. First few games were okay-ish, but it felt like the brakes were on. Too much racing for treasures, not enough proper wizard-warring. 

Slowly we reverted to the classic rules in the back of the rulebook. Permanent Creations. Deadly Treasures. Uncluttered Minds (for items). Then we tweaked the game with house rules to limit speed boosts. Took out some of the counterspells. 

With each step back in time, the game improved. It was like we were loosening the FFG straitjacket, allowing the classic game's full mad mayhem to burst forth. Now, two or three years after purchasing it, this has become one of our favourite games when we have four or more players around.

If you try the eighth edition and find it 'meh', don't give up. Tweak something and try again. Wiz-War bends easily, but doesn't break.

This game feels too dependent on the attitudes of the players against each other and then a mad dash at the end for me to enjoy it as-is. You need 2 points, and you get points for killing opponents. Ok. You can steal treasures for points as well. Ok.

Here's the problem. Everyone can gang up on a single player, effectively ensuring their failure. Then if anyone gets a treasure, they must immediately be reset to 0 points or they can sneak attack a wounded opponent or suddenly teleport that last treasure home for the win.

I can see ways to get around the rule follies, but as written I'm not a fan of the game.

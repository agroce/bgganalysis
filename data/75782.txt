This game is an interesting one.  Fast turns, until battle.  Which becomes an issue, lots of little rule questions we had to answer ourselves.

Fun, but wanting more clarifications etc.

This was a must buy till I read the rule book which seemed full of holes and not well thought out. Maybe this has been fixed to some extent, I'm not sure-- would give this a play to see how it is.

RATING: 6.5
Rated after 1 play. I would play again to see how I can get more out of it, for the moment it will stay 6.5 because of the extreme imbalance on the map. The expansion may solve this

RATING: 7
Very evocative of the Elite computer games, with simple pick-up and deliver gameplay, and a not-so-simple combat mechanism. ;-) The only real nitpick is that too many of the various event cards serve only to stall the game without any other effect... :-/

RATING: 8.5
Very good game based on Elite (the computer game), and feels like it also. Nice product (even if the box is too small) with great potential for an expansion. The pirate ships are mostly tough, but there is a nice balance between trading and combat and their relative risks.

Nach Einlesen in diverse Foreneinträge etc. scheint das Grundspiel an etlichen "Kinderkrankheiten" zu leiden. Dies kommt bei Kleinauflagen leider vor - und muss man wohl in Kauf nehmen.

Glücklicherweise kann man über die Foren/Downloads alle Fehler beheben und sich an dem Spiel erfreuen.

Wer sein "Grundspiel" auf den letzten (besser spielbaren) Stand bringen möchte sei die Expansion empfohlen.

I can't pinpoint what I didn't like. Obviously it needed a bit more mainstreaming, rules trimming and less micromanagement. However, as it is inspired by the Elite PC game, less micromanagement could ruin the point of the game. I did like the innovative battle system. I liked every aspect of the game at least a bit, but there was no main aspect that I enjoyed greatly.

This game had sooooo many issues.  The combat is pointless, and there are no interesting decisions to be made.  Just a bad bad game.  This should have been an amazing game based on the components and the theme, but instead we are left with a game that has zero fun in it.

Very good game. I would suggest to play it always with the variant, which allows you to select cards for a battle from the battledeck and not randomly draw cards from the batteldeck.

This is a really fun storytelling almost rpg-ish type of game. Feels a lot like merchants and marauders in space. The combat system can be a little drawn out but it is unlike any other combat system I've seen in a game. I really liked The Phantom League! More expansions!!!

RATING: 7
Fairly impressed with this as a 'star trader' type game, once I got past the intimidatingly long rulebook.  While it comes with heavy dose of randomness it's mostly not too heavy handed - with more experience you could probably judge the risk reward better and fans of Elite will love the HT in the random events linked to docking and travelling into unexplored territory - and it compares well with my meory of 'Merchants of Venus' as a trading game.  With three players, turns came around fairly quickly  we finished in around an hour and a half; though we assidiously avoided conflict (which I suspect would extend the time somewhat as it accounts for half the rulebook) being quite happy to explore, fulfil our missions and exploit the trade routes.  Praise is also due to the publishers for the massive amount of stuff crammed into the box - a very impressive opposite of 'empty box syndome'.

Direkter Konkurrent ist Merchant & Marauders.

Hauptunterschiede der Spielmechaniken:

5 Personen Spiel mit 3.5.0. -> 8 Punkte! Toll! :)
6 Personen Spiel mit 4.0.3. -> 1 Miner, 1 Kämpfer (NPC), 1 Erkunder, 3 Händler. Sehr ausgeglichenes Spiel, endete bei 8(Händler)-7(Erkunder)-7(Miner)-7(Kämpfer)-6(Händler)-5(Händler).  Hin und wieder ein paar längen zwischen den Spielzügen, ansonsten aber super zu 6.!

I had such high hopes for this sucker when the rules explanation began - variable player powers, with drafting!  A fun sci-fi theme, and even a little space exploration to boot.  Then the game started.  It was ho-hum at best.  Take a thing from here and drive it back to there.  Repeat until you make enough to pay to level up or buy some goodies.  Meanwhile, there is a system that randomly rewards some and ass-rapes others, which is fine in a game like Tales of the Arabian Nights that never claims to give players control of their destinies but is just stupid here.  That upgrade system you spent a ton of money on at the start?  Gone for no reason.  And on top of all of this there is a combat system that frankly does not work as written in the rules.  A ship with strong weapons is vastly outgunned by a ship that ignored that but happened to get symbols that gives it more cards.  Forget about escaping - just not enough cards to make it happen.  And this is if you can attack at all, which doesn't appear possible on docked ships (they can be merely blockaded).  Huge UGH.

RATING: 6
I love space games and this game probably deserves an 8 really but I need another play for that.

There's much to like here, captains and ships with different powers, missions to spice things up, event cards, player vs player combat and much more. What I don't like is that you never seem to have time nor money to build up your ship really. Sure you get some upgrades but I wish there would be more of the improve your ship aspect in the game.

Another thing that is a bit problematic is the hunt the leader that happens late in the game. Sure, it can be fun but also very frustrating. Another game will tell.

Update: After the second play you really notice all the rough edges of the game. The idea is cool but it doesn't really work out. Need (yet another) rules rewrite and perhaps an expansion to fix the most blatant problems.

Update 2: Now with expansion. The more you play it the more broken you notice it is. Rating down to 6 (which is too kind really, but I do want to like it).

RATING: 9
Finally a good space game!!  I avoided this game for years because I believed it was just another large hex honeycomb looking 4x space game.  It is not!!  This is an adventure game, a true space opera!!  Thank the gods!!  I could not handle another 4x honeycomb game.  4x is not space opera, it is civ with spaceships.  

If you want to be in a Firefly, Han Solo, Stars My Destination type world, look no further.  I just played Eclipse for the first time, and while an exceptional "design" it is just an echo of previous Twilight Imperium ideas.  Phantom League was a refreshing joy for me.

Like Zanzair, the combat is unfortunately kind of horrible.  So far I haven't played a game where card combat has worked.  FFG has been cranking out games recently that use card combat, and each one has diminished the overall experience for my game groups.  I can understand the appeal of hoping it will be cool design-wise but so far card combat adventure games are like playing a gorgeous game of Runebound and then having to play an overly complicated game of MtG for 5 minutes. Oil and water beverage really.

I will house rule combat if player are avoiding the game due to combat.  This game is a gem, and should not sit on a shelf if the combat gets in the way!!!

RATING: 6
Having played Merchant of Venus and having conflicting views on it, i now look back on this more favorably. Phantom League isn't necessarily better than MoV but they are in the same league.

Pretty solid adventure game. Certainly has more going on than Talisman, and shorter and simpler than some newer adventure titles.

The end game is basically king of the hill though. Who evers ahead gets sniped at, and if he falls 2nd place wins by virtue of being 2nd. Combat is very random, even with the rules modifications, due to the card deck, and probably more effort than its worth.

Good game overall however. Im not sure how it compares with Fleet captains as i havent played the latter.

I happened to enter to the local gaming event while there was one group of 5 players just starting this game, so I was driven to take part on it. Soonly came out that rules were very confusing and full of holes. "This is the most horrible rule book I've ever seen", said somebody.
Game components were confusing as well. Why the hell there's four decks of cards for different purposes and still all the backsides of cards are identical? 
Our group ended up to quit even before we finished the first round, we were so pissed off! 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fits into a category of games which have a lot of extraneous things going on, but not enough for the player to actually do.  Other games that I would put in that category would be Cosmic Encounter and Bushido.  The game requires a group to create the atmosphere themselves, because the negotiation system is undeveloped, and certain parts seem to have no purpose in game (good v evil, blockading), not even flavor.  To be fair, it is very hard to make a game of this type be compelling in such a short play time.   

Would prefer to play Star Trader, even at at least three times the length.  The concepts in this game (interstellar space travel and combat, supply/demand economics, good and evil) simply require more space and time.

This game is [b]SO CLOSE[/b] to what I wanted it to be.  I appreciate that the combat resolution is intended to "tell the story" of each skirmish, but it take far, far too long to slog through.  I don't want combat to be just a roll of the dice either, but there needs to be a happy medium.  I like the different paths to victory, allowing for the variety of characters and ship types.  The Pilot Academy expansion adds a lot of cool stuff, but the combat -- although even more cinematic and clever -- was slowed even more!

Unfortunatley, the game is now dismissed by several friends.  I need to make some serious changes and have good player aids at the ready if this is going to be played again with others.  And I want to!

This game needs new rules that clarify aspects of battle.  As it is, it is fun if you treat it as an experience game, perhaps a Space Merchants of the Arabian Nights.  It should be something I like, but it makes you think you have more control that Arabian Nights does.  Direct conflict, but with highly uncertain results, even with a fighter against an undefended garbage scow.

Some promising stuff, especially in the graphic design and theme department. 
However, the game is about random screwage. You draw dock cards, many of which say lose a turn. You draw hyperspace cards, many of which say lose a turn. You get points from mission cards, which may or may not accord with your ship type ("Hey, my destroyer can get points from shipping goods it can't carry! Nice!"). You get points from battles, which are very random.
The battles, in particular, are badly implemented. You spend a lot of time shuffling the battle decks and the results are very swingy. Support cards can often hose you via their "benefit." The system also encourages player elimination. 
I could go on, but you get the point.

Thematically very strong game with well working graphics. I think that battle system doesn't fit to the game because it is too complicated and slows down the game.

Rating could rise with more plays.

RE THEME: So, the 2nd version of Phantom League will be called "Singularity Sky" and we will adapt the flavor texts to fit that universe. The schedule has been adjusted accordingly. We can't possibly make a new version in spring 2015 as planned before, but the aim is to make everything ready by late autumn 2015.

Similar to newer Merchants and Marauders. I would have to look into it more before buying. Combat system is a bit complicated.

Nice game with strong theme. Science fiction is usually not my thing. I liked the game, it had a lot of things to do. Your chosen character and the features of your ship strongly guide your gameplay.

RATING: 8
Delivers exactly what I want out of it -  a thematic adventure in space. Has it all: exploration, trading, combat and lots of encounters. Components could be better.

Update: After yet another great session, I'm almost upgrading the rating to 9. The only reason I won't is that the rulebook could be better, and I'd like it to be better with 5 and 6 players. As it is, there is too much downtime for larger groups.

NOTE: I bought both of the expansions with the base game, and have only played with the consolidated rulebook and revised combat system.

My first game of this was way too long. Six players, four hours, rules explanation included, and we didn´t even quite finish. The downtime was quite painful when I knew what I wanted to do several turns ahead: "I want to go there, sell five slaves for 425, buy one fuel and buy reputation. Then I´ll go over there, fight the pirates and trade fuel for ore.". But no, there was a strike and no trading at the first place, so I had to sit around and wait for a full turn. By the time it was my turn again, I had almost lost focus. I´m reluctant to give this another try, but I guess I should, with fewer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I want to love this game. Concept and theme are a full 10 for me. But the current edition has far too many problems. It's a playtest version that's been pushes to production to make it in time for Spiel 2010, and that has caused a lot of problems: the components don't fit in the box, the rulebook is incomplete and already obsolete. The rules that were explained during the demo game are nowhere to be found in the rulebook. And I think the combat system still needs some work.

I'll adjust my vote when I get my hands on a fixed version of this game.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]21-Jan-2014[/u]: This one first caught my eye on the SGoYT lists.  I've only played it twice at the time of this writing and only solitaire, but I really like it.  The theme is very Firefly-like.  You must explore the galaxy, transport goods and other cargo, fight off space pirates, and deal with various government officials.

You may choose the path of Fame or Notoriety.  Good guy or bad...it's your call.  Each will offer different sets of challenges and different missions to complete.  Lots of replayability with random hex map setup, multiple choices for spacecraft and captain, and several different missions.  The game is completely card based, including combat (which is a little wonky at first but not too difficult to figure out after a couple of rounds).

Lots of theme in this game.  Components are very nice as well.  Add in the first expansion for even more variety in all aspects of the game.  Definitely worth it.

RATING: 3
There's nothing here that Merchants & Marauders doesn't do better. The theme will be a draw for some folks, though not with me. 

The game's description says "Card-driven game play – you, not the dice, are in control of the game". I'd amend that to say "The cards - not the dice - are in control of the game. Between the mission cards, the event cards for the docks and hyperspace and the cards in combat, there can be extremely large swings in fortune based on which card you drew. Late in the game, I went to the Central planet and drew a dock card: You can't dock this turn. Fine. Docked next turn, drew a dock card: The market is closed today, no trading. Sweet. I essentially missed 2 turns because I drew bad cards. 

Also, 2 of my 3 mission cards gave me a VP for killing a pirate (draw 2 and discard the weaker one) and I was flying the Cargo Cube ship, created for defense and storage. I wasn't going to kill any pirates. I realize that you can ally in this game, but when I'm in the lead and near winning, who would ally with me to do the heavy lifting in combat? Oh, and I got to be in the lead for discovering new planets and getting lucky by drawing a card that gave me an "alien card". This card gave me 2vp (*poof!*) of the 8vp needed for victory. It also said that I could not use attack cards. Now, if you can prove that your missions cannot be completed you can exchange them for new ones. Since I can't use attack cards, does that mean that my pirate-killing missions can't be completed? I can still ally with another player and kill them that way (but when I have 7vp no one would do that). The rules were a little messy in places.

Also, the verbiage on the board pissed me off a bit; a planet says "Sells Fuel for 15, Buys Ore for 10, Trades 2 Food for 1 Narcotics." I read that as "I can trade 1 Narcotics for 2 Food". Apparently it works the opposite way, which I found after spending 3 turns setting up a trade that I couldn't do.

So I'll say that, while the game is an outright failure for me, I don't think it's terrible. It's an experience game and it's a science fiction game, so right there I'm out. It also lacks polish and has some rough spots. As soon as Carl brought it out, I wanted to play a flicking game with the ship discs. He should have let me.

RATING: 5
When I played it, this was rough around the edges. The combat resolution decks are strangely unbalanced, and have way too many cards in them. The exploration mechanic works well. Trading between systems works decently, too, but becomes dry once it's reduced to maximizing the amount of credits you can earn per turn. Having only one of each weapon or outfit is a strange limitation. All told, this game doesn't quite mesh.

The game looks lovely, the theme is great and the quality of the components is very high.

Most of the game works; the trading, the movement, the exploration - but combat weakens the game to the point of virtually breaking it.  Combat is unintuitive and time-consuming; none of our group enjoyed the combat system and we're pondering how one might go about fixing it while retaining the other elements of the game.

Update: Traded away.
The poor rulebook and various errors made it seem like a pre-production prototype than an actual finished, ready to sell game.  Got rid of it and haven't missed it.  Ultimately very disappointing.

Board game inspired by Elite. Fun to play and has several strategies for victory. Reasonable playtime for a space exploration game. If you do not want to command your galactic empire, but just want to cruise around the galaxy as a lone bounty hunter, pirate, smuggler or merchant, this is the game to get.

The rating is with the combat dice mechanism only that can be found on BGG. The battle cards are broke. I really like the game itself though, very fun space exploration game.

Note: This is based on one game only, and with a pre-release version.

Board: The board is made up of three circles of systems, with pre-determined cetral system, a ring of known systems and an un-explored third ring. Each system has two points of interest, but the way they are constructed has an additional twist to increase permutation chances a lot. You'll just have to see. Graphically they are pleasing to the eye, though the blue background chosen does not evoke feeling of deep space in me.

Pieces: There are counters for trade goods, ship sheets for each player, numerous cards in several decks, and of course the ships. In most of the cases the relevant information was on the cards, mostly symbolic but easy to remember and distinct.

Gameplay: 

The objective is to gather reputation. The number required is standard, and oppponent reputation can be reduced by making them flee a combat - though more on that, below. It is gained through spending money, performing missions, detroying enemy spaceships, exploring the third ring systems and some random events. The cost of buying reputation is increasing and cannot bridge the last gap - even the previous ones are prohibitively expensive; the exploration gains stop two steps away from winning, or when the whole map is explored. 

Your progress is hampered by events, the most common being one targetting illegal trade goods or causing your turn to end without being able to do what you wanted.

In the game I played the victorious player gained most points through exploration, missions for the last point while the second (that was one action away from victory) used a combination of money, exploration, random victory points and missions. 

Trading: The planets and space stations can sell, buy and trade various products (fuel, which is used to fly around and to trade with; 2 legal trade goods and 2 illegal kinds), with some systems only selling or buying, while others had a mix. Trading can net you quite a bit of money, resulting in ship with improvements and some reputation gains. The prices do not fluctuate, so a trader would most likely be jumping the same trade route (2-3 stops) through much of the game - and potentially the most lucrative trade route could be located within one star system. Trading also gest slightly more hazardous with increased reputation. This combined with the price of reputation increase going steeply up makes the greediest capitalist having to venture out eventually.

Exploration is a quick way to points, though somewhat hazardous. The game had only one player exploring systems, which I imagine will change with a bit more experience: letting one player explore most won't happen as people will start their own explorations sooner. 

Fighting: This is perhaps the weakest part of the game: normally quick flow of turns is interrupted, the combat takes time. I did not see it as having many tactically interesting decisions and in general it seems underpowered. There were exactly five combats in the game I participated in: twice a player attacked another, and both combats resulted in minor damage only, thrice a player picked a fight with a pirate: two easy kills and one inconclusive encounter technically labeled player victory. 

This however I believe is just a matter of balancing and a bit of errata or houserules: the basic comcepts of the battle are grounds for a good combat mini-game. 

The missions, trading and exploration seem good and mostly balanced. Missions can conceivably be your only source of points - the trading and exploration can not take you to victory, but be good steps on the way towards it.

There is an author intent of having alternative for missions that springs from combat, picking fights with pirates and such. I don't know if it works right now. Nobody in the game I participated in really attempted it. 

The author listed suitability for players is 2-6. However, the number of unexplored systems and that of trade goods does not change with player numbers (now), the higher and lower limits of this number affect gameplay strength of trading and exploring significantly. 

Overall: Interesting game with multiple victory paths that seem balanced: Good looking, generally fast to play. At the stage I played it I'd put it at 8, but bear in mind I have a grand total of one game played. That's why I don't rate it officially.

Really nice game, lots of interesting tactics and a great 'elite' or 'X' board game. Loses a few marks as the rules are a little clunky (especially combat), and the two player game leaves a little to be desired. 

Otherwise, a great game.

(I only ever played this with the Mostly Harmless expansion included.)

There's a lot to like about this if you are looking for a space adventure game. Most of the production values are extremely good - I like the art, the graphic design, the thickness of tiles and the discs used for player pieces. 

The game's biggets flaws are a result of loosness of design: so if you are only interested in complete, rigorously-playtested, fat-trimmed games you should avoid this like the plague. 

To me, it feels more like a GM-less space RPG, including the need to fudge rules, make up interpretations on the spot, and to be more interested in the experience than winning. Drawing tons of cards every turn grew tiresome, altho I did like the general balance of what was on the cards, and think it reflected the source material (ie Elite computer game) well. 

The combat system is at first a little bizarre, but I am a fan of card-based systems eg the various ones in FFG games (Rune Wars, Star Craft). This is a worthy and novel addition to those, but not quite as tight, far less of a draw (more something that just works out as OK). 

A revised 2nd edition in about 5 years time could be really interesting. If you are looking for a game that is somewhere between Merchants of Venus, Eclipse, and Arkham Horror, this might be the game for you, especially if you are not afraid of making your own adjustments to get the game working better.

This phantomatic game should disappear in the outer space. Ok, I'm just joking, anyway this game needs bugs fixing. The combat system is something of delirious. Nice modular ideas around, but lot of problems (i.e. goods icon soooo small). Failed.

It is a good game overall but for me the combat seemed really messy and the cards (for hyperspace and docking) made the game a bit too random for some strategies. Rating might raise with more plays.

The original rulebook is useless. Print the newest one or you'll end up burning the game.

Great theme, but the cards make it about luck. With two players first you just explore and then it's luck which one of you gets better cards to win the game faster. Meh.

Could be better with more people and negotiations?

A space trading/combat game, clearly modelled on Elite. The movement and trading aspects are great. The combat is horribly broken, and essentially ruins the game. It takes way too long to resolve combat which leaves the uninvolved players sat around doing nothing. And the combat itself is both confusing and unbalanced. It feels like a game that's been rushed to market without play testing.

The Phantom League is essentially unplayable with the the rulebook as-shipped, and the box is half the size needed to hold the beautiful components.  Is there a baked game in this?  Not sure yet, must play again.  At first blush, the missions look uneven and the docking cards a luckfest.  Battles look like a real chore. We'll see...

I had high hopes for this game, as I thought it would be Merchants & Marauders gone space. However, for me this game seems like ore, it's still in a raw state. There's a lot of potential, but it still takes an awful lot of work to get there. 

First of all,I think there needs to be "non-starting-player"-recompensation. 

Turn 1: Player 1 buys 10 ore for 50
Turn 1: Player 2 buys 5 ore for 25(as he is only allowed for up to 5 ore)
Turn 1: Player 3 can merely buy 2 ore max. for 10
Player 4, 5,6 

Turn 2: Player 1 sells 10 ore for 25 (or 30 - I forgot) on a closeby planet each: 250 or 300
Turn 2: Player 2.... 5 ore 125 or 150
Turn 2: Player 3...2 ore 50 or 60 

C'mon - why is the starting world called central if you can only buy ore there? With the right planet(s) on the already revealed rim, that's a killer advantage there for tge guys going first. 

Next, I really hate how you do not know where which planets are. This is avery crucial part in a pick-up and deliver-game. Which this one mostly is. In Merchants & Marauders it is revealed information which trade good is in demand where. 
Plus, it sucks even more regarding the missions.It's very likely you don't know where the planets for your mission are, unless once again you get lucky early on. Or you hope that the planets will appear in the direction you are moving to. And even swapping missions doesn't help here, since you can only swap one card and the problems remain the same. Get lucky or die trying. Massive, really massive swings of luck here. In our play for example. Player 1 found a world where he could buy narcotics for 5 apiece. The last player revealed a planet where one could sell narcotics for 80(!) apiece right next to that planet. Again, player 1 had the advantage of being able to buy more narcotics then everyone else and on the next turn get rich. Which leads me to the question why resources are limited. Is the galaxy that short on minerals or food that you can just so fill 5 spaceships with it? 

Now investing in slaves or narcotics early on in the game is highly risky,because the penalty is superharsh, but I'll come to that soon. (And it's not so risky,if you already made a profit of 200 for your ore sales in the first two rounds)

Slaves and narcotics are quite profitable since you can buy them for 5 to 15 and resell them for up to 80, which is quite a higher margin in comparison to the max. 30 for ore, fuel or food, but it is something the planetary governments are not keen to see happen on their planets. So when docking there is a chance you draw really bad cards, that not only seize all the goods but on top make you pay a fine. If you cannot pay the fine, we're not finished here, no. You have to negotiate with someone who will pay the rest for you or to give you some more so the recovery phase won't be that brutal. Of course this will lead you to some confessions on your part you'd rather not have made. Now in our game it took me about four turns to recover (early on in the game), buying a little here, selling next turn there. Then buying some little more there and on the fourth turn selling the little more there.

So I lost four turns basically, plus

- one turn in which I picked up the slaves
- one turn in which I tried to dock and sell them
- the fuel I lost on the way

So my lesson from this is: NEVER EVER TAKE A RISK EARLY IN THE GAME (and try to know what therisks are exactly. I thought I was quite well prepared)! Buy some normal stuff and resell it. Start it easy and then later on go for the  risky moves. If at all. 

Next part: the battles. As I get tired, here it is in short. Over-complex and totally uninteresting. In my session it was. There was not a single exciting fight. The pirates were blasted out of space before they even had a chance to counterattack, even if players did not team up. And how can you advertise or claim that it is you who decides not the dice and by that suggesting this game is strategical, if for real, it's the cards (docking), once more the cards (hyperspace), yet another time the cards (battle) and the random set-up of the board that makes the decisions?
Now I won't complain about games taking mechanisms from different games. Re-hashes are quite common and surely okay. But what good is the "two cards from the destination deck"-mechanic thematically for? In BSG it is highly involved within the game and keeps the suspense and the thrill up. Here it adds even more randomness. Mechanically I guess I know wwhat the designer was trying to achieve, which is making PvP not completely planable. But the pirates are already a game of chances. You never know whether you encounter a tough or a tiny pirate vessel. 

Also, this game should be called the Downtime league. Playing with 6 in my first game surely didn't help, but I didn't expect that I should have brought something to read for inbetween turns. 

Finally, this game did not initiate what I had hoped for. The movie in the head. Wild swings of luck combined with a  rather tenacious exercise in pushing tokens around the board does not compute with me. But what really kills this game for me, is the tremendous amount of hidden information, that makes it a luck-fest of the worst kind. Now back to the carribean. 

ps: Rules 4.0.3

If you like Elite the video game, this game easily gets a rating of 9. But if you are not fun of Elite type of game then you may want to see the BGG video review here and decide. I don't like this type of games and the combat system simply added enough complexity to offset the things I liked in the game. If you like role playing games, give this one a try! It is a good game.

The game has some very nice ideas - trading commodities, customizing your ship, and a richly detailed background. The building and fiddling make me come back to this game regularly.

Alas: There are also some rather serious problems - everything is wildly unbalanced, combat is extremely lethal and random (and time consuming), and some play strategies are strongly superior to others (which is a problem, since the Captains and ships are geared to different strategies, some of which just aren't competitive). 

The basic rules also assume player elimination. In a game which can take hours, and where you can get eliminated in the first 30 (or 5) minutes, that doesn't really work for me.

It's basically a roleplaying game, on a board, with an evil and sadistic GM.

After one play, this is a near-miss game for me.  I really liked a lot of the stuff in this game.  The 1/2 hexes board layout was cool, but the theme and combat resolution and...luck factor seemed a bit off...and we played with Mostly Harmless & Pilot Academy expansions.  I'd definitely play it again, but I was much more excited about this game before my first play than after it.

"Elite" cardboard style.  Expect "take that" conflict, negotiations, and possible player elimination.  Combat system is somewhat arbitrary but improved with the Pilot Academy expansion.  Buy low, sell high, improve your status to 8 for the win.  Fight pirates and other players along the way.  More of an adventure than a strategy game but thematic and even better if you played and liked "Elite" growing up.

Love it - lots of room to grow into this one. Disappointed that the expansion is so hard to get if you didn't preorder and seems necessary to fill the game out i.e. going to the Dark Side offers very little in the way of benefits in the base game so not really worth it and that is a shame. I wanted to trade in drugs and slaves in my first game and quickly found that it was a mistake and cost me the game. Just to difficult and others will pass you by as you try to make that big dangerous score. The chances of success are just to low. BUT - worth investigating more I suppose - attacking as much as possible and trading in slaves and drugs sporatically when your odds are the greatest. The Dark Side just calls... :-)

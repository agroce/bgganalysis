Ein ziemlich willenloses Kartenglückspiel. Man spielt im Grunde nicht wirklich gegeneiander da jeder sein eigenes Spielbrett hat. Eine Mischung aus Carcassonne und Wickinger und absolut wilenlos, wie schon erwähnt. Kauft es lieber nicht, es sei denn, ihr wollt ein einfaches Legespiel mit Zufallscharakter.

I think it has to be the topic to earn such a high rating.  It's basically up to 4 player solitare with absolutely no interaction between players.  Yet, my wife and I are still drawn to it.

RATING: 7
For puzzle fans and light gamers, a real win.  There is virtually no interactions, but it isn't really needed.  Game play is fast and that makes playing multiple times in a row easy.  This is a good thing for a gateway game as players will get 1 game in to understand and a second game in with more 'strategy'.  Glad I have this one.

I bought this game because it was very very cheap, so I told myself: "why not? I could always reuse the components if it's really bad...".

It turns out it is a true solitaire game: there' absolutely no interaction between players! It is very simple and luck driven: turn a card and place a tile on the spot indicated by the card. It's a sort of Bingo meets Carcassonne...

Having said that, I must admit it's an unusual 10 minutes solitaire I can see myself enjoy in the right circumstances...

RATING: 6.5
A pleasant enough light end of evening filler, however another game where the fall of the tiles and the turn of the cards can fall in your lap or slap you in the face. From that point of view the experience can be quite infuriating. I think there is more luck than skill, no player interaction so can easily be player solo.

Not a game I'd ever buy.

Don Quixote is a great tile laying game. Yes, it is multiplayer solitaire, but so what? You are still competing against your opponent to place your tiles in the most efficient manner possible to score the most points. I see myself soloing this many, many times joining Factory Fun and For Sale as multiplayer games with awesome solo modes.

Multi-player solitaire. I prefer games that let me do nasty things to my opponents, but I still find this very fun. Might be because it has some similarities to Carc, and is VERY reminiscent of Take It easy, both of which are favorite of mine.

RATING: 3.5
A multi-player (or true) solitaire game that is too heavily based on luck.  More work and frustration than fun.  It plays like the games Take It Easy and Take It to the Limit in reverse because the position on the board is selected (first) and then you must pick a tile to place on that section.  It has more complex goals than the two games that I mentioned, and somehow this complexity removes the fun from the game.  The frustrating thing is that there are not many 3- and 4-way intersections to help you connect roads... so you're always having to make sacrifices... and this slows the game down.

Almost identical to Cities. Except 3 scoring rounds and you dont place pawns. Very nice solitare. If you like carcasonne but want to play solo this is the game. Still good! very luck of draw, your planning goes out the window if you draw poorly.

Two castles are placed on a board. You draw a hand of tiles. A random place on the board is chosen. You must place one of your tiles there. Your goal is to connect windmills to windmills, churches to churches, and knights to castles (and the borders). I tried this solo on BSW.

How is this a game? Even after I became sort of familiar with the tiles, the element of chance was so strong that it was nearly impossible to plan. When my fifth game ended up scoring nearly the same as my first game, there's something wrong. I seriously think I could score just as well playing my tiles randomly.

In this game, each player selects their own tile to place, but everyone places in the same location of the grid on their player boards.  This game reminds me of Cities by Martyn F.  In that game, everyone places the same tile, but in different locations.  Super thin theme, but a good puzzley-style game if you're into those.  Some fun.

I don't really like puzzle games, but this solves the speed and competitive elements by removing them altogether and making it purely solitaire.   It's like a mix of Bingo and Carcasonne with 2x1 tiles.  Roads don't have to be connected, but the scoring escalates when you do connect them.   It's quick and has enough randomness to keep it light - that helps its appeal in my book.  It also has the same kind of benign, mindless, "comfort" appeal of doing a crossword puzzle or word search, if that makes any sense. Unfortunate game name, however.  It doesn't fit.

This is an odd game. It's interesting more than fun and definitely made to be an app. I am surprised that people own it as a board game. You draw random tiles, to place in random spaces generated by the game, with roads that may or may not connect, to connect windmills, churches and cottages, and if knights are on those roads you score bonus points....(???) In real life you do this simultaneously and compare scores at the end. Weird! The very definition of multiplayer solitaire. My highest score is 69 which is not enough to unlock the Sancho Pansa Expansion Tile. I don't think that my opinion would change much if I had. A fast playing time waster on the tube journey to work, but forgettable.

This is a reasonably attractive tile-laying game, but I did not find it engaging in the least.  I felt the random draw of placement spaces made the game frustrating (though for some reason I do not feel that way about Finito, a game that is in some ways similar.)

RATING: 7
For what it is, a solitaire for multi-players, I liked it. Just like in Take It Easy or Cities (2 games I really enjoy) you all play your own set of tiles to your own board. A simple deck of cards selects the place the tiles will go for everyone each turn. The difference here is that you each draw the first 9 tiles, see them, and then choose which you play. Then score for sets joined by paths, then play the next 7, score, then the final 5+1 and score.

The game turns solely on the ability to build pathways that join. Since each player could be using a different part of the same tile set each phase, you cannot really compare my play with yours (as you can with TIE or Cities). But that did not detract from our enjoyment.

If you like this sort of thing, you'll like Don Quixote. I got mine cheap for 8 quid off German Amazon. Bargain!

Neat little game. Not very expensive and you can play it solo or against other players.

This game is ok as far as random tile laying goes.  It's more "push your luck" than strategy since you don't have your full set of tiles available on any given round and the placement is random as well.  I can't imagine a multiplayer version of this being fun in the slightest since there is zero player interaction.

That this has currently a 2.4 weight rating is the best joke I've seen on Boardgamegeek in a long time. I mean, seriously. Who are the other people who vote for this?

It's Carcassone, except more frustrating and with far, far less interaction. If I had half an hour per turn, I would both do much better at it, and find it even more boring than I do, which is already pretty boring. 

Do yourself a favor and play Carc with the first to expansions instead when this particular itch needs scratching. This game is about as tiresome as a game can get and still be competently designed without any major holes.

I had the honour to play the Prototype before the game was released. Similar mechanics like "Take it easy" with a touch of Carcassonne, everyone having his/her own board. Very easy, very quiet and a lot of luck, but very enjoyable. My wife luvs it.

This is more puzzle than game...

LIKE:

* Well, it is quick and harmless.  Don't think I need to play again though.

DISLIKE:

* Comparisons have been made to Take It Easy and I understand where people are coming from, but this "game" pales in comparison and everyone is playing different tiles in this game - this is literally multiplayer solitaire where there is absolutely no interaction in any way.  
* You do have limited control once you know the tiles, but most of the game score comes down to luck of the draw.  I'm just not certain if there is any more to explore after a couple plays.  There isn't enough meat there to interest me in trying to do better!

I enjoy Take It Easy.  I do not care for this one.

On the surface this looks like a rather dull game. And while it lacks certain excitement that action oriented games have, there is plenty of anguish at the challenge of placing your tiles right to score big. Luck may work against you but you need to plan your tile placements the best you can to minimize a bad card draw.

I simply love it. It is multiplayer solitaire but its trying to figure out this puzzle of points that is the really enjoyable part. It is quick to setup and play too, and after a game you want to go again to beat your score!

Much more than I expected it to be. But might not be for everyone.

Agreed this one is 'multiplayer-solitaire', but this doesn't mean it bad at all. If you don't like 'multiplayer-solitaire' then don't play it (same reason I usually avoid abstract games - which doesn't make them bad either...), but if you like games like e.g. then this is worth playing.

RATING: 9
Solo: This is an outstanding solitaire game, and one of my favorites. Alongside Ghost Stories, it's the only game I've ever played 10 times in a row during my first session. My scores ranged from the mid-30s to 63; a good game is 70 and a great one is 100, so I've got plenty more to figure out.

And it's a very enjoyable game to figure out, with a puzzle-like quality that I enjoy. You have to make lemonade out of lemons sometimes, and you can get hosed by the draw or especially the placement of the castles. But games are 15 minutes long (pretty consistently across my first 10 plays), so that doesn't bother me.

It's fun, engaging, and oddly relaxing -- though definitely a game, not a time-passing activity. There's lots to think about in each game, and plenty of interesting decisions to make, with a good amount of tactics and luck management and just a dash of strategy. If it were longer I probably wouldn't like it, but it's so quick, easy to learn, and difficult to master that I love it.

Worst. Game. Ever!
OK, I'll go into some more detail:
This is a pure solo game, but it's sold only in quantities of four. And I don't mean multiplayer solitaire, I really mean solo. You could play in different rooms or on different days and then compare results. What your fellow players do has no effect on your result at all - all you need is the same random order of location tiles. Boardgames bring people together? Not this one. 
And even in that said solo game, you may work out a plan, but it will depend largely on the luck of the draw towards the end of each round whether everything falls into place or not. 
The Sancho Pansa promo makes it at least bearable and should be integral part of the game - cutting this out from the base game is a big editorial fail.

A mildly charming, very light and very quick game, with barely a thread of connection theme-wise to Cervantes' beloved hero and novel. Plays much like a less elegant [i]Take It Easy[/I] but in reverse: instead of drawing a random tile and placing it anywhere on the board, you randomly draw a specific board location and cover it choosing from a small pool of tiles (nine in the first phase, then seven, then five).

Nearly spoiled by an enormous luck factor; my initial solitaire scores varied wildly: 30 (poor), 76 (very good), 36, 80, 27. Wouldn't it be more of a game if, in each phase of play, all players chose from identical sets of tiles? Not that hard to sort out and manage I would think. [7 plays, 5 solo; gave away]

Pleasant if unexceptional solitaire puzzle game that recalls titles such as Traxx, Take It Easy and Cities. I would rank this last among that bunch, but it's still a fun game to play from time to time that gives off a strong Carcassonne vibe. I'm not sure it's very balanced as a competitive game. I think you should approach the game with a mindset of competing with yourself and your own tile/card draw, even if others are also playing at the time.

A pretty random no-interaction puzzle type game of placing tiles onto your tableau to score points, available at BSW. Technically it's playable by 4, but that would be 4 concurrent solitaire affairs. Tiles are Carcassonne like, but Carc rules don't apply - anything can go anywhere. There are three rounds, and each round you draw a third of your tiles, place them turn by turn, then score. Each turn, each player will place in the same spot on their individual 3x8 tableau, but they may place any of the tiles in their set, thus generating score differences. Basically, you're trying to connect everything likeminded together via roads - windmills, churches, soldiers. If playing solitaire, your score is pretty much a random function of whether you're allowed to place next to castles early. Otherwise, there's score luck on what cards you've drawn and more score luck on whether it turns out you've played them in the right order or not. Which can only be assessed once the random spot generation has finished for the round. You'll either get lucky with the decisions you made on the order you've placed tiles, or not. The general aim is to get good connector cards into the central spots and hope you’re given the chance to place soldiers against the castles. But you’re just as likely to hold onto good tiles, waiting for good spots, and end up with them stuck in corners as the last spots. It's pretty random. At least the decisions you make on what to keep and when, which is in effect a continual odds calculation, perhaps boosted with knowledge of the cards you have left for remaining rounds, is engaging enough with some groan factor. But it's got that Take It Easy all-depends-on-the-last-spot feel, so don't get emotionally invested. It's all over in 15-20 minutes, so it’s decent semi-filler territory and interesting for a while.  (High score: 78).

Carcassone meets Bingo.  Light fun, plays quickly, solo option nice.  After several plays, this one has grown on me, so bumped up two points, as daughter Raye really loves it.  Gift to Sophie; Lena; Jonah R; Sanchi.  Copy traded.  Copy going to MRJ via BGG.

Puzzle game with three scoring rounds. Kind of like a solitare version of Bingo in that each player has the same pieces and the same board. Each player is just trying to place their pieces to earn optimal points, with no need to consider anything the other players are doing.

This is a very so-so multiplayer solitaire. The luck of the draw on the card location is just not good. You may end up with a lot of blocked roads going nowhere. Since you place one tile at a time, you can't put too much thinking on how to place your tiles. I will search or think of a variant that does not use the cards, which may salvage the nice pieces.

Carcassonne meets FITS.  It's alright, but zero player interaction is a bit of a bummer.  Scoring can be a little tricky to wrap your head around, but not too bad.  Square tiles (instead of rectangular) could have possibly made this more interesting.

I'm a big fan of Cities and rate that game a 9. I heard about this new game as being similar, so I purchased it and have played about 5 solo games so far. It's interesting, but I'm not sure if it's of the same caliber as Cities yet. I'm willing to give it a few more plays and may adjust my rating later.

Good for a gentle, puzzle-type, solo play. 

Build pieces on your board at locations dictated by grid-cards in order to achieve the best points combinations: connecting churches/windmills. border defences etc. Three scoring rounds. Try to beat your best score (solo) or opponents score.

Nice multi-player for gentle, non-confrontational gamer types.

I owned this for quite some time before I got around to playing it - I was slightly timid to give it a shot as people seem to often refer to it as "multi-player solitaire" or "a more complex variation of bingo" which didn't sound appealing to me at all. After playing it,  I was surprised to find it enjoyable. Sure, you are limited in options but there is a pleasant puzzle element as you try to maximize your piece's potential, both in their playability with other pieces as well as working towards one of the scoring methods. I suppose the descriptors were accurate as you had no interaction and had no control over the destination of a piece (though you chose which piece would go there). However, I think a more apt descriptor would be a "euro version of bingo" - it sounds like an odd combination but it somehow works.

Several plays on BSW, all but one were solo games (but even the 2er was no different -- this is multiplayer solo).

It's like Take It Easy, but backwards: everyone has the same set of tiles, but instead of calling out a tile and everyone playing it where they want, you call out a location and everyone plays a tile (one of a subset of the 24 tiles -- 9 in round 1, 7 in round 2, 5 in round 3; 3 unplayed) to that location.

Feels very very random, with your score depending greatly on the initial placement of the castles and the luck of the draw. When playing multiplayer, I think it would make more sense (as a multiplayer, competitive game) if everyone were working with the same subset of tiles each round. Otherwise, it's just a crapshoot.

Of course, I'm sure puzzle masters will do better than I have been doing (high score so far = 80, and very lucky; my average is 48.96). But it's just not a lot of fun -- after many many solo tries on BSW, I think I am probably essentially done with this.

Like Carcassonne crossed with Bingo -- tile placement and orientation are decisions which seem interesting and even agonizing, but whether or not those decisions prove to be good is almost entirely random. Only a quick filler, and still not worth the time.

An interesting tile-laying game with individual boards and a BINGO-like aspect to the way the tiles appear.  Used mostly for solo play as we have many other tile-laying games that would be chosen over this one.  But, I still think it is a pretty good game.

Neat little competitive solitaire puzzle, laying tiles to connect castles, knights, churches and windmills. Easy to explan. Sort of reverse Take it Easy (the space is called; the tile is your choice). Plenty of factors to account for.

Super _super_ light game of players all pulling tiles in an identical order and each trying to arrange the roads and paths to get the best score for connections to cities, knights, windmills etc.

I'm going to give this one another shot, but I suspect it'll be consigned to the dustbin of too light for me to want to play. Perhaps for kids?

There's zero player interaction here, but it does have a creative bingo meets carcassonne single player vibe going for it.

You score will absolutely improve as you memorize the available tiles and it has a very addictive quality.

Should work great for parents/grand parents too as it scratches that Solitaire itch.

Obviously the downside is that you are totally playing by yourself and comparing scores at the end.

This game is just...horrible. I like tile laying games because usually you end up wih some interesting choices...Don Quixote on the other hand manages to take tile laying and strip you of all decision making, instead replacing it with sheer luck as to who will win after "playing" for 30 mins.

Sort of the inverse of Cities - instead of having to play a given tile anywhere you want, you play the tile you want (from a limited selection) in a given location. 

My one game I found a bit more interesting than Cities, as the intermediate scoring adds something. I'm not sure that the last round ends up working that well, though, as it can be nearly optimized (you can pick the best space for each of the first 5 tiles, and at most 1 won't be able to go there).

Really enjoyable (multiplayer-) solitaire game.

There is quite a bit luck involved, but because of the different possibilities to score there is more influence then you think at first glance.

Fun game if you like to puzzle and don't need interaction in a game or like to play solo.

Yes, it's a combination of Carcassonne and Take It Easy!, but it also has some Ta Yu thrown in there for a different sort of flavor.  It's a clever little game, with some neat choices to make, but the randomness of the card draw, paired with the randomness of the tile draw, is a little frustrating.  It lacks some of the elegance of Cities, though the scoring is easier to understand, and I think it would play more quickly.  I've only played it solitaire so far, but I wouldn't mind trying it with more players.  I wonder if the variances of drawing the tiles between all players would prove to be another source of frustration, though.

The game will take 3 rounds. In the first round, each player turns 9 tiles face up in front of him. One player is turning the cards, and tells the location on it. Each player now pick one of his 9 face up tiles, and place the tile on the location which is just told. After placing 9 tiles, there is a scoring phase, and the second round starts. The only difference between the rounds, are the number of tiles that are placed face up in front of the player and the amount of points you might collect. As said, in the 1st round, it’s 9 tiles. In the 2nd round that are 7, and in the final round it’s 5+1. The 1 is placed a-side (face up), and has to be placed as the last tile.
When the final scoring is done, the player with the most points win.

This is a light, correction, very light game. It’s completely random. There is no interaction between players at all. I’m even in doubts to call this a game. It’s more of a puzzle, where the task is to control the randomness the best way you can. It plays in about 15 minutes. So at first glance it doesn’t sound interesting at all. And still. It’s fun. Maybe it’s the theme which make me think back to our Andalusian trip, and where I said M. looked like Don Quixote with her crutches. Anyway, it will be hard to tell who will like this game. If you want to play a little puzzle game every now and then, this might be a game for you. If you want a brain-burner, just skip it.

Quality paints for miniatures. One of the few things my art studio is missing entirely would be mini paint needs. I plan to build a lot of paints/washes/special effects and all sorts of things for dioramas--it's a massive list. I have lots of clay but can always use more sculpey. 

Playmats where appropriate. 

Metal coins. I have some but would like some really nice ones for when I wish to show off or feel extra special. 

I enjoy upgrades. I'm the West Coast Martha Stewart. I get on my own nerves with perfection issues and making things look nice. *laughs* (Can't you just picture what HER game room would look like? I see automatic shelves with delivery systems (picture robots or a conveyer belt) computerized catalog & elaboate scenery/decor for every game.

Ahhhhhh yes, I was introduced to the wonder that is Miscellaneous Game Accessory at the tender age of 2 and had been playing it religiously ever since. Spin the dice, roll the cards, and pray nobody gets a pawn in the eye. And tournament play? You don't know what you're missing! Those Romans knew what they were doing when they came up with this one, a classic that will never be forgotten...no matter how we try.

1 play of "Travel Game", a game from a Christmas cracker. Roll-and-move malarkey, transportation-themed. Don't land on Fall Back In Time, or you'll be sent back to the waterfall you sailed/flew up near the beginning. Also features the Bermuda Triangle and an almost impassible block of send-back spaces near the end bit. Still, any game that provokes that kind of hysterical laughter must be worth something. Rating: 4.

There now is an entry for prototypes, so I no longer have to use this. So I'll rate my gizmos. The G8 timer is awesome to use, if a bit cumbersome to set up (8/10). Old school chess clocks are easy and functional, useful without being too gaudy (8/10). Dice are always fun (9/10). Glass gems are very useful in play testing and making prototypes (10/10). Decks of cards are probably under traditional card games. Stacking chips are sometimes useful, but not a be-all bit (5/10). Even so, stacking chips in several colors are more useful than traditional poker chips (4/10). Colored cubes are on par with stacking chips, great for prototyping, and somewhat more ergonomic (6/10). Rubber bands are a mixed bag (4/10). Play money is useful, but a chore to put away afterwards (5/10). A Magic 8-Ball is seldom useful, but when it is, it's exactly the right thing to use (5/10). And the Dice Boot dice tower is wonderful, even though it rarely gets used these days (7/10).

Little things one must have.  Among the things I have are colored beads or stones used to mark off disks played (Attika) or areas not to be used (Power Grid).  Various games need extra parts (CheapAss Games) and of course sometimes the money or tokens that come in games themselves need replacing.

Nothing can spice up a game better than an added game accessory for theme or feel. My best example is our use of coins.

We use [b]replica Spanish coins[/b] (Reales, Escudos, Dubloons, Pieces of Eight..) instead of the whimpy coin markers most games come with. The weight and sound of the coins adds SOOO much to the game. The coins are also used in a variety of other games we play. If you buy from this dealer, the MC002 mixed set seems to be plenty for a game of Puerto Rico or Pirate's Cove. We typically count silvers as 1's and Gold as 5's, but I've made a handy chart of the true values of these coins, for those who want a more advanced form of poker chip.
www.piratesofthecoast.com/shop/coins.html

[b]Advancing Hordes[/b] seems matchless for dice.

My favorite source for misc game accessories: [b]Archie McPhee[/b]!
www.mcphee.com

[b]American Science & Surplus[/b] has tons of odds and ends which can be used in creative ways for gaming. I've gotten everything from glass stones, marbles and storage containers.

Epic and inspired or pointless and inane? Only the designer knows, and he died 5 years ago in a freak fishing accident.

My gaming group is threatening to put me on the rack and scald my nipples with white hot irons if I bring it out again, so the chances of its rating improving are low.

This game is broken (at least some bits are). I really like the DiceBoot and clear piece of plexi for holding maps down and I wouldn't be without my collection of baggies & card protectors.

Not sure what to do with the counter trays since they seem to be worth a bit on Ebay, but I prefer baggies.

* Poker Chips
* Card Shuffler
* Giant plexiglass cover
* Lots of extra dice.  Mostly 6 sided, but also 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 20.  Used to have 7-siders but I can't seem to find them.

Two things that I'm really looking for:

* Transparent hex battle mat with dots in the centers and individual hex numbers.  I knew a friend that had one, so I know they exist.
* A nice, wooden and felt, dice tower.

The original set of these has an extra 5th mini. It's odd that in the new set of 4 they left in the long one, when that is too large for the game. They should have left in the one they took out. Happily for me I got 2 sets way back. Painted, these are Sweet! With the new smaller set you'll still need 2 sets to make them useful, and forget about using that large train - this will give you a total of 6 usable trains, which should at least be painted in different player colors.

Crayon rails with a train that lets you point the direction is a big improvement over the silly plastic pawns that come with the game(s). This is 'must have' for a crayon rail fan, even if they are unpainted.

At least use TTR minis or some such, in order to show the direction your train is headed.

This offer is for 400 poker chips.
For a list of games that benefit from the use of poker chips (other than the obvious 18xx games), see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/20492.
This is a set of chips that are casino sized 39mm chips but weigh only 8.5g each which makes them perfect to use as a travel set.
The outer mold area features suits.  There are 4 colors (White, Red, Blue, and Green).  Will be glad to substitute 25 chips in Yellow or if the winner would like (however, the substitue chips have a slightly different rolling edge--the outer mold design is the same).

Offering A sample set of custom-made true clay casino poker chips with inlays of historic train images.  
For a list of games that benefit from the use of poker chips (other than the obvious 18xx games), see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/20492.  These chips are manufactured by ASM on the Hourglass mold.  There are 15 denominated (25-cent - 25,000) chips with 15 different train images in a logical historical progression.  There are an additional 4 non-denominated chips with an additional 4 historic train images.  So, there are a total of 19 different colored chips.  The art set-up charge for the inlay designs alone would cost you $50 - $150 to have done before you even consider the cost of the chips themselves.

This is the greatest box ever designed.  It both holds things and it opens and closes without having to be torn open or taped shut!

Your life is incomplete without this box!

(Why this is its own entry I'll never know.  That said, I do in fact store expansions in this box).

UPDATE: I have this confused with the other Age of Steam Box.

White oak with dark green foam.   It is a little smaller than I was anticipating but that does make it more travel friendly.

The dice tower was bought on Ebay from user dungeonwerksga. He sells them using a buy now price rather than auction so I think you should always be able to order and get a custom made tower. You specify what color foam you want. It is a great size for a travel tower.

This isn't really a game, but it should be used to categorize miscellaneous game related items such as dice, dice towers, dice trays, timers, tokens, pawns and movers, etc. Items in the BoardGameGeek Marketplace may refer to items listed here.

If there is a more specific [boardgamefamily=4347] for your item, use it instead. For example, there's an entry for [boardgame=33456 card game accessories], another for [boardgame=31693 [b]miniatures[/b] accessories], and others.

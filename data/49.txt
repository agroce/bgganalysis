Quick fun game, roughly about 20 mins play.
works well between 2-5 players.

Dont be put off by the pizza theme!

Really like a play mechanic in this game.

Basically the same game as "Sole Mio" but with different pizza's.  Can be combined to create a mega pizza game.

Another enjoyable game from Uwe. I think this one is fun, as long as you don't take it too seriously. I like making a terrible Italian accent, saying things like "That's-a one-a spicy meatball!" I will definitely keep this one around.

The rules to this seem really complicated - don't worry about it, just go ahead and play.  It is a really good, quick and pretty easy 2 player game, and I'm sure it would be even more fun with more people and a few bottles of Chianti.  I can't wait to try.

Good filler.  Very chaotic since it's almost impossible to keep track of the toppings/pizzas that have been played.  Rain Man would be unbeatable at this game.

RATING: 4
Blah meh. Pick a card, play a card. Didn't find myself agonising over the decisions I had to make which translates as a boring game to me. It was always obvious what the best choice was. As a random past time activity I'd rather play something that provokes laughs and plays fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lot of fun and I'm happy to play anytime, BUT there's not really a lot to it.

There are two faults, really.  One, there's no penalty for playing a pizza and not making it.  Two, if someone plays the Bombastica early then the rest of that turn is empty and can go on a long time.

Having said that, the cards are nice, it's good to play with kids and it's a pleasant memory game.  I can't be too harsh on it - and I do like pizzas!

Both Plumpsack and King Loui are better memory games to play with a fmaily or small group.

RATING: 8
The key to winning, and also to greater fun, in this &quot;memory game&quot; is to disrupt the memory of your opponents by playing your menu cards generously.  Since there is no penalty for failing to fulfill an order, there is no reason not to do so.  Some Bridge players yell &quot;penalty double!&quot; when they play an order card similar to the one just played by their upper seat, betting on that their upper seat cannot fulfill his order, thus leaving the ingredients for their own attempt.

RATING: 5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Mamma Mia is a pretty simple card game. It has an interesting sort of memory/planning mechanic, which I have never seen before, but it's not enough to make it a game I find particularly enjoyable - even in the category of light card-games.

Clever mechanisms, fast and easy to play, but I don't really care about it. Mamma Mia is a mediocre card-game and a pass for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like (or liked, I think I have overplayed it) this game a lot. Really entertaining use of the memory component. Depending of your memory capability you can approach the game with different strategies and still enjoy and even win the game. Very portable and it needs little table space. Frequently my choice when traveling. You can play it on the beach or in the airplane table. Maybe for this reason my copy is in such a bad state despite the high quality and resistance of the cards.

A fun memory game that will probably make you hungry for pizzas.

Follow these rules when playing with fewer than 5 (not in the Rio Grande edition rules): "With fewer than 5 players remove ingredient cards: with 4 players remove one of each ingredient and return them to the box, with 3 players remove three of each, and with 2 players remove five of each."

Recommended with 2-5 players (best 4). 30 mins.

This is a game that Tom Vasel introduced me to.  My wife really likes it, and so she bought it for me for Christmas.  It's a good game, I enjoy playing it fairly often, and am never disappointed about the outcome of the game.  It usually provides fodder for laughter, even when playing with non-native English speakers.  I bumped the weight up to light medium because of the memory you need to be really good at the game.

Here&#039;s a good example of a game I really like finally settling in to the rating it probably deserves from me.  It started out at a 10.  Yeah, that was just love at first sight.  After many, many plays, I dropped it to an 8.  Where it sat for a while.  Problem is, the game also sat for a while, and when I pulled it out again after a long hiatus, well... some of the bloom was off.  Still fun.  Though we don&#039;t do the accents as much as we used to :)

Very fun filler game.  I thought it would be a memory game where you just had to remember what was played, but it turns out that there's too much going on to keep track of what's been played.

RATING: 8
Back when Uwe Rosenberg cared about clever card-play rather than cutting peat or harvesting wheat.

In Mamma Mia players try and make delicious pizzas by playing ingredient cards into a common stack.  Once someone feels like the right amount of peppers or mushrooms (or whatever) is sitting in the stack they can play a "recipe" card in there as well.  The round is resolved after several rounds of this.  The cards are revealed in the order they were played and players hope that there is still the ingredients left by the time their played recipe cards emerge from the stack.

A fresh and unique card game.  recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very funny theme. The players try to bake pizzas, but they're all using the same oven, sometimes someone will use the ingredients you have put there to bake their own pizzas. A bit of a memory aspect in this game you have to remember what ingredients were played in the oven and if there are enough and the right ingredients to make your own pizzas. Plays fast.

Bought from local op-shop for $1 (St Luke's).
Rules: http://www.abacusspiele.de/?m=spiele&action=download&pdf=367
Oddly, these rules don't involve a Mama Mia card, which my game has. There are a couple of HTML rule sheets in the file section of the BGG page for this game.

EDIT: here's the Rio Grande rules (as in my deck):
http://riograndegames.com/getFile.php?id=60
They're on the RG website but I couldn't locate them going in front door - had to Google search! I've found this before with older RG games (eg El Grande & Samurai) - there are archived rule sheets available but the site doesn't have an archive link and their games search only seems to find current games (in this case the related Sole Mio! can be found but not Mamma Mia! [nor Mamma Mia! Grande]).

I've enjoyed my games of Mamma Mia!, but am not enticed to get it out to play over and over again.  Game mechanic is basically memory or card counting, then getting lucky or where you are sitting.   If you lay down a pizza, and you are in a four player game, there is a very good chance the following three people won't lay one down and you can act again.  A decent filler, but I'd prefer to play others.

A quirky and unique memory game.  Kupferkessel Ko doesn't play more than two, so Mamma Mia! is great for when there's more than two.  :)  Rules are really hard to explain for such a simple and light game, but after one "baking" people usually get it and are eager for more.

Very easy to learn quick, and fun family game that can fit in your pocket.

One thing that bothers me is a luck factor of which cards you get, and play: other players can use your toppings, and there+s nothing you can do about it. With more players it's more chapotic, so I would say perfect nuber of players for this game is 3. Tough I haven't played much with 2.

Delicious little card game. 
One of the few games with a memory element I really like. It is curious how difficult to explain the simple mechanisms are; basically, you have to play a test round (or at least show how the baking stack is evaulated).

A fun memory game wherein you try to remember what all has gone into the oven, and you fill your orders based on your memory of the contents of the oven.  Sometimes, you luck out, and other people's failed orders leave just enough in the oven for your orders to go through.

RATING: 9
Hrm, it's ok.  It requires a good memory to be played well, which means I will forever stink at it.  Not the hugest fan of memory games.  It's hard to believe the same guy made Agricola! (2007, initial rating 6)

April 2011:  This is a really weird game.  I can't think of many card games that are less intuitive than this, and more confusing on initial play(s).  

I can't imagine reading the rules for the first time and trying to explain it to someone else.   Whoever wrote the rules must have spent days agonizing about how to explain the game.

Still, once you work it out, there's a pretty nifty game here.  Much of the strategy comes down to not only working out if there's enough stuff between pizzas, but in determining when other players will fail in their pizzas, giving you pizza possibilities.   

Sep 2015:  Rating up to an 9.  This game is quite masterful...

Fun game -- very different from any other card game I own.  Before acquiring this I was worried about the memory element in the game, since I don't tend to enjoy memory games.  But it is only one element among several other elements, and did not detract from my enjoyment.

Unlike a lot of poll respondents, I enjoy the 2 player game too.  It's one of those rare card games that I enjoy with 2,3, and 4 players (and probably 5, though I have never played with this many).  It is also fun for a range of ages, with enough strategy to keep the adults engaged. A must-buy for families with kids ages 6 and up, in my opinion.

UPDATE:  We've been playing this again lately.  Great game -- upped my rating from 8 to 9.

I've flaunted both the rating guidlelines and my own usual practice a bit to give this game an '8'. Based on my own desire to play it again, I think it gets a 5 or 6, and usually for me a game tips over to an 8 in part when it becomes limitlessly replayable. But I've given Mama Mia! and 8 despite my lack of desire to play it again just because we played it a *lot* in the year or two after it came out, and because it's an unusual, engaging game. While Mama Mia's replayability isn't in the top-tier, it's very good for a small-box cardgame, and I consider it *easily* Rosenberg's second-best game (after Bohnanza).

A fun little memory game which I am sure I have played before but apparantly I never ranked it. Try to make as many pizza orders as possible by remembering what is in the ingredients stack or trusting to luck that you will have the ingredients in hand to use when the time comes to make the pizza. 1 Play.

A memory game that I can play without having to fully memorize everything, just kind of track stuff and play a bit by intuition. This makes it better, for me, than a full on must memorize everything game.

However, it is still just a memory game, and lacks excitement, for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Decent little memory game. My one issue is being able to play cards from your hand to complete an order after the round is over. There's already no penalty for not fulfilling an order (which is silly in itself)... why make it even easier?

RATING: 6
Mamma Mia this game was hard to play! I just managed a single play and only with 2 players in total (the other player was very experienced with the game), and I didn’t have a chance. It’s an evil little memory game in which there are lots of options to make clever plays – however, after one game I find it hard to grasp how to play! Not that I don’t understand the rules, but there are some subtle strategies like when you play a pizza even though you don’t want to complete it. 

Also, it’s a huge advantage if you can keep track of which cards have been played, but this part is very hard when you aren’t experienced. I will try it with my wife as she might either really love it – or really hate it… For now I am not quite sure which rating the game deserves, so I will give it a medium rating and see what I feel after a couple of plays with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The idea is simple: play an ingredient or (if you think there are enough down already) play a pizza that can be made from those ingredients. The hand limit of seven cards is interesting (balance of ingredients and pizzas) but I didn't enjoy this much at all. It feels very chaotic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Understand that this is not a memory game, despite what people tell you.  If you can remember every ingredient that's been played, that might give you a slight advantage for the first couple of turns in a round, but that's all.  It's more important to assess whether a player's going to be able to fill an order that he's played, and then keep track of whatever leftover ingredients will be useful for your next order.

Quick-playing, wonderful little game.  Relies significantly on memory but the fun comes from the combination of memory and strategic/tactical elements.  Plus there is a role for bluffing as well.  A touch of good humor makes the game a big winner with our group.  Make sure that you remove some cards if playing with fewer than 5 players (remove 1 of each ingredient for 4, 3 for 3, and 5 if playing with two players.)

Another memory game that my wife likes to play. I'm not a big fan of memory elements in games so I'm lukewarm to it. However, it does play quick and has a unique theme that will likely allow it to stick around in my collection. The art is simple but effective and the rules are easy to understand so an overall decent game.

RATING: 7
This is another nice filler that's good for smaller numbers of players.  It's a memory game, but unless one has extraordinary memory (which definitely does not describe me), it's also a betting game in some ways.  Do I want to bet that the previous player who put down a pizza order will be able to complete it, or do I want to play more conservatively?

Surprisingly fun game.  After reading the rules, I thought this would be a fairly dull card counting exercise.  But card counting does not always pay off here.  First of all, it is legal to hold cards in your hand (or even hope to draw them later) to make your pizzas.  Also, you can throw in an order card you know can't be fulfilled to mess up other people's card counting (one of my husband's favorite moves).  This hap-hazard approach makes us both laugh, especially at the end of a round when we see how far off some of the orders are.  This game is fun to play whether you are winning or losing, and also travels well.  We play 2-player, and have tried 3, which is pretty hard to keep track of.  I imagine it would be very chaotic with more players.

Interesting memmory component, made all the better by the ability to finish orders with ingredients in hand.  This mechanic makes some push your luck possible, as you can try to draw the required ingredients to well after you have completed the order.

If I have a complaint, it is that the penalty for failing to make a pizza is too lenient.  It should hurt to miss the order, and by the rules, it does not.

In the end, this was another game that felt just fine.  As I accumulate more and more games, I want things that really wow me.  Although this is a great family game, it just didn't pack the punch I was looking for.  Traded.

Febrero 08. Regalo de cumpleaños a Susana. Generación X, 10,50€.

A cada jugador se le dan 8 cartas de pedido de pizza que debe completar. En su turno pone cartas de ingredientes (pepperoni, champinhones, pinha, pimiento y aceitunas) y si quiere una carta de pedido a un mazo comun. Se trata de conseguir los ingredientes suficientes para tu pedido teniendo en cuenta que los otros jugadores tambien colocan ingredientes y ordenes, por lo que puede que no haya tantos como contabas.

Along with Sole Mio, I find this game almost irritatingly light...it's inoffensive and I don't mind the luck or memory elements, but I also don't find it terribly interesting.  I think it'd be a big hit with children and families with children though, and I'm glad it's out there for them if not me.

A seemingly simple card game in which players take turns discarding cards then drawing to hand limit.  Players share a common deck of ingredients.  Each player has a small deck of unique but similar pizza orders.  Cards are discarded to form the oven which is shared by all players.  Memory comes in when choosing when to play an order card.  At the end of each round the oven is sorted out in the same order cards were added.  Each time an order is encountered the ingredients are checked.  If there are enough for that pizza, the ingredients are removed and the order is returned to the player as filled while unfilled orders are returned to the player's order draw deck.  Unused ingredients remain in the oven.

It's a clever game that will be a good filler.  It doesn't work well with 2 using the supplied rules.

Not bad if you don't mind a minor memory element. The thing I like about it is that even though there is a memory element, you have to factor in the unknown at the same time. There will be certain incregiants available, but after the first couple orders come in, you don't know whether they will actually be filled, which means you don't really know what ingredients will be available, even if you can remember them all.

Components: Very attractive cards that function perfectly (except the miscellaneous pizza orders, which are non-intuitive) and have a nice, linen finish. Whereas in previous editions the ingredient cards had the black-and-white Abacus logo on the back, more recent versions feature the Mamma Mia! logo, which is better aesthetically.

Experience: Very innovative design, blending set collection with memory. I enjoy trying to recall if there are enough ingredients in the mix to satisfy my opponent's order, or if I might be able to capitalize on the ingredients with an order of my own; I also enjoy having to stash an ingredient or two to ensure I hang on to them to use when my order comes up.

[7 July 2017] - 6 (1 play)
A light card game where everyone is trying to play cards to a single stack. These cards can either be ingredients and orders. When all players have played their cards, the stack is turned over and looked at from the oldest cards down to see if the orders had ingredients in the stack when played to fulfill them. This means players are competing with each other for resources and also trying to remember what's been played. Concept was good but the icons of the different food orders was confusing and tough to understand.

What I liked
I really liked this game. It played fairly fast and the baking the pizzas round wasn't as tedious as what I thought it would be.

What I didn't like
The theme feels tacked on and doesn't really work,

Overall
I was concerned that there wasn't enough depth, as the pizzas didn't really vary a great deal but after playing it wasn't too bad. Although the theme is a bit pasted on it is fun and light hearted.

A memory game where it is impossible to keep track of available ingredients to fill out an order, because the order cards can be randomly flung onto the stack, since there are no penalties for an unfulfilled order. The game is also so heavily dependent on luck that it is almost pointless. Very overrated here on BGG, probably due to its "funny" theme. Which isn't really funny at all. Avoid.

This game is surprisingly fun for being a memory game, at which I'm usually bad.  The Mamma Mia round can be kind of clumsy, especially for the Mamma Mia player, but the zany theme and the suspense make up for it.

This could maybe be made in to a cooler game with some work.  But just really isn't fun.  Maybe if you didn't announce the count of the ingredient you place?

Fun memory game about making pizzas. Players have a deck of eight pizzas they have make, using ingredients cards in five flavours. On their turn they may play any number of ingredients of one type onto a pile, followed by one pizza order. When the deck is dry, the pile of cards is flipped over and processed. As ingredients appear, they are sorted by type. When a pizza order appears, if the ingredients are available, the pizza is made. Cards may be added from a player&#039;s hand to complete a pizza. Clever little game, gets played a lot.

3 fővel próbáltuk ki. Valószínűleg, ha régebben játszom vele, akkor nagyobb tetszést vált ki. A mechanizmusa amúgy elég érdekes. A lényeg, hogy jól kell időzíteni a rendeléskártyák lerakását, miután mindenki közösen tölti fel a sütőt az összetevőkkel. Néha nagyon nem sikerült követni, hogy milyen összetevők kerültek a sütőbe. Természetesen volt olyan, amikor a saját rendelésemet azért nem sikerült teljesítenem, mert előzőleg éppen én használtam el az összetevőket egy másik rendelésem teljesítéséhez :). (2017.04.10)

Agradable filler, me habian dicho que era un juego tontuno y en parte lo es, pero a mi entender hay un margen para la gestión de mano, mínimo margen para la estrategia, pero lo hay, tiene un poco de tensión en no saber a ciencia cierta a veces si vas a cumplir tus pizzas o no y la parte de cocinar las pizzas esta muy bien, me gusto bastante el juego y no me arrepiento de su compra, el unico pero es que la versión de Homoludicus viene en una caja gigante quien saber porque que le quitas transportabilidad, me hubiese gustado que la caja fuera la del filler de toda la vida (Coloretto, Land unter, Toma 6!, etc).

Uwe es sin duda mi diseñador favorito.

This is one notch down from Rosenburg's Bohnanza, but it shorter and just as innovative. A very good game for non-gamers and younger gamers, but can be enjoyed as filler as well.

A fun fast card game. Requires some depth of thought in the deployment of your cards and memory comes significantly into play. The strategy is in the toppings. Pizza orders are filled by a randomly chosen player and this is where tactics are employed. The rule governing management of the discard deck is at the brilliant core of this lovely little game.

Seems strange to play a game about pizza's, but that's just why it is fun to play with friends. As long as you're in the good mood, it's OK. You can have a lot of good plans for making a specific pizza, but suddenly another player can interfere with your plan!

Based on several plays.
+ Very enjoyable. One of the best light games I know.
+ Good theme. Almost makes sense, too.
+ Thanks to the possibility to play ingredients at the end of round, analysis paralysis is not a problem here.
+ Bombastica!
> With 4 or 5 players, there are a lot of chaos.
> We play two rounds instead of three. The third round may be boring if one has only one unfinished pizza left.
- I've seen some printing errors on pizza cards.

Rated after one play.  Pretty fun, and easy enough to pick up as long as somebody familiar with the game can keep reminding you about some of the more obscure pizza types (minimale and maximale).  Some element of memory, but with enough players there's enough chaos that it doesn't matter so much.

RATING: 4
A pizza ingredient memory game, with a twist. Since a player can fulfill recipe requirements using cards from his hand, it throws a wrench into the proceedings. I suppose it's always best to assume that a recipe will be completed when you play your own recipe card. Not bad for a memory game, but it does have a good dose of luck in it and it breaks down with more than four players so this is as high as I can go for it.

A great memory game for adults.  I'm not sure why those I've played it with haven't seemed to like it as much as I do.  I think you need to play it aggressively in order to ensure your opponents won't fill all their orders - if your opponents sit back and wait until they're sure their order can be filled, it's almost too easy to fill yours in the meantime.

As a designer, Uwe Rosenberg seems to be the anti-Knizia. Whatever you may think of his games otherwise, there is always some sort of innovative mechanism, some idea you haven't seen implemented before, or some fascinating tweak that makes "same old" feel like something completely different, no matter if it is a big box game or a small card game like Mamma Mia.

The strong memory element here doesn't bother me as much as I would have thought. Mamma Mia is a quick, fun card filler, and depending on what kind of group you're playing with it can be as much a memory game as a game of bluffing, betting and gambling.

Typical Uwe Rhosenburg, a card game with a weird twist.  In this case, you are all trying to build a pizza by discarding cards from your hand to the oven.  When all the cards are discarded, you flip the discard pile over and read off each of the cards.  You better hope the necessary ingredients come up before your pizza does or you lost your gold opportunity.  It's basically a memorization game, but it's simple, fun, and fast, and it's about pizza!  This is a great game for non-gamers because it's so intuitive and easy to learn, but a lot of fun.

Rosenberg is the master of thinking up interesting things to do with a deck of cards. In this game, players play onto a big stack until the end of the round, then the cards resolve in order, with help from player's hands. A little tricky at first, and an unfortunate test of memory, but other than that it's pretty fun. In general, hand management skills outweigh memorization.

Mamma Mia! is a great mix of set collection, memory, and hand management. What really makes the whole come together is that the "sets" are being made in a collective pile in the middle of the table and you can't be entirely sure what it is that others are looking to piece together, pizza-recipe wise. Somewhat reminiscent of Rosenberg's Bohnhanza, but without the wheeling and dealing. This game hits heavy for its incredibly small box.

Card game where you are trying to place ingredients on the table in order to complete pizza orders.  It's not a bad game but I just didn't find it very exciting, it becomes rather difficult to keep track of what ingredients have been played (and to minus the ones that have been 'used' by the pizza recipes) by the end of the game, and it becomes slightly random.  But I put this down to my poor memory and I think other people will enjoy this mechanic.

A decent filler game which is quick to learn.

This was a good game with kids, although the younger one (6) would often wait to long to play a completed pizza card and would miss opportunities to do so and would lose by a good margin.  When I told her to take more chances, throw those pizza cards down, she relaxed more and enjoyed it.  Plays very nice with 3 and 4 players.  Quick and  easy, always ended up playing more than one game at a time.

I think here I am being a little too harsh, it is just a filler afterall BUT I would never choose to play this, there are much better fillers. 

Chaotic, big big luck factor and a memory game, 3 big negatives for me. Very little strategy, there is maybe a little more here than I seen in my one playing but I'm not interested in exploring it due to the negative aspects.

It’s been years since I last played Mamma Mia! I remember I liked it a lot at the time, however I have changed a lot during these years and I´m not sure if I still like the game. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating, however I will try you play it again soon and when I do, I will come back and do a proper comment.

I remember I liked it a lot because I enjoy memory challenges and almost no game has memory among its game mechanisms.

This game surprised me - wasn&#039;t expecting it to be as enjoyable as it was given that it relied on memory.  However, once a few cards and orders go down you just kind of play on gut feel (unless you have a very good memory - in which case I don&#039;t want to play this with you).

Good filler card game with a memory aspect. Players have to play their order cards at the right time when there are enough ingredients available. Not sure though how much influence I really have. Gameplay is really easy but it takes some time to understand this. It fills the same spot as King Lui which is still a bit lighter. What is it that I enjoy card games about eating so much? Personal variant: it's cheese, not pineapples!

The theme of making pizza is very original and quite fun.  The memory aspect is challenging, but not too taxing - it seems like most everyone will just make educated guesses.  I guess if you played with a hardcore card counter it wouldn't be very fun.  But this is a nice lighthearted card game - Uwe Rosenberg seems like he's really good at making those!

Update, 7/12 - About 5 years after rating this for the first time, I have to definitely revise my rating. While I haven't gained any skill in the game, it is such a blast to play. I love both giving people grief for being greedy and being greedy yourself. It's impressive when people pull off certain pizzas and rewarding when you can make it happen. One of the best card games, so unique and quick that it is just about perfect. Up from a 7 to a 9.

Great Little memory based game.  This is my favorite filler.  Be sure to take out cards if you are playing less than 5 (a rule that was forgotten in the original English rules).

Maybe it's just because I played this after a marathon game of Antiquity, but Mamma Mia really hits the spot, even though it's basically a memory game where you're trying to remember what you need in your hand after five or six turns of discarding, and figuring out how to get it there. I mean, don't get me wrong, the results are exactly as arbitrary as the other players' memories are imperfect. That doesn't bother me too much, though. 

Maybe I only like Mamma Mia because I get the chance to make the only decent flavor of pizza, pineapple pepperoni.

A Uwe Rosenberg game I don't mind as much as his others. But I still never request it.

Edit: After a 7th play, I have to say I really [i]do[/i] mind playing this game. Each card you have to complete requires more than one type ingredient, but you're only allowed to play one type. Your opponent can put his pizza order down and basically steal everything you've been planning. You can't ever really get anything done except by chance. I feel like I have no sense of control over my own destiny when I play this game. Even when I win, I do not enjoy it at all.

Acquired pre-2003. Total number of plays is in the 30-50 range. This is a fun and interesting memory game that really requires you to stay on your toes. Lose concentration midway and you've probably thrown away the game (unless everyone else does too). There's a nice gambling aspect that emerges after several plays too. One drawback of this game is that when I teach the game (and I don't think it's just me), new players are just confused about how it works. I strongly suggest a "test round" for new players, and then it clicks.

Uwe Rosenberg does it again. There's really no other memory game like it. If an ingenious memory mechanism wasn't enough, the theme's totally slick too. It's another one of those simple games that's hard to teach, but it's well worth the trouble. [b]7.5[/b]

RATING: 6
It's not a very difficult game to play, and it's also pretty quick.  It can be frustrating to have ingredients sucked out from in front of you, especially since you can never be certain about a player's ability to fulfill an order.  Perhaps if we played with a bit more bluffing, the game could reach new levels of enjoyment.

A very unique game with very unique game mechanic. In Mamma Mia! players needs a good memory, that's why this is a good game with children too (because children has better short memory than adults have). Mamma Mia! is a funny pizza making card game by Uwe Rosenberg but not as good as Bohnanza.

Several plays.  I'm now pretty sick of this game.  It's a memory game, and those have their own issues.  I enjoyed the game I played, but my position changed at the drop of a hat, due to no faults on my part.  You really can't plan ahead in this game - meaning, if you make a play and expect to draw a card, you're just asking for trouble (at least I am), despite the fact that you're drawing MANY times before a round ends.  It's decent enough as filler, but otherwise forgettable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The only thing I don't like about this game is that it is a memory game and I have a bad memory.

The concept is interesting, but of course, it does not really reflect well the process of ordering and building pizzas.

Still, it's a quick filler.

There are many expansions for this game, I am not sure if they make the game really better.

RATING: 5
Basically a memory game to some degree as you try to remember what is available in the stack of ingredients so you know when it is safe to throw your recipes into the oven.  There is some decisions to make as to what ingredients to throw when and how much you want to risk a pizza if you cannot remember the ingredients in the oven, but there is no negative penalty if you cannot complete your pizza other than it being a wasted move or two.  However, usually one mistake is enough to lose you the game so...

I'm really taken with the rules to this, but the two or three times I've tried to play it, it seemed nobody else in the group really clicked to it.

In the time since, I lost a bunch of the cards in a move, so I can't even evaluate it again until I re-buy it.

Still, I'm going to stand pat on my 6 rating because I really like the game's freshness in concept and theme.

Mamma Mia should be on the NHS as it is certainly my best chance of fending off alzheimers.  A difficult and slightly chaotic memory game this takes time to pick up and should be introduced gently into a game group by one or two people who have played it before.  Unlike the subject I dont think it will taste good served cold but it does warrant coming back to again and again.  Mamma Mia is an unhealthy subject but very healthy brain exercise.

I love this game. Easy to learn, memory based - so it's great to play with kids - and fun for a group who prefers lighter games. It's as complicated as you choose to make it: it's possible to win without keeping track of which cards your opponents have played, but if you can, you can make more informed plays. One of my favorite low-key, accessible filler games.

I enjoy this game.  Some people seem to think this is a simple memory game.  Man, are they wrong.  There's no way you can predict what ingredients are going to be taken when people play their joker orders.  Sure, you can guess, but it's just a guess.  There is a bit of skill involved.  That is, you've got to seriously consider what ingredients you lay down (especially your preferred ingredient since it is often very useful to your opponents) or when to place your order (Is that guy going to use pineapple for his joker order or all those olives that appear to be unclaimed so far?).  Game isn't heavy, but can be agonizing.  And fun to play for non-gamers.

I'm fine with the memory element, but the game didn't grab me. A number of people whose tastes overlap with mine rate it well though, so I'll give it another go.

Some editions specify tweaking the deck for different player numbers. Mine doesn't, but using the whole deck with two players lacks tension. (From each ingredient, [geekurl=/article/10399028#10399028]remove 5/3/1/0 for 2/3/4/5 players[/geekurl].)

Ever wish there were memory game for adults? There is, by Uwe Rosenberg, designer of the best cardgame of all time (Bohnanza), no less. This isn't as everlasting as Bohnanza, but it's unique, quirky and fun, and sure, it's still relevant after all these years due to lack of competition.

A quick fun filler. Memory is not as important in this game as some have implied. It's usually a good idea to track enough ingredient cards to ensure you can fill one order, after that don't bother. My complaint about this game is that I suspect that there is a single optimal strategy. That strategy is to draw as many of your menu cards as you can early in the deck and then play one on each turn such that you have most if not all ingredient cards left by the end of the deck. You won't fill all of those menu cards but you'll be surprised how many of them you do fill.

RATING: 5
A cool little card game about making pizzas. Players play ingredients one at a time into a single discard pile, then whenever they think there are enough ingredients to make a pizza recipe, they play the pizza face down on top of that pile. Play it too early, and you might be ingredients short from scoring it. Play it too late, and you risk your opponents claiming the ingredients. You won't know until the end whether you were successful, so the further along you get, the less you can be sure of which ingredients are left over.

Scoring is done by flipping the pile up-side-down and revealing the cards one by one. Once a pizza is revealed, the player who owns it has to take the appropriate ingredients from the pool if they can in order to fulfill the requirements. If there aren't enough the player don't score the pizza and the ingredients are left over. This continues until all the cards have been revealed.

                                                   component. Memory games, as a class, are often children&#039;s games because they give
                                                   kids a chance against adults. The memory aspect here has that effect to some degree,
                                                   but the cardplay and sheer volume of cards make it not the dominating aspect of the
                                                   game. Lots of quick fun, especially with pre-teen aged kids.

played only 2 player so far, hated two player and added home rules before the first game was over.  Maybe more than 2 is better (think it probably is).  Otherwise it is a simple enough game to learn and leans heavily on your ability to remember what cards were played earlier.

I am a Mamma Mia master!  Rarely lose this game.  I love it, but don't ever count cards, just have a kind of 'feel' for it.  Also, it helps to get rid of all your orders each round, and make sure your hand has a lot of ingredients going into the pizza-making phase.

Fill pizza orders by putting ingredients and pizza orders into a common pile of cards. When all cards have been played, go through common pile to see if orders filled. 
Some memory required, and a good dose of luck. It's a fun game, but not too satisfying  as a strategy game, since all you can do is attempt to fill out orders based on what you have in your hand.

Light and slightly chaotic memory game for adults. I don't have any non-children memory games, and thus Mamma Mia! serves an important purpose in my collection, as I like memory games. Fast, fun and definitely a filler for families.

I tend to dislike card and dice games that are heavily luck-driven, and this is another example. To its credit, the theme is cute, the mechanics interesting and it goes by quickly enough. Some claim this is a memory game but I can only imagine those with severe short-term memory disabilities having any difficulty with this part of the game. What matters much more is that you have the right order card available to take advantage of the ingredients as they hit the table. Invariably, I either don't have the right order card available (despite a handful of them) or someone plays the same card right before I do. If the cards are with you it can be fun, but the frustration level is kept to minimum as the game moves pretty swiftly. I won't be requesting this game anytime soon, but if someone in my group has a pining for the pizzas, I'd be happy to oblige. ***UPDATE*** After several more plays, my opinion remains exactly the same.

A cardgame where you need a right mixture of short-term memory, cardplaying skill and a bit of luck. The more I play Mamma Mia! the more I seem to appreciate it. Works very well with full range of 2-5 players. An excellent card game.

Update (20.1.2009): Slowly but surely Mamma Mia's rating has risen from 8 to 9 to 10. At 25 games played and it seems to get better and better by every play.

An easy, fast and fun pizza-making card game by Uwe Rosenberg.  Nice, textured cards with lovely colour artwork of pizza ingredients.  I love how the play starts - (from the rules) "Play begins with the hungriest player and continues clockwise around the table."  Can be difficult to fill some of the larger orders but there is so much satisfaction when you fill a Pizza Bombastica!  There is tension at the end of every round as the ingredients are stacked in piles and the orders start coming out.  So annoying when someone's order comes out just before your own and uses up all your ingredients!  Mamma Mia!  Another game I bought new based on BGG recommendations.

[b]Mamma Mia[/b] was sold via auction 7/7/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I still think Mamma Mia is a great family game, but our family game nights have slowed down since my wife started her business. Thus games like Mamma Mia hardly get played anymore. Additionally Mamma Mia is best with four, I've played with two and three and the game just isn't as good without the full compliment of players. Because of that I ended up getting trading our copy since Mamma Mia won't beat out the classic fillers we all like to play [i](games like For Sale, Cockroach Poker and Coloretto)[/i].[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great family card game filler that is simple to learn.
- Yes there is a memory element, but you can still do well if your memory is as bad as mine.
- The game play is unique, I haven't played anything quite like it. It's basically a combination of set collection with a common pool of cards and memory.
- Personally I much prefer this over Uwe's more popular card game Bohnanza. 

I've read a lot about Mamma Mia and finally decided to pick up a copy even though I really don't like games that involve having a good memory (mine is awful). In this game it's okay because you aren't trying to remember where a certain card is in a tableau, but rather how many of each ingredient has been played into the common pile. You can also bail yourself out by playing cards from your hand if you're short on toppings for your pizza. I'd highly recommend this for families, my wife and kids all enjoyed it and it'll be coming out with our regular rotation of filler games. [/i]

Wonderful game! I held off on purchasing this game because I thought it was just another simple memory kids game! Boy was I wrong! This game is a superior little game for 2-players and I suspect great fun and maybe even more chaotic with more players! Card counting seems to be part of the game and is quite fun when dealing with the Pizza Bombastica (the 15 ingredient pizza)!

RATING: 8
50+ plays. An excellent card game with a super matching of mechanic to theme, throwing the ingredient cards into the oven pile, together with the recipes to see if your pizzas get cooked. It's a memory game, but a good memory often doesn't help because any surprise non-cook of a pizza means the ingredient pile will be dramatically different from where it would otherwise be. So the game is often played on a wing and a prayer, playing the odds that either the ingredients will be there (from what you've seen so far) or that you'll be able to pick up the missing ingredients that you need into your own hand. This latter drives a lot of decisions through each hand, driving the need to collect recipes at the start of the hand, and then changing the mix to low recipes, mostly ingredients in your hand by the time you finish the hand. It all plays fast, with a theme you can really ham up to with Italian accents, which means a lot of fun. And the mechanic still stands up after all these years.

When I read the rules I thought it could be a very dry experience. It seamed to me that all I had to do on every turn is to calculate the ingredients remaining. 

In fact it works really great. I think the mechanisms that prevent this from beeing just a memory-math exercise is the fact that you can add cards from your hand and the recipies where you can choose the preferable ingridients.

The theme helps a lot also!

Unfortunatelly none I played it with, asks for it.

Based on one play: Although the rules are quite confusing, the game is quite simple. Play ingredients into a general pool and add in pizzas when you believe there are enough ingredients remaining to complete it, but others will do the same, changing what is in the ingredient pool. Everything is played on top of the other, so you must remember. Quick, light and even some laughs.

This game should be renamed "Card Counting: The Game".  Seriously, it's all about keeping track of the numbers of each card people play, and subtracting them from various set cards that people also have played.

TRY Mar/05: Played this wrong the first 2 times; seemed VERY luck-based and impossible to predict.  3rd time, realized that we'd missed parts about playing 3 rounds and not restarting your hands & up ingredients between rounds -- this REALLY impacts the game, and improves it greatly for strategy!

Horrible rule set for learning from; decent for reference.

If you don't actively try to remember what's been played (or if there are distractions, which is always the case in our family), the game loses almost all strategy and becomes an adventure into randomness.

This one fell flat for us.  Neither of us have ever been pick on memory games, and this game is about memorizing the count of cards going into the discard pile as the game progresses.

*A quirky memory game which is best to show than explain how each round is scored. (For an intro I don't include the 3 difficult pizzas and only play 2 rounds).

Close scores, hand management and evil mirth (when your opponents fail to complete an order) makes this a keeper.

This is a memory game where you play ingredient cards into a pile, and then maybe one of your order cards. When the deck runs out, you flip the pile over and see if the pizzas are successful by having all they need in the pile above them, with the ability to supplement from your hand. Dull and light.

A nice filler. You are trying to stack the common ingredient deck with your toppings and pizza orders so yours can be fulfilled but not your opponents

Don't take it seriously, you can drive yourself crazy trying to count cards.

Another Rosenberg's cool card game after Bohnanza.
It has everything a card filler can offer: cute and fresh theme, nice artwork, easy rules and a gameplay that works perfectly.
It feels good when an order is delivered.
Excellent for kids, though probably they won't be to good at it when played with adults as memory and tactics are fundamental here.

Very clever game of card management, memory and bluff.  Simple yet rewarding.  The one thing I don&#039;t like (other than the pineapple.cheese ingredient) is the Mamma Mia rule.  There are various solutions, none of them optimal; I prefer to let the trailing player be Mamma Mia.

There's no denying the memory aspect to this game, but instead of card counting, the real fun is going with your gut sense of what's in the pile.  It adds great tension to the end of the round filling of the orders.  I haven't played this game in a while and thinking about it makes me want to get it back out.  Fun game.

Only Rainman could do well at this game.  Since I'm not him, this game is an excercise in frustration.  I know you can just play it without "trying" but I don't see the point in that.  Plenty of other games out there that are more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun and chaotic filler game, if played the right way (that is not thinking too much what cards have already been played and playing quickly). You start a round with a certain memory element, but very soon all the cards are too much to remember and put orders down by intuition. 

It is really amazing, how Uwe Rosenberg can design both very complex and very light games, which are both a lot of fun in their own way.

Great filler for any number of players. Each player plays any number of one type of pizza ingredients on top of the pile and an optional pizza recipe. The deck fills and once all cards have been played the deck is turned over and dealt out. If all the ingredients for the recipe is out once the recipe is pulled it is complete. It's also possible to use the leftover cards from your hand. Plays quickly but requires a bit concentration when trying to remember which ingredients have been played.

Light memory game that gets quite cutthroat as more players are added. The flow of the game breaks down somewhat with two players, but it's still enjoyable at that number (unlike 2P Bohnanza).

I've found this game to be easy to teach providing that you say from the outset that it's a memory game, and that the idea is to remember which ingredients are in the oven. The personal ingredient idea is great also, as people who have trouble picking a colour seem to feel more strongly about an ingredient.

Update: the poor scaling is annoying me a bit, so I've dropped it to a 6.

This was a quite interesting memory game that at least gives you some leeway for less than perfect memory.  We had a lot of fun with it.  When one player makes a mistake and can't cover it, it opens tha door for others later on.  In fact, there were so many errors, that it became a common strategy to put an order in the oven "just in case".  Sure it's light, but a pleasant diversion none-the-less.
---------------------------------------
The more recent games of this have had fewer "lapses" in memory, leading to a much more competitive game.  I think we are going to try to get this one to the table more often.

RATING: 9
A pleasant surprise. A very original game which is hard to categorize. Yes, it is a memory game, sorta, but it's also a preprogrammed movement game (without the movement) and the feel is similar to many speed recognition games even if there's no speed element here. Or recognition. So, basically all players are shoving ingredients and recipes in one oven, all in strict order. When the oven's full, we check whether recipes can be fulfilled in the order they came in. Add some tricks to muddle the waters (open ingredient recipes, and the option to complete them from your hand, not to mention pizza bombastica) and you end up with a fun little game.

Mamma Mia! is a fairly quick and novel card game in which players need to remember what has been contributed to a pile of ingredients. Players toss their order into the oven when they think it contains the necessary ingredients, but they may also top up the ingredients at the end of the round.
 
I love the pizza-baking theme, but have no idea how a communal oven for everyone's toppings would actually work out in real life. There are a few chances to swipe ingredients away from opponents by placing an early order, but otherwise this is a straight-up memory game with a minor element of hand management involved. I have a soft spot for this game despite the memorisation bit not being to everyone's taste. This plays best with 3P; any more and the game becomes too chaotic.

Deceptively tricky game.  While the gameplay is simple enough for fairly young children, the memory aspect (not just remembering what has been played, but subtracting out of that the ingredients that a subsequent recipe consumed) makes it quite challenging for adults.  

Be sure to check the BGG entry -- the USA rules translation leaves out the fact that you must remove some sets of ingredients when playing with less than 5 people -- it can ruin a 2 player game if you don't realize that.

The stand-alone expansion Sole Mio has complete instructions for fewer than 5 players and adds some nice recipes and dual ingredient cards that enhance the basic game.

So not a fan of memory games...but this is a cleverly conceived memory card game. It's not specifically a children's game and there's none of the usual tile flipping or uncovering items, or dealing with Analysis Paralysis. Instead, this is a light and enjoyable game that plays quickly and has a great theme. Trying to remember what cards were played; which player may or may not have secured the necessary topping for their pizza is challenging but not frustrating. Cards are revealed after each round to determine which player successfully matched the right cards for each of their pizza orders. Highly recommend for a family game or for a quick filler.

Every once in a while a game comes along where I'm impressed at the fine balance between level of unfun and the sheer magnitude of ass stench that the mechanics reveal.  If a friend of mine created this game, I'd really be concerned about how the spend their time.  

What is the point of this game?  You wait for some people to throw down the cards you need then you play your card.  Great for people that think that card counting is a joyous release from actual depth of gameplay. If you don't have an absurd memory or rather not care enough to count toppings then there isn't much game here but to time the cards that you throw down to score points on.  

I just don't get where the fun is.  If people try to build their pizzas then I'm going to throw a card down in hopes to score off of them.  If I don't score, no big deal no penalties.  

What?  

Alright.  

The hands are just too short not to throw cards out randomly. I guess building pizzas could be fun (you know that's why those guys take those jobs for so cheap, oh wait, those jobs kind of suck) but, it just felt like I was discarding some cards in a pile.  Perhaps this is better with less than 5, I doubt I'll ever know.  The only reason that this doesn't get a 1 is that it isn't entirely broken, much like a root canal actually serves its own purpose.

This is a fun little memory game where players mentally track what ingredients are in the pile and try to play their pizza orders at the correct time as to get them filled with the ingredients already played.

EDIT: This is just a fun game that, if I can explain it, my niece and nephew will really like.

Interesting little memory based game that is COMPLETELY unique.

A fun game that relies on memory as a mechanic, rather than logic.

This is a GREAT card game!  I personally prefer this as a 2 player game (it's easier to count cards with just 2 players) ;), but it also works well with more players. Give it a try...It's loads of fun!!!  My friend loves this game so much, she brought it to the hospital so we could play it while she was in labor with her son!!!

RATING: 4
Entertaining with youngsters, and plays pretty quickly.

For serious players, the memory aspect is really straightforward - it's not like counting a deck of playing cards - all you need to remember is how much of each of the 5 toppings are still available in the oven.
It just requires remembering 5 numbers for the amount of each topping - you don't have to remember each card played.

A great card game with unique, innovative mechanics.  Best to explain by playing a sample round or two, since the rules are so different.  Appeals to a wide variety, from children who enjoy the theme of making pizzas to adults who like the excitement of a good card game. A nice combination of skill and luck.  One of the best card games.

RATING: N/A
Cute little game that works pretty well as a filler. It is maybe a bit too much lucky driven or random, mainly because players won't often have the same number of turns but it is something one can simply ignore and have a laugh about it.

One of those cute little filler games that are easy to pick up, quick and loads of fun. This one comes with a memory aspect that leads into a intuition/ risking it  aspect, the theme of building pizzas is quite sweet, overall I like this. It took me going through the whole first round to fully get what we are playing here but that's okay, sometimes a game needs that. Even though I think it is good it doesn't win me over enough to go beyond 6.5* but these stars are on the max. edge of 6.5.

in the first round, you'll wonder what in heck you're doing. it probably won't make any flippin flappin sense until you go through the deck, checking orders against ingredients. then you'll see it's about developing an intuitive sense of what's been played, hand management, pepperoni, risk asessment, timing and mushrooms.

This is a pretty fun game to play with my wife and daughter, but the main problem is trying NOT to remember what cards are played...it takes conscious effort.  We play a lot of trick-taking games in our game group, and while no one exactly counts cards, we're all perfectly capable of keeping track of what's been played in relation to what we're holding in our hands.

I'll have to get it out on a game night and see just what it plays like if everyone pretty much knows what's in the over stack, as well as what's being taken up by the current batch of pizzas.  I have a feeling that it will basically be a game of player-driven chaos--you'll either get to play your pizza fully knowing it'll be cooked, or a player before you will take needed ingredients thereby setting your play back by at least a turn.  I'll add to the comment once we try it.

[RGG 1998 edition] {Food, filler; memory; optimal 4-6p} A nice memory card game. The graphics of the cards are cute. The game system is intuitive and fits the cooking theme well. There are 2 ways of playing Mamma Mia!: remember the cards or disturb the memory of other players. Players tend to disturb the memory of other players because there's no penalty for wrong order cards.

The decisions are easy in Mamma Mia: playing order cards or not, drawing order cards or not, keeping cards or not for fulfilling orders or not, etc. Player who gets the Mamma Mia! card should always make some order. I tend to keep some order cards in my hand, at least 2.

I hate this game having lost the first 12 games, narrowly missing out by one ingredient only to have my wife add insult to injury with 'I dont think I can win this 15 ingredient order' followed by '13plus 2from the hand makes 15'.

It's really very clever and different from any other card game out there.

You'll need a great memory though.

Now what was I saying?

Please note that I have now officially won 1 game! How gratifying!

Wow, what a clever little card game. Uwe did some really interesting things before he started to churn out all those farming games. I probably wouldn't want to play it with someone that had perfect memory, but that wasn't a problem for our group. I particularly liked how you had a fixed hand size of 7 to hold two very different types of cards, drawn from two different piles. How many cards of each type do you hold at any time? Interesting.

It does what it does very well, and nothing else does quite the same thing!  Though I strongly dislike memory games, the information here is complex enough to track and can be thrown off by one badly timed order that it is more a game about going with your instinct than tracking perfect information.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A light filler that I'm terrible at. The problem with this one (maybe I just don't know how to play well) is that if you don't have the right card at the right time, there is nothing you can do about it. Its not too long, so the randomness is ok...

Mamma Mia! is a surprisingly fun game.  I like the memory aspect of the game, because a good memory helps, yet information is not perfect.  Even card counters (of which I know none anyway) would be thrown off when someone adds a bunch of ingredients from their hand to complete a pizza.  Bottom line, the game makes you think and it's fun, which is a winning combination.

Another utterly unique Uwe Rosenberg game. This is one (along with Bohnanza) that I initially disliked, and came around to like quite a bit after giving it a few more tries. A good memory certainly helps, but since there's no penalty for unfilled orders, I place orders often, just for the hell of it.
As an aside, my niece has NEVER been beaten at this game. Her streak exceeds a decade... ridiculous!

Good memory filler with enough decisions, some risk assesment, average luck and a good theme. 

The game declares a whooping 40mins per game.. That's a worst case scenario really. Most games will be more like 10-20min.

I like that the game end is not fixed, but the implementation with the "mama mia" card is poor at best. It's also not the easiest filler to explain to non-gamers.

This was a decent and quick filler card game, but I think I'd pick either Coloretto or No Thanks over this one if given the choice.  Maybe it was the fact that I was already really hungry and this made things worse, but it seemed even more silly and random than Coloretto and No Thanks, which are already light enough for me, if not too light.  It's not bad and maybe worth the low price if you need to fill this niche, but I can't see it coming out all that often.

RATING: 7.5
It has been quite some time that I want to play [thing=49][/thing]. Several times I tried to buy it, but either it was out of stock, or when I wasn't able to make a bigger purchase to add it in. Yet, the desire remained, as [thing=49][/thing] is from the golden days of Uwe Rosenberg, before he did all possible Agricola variations, and was putting out great games such as [thing=11][/thing].

[thing=49][/thing] is a memory game - the participants are trying to make pizzas that require particular sets of ingredients. Players have a hand of ingredients cards and, normally, one pizza, but they can have more pizza, but will have less ingredients - as the maximum hand size is 7. 

The basic rules, as per the description, are: on a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck. After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck, and the ingredients remain. A special type of pizza - the Bombastic - takes all the ingredients available when it shows up, if there are 15 or more of them, otherwise it isn't made. Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!

Overall, [thing=49][/thing] is a simple and straightforward, using just two mechanisms: memory and hand management. It is easy to teach and play. A play flows fast and filled with tension, with all persons trying to use the windows of opportunity to place their pizzas, usually frustrating the others in the process, as the set of ingredients is collectively used, thus when a pizza is placed, the memory needs to compensate for it in order to remember if there are still enough ingredients left to make yours, or if still need more, requiring more time and risk losing the correct timming.

In the end, [thing=49][/thing] has a fine level of interaction. Its rhythm is lively, and it creates a fun and competitive environment, without truly being too agressive or mean. It definitely can work for a light family gaming night or among the more hardcore gamers when in the mood for an uncompromised play. Although memory games tend to demand attention and concentration, [thing=49][/thing] also brings laughter and fun to the table. Recommended.

I bought Sole Mio by accident instead of Mamma Mia and found it to be confusing to teach to new players. The pizza orders are complicated and weird. D'oh! I didn't realize I really wanted Mamma Mia.

We played this with a group w/ a wide age range.. the younger kids liked it..the rest of us thought 1. it required too much memory and 2. it relied too much on luck. The combination of those 2 factors made game play difficult and rather pointless.

Draw and play pizza recipe and ingredient cards in a two phase card game. First phase you are relying on memory of what ingredients are in to complete pizza recipes in the second phase.

Nice light card game of collecting ingredients to fill pizza orders.  There is some memory required, but the game is fun, fast, and not very taxing.

Memory games just are not my thing. (And I'm no good at it) I'm sure there is some strategy in there somewhere...maybe. 

One of the guys in our group points out that perhaps it could be a good game to play with kids. I remain unconvinced. Heroscape handles ages 8+. :)

Played a few times (with 4 or 5 players). A pleasant memory game. Explaining the rules is more difficult than playing the game itself, but usually players get it during or after the first round.

Memory intensive game that is great fun.  Italian accents seem to come out as we play.  Small size lends itself to bringing it to lots of situations in case an opportunity to game comes up.

My wife loves this game and most of my gamer friends do, as well.  What more could I ask for from a game?  One of the best 2-player games I own (plays well with more, but considering the lack of light 2-player games, I usually stick to playing against one opponent).

There's a hefty amount of luck to the card draws, but the mechanics otherwise are quite unique.  A good memory helps, but it doesn't guarantee a win.  There are some great tactical decisions to be made, however the game is also quite accessible to new players too.

RATING: 7
This is my favorite memory game.  Trying to complete set collection scoring cards based on what you think you remember seeing go into the ingredient pile is a nice exercise in how well you do with trackable hidden information... though being able to supplement what is in the pile with the ingredients you keep in your hand lets good hand management assist your poor brain is a nice touch.

I didn't really mind the memory element of this game, but I can't say I truly enjoyed the theme of making pizza using cards as ingredients.  It wasn't fun, not likely to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a really fun game that's hard to explain to people who have never played before.  Might be a good idea to do a sample round to have new players see how the mechanic works.  Goofy Italian accents abound whenever this is pulled out, as the theme is wonderful.

A fast, fun, simple but challenging memory game that plays nicely fron 2 to 5 pizzamen. There's no downtime since you have to pay attention to what others do and you are always thinking about how to manage your hand. This card game is highly recommended for kids and adults and deserves a solid 8!

While this is a memory game, do not be deterred by that. I hate the idea of memory games but enjoy this. It's played more by sensing what's on the pile than by perfectly remembering what's there. This is a great filler.

Juega ingredientes en una pila central boca abajo. Cuando creas que hay suficientes para completar una de tus pizzas colócala encima de ellos. Al final de la ronda se evalúan las pizzas. Si te faltan ingredientes los agregas de tu mano si es que tienes o dejas la pizza en tu mazo. Si hay suficientes lo has logrado.

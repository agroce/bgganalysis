Tactical wargaming for the lazy painter. I like the game system (it's very streamlined and polished) and the miniatures are very nice for pre-paints. I also like the fact that they give you terrain in the base set, plus have additional terrain available in the expansions. Needs more maps.

RATING: N/A
Strongly unbalanced, and the basic rules are just slightly better than one of the worst miniature games in the world (WH40K). Prices too high (30 %u20AC for 6 plastic miniatures... are you crazy or what?).
It is just slightly better than the 40K, so it may be a good thing to play if you have money and don't want/like to paint miniatures (which, by the way, are not so good).

AT-43 is a peculiar game in that it has both great things going for it, yet has elements that totally ruin it. 

What's good: The core rules are simple and very-well conceived. They are also quite fun and they make for fast games with a great flow. The use of cards to select which unit will be activated is both brilliant and fun. The pre-painted models, especially the vehicules are absolutely stunning and although they aren't cheap they are still priced within what I would consider reasonable. All the AT-43 manuals sport gorgeous illustrations and pictures. Very slick production values here. Also, I actually like the backstory and universe which is diverse enough to be interesting without featuring garish stuff like "dwarves with 80's punk haircuts in space", and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  

What's infuriatingly bad: The translation and editing in ALL AT-43 products are appalingly terrible. The rules are often vague, contradictory and open-ended. That is especially true for rules regarding special feats, weapons and characters, It seems like the "geniuses" at Rackham, between their undoubtedly numerous "caf√© et croissants" breaks, think up cool-sounding concepts, shove them withtin the system without ever playtesting any of it. To add insult to injury, the Rackham rep who tries to clarify rules on the official boards has a very limited command of the English language and insists on giving garbled answers "in character" according to which faction is concerned. Ironically those answers often raise more questions than definitely solve a given issue. 

The factions are horribly unbalanced and the point system is plain broken. Succinctly put, a well-stocked Therian force (Babylon 0, Baal Golgotth, Tiamat and a slew of free Hekats begging to be spawned) played by anyone who's not a total retard will steamroll anything put before it. On the other hand of the spectrum the Red Blok faction will need an ungodly amount of "6"s to achieve anything, and it will have to be done on an extremely small map. The three factions, even the dreaded UNA-Mind require a fair amount of consideration when building up one's force in regard to the scenario objectives. It is always a tricky balancing act. That in itself is fine, save for the fact that he Therians are unaffected by such mere details; one force crushes all.   

The game also spawned (pun intended) the most insufferable fanboys since WH40K. That in itself is quite a feat.

To sum it up: awesome miniatures, great core system but otherwise the rules are incoherent, the points are ridiculously unbalanced and the game is simply broken,

RATING: 6
This is a fairly solid system.  The models are nice, the game is fairly easy to learn and fast playing, the theme is very interesting, and the gameplay itself it very fun.

However, it does have some flaws.  Indirect fire is a little powerful (the grounded part is what bothers me the most).  I think the Therian routines might be a little over-powered as well.  And finally, the rush-overwatch combo really dictated the games so far- I'd go onto overwatch with a unit of Bane Goliaths, and I could pin down an entire corridor of troops if they were foolish enough to try to advance.

Like I said, it's a fun game, and I think to fully enjoy it you'll need to leave some of your serious competitiveness behind, or the little flaws will REALLY get to you.  Lucky, I think I have, so I can actually enjoy it =).

The demo game we played was not very balanced, nor thought out. The Terranian tank was unable to pass the doors, for example, making a camp strategy possible. Considering the scenario is kill-all, this is a bit silly. Furthermore, the sides were unbalanced, leading to destruction of the complete Terran team in mere minutes. The mechanics are ok by themselves, but not something that appeals to me personally.

Fast-playing and fun.  Deep enough for tactical manuevering, not so complex in special rules as to tax the brain with analysis paralysis a la Warmachine.

An excellent game, I wish more people in my area played.  It is a more than viable alternative to Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000, and is much easier to learn and play.  The pre-painted plastic miniatures are also a plus with me, as I have two young boys and no time to paint and assemble miniatures anymore.

A nice, prepainted skirmish level game.  The rules are much easier to digest than say... 40k, plus the armies seem more interesting to me (space monkeys anyone?).  Looks like Rackham still intends to expand this universe, which is a great thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Figure and mech' quality is astounding for a pre-painted game. And for $80, you really do get quite a lot for your money: two pre-painted mech-things; two opposing squads; a terrain board and some terrain pieces; basic rules, dice, and even a customized tape-measure for use with the game. As a toy purchase, it's a marvel. Even the cardboard box it comes in is exquisite and even contains magnets to help keep everything closed. A glorious loss-leader(!?!?) of a product! 

The Therians are suitably weird: a sort of cross between Gieger's Aliens and The Borg from Star Trek coupled with a death-mask fetish. The Steel Troopers (UNA) are also have a strong aesthetic that seems anchored in a kind of Starship Troopers-meets-the-Tau.

The game system itself seems Warhammer-ish: Roll to hit/to hurt/to save modified by weapon/target chrome. There's also an interesting activation that incorporates card play and command points. All with D6s. We had an experienced GM and four players (including a young gamer who was probably 8 or 9) and the scenario (Hang in There!) moved very smoothly. Overall, it was fun but any longevity will depend on Rackham or game owners to come up with interesting scenarios for players to engage in. It's possible that this game could ultimately occupy the void that Space Hulk once filled.

There is also an advanced rulebook that offers a couple other factions to play with: Red Blok Troopers-- a socialist/collectivist force that has an interesting Social Realism meets Buck Rogers look. ...and the Planet of the Apes meets the Terminator Karmans-- a force of genetically-engineered primates. ...Heck, just look at the photos!

RATING: 5
Sci-Fi prepainted miniatures game.  I was not impressed with the 'base' rules the game shipped with.  Since it's a tabletop miniatures wargame, you'll be buying models, armybooks, rulebooks, etc to keep this one going.

The boxed game alone is ok, but I was unhappy that the full rulebook was not included in the boxed version as the rules included are stripped down.

Solid this bad boy for next to nothing.  The storage space I gained back means more to me than the game did!

Initiation set was a pretty lukewarm affair. I see many fair comments on how that turned out, was it a good idea? Regardless of the pros or cons it was certainly a cheap way to get an army started. I would have rated the starter set 6 maybe 7. First look at the advanced rules and extra releases has pushed this to an 8. This game will be big. As a side note Rackham has really learnt from the Hybrid release, much better support, translation, release timetable...everything. I'm very impressed.

This is very much like WH40K. I was hoping it would be like a science fiction version of Confrontation with painted minis, and the depth of play, but I was disappointed. Whenever I have to play AT-43, I wish I could be wearing a T-shirt which says, "I'd rather be playing WH40K".

Awesome! Very similar to the Starship Troopers miniatures game (except they are pre-painted figures) but the rules are certainly not as complicated. Dead easy to learn as the rules book gives you six scenarios to work thru with each one adding a little bit more of the rules. Fantastic!And as stated above, they are pre-painted! Also, it isnt collectable such as Star Wars miniatures so you wont have to spend hundreds of pounds - just buy the forces you want (of couse, after the inital set) and youre away.As a note I got mine from www.zonzab.co.uk, good price and quick delivery.

AT-43 is a great, fast, fun game... with pre-painted SF minis so you can play out of the box and everything looks good! So sad Rackham went under through no fault of theirs (so the story goes). Sigh.

Received the Initiation Box for free. Haven't played it yet. The pre-painted minis are really nice quality and the terrain is nice. The rules look simple enough but needed to be proof-read by an English speaker to pick up the grammar errors (mostly "a" vs "the").

RATING: 8
A very fast paced miniature game. The prepaints are excellent and the rules are fairly easy to learn. Scenario based play that takes about 2 hours or shorter for a game. Multiple plays in a single sit down are very likely and are a lot of fun. Just remember this, your units are going to get destroyed and destroyed fast! 

I have a decent sized Therian force. I have not played in a long time I'm thinking about selling it.

looks so good but it is probably going to become the next cash cow of expansion ad nauseum style. I'll wait.

Really must be a weak set of rules to be rating this low.

Expansions are almost as expensive as the base set. What a pity companies don't have the insight to go for smaller profits from more customers rather than gouging their own few loyal fans.
Latest news is that Rackam is in trouble. When you price yourself out of the market it is no surprise.

I am a big fan of this game system, but not of this specific starter set. In fact, this set was so frustrating I almost never moved on to the full rules. I'm glad I did, though, and have two huge forces -- Therians [microbadge=13472] and Karmans [microbadge=8865].

This was the first Rackham product to catch my eye, via the FFG quarterly catalogs.  Space Apes with Guns shouted coolness to me.  I couldn't justify the cost at the time however.  Fast-forward several years.... I took a gamble on Confrontation and was loving my luck.  And then, MiniatureMarket.com slashes AT-43 prices.... it was time.  From reading the free PDFs of the rules, I knew it shared lots of mechanics with Confrontation, so I knew it was a good bet this would be good as well.  My only concern was that it might be too similar.  

After getting the game and seeing it in action, though, that concern was dispelled.  While it shares many similarities, it is definitely a distinct game.  Not just in theme, the strategies are much different as well.  So, if you're a Sci-Fi geek, AT-43 is perfect.  If you're more fantasy-minded, go for Confrontation.  If you're a huge geek (like me) and love them both... get both!

RATING: 2
Operation Damocles is a fine beginning and probably the shortest, most well-thought through minatures rulebook I have seen in a long time. The basic rules take 5 minutes, with each scenario adding to the depth. By the end of it's 24 pages you've spent 3 or four hours and you're ready to fight with all the rules!

Among the pre-painted miniatures crowd this is level of quality is unprecedented! Many of us will be touching them up, but they are so well done, it is only my own vainty that compels me.

Follow-up play with the full ruleset and army books has led me to conclude that this game is not quite what I was hoping for. I like the universal table, but used as intended, the weapon ranges reward static game play.

The Therian LP routines allow for ridiculous abilities to be utilized and the UNA "medic" ability only intensifies the feeling that even during the design and playtesting it was quite appearant that something wasn't working.

I am not giving up on this game, but I am struggling to endorse the system.

the system continues to elude the fun factor. Whatever the reason, my affair with this game is nearly done.

The inconsistant fiction makes this even more pathetic, can't even try to fool myself into thinking this universe is cool...and the Karman previews going around are worse than the crap they showed in the main rulebook. Based on what I have sunk into AT-43, this is becoming my worst gaming debacle of all time. And I was so happy with it back in December 06...

that's it I'm done...this was heartbreaking.

For the player who loves detailed minis, but has neither the time, talent, nor patience to paint them, this game is for you.  I love the sculpts, and the combat is very intuitive.  Plays quickly and can be taught easily, just by running a few sample combats.  The game really shines in the objective games, with Victory Points and Reinforcement Points determining the winner.

Purchased during FFG's 2008 holiday sale.

Have played through most of the introductory scenarios. Nothing to write home about, but nothing terrible either. Not terribly complex with the base units - and now that they are probably going to get harder to find, is the game actually worth trying to track down any more?

The power sources and cargo boxes are really cool terrain though!

EDIT: Sold. I put it up for sale while pondering investing in more units. It sold quickly, so that must be a sign. I hope the buyer can play this game to its full potential!

The miniatures are nicely done and the sheer size of the box makes for impressive presentation.  However, the organization of the rules and the very limited options/unit differentiations in the starter box generated very little enthusiasm in our group on initial playing.

Had fun first few plays.  Not the deepest tactical game I've played, but probably deeper than any of the major miniatures systems I've tried.  It's enjoyable, and looking forward to future games.  Best pre-painted minis I've seen, especially the Karmans faction.  They look better than 90% of most people's self painted minis I've seen.  A bit pricey (to me), but on par with or less than un-built, un-painted lines from other makers.  I got in to this thanks to Fantasy Flight Games clearing out their inventory as they will no longer be the US distributor.  The War Store and Miniature Market (probably others) still have good stock on the clearanced units.

At this point, there isn't much to set this apart from every other minis game aside from the fact that you don't have to paint them and they look great. This is an excellent game for you if you would love to get into something like 40k, but don't want the whole hobby that goes along with it. Unfortunately, randomness, measuring, rules that add realism instead of fun, etc. all bring this down in my estimation. The most annoying thing is that you are forced to make strategic decisions before measuring. I thought this was a game of strategy not skill at estimating. Why not throw in a trivia question or two while you're at it? Nevertheless, the beauty and ease of getting into it make it worth a second look.

RATING: 7.5
Another promising system that nobody seems to play.  The miniatures, pre-painted, are amazing and of very good production quality.  The game uses an interchanging turn sequence rather than the IGOUGO side-vs-side, with each player activating two squads at a time then passing to his/her opponent.  There's a command-point type of system that allows you to execute limited additional orders each turn, including Overwatch, Double-time, etc.  All Unit and character stats are provided on cards for ease of reference.

Downside: it's a fairly limited range of armies and miniatures.  And since the game is sputtering, it doesn't look like the production schedule's going to ramp-up anytime soon.  A nice run at the 40K juggernaut, but not robust enough to compete in the field.

RATING: 5
Clean, simple mechanics and, thanks to the emphasis on scenario/campaign play, possesses a different feel than other squad level miniatures games. (Void, Warzone, Warhammer, etc.)  Players are encouraged to use combined arms and to mix up their forces for different missions.  Gameplay moves quickly and is very lethal - units don't survive long in combat.

The biggest weakness is probably the indirect fire rules - they work mechanically, but make indirect fire weapons too accurate.  However, it appears Rackham is changing these (eventually done as errata in one of the supplements).

The rules are a better translation than those used for Hybrid, but the question and answer process on Rackham's forums can be frustrating.  There is a tendency to shoot from the hip in giving answers and rulings are frequently contradictory to the basic game text.  Docked it a point for these issues.

Dropped it another point recently out of disgust with the poor quality of the scenarios.  Many of them are terribly balanced and not fun to play.

I've also become displeased with the way players rely on heroes as crutches during force selection.  This effect is common to many of these science fiction miniatures games, but it seems particularly prevalent with AT-43.  Some of the heroes are exceptionally powerful and (of course) show up game after game after game...

For players wondering about army size - we went with 2000 points, which for my UNA meant I fielded about 4 Fire Toads and maybe 40 infantry figures.  This is not an inexpensive game.

They have only been used a couple of times (due to lack of players) and are in better than new condition since I took the time to touch up the factory paint jobs, textured the bases and put a metal weight under the bases so they have some heft. I only have one box and rulebook, but everything else is complete.

A very pretty game that boils down to move and attack.  It might as well be on a grid, not very interesting tactically and resolving combat is pretty boring, as you chip away at the opponents squads and/or appendages.

I have Operation Damocles initiation set and haven't quite decided if the game "grabs" enough for me to really get into it.  The prepainted plastic miniatures aren't bad, but I don't think I can "bond" with them like my own painted lead guys.  The vehicles are really cool, though.  Nothing really to set it apart rules-wise, other than the occasional, charming "Racklish" turn of phrase.  Plays quickly.  My opinion might be higher if I explored the tactical possibilities of bigger games, but I am going to wait until someone else in my gaming group buys in before I invest any more in it.  (As an aside, I've been playing 5150 with the minis.)

The figs are pretty nice (great sculpts, ok paint job), and you get a pretty fair amount of stuff for what you pay (between figs, terrain, tape measure, dice, rules, etc.), but I'd have been happier if the REAL, full rules shipped with the game, and not the paltry introductory set.  I have to wonder just how much support is going to be available for this game, especially here in the U.S.

RATING: 8
Not a bad game but not great either.  I understand that this is only an introduciton and I cannot wait for the main rulebook.  The biggest issue I have is the terrible map that is included to play the scenarios in the rulebook.  The game cries out for using just the tabletop with terrain.

Update - played several games with the full rules and it is much better than the introductory set.  Streamlined but fun gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Editing, translations, distribution issues, and generally poor involvement in promoting the game by the new "corporate" heads of Rackham, this game is playable, affordable, and not a "black-hole" of cash and time involvement before the figs are on the game table.  New concepts in gaming and game design are apparent and make the game play fun and competitive.  While not contest quality, the pre-painted figs are excellent and when on the table and three feet away, the paint jobs look great.  If I were to include the problems mentioned in the first sentence, the rating would be lower, but this is a rating based on game play, not business politics.  Try it.

The Initiation Set is fun to play; though the english rules were hard to follow at times.  The introductory scenarios used to teach you the basic rules as you go is neat.

I'm rating the entire game here, not just the starter set. I think the painting on the miniatures is very serviceable, but the figures are certainly good enough that you could repaint them with excellent results. The different armies all play differently and you have a lot of options. The only complaint I have about the game is that the layouts of the rule books make building an army list more difficult than it needs to be. Most of my local players disagree with me, but this is my review. They can go write their own! :)

RATING: N/A
Skirmish with prepainted miniatures, using tape measure movement. Actually simpler than most CMGs; It just seems complex at first sight because you have to gather the rules from several different rule books.

The original 80 EUR price for the starter set was very steep, but since the current price is only half of that, or even lower, the game is worth checking out.

Based on the Initiation Set rules, this is a very simple skirmish game. Compared to CMGs, the Zone of Fire rule is an interesting addition, though. The complete rules are not much more complex, so there's no need to stick to the Initiation Set ruleset. Especially since the rulebook and army books are now downloadable on the official site. The new rules introduce action points, a nice damage system for vehicles, and indirect fire. The rest is just some special cases and exceptions which might be found in the expansion packs.

A huge amount of work has been spent on artwork and especially on the thematic backstory. Unfortunately, the effort spent on the ruleset is several orders of magnitude smaller, so there are quite a few omissions and ambiguities in the rules. The ruleset is not very original either. The thematic fluff is also dispersed all over the rulebooks, making them significantly thicker than needed, and not always very efficient to read. I'd prefer a much more concise and clear representation of just the rules, without the excessively verbose thematic explanations.

The combat strider miniatures look really neat. I thought some of the artwork looked familiar; The answer is simple: Davide Fabbri is among the illustrators and miniature designers.

The expansions are very expensive compared to the number and quality of their contents. First of all, there is very little variation in sculpts, and price per miniature is high. These seem to end up in sales every now and then, though.

Some comments about specific boxes:
- The map in the container pack is the same as in the starter set, and the containers do not lock onto each other in any way when stacked. Their hinges also break extremely easily, usually even before you get them out of their original box. 
- The tape measures are of low quality. 
- The token set is pretty useless: Instead of giving us some useful markers, half of the tokens are just action points. The total number of tokens is also low, so you'll probably need two or three sets of tokens.
- The Storm Golems included in the Operation Damocles box do not constitute a legal maximum size unit; They should have included one more special weapons dude in there.
- The Wing Troopers miniatures are very fragile.
- The Sgt. Borz and Capt. Newton hero boxes include the heroes' strider cards as well, but the Urash hero box does not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
 The game system is quite basic and efficient, but it ends up too much often in rolling a lot of dice for very random results. Not that much tactics in it. Nothing brilliant in the game design, though it doesn't have any decisive weakness neither. And the background of the game is just bland... USA and USSR fighting in an alternate future, with killer/wisemen gorillas and borg-like cyborgs... In the same style, VOR was much better IMHO. I'll wait to see if future factions catch my interest.

RATING: 6
Played a number of intro games with Therians & Karmens. Enjoyed the theme of the game and the prepainted models are nice but the overall strategy of the game seems limited. Played 3 games,switching back and forth between the two factions, and was able to win all 3 using the strategy of move, go on overwatch, wait for opponent to move, shoot. Maybe if objectives and specific scenarios were used it would open the game up to more strategy but I did not use those in my intro games. I did like the alternating activation and each of the games played was quick. This game seems like a light, disposable type of wargame. I had fun and might be up for another game but I wasn't impressed enough to actually invest in the game.

I should qualify the following review. I only got into this game after it was discontinued because of the extreme discounts my local store ran to clear off the remaining stock. I purchased armies for UNA, Cogs, Red Block and Karman, as well as the starter set... I thought if nothing else, they were awesome looking minis I got for very cheap.

For a miniatures game, I've enjoyed this game quite a bit. I've always had a soft spot for light tactical skirmish games and this one fits the bill. I don't know if all the armies are balanced, because I only own units that were left over on the shelf, but from what I have the matches have been pretty competitive. 

Unfortunately, as with any game that requires a tape measure, turns can be a little slow paced. Fortunately this one uses alternating actions (you move a figure/unit, I move a figure/unit) so there isn't a whole lot of downtime. I like the way that shooting naturally gets more difficult the further away you are, instead of having a static maximum range with an artificial long range modifier. I also like the fact that some weapons simply can't penetrate some armor no matter how well you roll. Your pistol isn't going to damage that tank, for instance- not even on a crit. 

I also like the pre-programmed nature of the turns. Similar to a game like Heroscape, you decide which order your units activate in the turn before the turn starts. There are ways of adjusting this during the turn, and there are tricks to allow you to manipulate the order of your opponent's turn.

Beyond the basic game, I like the fact that this game is about taking and controlling objectives on the board throughout the game instead of simply wiping out the opposing side- that really helps this game shine. There are plenty of tactical and strategic elements to consider throughout which are augmented by several special orders you can give to units and special powers introduced by the heroes. I think the "currency" of the game (leadership points) appears to be a little too generous, though- I rarely get close to spending it all even when buying everything available during a turn.

The best looking prepainted miniatures in the industry!

Now that I got that out of the way...This is the worst game ever created (and it hurts even more because Rackham created such beautiful models, which I I have a ton of and can't use for my enjoyment). I don't even know where to begin my disgust.  Ever wonder what would happen when you throw a group of monkeys into a sealed room with a typewriter? Shakespeare? Not quite...try AT-43!  

The "universal resolution table" is neat..if you like being able to throw a grenade across the board.  

The Therian army is where the game completely falls apart.  If you are smarter than a fifth grader, you should be able to quickly figure out statistically  how the Therians with their amazingly strong weapons, dominate the UNA point for point.  Combine this with the addition of extra Therian "routines" and you have an army that can sit back building vehicles , and then combining those vehicles into meaner, larger vehicles all for the introductory low price of...ZERO build points. or imagine shooting at a 400 point leader with your whole army just to destroy it, only to have it regenerate itself by taking over the body of a leader a tenth of its price cost? Then do it again the next turn (Oh FUN!).

Rackham obviously knew that they messed up with the Therian advantage, because the UNA has demigods...otherwise known as MEDICS!  Imagine shooting a basic UNA trooper with your Wraith Golgoth's medium nucleus cannon, a laser cannon so big and accurate that it hits automatically at most ranges and causes wounds automatically on all non-vehicle troops.  Now, try to imagine a medic sweeping up the ashes of the evaporated trooper, giving it a few drops of morphine, and then magically bringing the trooper back to life.  To make this even worse, you can have two medics in a squad and they can shoot normally after performing their miracles. Did I also mention that they can turn water into wine after the battle.

If the game play wasn't the worst, the fluff is a close second.  Rackham is launching a great number of stories in their books, magazines and e-mails...however there is no common theme.  Everytime I read a story about the Therians, their motives, ambitions and purpose change.  In some places they are a slow, calculating bureaucracy, but then in other stories they are able to adapt at the push of a button.  Then some times they are mentioned as having little knowledge or need for warfare, lacking a true warrior class, but in other stories they are completely obsessed with warfare and have battle arenas within their virtual world. The fluff gives you a headache with the constant contradictions and plot flaws.

My overall score for AT-43 is such: Miniatures: 10   Game: -10 = 0

Good fun and stunning looking miniatures game. The Damocles set offers scenarios that are playable in 30 minutes or less! Turns are fast and the basic rules are easy enough to grasp (although there's nothing particular new or innovative here): units either shoot and move, move and shoot or make an extended move.

This looks to be the future of miniatures game...prepainted miniatures at a fairly resonable price.

Game moves fast and is easy to pick up and learn.  The minis are a bit pricey, but if you skip the boxed set (which is not worth the $80 IMHO) and just pick a faction, it can lessen the blow.  Overall AT-43 is a great game to play, with tactics and strategy I was not expecting at first.

Trade comment:  Army starter-boxes for the Cogs (like to have) and Oni (must have), with their respective army books.  I might consider other AT-43 trades that don't involve monkeys (not a monkey fan!), but my Red Block, UNA, and Therian armies are all pretty beefy at this point, and I don't think I'd really want to be trading a game for a figure at this stage, since I tend to like fielding more units rather than big units.

RATING: 8
A very unique combat system.  There is a special tape measure you use to find "range."  Weapon accuracy minus range determines a number, that number is then referred to the "universal combat resolution table" (UCRT) and the table result is the to-hit number.  Then, if you have a successful roll, you have to determine if the shot penetrates.  Compare target armor ratings to shot penetration values, again, refer to the UCRT and roll the dice.  Then roll hit location.  So a little redundant, you have to roll three times for EVERY shot taken.  But the minis are AWESOME and movement is simple.  Although the "direct line of sight" is flawed (a taller unit can't shoot over a shorter unit) and some units are so "broken" that they are impossible to kill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Based on the introductory set, Rackham has produced a game for players who want cool-looking figures but who lack the time, skill or patience for assembly and painting. The basic troops look very good for pre-painted miniatures, but it was the two "walker" attack-bots - the Toad and Golgoth - that sold the set for me.The introductory rules are clear and easy-to-use, and the addition of online scenarios and expansion sets demonstrates Rackham has a solid commitment to this one. Gameplay is fast-skirmish style, with not too much complexity, but additional layers available once the full rules are posted online.Definitely one that shows a lot of promise.

43 Years After Trauma: AT-43.

[b]POSITIVE:[/b]

1. Fascinating set of smart miniature rules - has the bite of a Great White!
2. Brilliant futurist designs.
3. Cool aliens.
4. Great prepainted models.
5. Very cool mechs - in all factions. Just take a looksy at the UNA Fire Crawler, if you're unsure - it's bad-ass.
6. Hero characters - like Gaslight.
7. Fabulous stat-cards for every unit type.
8. Clever unit activition mechanism.
9. Fun death-dealing gameplay.
10. Brutal combat. Most soldiers are vaporised by the incoming weaponry. Ouch.
11. Objective based skirmishes. Obviously, you can just have two or more armies slug it out, but you can also layer in way-points and objectives to make things very juicy.
12. Below seems like a BIG list of gripes, but they're niggles and whines, really. Enjoy this game. Before Rackham go bust, and the units become ever more scarce.

[b]NEGATIVE:[/b]

1. Skewed English translation in all the rulebooks.
2. Requires multiple army books and separate rules to play.
3. Expensive to gather together armies. Hugely so, in some cases, but not as bad as Warhammer, I suppose. At the very least, they don't make older units redundant with power-creep or other issues.
4. Supply issues with certain models. Many models, actually. Try getting your mittens on Therian Assault Medusas and you'll see what I mean.
5. Requires additional componentry to play easily. e.g Overwatch, grounded, and kneeling tokens. You'll need, like, four baggies of these things from the independent supplier to have enough leadership tokens, for instance.
6. You may need to produce your own laundry list of memory joggers for the rules - to save time wasted in the heat of battle. Maybe you won't, but I do.
7. Some of the miniatures are very flimsily glued/constructed, and will need attention after purchase. Not a deal breaker, but worth considering. The Hekat Golgoth, for example, looks amazing but is attached to the base by the teeniest of claws. The Fire Crawler has two massive, Heavy Graser weapon systems, that fire beams of energy comparable to a satellite strike; but the guns are attached by toothpicks to the chassis!
8. The design of some mechs is definitely stunning beauty over practicality - a bit like Doira Baird (a woman any bloke would bang in a heartbeat, but probably's high maintenance).
9. This one pisses me off: A fair-sized section of the weapon-set utilises area effect damage resolution. So you need the official template. Okay. Do I get one of those in the Base game? No, of course you bloody don't. Money. Money. Money.

A huge factor in wether you really enjoy AT-43 is the quality and diversity of the terrain you have access to - much like any miniature wargame, I guess.

[i]COHESION HOUSE RULE:[/i]
It seems strange to me that the unit cohesion rules are so restricting regarding the placement of vehicles/striders, so I've amended them: All vehicles can be placed up to 6cm apart, rather than the 2.5cm for infantry. I just don't want a gaggle of mechs moving nose-to-nose through the ruins of some far-flung, smoke shrouded alien cityscape - give them some room to manoeuvre, for pity's sake!

RATING: N/A
Matthew and I just couldn't get into it at all. Damocles didn't offer enough to hold our interest and it would cost too much to build two usable armies. Traded it away.

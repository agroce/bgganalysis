Yet another simple abstract; this time with nice components. I can't get too excited about this. Passes the time nicely though.

Matagot team. I played a lot and still can learn new tricks. It's the only game my 5 years old daughter and my father can play with me in such a different way, from quick and fun to deep thinking.

RATING: 6.1
Initial rating, based on playing once. Lovely components, and reminds me quite a bit of TZAAR and DVONN, but the rules don't seem to work quite so well, and I prefer the tactile feel of those pieces over these plastic cappuccino cups, too.

RATING: 7
This game was really intriguing for me. It is simple and deep at the same time. Unfortunately, the main strategies are about 3 and when you and your opponent recognize all of them, well...the victory becomes a question of who starts the game. Still umpredictable in 4 players.

Ottimo gioco da esporre e giocare in poco tempo, cattura subito l'occhio e la curiosità se viene lasciato in tavola. Semplice e veloce gioco astratto molto divertente e ideale da giocare per il post cena per rimanere in tema. Inoltre un grande gioco adatto anche alla famiglia e simpatico per la sua componentistica.

Cappuccino is, to me, a game which needn't have been made. DVONN is in all ways imaginable the superior title (save, perhaps, physical appearance): the fact that separated islets still count for your score leads to a very destructive and one-sided way of playing the game. In DVONN, they are simply removed because only stacks connected to the red disc count, which is a far better approach. Of course Cappuccino adds support for 3 or 4 players, but this opens up the usual can of worms how they are going to attack each other. If two gang up on a third, the third loses. There is no starting player advantage compensation. Etcetera: it's all the basic pitfalls which do not get addressed. My conclusion is simply that the game is not meant to be taken all that seriously, and perhaps that is what author and publisher intended, too. It is then a fine game for the casual family player (after all, it's about coffee cups which you stack, what can be wrong or difficult about [i]that[/i]) but the grizzled abstracts player will probably pull out something different.

Cappuccino is somewhat reminiscent of Hey, That's My Fish, and shares its major problems: In multiplayer games it's mostly a question of who to gang up on, and for just two players there are games that do the same thing in a more polished package. Indeed, they might have tried a little too hard to keep things simple and coffee table-compatible. It looks quite cute, though.

Hey! That's My Fish! is brilliant. This game is not. The only similarity it has is in the hexagonal gameboard shrinking as the game progresses. 

In this game, whoever builds the biggest stacks (ie goes first) wins, if they pay even the scantest attention to board control. If you spend time making a decent sized stack, and someone has a bigger stack than you anywhere near you, your only recourse is to run away and try to cut them off somehow from eating your stack, else your efforts of many turns are wasted. With your running away, their stack grows bigger, and they have the advantage of maneuver. If you switch focus elsewhere, they eat your hard-earned stack whenever they want and can switch focus to match you elsewhere.  Just... ugh.

Yes, it is quick, but still not worth the time invested in playing, even with kids. Everyone's reaction was "Really? These are the rules of the game?"

RATING: 7
Great game for two players. Gets more random with more players, but still fun if played casually. When changing the number of players, somehow the feel of the game changes  similarly to how it does in Carcassonne.
Reminds me a bit of Hey! That's My Fish!, but I like Cappuccino better.

Essentially multiplayer Dvonn, where all moves are adjacent instead of jumping.

Easy to grasp abstract game and very quick to play filler.
Material is top which also leads to a high price for "just a filler".

Who thinks that [gameid=8203] is too complicated should try Cappuccino. The game is explained in four pictures. Ok for 10 minutes but a bit too simple and reduced for long-term enjoyment. I don't see an alternative to an early killer-stack strategy by uniting two of your own stacks. The winner will be able to repeat this once or twice in separate areas of the board. The components are outstanding though and warrant a rating increase!

Abstract game whereas the setup seems to be very important. Not sure if the game is actually deep or not. I enjoyed a bit.

感想：
1. 簡單易學，超好推坑
2. 互動性超高，每論變化很大，計劃要不斷修訂
3. 遊戲配件也是相當好
4. 快來快去的遊戲，但也有其策略性

15 minutes.  Pac-man style abstract strategy game.  Whoever consumes the most cups wins.

RATING: 6
How simple can a game be? How much can you abuse a theme, to make a game based on a very simple, non original, game mechanism?

And yet, Cappuccino has very nice cups, and is actually fun to play.

you could try this game at home with coffee cups :)

Really cool plastic rubbery cups in this game. It is a pretty fast and somewhat interesting abstract game. 4 player is too cut throat so I am thinking it will be better with fewer people. Didn't wow me and I knew the outcome too fast to care about the ending to the game. Not so interested in playing again.

This is not a game that was on my radar. It's an abstract game, and while I enjoy playing those every now and then, there are very few that I consider worth owning.
From the explanation, this game reminded me of [thing=8203][/thing]. You jump from tile tot tile, gaps appear and you can't jump over those so you can cut off other people - or yourself if that is beneficial.
I thought the game worked well, and there are some nifty strategies you can try to increase your chances of winning. But all in all it doesn't stand out for me. It's just not the kind of game that excites me. It's just a bit too one dimensional for that.

15min abstract for 2 to 4 players.

This game is better than the card game, and I love the introduction of dice to the battle system.  I still snicker at the bad jokes too.  My only beef is that it can become cumbersome and unwieldy.  I've only ever played two-player games, and the downtime was getting a little much for me then.  If it was six-player, then I think it would be way too much.  I wonder to what degree controlling the monsters of your colour would mitigate this, though.

Oh dear. It's like Munchkin made even worse. Maybe it's because I played it 6 player, maybe it's because I'd effectively lost after my opening hand it really didn't matter. This was just 4 hours of utter boredom with me literally helping someone else win so that the game would end. Please let me never have to play this ever again.

The game is good with two, with more people it gets too long and too chaotic and frankly speaking boring: it's obvious that everybody gang up on anybody who gets a little stronger. The humour is nice though. It's a good game to play while drinking and chatting with friends.

RATING: 7
I was very disappointed with this game. It fulfills its promise of making Munchkin an interactive board game very well and everything I like from Munchkin is preserved. Yet, there is a lot of rules and counters to keep track of, almost to an absurd degree. And the end game is just silly, requiring you to make level 10 and then go all the way back to the start and defeat a boss monster. Some of the game rules are broken as well. My first game ended in a stalemate, as my friend made it so that no one else could win the game and he himself lost.

It's got some cool concepts and a lot of great humor. You need 3 or 4 people to play it but playing with 3 or 4 people takes forever. If I wanted to spend 5 hours doing a dungeon crawl I would play Descent. Quality pieces though, right up there with FFG.

The game had potential but after a few plays we realized that not being able to stop the winner because you are in another part of the dungeon doesn't make the game better.  I think if you like the card game you should stick with it.  If you are looking for a Decent meets Munchkin game this is not it.

Played 6p with expansion(s?) and had fun. However...this game is quite the lengthy game. I don't actually like the dice-rolling aspect of the game, but would rather the game remain like the regular Munchkin. If I found it on a steep sale I'd get it, but wouldn't play it all that often.

Dungeon Crawler version of Munchkin. It's nice to have a more board game experience of Munchkin, but the play gets very long and can be a bit heavy at the end of the game. But the Munchkin essence is there, and has funny new mechanics.

got this on pre-order, and let me say I am looking forward to this game! also for the record, I LOVE munchkin so I was a natural for this one, more to come once I get my paws on it.

Ok, since the plays, and there are about three others I have missed, this game is AWESOME, it is a complete experience and is transcendent of its intended audience, it is loved by all who have played it, except one, and that one likes it enough to want a second shot, (admittedly not a board game player, all the "to do's" in the game tripped her up a bit) so she can concentrate on whats happening. IF you play games for money OR fun, this belongs in your collection. It can be had for MSRP or less depending on where you shop, just make sure to get a legit copy so SJ gets their due. Its worth the asking price, but if you can get it cheaper then kudos. Beg, borrow, or rent you MUST play this if you like munchkin and or fun at all!

Adjusted to a solid solid 9, I really like this game, I am not sure 100% that I will never tire of it, its the ONLY reason it came off the 10, still a high recommendation to me, great fun to be had!

RATING: 8
I don't get the hate on the munchkin series (maybe because of its popularity, maybe because it is basically the same game declined into 1 billion different versions...)... But I have to say I've never played the card game.

Now, as a rule of thumb, I don't like luck driven games (why the hell did I ever purchased Descent is beyond me), except in lighter games. This one can't be described as light because of its play time, but because of its theme I really don't mind the dice!

It's actually a fun experience that is most enjoyable starting from 3 players (although I've played it 2 players and it's fine, although it loses a bit of the social mechanics that make this game good: i.e., alliances, screwage, double crossing, etc.).

And the total absence of a dungeon master is a big + for me.

The game is indeed a bit too long.

I got this thinking it would be a light, fun adventure game. What a worthless pile of cardboard, ink, and plastic. This is just a cash grab on the part of the publisher; there is nothing different here than you would get playing the card game, which is a mindless beer and pretzels exercise that parodies traditional adventure games. This is a real disappointment. If you want a decent adventure game, rather than a Monopoly version of the card game, which is what it is, no more, no less, this will fill the bill. The production value of this game is way too high for what it is: a steaming pile of loose, wormy offal. The only one who's grabbing the treasure here is SJG.

Overly complicated for what it is.  Played with 3 players.  I was very hesitant because of all the negative reviews (and because it is Munchkin), but it was actually alright.  Exploring the dungeon is neat, as is building up your character, but it still has the same munchkin game end.

Just like "standard" Munchkin, but with a lot of time needed to prepare a gameboard and all small elements. It also makes it less interactive, because you often can't interfere with other players' battles. You can consider it if you want to play having 2 players only - then it's better than "cards only" version.

I'm not a big fan of Munchkin. I'm not a big fan of Talisman. I'm not a big fan of 'adventure' games where random events build your 'character' in order to get to some arbitary goal.

This combines all of these factors in a complicated, cardboard chit crazed, convoloted mess of a game.

Those who like those things I dislike will most definitely enjoy this game - it is simply not my cup of tea.

Only one play, and we never had a thorough rules reading, so take this with a grain of salt.  I'm not a huge Munchkin fan (the jokes are funny, at least the first few times, but the game drags on and on ...), but MQ seems to be something of an improvement.  The dungeon seems to both limit and enhance gameplay, and early play seems to move more quickly.  Still suffers from an interminable endgame, though, it seems.  I also wonder how much replayability it really has.  (For the record, I don't consider adding an expansion a suitable answer; if I have to keep buying stuff to make a game worth repeat plays, then the original isn't up to snuff, IMO.)

Kinda like the card game, but you effectively have to get to level 11 by beating a boss monster at the entrance. And you have to spend time walking around to find the monsters in the first place. And you might have other bad stuff happen to you just by walking around. All of which gives your opponents more time to get cards to make beating the boss harder and take longer. The 120 minute play time is extremely optimistic.

Munchkin as a boardgame is more engaging for me.  I feel it's a bit less haywire and I'm a bit more in control of the action.  Mind you, I said "a bit" ... PS: a friend bought a copy for us as a housewarming gift - thanks man!

I played it only once, but did not give it a chance to grow on me. Not a popular game in our house, it's like the tedium of playing monopoly paired with the player hate of playing munchkin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
House-rules for faster play:
1. you get 8 cards at the start, instead of just 6;
2. you can only "explore a room" ONCE per turn.
3. if they can move, the monsters only move up to 2 rooms per turn, max. (i.e. 3 if +1; 1 if -1);
4. in 3-player games, only 1 player can help the monster; in 4 player games, 2 players.

NB: the box is VERY badly designed: no compartments to store the components! Fortunately, I got it second-hand for an extremely good price, but if I hadn't I would have complained. For a game that retails at such a high price, this is completely unacceptable.

Offers so much more than the original cardgame, and makes for a fun little dungeon crawler with interesting movement mechanics underlying the monsters. Very glad I traded for it!

RATING: 6
Halfway between Munchkin and a full tabletop RPG. Takes approximately an hour to play per player. 

Deciding upon a house rule for monster movement before playing the game is recommended because it is possible to end up with all the monsters in the dungeon stuck in one room that every player then avoids. Needing to be in the same room or an adjacent room as other players really limits player interaction - which to some extent is the point of the Munchkin series.

The game tiles are a legitimate PITA to click together sometimes. Drives me nuts.

[b]Board Game Revolution - Birthday 2014[/b] 
The art in this game is amazing.  The dungeon crawl aspect is a lot of fun.  All of the Munchkin quirkiness is there, even the unique abilities in the rooms are great!  The only thing I would criticize about the game is when the monsters move many times nothing happens or the monsters all move in groups.  I'd like it if the monsters could more more...but it's all part of how the tiles are laid and the roll of the dice.

At first I though: "Awesome! Munchkin with a board must be epic!". I was wrong. Im not a huge fan of the original Munchkin although I really like the comedy and i do enjoy a session on occasion. Munchkin Quest is exactly the same as the original card game but takes the easy mechanics, the minimal downtime and the funfactor of the card game and throws it out the window. The excruciating downtime is perhaps the worst part. And its not because there are a lot of interesting descisions. There are actually less due to the fact that player interaction is more dificult. Essentially you do the same things as in the cardgame but with more complex rules and a playtime of atleast double the time. One play is enough. There is nothing in the game that can motivate why I would play this instead of the original Munchkin. A bad game in my book.

My feelings about this game have soured over time. Compared to the other games in my collection MQ is way too much of a luckfest, and unless the table is full of ruthless gamers it tends to cause a lot of butthurt feelings. It takes way too long to play with too much downtime between turns and there are few comeback mechanisms should one player get unlucky and fall far behind. It's not awful, and the modular board is a cool feature that tries to keep the game fresh, but I doubt this one sees the light of day moving forward.

I originally bought this game when I was just getting into board games. I still enjoyed Munchkin (probably because I didn't realize the other games out there) and I also loved descent. This seemed like the perfect mash up. Again, the game took way way longer than I thought it should, and in the end it had many of the problems that Munchkin has. Overall it felt like two hours over which everyone builds themselves up to have one epic fight. Then when they get to it everyone screws everyone until there is no more screwing to be had, and that person wins because everyone can't stop him. Completely arbitrary winners for a two hour game don't make me want to play it again.

I was very suprised to like this game. The cardgame didn't do it for me, but the addition of the maptiles really works for me. Now the 1489 Orcs are not just a card - they're blocking my way. And the big plutonic dragon is really scary, towering over my pathetic munchkin.

It's not a great game as it has some weaknesses: too much downtime & too long playing time for this kind of game. However, it's fun to play and that's the most important thing for me.

I like Munchkin very much and now Munchkin Quest makes the game even better. 
The production is great. There are high quality miniatures, cards, room tiles, tokens and cards with very- very beautiful colors.
The gameplay is quick and fun. Now M.Q. makes the game a great dungeon crawling. Using your imagination you could even create dungeon adventures with this system. Let's see how it will evolve.

Much like the card game...only on a board with a few other randomness in the rooms that are drawn.

Strategies are still basically the same.  Wait for someone to get to 9th level then crush them when you can...so the next person can win because you all dumped your power on the first.

Munchkin turned into a dungeon crawl.  Makes sense, and the bits look nice, apart from the monster standies which are way too small and out of scale with the rest of the game.   Still, it's too long and requires the right type (and mood) of players to be much fun after 45 minutes or so.  Turns can be surprisingly long, and the colored base concept for the monsters and the helpers are there to help the downtime issue, but it doesn't quite work.   If it were half as short it might be a little better.   You could house-rule some different level goal to shorten it, I suppose.

RATING: 6
One of the very first games in my collection, and the game which introduced me to modern board games. I distinctly remember the night a friend of mine organized a night literally just to play a single game of Munchkin Quest.

Despite fond memories and nostalgia, I can't say a lot positive about Munchkin Quest. Although I also can't say a lot negative. The zany Munchkin system that I've never found palatable seems more bearable when applied to a dungeon exploration, but I only ever come out the other side dissatisfied and unfulfilled, despite having had a couple laughs.

If you like Munchkin, you'll like this.  If you don't, this probably won't convince you.  You do have more control than in Munchkin, though.  Most of the time, you choose which monsters to fight.  It's longer than Munchkin, but you can play a shorter game by starting at level 5.  Gorgeous bits.

Take Munchkin, add a board and two dozen new rules for the dungeon, movement, and other heretofore irrelevant matters, and you have Munchkin Quest. I am going out on a limb here and suggest that people who really dig the card game will probaby also like the version with the board. Everyone else should beware.

The board primarily adds a couple of rules, lots of administrative fiddling around, and pretty much nothing in the way of gaming value. When even the card game is a winner... Blech!

Played for the first time. I really enjoyed it. However I found two things about it I wasn't keen on. First it feels that at every turn you get a DxM card. Secondly. The thief ability is actually very strong. My opponent hovered around the entrance way. Whenever I tried to win the game, he added his ability to the Level 20 monster. Meaning it now became around a Level 45-50 monster. It was crazy hard to win, and the game lasted a good hour or two longer then it should have.

I like the flavour and the game is fun, but overly complex.  I haven't played a game of Munchkin Quest where we haven't gotten at least one rule wrong (or forgotten altogether). Because it's convoluted rules, it doesn't get pulled out much, plus it's a shockingly long game.

Munchkin convertido en dungeon crawler de mesa "de verdad", con sus salas, sus pasillos y marcadores de posicion de los jugadores y los monstruos. En lineas generales es un buen juego y gana en profundidad con respecto al juego de cartas, pero por contra pierde la inmediatez de aquel con las "ayudas y puteos" (para lo bueno y para lo malo) y no es un juego tan completo y redondo como otros juegos del genero. 

Tendria que jugarlo al menos otra vez, que mi unica experiencia es una primera partida y encima incompleta.

Fun and somewhat nostalgic for players of the original Munchkin, however it seems to have a flaw in that if you start to do well, you'll pull ahead quickly without any of the other players being able to stop you. Once you pull ahead, you'll end up slaying 2-3 monsters per turn and the other players, not being able to take their turns yet, will have no way of stopping you. The rules definitely need to be tweaked a bit.

Munchkin Quest is an absolute blast to play. Whether an experienced dungeon crawler or just getting into the tabletop hobby, the game is appropriate for players of all skill levels. The flavor is wacky and meant to be hilarious, which adds to the low stress enjoyment of the game. The more competitive the players, the more the outcome of the game can be controlled. A simple, hack-and-slash game that I will never turn down... Munchkin Quest is damn near perfect in my eyes.

3D Munchkin provides the rooms and you then summon the monsters to go wandering through. The best part is that it adds bonuses/penalties depending on the room. The worst part is that it loses some of the spontaneity and fun of the source material.

As designed this stle of dungeon crawl in which you try to beat up on your neighbor does not appeal to me. The art for the monsters, rooms, and treasures are entertaining so I modified the rules to make it co-op to play with my kids. We had some fun and it played fast, but there was not much depth. We quickly accumulated armor and weapons which added to our attack strength, but there really was not much decision making. We still used the monster movement rules, but that seemed to add complexity without adding much value.

This is one of my favorites, but I made 2 rule changes.
1. Monsters don't move crazy, if they move to a new room, they move once and then stop, not all over the board randomly. And they can't move into the direction of a room not discovered yet (they don't loop around the board.) So much simplier this way.
2. The treasures are so pricy in this game compaired to the original card game, and then with the gold pieces you get in the game, I say you can only level up by turning in 2,000 gold instead of 1,000. You get more level ups by selling rather than fighting, now it is balanced.

   Also, some cards should be considered taking out of the deck for over powerment. This is one of the funnest games if you fix the few flaws.

Unnecessarily convoluted for what it is. If you aren't familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, then most of the jokes/references will fly far over your head. Even if you are familiar with D&D, this is not unlike regular Munchkin insofar as it grows very tired very quickly.

We've only attempted to play this once, but the rules are so convoluted that we spent the entire time trying to figure them out.  Finally we gave up on the game and played something else. 

If you're looking to play Munchkin, I'd recommend that you just play the card game.

RATING: 1
Among the worst games I've ever played. This game serves no one well - it's complex and tedious (forcing rules to be looked up in a poorly designed rulebook often) with virtually no meaningful strategic decisions. Cards have wildly variable strengths and, coupled with the randomness that permeates every facet of this game, there is little reason to believe one won or lost this game based on anything aside from sheer luck. This would be excusable if the game didn't have truly comical downtime -  on our first (and only) play 18 minutes per player's turn was the average. Maybe, with more plays, it would be possible to scale that down to 10. Are you willing to wait 30 minutes to anything meaningful, knowing your turn will just place you into a random encounter likely to be completely unscaled for you?

This game is too long, so long that it quits being fun after the first round or two.  All of the monsters still on the board somehow wind up in one huge, unbeatable mob.  Each player turn takes so long, in a game of 4 players each turn can take up to half an hour.  

Perhaps I need to find meaner people to play with, but by the end of my last game, we were all throwing negative cards on the boss monster so that the game would be over already.

Rulebook is very complicated. Every sentence has a line like "see page x". It feels like reading one of those "chose your own adventure" books.

RATING: 7.7
A munchkin for 2 player mode.
In my opinion not as good as original Munchkin.
The game may become boring when playing with 2 players, it's a bit better with 3 or 4 players, but still not as good as original Munchkin. There is more balancing problems and a bit strange winning condition (who killed the final monster, wins).
There is less roleplaying element.
And the last thing I don't really like idea with placing moster cards in holders - this wears monster cards a quite fast. So if there are 4 persons, I think I'd prefer original Munchkin and if there are 2 persons, I think it's better to find something more exciting to play.

RATING: 7
Kill the monster, grab the treasure, stab your buddy. That's what it's all about. Now, Munchkin comes to the boardgame.Cooperate with the whole group, adventure with a partner, or strike out on your own. You don't know what's behind a door until you open it . . . then another tile is added to the dungeon. Battle monsters for power and treasure, or send them after your friends. Reach Level 10, and then get out alive if you can!

This was one of the games I got on my first foray into this rediscovered hobby following Nuclear war. This choice was based on blind recommendations and my first experience of how bad those recommendations could be. From the reviews this sounded great - ok there were some dissenters but maybe they were wrong. There are always dissenters even on good games. They weren't wrong. I got this at the same time as the card game and I really should not have bothered. Dull lifeless lame jokes far too much effort for what was a joke anyway. Clearly the 'joke' was supposed to be on things like Descent but since that is awesome it falls flat.

While I feel that this game is much more balanced and entertaining than the typical Munchkin card games, the end game is still very much the same.

Нравится тем, что можно играть вдвоем=) Не сильно утомляет механикой и веселит своим юмором. Хорошо раскрыта механика поисков подземелий. Радует то, что монстры "могут охотится" за игроками и могут даже создавать целые банды. Юмор и атмосфера заставляют получать удовольствие от процесса. Даунтайм присутствует, но следить за игрой другого игрока интересно, весело, а иногда и полезно (можно сделать подлянку=)). Играется не быстро час - два.

This is the gamer's version of the Munchkin card game. Really turns it into the dungeon crawl feel, with the visual aspect of the board. Takes longer to play though. I like that that they made a board version; but my group most always seems to gravitate toward the card game version.

Preferred to Munchkin because the board enhances the experience. We play the variant where you can only explore one room per turn. IMO, that enforces the BEST strategy, which is to search rooms as much as possible. Free gold and treasures speed the game up by letting people buy levels and power up.

The first time we played this way, a 4 player game took exactly 90 minutes.

Fun and not that easy. Not very deep in terms of play decisions (not that I expected it to be). The may dynamic of the game is everyone ganging up on the player closest to winning. As a result it can run on a bit too long. Which means it's like Munchkin the card game... Love the humor, of course.

Gives more of a boardgame feel to dungeon exploring aspects vs the card game. Monsters may also move around from room to room. Adds some strategy elements because of the different room bonuses for race and class characters. My son enjoys it more than the card game at this point.

I'm not too keen on the practices of SJG, or on the cash-cowing of the Munchkin series, so I'm not a huge fan, to say the least. That being said, I felt, that just as with Monopoly, there's a valid place in my collection for at least one Munchkin game, so here we are. 

It is not a good game. The first few games drag because everyone constantly reads the cards. Later it speeds up a bit, but the jokes got old by then, and the underlaying system is not really a solid dungeon crawler. Despite all that, we still fancy it sometimes. Getting on the table sparingly, taking it as an activity instead of a boardgame, letting the silly flow, it's a decent backdrop to dicking around - for the right crowd. It works for us in this sense.

RATING: 4
Munchkin Quest adds a little extra to the typical Munchkin game, but definitely does nothing to improve upon the things I disliked from the original.  I enjoy being able to move my figurine around different rooms, which each provide different aids or hindrances, but otherwise it's the exact same Munchkin game that I get bored with every time I play.  The extras make it a little more appealing than the original, but still not enough that I would ever want to play it.

I've had several good games, most of the time with a set of friends and a set of drinks.  Best if players stay closer together (if people spread apart then game play can become stale as interaction drops of drastically).  While not complicated, there are quite a few things to keep track of (who gets a card and when, room symbols, monster movement rules, etc) which make it feel a bit heavier than the card version.  In the end, it can be a really fun game, but it can slow down to a crawl if players get bogged down in rules or spread out too much.

I am not sure why I even gave this game a 4.  I mean I really like these parts of the game:
  1) Takes forever to play while no real progress is being made.
  2) About halfway someone always gives up because it is boring.
  3) Each person's turn takes roughly 1/4 the span of the average human life.
  4) Being ahead means nothing because the first person to the final boss gets hammered with all kinds of ridiculous cards.
  5) The winner is ultimately determined by the person lucky enough to fight the final boss when everyone else's hands are depleted.

Edit: Why did I give this a four?  This should probably be below the epic duo of scotland yard and heimlich and co.

RATING: 3
Game ha-ha's don't hide the fact that this has serious gameplay problems. The game encourages exploration and fighting monsters. With luck you might do this 3 times a turn, and unfortunately this makes turns really long. It may have been 15 minutes before player 4 took his first turn on our first and only outing. The game's inherent randomness grants unfair favour and misfortune. A couple of easy monsters and you're suddenly levelled up, ready for harder stuff and you're snowballing along. Another player draws some big monsters, gets whacked with no rewards and they're lagging behind for the rest of the game. Ok, it's nothing but a ride game designed solely to help you celebrate the twists, turns and randomness of life. If that's what you're after, all yours. I prefer a bit more control and purpose to my gaming, even in ride games.

Munchkin meets a cardboard dungeon crawler. It plays pretty much the same as the card version, but it takes a bit longer. There are more rules for movement and the goal is to grow to level 10 and then escape on a final big boss fight. Turns take longer now, and the game can drag on forever. I give it a try and keep it because it still manages to be funny, and my son loves the franchise.

The game can be very fun, however it will take 2-3 times as long to play the board game compared to the card game. It can be hard to hold the interest of everyone for a full game.

Good board game, though some more complicated then the card game. It becomes very time consuming when playing it with more then 3 players or with inexperienced players. There is a allot of randomness, which makes it not a very good tactical/strategic game. You play it more for fun. 
If you love the game, you don't mind the time lost with it, though soms house rules (like monster movement 1 room) can make it allot more enjoyable.

It was fun, but I thought the end-game kinda dragged on. Adding a random element to fights is neat in the early game.

Honestly, this was Munchkin with annoying stuff tacked on in the end. And LESS player interactions since if you're not in the same room or close enough you can't participate in an other player's battle as much... What' the point?

Collected dust until used board game store opened.

Typical Munchkin game: Humor is there, but gameplay is pretty basic and bad. Maybe we got a rule wrong, but the monster movement lead to a big pack of 10 monsters being pretty much invincible. No need to play this again.

I think some people are a little hard on this game.  The main problem is it just doesn't have the fast pace of munchkin.  It's an interesting concept and a fairly good tile based adventure game, but if you really want to have an epic munchkin game, use the 'epic' munchkin rules.  Better yet, just ditch munchkin altogether, and play Betrayal at the House on the Hill.

RATING: 8.5
Nice alternative to the card game, with different mechanics, which make it something else.
French rules are globally ok - but I found some small errors or imprecisions that the English rules solve (i.e. the French version doesn't speak of moving between gaps and gives a wrong ending room number in the Unspeakingly Awful Indescriptible Horror example).
Looking at classical dungeon crawl games (Runequest, Descent), I would say that MQ is the best one - if one likes the parodic aspect of it.
I personally am looking first for fun and socializing when I play, so MQ is my prefered dungeon crawler.

[b]Learning Curve[/b]
Learning to play this one is really tough.  The rulebook was completely disorganized (I often had to search around for ages to find the info I needed).  Some of the rules were really confusing for us and some things are not explained well if at all.  I ended up needing to download player aids from BGG AND doing research after each game to write down additional info for things we didn't understand / couldn't find in the rules.

[b]Components[/b]
Good quality, everything present.  No complaints here.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Felt really really loooooong for what it is (even with 3 players).  Could be because we were bumbling around trying to figure out the rules?  Regardless, it seems unnecessarily complex.

[b]Rating[/b]
Giving this a lower score because it is so mindbogglingly long and confusing each time we played that getting people to play it is hard.  It might be a better game once we get used to the rules, but getting people to play it enough to do so is challenging.

RATING: 6
A nice boarded version of the original munchkin. We especially love monster movement and extra abilities. The biggest problem however is that when someone reaches the final level, the game sometimes keeps going on for another hour or so, and usually the person who reached the final level first wins anyways. Stopping him/her is fun in the original, and others can possibly win... but in Munchkin Quest it just makes the game longer, and even if someone else manages to win... it usually bores us, and we end up saying loud "finally"s when the game is over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
It's a complete anti-thesis of everything Munchkin. Munchkin was supposed to laugh about those long dungeon-crawlers, where you might die right at the start. And now it became one of them.
The cards are unoriginal, everything was taken from the card game version, the rules are unnecessarily convoluted, and because of that the downtime is horribly long. I play a lot of games where the downtime is an issue, however this is the first game where it is so boring. Nothing interesting happens to other players, and it still takes its sweet time.
This game killed the Munchkin franchise for me.

The weird thing is that it's not so bad - it's simple and take that element make this solitary dungeoncrawl genre a fun group activity. But the downtime and the overall length of the game are in the wft area (don't they design games better these days?). if time is what you have, its ok. 

The funny thing, it's actually more fun than another dungeoncrawl I own, MEQ (and that one is a 1/3 shorter but feels much longer).

A very fun game about exploring unknown dungeons and destroying your friends dreams of winning. I think this game can be very enjoyable with a close group of friends. People you're not buddy buddy with may get a little upset when you destroy all of their items, make them lose all of their gold, and drop them back down to level 1. 

Overall I think it's fun, but with the right group of people. The game takes much longer than just playing the Munchkin card game. I find that some house rules can help speed up play and make it more involved.

You will never play a more kooky and interesting dungeon explorer game.

Only played with two players, and I get the sense that it might play better with more people. It's an amusing game until the end, when it seems to drag as the players try to screw each other in the hopes they can keep their opponents from winning. Might be better as a true co-op. But, maybe with more people this mechanic feels different.

If they'd been able to make this essentially Munchkin with a map - eg, no conflicting rules - it might have been a better game. However, as it is, there are significant and subtle rules changes from Munchkin that make this game harder to play than it needs to be. If you never play Munchkin, this game may appeal to you more than it does to me, but I think the original card game was done much better.

It's easy to fall behind, easy to be terribly picked on, highly lucked based, etc, etc. But the game is one of those laugh at the bad luck of a player, or laugh at the silly cards types of games and it works great for that.

It's a good game and I'm sure we haven't plumbed it's depths yet; 4 players is a bit less than our average gaming groups. But it nicely structures the concept of Munchkin without restricting it too much.

After the first full playthrough I can say: Love the board mechanic. It takes munchkin to another level. There is generally a bit less messing with each other going on, but that's cool. I does however seem to take forever (or maybe we just need to get better at playing it)

This is stuck in the back these days, because it's still Munchkin.  It would be a lot more fun if it were cooperative, as the system is pretty solid...but the competitiveness of it makes it such that the only real way to win is to team up with someone else.  It's too long for what it is.

Kill the monster, grab the treasure, stab your buddy. That's what it's all about. Now, Munchkin comes to the boardgame.

Cooperate with the whole group, adventure with a partner, or strike out on your own. You don't know what's behind a door until you open it . . . then another tile is added to the dungeon. Battle monsters for power and treasure, or send them after your friends. Reach Level 10, and then get out alive if you can!

I really, really wanted to like this game. I love dungeon crawls, character advancement and variable powers. Ultimately though the downtime and "gang up on the leader to prevent the end of the game" syndrome was too much. 

We played a 2.5 hour game that I won but in that 2.5 hours nobody had over two turns. (We all had exactly two I think) That means we all took 15+ minutes for our turn which meant you waited over 45 minutes between turns. YOUCH.

Ωστοσο υπαρχουν καποια σοβαρα μειονεκτηματα οπως οτι περιμενεις πολυ ωρα για να ερθει ο γυρος σου κ οτι σε καθε γυρο
ανεβαινεις πολυ γρηγορα σε επιπεδο και χανεις τη ροη του παιχνιδιου.Ετσι οπως παιχτηκε η παρτιδα χθες δεν εχουν αδικο οι επικριτες του munchkin που λενε οτι ενας υπολογιστης μπορει να παιξει το παινχιδι και αν βαγλει το αποτελεσμα αφου δεν υπηρχε πουθενα υποστηριξη κλπ.

Για μενα το παιχνιδι 
στον 1ο γυρο ηταν 10
στο 2ο (αφου περιμενα 15 λεπτα για να απιξω χωρις να εχω καποαι συμμετοχη παρτιδα 4 παικτων) 7
στον 3ο 5
και στον 4ο 2-3

κοιωςσ ξεκινησε με τις καλυτερες προοπτικες και με ξενερωσε απιστευτα..απλα συνεχιζα να παιζω για να μη χαλασει η παρτιδα στους αλλους...

My 8-year-old loved this.  It's too long with more than 3 players (and almost too long with 3), but it plays in about 45 minutes with me and my son which is just about right.  Wacky fun, clearly, but much better than Munchkin and covers the same theme.

I like this. The rules are pretty simple, the jokes acceptably funny - but essentially it's a dungeon crawler like any other, just one that doesn't take itself as seriously as the others. And the card play aspect makes it far more variable than any other!

The rulebook for this one is world-class confusing. Man does it have a terribly written rulebook. Once we finally figured it out, turns started to roll out much quicker and I started to see what they author was going for here. Not too bad - however it IS a classic case of "more rules ...does not equal better". Good: does feel much more like a classic RPG as you build your character & explore. More strategy than Munchkin the card game. Bad: Too many steps to remember each turn. Too many 'exceptions to the rule' to memorize. Too long of a turn for each person. With a few small house rules, there's a good, possibly great game here. As is, it only really works with a audience that's a fan of the genre.

Para echarte unas risas. La pega es que es un poco/bastante largo

Game is not bad, but the rules are unclear and the game takes a long time to play.  I prefer regular Munchkin.

+ Hilarious graphic
+ Usual crazy card text and puns

- Setup is atrociously long
- It lacks all the "quickness" of Munchkin
- Interlock of tiles is weak and breaks
- Mob movement is not logical
- Too many weird rules
- Takes too long to finish

Munchkin with a board and much more fiddily. Not a big Munchkin fan this game just got really old really quick. Too much down time, rule changes from regular Munchkin were often buried in instruction manual. No clear order of play and some terminology and symbols explained poorly or not at all. Painfully long. Its just Munchkin with very nice bits. Can already see several how they can add several over-priced expansions for this as well as how they could re-theme it again and again and again, Another major, dull, cash cow for SJG.

This game is just bad. After the first play we give it another try and it was still horrible.

I could see this being fun. However, its usually the wife and I so it doesn't get played. Also a bit longer time to play then I care for.

It's a lot more than the Munchkin card game, many say too much more. True, a lot of things are happening, a bit too many things, but I still like it. It's nice bits, interesting things happening and it's a good game to have around.

Вроде бы ролевая игра, но кончается довольно быстро - всё хаотично.

Played a small game. MUCH quicker than OOTS and more fulfilling. The components are excellent.

Ultimately, I don't find this sort of game fulfilling. YMMV.

Munchkin with unnecessary extra bits.  Some new mechanics are introduced, but it retains all of the problems of the original game, with an even larger amount of downtime.

Aventurate descubriendo piezas en las cuales puede haber tesoros que te ayudarán a subir de nivel. Sin embargo cada pieza contiene un mounstro. Si es pequeño no te confies ya que tus adversarios podrán potenciarlo.

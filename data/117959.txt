130929 Kind of falls flat for me now.  I live in Vegas and I don't mind having a few simple dice fillers so I'm keeping it, but I'd go to Zombie Dice first.

120909 Cute dice game with simple rules and a fun pasted on theme.  Not sure if the neutral dice add ALL that much to the game, but they don't detract either.  Definitely does work nicely 2-5, and I don't see why it wouldn't work 6P with more dice.

RATING: 7
I love dice and dice love me. If you're like me, then Las Vegas could be a game for you. The reason why I am not giving a higher rating is that, the game just does not have enough meat in it to justify anything higher than a seven. But in its own niche of dice heavy, fast and light push your luck games it is excellent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light fun dice game with an interesting take on area control. You spend game rounds trying to take over 1-6 casinos by assigning dice from your pool of eight after rolling each turn. Each casino pays out a determined amount to at least one player with majority and possibly more depending on the flop (which is public knowledge). The game is simple, quick, and addictive. Like actual gambling!

It's a nice filler. There's strategy, but it's partly luck-based because of the dice. With a bunch of people, the turns are slower, but it can be fun if everyone is talking and if someone says they don't want a particular roll and then get it. Still, fun.

RATING: 7
This rating has a huge caveat. Based on one play, I see a lot of potential. The blocky ability of the 5th player, the subtle area control mitigated by risk

This is not a super deep game, nor will you feel like the game was epic at the end, but the game is the right length for what it is, and doesn't overstay it's welcome. With proper expectations, its a great game.

Nice party game using dice. Super easy to teach and play. On your turn you roll your dice and then you select a number and move all your dice of that number to the appropriate casino. At the end of the round the player who has the most dice on each casino takes the money. The rule that makes the game interesting and fun is that if you are tied then your dice are ignored. I like the optional rule about using 2 neutral white dice per player. Makes the game more cutthroat.

Simple dice game, with simple rules that manages to feel fun with reasonably interesting decisions.  I like this game as a mellow filler, or even something to play with non-gamers; it might even be my favorite "just roll dice" game out there, so tempted to give it an 8 rather than a 7. Played with the expansion white dice, and clearly, they do make things more interesting.

A simple and easy dice game. You roll dice to try and gain control in a casino to win the money there. Roll your dice ... allocate as many dice of the same number to a casino ... next player ... at the end of a round if you have the most dice at the casino you get the money ... most money wins. Simple but fiendishly fun. Thank you Chaz Marler of Pair of Dice : Paradise. I don't think we would have given this one a second thought if you hadn't talked about in on Board Game Breakfast.

RATING: 8.5
Very easy to teach and to play dice push your luck game to get the best jack pot.
This game is very light and would probably count for real gamers only as a filler game out of many others, possibly better, dice games.
However something seems to be special with this game. At least for non-gamers or so-called family gamers it must have some hidden magic inside.
I am sure that this magic is not to see on the outside of the box. Because based on the cover picture I would have never bought this game.
When I played Las Vegas the first time with my gaming buddies I thought "oh no, not again another Yatzee...", however we really enjoyed the game.
Especially with the neutral player's white dice you can get some interesting situations. At the begin we all tried only to minimize the gain of the other real players and lost our focus what the neutral player was getting at the end. After we lost some games against him we named the neutral player Mister-X laugh.
Clearly the neutral dice for Mister-X are a must variant and should always applied for all number of players (if needed borrow neutral dice from another game).
I was completely surprised how well this game resonates with my non-gaming families.
From the age of 8 to the age of 85 everybody really enjoined it and we played it until the late night.
So behind the simplicity and the large dice driven luck-factor something must be hidden in this game, which let the bell rings in non-gamers who normally avoid to join a board game.
This game-friendly effect alone is a good reason for me to keep the game on long terms. 
A good description of this game is to find here: [geekurl=/article/12171404#12171404] Las Vegas[/geekurl]

I gave it already 2 times as Xmas present.

\_______GER_______/
Das Spiel stand bestimmt nicht oben auf meiner Wunschliste. Ein simples W√ºrfelspiel auf Yatzee-Basis, was soll das denn sein? Und das Bild auf der Verpackung h√§tte mich wahrscheinlich vollkommen abgeschreckt. Aber als ich es dann bei Frank ein paar mal gespielt hatte, musste ich es einfach auch haben; aber Ende 2012 war es f√ºr l√§ngere Zeit erst einmal √ºberall ausverkauft :-(
Den Kauf habe ich bestimmt nicht bereut! Auch ausgesprochene Nichtspieler in der Familie (sprich: "Spielemuffel!") spielen es sofort mit und fragen selbst darum, noch mal eben eine Runde zu zocken. Dabei ist ein W√ºrfelbrett und einige W√ºrfelbecher eine gute die Las Vegas Atmosph√§re noch weiter zu erh√∂hen.
Ich habe das Spiel schon den eigenen Eltern und auch den  Schwiegereltern geschenkt und damit bei beiden Familien wohl voll ins Schwarze getroffen. Soviel haben wir bisher noch nichts spielen k√∂nnen, was aus dem traditionellen Spielerahmen gefallen w√§re; wie z.B. Skat, Rommee oder Mau-Mau.
Die "Regeln" sind sehr schnell erkl√§rt oder noch einfacher demonstriert. Der Aufbau ist noch schneller erledigt. Vor allem wenn der Mister X mit seinen wei√üen W√ºrfeln mit spielt (gemeinsam gegeneinander gespielt von den Mitspielern) ergeben sich schon spannende und lustige Situationen. Man kann zwar statistische √úberlegungen treffen aber am Ende muss man sich doch dem W√ºrfelgl√ºck sowie der Schadenfreude seiner Mitspieler ergeben. Umso mehr macht es dann Spa√ü, wenn die eigenen "Pl√§ne", jedenfalls zum Teil, doch aufgehen und die hohen Absichten der Mitzocker beim Legen der letzten W√ºrfel am Ende noch durch einen Gleichstand zu Nichte gemacht werden :-)
Wirklich ein Spiel f√ºr die ganze (Nichtspieler) Familie: mit viel Spa√ü gespielt von 8 bis 85 Jahre! 
Schon 2 mal verschenkt.

As medium filler-type dice game goes, I don't think it gets much better than this.  6 planks, numbered 1-6.  Deal out money ranging from 10k-90k onto each plank until at least 50k is present.  Roll 8 dice.  Put at least 1 matching die to its number.  Next player.  Most dice gets biggest money, next gets next, etc.  WRINKLE: ties are totally removed, so 3/3/2/2/1 means 1 gets tops and nobody else gets anything.  Simple, solid.

Las Vegas is a strange beast: it is a very light and luck-driven game for being part of the Alea series, and it is also an unusual design for herr Dorn.
BUT... I must admit I had lots of fun playing it!
The way majorities are scored is both simple and elegant, there's absolutely no chrome but the very essence of a game, with all the excitement of dice rolling, without much commitment for the brain. It is enjoyable as a fresh drink in a hot summer day...

RATING: 6.5
A fast filler game and probably one of the better gateway games especially to new board gamers. The variant where you get a 2 dice of a different color works out to be great.

A game that uses a simple concept where draws leads to ousting from the leader board works well in this game. To me this is a very elegant game with just the right time span.

Initial Impression: This is a fun, light, quick flowing dice game. It doesn't feel much like gambling though so I'm not sure the theme connects very well with the mechanisms. Still, the rules are simple to teach and a game can be played in under 30 minutes which makes this a nice filler game.

I must have been feeling delirious when I agreed to play this as an end of evening finale. Roll way too many dice, decide which dice (die) to place on one of 6 tiles that have random money allocations next to them. Player with most at the end of a round gets first pick, rinse and repeat.

It is self evident that the dice decide where they are put and this can fall in your lap or trip you up. Large values of money are decided on the last die roll. If you get excited by rolling dice then get this, otherwise there is no skill beyond averaging odds. IMHO a childs game that was obviously never going to be liked by me. Scored a 3 and not a 2 because it was over mercifully quickly.

I would need to be labotomised to want to play this again.

Yes, sometimes you can get absolutely screwed by the dice and the game is VERY luck heavy. But that being said, there are some neat decisions to be made. Will you spread out over many casinos, or fight hard for one? Take the safe bet at a casino with more bills, or take your chances at a casino with a single large bill? Take the lead, or tie someone to screw them out of some money? Fun filler for a crowd who likes the excitement of dice rolls and doesn't mind sacrificing complexity for something quick and fun.

Roll dice and put some on a mat. Those are your choices in this game and you need to determine if you should push your luck on one number or block someone out of another. The fact that players tied on a number cancel each other out, meaning that 3rd or 4th place could win somewhere is sort of interesting. In the end though, it's still a massive amount of luck and there isn't much here that I can get excited about.

The only thing in a game I love more than dice is a bucket of dice: and Las Vegas comes very close to the latter, especially when playing with the white dice variant: so I expected I could enjoy it due to its reliance on rolls and luck only. Sadly I didn‚Äôt. [i](June 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Las Vegas stands in the twilight zone between an overgrown filler and a light game: it‚Äôs a bit too long for a filler and it‚Äôs kind of too shallow for a proper game, however light or family-friendly it is. Anyhow, despite some opposition on my side at first, now I take Las Vegas for what it is: a light-hearted game that never lets you down.

As such, in April 2016 I raised my rating from 4 to 7.

A neat filler.  While there is nothing new here, this is a nice dice rolling game.  It kind of has that "Can't Stop" vibe, and while at this point I still like Can't Stop better, this is one I would like to start adding expansions too and explore more.

RATING: 9
Awesome filler!  It's so simple and I believe it can be played with six people, too.  Roll dice, place one number and try to get the most dice in that number.  Beware of tying someone or look to jump in somewhere where it seems like a tie is inevitable.  It's quick, the components are really nice. For me, it is similar to other games like Pickomino but shorter.  Some good, tough decisions.  But remember, it's dice.

Update: Played it two player with the rules of adding a neutral color of dice.  Frickin cool!

June 2012 - up to 8.5 as this is a great filler.  Played decent with six (added extra set of dice).  

August 2013 - a 9 now.

- a fast and fun area control dice game. Plays well at different player counts thanks to the bot dice which can block other players. Easy to learn and only a few components. All money cards sleeved.

Not a bad game, even with two players it was fun with using the neutral dice to try and take away the winnings of the other player.  While the game does lack some kind of excitement beyond what you roll, it is still a solid game that is fun to play and easy to teach.

Las Vegas is a great game to play with non-gamers. It's easy to teach, has enough luck that a new player won't get crushed, and yet has a nice twist with the ties-get-nothing mechanic.

My complaints are that the artwork is a little bland and it seems overpriced for what you get in the box.

Solid gateway-weight game that I don't see leaving my collection anytime soon.

Decent, quick dice game. With two players, the white dice are required to make the game even remotely interesting. After a few plays, choices start to seem pretty obvious, but the random money setup does change the board from game to game. Not my favorite, but a good game. Great iOS app.

A bit too simple, and a bit boring.  I didn't play with the advanced rules, so I'd certainly revisit it.  Especially because it takes like 10 minutes to play.

Many people are going to be disappointed by this game, as it is the lightest Alea series game ever made.  However, if you enjoy dice rolling fillers, I think this will be a really good little game for you.

There are 6 casinos, number 1-6, each with some money to be earned.  On your turn, simply roll your dice, pick a number that you rolled, and put all of that number you rolled onto the matching numbered casino.  Repeat this process until all players have placed all of their dice.

Then, check all casinos to see if any players placed the same number of dice on a casino.  If so, remove these dice!  Then whoever has the most dice on a casino gets the largest available money card, whoever has the second most dice gets the second largest money card, and so on.  Some casinos will only have one available money card, and some might have multiple cards.

That's really all there is to it!  Play a few rounds and see who has the most money when it's over.  Simple, but fun little dice rolling filler!

RATING: 4
Far too few choices leads to a lot of frustration considering the length of the game. Would be great if it player in under five minutes. What's especially painful is getting hurt by a roll that another player wishes they didn't make. But, you know, dice, what are you going to do?

The variant adds choices, but also time, because people now have to think a bit more on their turns. The choices might make the game deeper (and I'm not even sure of this, since so many turns have as a choice, cake or death, while other turns have a choice of gut or head), but not nearly deep enough to justify the extra time it takes now to play.

The game particularly suffers as a two player game as, being zero sum, the choices are most often trivial.

I will probably only play this game if it includes some of the modules from the expansion, as the base game is just way too, well, basic. See my comment for the expansion as well.

Now, the game itself - with or without the expansion - is extremely random, so it's not something I would usually enjoy, but the games I've played so far have been enjoyable due to the banter and yelling and cursing when bad luck strikes! So the game needs points for being, well, fun to play, but it's still too random to be a game I'm willing to play often.

Got to go into this one knowing that there is going to be some frustrating dice rolls because there are a lot of dice.

It can be lots of fun played in the right environment, and that's in a lighter environment.

I was actually interested in picking this up for the lunch crew. But after one round I was very unimpressed. Dice placement felt slow and plodding without much tension in choice. And it seemed players could just get screwed by poor luck. 

Part of the problem was that we played with five. This might work better at smaller player counts. But I'm not eager to find out.

Great Light Area Majority game for the whole family.  The removal of all tied dice really makes the game better than the sum of its parts.  We have played with 6 year olds who grasp the strategy well enough the make an impact.  We ALWAYS play with the neutral dice, and bought two extra colors to play up to 7 (use $70,000 per casino).

Make no mistake, this is not a decision packed game, but it is filled with those moments when all the spectators cheer the underdogs improbable win or groan when the underdog knocks themselves out by rolling that last die to tie the count.

For an alea game, even the medium-light weight house that the alea label has become, this is very simplistic. Players have 8 standard dice. They roll those dice, and then they have to choose one of the rolled numbers. All of the dice they have with those numbers move onto the corresponding tile. Said tiles each previously had money cards dealt next to them from a deck of cars that ranges from 10-90K inclusive and must have at least 50K in value. At the end of the round most dice gets the highest ranked money card, 2nd gets second money card (if applicable) and so on. Ties are bloody, as any tie results in the players pulling their dice back the remaining parties collecting the score. With 4 or less you can play with a variant where players get 2 neutral colored dice to screw with areas that they are not directly involved in.

Basically this is a game that relies somewhat on timing and a lot on rolling what you need, when you need it. You can sit and place out singletons all day to try and be playing last, but then, there you are, living the dream, and you roll a set of 3 for a number you can't win anything in. Or someone else rolls a nightmare set like that and you both get knocked out with the 3rd place player collecting the big score.

None of this is to say that it really bothers me, because this is a light, short, and fast playing game with some dramatic moments. It also has the decided virtue of being over very quick. But it really doesn't fit what I think of as the alea mold either. I'm pretty indifferent but probably will get a few more plays before I render final judgment as it fits the type of stuff that I can get to in our monthly couples gaming night. The neutral dice variant where each player gets 2 additional dice of a neutral color seems necessary to create interest, which means that without the expansion this is a 4 player only game unless you add more dice to the box.

A simple game of rolling dice and placing them in a semi-smart way in order to secure money with which you win the game. There really is little strategy to Vegas, and what little there is, ought to be familiar in under five games or so. It's a quick little filler which should appeal to the entire family. I'm sure to play it more than I feel is justified in the future when I'd rather play a filler like Piece o'Cake instead... But unfortunately dice rolling is simply more attractive to many than a thinky I divide-you choose mechanic. The suggested variant adds a bit of minor strategy, but not sufficient amounts by a long shot in order to make it interesting for serious play. The general appeal of Vegas leads to the rate of a '5', but it is only with the slimmest of margins that the game attains that value.

I'd originally played this on the app, and liked it well enough that I asked to get the tabletop version, and my BGG Santa kindly obliged. I'm pleased to say it's even better in person.

What I like about this game is the simplicity - roll the dice, assess your risk, make your choice, pass the turn. A round is over in no time at all, but much cheering, booing, and gnashing of teeth happens in the interim.

If you and  your family like fast, simple fun that still feels like you need to use your brain, this is a winner for you.

RATING: 6
Players roll 8 dice (and possibly some neutral dice if less than five players), and place all dice of one result onto the casino matching that result.   Repeat in turn order with remaining dice, until all dice are on casinos, and pay out winnings.  Cash notes are paid out to the most dice at that casino, but if there is a tie for most dice, they don't count, and next in line steps up!  Simple, fast, nasty and rather fun.  The game is much better with the neutral dice included.  This feels very much like a Knizia dice game... just a little something extra under the hood.

RATING: 5
Spectacularly light dice game that families and non-gamers can easily play and enjoy.    The whole game hinges on the rule that tied quantities of dice are removed, adding just a bit of spice to the area control element.  Without that, this almost wouldn't be a game.   In fact, it still might not be.   But, then again, it succeeds as a filler for families, etc.   Easy in, easy out.

Variants with white/purple NPC dice and "fat" dice (doubles) are a nice addition to spice it up without any significant additional overhead.

I love dice games and what usually makes them fall short is they demand simple rules which often comes at a cost of interaction between players. With this game you have to interact with each other. It is a game where once player play a few turn it clicks and is a blast. So I love the intuitive nature of the game, the simplicity and all out fun.

[b][FirstPlayOn19thMay2014][/b] I very much looking forward for this game. We played two 3-player games and both didn't excite me. I've heard about the dummy dice variant that improves the playing experience. We're definitely on it the next time we try the game. I enjoyed playing Alea Iacta Est and a fan of Rudiger Dorn's designs. I really hope Las Vegas proves to be a keeper after we tried it with more players.

2014-11-03 : 4-turn game that's explained in 2 minutes and can be played in 15. It's a dice game of course, so you need a bit of luck, but I found that every turn I had to make a couple of interesting decisions which is not bad for such a quick filler game.
2016-03-11 : The more I play it, the more I like the subtleties in the decision making process. Everybody is also engaged all the time, smiles and curses a plenty, so I'm upgrading this from a 6 to an 8
2016-05-13 : The first time we play this with 5 reveals that this removes the extra tactical layer of the white dice and hence isn't as good as a 4-player game
2016-11-27 : This game keeps on surprising me. There were 7 of us and somebody suggested this game - a few extra dice-sets were located and the casino minimum was raised to 80.000. I thought (and said) that it would devolve into chaos and an utter luck-fest, but it did not. It actually worked surprisingly well.
2018-01-07 : Another magic game of this, where the statistically most unlikely stuff kept happening. We laughed so hard we got weird looks from the other tables because we were supposed to be the serious hardcore heavy euro-gaming table. Just a perfect evening closer.

One word: addictive. The version with the neutral dice is brilliant and often leads to very critical decisions.

Excellent score the most points dice allocation game. The simple mechanics of how money is distributed, effects of ties, and placement of dice make for some interesting strategic decisions that encourage player interaction. although somewhat 'take that' but not too mean.

Never play this without the neutal variant, it is the only thing that makes this more than a Yahtzee variant.

I know it's a lite game, but I was expecting more from it.  Perhaps this is a game, not for gamers, but for my family at holiday's?

Overall, it is a lite, filler.  Our game with 4 took around 30 minutes, which is longer than I expected.  No real strategy.  Harmless game that replaces Yahtzee or its ilk.

While I didn't expect it to be a top game, I had expected a bit more of it to be honest. As it is, the four rounds play very similar, apart from the different amounts next to each casino. It would be more interesting if somehow you could already anticipate future rounds (by leftover dice & notes), though one can of course always invent variations to create such kind of gameplay.

At this point this is a real classic of luck and positioning. Easy enough for anyone to pick up, but enough choices and excitement to make it good. Many many times something will be decided by the last roll of the dice when you have no choice about where to put them, but it's fun and fast.

Alea is either brave or stupid releasing such a light game with their brand on it. 
If I consider it an easy gatewaygame or filler, then a 6 rating is ok. If I put in perspektive of the reputation of Aleas brand for gamers, then it would get a 3.

What an excellent filler! Las Vegas has a simple rule set and interesting choices. 
First you deal the bills to each casino until you reach 50k. This is a clever way to make sure there's always money in each casino and to create a ladder of possible rewards. A casino that only has a 90k bill can be profitable but very risky.
On your turn you roll all your dice, pick every die with a single number and place them all in the respective casino. Then the next player goes.
Once every player has placed all their dice, we see who won! The player with the most dice in a casino gets the biggest bill. Very important: ties cancel each other out!
Simple, quick and lots of exciting choices, I wouldn't change a thing.

Played this one with my wife's parents who hardly speak any English. This was a great game for that scenario (which was why I purchased it) because the rules were so short that they could be easily translated by my wife. There are harder decisions in this game than you would imagine and everybody had fun.

RATING: 6
Vegas is a moderately enjoyable dicefest, somewhere between [thing=41][/thing] and [thing=2243][/thing]. Everyone has dice to roll, and as you accumulate a particular number, you put those on a casino to reap the reward. Whoever has the most of that number wins, but ties cancel each other out. There's some strategy to picking your battles, but you're still always at the whims of fortune when dealing with dice. It's a fun enough filler, but not something that really grabbed me.

I enjoy it.  My one play didn't seem to go over too well with group that I played it with, but with the right crowd could be more fun.

05/31/17 Edit- Have played a few times since and it has gone over well.  I have upgraded my dice; I bought slightly bigger dice in six colors so up to six can play, and I also have 10 white dice so five can play with the neutral variant.  One of the die colors is purple so I can play with that variant as well, but haven't so far.  Also, since the dice are bigger I can use the original dice and add one larger die to each color that is worth two.

Las Vegas is a decent dice placement game. Roll dice and place corresponding locations numbers one through six. Highest will win the most money but if there is a tie, no one wins. It is entertaining and a nice filler, but has fewer rewarding decisions that other games of the same wight and type.

RATING: 5
Decent filler. There is a lot of randomness and it can be very swingy, especially with the punishing rule regarding ties, but it's a pure and very simple dice game. In fact, it's so simple that I imagine it can get old very fast. However, there are some slightly meaningful decisions and it doesn't overstay its welcome.

RATING: 6
It's a generally 'ok' game.  I do like that ties are resolved by 'removing' all tied players before resolving the winners.  So, it gives an interesting twist to it.  But, ultimately it's a random dice game.  Not that I don't like that type of thing, I just don't love it and can see playing this more, just not it lasting for years.

Es un juego de dados, ambientado en los Casinos de Las Vegas... pero no es un juego de dados de casino xD

En realidad, es un filler, que se juega por mayorias. cada jugador hace sus tiradas de dados y su objetivo es conseguir "los mejores premios" lo cual se consigue teniendo mayorias de resultados. 

Es uno de esos juegos que es mas facil jugarlo que explicarlo. Y es uno de esos fillers que, ademas de cumplir perfectamente para "rellenar la jornada", son muy divertidos, rejugables y faciles de jugar, pero suficientemente rico como para constituir un reto en cada partida. 

Top 10 de fillers. Muy recomendable.

A fun little filler game where you get to roll lots of dice. Very accessible. 

Tactics essentially revolve around using lots of dice at once to "lock up" your victory over a high-value card or else placing as few dice as possible so that you get to keep rolling after others have already gone. I have a feeling that the latter strategy is more powerful, especially at higher player counts, which is unfortunate as if everyone does this it becomes pretty random. 

It's fun, but I like my fillers to have at least a little more meat to them.

Super fluffy, and minimalist in the extreme. Just like the games in Vegas, your control is limited, yet excitement can run high. Nearly anyone can understand this, and I can see it being something gamers might pull out to play with non-gamers. For serious game groups, maybe a decent opener or closer. The neutral dice variant adds just a little more choice to the proceedings and is recommended.

We love this game for what it is: light, luck-based, fun party game! I grade this game on fun scale- not by its components or complex strategy... I showed this game to my 5 yr old son and he had a great time with it! It helped in teaching him number comparisons (is 6 bigger than 5?, is 10,000 bigger than 5,000?) and early strategy and planning ahead. This is a must own if you like playing party games! In a group, it certainly does shine- especially if you use the extra/neutral dice variant in a 5 player game!

(08/06/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is an very light, dice-throwing game, with dice allocation similar in feel to Yahtzee, but with a distinct flavor all its own.

On their turn, a player rolls 8x dice, along with 2x penalty dice. They then decide to allocate a single die or number of dice with the same number of pips to one of six "casinos" that is represented by that number of pips; they could also allocate one or both of the penalty dice instead to a casino. If the penalty dice have the same number as the player's dice being allocated, they must be allocated to the casino as well. Only one pip-type can be allocated each turn, but at least one dice must be allocated. Players in turn continue to allocate their own dice to the six casinos until everyone has allocated all of their dice, at which point the casinos are evaluated. For each casino, whomever has the greatest number of dice allocated will win the prize money at that casino (randomly distributed), while ties will disqualify them. Depending on the money distribution, it is possible to split some of the prize money. The penalty dice count as a non-player character, which could disqualify a player or two from gaining money. This entire cycle is repeated N-number of times for the number of players.

That is the entirety of the general rules breakdown. This is an extremely simple game in terms of mechanics, and is easy to teach. There is a lot of randomness, but there is some subtle strategy that veteran gamers may appreciate. At 20-30 minutes, it does not overstay its welcome, and results in a generally good time. It's not great, but it's not a bad filler. It is a solid "7".

My least favorite of the essential Vegas trio, but it's the quickest, easiest filler game of the bunch (casino-themed or otherwise).

Simple dice game that is enjoyable to teach/play.
If you have extra sets of dice, you can add in more players, or if you have less players, you can easily try out the "kicker" dice module from the expansion (just requires a set of dice no one is using). 

Another note, as per updated rules, the minimum amount of money at each casino is [player count + 1 * 10k]. This way when playing with 5+ people, there is still an adequate amount of money to squabble over.

Based on Raj(Hol's der Geier) rules, Las Vegas has added dice rolling mechanics. Playing time is longer than Raj. I would rather enjoy Raj instead of Las Vegas. Of course, Las Vegas has its own attractiveness. Because the game uses dice, the game aspect of Las Vegas is more energetic and dynamic. By the way, the game is still a party game. Regarding as a party game, Las Vegas takes quite long time. Especially, on other players' turn, I feel nothing to do and nothing is interesting. This game is not my cup of tea.

An alarmingly simple but thoroughly enjoyable dice rolling game.  You simply throw your dice and assign all dice showing a number of your choosing to a "casino" which can only accept dice of a certain number.  Repeat this until all dice are assigned and the area majority decides who gets the spoils.  The big twist is that all ties are out of contention for the prize, meaning a player with only 1 die can win over 2 players with 5 dice each, for example.

It might be totally and utterly arbitrary luck, but it's great fun and plays in a quick time.

Bokkensprong 20/02/2015. Eenvoudig dobbel-gokspel. Ieder heeft 8 dobbelstenen in een bepaalde kleur. 1-6 komt overeen met telkens een gokplaats waar geld te verdienen is (telkens minstens 50 kUSD). Dobbel, kies een aantal ogen, en leg alle stenen met die ogen op de bijhorende plaats. Idem voor volgende speelrondes tot niemand stenen over heeft. Wie ergens het meest dobbelstenen heeft liggen, wint het bijhorende geld. Aantal spelrondes = aantal spelers. Leuk als afsluiter.

On my first play, one player made an unlucky roll, causing me (and him) to lose out on that number.  The person who benefited won the game.  The frequency of such a thing in future games will probably help determine whether my rating goes up or down from here.  Update: This game pretends to be strategic, but it's not.  You can somewhat control what happens in the early rolls, but the late rolls are all luck.  If you don't get hung up on that, you can still have fun with it.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (June 2015)

Las Vegas is a light dice throwing game. You can explain it under 5 minutes and playtime is around 30 minutes. For me, Las Vegas is a regular game, it is way too light and random for my liking, furthermore if you have the time length into account, it is too long for what it offers.

I recognize it can be fun with the right game group, but I don‚Äôt have any desire to play it again. 

The decisions needed in the game are very easy, seems the best strategy is to never commit a lot of dice so you leave your options open and the luck will take care of the rest (very low decision making). There is luck in the way the bills appear and in the dice, of course :D.

The game art and components is nice.

I think Las Vegas can be a good familiar game.

Bottom line, I won‚Äôt pursue anymore plays of it again. Perhaps on the iPhone. The main problem for me is the, relatively speaking, long playtime. If the mood strikes, I will play Roll for It! instead.

Las Vegas is a special game that takes the simplicity of rolling dice and adds just enough strategy to the luck to make your choices important and interesting.  Roll, place and win cash.  Simple as that.  But, unlike Las Vegas (the city), winning $470,000 doesn't mean you've won!  Lots of fun in a nice, little package!

2015-04-14: Initial rating as 9! Wow! I really enjoy this. It brings a smile to my face. I've played it as the normal, 4-round game or in an express 2-round game that I think encapsulates all the tension in a 4-round. It has a more all-or-nothing feel to it that way. Regardless, pretty much everyone I've played this with has enjoyed it. It's my current go-to filler.

RATING: 6
Players layout the six "casino" tables, each assigned to one face of a d6. Money cards in denominations of $10k to $90k are laid out next to each table until the total equals at least $50k, which leaves usually from 1-3 cards next to each table. Players each have a personal set of six dice. On a turn a player rolls all of their dice and allocate all of one number to the matching table. Play goes around until all dice are allocated and then money is doled out by dice majorities, with tied dice eliminating each other. Repeat for 4 rounds and most money wins.

Sounds stupidly simple, but there was more thought around allocating dice to tables than I expected. Yes, when you are down to 1 or 2 dice then pretty much all decisions are made by the roll, so your early decisions when you have more dice is where the real game is. This is a very good dice filler, perfect for kicking off or ending a solid night of gaming.

This is a fun filler with lots of dice to roll and enough light strategy to keep it interesting. Variable high denominations of cash are dealt out so each spot has a minimum if $50,000. Each turn you can place all of the dice of one number onto a tile to bid for the cash. You are trying to outbid other players, but can only win one denomination. Second place would take the next lower denomination and so on. Every one also has two dice of a dummy player which can also outbid players. On a tie no one wins adding to the challenge. It makes for a fun warm up game.

RATING: 7.5
Involves rolling dice and then placing them to trying to get the majority for that number (1-6) and win money.  Although a draw will result in loosing out.
This is a push your luck game which is light and easy to play.  Requires understanding of probability theory to come up with strategy, but other than that it's pure luck.
It plays a lot of players and is great fun.  Can played with anyone of any age.  Although the gambling theme might but parents off from playing with their kids.
This seems to be more of a party game as I don't think it would play well with 2 or 3.  I think 4 or more are needed.
I think this is really fun simple filler/party game.

Vegas reminds me of the 1992 Dorra game [gameid=841] with dice instead of cards. In both games, a varying amount of money is deposited at each location and players can choose where to gamble for the money. While Razzia featured simultaneous card selection, Vegas has players rolling dice. The twist is that the trailing player gets lucky when the leaders block themselves out. Nothing new but fine for a quick, simple fun game. It is dominated by luck - even for a dice game there's comparably low influence.

I'm not sure that this belongs in the Alea line (though Alea games are so varied in quality that's not saying much), but I'll take it. Las Vegas is very quickly learned and played, and the theme (while not exactly original) makes sense. And who can't love the ridiculous picture of the guy rolling the dice on the front cover of the game?

I love the crazy luck of the dice as well as the confrontational aspect of the game. There usually tends to be very lopsided victories, but the journey is fun!

I can perfectly understand the SdJ nomination this game received. I wasn't anyhow interested in even trying it, but it was suggested and it turned out to be a really nice dice filler which gives me the same kind of feelings that I've earlier got when playing High Society. What's also really nice is that the dynamic of the game changes a lot with different amounts of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid game which uses dice to constraint your possibilities, without falling into the randomness trap. All randomness being pre-decision is also nice. Las Vegas leads to stand up moments, to cursing at one another, to shouting in glee (or horror) as we see the die rolls, and this makes for a solid way to spend time with muggles. That being said, I will not use it as a game night filler anymore: it's too long for a relatively shallow game.

Kniziaesque dice game of maximizing your income-to-investment ratio, with some probability management and some screwage, random or otherwise. Nice components. More accessible than deep. The two-player game, even with variant dice, didn't seem to offer many turns where the results of a roll didn't strongly suggest the correct move.

Thrifted on 11/11 2015.

"Overall? The Vegas Dice Game is a¬†great little dice game (especially for $20!). It's simple and straightforward, which is always nice, but it's also at a solid price point that makes it a great gift (or, a great gateway game, if you're trying to get people into more complex fare). I like the components, I enjoy the tension, and even though there's direct conflict, it's more in an area-control sense than a "take-that" sense. Sure, it's a dice-chucker, so it's going to have a pretty large luck element, but if you're looking for a short game in that vein (similar to, say, Dragon Slayer), I'd recommend checking this one out!"

Quick area control with lots of dice rolling and luck pushing. Needs quite a few players though since the game relies on... how to put it? It relies on the table bringing it to life. On having the players feverish hope for a good die roll, put all their eggs into a single basket and still failing, etc.

RATING: 8
An excellent dice game. The variant rules in which everyone gets dice representing the house make the game much more interesting. I quite like this with 2 or 3 players because each person gets more dice for the house. 

The expansion adds a lot of new elements into the game, and while they're all as good, a few of them are so good that I have decided to always include them. 

The only downside is that the game is overpriced, especially if you get the expansion too. The whole thing should come in a single box, and a smaller box, for a lower price. But this is good enough for a dice game that will be enjoyed by a wide range of people that for me, at least, these are minor quibbles. I worry about gameplay more than price.

An area control game where you roll a bunch of dice? Sign my up. I really enjoy the tactical nature of this dice rolling game, each turn you roll your dice and allocate all of one number to the casino of the matching number, at the end of the round majorities in the casinos will pay out cash of varying amounts. However, I will always recommend playing with the "slot machine" mini expansion or finding a good proxy for it if you can't find the card/tile. It adds another option for your dice while keeping the decision space fairly tight.

In more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.

Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked "1". You must place at least one die per turn, although you may place more. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it. In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino.

RATING: 6.8
Before play: It's really strange this is an alea game. It feels like those very light (good) Knizias that are sold in small boxes - it feels like Pickomino meets Loco! or something along these lines, not to mention it's very easy to make PnP if you have enough dice (well, with an appropriate scoreboard you don't even need so many dice). 
Maybe the cover image is a nod to Knizia for this Knizian nature?

After one play: it's ultra-light but it's fun. We had fun at least.

I wish there was an option to reroll some once you have already placed them. It was interesting to see people cancel each other out on big cards on the last roll & no one gets it. I rolled well & ended up winning my first game. Some strategy, but lots of luck. I'll ended up getting this for Christmas.

Sure it has a lot of luck, but it is also really streamlined and the varying amounts of money in each pot makes for some fairly variable area majority, whereas in terms of the dice allocation you can go for either putting the number you have the most of to have the best chance to get the largest cash value, or stall by putting as few as possible each turn so you have more information as where to assign your last few dice.

Simple filler game where each player has 8 dice.  You fill casinos which correspond with pips on the dice with payouts ranging from 10 k to 100 k.  You place money on casinos until there is a least 50 k on it.  Players roll dice and you organize dice by pips, you place all dice with same number rolled on a casino to have a majority to claim the payout.  You keep placing dice until all players have placed dice.   If two or more players tie with the same number of dice at a casino, the dice are removed.  Remaining players the payout otherwise there is no payout.  

Light, simple filler game.  Surprisingly fun even though you have little control over the dice rolls.

I bought this largely because without it there'd be a gap in my set of Alea boxes. That is to say, I wasn't really sold on the description alone. The game is very simple to play, and I was skeptical that it would be anything other than a random dice-fest... but I was wrong.

Sure, there's a bunch of luck involved in Las Vegas, but the strategy comes from finding the right balance between risk and reward. Occasionally you'll have a turn where there's an obviously "correct" move, but most of the time you are faced with a number of tough choices, and there's not necessarily a right or wrong move.

Play is reasonably quick, but I genuinely think there is more depth here than in a lot of the sorts of games that often get slapped with the "filler" label.

First impressions after one 2 player game.  Not ready to give a rating since I only played it with 2 players, and this is clearly a game intended for more than 2 players.  I would also be interested in playing the variant with the neutral dice.  The game is a gambling/push your luck game, easy to teach/learn and easy to play.  In two the choices are not very interesting, they are mostly obvious and dictated by the luck of the roll and the number crunching.

There's some choice in staking out a spot or vying for control, but the choices aren't often all that meaningful. Rounds tend to finish with a string of random forced plays.

Fast playing. I prefer the ghost variant (white dice) to the vanilla game.

Good production but pricey and large for a featherlight dice chucker.

This game depends a great deal on those players and their interactions, almost outside of the game.  It offers a bit of strategy (maybe even faux strategy) and is very luck dependent.  However, like most games with dice, where one roll can determine ones fate, you do find yourself hanging on the last die rolls of every round and to me, that was a lot of fun.   The game I played was with 8, so I expect that even further contributed to the absolute chaos.

There's not a whole lot going on in Las Vegas. In a nutshell, you roll and allocate dice, collecting as much money as possible to win the game. That's it. There might be a handful of viable strategies (a stretch), but nothing brain-burning or even that interesting. That said, for muggles, this game is great. It's a light gateway game with a familiar theme. Interestingly, I played Las Vegas just a week after playing Lords of Vegas for the first time. No comparison! Granted, Lords of Vegas has a LOT more going on, but it too, like Las Vegas, is a gateway--a decidedly better one. Yet, I would not play Lords of Vegas with some people (particularly novice gamers that didn't have an analytical mind). This game is cool though. It won't be a lot of people's favorite, but it's still solid.

I can see why people enjoy this light filler. It's just that I didn't feel the 'tension' in the first and probably only time I played this. So I think it's pretty boring. 

Gets another point down for the 'box filled with air' factor. It should be very easy to play this with components pulled from other games everyone has lying around, so for me there's no point at all in buying this.

Update: played it again with a couple of my favorite players. Had more fun than during the first game. It's not really bad, but it's something you might pull out if you're in the mood for something really light and dicey.

RATING: 9.5
This one has gone over very well with several casual groups.  As a dice game, there's certainly an element of randomness and you may get frustrated if you go into this trying to pursue a specific strategy.  The theme is very appealing and the play just works well.  It's easy to teach and I've played it a few times with 6 players just fine.  I do wish the play was a bit quicker (most games are about 45 minutes), but each player needs to wait until the previous player makes their decision before rolling dice in order to not influence their decision, so you can't really plan ahead.  Strategy gamers might want a little more depth and flexibility than this offers, but I would definitely recommend this as an enjoyable, approachable game for casual gamers just looking for something fun.

I recently got this half off at Target and it has been a hit with both my game groups AND my family on Thanksgiving.  I love that it takes only a minute to explain and 20 minutes to play.

When I have the opportunity to teach games to non-gamers, Las Vegas is my choice. It has never failed. I've decided to teach the white dice variation right from the start. It's more fun to play that way and doesn't add too much complexity to the rules or setup.

Las Vegas has become my most played game because its solo option plays so quickly. The game plays in 15 minutes, a minute setup for the next.

Als Grundspiel klasse und sch√∂n knackig kurz! Haben die neue Erweiterung getestet und waren davon nur wenig angetan.

Da gef√§llt uns die Grund-Variante doch wesentlich besser. Einzeln hinzugenommen m√∂gen einzelne der Module evtl. etwas mehr Varianz ins Spiel bringen, aber nach unserm empfinden wirkt sich das eindeutig negativ auf das zuvor sehr gute Spielspa√ü zu Spielzeit Verh√§ltnis aus.

Light. So light. I haven't yet had the chance to try the "strategic" variant of neutral dice, as my plays have been at the max player count, but for what it is, it's actually quite fun. Chuck a lot of dice, make a quick tactical decision, screw your neighbor. The kind of game in which you don't care too much if you win or not. Definite filler and must be played fast if it's to not outstay its welcome.

Played with six players (rules go to five) with external dice and it worked fine after we upped the minimum money per casino from 50 to 70. Still haven't tired neutral dice.

Wow, so boring! How did this get get an SdJ nomination?

The game consists of throwing a handful of dice and assigning all of a particular value to a casino, e.g. all of the 5s I rolled to the 5 casino. Keep going until everyone has assigned all their dice, the person with majority in each casino gets a pay out. Do it all again another 3 times. Does that sound like it isn't much of a game? Well that is because it isn't. I was amazed at just how tedious this game is.

RATING: 7
Only one play of this and it was very enjoyable. Lots of dice a bit of luck and a heap of fun. Basically, players roll their dice and then allocate one number to a casino in the hope of having the most dice there at the end of the round and collecting the loot on offer. The kicker is that if two players tie they cancel each other out and the next highest is the winner. This encourages strategic placement of dice where it looks like two ‚Äòheavy hitters‚Äô may tie. Players are also presented decisions about whether to commit early and ‚Äòscare off‚Äô would be challengers or hold back and hope for a late sure - if the dice are kind.

This game would work as a good filler when you have five or six players at a loose end for ten or fifteen minutes.

I would consider purchasing this game if the price was right and would be very unlikely to knock back a game or two (that would about do it in any one session for me) if it was on offer and I was looking for a filler.

A light dice roller where the 'take that' is quite high as the players aim to control a series of casino locations, particularly the ones with the highest valued winnings.

This one couldn't be simpler and feels more like a party game than a series strategy title. The luck factor is quite high and whilst I can have a good time with this I prefer another game in the Alea stable of the same box size called Alea Iacta Est. 

But that title is more for gamers and this is more for the casual gaming crowd so form that point of view they both fill a different niche and target audience.

Six casino tables are seeded with a number of bills. You roll dice to put your dice onto the tables, only one table at a time, corresponding to the quantity and number you rolled. Then it is the next player's turn, and you keep rolling until all your dice are placed. At the end of the round whoever has the most dice gets the highest bill for each table, second most gets the second bill and so forth. There are also neutral dice which affect the majority, and if there is a tie, both sets of dice are eliminated.

It's a fun game, and there is a bit of strategy. Do you load most of your dice on one table or do you spread out your dice? So there are some interesting decisions. There is luck as well, so you have to balance that out.

This is a wonderful filler, gateway or family game.  The rules are incredibly simple and require no reading .  Yet, you feel like you're making meaningful choices.

The components are great.  

It may not be a game to play for hours and hours, but it is a great thing to bring out for a family game night.

This isn't the most complex game in the world we can agree on that. You roll dices and place them.BUT, whenever I bring that game to the table people always love it and new players to the game always get hooked. It's one of my favorite family board game.

RATING: 8
Fun and simple, I see this getting a lot of play with my non-gamer family.  Playing with the white dice variant feels essential, but not so much on the Las Vegas Boulevard expansion beyond the extra dice for a 6-8 players.  It complicates the simply purity of the game and feels unnecessary.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Combines elements of dice-rollers Pickomino and Alea Iacta Est, but without the arc of the former or the variety of decisions in the latter, so I guess it combines the mediocre of those two games. Good brain commitment to fun ratio, but it takes a bit longer than expected -- in part because you don't all roll the dice simultaneously.
-----
House ruling that you must roll dice simultaneously (and hide) makes the game a full point more fun. Sometimes you just want to play a highly luck-based game, so who gives a crap about arcs or decision variety...
-----
With the Boulevard expansion, Las Vegas accommodates up to 8. A 7-player session with select modules (7th casino, big die, ? cards, extra players [duh]) went over really well as a warm-up game, but it was also the right atmosphere for it.

Man, does Las Vegas bring both the fun and the pain.  The dice mechanic is simple enough for anyone to easily understand, but the house dice add a layer of strategy that is MUCH deeper than first glance.  Add various expansions from Las Vegas Boulevard, and you've got a game that has never failed to win at Game Night.  (Vegas lost to Kingdom Builder for the SdJ, and that was the first sign that the Spiel has lost its way.)

One variant we've tested and enjoyed: Let the ghost House player keep their money.  Let the House AI possibly win the game outright.

Horrible filler 'game', a boring dicefest. I have associated Alea with gaming excellence. Even the weaker Alea games had something interesting to show. This one has absolutely nothing. How on earth Mr Bruck decided to publish this one? It's a shame.

Annoyingly enjoyable dice-rolling area control, with the awesome ties-luck-out mechanic that makes Fiji and Big Shot such intriguing games. Frequent uproarious moments based entirely on the luck of the die, no downtime, and yet an impressive number of choices.

It's difficult to imagine a situation where I'd turn down a quick game of this. And the bottom line is that's the sort of thing that makes a great game.

[i]I ended up acquiring both the base game and expansion, but ended up trading it away after playing a few games with my family. It was not the hit I thought it would be and I have a lot of other dice games I would much rather play. I also found that the game dragged after a while, this is not a game I need to play again (I think Qwixx is a much better family/gateway dice game).[/i]

This is a blast! This is impressively simple to learn and play. I would say it is also a great party game too. It also plays extremely well with just 2 players and all the way up to 5. A 2-player poker/gambling game? Now that's outstanding! 

Lay out the Casino tiles...each with a number from 1 to 6 corresponding to the numbers on a die. Roll your dice and commit one set of numbers that you roll to one casino (matching the die roll). Each casino will have an amount of money that you could win. The highest number of commited dice for that casino will take the highest money card, any players in second, third, etc. places will take the next lower amounts of money. Any tied players will get nothing. All this lasts for just 4 rounds, count your money and see who wins. Sweet fun!

One of the best games from my favorite designer, Rudiger Dorn. The design is simple, yet so swift and engaging until the last throw of the die. Las Vegas maintains a perfect balance of strategy (while limiting AP) and randomness (which keeps the game exciting but not infuriating). Another fantastic game to decompress with after a heavy four or five hour Euro. Great game for veteran players and new gamers. And the expansion just adds to the enjoyment for this game: swapping out modules that add different levels of strategy and randomness.

Simple dice rolling affair, competing to get the majority in several of 6 areas each turn. A turn is rolling dice, choosing one number you rolled, and adding all dice in that number to the area represented by that number. All 1's must go to the 1 area for instance. Continue taking turns until all dice have been rolled and allocated. Having the most dice in an area gets you the biggest money card in that area (there's often only one), second gets the second and so on, but all ties are knocked out Raj-style, meaning you can sneak a first when candidates knock themselves out, tieing in the aim of rolling more dice in that number later but failing. Which can be funny. So it's a game of choosing where to compete, which is groan and smile inducing, followed by the drama of the latter rounds when people are cheering/groaning for a particular number to steal a win. It's nice and simple as a result, and provides excellent value in its opener/closer type niche.

What I like:
- Easy to learn and teach
- Some interesting decisions
- Plays quick (5p learning game in 30 minutes)

What I don't like:
- Majority based (a mechanism I dislike)
- Can run long (4p game took 55 minutes)
- Basically an abstract

At 30 minutes, it's a good filler. At 55 minutes, there are meatier games I would much rather play. You could play fewer or more rounds. The ties-both-lose rule is brutal.

The 1.2 voted weight seems reasonable.

RATING: 8
Las Vegas is one of the rare instances of a highly luck-driven game where I don't mind that luck; I've come from far behind to win in the fourth round, and had a win snatched from me, but it all feels perfectly thematic.  I love the press-your-luck aspect of the ties, without which I think the game is weak.  I also prefer the 3- and 4-player games with neutral dice, which I think add a lot of interesting strategy to the play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Las Vegas is a press-your-luck dice game that's scored using an area majority mechanic.  There are six casino boards, one for each die face, each of which has a randomly-assigned pile of money under it.  During your turn, you roll your 8 dice, and decide which of those dice you want to place on the corresponding casino.  Whoever has the most dice on a casino will claim the largest bill, second will claim second, and so on.  The main decision point is whether you want to commit to a casino sooner, or hold most of your dice until later, once you've seen what other people will do.  Usually later is better in area majority games, but the vagaries of dice rolling increases the uncertainty.  I was surprised how well this game worked.

As a dice filler this one is a decent one. It's a little bit more satisfying than Dungeon Roll which I previously owned. When talking about dice filler we want to chuck dice all the time and this provides that. The white dice variant is a must for this game. I can't imagine playing this game without it. It adds a negative/risk management layer to the game compared to just throwing your own dice. I did fist pumps when the roll went my way and my heart was broken when the dice started to hate me. It's a fine game on it's own. 

I think I am done with buying fillers for now. I can't seem to get a game that gets a better score than 7/10 from a filler now. Maybe I have too many fillers, or it could be that I am seeking games that are meatier and requires more thinking/planning.

Have played 5-player games with different friends. All of them felt exciting about it. We finally know why it calls Las Vegas since at some moments, people will shout for a number like "Give me 1 two will be enough to win, two, two" before they threw the dices. During the game, there will be a lot of interaction, a lot of strategy in order to get high score. Human factor also will be involved which can determine who to win. (like "Don't get my number, it will just get $30000. Get his One which will give you $90000. It worths!) A quick, easy to learn, fun game.

Our group would not consider playing without the neutral white dice.

To more easily manage the dice we use the cups from Dice Town to roll and then turn them face down on the table to signify that all dice have been allocated to the boards. We found that this speeds up play towards the end of each round.

Fun little party/family game.  Lots of luck involved, but playing with the neutral dice variant adds some interesting decisions.  I won't play without this variant.  I want to get two more dice colors to be able to play with more people.  It would be cool to have 7 colors for a 6 player game.  For the neutral variant, each of the 6 players would get 1 white die and the other two would be rolled and placed at the beginning of each round.  Minimum at each casino would be 70K instead of 50.

This little dice game is an excellent "filler" and is just a lot of fun.  Nice little push-your-luck, area control dice game where you try to obtain the most money.   The "advanced" variant with a neutral player is an absolute necessity for this to be more than a one-time-play though.

2-5 players.  Despite being a light weight game, Las Vegas is really a lot of fun and addictive, even with 2 players.  There's something about rolling lots of dice that I find very satisfying.  And even though luck is a notable factor, I have found that there is a strategy that will sometimes give the more experienced player a slight edge.  I like that it serves as a great filler game and is nice for those times where you just want to relax and enjoy a light game.

This is a fun really light dice game.  there are interesting decisions with plenty of opportunity to counteract bad dice rolls.  This definitely has a good push your luck feel to it.  Playing with the neutral dice variant is very different than the base game.  Both are interesting but I think I like it better with the variant at least with 2 players.  Just a good fun non-frustrating dice game.

So many dice!

This game intrigued me based on reading/watching a few video reviews. It's "just rolling dice", but gives you a lot of choices in how to place those dice in the hopes of maximizing your chances of winning some money each round. Do you use up a bunch of your dice early to safely secure a big note, or spread them around hoping to get a bit lucky and win a bunch of pots? And then with your last few rolls, you might need to get truly lucky.

Luck does play a good part of who wins (at least that seems to be the case to me based on a few plays) with tactical dice placement tipping the odds in one's favor. Seems like a good balance and it plays quickly so having a larger luck factor than I might otherwise want in a game is fine. I also think that will help keep people engaged with the game as they can generally have a chance to come back with a few perfect rolls.

Big plus for me is that this game is simple to explain and fits a niche in my collection which I did not have prior. I could see this getting a decent amount of play with my family.

I really enjoyed this dice chucker. Granted it's pretty "light", but there are some decisions to make. There's also enough randomness with how the money comes out, neutral dice, and dice rolls. Since it plays so fast, it would be a great filler.

The rules are very easy to learn. But it offers some strategy and tactics: shall I place many dice to claim a bill, or shall I try to put only one die on several bills? Maybe it's better to place less dice each turn so I have more turns and am the last player in the round to place their dice, which offers me better chances to get majorities? For sure it's funny to tease other players by nullifying their dice.

Played once with 3P. A quick dice game of area majority. Each turn, players roll their dice and choose a value, placing all dice of that value on the corresponding valued area. The player with the majority of dice in a certain area wins the money, but in a [thing=1125][/thing]-style twist, tied amounts are passed over. 

There are some difficult decisions early on over which dice to place, but these decisions are often overridden by the luck of dice rolls towards the end of the round. The neutral dice variant is great and adds the ability to mess with opponents, all the while being careful not to inadvertently screw yourself over later on.

Played twice just 2-player at home to get the feel of it and make sure I knew the very simple rules.  I had picked up this game to bring to the first ever game night I was going to host at the local assisted living facility.  It was o.k. at 2-player but nothing special.  Played 3-player next and the game began to shine!  It became much for cutthroat and player interaction began to rise.  We enjoyed it very much and think it will be even greater with more people, the variant, and the expansion.  I've started this out at 8 but have no doubt it will rise as this will be an easy game to get to the table.  My husband even requested to play again! The variant with the neutral white dice is the way to go.

Great, quick dice-roller with some good decisions.  Sure, there are several games like this, but Vegas doesn't pretend to give you something that it shouldn't.  It's about VEGAS, and so there's going to be some luck involved.  Honestly, adding the white dice raises the game from a 7 to an 8 in my view.  I really, really enjoy it with the white dice and it's been a success for me 2-5 players.

I'd seen this played several times before, and it always looked like everyone was having a good time with it. It's a nice push-your-luck / area-majority game with very simple rules but a lot of fun packed in there!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Every player has a set of 8d6 in their color. Each of the 4 rounds is set up the same way: place money cards in each of the 6 numbered columns until there is at least $50,000 total per column. On your turn, roll all your dice, then allocate every die of a particular number (you choose from those you rolled) to the matching column. Round ends when all dice from all players have been allocated. In each column, reward highest value card to player with most dice, 2nd most valuable card to next player, etc ... with one exception: all tied players cancel each other out! The player with the most money after 4 rounds wins!

That simple rule about tied dice counts makes the game much more interesting -- lots of fun to be had here!

RATING: 5
Players roll eight dice of their colour (plus, with the good rules, some neutral dice) and choose a number to assign, Pickomino-style, to one of six casinos -- all 1s to the 1 casino, all 2s to the 2 etc. Once dice are all assigned, the majority in each casino gets the cash, with ties cancelling each other out and the prize going to the next highest.

It's perfectly adequate, but feels simultaneously incredibly random (your choices are dictated entirely by your roll) and unexciting (not even the excitement of a "push your luck" mechanism). Not for me.

Excellent dice game with lots of strategic and tactical decisions. One strategy consists of placing only one die apiece to keep back a reserve for the end of the round. Another strategy might be to strongly invest in one slot to intimidate others.

Dicey filler. More Pickomino than Alea Iacta Est. Fast turns. Potential for sudden comebacks, self-destructing rolls, cheeky steals, fun & laughter.

The [i]"everyone also rolls neutral"[/i] variant for 2-4 players adds another layer of decisions without adding complexity. [i]Highly[/i] recommended if playing with fewer than 5.

One of the little pleasures of life is watching an opponent roll his last neutral die and have to place it such that it eliminates his own dice and gifts the rewards to another player.

The Boulevard expansion takes the base game into a number of different directions, with different amounts of added complexity.

Flawed. There are plenty of push-your-luck games that I enjoy. Can't Stop comes to mind (and the top of my list). Las Vegas starts with an enjoyable premise, but it so often feels like it's not even your own decisions that are deciding the the game that I can't recommend Las Vegas. It's vindictiveness on top of luck of the roll, and that's just a little too much for me.

A somewhat strange game from the Alea line, which is known for its gamers' games. Las Vegas is lighter than most family games. Vegas plays quickly and is a pleasant enough way to pass the time, but I don't envision it getting a lot of play with my game group. Update: I was wrong. The game has hit the table quite a bit with my game group, in large part because of its simplicity and quick play. It's even grown on me a bit ... it will never be a huge favorite, but it has established a little niche and my rating has been bumped up from 5 to 6.

The dice mechanic of Vegas is so simple that you'll be smacking your forehead you never thought of it before.  The components are oddly grim for a casino themed game, but if you swap out the dice with some proper Chessex sets, you've got the action that Alea was afraid to commit to.  Let it ride, baby!

RATING: 7
A fun game in a similar vein to For Sale or No Thanks.  I do prefer those two, though, because I prefer when all players have equal chances to react to a turn of luck (the card draws, in those cases) whereas luck is individualized (dice rolls) in this one.

(That's a weird articulation of my thought, but hopefully it gets my point across...)

Rudiger Dorn game which is a good thing. It's one of those games that has basic components(Top notch in quality but basic in prinicple) but marries them with simple mechanics to make a game that is so elegant and replayable it will make you angry with yourself for not having come up with this idea. Damn you Dorn for taking what is right in front of us and teaching us a new way to use it. Highly recommend this game for all groups.

RATING: 7
20+ plays with groups ranging from 2 players to 8 players (I bought extra dice). The ages have ranged from 8-87. I have played with family, friends and strangers. It has worked with them all. Truthfully, two players is a little soft, but it does work when that is what you've got.

For 9 years For Sale has always been my "sure thing". The game that always worked with any group. And it still is, but For Sale can only play 3-6.

Dixit and Las Vegas now go where For Sale can't go. To the higher (and lower) player counts. Dixit for innocent, family fun. Las Vegas when you want to have a drink or two or get a little loud.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4.25

A game of placing dice into bins matching their numnbers to get majority places in that bins for first pick at varying value scoring notes.

I was expecting this to be too simplistic to be interesting, but while it is luck-driven, the decisions in a 3-player game with neutral dice are really good, and the neutral dice give a good amount of stabbing.

With four players (and no neutral) things were a little less interesting, although the dynamic of the game might be similar, now two players couldn't band together to work on neutral dice to catch a leader. I'll try 4p again adding neutral dice to see if this helps.

First Imrpession:

A dice auction game.. or should I say a dice "area control" game (thanks Vangelis, I'm still laughing at that comment)

It's a fun quick game that creates a lot of buzz and table talk. Give this game to a highly spirited group, and it becomes a blast! Interesting 4p rules make this game work with a twist.

The theme turns some of the potential non-gamers away from the game and draws others towards it, though this game has little to do with actual Las Vegas. A lot of rolling means a lot of luck but the betting mitigates that a bit. 

Overall, I really enjoyed it, even though I thought I wouldn't. It may yet become one of my favorite fillers/pure fun games.

This game receives the higher rating from me based only on playing with the Boulevard expansion.

OK filler that certainly offers some excitement in the final rolls of a round. Only played with the variant (each player rolls some neutral dice in addition to his own), because it offers an additional tactical decision each roll. You may question if you really control anything in this game, but it is short and fun enough for occasional play. Have not tried playing the game with five players, but I feel like that would probably one player too many.

This is one of the few games that is actually a bit more fun than the rules indicate. It is deceptively simple and appears to have little to no strategic planning required. But some simple calculation of odds does go a long way in enhancing victory. Still, players are at the mercy of the die roll. As much as you want to place your die in an empty column, if you don't roll that number, you won't get to place in that casino. The bulk of the decision comes from deciding when to place the die and when to delay placement in hopes of rolling those same numbers later down the road. The variant using neutral dice does add an additional layer of much-welcomed complexity to this game.

A better than expected game that is still below expectation for a Dorn design.

An alright game.  Not much to it, even as a filler.  Decisions are pretty basic, doesn't feel as much like betting or push your luck as I would hope for in a Dice game.  It plays quickly, yet somehow still feels like it overstays it's welcome with 5.  Might be better with less players using the white dice variant.

UPDATE: Played with 2 players, and the score has jumped up substantially.  The addition of the white dice really add a whole layer of strategy that is missing in a 5 player game.  Suddenly you have good and potentially bad dice hitting the table, have to decide how best to benefit and stunt your opponent with each roll.

One two-player game with variant to use "3rd player". Very fast dicefest, which fits nicely to the casino world.

Game is simple, roll the dice and set aside all the dices with one number you choose. Those dice are set on the corresponding casino. Then other player rolls the dice, does the same, repeat until all the dice on the casinos. The player who has most dice on the casino gets the biggest amount of money and so on. The money is randomly set on the casinos at the start of the game.

Good filler, I don't believe it has content enough to play much, but works on occasional play.

The second play with four. Still nice, but gets a bit long and downtime increases, because there's basically nothing to plan. You can only hope to get the needed dice.

I really enjoyed this game. The element of competition is edgy and fun, it moves quickly enough that there's no downtime and is simple enough that you don't need a long turn to decide on your action, very straight-forward, reasonable element of chance (not so much that there's no point in playing but enough that each game is different and you're on your toes with each roll). I personally like games with a little chance- and a fun theme. This was definitely a winner all-around.

Las Vegas is a nice, light weight game that has very simple rules, rather simple strategy and is fun to play.  It's great between heavier games or when there is more of a social group rather than a intense group.  It is a great game to play and socialize over.  You don't have to think about between your turns, you don't have all that much to consider on your turn either.  

Las Vegas does have a heavier luck aspect than some in our group enjoy.  It is more luck than skill, but for some, especially the teens/pre-teens in our group, they enjoy it.  It allows them to play a game quickly, get a bit of "take that" in without a larger commitment to a longer or heavier game.  

Really quick to setup, really quick to play.  The theme is light, pointless, but enjoyable.  Gives it a dash of flavor over what it is, a simple dice rolling game.  It is almost like a Las Vegas themed interactive Yatzee.  

It is fun and I am always happy to play it.  I'll only suggest it for the right situation or the right group.  But would never turn down a game if someone suggested it.   Great gateway game.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] Las Vegas is a small addictive game, surprisingly fast & simple. On my first game, we played a 4 player game. Luck is one major factor in this game, but you may control it with a little strategy. On my 2nd try, it was  2 players game. On this one, we added the Dummy's rule as each player takes an equal amount of dice so as to play the dummy. They place the Dummy's dice as if they we're their dice. When counting the points, those dice's belongs to the Dummy's player.

I have found that I'm really enjoying dice games. However, there seems to be less strategy in this game than I originally thought.

Yes, the game is very luck driven. You might roll all or almost all the same numbers and you will be forced to put them on some number, which won't be beneficial to you (it is usually better to spread out your dice between casinos) or that casino can have a small amount of money. But the game is very quick. And it should be a blast in a party setting with bigger crowd with everyone cheering for their rolls and cursing opponents for stealing their money under their noses :)

Great quick dice rolling game, where luck plays a big part. But you do have the chance to play it more safely, or to take bigger risks.

Very good for what it is. Simple, and even though it's extremely luck based the decisions are impactful and important. usually. good for playing between heavy games as a reset.

Excellent dice game.  Everyone i've played this with has enjoyed it.  Expansion allows for more strategy and another player so I went for it.

Played twice. Such a simple game: I can definitely see this as an ideal gateway. Naturally there is quite some luck, but that also brings some suspense, especially later in the round. Not that astounding as a game to me personally, but I would absolutely recommend it to people who haven't played a lot of designer games before.

This is one heck of a fun filler, and ofttimes exciting dice game with a real gambling flair. It works very well with casual gamers, and families. The expansion is fantastic too.

Very good "filler" game.

Simple fun. The luck element created by the use of dice fits the Vegas theme quite nicely, and you can't help but feel like you've stepped into a casino when you're playing. It's basically like Roll for It, but with money.

How simple can a game be? You roll your dice, and you place all of dice of one number on the corresponding casino. If you have two dice left, and you roll doubles? No choice left, just place the dice on the corresponding casino. Player with the most dice on a casino wins the highest value that is placed at the casino. Player who comes 2nd, gets the next highest amount (if there is any). Play four rounds, and add up your earned money. Player with the most money wins.

Sounds easy? Can this be called a game, that fits in the Alea range? Yes, it‚Äôs easy. Does it fit in the Alea range? No, it doesn‚Äôt. But what does it matter?  No hard thinking involved. No though decisions are to be made during the game. But it‚Äôs fun. Especially when played with unexperienced players. Well, even with experienced players it‚Äôs fun.

Love the use of dice in this game. They are an element of luck in a fairly analytical game.

Super light dice game.  I guess it is an OK filler for a few minutes.  There are better light dice games though.

Best light dice roller out there. Good for so many laughs. The neutral dice are essential to a fun game, I think.

I feel like with more dice, you should be able to add more players easily.

After 1 Play: This game shouldn't work.  I'd written it off after hearing the rules, but was surprised by the fun had in actually playing it.  I'll need more plays to determine if that fun was really due to the game, or just to the people I was paying with.

If you play with the variant (neutral dice) it's a super cool game - without it: not so much. With the variant you add all the elements to make this a screw-your-neighbour game. Oh and this also works really good as a two player game - very cut-throat :)

Sometimes these mindless dice games are okay, but I guess this is just a bit too random and still too involved for what it easy.

Good straightforward fun. just roll dice and place them, but its entertaining , especially when players roll what they dont want.

A simple and straightforward dice game that (I've found) appeals to non-gamers greatly and doesn't overstay its welcome. I enjoy it for its clarity and effeciency. Always easy to put this one on the table and get playing.

One step up from Martian Dice, this is a very fast and very cute game in the Yahtzee style. This time you have to manage risk vs. rewards and resources (penguins). Works well with delightful components. Definitely a keeper for fast filler fun.

RATING: 5.5
It's an okay game. Dice game aren't my favourites, but it's nice and quick and has a definite end. Pretty Yahtzee like, with luck of the rolls, but a bit of strategy when deciding what to do with your rolls.

RATING: 8
Fun dice game that offers some meaningful choices. The push your luck element is very different from other light dice games and the multiple ways to score offer more depth than in similar games. It doesn't take long to teach and plays quickly. The penguins look awesome although mine have started to develop fine cracks.

RATING: 6
Very dry game, that looks better than it plays. The theme, although cute, is totally pasted on (although kudos for the Rocky & Bullwinkle joke!), and the game feels like an arbitrary luck fest with zero interaction between players (there is, however, an optional rule that seems to add a bit of interaction that I haven't tried). At least, the components are nice and the game is cheap...

RATING: 6
I played this solo. There is only one result of the dice that effects other players so I feel that the solo game is plenty to get a huge majority of what this game has to offer. I find it fun to make the decisions on the animals. It's hard to decide when to spend penguins or not. I did not get an awesome score, but I did okay. I can see this as being slightly more fun with others since you have people sweating about your results and a reason to shout out loud when you get a lucky roll. It would also be nice to steal coins from other players with the squirrel instead of from the bank. It's a cute game that I think I could teach to my youngest kids. But I would never grab it for game night.

I think this game is a great Yatzhee variant.  It takes less than 10 minutes for a 2-3 person game.  It has functional components.  It incorporates different strategies to explore.  Sure it is based on luck but the penguin mechanic gives players an opportunity to try and manage it.  What more could you want from a 10 minute game?

Pretty good little yahtzee-like game with more control for the players.  Players have the ability to add penguins through the dice and use the penguins to add dice and re-roll.  It goes pretty quick and provides a few options.  I wonder if the advanced variant would make it interesting for a group of gamers.  Probably not, but the game will work for family play.

An okay push-your-luck dice game.  Since it only lasts one round per player, you must maximize each turn.  One penguin for a total re-roll might be a bit too cheap, perhaps it should cost 2 penguins.  Down time between turns is sometimes long when people spend lots of penguins on re-rolls, especially in the last round.  Overall, it's a relatively fast, easy and enjoyable set collection game if you're in the mood for something light.

A very cute animal-themed dice roller!

This game finally ditches the old roll/reroll/reroll mechanic that is used in every single dice rolling game in existence, making you earn rerolls and extra dice.

It also has some cute animal abilities/interactions that tie in the theme a bit, which is a nice plus.

I did a demo of this game at GenCon 2012 with the creator and swapped a copy of my game, Chaos & Alchemy, for a copy of A Fistful of Penguins. I played it again later with my brother-in-law and ultimately gave the game to him since he has kids who might like it.

The basic mechanics of the game are solid enough, and the components are great (the little penguins are especially cute, and the animal dice are awesome). However, it's a bit confusing in that it looks very kid-friendly but is probably too complicated for young children. Deciding whether to count your lions for 7 points each versus spending a penguin (worth 1 point) to reroll the lions in the hope that you can count your increasing-value kangaroos... The decisions can be quite interesting, but hard for kids (or for anyone who likes to really analyze their options).

I wanted to like this so much because, well, PENGUINS, but it really feels like they ended up with a bunch of dice with random animals on them and were like, hey, what kind of game can we make with these random animals. The "moose and squirrel" combination is not enough to save the game.

RATING: 7
Great components. I like the game too - not overly taxing but hey, what do you expect?

The main problem is that because the Kangaroo strategy is too powerful, there seems little incentive to go for any other animals other than Lions, and even then only if you get bad rolls. So far the way to win seems to be: try for as many penguins as possible on rounds 1 and 2, plus maybe a few Lions in round 1 then getting a double Kangaroo in round 2. Then get all the dice in round 3 and see how many Kangaroos you can get with all the penguins to help you.

I think I shall start banning the Kangaroo chips as these just make it too easy to rely on this method and not trying to adapt to your rolls. Not that there's much skill, just to make it more varied.

A silly Yathzee-clone with an unusual press-your-luck rolling scheme. Or perhaps more accurately a boot-strapping scheme. I'm not convinced it actually [i]works[/i], though. Because there are no 'technologies' to alter what you are aiming for, your best bet seems to be to maximise the number of penguins given that you have at maximum 9 dice to eventually roll per turn. That is a problem with a fixed solution. It becomes entirely different if, as I indicated, 'technologies' are introduced.

That said, I love the execution with the laser-cut plastic penguins. The subject matter is of course silly beyond words, but thought has gone into creating a physically attractive package too. 1 rating point bonus as a consequence.

I think this would work as a fun filler or party game.  The rules are short, and are easily understood after a sample game.  Plays are fast, and there are usually enough options available on each turn to keep it from running on auto-pilot like some dice games do.

There is a variant that gives all players something to do on the active players turn.  I like that.  It's a nice touch.

The components are nice, and it all fits in a small box.  Perfect for gatherings.

If you are going to play with 5 or 6 players, the dice and penguins are going to be in short supply.  I will probably pick up a second copy and combine components into a single box.  Especially if you're going to play the advanced game (penguin chips).

Players are zoo keepers, trying to earn the most cash from their zoo.  Blindingly fast die roller - each player has three rounds of die rolling, and has to maximise their profits.  Four, five then six dice are rolled in the first, second and then final round.  After the roll, you may stop and convert your roll to cash, or spend "penguin" meeples to augment the roll in some way.  Penguins allow you to purchase more dice, re-roll some/all your dice, and so on.  The payouts based on animals are initially bewildering, but quickly become second nature.  Very fast to play once you're up to speed on the combinations ... a solo game takes literally 3 minutes.  Components range from wonderful (dice, penguins) to mediocre (cruddy plastic chip money).  Fun game, perfect for 10 minutes of mindless filler fluff.

Yahtzee-style dice game of rolling zoo animals.   You can buy dice from other players, who get to set the price in advance , so that introduces some negotiation without haggling.  Clear penguins are used for rerolls.  It's a bit too long to be a filler.  Keep in mind that players can rack up massive points in th last round if they acquire all of the dice.  Would play again a few times, but don't need to own it.

RATING: 3
The theming of A Fistful of Penguins is cute, and the various scoring methods, while too convoluted for a game of this weight, make thematic sense. Unfortunately the game is not compelling. The three rounds pass with incredible speed, and with so few dice rolls the players have very little agency in how they pursue points. Fistful of Penguins is little more than a convoluted Yahtzee variant.

Played at BayCon 2013

Kangaroos may be a little overpowered and we always play with the advance variant where each player has a dice that you may buy off them.

There is a good amount of interaction and a fair few decisions to make on your turn but turns are still fairly quick.

Component quality is  good, would have been dice if the dice were a little larger and the chips a bit better quality but the penguin-meeples are nice, and the summary cards provide all the information you require.

Having played this however I no longer feel the need to own it.

RATING: 4
A reasonably enjoyable light filler dice game.  Some comments:

1. It doesn't seem to hit the sweet spot for any target audience. It looks like a kid's game, but it's too mathy and tactical for youngsters, but a little too shallow for many adults.

2. There doesn't seem to be a dominant strategy. A lot of it depends upon what you roll. This is good.

3. Despite #2, kangaroos are always involved in extremely high scores if you can get the right rolls. So early penguins are important, increasing the luck factor.

4. Don't bother with the "advanced" rules. Really.

5. Theoretically, the start player is at a disadvantage because subsequent players can account for their score and adjust their level of risk-taking appropriately. In practice, it's not an issue. It's a filler game, so no one really bothers.

6. Works fine as a solo game. In fact, the multiplayer version basically feels like multiplayer solitaire.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2014)

Very simple rolling dice game. Sadly I played with the full complement of players so the game was very slow and had lots of downtime. I think it is best with 3 or 4 players. With more the game can be very long for such a simple game.

Lots of luck but in a (supposedly) short game I don’t mind much. Paper-thin theme.

It has great components (which attracted me in the first place) and great player aids. The scoring system is novel and welcome but I’m worried the Kangaroos are overpowered. Still (again) I don’t mind much in such a simple game.

Bottom line, I would play the game from time to time if requested. I think I will sell my copy but I’m still not 100% sure about this. I need to try it with 3 players and with the advanced rules.

I'm a sucker for dice games, even ones that just don't work simply because I love chucking dice.  That being said, A Fistful of Penguins is successful at being a bit more than just a Yahtzee clone.  I'm not saying there's a huge amount of strategy however, you are somewhat in control of your own destiny since you're able to purchase extra rolls and extra dice.  Every once in awhile, you might get unlucky due to bad dice rolls, but in the meantime, you're going to be playing a pretty fun little dice game.

01-08-2016 - Got it for my sister who  isn't really a gamer, but she loves penguins.  I thought it might be a fun game for her since it's not real rules heavy and it's cute as a button.  Gameplay isn't too bad for what the game is, a quick push-your-luck-fest, but it's not one I'll run to.  I really hope she likes it.  For me, I'll give it a 5.

The right amount of light hearted fun with great components.   I mean animal dice, and penguin meeples, how awesome is that?    Be warned this is a good filler game, and it does not try to be anything more.   Find a way to organize/contain the chips better and you have a great quikie game.

MMM. I probably don't want to play this again.

I feel that there are zero decisions in the game because you can can calculate all your moves and you are dependant on diceroolls which makes it rather pointless to put too much effort in playing the best option. Most options have a +side and a downside.

It's well produced. but I really don't see the game.

Right after King of Tokyo this feels a bit bland. This one is a filler as well, but there aren't that many levels and if it's not your turn all you can do is just watch what the others are doing... I wasn't that impressed, but if someone suggests it, I would join for sure.

Composite game adaption quotes: "I played the other day with 4 players, advanced rules, NO kangaroo tokens. Other 3rd turn strategies emerged other than 'get lots of penguins and a double kangaroo and go for 81 points.' It was nice. I don't think I'll ever play any other way.""If it feels scripted, try the first penguin die = one penguin token, every additional penguin die = 2 tokens. Also, we sometimes play that having one of each animal at scoring = 25 point bonus."

Frustratingly shallow luck driven dicer.  Nice pieces and kids quite like, but essentially empty.  Given that anyone who manages to grab a slew of penguins on round 2 will walk the game regardless, and the game has little or no variability, its a peculiarly pointless box to take out.  Although simplicity of rules appeals to 6-8 year olds, which is no bad thing (but then so does Smallworld, an entirely more substantial game).  And did I mention fiddly?

RATING: 6
Fun dice game, with a heavy push-your-luck element that works out pretty well.

PROS
- Easy to explain and learn. Suitable for almost everyone.
- Very nice components.
- While the Advanced mode makes it more interesting if you're playing a lot, advanced gamers may have fun just with the Basic mode.

CONS
- It isn't super interactive (while the Advanced mode fixes this if you feel like having to fix it).
- The strategy, obviously, is quite limited as it is luck-driven. More fun than thinking in here.

I spent a whole weekend playing this with a special person, so my personal opinion may be biased (I really enjoyed that weekend). I guess that means that it works nicely with just 2 people. Just a fun game when you don't feel like thinking a lot.

I was looking for a filler when this hit the table at an open gaming session. I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed how this game worked. The pieces are also very nice. In essence, this is a push-your-luck dice game but one with a fair bit of strategy as well as luck involved.

The theme is delightful and one that I think primary school aged children would enjoy, that said, I played it with half a dozen adults and we had a ball.

As luck would have it I had pledged on the Wattsalpoag Games kickstarter for Buccaneer Bones and played this the day after it ended. I liked A Fistful of Penguins so much that I have contacted Wattsalpoag Games to see if I can add a copy to my pledge. If not, then this is one I’ll look out for with a view to purchase. An overall good game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another simple dice roller but this is one of the better ones and has a cute factor out the wazoo. The dice feature different animals on each face and it is the combination of animals that will determine how many points can be earned. 

Underlying the scoring is the ability to earn penguin meeple, which are very cute, as these allow re-rolls to be taken in order to maximise a player's score.

The 3 rounds are over in the blink of an eye (10-15) minutes and a good time is generally had by all.

Well worth picking up for the asking price.

Sure, it's rolling dice in a push-your-luck-fest... But the combinations take it beyond simple dice-rolling.  Lots of fun if you don't take it too seriously!

Penguins can be traded in to have another go at sorting out your menagerie, while kangaroos just bring in more kangaroos.  The elusive moose-and-squirrel combo is the only way to annoy others (although it's subtle at best), and camels are easy money until you get a lion.  Lions are hard, but good money.
If you run out of penguins you're stuck with what you've rolled, which might be utterly worthless.

RATING: 6.4
Very simple game with nice dice and penguin meeples, very simple rules and fast gameplay.

My biggest issue with this game is that there's no interaction, you just do 3 rolls and compare your results. Offturns are boring. Even if the game last 15-20 minutes, it feels long.

The advanced variant should deal with this issue at the cost of making the game a bit longer. I have not played it, but it should be fine, as long as the players are not allowed to negotiate or think too much about the price.

Forget about the base version and play the advanced variant by default!

RATING: 7
The best components of the show (Essen 2011), by a clear margin.

RATING: 4.5
Fistful of Penguins is a rather complex dice filler. The dice show different animals on their faces, and the players try to collect scoring combos over several rounds. Some animals don't get on together (lions tend to eat the others) and it is possible to buy re-rolls, so there is quite a bit of re-rolling each turn. The dice are pretty, but not as well done as Martian Dice. The highlight of the package are some transparent plastic penguins.

All in all - it was OK. There is more control than usual for this kind of game, and something to think about on your turn, but it is all very light weight.

RATING: 7
You get three shots at rolling the dice, making as many points as you can by getting various combinations. The neat aspect is the penguin system, where you can spend penguins to re-roll dice or introduce more dice. But of course you only have so many penguins to last you over the 3 rolls. So do I use them now or later? And if you roll penguins on the dice, do you kill those dice to get more penguins or just re-roll them for points instead? It's massively over-produced for a simple dice game, but the decisions on what to keep, buy and re-roll make it a pleasant way of passing 15 minutes.

Push-your-luck game that tries to pretend it has more going on than Can't Stop, which makes it more deplorable.

There is basically only one viable strategy, the only time the game becomes interesting is if everyone fails to roll into it first round.

Strange little game - for a fairly basic dice-chucker, there are an awful lot of rules and combinations here. Probably won't replace Martian Dice or Zombie Dice, both of which are much cleaner, but I suspect this could be a little deeper. But then one doesn't play this kind of game for depth, so it feels a little stuck in no-man's land. And I've only ever played it once, way back in 2012.

RATING: 6
The quality of the game components is great, e.g. the penguins look like colored glass. It's a dice rolling game that offers some tactics: For example I may buy additional dice, re-roll a set of dice, take away victory points from the other players. There are different ways to achieve  a high amount of victory points that also may exclude each other, e.g. a rolled lion nullifies all other types of rolled animals. It's a fun, short tactical dice game.

IOS IPAD version. Like this one. Quick and easy to learn.

UPDATE:

Now have physical version (from the wonderful Spirit Games). Nice Penguin tokens, shame the money tokens are just plain plastic coloured chips.

However, not going down well with others I've introduce this to. main issue is potentially long wait time between turns and the scoring system for each animal.

Thus as a solo game this would be a solid 7, however as it will be hard to get this to the table often, I'm afraid the rating will be adjusted accordingly.

2016 UPDATE:

Transfered out for resonable fee via EBay... Will keep playing on IPAD

Those little penguins are awesome and the game, despite it's very simple rules, works very well! 

Very enjoyable filler -- wouldn't mind having a copy!

--- Summary (Advanced Game) ---
Players each start with $10 and some penguins. On your turn, roll a bunch of dice while the other players roll a single die secretly, and set a price. On your turn you either cash out just your penguin dice (for penguins; triangular growth) or all your dice (various combinations are worth different amounts of money, mostly from the bank but possibly from other players), buy other people's dice, or spend a penguin to either buy an available die (if any; 3 rounds, with 3/2/1 available dice in subsequent rounds) OR to reroll any of your dice. The player with the most money at the end wins!

[b]Basic Game[/b] (original comment)

Dull little game in the Yahtzee roll/re-roll style. Each die has a different animal on each face; re-rolling them requires expending a penguin token, requiring you to roll more penguins to obtain more tokens. Other combinations score differently according to various unnecessarily complicated rules: camels score 5, unless you have a lion; squirrels score n + n-1 + ... + 0 for n squirrels, stolen from the succeeding players in turn. Moose score nothing on their own; moose and squirrel together get 9. There's also some business with kangaroos and kangaroo tokens to get your head around.

It's got none of the simple charm of a Pickomino or the depth of a Roll Through the Ages. Luck-heavy gameplay, big downtime with more players and tediously opaque scoring -- what's not to like?? :zombie:

4/10

--

[b]Advanced Game[/b] (update)

I had only played the basic game, having been told that the advanced version added nothing but length. Aaargh, what a waste!

The advanced version gives each other player a die, which they roll and use to set a price. The active player can buy a die as normal with a penguin, or from another player at cost. This is particularly interesting in the final round when there will be no spare dice in the pool at all and your friendly competitors have suddenly acquired a rather predatory look...

There's still a lot of luck, but this variant adds a game to an otherwise tedious waste of time. It gets deliciously extortionate and makes the whole experience infinitely more engaging for everyone.

A cute light dice rolling game. There are six different animals, each giving you different amounts of money or something unique. Penguins earn you tokens which you can use to get more dice, or re-roll existing ones. Squirrels take money from the other players. Lions get money but eat all your other animals except penguins. Camels get you money, but only if there are no Lions. 

And my favourite, Moose and Squirrel gets you money if they are paired up.

For the price, this game is a great value.  The penguins are acrylic and the dice are imprinted, so even if the chips are a little boring, the rest of the game shines.  The game itself, though, is a little dull.  I like that it's something other than "Roll three times and see what your best option is with what you have," but it also becomes a game where players can just keep spending penguins and re-rolling dice to get what they want.  I guess that's good, but I think push-your-luck games succeed on not being quite so open, and putting restrictions on what you can do on a given turn.  Plus, the kangaroo tokens seem odd, in that you get the option of possibly getting a game-changing roll based on how well you roll on a previous round.  I'd be interested in trying it without the chips just to see how they compare.  Still, the game lacks an appreciable tension, and I don't think removing the kangaroo tokens will do much to correct that issue.

Etwas anspruchsvollerer Absacker. Die Beziehungen zwischen den gewürfelten Tieren sind erst mal etwas unübersichtlich. Aber das macht auch den reiz aus. Gehe ich auf die Löwen, die viel Geld bringen, kann ich keine anderen Tiere mehr werten.

Stark ist die Pinguin und Känguru Strategie. In den ersten beiden Runden auf Pinguine gehen und auf jeden Fall in der zweiten Runde den Känguru Chip holen. Dafür reucht auch ein Känguru. Dann hat man ganz viele Versuche in der letzten Runde um alle Würfel zu kaufen und möglichst viele Kängurus zu würfeln.

Klappt zum Glück nur gelegentlich, weil manchmal einfach die Pinguine fehlen.

This game was a hit in Essen this year. It was sold out on Thursday already. We saw it back there, but it was very crowdy, and not possible to play. When we had the opportunity today, we grabbed it immediatly. Probably we will never do that again. This game is 100% pure luck. You just have to score as many penguins in the 1st round and then try to collect as many kangaroos in the next 2 rounds. The components are pretty nice, but not fantastic or even great. We don’t understand why people are so crazy about this one. Only nice to play if you’re at a gaming club, waiting to join in a game with other players and want to stay busy playing games.

Best thing about this game? The artwork on the box is fantastic!

After 2+ plays: There's probably only 1 or 2 viable paths to victory, but it at least seems like you have interesting options, and it only lasts as long as it should.

Quite a simple dice throwing game.

Würfelspiel mit Tieren, das zuerst etwas kompliziert wirkt (man muss etwas rechnen), aber durch die vielen möglichen Kombos an Kniffel erinnert.

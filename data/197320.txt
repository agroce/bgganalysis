More streamlined than Mythotopia for sure, gone are the silly random scoring cards. The developments tableau is a nice addition, some techs seem a little imbalanced, the starting randomized civs are a cheap way to add variety and seem to work well. Thematically its bland but mechanically sound, reserving cards seems very important, players are rewarded to work through their decks faster relative to other players which also advances the end game conditions - a nice balance. Wormholes, stealth movement, and any other tech that allows you to increase mobility seems to be especially important on the constrained point-to-point map where movement is naturally inefficient. I think I miss the A Few Acres of Snow/Mythotopia style of movement though, where you need the location card to activate units for movement, here you just spend energy points from any card.

Only one play with a pre-production copy. I did enjoy it very much with deck building well integrated into the game design. The way the board is set up is very clever with "blackholes" blocking passages and random planets scattered. The only hold back I have is it feels like the best strategy (again, after only a single play!) is to build up a large fleet and smash into your opponents. This is tempered by requiring an energy to move each token, but if you can come in with overwhelming force, you'll not lose any ships - and can march along pretty much unencumbered (pacifist race notwithstanding). However, if you're looking for a smashingly fun space combat game with far smarter mechanics than other games of that ilk, this may be the one for you.

Lots to like in this game, with good mechanisms that plays well. After one play just a little concerned that the setup is so random, which can deal players a very strong or weak starting position... but perhaps that should rightly be mitigated by the way the players play (in 3 or 4 player anyway). Also not keen on the ending, the end game with all point on show leads to a strong bash the leader ending, with the last player to play known from the start of the game. I'd prefer a guillotine ending. But still, fun multi-player deckbuilder. I prefer Time of Crisis though :)

RATING: 6
Seems well designed and interesting enough as a space battle game driven by a deck building engine.  For those who love space wars, territorial/planetay conquest, deck building, and "take that" card effects, this might be just the game for you.  

For me, this is simply not the kind of game I am interested in playing any longer. Been there, done that enough times.  I am more interested in fresher mechanics, themes, and/or goals that manage to be fun to play around with.

Martin has nailed it. He's been working around the edges of hybrid deckbuilder games for a while now, and here it seems the systems have balanced most elegantly. Doesn't completely obsolete Mythotopia, but sits alongside it - a slicker, faster game that shows this system can be dynamic and rangy, as well as a WW1 style slugfest.

RATING: 9
I like the theme and artwork.

Setup is a bit involved; 15 minutes or so. Virtual versions of the game benefit greatly from automated setup.

The gameplay itself is pretty streamlined.

The game length depends heavily on the players and how long they spend in analysis paralysis. I'd recommend new players just choose actions quickly, at random if necessary, and not change their minds; get through more turns to see how actions work out to get experience.

The rulebook looks nice but contains some mistakes and confusing text. After reading the rules and reading comments from the game designer the intended rules are fairly intuitive, but would be hard to understand from just the manual. The rulebook could use a rewrite based on testing it out with new players and seeing how they actually interpret the wording.

I had the privilege of trying this game at SPIEL this year, and it is already one of my favorite Martin Wallace titles. The deckbuilding works really well, Det board is randomized for each game, creating immense replayability, and the different races each bring something unique to the gameplay. Only minor complaint is the names of the races, which are very generic, like Peacemogs, Aggronors, but that has no impact on the game and can easily be ignored.

RATING: 7.5
This is an advanced deckbuilder that has well-tuned card play. Turns move fast, combat is resolved quickly, and players can accelerate to the end game if they want to. Players can draft cards to further their strategy or to block an opponent. The development tiles add another welcome dose of strategy and tactics. The game's variation in setup and card effects inject an interesting amount of chaos into each play. The game leaves it up to the players to overcome the chaos. Add in the different alien races and you have a game that, assuming you enjoy its game play, can be played again and again without feeling stale. I should also note that the art and graphic design are well done. The player boards would be more usable if they were a bit bigger. I want more space between the various card piles. 

Still, the directness (or simplistic nature) of the board's game play is in contrast to the more nuanced card play. For example, with the streamlined combat and point-to-point movement, the board play comes close to feeling primarily like militarized route-building, as opposed to a game of sci-fi conquest.

There is a skill curve to the game. The skill curve is largely due to the ability to reserve cards, the game's end condition being a shuffle counter, and the potential to both build and thin your deck. You will need a few plays to improve your deck management--and proper deck management ups the tension and pace of the game. Improper deck management can cause a long delay in triggering the end condition, so beginners may find the game lasts longer than they want. 

The rule book is passable, but it is a bit inconsistent in its perspective. For example, the building action is written as a basic rule that can be broken by certain cards, but the retreat action is written in a generic way that accounts for the different card effects. Even with those very minor flaws, as long as one person is familiar with the rules, you can get into a game pretty easily. After the first play, the board state starts to feel more digestible -- the set up that drops you into an existing empire makes it a bit difficult to understand how the board flows for the first play.

Edit, Nov. 2017: After a few more plays, there is some additional complexity in the board play due to the asymmetries in the alien races. Each race's presence on the board changes the game flow subtlety and each race's variation has a strong effect on a player's strategy. This is another strength of the game.

RATING: 5.5
First Play: Played with another experienced player who explained the rules (total 4p). Very similar to A Few Acres of Snow but with a random board set up. The early skill seems to be to read this set up with regard to where your bases are and the juxtaposition with opponents and blocking black holes. This also seems a significant weakness. This set up can give some players space to easily defend and to expand into. Others will be split and cheek by jowl with other players with no open expansion space. The ability to take green planets means you will churn through the colony disks, gaining points and permanent benefits. If you have access to none, then this plain won't happen.

Sure the initial advantage might result in these guys being picked on but in our game the best initially positioned players ended up in 1st & 2nd place.

I'm also not keen on the very obvious need to whack the current leader and the possibility of King making at game end when the 20th redraw is completed and one player is the last to go.

Somehow seems a game with too many lose ends.

I enjoyed Mythotopia, whose variable setup and ability-granting regions made the game more tactical and interesting than A Few Acres of Snow. So I thought I would love this. Unfortunately, I was not a big fan. 

Principally, I didn't like the wide spread of values for the NPC defense tokens, some of which can be easily taken with a 1 or 2 defense, while others may have an additional 8 or 9 defense and take far more effort to conquer. 

Similarly, I didn't like how certain techs and tokens make conquest easy, while other players are forced to lose units to expand. This means that some players can, within the first 3 or 4 turns of the game, fall well behind other players both in victory points and in special abilities, which can be near-impossible to recover from. 

I'm unsure whether better play can easily mitigate a bad/unlucky starting position, but to me it seems too strong a predictor of victory for me to want to try.

Ok, 1 play so far.  Need to play again, but may fall more likely than rise.  With 4, at least the learning game, the down-time was atrocious.  Martin keeps tying to fit his AFOS model into multi-player, and I am not sure its fitted for that.  It is a giant tug-of-war, in which all lose, and at times, it is hard to find a move that will help you.

A couple plays in, eh, it's ok. To echo some of the other comments somewhat, the game is mechanically competent, but is sort of stale and uninspiring.

As far as the actual deckbuilding goes, there are no real synergies to achieve, you just buy a few techs here and there and either plop them into your reserve and/or hope they come up at the right time. Compare that with [i]Acres[/i] where you can tailor your deck towards combat, development or raiding. You actually feel your card decisions affecting your overall game plan in a very significant way as you work towards specific objectives. Here, not so much, as you basically just sort of pinball into each other.

On top of that, the cost of the techs strikes me as inconsistent in terms of actual usefulness. There's a little bit of deck thinning, but mostly you just use combat as a way to cycle through your deck as quickly as possible.

The overall game play, along with the VP system, felt rather coarse. Because there are no hidden VP's, the net result is that no one gets a lead for long. Given competent players, you'll probably see very tight games won by whoever happens to go last because they know precisely how much they need to win. Then there's the potentially unfun situation with the random setup which could hose you. Lastly, the game is a little too long for what it offers.

Still, it's not terrible. The special cards for each race are a nice touch, and the artwork is good. I wouldn't necessarily refuse a game if someone really wants to give it a go. But, for multi-player deckbuilders I'd rather play [i]Tyrants of the Underdark[/i] over this if I'm looking for something wargamey, or [i]Clank[/i] if I'm in the mood for something light.

Verdict: it's a game.

The mechanics are great and produce a whole swathe of difficult and interesting decisions and possible strategies. 'Reading' the board and assessing the synergies between your deck and faction abilities and tech cards available present a challenging game.

I am a bit concerned that it may run a bit too long - all 3 games so far have take 4 hours - all included first time players so that time will come down but I can't see it going under 3 hours. Playing time is under 3 hours for players who have played before - so that's OK.

2017-09-06 : First play. The final iteration of the A Few Acres of Snow. Graphics and components are pretty good, but the theme is so generic and the mechanics so similar that the result is a game that is not feeling new and fresh anymore. It's one of those games that you play and are glad you played it, but there's little incentive to play it again.

A great combination of deck-building and are control. Usually I'm not a fan of area-control especially with 2 players, but in this game I like it. The artwork in the game is great, each planet has it's own artwork and each looks interesting in it's own way. 

The variable setup is amazing as it was the biggest complaint I had about A Few Acres of Snow. The technology cards are interesting, I like that some break the rules and really shake the game up. 

The only downside of the game was the length. Maybe it's only a problem with 2 players but I felt it was just a few turns too long. Next game I would play to 12 or maybe even 10 shuffles. 

Beside that one criticism it is a great game with intuitive rules, great theme and fun gameplay.

Typical Wallace - rule book a mess (what do you do with the VP markers and how do you apply VP on cards at end (must be in reserve I assume)?), pieces missing, great first half of game which now seems to end too soon (the opposite of Mythopia), a card that seems too powerful (diplomacy with a thin deck makes you impossible to attack) a really poor visual design (black hole markers on black background and simply a terrible scoring track) - and yet, I want to play it again.  (Rating 6.728, Jan 18). UPDATE: Ok, game two was much more engaging and quite different (different roles, no wormhole appearance, all players now understand the arc of the game).  Further, interpreting the Diplomacy card that it can only be played immediately at start of combat (so just send one fleet to tease it out) seems to be a better approach.  Still long (3hrs) and complex (for me) but it was definitely engrossing despite the fact I will never to good at this game (Rating 7.619, Jan 18).

Early rating.  I really like the game, but it is a tough one.  The rules are often unclear and really needed an outside editor.  The game itself is very good but VERY thinky.  With only two actions per turn, there is a lot of angst over spending an action without an obvious gain.  I don't think I like the wormholes: there are so many of them, they are not obvious on the tiles and easily covered, and they connect too many places all together.  Still, there was a lot to think about and enjoy.

(Comment after only 1 play, will hopefully change)

Oh, A Handful of Stars, how great my hopes for thou were! I waited for you, I longed for you, and I saw in you my next potential soulmate. Despite its flaws, your eldest brother, A few acres of snow, was a beauty of design and theme meshed together, a rare occurrence.

The deckbuilding mechanic is still enjoyable and requires careful planning. However, I missed two things compared to AfAoS which make me rate AHoS much lower for now:

- Due to the number of players (I played with 4), it's much harder to pace yourself. The temptation is great to defend yourself straight away as a bad start puts you in a terrible spot for the rest of the game. This is compounded by the second effect.

- Why oh why was the mechanic of having to play a card from the start location removed? In AfAoS, this really meant that you had to conquer locations on the path you wanted to take and required considerable map awareness, making the immersion all the greater. In AHos, it seemed much more situational and you try to expand in all directions to gather resources and colonies.

I'll definitely give it another shot because I can't believe the successor of AfAoS fails on these important aspects and also because the experience wasn't bad after all. There is however great disappointment and, if it doesn't fare better, I will put in on the trade list with regret.

RATING: N/A
This is going to take more than 1x play to get a handle on (and get to a rating). Mainly I love the mechanical innovations here that address many of the typical shortcomings of deckbuilders: development tokens to fill-in those little gaps between cards in hand, reserve spots trading off expanded hand size against upgrades, holding cards in hand from turn to turn, and consolation/mitigation for losing territory by thinning your deck. These are important improvements in the deckbuilder state of the art.

The race design is very minimalistic—each is just 3 cards out of 17 at the start—and yet feels surprisingly strong over the course of the game. And there's more: black holes change the layout dramatically, upgrades can create very asymmetrical engines, minor but critically important rounding differences in the combat system for attacker/defender create interesting dangers/opportunities, and so on. It's a lovely, elegant design.

The timing aspects of players' decks are really interesting, too. Knowing where a player is in their shuffle becomes quite important (especially for playing against the Aggroids—end of his shuffle means an attack with a Star Bomb is likely!). More than once, players in our first game got down to the last card in their deck without triggering a shuffle, which was disastrous to their plan. Oops! The use of deck shuffles as a game timer is also critical to watch near the end of the game. Good play in this game appears to be all about timing, timing, timing.

I'm less thrilled with Wallace's sci-fi theming, and if there's one thing holding the game back IMHO, it's this. Despite the awesome potential (great name, cool cover), the theme is fairly pasted on, and Wallace doesn't take any extra pains to create immersion. 

For example, the aggressive race is called the Aggroids, the builders are the Bilderoids, then Peacenims, and so on. It's convenient and usable, but if you're going to go with sci-fi as a theme, something more compelling is key. In the end, it's perfectly serviceable and has its good points, but it doesn't really go beyond that. With such a beautiful set of mechanisms powering the game, a weak theme is a huge lost opportunity.

The game is long, at least when learning, so I don't know how often this will get to the table, but as a design I really love it and if that's something that resonates with you, it definitely should be experienced.

Initial impression: smoothed over all of he rough parts of Wallace's earlier attempts at the format in Snow/Myth. The reserves worked way better, the technology cards had more impact and felt well balanced, and the colony/development chit system worked wonderfully to reward expansion and balance the risk of a bad draw.  Some people may not like that there is a lot of room for player advantages with the random start (planets, technology, races, and every combination between) but I haven't seen any issues and like hat it protects against a power player dominating from the start.  This is the definitive Wallace area control deckbuilder.

RATING: 7.5
It looks like Wallace finally got it right, mostly. Gone are the quagmires of Mythotopia--combat is fast and dynamic, and getting attacked no longer makes you easier prey to another player. The techs are fun and the place names/race names are hilariously bad (as intended). Rating might rise.
[EDIT] Parsing the board, and hence figuring out where the pressure points are, is vastly easier on a second play (unlike other games, like Eclipse, where I still get surprised by the dead ends I've made for myself after many plays). That's a great sign.

First impressions after 1 play:

- Setup is longish, but not complicated.
- Rules are (very) manageable and mostly consistent.
- It seems very strategic.
- The randomness due to the deck-building is mitigated (you may like that or not) due to the several places resources come from: from your hand (6 cards, sometimes more), your reserve (0-4+ cards), your development counters (2-8). All these you can use on your turn, meaning that you often have many diverse resources available for your actions. In other words: you hand doesn't give you *that* much direction as it may give you in other deck-builders ("ah, I drew those 5 cards, so only these 2 actions make sense in this turn"); no, often it's viable to do any of the possible actions. Of course, for a major strike or to get the best technology card on display, you have to prepare your turn (via reserve or holding cards back in your hand).
- Combat: pretty good, tug-of-war style. Combat rules are the most complex in the game, but still make sense and should be understood after one or two combats. Some minor exceptions here and there.
- Play time: rather long. 45m-60m per player, I would guess.
- Production quality is (very) good. Printed it Germany, the tokens are very sturdy, the board is thick with a linen-finish, and all colors in general very crisp. Minor complaint: some counters are only printed on one side, which decreases usability a bit. Biggest complaint: the cards are only okay, e.g. with no linen-finish.

Seen at SPIEL16/Essen. Watched people play for 5 minutes, talked to Martin Wallace.

Was pleasantly surprised by the looks of the board. Much nicer than I remembered it from BGG. A game based on the core deck-building and conflict/battle mechanism from A Few Acres of Snow. But in space (+-0 for me, I also like the historic theme very much) and for 4(?) players (a huge ++ for me). Looks pretty complex with advancements markers (techs?) etc. Will it have a 3/4x feel? So many questions.

Also the artwork is done by the artist behind Among the Stars. He diverged just enough so that it's not immediately obvious, but if you looks closely you recognize it. As I like his style, this can only benefit the game.

RATING: 7.5
A Handful of Stars is an involving deckbuilder/weuro from Martin Wallace, who is familiar with both.

The setup and initial conditions are quite random, but certainly in a three player game the players will be thrown against each other in interesting ways.

Worlds are randomly scattered, randomly assigned, and then players choose what seems to be their best starting positions.

Black holes and wormholes are also fairly randomly placed, based on the planetary locations.

At least in my game that didn't prevent cluture clash, players pushing their racial advantages, and very close play.

The shuffle count timer for game end and the random setup aside, this seems a well balanced game, not prone to any consistent geographic advantages, and was both reasonably quick and fun to play.

Initial rating based on the demo game I played with friends during Essen Spiel 2016 with instructions from M. Wallace himself.

Although some game pieces were still prototypes the board and cards artwork seemed final and looked awesome.

The rules were clear (but all of us were used to A Few Acres of Snow, Mythotopia or A Study in Emerald), the player turn is quite simple and the mechanics are easy to learn.
They are enough available actions to play different styles and to adapt to each situation but not so much as to get you lost and wondering what to do.

Also, the game builds on previous M. Wallace "deck building" games he proposes some interesting tweaks.

It's got a decent system but my play was rather joyless. The deckbuilding aspect lacked the cool combo potential of other deckbuilders, so it's not really about action efficiency except hopefully being able to build 2 ships instead of 1. The tech market got clogged with crap after all the good stuff was snatched up and was ignored from the midgame on. Mostly it was just turns of either building or raiding, where victory came down to who happened to have the right special card in hand.

I don't generally care about visuals, but the presentation here is SO GOOD. The individual art for the planets & alien races is just lovely.

Mechanically, it's much better than Mythotopia, and much simpler than a Few Acres of Snow. The combat mechanics are fantastic - lose 1/2 rounded down if you win, and 1/2 rounded up if you lose. So big fleets shrink quickly, and balancing energy with mass to produce those ships is tremendously rough.

The reserve feature finally becomes the central feature it always tried to be in previous games. Tech drafting is lovely, asymmetrical aliens are really interesting and matter a lot, and the scattered board positions at start create tense decisions and interesting mechanics.

I even love the way game length is determined by shuffles. You can play for a longer or shorter game, depending on how you use resources, and manage your draws. And every turn has just a few options - meaninful, but not overwhelming. The game (mostly) clips along at a nice pace.

An exceptionally beautiful and thoughtful game that unfortunately fails to feel fresh.
The artist, Odysseas Stamoglou, deserves an award!

The mechanics present here are solid and thoughtful... and yet the gameplay they engender is repetitive and stale.   There's no secret sauce baked in that brings the rules to life or grants thematic excitement to player actions.   
Expanding your empire feels more like a chore to grab a few extra VP than an exciting acquisition.  Skirmishes with your neighbors feel like obnoxious attrition instead of intense jousts.   There's just no sense of drama or narrative here.
Even inter-player politics are constrained and empty.   The only real social dynamic that springs to life is a bash the leader kerfuffle as players enter endgame.

Played for the first time we four players. Everyone is looking forward to playing it again soon. It took about 30 minutes to set-up and explain the rules. After about five turns,players started to get a better grasp of the rules and play of the game and the pace picked-up. With the choices of the various actions and the inexperience of the players, our first play had a number of serious cases of Analysis Paralysis. I am looking forward to playing it again.

(+) Achieves a streamlined 4x (3x?) feel, likely due to the "explore" portion starting out more defined.  
(+) All the mechanisms just -work-. The cards and assymetrical races present clever and subtle synergies, while still feeling like the deck-building does not take precedence over the main board's area contest. Battle plays out seamlessly, and reserve cards are a brilliant concept that gives you a sense of growing strength and forward planning for a decisive turn.  
(+) Stunningly beautiful artwork.  

(-) Runs a bit long, especially at 4p. 
(-) Randomized set-up of starting positions can result in some unbalance.  
(-) Somewhat limited card variety.

Wow ! Une fois de plus Martin Wallace nous offre un jeu fluide complexe avec une très grande rejouabilité et un graphisme pas dégueu.
Les règles sont simples et efficaces, les possibilités sont multiples et le jeu est cadré dans la temporalité.
Je le conseille à tous les amoureux de science-fiction, aux fans de deck building et à tous ceux qui ont aimé les jeux de Martin Wallace.

A Few Acres of Snow, 3.0, in space?

RATING: 6
The deckbuilding element in this game is brilliant, but if you take that away all that remains is a pretty basic multiplayer wargame. There are no means to get victory points and to win the game except via area control (except some lame technology cards with a victory point number that clog up your reserve). 

Also I find the game overstays its welcome: Often the fronts are hardened already when you still have hours(!) to play, making it a boring war of attrition. The game encourages you to attack the weakest player (who just spent all his combat cards / developments and still lost that decisive battle), especially because the non-player aliens are sometimes too tough to beat.

Another thing I don't like: The available technology cards do not cycle between turns. So if the players are not interested in the available techs then they stay there forever. This happened a lot during my plays. We since house ruled this so that after each reshuffle, one of the tech cards gets removed and another one is drawn. Amazing how this is not an official rule in the game.

I like the deckbuilding and hand management in this game, but overall the game is mediocre. I much prefer Eclipse and Forbidden Stars.

Typical example of a Martin Wallace game that desperately needs more game development (not performed by the designer himself).

The best implementation of the system originally seen in A Few Acres. I’m not crazy about the completely random setup but otherwise, this is very smooth and simple and works very well.

The best of the three simply because it cuts out the crap, and keeps conflict as a high priority, and easy to resolve. Not without issues though, and how the rulebook and cards got through proofreading I'll never know.

Easily the best of Wallace's trilogy of hybrid deck-builders. It's got the player count of Mythotopia but none of its (considerable) problems. Which means it's faster, leaner, and a whole lot more streamlined. Perhaps even a little too streamlined, but that's the price of precision.

Provisional rating, one play, 3p.  I like many things about this design. I find the components much prettier than A Few Acres of Snow, and though I love the space theme I miss the historical setting of that game.  However, I'm only interested in playing something this conflict-heavy as a head-to-head between two people or, better, two teams. I might increase my rating if I find AHoS shines with two.

It's a delightfully aggressive deck-building game. The random system placement is sure to cause problems, and I'd advise drafting starting planets instead of a random draw.

Streamlined--in a good way!--evolution of Wallace's system first revealed in A Few Acres of Snow.  Handful of Stars strips away some of the thematic and mechanical chrome in favour of a faster-playing and more dynamic game.  Decisions are still meaningful, combat is swift and tense, and the technologies on offer are thematically coherent and fun; but it feels (after initial plays) that there's a greater focus on conflict leading to victory rather than empire-building through culture.  This is a better introduction by virtue of its ease of play to the deck-building system than Acres, Mythotopia or other spin-offs like Hands in the Sea.

Played once. Interesting to be sure. The opinion of the group is that there are too many blackholes. In fact, the draw resulted in half my planets being more or less surrounded by them which seriously cramped my ability to interact with other players. Seriously thinking of restricting blackholes and also thinking up a new way of deploying the planets initially as it's just too random.

[i]Maya[/i] has simple rules, some challenges, and a unique theme. It is also finicky and fiddly. There are some interesting moves to guarantee scoring in more valuable pyramids, but overall the game doesn't rise above itself.

RATING: 6
{1 play • 3 players} Initial rating: 7. There's basically nothing new here, but somehow all the various old mechanics fit together in a way that's quite interesting... for now.  I suspect the lack of "freshness" will result in a very short shelf life (or rather a very long life on the shelf) down the line.  Rating will probably drop after more play (especially with a 5-player game, I bet). [after a 5-player game] Wow, I wish someone would have taken that bet:)  Rating dropped a full point with five players.  Way too much downtime/analysis for what it is, and, even worse, it seems fairly impossible to come back from behind with five.  If you get hosed position-wise, it's not only hard to regain position, but no else really has much insentive to help you.

I actually liked this game quite a bit.  The game falls into that super filler category.  Its not sophisticated enough to be a true heavy weight and its too long to be just a filler.  As such, you need to approach it with the time needed to play and the lightness of less heady games.  But you can't be too casual or you'll miss the game for what it can offer.  Game play is almost entirely area control with timing playing a key factor.  The game is very well balanced with interesting interactions between the elements.  Likely underrated.

RATING: 7.5
Like many Abacus games, this won't challenge the classic game designs, but not giving it a chance will probably mean you will miss out on an entertaining, clever and undervalued game.

p: I wish this game would come out more often as it does - for a quick 45 minutes it offers far more than it gets given credit for. Sure, there is nothing very original here, as all mechanisms appear elsewhere in one form or other, but sometimes originality is taking known blocks and building exciting new buildings with it. And that it does very well indeed. Remarkably well considering this is the designer's first published design.

Timing the placement of your blocks is very important, even more so when there are bonus blocks to be earned by completing levels. There are wonderful levelling factors built into the mechanism and games usually stay quite tight. Having different boards for different player amounts makes the scalability question nearly obsolete. 

The way semi-blind bidding for (influence over) actions and building stones is resolved is outstanding. I have become a big fan of mechanisms that determine actions and income through bidding. Especially if that offers the option to spread your influence over available actions wide, or target a single action by adding to your initial bid at the obvious cost. But if there is a strategy that hides a sting in the tail for others, and the -3 bidding card here does exactly that, then my favourite game element is also included: headology. Clever play, including pure bluff, from others certainly will make you reconsider your options halfway through the bid phase, complicated by the fact that you can't use all your bidding cards if you want to be active in the second turn-phase. Facing more options and problems than possibilities to deal with them in each turn is usually, like here, a sign of fun and attractive game play.

That it stays a tight game is credit to a balanced design, and the author has made great use of a terrific erosion element, making impaired progress part and parcel of successful temple building. All good.

I do wonder if it's maybe a bit too linear for others in our group though, lacking that little something "else". You are either successful at placing your stones in profitable ways, or you are not, and ultimately only that will determine the winner. There are not many plan-b strategies available, and when the real excitement seems to be in the auctions themselves, not in what you can do as a result, maybe the income element has become a bit too detached from the fun part of the game. It is what is keeping this from becoming a classic in my opinion anyway.

I do feel that Morgenland and Ars Mysteriorum managed to make the bit after the (similar) bidding phase more dramatic, and thus rate those slightly higher.  

On the whole, it packs a lot of well-liked and clever game mechanisms in a balanced and densely layered design, yet somehow it has captured a depth that usually comes only in games that take at least twice as long to play. Not a filler in the usual fluffy sense, but should really get more play than it does.

I have wanted to get this to the table for 10 years.  Finally did.  Blind bidding and area control.  The game, once we got through some murky rules (or it was the heat) played well.  We played with the advanced rules which added an auction for some powers.  

It was an all right game.  Might make the table again.  After the second round, the three of us realized how many cards to hold back to ensure we got all the stone out of the quarry.  That number seemed to be pretty static.  I'm glad I got to play but I just don't see this going any higher than a six.  There are other games that do this better.

Area influence with (semi) blind bidding - nothing here to excite me and theme is paper thin ... and doesn't really fit (why are blocks removed?).

Game of 2 halves - first you get cubes, in the 2nd you place them, but 2nd part the decisions are rather obvious.

First part is the most interesting, if you can stand blind bidding, biggest problem with it for me is the -3 cards, they offer the most interesting mechanic, but because they are in the 6-8 range they are marked so making it rather obvious where they've been placed.

Overall, bit meh ... many other games I'd rather play.

RATING: 5
It has a lot of great mechanics that I love--  Blind bidding, double action cards, building strategy, etc.  And yet in the end it all fell flat.  I don't know what it is but the game was missing something.  Two gripes:  first off the scoring with coins is a pain.  Too many coins... they should have used a scoring track.  Plus with the Mayan symbols on the back the 1 is a dot but the 5 is a line that looks almost like a 1.  Second, I couldn't get a feel for the theme.  I could see the cards being workers and they are in the mines or transporting stones yet the whole theme still seemed tacked on.

RATING: 3
Fairly cookie cutter area influence game with a semi-blind bidding mechanic tacked on. The game essentially breaks down into two distinct halves: first you bid for the right to acquire cubes, and in the second you place them on the different areas one at a time in player order, but only on the current legal level, with higher reaches becoming accessible only when all of the present ones on all of the pyramids are full. The initial phase of the game where one acquires cubes is facilitated via a semi-blind bid, where each player has the same 8 cards, 4 of them of lower value, 3 of higher value, and one of -3 to an opponent. The backs of the lower cards are distinct from the higher + the spoiler, which keeps bidding from being completely random, but the minus card should not have had a high back IMO because it makes it much too easy to tell where it is most of the time. The second part of the game where the stones are placed has some interest, but most of the interactions have to do with timing, and depend oftentimes on the special chits that one gets in the auction along with the cubes, in general staying in late on a given turn is very good because you can force other players to do your dirty work for you by filling in rows, and then go to work by yourself on the higher levels of the pyramid. Despite all of this stuff, the overall game struck me as fairly blah. The blind bid wasn't overly chaotic because of the backs, but it wasn't exciting either. It was generally fairly easy to tell where you were, and similarly so on the cube placement phase. A series of tactical decisions, followed by a scoring, rinse, repeat. This can be ok if the tactical decisions have interest, but in Maya they all seemed fairly straight-forward to me. Not a bad game, but not compelling, and I can think of a large number of area influence games I would choose to play before this one.

I originally heard comments about this game like "nothing to see here folks move along". In my opinion I'd say thats too harsh. This game is just fine, not brilliant, but is original enough. I mean if you can critize this then you should critize San Juan. So I give the game a full 7.5 for being solid but not exceptional. If you only want a few games this isn't one to get but there are a ton of games out there with a average rating around 7.

I haven't read everyone's comments, so I don't know if this is common knowledge, but this reminds me a LOT of Aladdin's Dragons. Basically half of the game is secret bids using cards, just like AD's tokens. There is an interesting mechanic where you get to choose when to stop, and there's a reason to hold back some of your cards. After only one play, I can say I enjoyed it, and will definitely play again, but it feels like it's missing something.

Players have a hand of cards they use to bid for cubes each round (of 3). After players are done bidding, cards are revealed and resolved and players earn cubes (stones). Next, players take turns placing the cubes they just won on the temple spaces. After all players are done placing, temples are scored, and players earn VPs for majority (1st and 2nd) on each temple row. 

Decent game by the same designer who made Peloponnes. This one's a little more JASE though.

Blind bidding paired with influence in areas (or levels :-). Blind bidding doesn't grab me at the best of times and I found this game particularly uninspiring. It was still OK as a way to pass the time until we realised it was all about getting the most blocks to place in the last round. Being able to freely place blocks into the top rows will win you the game. Of course, this means you'd better not be winning before the last round so players wont focus thier bidding against you. Blech!

A very enjoyable game with some interesting limiting mechanics.

As well as the erosian mechanic to hold back the winners on each level of a pyramid, there is an nice balancing mechanism in the dual purpose of the cards in earning cubes and limiting the number you can carry.
 
It's important to time your placements to take advantage of the extra cube you can earn by finishing a level with a simple majority on a level.

Maya is a combination of very familar elements; blind bidding, special actons, placing wooden cubes, majority scoring, bunged together with a pointless theme required to explain the presence of pyramids. We forgot to apply the card limit for the quarries, which might have mattered. It works, but it wasn't as good as I'd been lead to believe. I'm happy to try it again, I could certainly have played better, but it did not seem more than the sum of its parts. Heyho.

Played 1 time. I really liked the pyramid building mechanic, but I have to agree with Andrew Nick&#039;s &quot;been there done that&quot; synopsis. In fact, my friend Sean summed it up this way: &quot;It&#039;s like someone took mechanics from a whole bunch of games and programmed them into a computer, and had it randomly spit out a game witha c ombi of mechanics. The pyramids are cool but feels very disjointed from the budding. The game just doesn&#039;t have a lot of sould for me. It really does feel like parts form other games. Influence scoring from El Grande, blind bidding for actions/cubes like Aladdin&#039;s Dragons, cards have two optioms like Capitol -- but it just isn&#039;t too engaging. I just missed winning my first game of this by 6 points, but didn&#039;t care too much, nor can I tell you how to keep other players in check, since the blind nidding determines so much of what you&#039;ll be able to do with the rest of your turn. Too bad. I was looking forward to this one.

RATING: 6.8
An area control game with blind bidding.

The game lasts for 3 rounds, and about 45 mins.

A player quarries blocks (blind bidding), then builds pyramids with the blocks.  This is were the first mechanic I enjoyed comes in.  Each player has an identical set of 8 cards which depict both workers for carrying stones to the pyramids and numbers for bidding.  It becomes a balancing act--which cards to bid and which cards to save for transport.  Then comes scoring a clever erosion mechanic.

It mechanics fit together well, but the theme is not particularly strong since I can think of several substitutes.

Components are nothing outstanding, but the easy rules are well written and illustrated.  I printed out some player screens from a file here on BGG in case players want to keep cubes & money secret.  I thought the game was adapted well to different numbers of players.  An advanced version suggests a variation on the bidding but I don't like it as well.

I don't see this game getting pulled off the shelf often but looking forward to when it does.

Plays a little slow the first time, so I am looking forward to giving it another go.  I do like that this has a little more weight to it than to some other blind bidders out there.  Getting blocked out will kill ya.  The jury is out for me on the advanced version with the extra tokens you bid on.  The tokens didn't seem to really add much, other than just extending the play time of the game.  Definitely a solid game though.

All in All, I thought this was an average game and gave it a score of exactly average (5.5).  Unlike others here, I like blind bidding.  However, if you want to play a blind bidding game, I would suggest Aladdin's Dragons which in my opinion does it better than this game.    This game is broken into three rounds each with two parts: blind bidding for building cubes and then a placement phase where those cubes are placed to build Mayan pyramids for scoring purposes using an area majorities mechanic for each level of each pyramid.  

The blind bidding portion was the highlight for me but was less fun/interesting than Aladdin's Dragons because there are fewer spaces to bid and too many rewards on each space.  This seemed to limit both the amount of risk and amount of bluff.  Think of playing Aladdin's dragons with ONLY the 5 dragon mine locations to bid on but with each location giving a number of gems to the 1st and 2nd place bidders and a couple giving to ALL three bidders in a three player game.

The placement portion was where I felt the game really fell short in my opinion.  There are only five choices (in a three player game) for where you may place your stones through the first round because you must place on the 1st floor of one of the temples until they are ALL filled.  However, the choices you make this first round are the most interesting/important because they set the foundation for where you can realistically play stones in the following placement rounds.  The latter two placement rounds are lacking in important choices as the choice of where you should play your next stone is restrained by the rule that you must fill in the lower levels first and realistically constrained by which pyramids you concentrated on in the first placement round.  These restraints make 80% of you placement decisions in the last two rounds either an easy choice or a situation where you have no choice.  EXCEPT for the harder choices in the first placement round, the rest of the placement portion of the game just felt like a simple min-max operation to me.

RATING: 5
A good little AC game that does enough to keep you interested and engaged but does lack in the strategy department particularly in long term.  A round consists of some blind auctions done with card placement however these are not simultaneous but rather cumulative, players are vying in different spots to win cubes for later placement and special powers to help along the way.

These auctions will end when everyone passes, the other thing to know is that each spot being bid on does have a maximum number of cards that can be played so once triggered it stops the bidding for that item. The next phase is just simple placements into the different pyramids, these are somewhat restricted but there are some options to help capitolize on timing aspects or to trigger a level filling up ensuring you have the majority which will net you a bonus.  

The game did play a little better than I thought after reading the rules however it is on the lighter side of a middle weight so I hoped it would play in an hour and our game ran longer than this not sure why, I think the next game should hit the hour mark.  This game should scale well 3 to 5 and the components are setup to accommodate each number separately.

石材でピラミッドの段ごとのエリアマジョリティーを取る。石材は投入人員のマジョリティーが必要だけど石材を運ぶ人員の残す必要あり。得点すると石材が崩れる手抜き工事ピラミッド。高得点人員カードと相手を-3するカードの裏面が通常人員と異なるのがキモ。他にありそうで無いちょっと変わったテイスト。

I dislike blind bidding, so that's the half the game I don't enjoy. The other half is interesting, I like the fact that you can cut off other people access to the higher levels, and you have to make sure you have a solid "foundation" to combat erosion.

But the two phases seem really disconnected, I never felt the need to significantly adjust my strategy from round to round in the bidding phase based on what I have in the pyramids. My goal was always to maximize the number of cubes I have.

Surprisingly a fun a game.  Mechanically sound.  It's a quick euro with secret bidding, player interaction, and majority control.  It's good, try it out.

Trade value = pretty good condition; missing 2 greens ovals (finding real replacements/ I made some replacements, but I'm no artist -- the ovals are open info).  Yellow set of bidding cards have been stained on one corner (relatively consistent with each other so it's playable without giving out information)

It's a bad game, a very bad game. 

Maya is a game where players try to build pyramids that are never going to get built because they erode themselves so much that the game will end before that happens.

Come on! If the objective of the game is to build something that will never be built, then let's play another game please.

The card placement/bidding mechanic is OK, it's not bad or good, I can live with it. But the special powers given by those bidding are extremely weak and half of them are useless. So stronger powers would have been necessary. But at least, that can be easily patched up.

Keeping 1 or 2 cards to be able to move cubes is a good idea, it's just you have no idea of how much you need since you don't know how much you will get. So a suggestion would be that cubes could be carried over so that if a player has a lot of cubes in reserve, he will keep more cards. Leaving more space for players to compete on the bidding.

It's actually impossible to build any of the pyramids, first because you need to build all level 1 floors of all pyramids before building the second floor. And second because the pyramid erode itself every turn. So you must almost start over again on the next turn.

My suggestion, no pyramid erosion and score the floor once completed. This way the pyramids are going to get built and a player not in a pyramid will try to build somewhere else. If you want more points, each cube give the first value as points. So more cubes = more points.

Another weird things is that there are rules that are either useless or that rarely to occur. For example, there is little advantage to pass in cube placement except in a very rare situation. So why would I take the special power that allows me to pass for free.

Second, there is this situation where if you have a single majority on a floor just completed and that all the floor of the same level are completed, you get an extra cube. In our game it happened once. So why bother with a rule that almost never happens. If it would have occurred each time you completed a floor, then now there would have been a good reason to have that rules since it could happen multiple times per turn.

There is a variant for special powers that can be auctions. I don't really like auctions, especially blind ones, because a player could kill himself by over bidding. The special powers are more useful than the other powers, but still, I would use something else than auctions, like first to pass in card placement or cube placement get first pick on a power for next turn or next phase.

Finally, the box is so huge. There is so much wasted space. It could probably have fit in a box 1/4 of the original size.

So horrible game that could probably be easily fixed, but why would you want to spend time fixing this game?

Played it with six and thought it was too long for what it is.  It's an okay game but I strongly suspect that the advantage tips to the player in the 1st round who gets the most building blocks (b/c they start with a bigger foundation).  Probably handles better with 3 or 4 players.

The sequential rounds of blind bidding without knowing the results of any of the bids is miserable for me.  I feel like I'm just making random guesses as I bid into the chaos of bids.

I also don't enjoy the force move feeling of the stone placement.

Based on 2 plays with 5 players, once with the advanced actions.

After two games played I think it feels to be the most underrated game on the geek I played. It takes many elements from great games and pack them in an hour of tense gameplay.
Some say it's not as meaty as other games, but considering it's short playing time, how tense it is and no down time it's really a winner.
It really feels like a game that you would find in the top 500.

Only played with 3 players and it was great.
Because of the blind bidding aspect of the game I expect it to be more chaotic with more players.

I'm not particularly fond of most area majority games, anyway, but some (El Grande, Belfort) have enough other things going on that I enjoy them. Maya, however, seems like an exercise in pure area majority, and comes off quite dry. It was also very tactical: the path to win seemed like getting the most cubes (the special powers seemed to have only a minor influence) and placing each cube in the best possible spot. Often a player's fate in scoring was due more to whether it was in other players' interest on any given cube placement to compete with them than based on any decision that particular player made.

This game could go either way based on more plays. My initial impression is that while it reminds me of other games, the way the mechanics interact gives this enough freshness to interest me. I look forward to some more plays, which is a good early sign. *** UPDATE *** I still can't figure out if I really like this game. I should - it has all the things that I normally find interesting in games; but I find myself not enjoying it as much as I thought I would when I started playing. The jury is still out...

It's a fine take on blind bidding, with the card play almost identical to Aladdin's Dragon. Once the cubes are won, then there's the cube laying section to gain majorities in a bunch of areas. The problem is there's not much tension of excitement. You either win the cubes or not once the played cards are revealed, and then the choices when playing for majorities tend to be pretty obvious. Hence, not a lot to draw one back.

A lot of fun in a 3 or 4-player game. The bidding is fast and easy and everyone gets a lot of material to work with on the pyramids. The bonus second build and the free extra build tiles may be the most important ones for gaining a narrow victory.

RATING: 7.5
Very clever & enjoyable game of getting gold (victory points) for helping build the Mayan temples.
Use your workers (cards) to start bidding for stones at the quarry, plus additional benefits.
Save enough workers to be able to transport them to the buildings or lose out on what you're unable to carry.
Build the temples from the bottom up, grabbing additional stone benefits for the next level when you are the majority colour on the just completed one.
Get rewarded with gold for the highest two contributions on each level.
Then watch out for the erosion of time as gaps start to appear. Any unsupported pieces of your colour could all be removed.
A really enjoyable game. 
Seems to scale well through all number of players.

It has been theorized that the Mayan civilization was destroyed by severe drought.  As a simulation of that event, this game fully succeeds as the game play is as dry as bone.  It takes all the majesty and artistry out of the process of building temples to the gods and turns it into a number crunching exercise.  Considering that the name of the publisher is Abacus this should hardly be surprising.  I think learning to actually use an abacus would be more fun than playing Maya.

Not a bad little game. Easy to understand and follows a logical process in a way. Quarry, build, score... or Semi-blind bid for cubes, leave enough points on cards to transport cubes, place cubes, score. There's enough in here to recommend as a light thinking game, but it does run a little long for what it is. Reminds me of Chang Cheng, but I prefer this because the blind bidding is not quite as blind.

Very simple abstraction of Ye Old Grande area control.  It is hard not to say, this is how you get your cubes from the provinces to your court.  Still, while perhaps not being overwhelmingly exiting, it works well, and there are fun results to how things flush out.  There is blind bidding in the game, but you bid with renewable cards, and you have a keen sense of what kind of values that people are playing.  There is some fun drama as the bidding cards are flipped.  Certainly, this part of the game is much more entertaining than the droll and entirely similar system of Anthony and Cleopatra as it is only a cog in the wheel rather than the whole game. 

The erosion management is engaging, and there are a number of real decisions to make because of it.  I fear that there is a high likelihood of kingmaking, that would irritate people, but as long as you understand that folks are playing for their own position, then it is fine.

Nothing stellar, but a solid game.  I'm not sure I believe the 60 minutes written on the side of the box though.  If it actually played in 60 minutes it may get more play.

Reminds me of Goa in the sense that the game is purely mechanical and might as well not even have a theme, but there is one pasted on there somewhere.  Maya has many mechanics I enjoy, such as bidding, as does Goa as well (although I like Goa better), but it feels uninspiring, even to someone like me where theme isn't all that important.  Still, it's not bad, just a little on the long side for what it is.

Blind bidding for groups of cubes, then taking turns to place those cubes to score VP for area influence. A couple of nifty ideas (limits on how many cubes you can use, erosion of temples) but not enough here to stand out in a crowd. I'd happily play again, since I'm particularly partial to area influence games, but I'm not sure about the other players.

RATING: 6
Very good with 3 and scales well up to 5 because of the changing number of quarries and pyramids.  Reminds me a lot of Mykerinos (in a good way) because you place to gain cubes which are then placed for scoring.  Also shares the small footprint of Mykerinos.  Great artwork and theme (even if it is just pasted on, it still serves to explain the game well).  A five-player game with mostly new players took almost 2 hours but hopefully this would play in an hour with experienced players, which would improve the experience somewhat.  Still a very good game with a nice blend of bidding, special powers, and cube placement.

Very good, very challenging game made up of a variety of mechanics.  It's not quite up there with some of the other publishers' "big box" games, since there is only one way to accumulate VPs, but it's a little-known competitor.  It seems to play better with fewer players, since the blind bidding creates a bit of chaos.

Stone-by-stone, players build Mayan pyramids.  Players obtain the stones in a blind-bidding auction round, and build the stones onto the pyramids level by level, trying to score points by having the majority of stones at each level.

Played once. I love how all the elements of the game work together - you have to keep workers to be able to transport any blocks you win. You have to make sure you have enough blocks to counter erosion.. and you have to try to avoid setting your opponents up for bonus blocks early in the round. Luckily, I caught onto this early and won. :)

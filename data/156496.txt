1 play / 4 players.

LIKE: Exploring mechanism, unique theme.
DISLIKE: Heavy text on cards. Lots of "take that" and attacking, but well balanced.

OVERALL: Not a terrible game but not really for me, as the conflict is very high. The cards add too much unneeded complexity.

March of the Ants welds together light resource engineering with area control.  Ants peacefully colonise an area until they exceed its capacity.  What follows is a simple and costly combat.  Reminiscent of Evo, players can upgrade body parts to give special abilities.  And that's about it really. It all works, but there is nothing very compelling going on.  

The artwork is distinctly old school.  For some reason, the worm holes had me thinking of Yellow Submarine.  Production quality is decent.

The game mechanics remind me "Donminant Species" and "Polis: fight for the hegemony". The battle does not have game-changing effect but generates appropriate tension. Card play generates significant and interesting interactions between players. The concept of ant evolution is not only thematically awesome but very successfully implemented. I only played 2 player game with wife. want to play it with more people. Highly recommended, must-have game!!

I'm still getting a feel for this one, and I've only played it solo. My initial impressions are that it is pretty good, but it feels a little claustrophobic at time since they tried to fit a 4x type game into 45 minutes. The theme is pretty interesting, and the core mechanisms are fun. There is definitely some strategy, and you have to make challenging choices. However, I think your options are probably a little more open in a multiplayer game. This isn't my favorite solo game, but definitely is a keeper and gives me a different style game than I typically play solo.

Based on one game, score may change.

There seemed to be a bit of a run-away-leader problem, and for a game that invites battling for area control, fighting is too costly.

I fought an opponent for a tile fairly early, and even had a good evolution to support me, but got totally destroyed and never managed to come back in the game for real.

Still, beautiful components, some interesting mechanics and a cool theme.

I hate rating a game when I haven't made up my mind on it yet on just a couple of quick plays, but... 

March of the Ants has a lot of good things going for it. It is a mid-weight Euro like game with some "take that" elements. There's a lot to like here; great theme, beautiful art, plenty of player interaction, tight resource management, area control mechanics, various ways of victory conditions and interesting, engaging gameplay with the cards all in about an hour. Did I say that the art and theme are gorgeous???

 That is why I felt a bit disappointed with a couple of issues that I thought the game had. They are the round end condition, the swinginess of some of the cards, the frustration of right when your engine is going the game ends and the harshness of the consequences of going into battle. 

First, the condition set for the round to end seemed a little odd. When two players pass, the round immediately ends. That seemed a bit harsh for players that were doing good with their engines.

Some of the cards seemed a bit powerful compared to others and the luck of the draw sometimes played a role.

It might seem that I'm being overly harsh on the game, but only for liking what it does very much. It reminded me of 4X games and Dominant Species in a way while maintaining the Euro feel. I like what the game does and the time it does it in, but it seemed a little underdeveloped.

Take these comments with a grain of salt since I've only played it twice and hopefully, March of the Ants will shine more for me with subsequent plays. If anything could be said is that the game has a certain charm to it and I'm looking forward to getting it on the table again.

This is a very clever game that oozes theme and really makes you feel like you are building up your colony of ants to vie for meadow domination. You have a bit of resource management, opportunity for conflict and destroying your opponents' forces, and cards that make you choose between playing them either for special powers / events / longterm goals, or playing them for bonuses in battle. Lots of interesting decisions all around. And a brilliant system of players taking re-actions to the current player's action, so there is almost zero downtime even when it's not your turn.

Everyone explored & took a new tile. My neighbor also attacked me, and won by 1. Wiped me out completely. On the start of the 2nd turn, I had less than when I began the game, and everyone else was a turn ahead. If that can happen in a game, where one person is completely after the first turn, totally screwed, with no way to win, it's better as kindling than a game. Worthless.

2015, Kickstarter.  Light resource mgt plus area ctrl.

Others say:  Simple and costly combat like in Evo.  Supposedly a 4X type of game (explore, expand, exploit, whatever).  The exploring is decent.  Lots of "take that" and lots of conflict/attacking.  The game works but isn't very exciting or compelling.  Just another Euro game of using actions to collect cubes and translating them into VPs.  Dull, uninspiring, slow and plodding.  It comes with tons of map tiles, but you don't use very many of them in a given game.  Would rather play Nexus Ops.

Tom Vasel says: The round ending trigger of 2 players passing is bad... with 3p, it's fine... but with 4-5p it's pretty crappy.  Battles are brutal (costly for both winner and loser) but unavoidable because cards tend to be imbalanced and eventually someone will become powerful enough to wipe out other players since there tends to be a rich-get-richer problem.

ES un 4X del estilo del eclipse, pero simplificado para que tenga una duración más corta. El juego es bastante temático. Cada jugador gestiona una colonia de hormigas.. y con ellas puede explorar, jugar cartas, mover y robar cartas. 
Las cartas las hay de tres tipos: eventos, mejoras y puntos de colonia (que darán puntos al final de la partida). Las mejoras se aplican al cuerpo de una hormiga (cabeza, torax y abdomen) y otorgan una cualidad única a tu raza de hormigas.

Las batallas son sencillas, aunque pueden resultar algo confusas cuando participan varios jugadores. 
 
Es sencillo de jugar, y bastante entretenido. Tiene una variante en el que las razas de hormigas son diferentes de base.

Recomendable.

I typically don't like games with so many worker/resource elements, but because of the game mechanics and player interactions, this game really captivated--and still captivates--my attention.  I was able to play a few prototype games at a game store and I have yet to find an issue with this game.  Once you figure out how the game functions, you are rewarded with a ton of gameplay in which to figure out the strategy.

There are a lot of things here I really liked: Building an ant species with various special powers, the secondary actions that all other players get to take when another pklayer takes an action, the harvesting of resources from the board... these are all cool things.

However, I felt like those parts just didn't come together well, and the game still required a fair amount more development. The game seemed like it was over just when things started to get more interesting, there is a pretty large luck of the draw issue, combat was pretty wonky and unwieldy in some situations, and the mechanism for ending a round could often end up in very short rounds where it didn't feel like much of anything happened.

It also felt like maybe the game was intended to be played a certain way... there's a giant stack of tiles to potentially explore, and in a full 4-player game, we only explored the designated 8 starting tiles, and never made it into the rest of the stack. Maybe it was just due to the special abilities we got where we focused on things other than exploring, but it felt odd.

Overall, it just felt like the whole came up as less than the sum of its parts. I 'd love to see this game receive more development and polish, because there's something cool here.

I really enjoyed this game, even though it has that element of not being able to control your own destiny sometimes. That is usually an element of a game that immediately turns me off from wanting another play. Like Colin said though, there is more depth in there, and multiple ways for you to play the game, that I am intrigued to come back for more. I think players calling out the powers on the cards that they lay on their ant would be a way to get everyone more comfortable, and perhaps help you make decisions for how others might play their end game. I made a silly mistake that may not have clinched me the win, but would have made me at least happier that I had done all I could!

I think one more round and another 20 minutes of gameplay would be ideal spot for this game too, something that is impossible with the constraints of the lunch hour group.

This is a lot of fun so far. Right now I think it's really high on my list of favorites. It's got some depth and looks like it will have a ton of replay ability. 

I played it with my 12 and 7 year olds and McKenna seemed to understand the concepts pretty well, we just had to help with card text and understanding how those things work. I think she'll get the hang of it pretty quickly.

2017-08-03 : First play of this area control / engine builder which has a real The Good, The Bad and the Ugly problem. The good is that the mechanics keep everyone involved all the time, the Bad is hat neither of those mechanics is particularly strongly developed.and the really Ugly is that if you draw good colony goals early on, you win, draw them late or not at all and you'll come in last. It's the kind of game where you can come come in last, where in hindsight you did nothing wrong, but the luck of the draw simply did not go your way.

Fantastic game with beautiful art and a very tightly integrated theme.

An okay 4x-lite game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  Can be a bit short (maybe 3 actions total every round), but you could always play an extra round.

Always play with the extra tiles that have special rules, otherwise there isn't enough variety in the locations to make this as interesting.

Could use better art, especially on the board.

I hate ants in my house but man ants in general are fascinating. I love biology themes so this is definitely a hit, thematically. I would say this game, like Dead of Winter, is just a *little* bit too fiddly. The way battles work in general is so important to the game and so hard to teach. However, it's still a really good game and I think it would be even better if I played it with the same group a few times.

RATING: 9
Played it at Hilton Gamestorm in 2014, then backed it on Kickstart knowing it would have cooperative and solo variants. It is more of a battle game with direct attacking which I don't care for much, but I love the theme. Once I get around to playing it cooperative or solo I can pop a little more information in here. 

Edit: After having played several solo games I have found I really enjoy it. It gets easier to figure out what you can do after a few games. With a few more games I may learn more, but it seemed keeping an army built up in the highest numbered hex, and getting evolved ant bodies gave me an edge to win at solo. I will be laminating the thin cardboard mats, and already sleeved the cards for protection. Cards and mats are pretty thin (at least in the 1st version).

Edit: Cooperative seems pretty hard to beat, but I've only played a couple games of that. We got spanked hard!

The most surprising thing about this game is that it's actually a 4X game like Eclipse, but with the setting changed to a meadow with competing colonies of ants.

The interactions work really well together, and the game ends just when it starts to bog down with too many options (which is a great thing).

I look forward to more plays to get a better feel for how everything works together.

I enjoyed my first play. It was a two player game that ran a bit over an hour with explanation.  The game was fairly intuitive yet I found myself agonizing over many of the decisions I was presented.  

Pros:  
-  4x game with a decent playing time
-  Simple rules with intuitive gameplay
-  Artwork was appeasing...Kickstarter components were nice
-  The theme may be pasted on but at least it's different.  I don't consider myself a   good barometer on this point but for what its worth it worked for me.
-  Appears to support multiple paths to victory
-  Can be played solo

Cons:
 - Certainly a luck factor with the card pulls.  Not sure how well the cards are balanced.
-  I see some potential for king making...particularly in a three or five player game.
-  Not sure how forgiving the game is.  VPs are tight and if you fall behind early I suspect it's difficult to catch back up.
-  The text on the cards is tiny.  It was impossible for me to read my opponents cards from across the table.

During the rules explanation there was a number of comparisons made to Eclipse.  Could probably make some weak comparisons to Dominant Speices as well.  That said, this plays a lot quicker than both those titles and because of that the chaos and randomness from the cards is more palatable.  Overall I look forward to future plays of this.

A failure for me.  Game benefits players for not interacting and competing for space early.  Encourages everyone to go their own way.  Standard game (4 turns) is over too quickly to develop any late game strategies; recomend extended game (5 turns).  Ant mutations seemed cool but early on were hard to develop because of paucity of resources and late in the game turn over repeatedly as players buy card after card.

This is really a fantastic game. Played our second 4 player game last night and it was quite close. It was clear there were many ways to win. We all want more. Eclipse meets Dominant Species but all so much easier to play and track with a constant tension throughout. A lot of ant species system focus and a good amount of interaction. And the art and board and ant upgrades are all so great. It makes me feel like I'm an ant fanatic.

And it has wormholes that allow you to move between far away spaces. Win.

A short 4X game that holds it's own despite some flaws. A few of the cards are a bit too powerful, and with few exceptions, battle is a bit too costly to consider, but for a play time of about an hour, it shines fairly brightly. Your card draws tend to significantly influence your strategy, and keep things fresh and interesting, and the optional solo-play and co-op variants make for a interesting and enjoyable bonus.

I was lucky enough to play this game at Gamestorm this year in Vancouver, WA.  While March of the Ants is still in its final developmental stage, it already offers unusually tight gameplay and dynamic variability in the choices available to the players.  Interesting tile placement exploration blends well with a multi-use card system that allows you to evolve, trigger events or receive battle bonuses.  It is all enhanced by great art throughout.  This is the increasingly rare game that's actually worthy of your Kickstarter dollars, and then some!

I really like this game a lot. I heard it described as a shorter, streamlined version of Eclipse, which I think is a fair comparison. 

I wonder how many distinct paths to victory it offers. Focusing on battling ants and centipedes seems viable. Exploration for tile control seems viable. I would love to see if focusing on ant evolution alone would be viable. I don't think focusing on Colony Goals would be viable since you are limited to two, but they can certainly help to determine which strategy you pursue. 

I love the versatility in the official rules -- competitive, cooperative, and solo. Cooperative has been totally brutal. Solo has been fun and challenging. Competitive is a blast.

(10/17) 7. Great, brutal area control game.  I love the head/thorax/abdomen upgrade system that you can use to increase your ants powers.  Also, fantastic theme obviously.

RATING: 7.5
Great little game.  Surprising how little cubes can still end up being themeatic with the ants cards.

Its an alternative and refreshing take on a 4x.

The alternative sides to the ants give something different, only tried a couple of times. Not sure how evenly balanced they are and would need to play more to test.

Having the centipede deck is a 3rd way to play. Only tried that once as 3 player and we got trounced... Its a refreshing alternative and having a coop mode gives yet another option in a small box.

Might increase my rating if play the other modes more and aleviate my concerns with them, however theres an expansion now and not getting to play as often as I like so likely to try that so it will be a while.

You control a colony of ants competing for resources in a shared meadow, engaging in battle to claim land for yourself or establishing peaceful, symbiotic relationships and sharing the spoils, while carefully managing the resources in your underground nest and mutating unique evolutions.

A 4X strategy game of area control a modular board, with hand management, and variable player powers.

First play was successful.  There is a lot to like about the game.  Took a bit to explain up front, but once the game gets going, it makes sense and flows smoothly.  Early battle losses can really set a player back.  Biggest concern was that the game can drag on if no two players want to end it.

Probably my #3 or #4 game.  I know that the whole bug theme probably turns people off, but this game is a true gem among 4X games.

In Civilization (PC) terms:
- You can play for Military, Research, Culture, and Economic victories
- You can play Isolationist, Expansionist, and join in alliances and coexist with other players
- You can play Wide or Tall

Your resources are all used for multiple purposes, combat is quick and deadly, and I've seen players perform well doing all sorts of strategies.

If bugs still bother you, I dunno what to tell you.  Ants are fascinating insects, and they're made even more fascinating by this game.

Did I mention that the co-op is fantastic?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I only got in a two-player learning game, so I’m witholding any real judgement. March of the Ants is a game wherein players control different groups of ants. In order to succeed, players must collect resources, explore and settle new territories, and engage in combat with other players and NPCs (non-player centipedes). When a player takes an action on his turn, the other players get a chance to use a response (think Puerto Rico, Glory to Rome, etc). This aspect is definitely more suited for a multi-player setting and I think the game will be much better with more than two. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the play and look forward to seeing how things work with more players.

Edit. Is a great great game! It is refreshing and exciting and utterly unique seeming! I love it, the theme and the mechanics and the quality are lovingly crafted.
Solo / co-op mode is impossssssible! Either I am missing something or that scenario is mad broken. Is minor, but my only complaint of a fantastic game.

RATING: 9
Great game with a lot of different game modes. I enjoy the competitive mode and I love the coop/solo game. Every play is diferent and the mechanics work nicely. Sometimes I got the feeling that the luck is a bit to important.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update: Overall, too combative a vibe (unless playing co-op), too much clunky upkeep and too much fantasy (ant sections) for my taste; there doesn't seem to be much educational gain for the time spent.

Purchased mainly for the solo game but the different theming was also a hook. Really enjoying the solo games, really impressed by the design especially from first time designers and first time publisher. However, looking into the standard playing I feel it is too combative with the cards to be palatable in my groups and also concerns about a deceleration to finish.

Yeah, there are concerns after playing a dummy 2 hander (competitive mode): the colony goals (contract kicker) if you get them seem to be best played when other players rest otherwise it is a wasted play; and this issue of thoughtful card play/decisions being undermined by the combative nature and cards enhancements (from a deck difficult to commit to memory and track) means possibly too much chaos for so little gain.

So the game may well shine in the solo/co-op mode as you can at least apply some assessment skill as to how the centipedes will behave, and the theme seems to come through more in this mode. 

Myrmes seems to be appealing to me more, less text clutter, a little more look ahead (maybe too much) and more immersive art.

MotA has an immersive theme that is really brought to life through amazing artwork. The mechanics foster a lot of player interaction; the game feels highly strategic without ever feeling overly complex, fiddly, or dragging. My favorite part of the game has to be the Evolutions; I love choosing how my colony will change and grow as I plan for meadow dominance!

Really enjoyed the theme, but gameplay wasn't that compelling.

* Although it was interesting to decide what action to do on your turn, doing the action itself didn't offer any interesting decisions.

* The Puerto-Rico-like action selection mechanism seemed interesting at first glance, but the action/benefit that all players get when you select an action is a no-brainer or barely significant

* Not enough incentive to attack opponents. Cubes could be used for many different things in the game; attacking seemed just a bit too risky compared to buying cards or simply staying put on a resource-collecting square.

* Because of this lack of incentive to attack opponents, there's also less incentive to move your ants around on the board. So even map building is not that compelling.

* The build-an-ant tech upgrade mechanic looked cool. However, actually acquiring cards to build your ant is all from drawing blindly from a deck, and costs additional resources to do so. So there's limited opportunities for creating cool combos from your techs/ant upgrades

To me, it seems this game is an attempt to create a 4X game that plays in a reasonable time duration, which it does. But perhaps this game is too streamlined for my tastes.

I might play again as it's not a strenuous game to play, but I see no reason to acquire or even request playing again.

Right now this game is at a 10, because it is right there in the front of my mind.  I will reevaluate after playing it some more.  My history with this game goes back almost two years.  I played an early draft at a con (my favorite game of the weekend), then joined the kickstarter about 11 months later, played a finished draft at the same con (still my favorite game of the weekend), and finally have my own copy.

If you are reading this you are looking for insight, and not some crazy fan voting it a 10.  Right now I'm probably that crazy fan, but I don't go crazy for every kickstarter or any other kickstarter I back.

So far every game has played differently, players can push for high conflict, or follow their own plans for low conflict.  There are several paths to victory, the deck and tiles opens up different options each game (so far). Every game has kept me wanting to play more.

I really want to like this game a lot because of the customized ant species creation, and it does seem reasonably good, but not what I'd hoped.  It's solid, but it seems to suffer from multi-player aggression stalemate/politics/kingmaking.  Balance of cards remains to be seen, as does the level of luck in PvP combat.

I found the solo game disappointing.  There is a lot of luck in combat and not a lot of interesting maneuvering since there is no competition for resources.  A neutral ant force might have been more interesting than the mindless horde of centipedes.

 Solo game is pretty cool but it eliminates one of the best aspects of the thing, which is reacting to opponent's actions. The evolution cards are really cool, the battles are brutal (don't know if that appeals to my inner savagery or if it makes me feel like battles are too tough to be a part of.. and sort of make the already tight resource management seem pointless). Anyways.. I'll keep at it because I love the Theme and presentation.

Update: Played another two player game and it still doesn't blow me away. Just ok.

Finally decided that I dom't like the game at all, not for me.

A lighter, slightly quicker (but still not super short) 4x.  I had an alright time playing it but it still felt a bit dry and the theme/artwork just wasn't doing that for me (I want both great gameplay and fun themes...what can I say).  

At 3 players, we suffered from the classic "you didn't do enough to stop them" syndrome, but honestly the board expanded enough where I felt like it would have cost WAY too much to move across the map and attack.  I felt very limited in that way, without a good way to adjust play once we realized what was going on.

Game has a lot of interesting decisions but I feel like it's weakest point is in the cards, of which they're all one-ofs, making it pretty swingy.

There are some things that I like about this game.  I really like the unique theme - it's what sucked me in to begin with.  I like that all off-turn players have an opportunity to take minor actions related to the action chosen by the current player; it keeps everyone engaged at all times.  I like the body-building (no, not the Ah-nold kind; the creation of uniquely-abilitied ants with the 3 body parts).  And I like the centipeeples.  But sadly, I found the most important part - the game play - to be mostly dull and uninspiring.  The last turn of our 3-player game was sort of exciting, but everything leading up to that felt like it plodded along fairly slowly, and there wasn't even much of a map by the end of it (despite the promisingly large pile of map tiles).  For this 4X-lite style of game, I'd much rather play Nexus Ops.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 4.5/10

Most amazing solo play-through at https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/208306/item/4624995#item4624995

My rating and comments are for the solo game. 

The good: 
* Great artwork and components
* Educational flavor text on the cards
* Plays quickly. 30 minutes once you know the game, and resetting the game is a cinch.
* Variable setup
* Custom solo card deck
* You can beat the game, and try for your best score

The not so good: 
* The rules are poorly presented. The rules are simple but the organization and clarity of the rules book are lacking.
* Takes several games to figure out the mechanics, due to the disorganized rules book.
* The AI bot opponent is OK. It gives you some things to think about (it I take an extra action it might move again) and the battles can be managed but overall it felt unsatisfying as the opponent in a solo game.

The bad:
* The luck of the draw is simply too important. There are only four rounds, so if you draw lucky (lots of Head Evolution and / or Centipedes draw Colony Goal when they have no units to battle) then you will do well. If you draw poorly (low numbers for discarding during battle, no Colony Goals you can achieve) then you will do poorly. And you need some cards; you can't win without drawing some cards. 

When I want a challenging mid-weight solo game that can be played in the same amount of time, and also with a lot of replayabiity, I would much rather pick up Viticulture or Freedom.

This has all the ingredients to be a pretty decent game. But it's hugely unbalanced. There's little point in resource management, because the fighting is going to destroy all that you have anyway. The evolution powerups are sometimes massively overpowered. It's hard to plan ahead, because in all likelihood, a player in a weaker position is going to end the round before you get a chance to do what you wanted. It's a shame, because I think this could have been good. But it isn't.

If the goal was to make a very streamlined version of Eclipse (using ant colonies instead of alien races), then mission accomplished.  The designers did a very good job at making a 4X that is easy to learn and quick to play.

Not a lot of drama or ebb and flow, though, perhaps because of how limited the number of actions each player takes in a game is.

There's a lot to like here. Evolving your own species of ants, managing an interesting card pool, the reactions that keep everyone engaged even when it isn't their turn... but still, this game fails to combine those elements as elegantly as it deserves. The result is a flawed gem.

Play as an ant hive competing against other players or as a group of ants fighting encroaching centipedes.

If a game is perfect because it accomplishes the goals it sets for itself, then this game is perfect.

A bit over-long if you start play from the snow melt round.

Just played the game for the very first time (I'm first time March of the ants backer), and loved it. I was so excited by the expansion I was dying to put the predator and parasite modules in. But we had a mixed group (me quite a heavy gamer, my gf who likes lighter games, a friend who likes heavy strategy and his who rarely ever plays).
They all loved it, it started off with a lot of exploring, and resource grabbing. Things got real after the starting hexes were all used up (a stroke of genius, by the way, some of the hexes can really sway your luck). Fights started happening towards the end. I played some centipedes on two other players, which I played Too soon and one of the players managed to mount enough of a defence and get enough points from it (beating them) and win by a few points.
I was initially concerned by the Dice Tower review when he spoke about the sleep issues. I didn't realise till the end of the game that actually effects first player in the next round. I can totally see how it could actually help stop players from totally falling behind and adds strategy to it. So I think Dice tower missed that in their review.
Really looking forward to adding in expansion next time and giving the Empress variant ago, as I just bought Twilight Imperium and might be a nice way to lead into it lol
Thanks for a great game, with so many play options. Which Im sure will be played for years to come :)

After playing several promising ant games including Myrmes,  I have found my ant game.  Not overly wrought Euro.  A successfully true to theme design.  Elegant to the point some may overlook the fun furious nature.

I like March of the Ants a lot despite some of the imbalance in the cards.

That said, I think the cooperative variant is the best thing about the game.

It's really hard, and each player has to score more than the centipede horde. There's so much for each player to do that it helps with the leader problem in lots of coops.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy from the company.

REVISED THOUGHTS: Yes, I still contest in a larger game group; one player who gets too behind could spend the rest of the game wreaking havoc for everyone else.  The end product is a very beautiful presentation and playing it with two players opened the door for multiple play styles.  Definitely a keeper and I'm glad I gave it another shot.

ORIGINAL THOUGHTS: Based on what I played at Gamestorm and after playing Myrmes, I'm not sure I'd want to play this again. Great theme, weak gameplay and it felt too easy to tank the game for others should you find yourself behind.

4X game inside an anthill. Some development could probably improve the game.

This is a really nicely themed game.  The "Eclipse-Light" rules leading to a tight battle for resources and constantly trying to improve your ants more than your neighbors give it a nice struggle for survival feel.  Still, the very limited actions, heavy rules explanation and tendency for players who fall behind early to stay behind all game make this not quite right for my game night crowd and I traded my copy away.

A fun and fast puzzle game that reminds me of Tetris. No interaction amongst players.

Recommended with 1-8+ players (best 2-8+). 20 mins.

Nice light bingo type game that is easy to teach and fun to play. A great family game that also works well with kids to reinforce addition and multiplication skills.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
OK, so it's not much of a game.  More like a competitive puzzle.  Playable by HUGE groups, however, and it's relatively easy to teach.  Quite fun, too.

I can definitely see this one fitting into a sixth grade math class curriculum (which would be a great thing for the kids).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Wow.  This was a horrible experience.  No interaction, very little strategy and not fun to play.  It fell flat for the whole group and most likely will not be played again.  Usually a rating of ~6.5 here on the geek is the sign of a good game, but not in this case.  BEWARE, play before you pay on this one.

A simple version of Take it to the Limit, got in trade (with Can't Stop). Real multiplayer solitaire! Good for an occasional play for something different, or for people who want a spacial reasoning type of game: there are three variants in the English .txt rules here on the Geek that I'd like to try for a bit of variety.

Always fun - especially near the end when everyone needs a very specific tile to come up.  But I think the thing I like most about this game is it&#039;s rather silly name.  On the hand, what else would you call it?

[ESP] Un entretenido juego para toda la familia con ingredientes de puzzle, matemáticas y bingo (no se dejen espantar por la palabra bingo, no tiene nada que ver)

*Really great math/logic game! Since math is my strongest side i have absolutely nothing against this game. I like the no luck part of this game. Either you know or you don't. If just depend on your luck, you will not get high score. I even have a little paper inside the box, with the TOP 3 of high scores and dates that they are made of. My name is only 3rd:(. I guess more practicing is needed:D, but no problem, since this game is playable by yourself only, so hands on and practice! Recommend!

I liked Take it to the Limit and I really liked this one.  I hadn't played TittL with others and found I liked playing this with others.  It was relaxing in a stressful way.  I also enjoy puzzle games so this one felt good.  It's also smaller than Limit and it was a lot faster.

RATING: 8
True multi-player solitaire, similar to the also highly recommended Don Quixote. Most people groan when I describe it as a 'brainy Bingo game', but I've yet to introduce it to someone who didn't want to play again immediately once the first game was over. It's got that 'Just one more game and the high-score will be mine!' appeal.
I'd recommend this to anyone, with no reservations.

This is a true multi-player solitaire puzzle game. Yet, it's a strangely satisfying experience. The rules are very simple and intuitive, but the game is nevertheless quite thinky and involves many difficult decisions. There's definitely more than meets the eye here, as the cliché goes. I recommend this game, and so does Tom Vasel.

I have to declare an interest here. I got my copy as a gift from the designer, with whom I worked for several years. Having said that, it's a very challenging but easy to learn and great fun. Only a slightly slow scoring period at the end stops it getting a 10.

I thought this game would be rubbish. I hate Set, this seemed like another number crunching game with no soul.  It is actually a very neat little game with some fun aspects - nothing overly complex, and for my taste best played with the normal rules (no variants) - it is a straight forward and light game, with some neat decisions thrown in.  I like it!

RATING: 7
I'm not too fond of the base game, where each player draws a tile and places it with no knowledge of what's coming. The randomness of the draw, and the inability to know what lies in the stack of tiles, reduce this game largely to luck, and unlike other "simultaneous placement" tile games (like Cities), I never get the impression that the winner is the better player.

The "Puzzle" setting on the wonderful iOS app, however, is excellent, one of my favorite abstract puzzle games. It's incredibly addicting, difficult enough to be challenging, but no so impossible that it's not fun. The perfect game to play on the subway or while waiting for a movie to start.

I think playing the computer version ruined it. After alot of online games, I get around the same amount of points every time (150-170), depending on the order the tiles come out, and whether I get the one that I really want. It's like one of those magician's tricks where you pick any number, multiply it by x, add y, divide by z, and you get 7 every time! At first you go wow, but then you realize it is pointless and stupid.

What a fun little Intellectual Bingo game. I've played with a large group where there were like 30-odd participants. That was a blast. 

I'm looking forward to trying this with a smaller group and seeing if it holds up. The game plays quickly, is intuitive to understand (rules-wise), so the teaching time is almost nil. Its a good puzzle game that should appeal to a broad audience. 

I'd be willing to play any time.

Own the FX Schmid version for 8 players.

Thought about giving this a 7. I had a lot of fun playing it and would do so again. I really enjoyed playing the odds and trying to build a good position but I don't think there is a great deal of depth. It is great fun hoping the right tile comes up.

Very pleasing abstract tile game, with shades of Ingenious and Bingo, as well as Limes and Karuba in its 'one player chooses a tile, other players follow suit' mechanism.

RATING: 7
Only solo plays thus far, but this looks like it will be another fun "mathy" game for the family with some simple multiplication.  There's certainly luck involved with the tile draws, but also quite a bit of tension when having to decide which line to break in order to keep another intact.  Also has some alternative scoring rules with the moons and suns to keep things interesting.  Better than I expected!

A huge hit for the family and my non-gaming family as well.  Non-gamers will ask you where you picked up this game since they will want one themselves.

Plays well as a family game.  Each of my kids like to play the role as the caller.  Additionally, it teaches each of them some multiplication skills to figure out their optimal scoring.  I'd recommend this game to anyone wanting to learn their math facts (multiplication up to 9).

Unfortunately, couple of tiles missing from each colour set. But since only one player uses face-down tiles, giving them a complete set of original tiles (in arbitrary colours) should be fine - the others can make do with some home-made replacements. Box insert for Ravensburg edition is a bit weird - little chance of holding the tiles in place if the box is moved anything other than perfectly horizontal.

Played a couple of rounds, and thought it was fine, for when you're in the mood.

RATING: 7
Bizarrely, someone has turned Bingo into an actual game!  The board starts out blank, and you place hexagonal pieces showing colored and numbered lines as they are called out.  The idea is to end up with as many matching lines as possible (see the photos to get an idea of how it works).  Somewhat brain-burning but quick and fun.  This is great for groups of more than 6 (you can theoretically buy as many sets as you want, and play with 4 players per set), because there is literally no downtime, but it also works well as a solitaire game (simply drawing tiles and trying to end up with the highest possible score).

This is a very good family game. It will be enjoyed mostly by those that just play games occasionally. Think Bingo/pipe laying game. Every tile has three lines of various colors and point values going through it. One is turned over and everyone finds the same tile and places it on their board in any position they want. When the board is full you check each line (15 total) to see if they scored. You are trying to match colors on lines all the way across the board to score its value times its length. The length ranges from 3 to 5 hexes across. The skill (or luck) comes in the tile placements and all the games I have played have not had a single person scoring the same as anyone else.

It is fun but light. The only real negative thing that I can say about it is with my girlfriend's family it is hard to get them to play anything else once we start playing this. Make it a finisher.

Clever, addictive puzzle game where each player plays the same tiles in "Bingo" fashion to their own puzzle mat.  The idea is to link the tiles in three directions on the mat, and pure lines of the same value will score the product of the value and the length of the line.  Simple, devious little puzzle game that is just as good solo as with 4, 8 or however many sets you want to combine.  This game has a huge "one more time" factor.

This is an ideal activity/puzzle game for gamers and non-gamers. The bingo-like nature is appealing to most people, and provides that little spark of motivation needed to get people interested. The game can be explained and set up in less than five minutes. Scoring is a little painful, but that doesn't seem to matter that much. This game seems to be an ideal gateway game to me. It's familiar but different, easy to play, easy to explain, fast playing time, and rewarding. The fact this game is not constantly suggested as a gateway game is surprising to me. 

Unlike most FRED games (and most hobby games as well), I find this game's 25 dollar price point to be a great value.

Very good game, basically a solitaire path-making game. Fascinating to compare scores because you are all placing the same pieces.
The quick &amp; easy way to score this games is to write a table with a column 1 to 9 and a row of the player&#039;s names. Then ask evrybody what they scored for ones, what the scored for twos etc. Total up the columns and you have your winner.

This game is like a cross between Bingo and Tetris...in a good way. Nice because it is different from most other games; it allows as many players to play as you have boards and tile sets; and it wonderfully easy to teach and play in almost any game group or game setting. I really enjoyed this and would like to trade for or buy a copy. Quick, challenging, fun.

Played first two games of this today (3-3-2012) with Mr. Billington.  He won both times, but I did better the second time.  Game is like a mixture of Bingo and Maori.  Wish the playing board was larger and the amount of tiles was greater (and weren't color-specific; so that you could choose from any color tile, not just your own color).  Maybe the next time we could experiment with playing on the table itself (not using the color-specific boards) and each of us could choose 3 of the colors and see how many number-rows of each color we could make.  Wait and see.  Played two 3-player games of this today (3-29-2012) with Mr. Billington and Gayle, and I think I won both games.  Alot better with 3 than 2.

If the term multiplayer solitaire hadn't already been invented this game would do it. Each turn all players receive identical chits to place them on their private boards. Of course they try to do this in the best way possible, maximizing their points. When the boards are full everyone counts and announces their score.
Somewhat more of a puzzle than a game, easily explained to newbies, and some fun once in a while.

Bingo for math students! Actually a very good party game. A 7 for me is high for a party game. Yet, it comes with only 4 boards (four players) - but is much better in my opinion with multiple games being played at once. This one grows on you, but math students seem to do best.

RATING: 7
Nifty puzzle game.  Like Bingo, a tile is called that everyone has to play. But where that tile is played determines how many points you earn.  And as you play tiles for points, you shut down areas for other points. Finding a balance between going for the quick points or hoping for a big point payout is quite cerebrally satisfying.  This is a great filler and one of the few games that can be as enjoyable for a child as it is for adult, even when playing at the same time.  An absolutely classic abstract in its own right! Nothing else like it!

[Original comment] My wife enjoys this game a lot. The rest of the family will play it occasionally. I think it's okay, but don't want to play it every week.

May 2009 -- We play this game now and then, and have fun with it.

October 2011 -- My wife selects this game often for game days. It's easy to play, so it is a good game for introducing new gamers. It is much dependent upon chance (which tiles are drawn, in which order), but players have to decide where to place tiles, based on their best estimates of probabilities of the right tiles being drawn. It's a good game that we will probably enjoy for as long as we play games.

2013-November:  This is an easy game to remember the rules, and to play fairly quickly. It's fun each time.

This is a wonderful puzzley game that kept us entertained for hours as kids. I even remember spending most of a day working out what was the absolute highest possible score. After some experimentation I had an epiphany and put the [i]lowest[/i] scoring tile in the middle. I managed to get to 307 points - which, checking now on BGG, is indeed the highest possible score.

In adulthood I acquired a second hand copy of this out of nostalgia (the XL version that allows for up to 8 players), and then it turned out to be one of the most popular games at the monthly night I run - [guild=1459][/guild]. It has the right combination of easy to learn, quick to play, but tricky to play well, that makes you want to play several times in one session.

A rather tedious and boring game that feels a lot like Bingo.  There is some decision making with how you form your lines, but the random nature of the tiles makes most payoffs more luck based than anything else.

A game of patience, played with tiles instead of a deck of common cards. Cleverly sold in sets of four, so that you can waste your time in the company of a few friends. You can test whether you like the idea or not by having 4 players playing their own game of Klondike with separate decks where all the cards are presorted in the same order: who wins the game? Ho-hum...

A group solitaire style game where one player calls out the next tile and everyone places it on their own mat with the goal of connecting similar colour tubes in multiple directions to score points in each row.

Solitaire for many. Works well for 1 to 8. Which numbers will you match up to maximize scoring knowing that you will have to scrap some of the lines? Which player will be the best at doing so? Scoring is a slight challenge as it requires arithmetic.

A very light fast playing little solitaire tile-layer game that reminds me a little of metro although here when other people play they use their own board and now you have something that resembles bingo.

By looking at the components and reading the rules, it's hard to imagine how the game will play out, as it looks very boring with whimsical graphics and colored lines and numbers.  Still the game generally provokes a very positive reaction, with lots of excited outbursts or groans depending on the tiles drawn.  There are definitely some decisions to be made (I would compare it more to Schotten Totten/Battle Line sans action cards than Bingo, though it is very Bingo-ish) about placement, and one can analyze, but it still moves quickly.  Playing with a large group helps, since there is a greater reaction/social feeling to what is essentially a solitaire game, and it makes the AP-prone keep up with the rest of the crowd.

I got this game as a birthday present from my godmother back in the nineties. It is a relatively light and quick game, which is at least some fun to play. It feels like a slightly more complex "Bingo" game, where players at least has some sort of choice and can try pushing their luck, if they want to go for some big points.

Great abstract tile laying game.  It's multiplayer bingo with strategy and I absolutely love playing it. Everybody plays the exact same tiles in the exact same order, but with massively different results.  Keep your phone calculator handy for final scoring.  I know I can get a better score than I did last time!

Quick, enjoyable filler that is easy to teach and play.  Its almost spacial bingo in that you are seeking to line up a color (or associated number) to connect in a line all the way across the play board.  You score the product of the quantity of the tile and the value of the tile as long as it is connected from one side of the playing board to the other side.  

I prefer it's younger sibling - Take It to the Limit - much more.

RATING: 7
A simple tile laying game where you try to align hexagons so that the numbers create a line of 3 to 5 in length.  The lines have numbers that range in value from 1 to 9 and you multiply by the length if it is completed.  

The game is quick, less than 20 minutes.  It plays a bit like bingo in that you call out the number and place a tile.  I really like the game, it is family friendly.  It can be played solitaire as well.  

I don't have the wild card expansion for this and I wish I did as that adds a lot to the game.  But even without it, it is a solid family friendly abstract game that plays quick.

Enjoyable and light (although frustrating at times) tile placing game.  Everybody has there own board and everybody places the same piece during each turn.  Players are trying to score the most points by connecting like numbers across their hexa-grid.  Since each tile has three colors it's near impossible to be as efficient as you would like.  The decision making is often "which line do I break up to extend this other line?"

Received as a Bonus Gift in a Chain of Generosity Contest thanks to the generosity of Warren Adams.

Visual Spatial game of placing hexagonal tiles onto individual player boards. The aim is that players are trying to create lines of the one colour that run from one side of their board to the other. With differing lengths to connect and differing values of each line, the players must weigh up both the probabilities of making connections and prioritise their decisions.

What makes the game interesting too is that the players must all place the same tile on each turn, so the player boards can evolve differently with the same resources.

Fun light game where players try to maximize points horizontally, vertically and diagonally on a hexagonal board by filling in pieces. Pieces are determined randomly in a Bingo fashion, where a designated caller (also a player) randomly picks the piece. Easy to learn. Trick is that all pieces will not be called, so one has to gamble on trying for lots of points, or cutting one's losses. Not sure why the new Ravensburger edition only has pieces for only 4 players.

An engaging puzzle where everyone plays the same tiles in parallel without knowing exactly which 19 of the 27 possible tiles will be played.

It has that "more-ish just one more game to see if I can do better" feel about it, especially because each game only takes 15 minutes or so. With a bunch of play under your belt though, where you're playing high scoring patterns, playing the odds correctly on what's likely to come out in the remainder, you realise how much luck the final tile or two can bear on your score.

While cleaning up my collection, I was a little surprised that both my young boys were curious about this old design. Thankfully one round is short enough for their attention but admittedly their love for jigsaws may have generated longer interest in the tile laying process. Again, their competitiveness ruined the vibe of the first session as the younger one believed it was a race to find the tile called out; this issue was resolved by making either of them and not me be the one picking the numbers. Still a good activity to go over multiples with the eldest, but haven't got to adding the double digit scores yet.

Mathematical puzzle Bingo which has the distinctive feature in that the number of players can be unlimited. Much groaning and tile calling towards game end makes this more fun than expected, but the summing is such a bore, unless you wish to exercise multiplication and adding large numbers.

Maths-based game, but don't let that put you off.  It's a fun challenge how best to fit your pieces together to maximise your scoring potential.  Good to get kids to learn their times tables without feeling didactic.  Luck involved because of the tiles, so adults don't have any advantage over kids in this game.

I've also tried Take it Higher!, which has 8-sided tiles instead of 6 so one more direction for which you have to sort your paths out, but it doesn't feel that much harder in practice.  Both good - we just happened to find this version second hand so bought that.

Jogo bestial, com muita tensão e muito "gambling", cujo objectivo principal é ser-se mais organizado que todos os outros, ou, pelo menos, fazer mais pontos que todos eles. Apesar de ser um jogo em cada um joga por si, sem qualquer interacção ou escolha que possa prejudicar outrém, tem algum factor sorte, embora numa quantidade bastante agradável. Recomendo!

Played by the whole room at Oasis of Fun 2009 & 2010.

Bingo meets a variant of Hex. Each player gets a hex map and a number of hex tiles with three lines running through them. Each line is numbered 1-9 (and color coordinated to make it easier). The caller randomly pulls out tiles and calls out their numbers. Players place their copy of that tile in any empty spot they like.

When the board is full, players add up their scores. A same-colored (and same-numbered) line that goes from one edge of the board to the other will score. Lines that do not connect edge to edge do not score. The number of tiles that are used in that line (3-5) is multiplied by the number of that line (1-9). The score for each line is added up.

It's a fine large group filler. Bunch of luck and some strategy choices.

RATING: 6
Crazy spatial bingo-style puzzle game. Game takes place over four rounds and each round, players place 19 randomly selected  (called out bingo style by the active player) in order to connect lines that criss-cross the tiles. Once all 19 have been placed on a board, any fully connected lines are scored by multiplying the length of the line by the value of the line. Player with the highest score wins. There is some amount of tension with the gambling for huge scores and hoping your much needed high scoring tile gets selected. Good party game but the theme is rather dull.

RATING: 3.5
Clearly, this is a fantastic game for other people to play as a filler. It has a big advantage in that it is quick and it accommodates 8 people. I'm sure that people are going to be better at this game than others, for me though I felt that the game is just trying to play to the best odds to score the most points. There is little foresight to the game, in many ways the game is reminiscent of everything I hate about Carcassonne, draw a tile see if it fits, repeat. Only now you when it can't fit it ruins your position. I think that the system is more fascinating than fun, especially at the end when you see the divergent scores. I think perhaps this would be much more entertaining to watch than to play, or perhaps not...

Still, it is over so quick that it is almost inoffensive.

A fun game to play with up to 6 that goes fast.  While it has the feel of bingo, it's really more of a press-your-luck pattern matching game.  Plenty of enjoyment packed into just a few minutes!  Only downside is that a calculator is needed to tabulate the final scores (literally!).

RATING: 6
It's surprising how badly I do at this game!

Everyone has the same set of hex tiles, which have numbers on 3 lines crossing the tile. The caller draws a random tile -- everyone else places it somewhere on their play mat. The game is over when the play area is full. Score points = (# on hex) * (# hexes in that line, from edge to edge of play area) IF all numbers on the line match. Sum all your points -- highest total wins!

There are some great games where whatever decision you make, it's the wrong one.  This may be the original.

I love simultaneous play games, and puzzle games, and this is both.  My strategy is to try to create the pattern of the maximum possible score, if not the numbers, so that I never want to have the same tile in two different places.

The spatial challenge of the game as the board grows smaller and smaller has its own appeal.  It's like Bingo meets a math problem, and each player has the same opportunity to play the best they can.  In addition, it makes a good tournament game, since any number of players can play simultaneously, so long as you have enough sets to spread among everyone.

It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game -- so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. "The 9-8-7," for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.
\13\\13\
The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example... but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.
\13\\13\
Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes. Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.

When I think "easy" and "take," I'm thinking of margaritas, not suffocating brain exercises.

It is a problem-solving puzzle in which all players are competing to come up with the best solution. You are making real decisions, but the rules are clear and easy so anyone 8-10 and older can start playing immediately. Nice little game.

This game is short, easy and fun.  There isn't a lot of depth to the strategy.

A Bingo-like game with actual player decision involved?  What a concept!  Easy to teach and fast to play.  One is often faced with the tough choice between which line to keep alive and which to sacrifice.  Definitely a filler I would see myself coming back to occasionally.

Fun.  Fun fun fun.  Harder than it first appears.  It's a great 15-minute game that accomodates up to eight.

This game is a very fun combination of luck and thinking logical. It’s impossible to plan, because of the luck involved. You could explain this game in less then 5 minutes, and then start to play. Very nice components. Fun filler game.

Mind challenging and fun. Good filler. Prefer it than Can't Stop.

After 1 Play: A neat idea and very cleanly executed, but victory seems highly dependent on early, almost arbitrarily chosen placements.

Just OK for me. More of an exercise to keep children quiet than a game I wish to play.

Puzzle, matemáticas y bingo. Coloca la ficha sacada de la bolsa en tu tablero tratando de cada "tubo" tenga un solo color (y valor) ya que solo ellos darán PV igual a su valor por el largo.

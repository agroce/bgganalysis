The mechanics all work but it's a bit dry and all tactics and no strategy (not my type of game). It is also hard to really judge whether you really are in control of your moves or not. The plus side is that it can be played in under 45 mins but the desire to play is not really there.

What i like most about game like this is that those who try to work it out will lose, and I inagine it will be disliked by them [see the lower rating comments]. Interesting how everyone says the turns are always the same when in our first play we had one turn totally unlike all the others, caused by a single player's choice.

This is a very enticing game with plenty to think about  it. The luck factor is slightly higher than I would like, as your starting position in each round can dominate your choices unless you get the money (guards) right.

Didn't do much for me - the turn order ranking feels odd - you can spend tons of guards not really accomplish anything.  I didn't like the fulfillment phase - seemed unintuitive.

This game immediately ran true for me.  The mechanisms and the scoring system clicked right away - but I will freely acknowledge that I suspect it won't for most players.  To get the game working, you need to plan your moves with 2 - 3 phases in mind.  The city you secure and the income and types it brings need to be selected with the delivery and timing in mind.  This move combination drives a particular strategy style that I really like.  There are some issues with the game that can be offsetting, but overall, it is a fine game.

Very much an 'experience game'.  Players are involved all the time and there is much groaning as the initial areas are bid for.  There is a nice balance to the game and it is fun to play.  There are six game year turns.  Goods are placed in the royal stores or estate stores, giving players the influence required to win the game.  You even get to place your opponent's goods in the stores.  Rating handicapped slightly because of the feeling of the game playing the player rather than the other way round.

Több nagyon jó ötlet is van a játékban, de valahogy mégse mondanám, hogy maga a játék is nagyon jó. De azért az a kategória így is, amihez szívesen leülök máskor is...
A licit részben van egy újdonság, a távolságért fizetni kell... Ettől kicsit tematikus lesz az egész, de pont ez teszi kicsit nehézkessé (igazságtalanná?!), lehetne letisztultabb...
A másik ami nem hiányzott, az néhány helyen a szerencse szerepe (pl. random dől el minden kör elején, melyik város lesz jó vagy kevésbé jó, illetve melyik nem játszik egyáltalán...). Az eladásnál nagyon jó ötlet a lovas rész (legjobb lovas ér oda elsőként), a mi partinkban egyértelműen azok végeztek jobban, akik a kártyákra mentek rá, és nem a direkt pontokra.
Összességében nem rossz, de ha ma csinálná a szerző, szerintem ütősebb, kiforrottabb lenne.

Read someone's excellent review.  Sounds really interesting.  Seems to be a quick game that is done in 60 minutes.  Seems to be in the same niche as Notre Dame and Ra for depth and time invested.  Works as an appetizer before the main entre.  Shows a lot of promise.  Would love to actually see the rules to read to make sure I didn't miss anything.

League of Six has some randomness to the setup for each round, but after everything is set, you get to make some interesting choices.  Deciding how to orientate the tiles for the best combination of goods relative to the other players was fun.  However, the random setup at the beginning of each round can arbitrarily hinder certain players more than others, which in turn gives certain players an advantage in guards.  In spite of the randomness, I overall enjoyed being a tax collector.

Just played this again over the weekend so I thought I would comment on it. I really like Euro games like this. I like to call them "structured". Basically, each phase of a turn is very clear and each phase offers different sorts of tough decisions. This is another highly rated game from me by Vladimir Suchy, who is becoming one of my favorite designers. You collect cubes from 1 of several cities each round and then add them to score either VP or cards that give majority bonuses for different figures on them at games end. The interactive part of the game lies in adding the cubes. The phasing player (determined by how many horses they received from their city when they also got goods) picks 1 row from 8 and adds as many cubes as they can and then each player in clockwise order MUST also add as many cubes as they can. If the row is completed, then whomever started the row gets the VP or card bonus. You can really do some major screwage here. Despite it's dry as the desert theme and mediocre components, this game is super fun. A highly interactive Euro that scales 3-5 players and plays in under an hour, good stuff.

I played this at BGG.Con and really liked it. As often as it seems to be done, it's really hard for me to fathom that someone would apply a theme of collecting taxes. But Seyfarth did it equally unfathomably (delivering mail? :shake: ) with Thurn and Taxis, so who am I to judge? For my money, I'd much rather play League of Six.The arrows on the hex dials number from two to five. Since the dials come out randomly a given round [i]could[/i] come out primarily composed of a low of 2-3 arrow hexes or primarily composed of high 4-5 arrow hexes, but more often than not it's a mix of low and high. The symbols on each hex might come out guard, good, horse, or civic-leader heavy depending on how they end up matching to the towns. It's the mix of low and high hexes (which seemed common in the games I played) that really seems to get the tension going. So perhaps not an arc, but maybe wild series of ups and downs.I think the key is in generally recognizing what's plentiful and what is not in each round and then remembering such when it comes to play the next round. Guard heavy rounds will be particularly contentious and in that way will make for more difficult predictions of outcome. Given that the game is about collecting taxes, I find that particularly appropriate. Whoever said nothing in life is certain but death and taxes surely wasn't speaking from the point of view of a competing tax collector!Well yes, by good I meant fastest. The only use of horses is for the purpose of choosing first which row will be scored. I wouldn't completely discount the value of being second, or even third for horses either. It's not the main focus either. One has to balance choice of horses with supply of guards to be used in the next turn and with supply of good received this turn. If you only focus on horses then you will probably come up a little short on guards or goods. If you focus on getting the most goods, then you will probably be compromising on guards and horses. You may not be able to maximize your VPs because of the horse situation, but you will still get a lot of VPs for those goods just the same.I see why you would call this filler, it's not a deep game, but there are lots of variables to consider when making decisions. This is a game where you are clearly playing against other players, not against the game. There's a lot of being at the mercy of the other players in this game both in the delivery phase and in the town selection phase. The town selection phase is outright extortion. This simply isn't a game for for players who feel uncomfortable muscling other players or being muscled themselves.

Others say: 6 rounds of repetition, almost entirely tactical, very dry, mechanical.

Snoozefest says: A pretty cool auction mechanism where the overbidder pays the person they overbid (who then can move elsewhere with extra cash in hand). You score VP by placing cubes, completing lines of cubes, and collecting sets of card symbols (which you get by completing lines of cubes); these are hidden and score by rank at end of game. With so many options, its difficult to predict what will happen - seems a bit chaotic. Still, very neat game.

RATING: 3
Dry, mechanical and dull, with a theme that doesn't really fit the mechanics. Heart of the game is the auction, where you bid your guards by positioning them on the current town or move them to another and bump someone else out (bit like Amun-Re), in Amun-Re this works, there is tension and it's over fairly quick and there are other bits to the game that are interesting too. With League the bidding is pretty much the game, everything else is very obvious.

I like the theme (relatives live in this rather unnkown region of Germany/Poland). Gorgeous material with nice little details (e.g. the horse markers that fit on the players cards or the hexagonal tax markers). Interesting mechanisms, although not always original (bidding for cities reminds me of Amun Re, the delivery to the warehouses somewhat resembles the Captain's phase of PR as you manipulate what the others have to ship, in order to make the relatively bigger gain). I especially like the tax markers with their arrows, that restrict what taxes to take but leave enough room for manipulation.

Completely soulless. The biggest change in my tastes in gaming over the past 2-3 years is that I now recognize that I just cannot get at all excited about themeless games. Yeah, there is stuff in League of Six that is clever, and some of the decisions are interesting, and at least it's short, but it's totally mechanical - virtually nothing of what you do makes any thematic sense nor does the game engage you in a role or allow any kind of intuitive play - you just have to do the math on everything. Which is boring. I don't need a *ton* of theme to be happy - just a little bit, some kind of attempt - but League of Six doesn't have even that.

And even if it did - tax collectors? Who wants to play a game where you get to be a tax collector? Whose bright idea was that?

I liked the game quite a bit, but man does it ever bog down during the bidding phase!  The bidding can take seemingly forever to resolve, with loads of downtime as you wait for it to shake out.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the game of collecting goods in order to make deliveries for points, while getting enough horses to ensure the desired delivery, and getting enough soldiers to bid with in the next round.

I give the game theme props for using Guards as a currency device.  The bidding for cities is very fun as you can normally get people to give you money (guards) to travel along to other cities.  The filling out of the gem orders is kind of 'meh'.  Decent game.  The expansion for this one sounds like it adds a ton.

--Update: I wouldn't play this game without the expansion.  The town tiles giving special powers should be part of the base game.

Quite a good game with some new mechanics. A game for thinkers, well balanced ... so why no higher rating?
In my opinion this one last a little too long for what it offers. There's a lot of downtime (yes, I disagree with some geeks here) when some people fight for control over a certain city while you are sitting and waiting that either someone enters your city or everyone is done and game can proceed to the next step.
Would alwas recommend to play it with six players using the material of the expansion (haven't tried the expansion rules yet) because then there's more tension in the game.

Interesting twist on the auction mechanic from Amun-Re. On the first play, I felt like the game could have ended after maybe 4 turns instead of 6 with no objection from me, but maybe it just felt draggy since we were all learning. If that really is the case, there's nothing that needs to be changed about the gameplay to accomodate a change.

I got League of Six at Spiel 2007 after a very quick partial demo with just 3 players, but my girlfriend and I liked the general playing rythm to the point where we decided the risk was worth it. After a far too long hiatus, I was able to get this game to the table in a 4-player setting, and I was happy to conclude that the feeling of the demo had persisted. Unfortunately, repeated playings led to a waning of interest as some worrying tendencies began to assert themselves.

It may look so simple, but hiding beneath its simple exterior is a hard muscling-in-on-eachother's-turf kinda game. First the players dish it out to determine which city they will be taxing, but they bribe and extort each other in the process. If played cleverly, one player can use the please-move-out bribe of one player to finance [i]his[/i] please-move-out bribe in another town. The upshot is that he is very cheaply piggybacking on the flow of guards—payment—and saving a lot of points in the process. This is clever, true, but also very dangerous as an agressive player can cause such violent fluctuations that one or more players are simply locked out of the game. They don't have the guards to bribe others, and are likely not getting them either because they are forced to unimportant towns from which they cannot claw back. The little power plays are interesting to watch, but being the butt of them is definitely not fun—to the point of wanting to quit, really. After everyone's place has been determined, you get to tax the city, resulting in various goods. These are then transported to the royal or civic vaults, and even here players get to interfere with one another.

I found it hard to get a feeling for this game, and for some reason I never managed to utilise the piggyback-trick; I was always being siphoned off of my guards (read: I was always the butt). I also didn't really like the somewhat long playing time, which is destined to worsen with 5: what you need to do isn't difficult, but it must be done in succession. Only experience can help here. Then there is a slightly lingering doubt about turn-to-turn differences: basically you're doing the same thing for 6 turns in a row, with only points, guards and turn order being carried over into the next turn. Planners hate this—look at the comments of 5 and lower—but at the same time it is pretty obvious this game is simply not about planning. At first I liked this game, and when played with 3 it is tame and quiet and altogether a bit boring. But with increasing number of players the swings in fortune are so capricious that it ruins any fun I might have derived from it. So this game turned out to be a case of 'wrong first impressions'.

[b]Update[/b] Upon a repeated playing with 5 players, I decided to attempt a different tactic: immediately occupying a 'worthless' city, subject to the condition that it had lots of horses so I could determine where the goods were delivered, and only attempting a good city if I had sufficient guards to make it interesting. I scored a huge end-of-game bonus by having the majority in all three social classes, but still came about 10 to 12 points short of the players who grabbed lots of cubes. I could have played a little more efficiently by memorising the social classes cards, but the effort would have been pretty much for naught all the same. Cubes are everything as the cumulative value will swamp everything else even if you have few horses. If you manage to obtain many (± 5–7) cubes in more than half of the rounds, you win. There was also one player—thankfully not me this time—who began to fall behind by round three, and could not get back in a meaningful way. I enjoyed myself better, but I still maintain that this game is rigged in some way, and thus not very pleasant for at least one player.

[b]Update 2[/b] Eventually sold off.

RATING: 2
Really awful turn order mechanic- whoever goes last is going to have to pay more for everything, and get overbid least (thus getting fewer guards to bid with).  Since whoever pays most goes last next turn, it's a downward spiral that there's really no way to escape from.  Add to that the immense amount of luck associated with where the sieges happen and the good hexes go, and what colored people come up, and it feels almost like a complete crap-shoot.

The bribery-auction at the start of each round is fantastic and brutal, particularly because movement bleeds guards from the system / adds positional consideration. Remember that you can get additional guards by spending points!

The taxation system is a really neat way of doing variable city production.

The goods delivery seemed really intriguing, but in practice I didn't find it nearly as engaging as I'd hoped. Most of the time the only big question was "how far down in the horse order do we get before getting bonuses is no longer possible?" The variable per-good points were tiny deltas that seemed to average out over time, but took folks a while to think about.

Finally, there's not much arc. The rounds feel different more due to the randomly varied production than anything else.

There's lots of novel stuff going on here; I liked many of the pieces a great deal, but am lukewarm on the meshed-together whole.

Players are tax collectors for the "League of Six" towns in 15th century Europe.  Simple influence/collection game played over six turns.  Players jockey for which town to draw taxes from this turn, bribing and ousting other players, until it all settles down and everyone has a town each.  Then the town is "taxed" and players draw resources.  The taxes are then returned to the main board for instant prestige or long term influence for end of game payoffs.  Nice, tightly designed game that should play in an hour once everyone has seen it.  Draws heavily on other games (Amun-Re's auctions and Puerto Rico's forced shipping sprang immediately to mind), but feels like it's own beast.  Good stuff.

Slightly over-long rules hide a really good, simple game with three distinct mechanisms that gamers will ponder over. There's a bidding up process with guards that works very well, there's a tax mechanism that really draws on turn order (decided in part by the previous bidding), and then there's a scoring mechanism which seemed the simplest/weakest element of the game. We got one rule wrong in the last part, but it didn't make a material difference. The decision making in the first 2 parts was very dependent on the other player's responses, and key to the game was the ability to pay back VPs to gain guards to outbid someone. This was a crucial balance in the game and one person's choice would ripple through the round, affecting everyone in turn. Very entertaining. Experienced gamers will recognise elements of Amun Re and Evo in Lof6, and a few others, but as a whole it was very satisfying and original. Beware of Analysis Paralysis, but if you're a hrdened gamer, you will like this. Before The Wind is better, but Lof6 will give you a lot to think about.

Fun, short game which begs for particular tactics from the players.  These can be roughly divided into three areas; collecting resources, guards or horses.  Each has its advantages and uses in the long-term strategy; careful balance of these will make or break your game.

The guards mechanism works quite well; a single player can force everybody else to pay if they play astutely, or land themselves in a one-horse town if they don't.

(Rating is for the game with the extension.) This is a very mechanic game. At its heart is an interesting bidding system reminiscent of Amun Re, with the addition of a "movement cost" that you have to pay when outbidded. Another complementary mechanism is the strange resource board. It takes some time to get to understand how this one works. When you do, however, the game can slow down quite a bit as you have to evaluate what can be filled.

I tend to like games that ask you to "understand the system", but this one may be overdoing it, with too much abstraction and too many little subsystems.

Érdekes a licitálós központi mechanizmus. Mivel a vesztes kapja a felajánlott őröket, így aztán nem is olyan rossz licitet veszteni, sőt kifejezetten érdemes is rájátszani. Ügyesen lavírozva simán meg lehet szerezni a nekünk legértékesebb területet úgy, hogy közben az őreink száma csak gyarapodott.
Viszont sajnos az érdekes alapokra egy elég érdektelen játékot sikerült építeni. Nem igazán kötött le, pedig elvileg szerintem az ilyen játékokat. Valahogy sok a regisztrálgatás, a négyféle!! játékossorrendet se egyszer karbantartani. Szóval inkább középszerűnek mondanám.

The heart of the game is the auction-like bribery going on in order to tax a specific city. To do so in a meaningful manner you would have to be able to properly gauge the value of the lots. The resource conversion stage, however, feels largely arbitrary unless you're very early in turn order. Turn order is itself decided by player actions so it's not like you can't influence that but there's only so many players who can be early in turn order on any given turn.

Typical euro / cube pusher, only less so.  The game was a bit too inscrutable for my tastes.  At the end, I came in fourth but there was nothing in my mind that I was replaying to say 'what if'.  I'm not even sure what the winner did to win.  Not building toward anything, so no sense of accomplishment nor story in the game at all.  Perhaps I'm just not smart enough for this game, but it didn't make me want to play it again.  The decisions didn't strike me as especially interesting.  Not that they were easy - just that I wasn't necessarily having fun with the game.  The theme was pasted on, but it seems that they went out of their way to find the most obscure and least interesting theme they could find.  At least for my part of the world.  A lot of work for not much fun.

Maybe I'm getting jaded... first you collect resources, then you spend them.  The ways you get them and spend them are somewhat new... but it's just more cube pushing and card flipping with two ways to get points which you must balance to win.  I can't even tell you what the theme is here... it's so pasted-on as to be irrelevant.  And of course, being "one of those kinds of euros" it's got a friendly photo-finish (both my games ended with the last player within 5 points of the leader in a 50 point game).  Yawn.

The bidding mechanism is great, really unique and beauttiful, but we just wanted to end the game after the first 3 ,,I" sets of tiles were gone. :(

Good interactions, clever mechanisms, a solid Eurogame.  With 5p you can either try to analyse all the cities values to determine how many guardsthey are 'worth', or you can play more intuitively without the brain-burn, just calculating the horses.  Doesn't have a 'wow, must play again' factor, but I am looking forward to getting a few more plays in over time.

The bidding is Vegas Showdown with a positional element and the annoying inability to make an opening bid above zero.  The contents of the lots and how you spend them is cleverly determined but arbitrary. There is little thematic sense, and not the faintest whisper of narrative.  There was NO game arc. There was no sense of doing anything more than trying to be clever with cards and cubes; there was no "why".  I enjoy many abstracts, card games, and "dry" Euros, but this was an hour of "clever mechanics" and almost no fun at all.

Not bad, but not brilliant neither. Quite generic eurogame. Interesting bidding mechanics, but getting goods (to sell them later in stores) is very unintuitive. What is dissapointing, every round goes pretty much the same - you just have different number of soldiers, probably more cards with people and there are different resources available.
Besides, memorizing how many soldiers or citizens other players accumulated is tiresome.

Event though there is a bit of downtime especially in a 4 player game it's an very enjoyable medium weight eurogame.

Only the bidding for the city phase may drag (according to your fellow players) a bit when they're slow.2 games played with 4/5 players. I am eager to try it with the expansion.

It is interesting and quite enjoyable, especially with 4 (my 3-player game did not feel adequate, especially with respect to the placement of cubes at the end of a phase). Nice work, certainly. Compared to other games that it somewhat resembles (bidding-for-resources types like Amun-Re, or getting-rid-of-cubes-through-competition types like Puerto Rico), however, it doesn't excite me as much, because I prefer more tension stemming from real and critical stakes and the risk of losing severly through the wrong decisions, and also more strategic depth that comes when things are "built" and events or resources "carry over" from one round to another. But I'd be happy to play again, and the game doesn't overstay its welcome.

(Only played once, 5-player)

Having the rules explained before playing, it sounded quite complicated, but while playing we encountered no problems, the rules are actually really easy.

The game has six rounds. During the second round I already felt myself wondering how long it would go on for.

Each round consists of two phases. Firstly there's something 'auction-like' to determine what resources you'll receive, this part is uninteresting and could potentially go on forever. The second phase, wherein you utilize your resources, I liked more; however if you're not first in line there're not many choices left.

No desire at all to play this game again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Over all I really enjoyed it. I do think the opening bid should be anything and not just one. If you are low on money it’s a bit hard to get an area and if you could at least bid up, you could get some money flowing back to you. Otherwise you could go a few turn without being able to get what you need (anything you need).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Slighty dry euro, but the auction mechanism is a lot of fun and the # of choices vs. complexity is spot on. Major drawback is that there's not enough build-up during the game. Each of the six rounds merely seem like more of the same.

RATING: 4
This is a pretty boring game. You bid, you collect, you score... seen that a thousand times before and in much more interesting forms.

You can play the game the math way (counting everything), but I'm sure it will kill the game even more since it will drag it much more, while it won't add anything.

Lots of pieces to move around, but the multiple paths to victory are nice. Probably best with an even number of players- with an odd number whatever of the two strategies (burghers or shipping to the king) that has two people going for it (with 3 going for the other) will have the winner.

Poorly planned turns can really make you feel very helpless as others force you to use your resources, but that part of the game is what brings in the vast majority of the strategic depth.

[Initial Impression: 2; Unlikely to play again]
Complaining about this game is far more fun than actually playing it. (The best move of the game was when one player bowed out after the rules explanation.) Auctions can become an evil way to suck guards out of players and then bully them on later turns, but the decisions in the market phase seem obvious and ultimately both trivial and pointless. The game is effectively just another poorly inspired exemplar of the "get this resource and trade it for another to trade for points" genre. Terminally boring in almost every way, except the little spinner mechanism is cool. My guess would be that an actual tax collector's job is more fun, and they can at least spin a pencil on their desk during *every* phase!

This was brilliant! The auction mechanic is like nothing in any other game I've seen and works really nicely, there are multiple paths to getting victory points and it's full of tough decisions that aren't too complicated. Only slight downside is that there are so many parts to it, I like games to be simplistic with few bits but this never feels complicated or bitty once it's set up.

Why oh why does this game score so low?

First game with 3. League of Six has a lot going for it; the theme is (potentially) interesting - not many games are set during the Hussite wars, there are some unusual mechanics, and the game plays smoothly and quickly but involves a fair amount of decision-making. However, I suspect that the game will not work as well with more than 3 players; with 3, you can at least plan ahead for the Turn. And the theme, besides involving the less-than-thrilling prospect of being a tax collector, is totally divorced from the game itself.

Only one issue could be implemented better: putting goods into stores.  I fear that there are no very interesting decisions here.

EDIT: After 9 plays it has burnt out for me (only 2 strategies: immediate VPs or majorities in citizen groups).  That's where the 'Loyal Retinue' expansion comes to the rescue.  I can't imagine playing without it any more.

RATING: 6
The ultimate Leap-frog game! Kudos to the designer for coming out with a very original and engaging game. I don't think a signal mechanic is borrowed and even though there are some slight similarities to other games overall this game as a whole can't really be compared to anything because it isn't like anything else. 

The core of the game does have an auction mechanic that bears some resemblance to either Amun-re or the Princess and Muse expansion auction of POF however the 'leap-frogging' here outdoes both of those! This was indeed the best part of the game, let me explain. In a 5 player game there will be 6 towns around the central board, right off the hop one of these is randomly eliminated so now there are only 5, one for each player.  Now a hex tile will be randomly placed on each city, this tile determines how many "goods" will be up for grabs in each city, the catch is the tile has a number of arrows that point outward and whatever they point to is what you get.  The neat part of this is the tile can be rotated which gives you a couple or a few different ways to split up the 'pie'. (* Note that even though I mentioned the word 'random', no randomness has effected anyone as so far no one has committed to anything and even though someone could be in a 'bad spot' he will have the chance to move, the aforementioned randomness is there more to ensure replayability and there is extra stuff included in the box so things will be different game to game). 

Once this initial distribution is done and the players have looked it over, starting with the first player you bid a number of your "guards" (aka money) for the town you want albeit the first person in a town has to bid 0.  Now the next person can go to a different town and pay 0 or outbid anyone else on a town already occupied.  When a person is outbid he can then re-bid to stay or he can accept the bid and gets paid that amount in guards.  What happens when he gets paid is that now he has money to go and outbid someone else in another town, this is how the game can now become a giant game of leap-frog, in fact a viable strategy is to go to some towns just to be outbid so you can collect a bunch of money.  Inevitable there will usually be one town weaker than the rest whether a little or a lot and in the end someone has to take this last town so the bidding phase can end, it can go one for a bit but it is fun to watch or participate in and as I mentioned I thought it was the best part of the game.

You are trying to collect either guards, horses, or various goods.  Guards are money, goods are used to either get points in a later phase or to help collect sets of cards which will also score points at the end of the game.  Horses are quite important as the most will grant first choice in the main scoring/collection phase, why this is so important is because of how that phase works.  There will be 8 different 'shelves' to fill up in one of two warehouses,  whoever starts the first shelf by putting the necessary resources for that shelf in it does NOT have to finish it.  When he doesn't finish it now it goes to the next player and he HAS to finish it if he can, if he doesn't it goes to the next player and so on.  What happens here is first of all whoever STARTS the shelf gets a 'bonus' of some kind when it gets finished, what also happens is by going last in this selection phase you may very well have no goods left when it comes to your turn to choose thanks to you having to finish other people's shelves, nasty! 

Well that is most of the game, lots of interaction, little to no downtime, some set collection and lots of things to watch out for and keep your eye on.  Lacks long tem planning for the most part as it is a round by round kind of game, it is far more tactical however the tactical game is fun and the game only lasts about an hour.  Overall even though it is original and interactive it comes out as mostly average with the lack of any planning maybe being the biggest negative. 5 players most likely best and then 4.

Nice medium-weight euro, where players tax towns for goods cubes which are then converted into VP. The mechanism that really stands out in the game is the auction for towns, which feels both somewhat similar to that of, say, Amun-Re, but is still different enough that it requires a completely different approach.

My first impression of the game was good - but not so good that I bought the game.

Solid and enjoyable - but won't be remembered as something special.   Bid Amun-Re style to get control of a city.  Each city pays out colored cubes and some other goodies.  There is a worthwhile mechanism that gives you limited control of exactly what you take in your city - especially a painful choice between cubes and turn order.Then there is a phase where you spend your cubes for points in a mechanic which has has a vague resemblance to shipping in Puerto Rico.Repeat six times.Better than I make it sound - but sufficiently tactical to limit it's long term appeal (said after a single playing).

RATING: 5
League of Six is another entry into the category of Eurogames that recycle every known mechanism and combine them into a Frankenstein type of game. I'm talking about Il Principe, Ystari games and other of its kin. My problem with these games is that I usually have no clue about the relation between the end scores and each individual's decisions. There are so many interlocking parts that the result feels arbitrary. A prime candidate for this in League of Six is the relation between the city selection to collect taxes and the sale of the tax goods to the market to generate VPs. The market is almost unplannable with the full complement of five players. Hence, the usual strategy for city selection is ignoring which individual goods you get and simply aiming for the city that offers the most taxes overall this turn degrading the auction into a tactical exercise of money management. 
Things get better with four players but at the same time the focus shifts from most taxes to most horses with as much as possible other taxes as only two or three players will be able to gain row completion bonusses. I enjoy it more with four players as there's more control and the relation between city selection and victory point generation is visible. It also became clear that the game will be decided in the city auction. You don't want to win the first auction for a city just to be removed in another auction later on. Having no knights on your hand for future auctions puts you in the defense while having a hand full of knight cards lets you control the game.
I had fun with League of Six although it is dry, strictly tactical and a bit repetitive with six almost equal turns that only differ in the amount of money (i.e. knight cards) available to the players. I doubt though that I will have many chances to get LoS to the table again and won't be too sad about it.

A solid effort - lacking in thematic originality, though I like the idea that you are a tax collector using guards to protect you rather than an aristocrat using money to elbow your way around.  Not that there's any difference in the gameplay, but at least that part is original.  I like this method of bidding much more than in Amun Re, to which it is most often compared.  There is a lot more flexibility, since the money switches hands, encouraging a greater amount of bouncing back and forth between cities, trying to get more money (oops, I mean, recruit more guards) to come back and win what you really want.  

I find the second half a little less interesting, since the choices are fairly obvious once filling a row is no longer an option.  Before then, the power of the different aristocrat majorities is not to be underestimated.

If I can get the game time down on this one, I think I will enjoy it a lot more - at heart it is a fairly simple game.  You can overanalyze, but is it really worth it?

Traded away.

A stylish mixture of mechanisms from many well-known and admired games. You can easily find pieces of at least Puerto Rico, Amun-Re, Princes of Florence and Taj Mahal here. Mechanically there is very little that is really new and therefore it didn't feel like anything spectacular. Also, when playing with people who tend to over-optimize, League of Six could become a really long game.

Good tactical auction game. The auction mechanism adds a few interesting twists by having you pay the person who you beat and enforcing an additional cost when moving to another auction. The auctions are represented by cities in which you raise taxes (different taxes in each city and during each round). Concentrate on the horses, because going first to the wharehouse is an advantage. Overall, the game play gets a bit repetitive.

Its definitely a cube pushing Euro but it also has some interesting mechanisms in play that appear unique or different.  Not only do you fight for the right to tax a city for varying amounts of goods, troops, and horses; you also must then sell your goods at a market for victory points and/or special figures cards which grant bonus scoring at the end of the game.  I think my biggest concern about this game is that the devil is in the details, and there is very limited control in those details quite frequently.  This game is almost too well balanced as most everyone usually ends up within a couple points of the victor.

A very challenging game, having a very high "Damn you !!!" level.  The winner is considered a tactical mastermind in our group.  The only multi-player game we have in our collection that tops the suspense level of powergrid (till now every end game ended up with all 5 standing upright through the last round).  According to the tactical mastermind this game is no good for people suffering heart diseases.
Strengths: 
+ the superb new auction system (is this still an auction ?)
+ the "damn you" factor used to "sell" the goods.

After 1 play, I like the way the mechanics of the game work together. The bits, boards and cards are nice although in dim light hard to tell the civic leaders apart esp brown and purple. We didn't have much bidding over the cities. It will be interesting to see if/how what cities you tax relate to the scoring goods cards. In first play it seems the most obvious choice is to go for most horses and get first pick. The 2 people who tied for first did seem to get first scoring choice most often and I won on the tie breaker most guards. I enjoyed the mechanisms and the way they incorporated them, but the choices seemed fairly obvious and lacked that bit of tension to make it feel really challenging. Played with 4 and might be better with 5. At this point I'm not sure on replayability or other strategies so a 7 for now. A more interesting game when bidding is competitive.

RATING: 6.4
Starts with an unusual auction mechanic and then you get to chose some variable goods. The meat of the game is in the market where you exchange the goods for outright victory points or the possibility of big points later while sharing some victory points with other players who help you meet these goals. The horses are cute but seem a little pointless since you can see right on the board in what order you go.

This is another game that my dad managed to find several copies of for cheap at a local thrift store which he picked up mostly because it was a 'Czech Games' product and we are of Czech descent - naturally he was thrilled to discover that it actually did have a Czech Medieval theme/setting.

Basically, each player is a tax collector for the King, travelling amongst the six cities of the cleverly named "League of Six", competing to deliver the most valuable taxes to the King's warehouses.

I like this game a lot and the fact that I've played it so infrequently is not a poor reflection on it at all.  There's a good level of strategy present with trying to manipulate the turn order, which cities to visit, and planning ahead based on what goods/taxes are in demand at the King's warehouse.  Plus, it's not a long game either - so you can get a couple of plays in under 2 hours.

The reasons that I haven't played this more are twofold: 1) the fact that this is a 3-5 player game means that my Wife and I can't play by ourselves - there is a two-player fan made variant out there - but you really need three players for this game to be enjoyable; and 2) my brothers-in-law (whom I primarily play against in 3+ player games) absolutely HATE this game - probably because I committed the Cardinal Sin of beating them the first time we sat down to play (gracious losing is not their strong suit).

Family rivalries aside - this is a fun game that I'd recommend - and I myself look forward to playing more of when my son comes of age.

This game may be worse than Notre Dame.

I hated the intrisic lack of meaningful interaction in ND. ( No the "draft" mechanic isn't all that )

This game is a convoluted amalgamation of other Euros.

It fails. Ra is everything that Lo6 needs to be, but without the superfluous chrome, the niggling initiative system and the needless repetitiion - 6 rounds? really? Aren't we just playing the game twice... 

This works its way into the group of "worst games I tried in 2009

After three plays, I am starting to wonder at all the hype surrounding this game.  Everyone who has played it says that having the fastest horses is the key to winning.  Every winner has generally had fastest horses the majority of the game.  

Another issue I have is the difficulty one encounters in planning a move, which results in seemingly random results. It is almost impossible to gauge what goods your opponents are likely to pick, thus making it difficult to plan for the best "screwage," so to speak.

This is one of those games in which I appreciate the mechanics yet the gameplay does not excite me. I found it difficult to properly strategize (by looking ahead to the gem phase during the auction phase) without spending an inordinate amount of time (which I'm unwilling to do). As such I found it difficult to properly value what I was bidding on and would often bail early to take something weak. The gem phase felt especially mechanical to me and scoring was unexciting. Not a bad game by any means. It just fell flat for me.

The latest in a long line of samey Euros. It leans heavily on the Amun Re bidding method, but the game completely lacks the spark of a Knizia. An utterly depressing, irrelevant and tedious theme - "collect taxes for the king", combines with pedestrian game play which drags on slightly too long. It seems as though the designer wrote down a chart of the kind of game that people on BGG like and then attempted to tick the boxes. I must admit that it does look quite nice, and I did find myself getting into it as we approached the end, but really I have little desire to play this again, as it offers no more than the other 150 euros you already own where you are efficiently managing your resources and making decisions that throw your neighbours plans into disarray for a couple of minutes. Move along, nothing new to see here.

First impression (5 players): A bit mixed feelings with this one. On the other hand the mechanics blend nicely together and create a unique feel on to the game. The game goes smoothly and feels good to play. The other thing is that game at the same time felt chaotic in a wrong way. It is pretty hard to see in city auction time what resources eventually will be available and how many bonuses are being able to complete. Bonuses give quite many points overall and it seems that straight-points bonus is generally always a better pick so it often feels a bit too easy choice.

I will need to play another game perhaps with 4 players to see if it would be a better experience. There was just something wrong in my first game experience (not even counting the fact that I played terribly). It's very likely that I appreciate game a lot more after second game.

LA LEGA DEI SEI - Gioco apparentemente non semplice, si rivela invece ben presto immediato e a tratti addirittura un po' banale o per lo meno ripetitivo. Malgrado le critiche che lo accompagnavano nel complesso non mi è dispiaciuto, simpatica l'asta per la scelta della posizione che (in stile 'I pilastri della terra' o 'Leonardo Da Vinci') assegna le azioni disponibili per il turno di gioco. L'assegnazione dei punti finale riprende la tematica delle maggioranze (Taj Mahal). Nel complesso un insieme di idee e meccaniche già viste così come l'ambientazione. Abbastanza veloce 60', dà il meglio giocato in 4 o 5.

It falls into the trap of standard Euro playing the same game 6 times in a row, but it has some saving graces. The first is the neat auction mechanic to determine what town each player will collect stuff from. It starts similar to the Evo/Amun-Re approach but then deviates with payouts to encourage your opposing bidder to go and bid up the price somewhere else. It ratchets things up nicely. Collect stuff, and then spend turns filling up rows a bit Puerto Rico style, where the person who opened up the row gets a nice bonus when it fills. But earning the right to get those bonuses means picking up less cubes to put on the rows, so there's nice tradeoffs to be explored. It suffers from being better with more players to make the auctions more interesting, but worse because of the extra time required to play out the non-auction phases, which is why it doesn't rate higher.

Autore ed editori Cechi, meccaniche Tedesche. Un bel giochino di piazzamento e asta con un'ambientazione - la Lega delle Sei Città dell'Alta Lusazia - che finalmente esce dal cliché dell'Italia Rinascimentale per farti conoscere qualcosa che nei libri di storia italiani è appena accennato. Il gioco è abbastanza semplice da essere usato quasi come Gateway Game, ma lo svolgimento non è per niente banale. Carina l'idea delle frecce differenti per sfruttare alcune risorse delle città, gli sforzi per accaparrarsi i cavalli migliori e il supporto dei Leader Civici a fine partita. Il meccanismo per scegliere le città da tassare - e scalzare gli avversari - bilancia le forze in campo, e il sistema di arruolamento delle guardie tramite favori reali permette ai giocatori di fare uno sforzo in più quando serve (ma è un investimento che rischia di compromettere la partita). A questo si aggiunge una buona qualità dei componenti (anche se le carte sono sottilissime), una grafica molto carina e una breve durata, corrispondente alle promesse della scatola. Come i boardgame tedeschi "puri", le meccaniche di gioco non si legano armoniosamente all'ambientazione, per cui a qualcuno potrebbe sapere troppo di astratto.

RATING: 7
League of Six is a odd auction game in which you are tax collectors bidding soldiers to see which town you can tax.  Like Amun-Re or Vegas Showdown, this is a game with multiple simultaneous auctions.  Here, though, when you outbid someone, you pay them the soldiers.  However, "moving" to a new town to bid on costs soldiers as well.  Soldiers being passed around the table and eventually draining because of move costs certainly creates an interesting dynamic.  Once you win a town, you get to take a bunch of gems, and then you go through an order fulfillment phase that can have a lot of screwage, somewhat reminiscent of the captain phase of Puerto Rico.  There really are a ton of interesting ideas in this game.

A greatly positive experience. Bidding system is covered with a lot of tactical choices and it works a lot better than the similar in Amun Re.

Clear and not so predictable gameplay with a lot of meaningful choices that affect your gameplay made this one a hit to me even though usually these games are not my type.

I would definitely play again. We had four players and that was fine. Next with five? Three?

Edit: Played with five. It had a bit downtime but definitely not too much since you really got involved with the game. Still a favourite!

RATING: 6.5
Very nice pawn placement mechanism. The core game design which relies on guards as currency breaks down with fewer players due to the travel costs rising (more covered locations which you have to travel past) combined with the decrease in total currency (guards) in the game (both at the start and available for collection at the remaining towns).

The jewel placement left me a bit flat but was well balanced.

When I first heard the theme I was interested. Hussites? - Great - wondered how the war wagons, rebellion, not to mention the religious contentions would factor. Collecting taxes for Sigismund? - Ok - I can send my thugs to wring what I can from the unhappy populace.

What I found a well crafted auction resource placement game - that is not thematic at all.

The auction phase is interesting, soldiers are used as money to move your pawn to a city and outbid another player for a city. The interesting component is that you pay the other player to leave and go somewhere else so the money changes hands. Leads to a nice set of extortion between the players. The cities are not equal since the markers allow between 2 and 5 items to be collected soldiers for the next round, horses to give player priority in the phase and resources to use.

The resource placement phase the player order is determined by the number of horses they collected. To bad these aren't like soldiers where you could play or keep for the next round but hey we're tax collectors and don't realize you have feed horses to keep them around. 
In order of horses the player picks a line of resources to fill puts in what he can for VPs and the other players around the table fill in the remainder for VPs. The player who selected the line either gets bonus VPs or a card which at the end of the game is used to determine more VPs.
While this has some element of screwage - is is primarily a min/max optimization of points for the current round.

All in all a well crafted game, but not one I'm excited about.
Plays well with 5 (with less I think the board is not competitive enough).

RATING: 7.5
A good game but it just doesn't seem to reinvent the wheel. It looks like a blend of several popular game mechanics without having a feel of it's own. The game plays very well and is enjoyable. The only small problem is the final auction phase where almost every player can bet the maximum amount of army to control a town without any competition for it. This should be revised in a future edition if there is. The rules are clear and well explained in the rule book. It plays easily around the suggested time of 90 minutes.

Bon jeu mais qui ne semble pas réinventer la roue. On dirait un mélange de mécaniques appartenant à des jeu populaires sans avoir sa propre saveur. Ceci dit, le jeu tourne bien et est plaisant. Le seule petit problème est la phase d'enchère finale ou les joueurs peuvent miser le montant maximal et acquérir une ville sans possibilité de surenchère. Ce point devrait être révisé dans les futures éditions si il y a. Les règles sont claires et bien expliquées dans le livre de jeu. Il se joue facilement selon le temps de jeu mentionné par l'éditeur de 90 minutes.

RATING: 6
I wasn't super impressed after one play. There are a lot of variables in this game. It is too much to process, and so the game almost lends itself to randomness. The decision making process basically breaks down to "more resources are better." When choosing to bid for cities, why wouldn't you bid on a city that gives you five different things rather than two? With so many variables, it's hard to make meaningful choices because it's almost impossible to tell whether particular resources are better than others. This would probably be a better game if it had less depth, since the elements don't seem integrated particularly well.

Nice game.
Only played it once so far, with 6p.
There is a lot going on and almost everything changes avery round.
So I fiund it hard to anticipate on what's to come.
But the choosing-town-fase is very fun.
It's very interactive, just pushing each other away, and so competing for the best city.

Great game with three interesting interlocking mechanisms: Amun-Re/Vegas Showdown-style auctions, dials that determine the commodities and benefits each player receives, and an unusual method of converting commodities into points by placing them in batches on chart tiles. Not too difficult to learn and relatively fast-paced, this is one of the best Essen 2007 releases.

RATING: 7
The bidding in this game was very reminicent of Vegas Showdown where players play for postion on the various city tiles and up their bid (in this case guards) to either get the other player to take the offer and move on or move on themselves.  Eventually all players will have their own city tile to act upon.  By manipulating their tax tile they can gain various resources.  The choice of tile was important but even more so was the ability to get to place goods first.  Even with few goods the first player could use other's resources to score some points.  A interesting and fun game.

A very well produced game, but there is far too much down time.  The game is heavily prone to AP, which caused the game we played to go for almost two hours--about twice as long as it should have.  There are so many options that it is overwhelming.  However, it is balanced and could be better with a faster crowd.

这个游戏共有六个回合,代表六年.在这六年里,每年玩家扮演1名征税官员去拜访六座城池中的一座，游戏就由此得名。

这个游戏的布局和我以前玩过的斯陶芬王朝还颇有几分相像，作为一款2007年Essen的新游戏，这款游戏的整体表现基本符合我们的预想，实际体验的效果非常不错。别具一格的拍卖机制，如一碗清香四溢的茶汤，慢慢地渗入玩家的舌尖，品过之后，许久还能回味到淡淡的余香。游戏流程非常流畅不拖沓，如山水大家的水墨画，一气呵成。别的不多说啦，强烈推荐！

A good example from what I am now calling the "Power Grid" school - a bunch of entirely unrelated mechanics that fit together into a generally interesting machine.

I've actually only ever played this with the expansion (Loyal Retinue).  However, I'm not convinced that the game would be significantly improved by its removal.  The biggest problem is that it seems to characterize the idea of pushing a bunch of cubes around.  This was my biggest gripe with Mykerinos as well.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not something that I really look forward to much these days. [06/28/2009]

Sok jó ötletet gyúrt össze a szerző más játékokból. A licit az Amun-Re-re emlékeztet, annyi érdekességgel, hogy átmenni egy másik helyre adott egységbe kerül, attól függően, hogy mennyire messze van a kezdőhelytől. A második fázis volt nekem az igazi újdonság és tetszetős rész. Négyfajta nyersanyagot gyűjtünk, plusz gárdistákat, akikkel a licitálást végezzük és lovakat, akikkel a 4. fázis sorrendjét döntjük el. Ezt városokban tesszük méghozzá úgy, hogy egy véletlenszerűen sorsolt hatszöget állítunk be a liciten megnyert városban. Ezen a hatszögön mindig van egy valami, illetve van 2-től 5-ig terjedő ága, amivel ennyi fajta dolgot gyűjthetünk be. Természetesen minél több ága van, annál értékesebb az adott város. A 4. fázisban eldől a megszerzett lovak száma alapján az 5. fázis sorrendje, amiben a megszerzett terményeinket adjuk el Puerto Rico módon. Kiválasztunk egy sort és azt kötelezően mindenki feltölti a rendelkezésre álló terményeivel, amiért pontot kap, illetve a sort kiválasztó vagy pontot vagy egy Taj Mahalhoz hasonló kártyát, amin 3 féle jóember lehet. Ezek a kártyák a játék végén többség szerint hoznak még pontot. Ennyi a játék. A licit rész kicsit macerás és az is a leghosszabb fázis, de van benne ötlet, a többi része a játéknak meg teljesen jól működik. Nem egy korszakalkotó társas, de nem vészesen hosszú és játszható, talán kicsit egysíkú.

RATING: 5
This is a fully functional game with some solid newer ideas.  I really love the dials and how they forced tough decisions, but the heart of the games is the bribing. There is certainly room for being clever by squeezing money from people to get your pawn around the board to where you really want to go, or to take someone's money so that you can use it against them when you bounce back from other booty accumulations.  This whole mechanic seems like it should be entertaining, but after a while it just wears on you. (Before the Wind just does this so much better and with more control and limitations). 

The market is the least fun part as there are very few decisions to be made, unless you fought for the horses, and even then most of it is just calculation.  Sometimes the formulas yield amusing results, but nothing I'd laud as fun. Something like an abstract Rube Goldberg machine, but instead of all the fun parts you just have cubes and numbers.

As a small issue, while the movement cost rule seems easy, it was constantly questioned and often gotten wrong.  There is an irritating level of friction to this that probably could have be helped with some iconography (although, the icons that they are already using were near indecipherable).  

All in all most of this feels like it takes a lot of effort to play and to keep running.  Not for fans of games with a huge level of chaos.

What a cool game!  This is definitely one of the best games that I've played lately.  It's got a great auction mechanic, plus really interesting scoring mechanisms.  It seems that you're constantly trading off what goods to get with what order you'll play the various rounds.  Lots of interesting decisions and great interaction in this one - a hidden gem!  I might move this up to a 9 upon further play.

UPDATE: Played with the full complement of players and really enjoyed it.  Moving up to a 9.

UPDATE #2: It's been a long time since I played this, and it's still really good, but have brought it back to a very deserving and solid 8.

Point-scoring euro that's about delivering goods and trading them for victory points, some of which are scored instantly while others are scored at the end. If memory serves, though it probably doesn't, there's a medieval theme. Or maybe that was a different game. It hardly matters. This isn't the sort of game that gets played twice.

A pretty cool auction mechanism where the overbidder pays the person they overbid (who then can move elsewhere with extra cash in hand). You score VP by placing cubes, completing lines of cubes, and collecting sets of card symbols (which you get by completing lines of cubes); these are hidden and score by rank at end of game. With so many options, its difficult to predict what will happen - seems a bit chaotic. Still, very neat game.

The board shows a circular road with 6 exits, each to a city. Cities show hexagons with a mixture of stuff on each side (colored cubes, guards=currency of the game, and horses=initiative). Each turn, one city is randomly out of play. The other 5 each get a random hex tile with arrows pointing to 2-5 of the 6 sides; this is placed in the hexagon on the city space. The initial part of each turn is placing your marker: first turn you may start anywhere, but after that you pay 1 guard to move to an adjacent city (can move any distance; always pay at least 1, even if not moving), then make a bid: first player bidding on a city must bid 0. If you overbid someone, they immediately either raise their bid or accept your money (guards) and move to another city and bid. Continue till everyone is alone in a city. Then, each rotates their hex tile as they like and take the stuff (cubes, guards, etc.) they are pointing to. Some hexes also reward monk cards (3 colors; a stock is in the bank). 

Next, play in horse-order (most--> least; ties broken by higher city number). On your turn, choose which of the available "orders" you'd like fulfilled. Each order consists of a combination of colored cubes. Starting with you and going clockwise, players MUST use any cubes demanded by the order, until the order is fulfilled. Each cube placement awards VP. When the order is complete, you get either VP or a monk card (depends on which order you chose).

After 6 rounds, there's final scoring of the monks: for each color, 1st-4th place get VP. The player with the most VP wins!

This is hands-down the best new, short game I've played in over the past 12 months.  Can't wait to play it again--best part is, it really is 1 hour, and is playable with our lunch group.

This game is quite underrated and is plagued with comments about distaste for playing tax collectors.  Groan, really?  That's a deciding factor? Truly bizarre.  

The game is excellent, has several interlocking mechanics, and plays in under 1 hour, even with a full compliment of players.  Basically, it rocks!

Everyone who says otherwise is simply doing it wrong!

A slightly frustrating game. Each round feels almost identical, with a bidding phase (to acquire goods) followed by a delivery phase (to convert goods to VP, directly or indirectly).

On the other hand, the delivery phase is hard to plan for, and feels chaotic with more players.

A fairly good eurogame where you collect taxes from towns and bring them to the king.

Un jeu somme toute assez simple, mais il ne se démarque pas vraiment. Je dirais oui pour le rejouer, mais pas plus que bien d'autres jeux. En résumé, un bon jeu facilement oubliable.

I really like the bidding system in this game.  It's similar to Amun-Re's leapfrog system, except it costs you to move from city to city, and the other players must pay you to outbid you.  Very clever.  Also, there are excellent and tough decisions to be made.  You have to decide if you want more stuff, or to be faster.  More stuff means that you have more to sell, but it may be worthless.  Being faster means less stuff, but it will probably be worth more.

Has interestsing meachanisms and works technically. However, it felt very repetitive because you are not building up anything - you merely repeat the same turn over and over.

Pretty interesting game after two plays.  I wouldn't recommend playing with 3 players (it wasn't terrible, but it was definitely lacking).  With 5 players, we had a really good time playing this one.

And I understand why it gets the "Amun-Re" bidding attached to it, but that's really too simple...getting outbid may mean that you pay *twice* for the same town if you choose to stay.  The bidding for towns is definitely at the heart of this game; knowing when to trade VPs for guards seems to be critical.

RATING: 7
Played twice, once each with 4 and 5 players; supports 3-5. Probably best with 5 and then with 4. Pretty much a game of soldier gathering to be able to claim the city with the most horses and/or goods. There is a bit of luck with respect to how good the cities to which you are adjacent are, but smart play can overcome it.

It was "interesting".  Abstract to the max, and confusing to teach.  Determining turn order three times per turn was lame, along with the fact that there was no real build-up as the game went along.  A MUCH lighter game then expected, that takes too long to be filler.  

And now that I read that there is NO 6-player, this game deserves to lose more points.

Simple rules that result in a superb game. Components are very nice. This game is a gem and has a lot variability on how it plays each time. There is a learning curve to figure out how to maximize your points (scoring is very simple but how to get the maximum points is rather an elegant consideration of what the other player may do and how is going first). The game becomes even better if you get the expansion.

League of Six is the exciting game of... tax accountancy? Well, yeah... even I have to admit the theme isn't really great on this one. It turns out that this is actually a fun game though.

There are six cities, some of which will be randomly shut down for the turn. Each of the open cities has a hex spot which is bordered by various colored cubes (I think the game explained what they were but for the life of me I couldn't tell you what they are), horses or escorts. And each city randomly gets a hex tile that has between two and five arrows which you can turn to point to some combination of the stuff around the city.

In turn order you move your coach to the city of your choice, paying 1 escort for every city you pass by, and place your coach in the city. If you're the first person bidding on a city you have to put your coach on the zero spot and pay another escort... if not you have to put your coach on a higher spot which is your bid to go to that city. The person already there can accept the bid and take that many escorts from you, move to another city, or outbid you... which means putting their coach on a higher spot which is a bid they're offering to you. You can always spend two victory points to get another escort, so bidding high can tank your score.

After everybody has selected a city, you take the stuff that the arrows are pointing to. Turn order is readjusted based on the count of horses. In case of a tie, every city is numbered 1 to 6 and the higher number wins ties. Then starting with the first player (from the new turn order) a delivery is selected.

There are two delivery boards, with five different possible deliveries each. Some of the deliveries only require two goods and some require six. Every delivery row shows the color of goods required and some amount of victory points that you get for filling a cube there. Next to each delivery there is a bonus that is given when it is completed. Except the bonus goes to the player who selected this delivery, not the player who completes it. Once a delivery has been selected, the start player plays all the cubes he can to it, then every player in clockwise order must then play to that delivery if they can. Once it is completed the bonus is awarded to the player who selected the delivery and the next player in turn order gets to select a new delivery to make. Once everyone has selected a delivery and/or everyone is out of cubes, both delivery boards are discarded and the next ones in the stack become active for the next round.

One of the delivery boards gives rewards in points... the other gives you a card. So the 2 delivery on one board gives you two points, but the 2 delivery on the other board gives you a card with two people symbols. Those cards show peasants, knights and monks and are used in a majority contest at game end. You add up all the peasants on your cards, then all the knights, then all the monks. The person who has the most of a type gets 9 points, next most gets 4, next most gets 2.

So a lot of the game revolves around outbidding opponents, deciding when to go to a city in hopes of getting overbid... which would then allow you to overbid someone else and when to just go to a cheap city. You're also trying to get higher in turn order so that you can start a delivery that will reward you well but force your opponents to waste cubes in a way that won't score them many points.

Despite the fact that the game is thematically challenged I found it to be a lot of fun. I ended up getting in a lot of bidding fights, which actually led me and another player to trail pretty far behind the lead players. The player who won was the one who would often take a city that didn't reward much, but that nobody would fight over. There's a fair bit to think about in the game and I look forward to figuring out how to do better at this game.

OK game, but nothing too exciting. Some clever rules, but part of them might be too clever for their own good. To be driven out of a city because of a lost bid and then returning to reclaim it is a cumbersome and clunky procedure. Best mechanic in the game is the way in which you select trade conditions for the whole group. Would play again if someone else suggested it, but certainly do not need to own it.

Only played once, but I am very unlikely to touch this one again. Distinctly soulless. I had hopes that the uniqueness of the theme would save this one, but it is exactly the same as every other trading game out there, in that it has little to no connection with trading and instead relies on nonrelated mechanics to create a game that fails to stand out at all. The final nail in the coffin is just how much it feels like I am not playing the game, but rather that it is playing me.  My decisions were mostly obvious, and extremely sensitive to timing that was out of my control. It added frustration onto what was already a mildly irritating game.

I'm a bit surprised at the lukewarm reaction this has gotten, as I thought game play was really solid and despite some familiar mechanics the experience felt quite original. I was particularly impressed by how minor changes in the board each turn (the dials, regions in play, and gem markets) made for a wholly different problem to analyze. My only concern is that to play the game competitively might require a ridiculous amount of analysis paralysis... I'll have to play again to assess this concern.

Okay game of converting goods into points.  There's a bit of a twist in the funky rules of how you can get other people to help you with scoring VPs,  so some tactical optimisation there,  and the bidding mechanic is interesting with an Amun-Re increasing bid increments, but with the paying the person you outbid.  Unfortunately,  the endgame feels a bit broken (or maybe we just didn't see it coming) - since you can only win one spot,  and your guards (money) aren't transformed into VPs,  there's no reason not to pay the maximum price the minute you can arrange it.

RATING: 8.5
I liked this one a lot.  It is definitely one of those lots of moving pieces/can't tell who's winning until it's over games.  However, it has the right amount of screwage, randomness and fun to give it a pretty good rating for me.

Even better with more plays.

RATING: 3
For me this game is soulless. Too much work and no feeling of accomplishment nor fun. Also, the components do have issues. The icons are way too small. Also, the numbers on the scoring cards don't stand out.

A rating of 3 is kind of harsh, as the game is functional and the mechanics work. But unless someone strongly requests to play this game, I won't play it.

Interesting bidding mechanism kinda like Evo. Then there is the collecting of gems/commodities and setting turn order. Then there is spending the gems/commodities. All three things work though it is a little chaotic trying to plan all 3 steps based on the bidding. Almost like 2 games put together with a turn order step in between. Hey I still like it.

RATING: 5.5
Played once (with 5 players). This game as some interesting, both old and new, ideas, and decent components. There might be too many little random elements (the same player could be unlucky enough to get a closed city or bad hex tiles several turns in a row, which definitely won't help him - for no fault of his own). Also, the way goods are converted into victory points or cards, while interesting, doesn't seem very easy to control. The main drawback, however, could be that all 6 turns are quite similar to each other, with barely any strategy going on - with very few resources stored, even with 5 players, and no way of planning something for the following turns.

RATING: 6.5
A little hard to predict best path but it may get better with more games.

Very nicely produced and people have complained about the themelessness of the game but it works for me.

This will probably not increase beyond a seven. The initial auction runs long and can get dull after a while with the back and forth of bouncing around the favored cities. It is also not very obvious how to plan you point generation. Very tactical with planning limited to the turn you are on except for collection of figures for points. I enjoy the game still.

Early impressions for the League of Six seemed to have been mostly on the negative side, so admittedly the game fell off my radar after a while.  However, a couple of more glowing reviews have popped up since then that made me reconsider by initial misgivings.

It's true that there are a lot to like in League of Six.  The Amun-Re style of bidding for cities; the random closing of location(s) each round combined with the distribution of the taxation tiles meant almost everyone will very likely have to shuffle their position each time (although the effects of it may be less felt depending on the number of players); the constant shift of turn order (which may or may not annoy you); the different ways of accumulating victory points; and last but not least the interesting mechanism of storing goods.  All of these gave one the sense that this is a very busy and varied game with no sense of downtime.  Some have commented that you literally play the same way throughout all 6 rounds, I myself did not feel like that in my first game, I was pretty much engrossed with how to best use with what I have to be finding myself performing the same mundane tasks.

However, is the sum of all that greater than its individual parts?  This I am far less uncertain.  One of the players said at the end that the game seem to reward the rich as they get richer, and seeing how he had lagged behind the entire time, I will have to agree.  There is also the problem with the fact that if someone had been able to accumulate a lot of guard cards in the beginning, it becomes fairly impossible (at least not without a huge cost) to outmanuver him to get a decent city you can tax with as the game goes on.  This is even more significant if the tiles come out in such a way that there is only one lucrative spot round after round, and suffice to say he won with a fairly large margin (I'd say at least a 20 point difference between first and last place).

League of Six is a beautiful game, and definitely an interesting one.  I'm just not sure if the entire package is good enough to warrant more than the occasional play.

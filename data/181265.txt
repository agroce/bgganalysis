Really happy I got this one.  With four difficulty levels, solo mode and up to 6 players, there's a lot of game in the box.  The bright artwork looks great on the table and the ant minis are fun.  Plays really well with our kids (8 & 10 years old).  The level of player vs player aggression is perfect for our family - enough so it's not multi-player solitaire but not so much that you're in each others' faces.

I’m very pleased with BrilliAnts. There is a ton of game in the box and the sheer number of components is worth the money. If I had any complaints, it would be that it takes a bit much to setup everything, even for a 1 or 2 player game. However, if you’ve got the time to set everything up, it’s definitely a game that will catch the interest of your gaming group.

Un jeu qui séduit tant par son esthétique relevée que sa mécanique fluide adaptative (au niveau de complexité des règlements). Une partie de plaisir à coup sûr!
Un jeu Fourmidable quoi!

Game with a lot of material that is of good quality. There are several versions of rules, but the one I prefer is the one with the common goals.

RATING: 5
Not bad, but still a kid's game at heart, even with the so-called "advanced" rules. It looks great, and is actually kind of fun to play, even though the cards and player powers range from "very good" to "practically useless," meaning there is a lot more luck here than it looks. The additional "take that" mechanic does not improve the game, and only adds an additional level of randomness, as players cannot see the other players' hands.

Really fun and easy to learn game, it's colorful, there are some interesting choices to make, the different difficulty levels make it perfect to play with your kids and you can still go for the expert mode to play with seasoned players, a really good game. The rulebook could be clearer with more examples and pictures.

Really great components, especially the ant miniatures that has a dial that switches from daytime to nighttime.  Play feels a bit similar-ish to Takenoko, in that you have cards in hand that give you an objective to complete in order to gain points.  Biggest difference is that this game is definitely more aggressive in that you gobble up board space collecting bugs, fruits, and dirt.  The preditors (grasshopper, spider, and milipede) also introduces a bit of a "take-that" into the game - though as an opponent you're totally guessing as to what the other person is trying to collect.

J'ai testé le prototype de ce jeu et je dois avouer avoir eu beaucoup de plaisir avec ce-dernier! Un jeu avec un thème intéressant, des mécaniques originales et qui se joue très bien à 2 comme à 4 joueurs, et même en solo! En famille, avec vos enfants, entre amis ou en couple, ce jeu plaira à tous.

It even has rules for different style of gamers from a friendly family game to a cutthroat game.
I watched a couple reviews and even saw Playingboardgames at Twitch.com play it live.
Some mechanics look complex and theming is flowing everywere which is something I like.
Can't wait to play this game with all the new stretch-goals it achieved.

This game is awesome. I was part of the Kickstarter and the final game just got turn out to be magnificently cool. Lots of detail in the gameplay and pieces. The rules are really well balanced and the different rule sets are mostly useful to understand the game step by step or to play with special co-players (like younger children). This will become a classic that everyone should own.

Oh what a great game for anyone! I'm amazed to see so much levels of play: you can try it with young kids (really easy and fast version), intermediate level (not-so complex, perfect for family), with strategic gamers who loves worker-placement mechanic (expert version with lot of cards) and even solo (in a different twist with the predators)! The concept, the components (ants figures are great) and the gameplay are fantastic. Recommended!

Matériel de très bonne qualité, plateaux de jeu individuels bien pensés, tout est beau et agréable à regarder/manipuler. La façon dont les actions se déroulent permet de faire des choix tactiques dès le niveau "apprentis" du jeu. J'apprécie qu'il y ait aussi le niveau pour enfants pour jouer avec les plus petits. Je m'attend à une bonne rejouabilité étant donné que les objectifs, les pouvoirs et les cartes spéciales changent d'une partie à l'autre. L'expérience de fin de partie est vraiment intense lorsque les ressources se font rares, que les phéromones bloquent les passages et que les prédateurs viennent foutre le bordel Au plaisir de rejouer!

BRILLIANT game, played with my 9 years old daughter at easiest levels and we enjoyed it very much. Can be much more complex at higher levels for adults and experimented players. The quality of the components is amazing ! The design and artwork is beautiful and the miniature ants are very fun to play with.
I highly recommend it !

I played this game yesterday evening at La Revanche with my niece (11) and nefew (9), and we had so much fun!! Thanks a lot foe this opportunity Maxime, Simon and Simon!

Nice gameplay, easy to learn, adaptable to all ages. Don't get fool by the "kiddy" look from the nice graphics, you will have fun for sure!

The kids wanted to have the game before we played it; now they ordered me to buy it, because : "we only played one game and it's not enough!" And "we have to play all the versions of the game".

I have to admit it, I can't wait to get my own copy in my hands!

Go for it, you really won't be desapointed!!

Really cool game. Turns go by quickly, the action ramps up as you introduce an extra worker per turn, cards feel interesting and dictate some of your plans, being efficient is a really captivating puzzle and a race at the same time. The fact that there are like 4 rules make this easy to explain even as a gateway. I like this game :)

I wanted to love this game!   I'm an ant fanatic. Really neat idea, I like the territory control and the nest/surface interaction. It's a great way to really simulate the feel of any colonies vying for control and getting tangled up.

A downfall is the day/night mechanic which constantly gets overlooked and adds unnecessary complexity. Just lay a worker down after it has acted and drop the whole day/night cycle.

The weather spinner is pointless and also easily forgotten.

Also didn't like the extra faction and single-use powers added in the upper levels of play.  Didn't really make anything more fun, just complicated.

It´s a good family game, it shines in the expert mode, the component's are excelent, the mechanics are very good, the interaction is good but I think it as a problem in the random objectives, that can make the game too long for what it is, so, depending on the number of players, we deal randomly 2 or 3 cards from each different tipe of objective, and the problem was solved.

Went in at the last hours, because I think a lightish game like this could be nice for our weekly game nights, especially one that goes up to 6 players (don't have too many of those). I see it more as an adaptable gateway game than a true gamers game, but it could be a stepping stone for others. Main reason for going in was thinking about how well Waggledance goes over in our group, so lightish fare goes well here.

We enjoyed the game much more than we expected. The day/night tracking system wasn’t something we’ve encountered before. It was an easy game, lighter I think than Lords of Waterdeep—but not as straight-forward.

The game gets even higher marks because the component and production quality was phenomenal. The rules were a little difficult to digest though.

Very nice game in very good quality and a LOT of material. Cute graphics and minis with a very interesting and simpel Day/Night mechanism. You can choose a difficulty level for everybody and from 'everyone nearly play for themselves' to a very complex, tactical and competetive game variant. And there are no monsters, aliens, orcs, dragons, heros or zombies...

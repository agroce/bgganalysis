GAME: Clash for a Continent:  Battles of the American Revolution and French & Indian War
RANK: 3626

RATING: 6.5
Feels weird with AP type of control. Maybe played too much CnC:A in the first place. Amazingly, the system works to a certain extend that really creates a very intense and exciting moments in the battle.

Overall a gamey feel to it but has great potential, perhaps with more gaming time on it.

Very similar system to the Command & Colors game series but not quite as well executed. The terrain tiles are pretty thin and they don't stay on the map very well. The unit tiles are also poorly designed. They were originally supposed to be wooden blocks but a last minute change turned them into tiles. Unfortunately you have to turn and flip them all the time and keeping track of where each tile is supposed to be is a pain.

RATING: 7.5
Good quick fun.  Lots of crises for both sides.  Limited options each turn make for tense play.  Only disappointments: split (two-piece) map and thin terrain tiles (single-sided, though, so can be mounted on heavy stock or wood).  Worthwhile.

The obvious successor to C&C for Black powder era battles in light wargames. I really feel like this game is being overlooked. That's fine for me, since I feel like I'm sitting on a hidden gem mine, but Worthington games deserves a huge amount of recognition for this system. I used to pine for an updated version of BC or a C&C Napoleonic game, but now I am only interested in the next version of this system for any powder era games. This game has moved up to the same place among my games as C&C:A because it does what I felt C&C:A did for the era it portrays: Plays realistically but also quickly. This system is REALLY, REALLY good.

This game has really grown on me, especially since I started using minis and 3d terrain. The pace is slow, but this perfectly captures the often stately and sometimes even glacial pace of battles in this era. Patience and time spent maneuvering troops into advantageous positions pays off while any sort of headlong rush is more often than not disastrous.

RATING: 6
A '6' under the standard rules. With the advanced optional rules, goes to 7. Easy-to-learn and play. Components are well-done, though some may find the reading and positioning of the counters a bit fiddly. For the gamer that enjoys tweaking and fine-tuning their wargames, the game is robust enough to handle and reward your efforts. 15 scenarios cover the battles of the French & Indian and American Revolutionary Wars. 

This game receives a components upgrade, thematic embellishments, and 18 new scenarios in Worthington's followup game/expansion set called Hold the Line.

Rare combination of playability and historical feel. More fun w/15mm miniatures. Low attrition means it favors patient positioning. Poor base map is only drawback. See my 2 page rule summary and EZ setup maps that make it quick to setup certain scenarios.
Amazingly well playtested scenarios, simple enough rules to use all the applicable advanced rules. Diametrically opposite to C&C system (Memoir) 'cuz of turn limit, APs on ANY front, move THEN fire (not move AND fire). Requires patient manuevring.

RATING: 5
Underwhelmed. It's just a Memoir '44 knock-off, and while some of the stuff in there is interesting, the game as a whole is kinda pedestrian. Without the cards to vary things and provide special actions, the game lacks excitement; it has many of the same flaws as Memoir '44 (insanely luck-heavy, highly questionable scenario balance) without the upside of nice bits and some suspense.

I was somewhat annoyed with Worthington, because I when I signed up to get this I thought it was going to be a classic block game more along the lines of Victoria Cross, of which I am fond. But it seems like they changed the whole concept late in production to be basically just a ripoff of a popular game. Still looking forward to Alamo, but other than that, Worthington Games has now gone off my "watch" list.

A bit light for my taste, about the equivalent of Memoir 44 in complexity.  I like the action point mechanic quite a bit (better than Memoir's cards) and I like how fast turns move.  I also like that units move or fire, so closing to attacking is risky.  

If you are in the mood for a ligher C&C:A with a Revolutionary theme, this won't disappoint.

This is the type of game for me in my old age.  It also filled a nice hole in my game collection.  I'm not familiar with the C&C:A that many mention, but I am with M'44.  Games are very similar but I like the Command Point activation much better than the cards.  This is a solid game and I'm glad I purchased it.

RATING: 7
This game appears similar to the Commands & Colors system, but it is actually quite different.  I enjoy both.  This seems to me a slight step up from that system (though they both have different parts that are more advanced than the other), but this one feels just a bit tougher to grasp how to get your guys to do want you want them to do in the time allotted.  

There is a lot of flexibility to commanding your men, however, you never have enough time/orders to give to do everything you want.  

Great scenarios, beautiful components (though Hold the Line is definitely as step up, I do like the wood blocks) make this a favorite that I hope to get many more plays from!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Very similar to the Commands & Colors system, but instead of using cards to order units, you roll for action points that can be spent to move and fire whichever units you like.  This was a bad idea.  At this scale, there's not really any room for tactical decision-making.  Just move your strong guys to the front and your weak guys to the back, and hope you roll hits faster than your opponent does.

The only real similarity to Columbia block games is the fact that you rotate the counters to record hits.  There's no fog of war.  (I suppose the fact that the counters are made of wood is technically a similarity, but that has zero to do with the gameplay.)

Good skirmish game, movement is more difficult and having good ground is more important than in Memoir 44 or similiar C&C games.  Different enough to justify playing and owning both series....good stuff.

This is a solid game. The mechs are intuitive for a C&C player but there is enough different here that you def know you are playing a different system. The action points and move/shoot rules hit on the black powder theme nicely. The best of many cool aspects of this game is the era and scenarios. I'm glad someone had the good sense to bring quick play to the era and region.

Pre-cursor to Hold The Line and block-game-that-wasn't-really-a-block-game mechanics.

RATING: 7.5
Overall, a nice light tactical battle game in the same vein as Battle Cry.  Complexity-wise this is more complex than Battle Cry, but about the same as Command and Colors: Ancients.  (assuming none of Clash's optional chrome rules are added).  The optionals add even more historical flavor at the cost of simplicity.  I don't add them when playing my wife, but they add to my level of enjoyment in solo games.

The command cards of the C & C system are gone and have been replaced with a variable activation point system which works well enough.  The card management aspect is missed, but the point system makes this game much more solo friendly than C & C Ancients.  Clash uses a single wooden counter for each unit.  Unit strength is tracked by rotating and flipping over the counter. The wooden counters are nice, of high quality, and are less fiddly than having multiple plastic units in a hex used for hit points.  The board and terrain tiles probably won't impress those used to only playing Eurogames or Memoir '44, but they are more than adequate and function well.  I had a good time playing this game and would gladly play again.

Very light wargame which reminds me of the Commands & Colors system except without cards. The scenarios are very quick and most can be played in under an hour.  My only complaint, and it's minor, is the thickness of the terrain tiles, they're very thin. I usually use plexiglass to keep it from moving around.

Really enjoyed the games of it I've played, expect to put it on the table again in the near future.  Does a great job of providing a fast-playing game with strong period feel.  Attacker has the harder tactical task in most scenarios as it can prove difficult to approach the enemy without being chewed up by their fire. (unlike Battle Cry, most units cannot move & fire)

Also very impressed with the balance and testing of the scenarios.  We've had very few runaway wins but ordinarily both players have been in it until the end.  In the 1 or 2 cases where a blow out has occured, an alternate strategy proved to tighten the odds dramatically.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I must admit that this is a really good game. I like it better than the Command and Colors series in no small part because you DONT draw cards. The activation points plus a die roll give some randomness, but still you can attack on your left, and then attack on your left, and tehn attack on your left, etc.

The battles are short and quick to set up. 

I think the only thing I would change in this game is to allow formation moves and fires...that if units are touching they could move or fire together...to reward keeping linear tactics going. I would probably also allow the various indians even a little more freedom, but overall this game is solid, I have played most of the scenarios and enjoyed them a lot.

Final note - my game came with two blocks short. Fortunately for me the folks at Worthington Games have great customer service, and sent me replacements. I appreciate that - and will thus keep buying their games. This is a good, solid company!

RATING: 7
Quasi Commands and Colors system but using a D3 to determine the number of activated units.  While not giving as much color as the cards, it does allow you to play solo.  Battle dice simply gives losses, not any retreats.

Units can either move *or* attack, which I think is a better implementation of black powder combat than found in Battle Cry.

Half way through the scenarios and loving the game.  All have been unique and have come down to the last, or next to last turn, so balance has been very good.  I nice easy to learn, and easy to play game.

Light wargame, similar to Battle Cry and Memoir '44. More solitaire friendly because the system uses random activation points, instead of cards, to limit options each turn.  Fast playing and fun.

RATING: 8
Interesting variation on the Command and Colors system that gives more of a traditional wargame feel.  My original fear that this might be too close to the C&C games to be worth owning was off base.  This is another light battle game but the rules differences are sufficient to justify owning it as well.

Scenarios Played: Fort Duquesne, Bunker Hill, Lake George

RATING: 10
Great wargame. I enjoy games that are a bit easier,...not chalked full of troops etc. This game uses the Block system to a degree although there is not "fog of war" unless you can stand these thin pieces on end. I am not too sure I am for Fog of War with this game for there are not that many pieces we are talking about and think it wouldnt be worth it.

The game is unusual.....the mapboard comes with extras to change the scene etc. The movement makes sense, I like the emphasis on moral and feel that makes for realistic battle. In addition, the game uses commanders, has artillery fire that allows for fire ahead of the troops which again is realistic. Some of the Revolutionary War games are simply too complicated while this ones allows you to fight certain battles without getting bogged down in the overall war. 

This game is simply one of the best...one has to get the hang of Protecting their troops once the morale factor gets to 1. If not, you will surely lose in victory points.

It does to 18th century warfare what I wish Command and Colors had done to ancient warfare. It is a simple and fast game that has enough depth to make me wish to play again. Components could have been better.

RATING: 8
The game is easy and fast. It captures the feeling of advancing under enemy fire and close combat or fire. It's hard to understand that you can either move or fire (cannot do both at same time!)... but so it was in that period of time.
Pity that the materals are a bit poor, otherwiese my rating would have been higher. Hopefully the new games of Worthington will have better quality components.
However, it's fun and faaaaaaaaaast: in less than 3 hours I could explain the rules to my friend and play 5 scenarios!!!

I really love the "wooden counters", it would be great to see some other wargames deluxified with big fat wooden counters, but the game really didnt grab me. I didnt get any sense of battles it was trying to represent and I didnt feel i really had any options beyond move forward and attack.

RATING: 6
Played Camden ftf and Bunker Hill solo. There is a lot to like here. The game is fun and tense most of the time. You´d think that a game at this scale would seem strange without any facing rules (without any optional rules), but it works. 

My one big problem with the game is the activation system. These systems are all the rage these days, but sometimes their effects are strange. Imagine the Brits attacking the American line at Bunker Hill. The attackers can´t move forward with more than a small part of their line. If they achieve a breakthrough, their commander face a strange choice. Either you bring up reinforcements and in the meantime your troops in the gap will do nothing. They won´t even return fire. Or, you let your Stosstruppen fight til they die, and then the reserves will be too far behind to ever catch up.

In short, I think the troops should be able to deliver some fire without the use of Action Points. But then again, that would be a different and more complicated system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Certainly similar to the C&C series, but giving more flexibility in choosing units to activate. This can mean that all the action is focused on one area/group of units, and others never do anything. In this way I think C&C does a better job of balancing, well, Command & Control. Overall, good game, though.

10/17/15 Today I played the first four scenarios, twice each. I didn't play Clash for a Continent per se, as I used the board, terrain, and counters from Hold the Line, its successor. I think I can rate the game even though I didn't technically play using only the CfaC components. Though I have seen them. Basically the two games are pretty much the same thing, as the rules, terrain and counter mix are 99.5% the same. The only real difference is HtL upgraded the quality of the components (especially the counters). That's why I rate it a 7, but CfaC only a 6.

RATING: 8
The game offers five scenarios for the French-Indian War and 10 scenarios for the American Revolutionary War--from Bunker Hill, to Brandywine, and ultimately, Yorktown. 

Although the two-piece board and the tiles come on relatively thin coated card stock, the wooden unit counters are sturdy, and, with stickers applied, are attractive and easily recognizable. Set-up takes quite a while--in particular, counting out and laying down the necessary terrain tiles. 

Also, the 8-page, black-and-white rulebook is well written and well illustrated. (Too bad that prior to printing someone didn't point out how dark the game box cover illustration is.) A really nice system, particularly with the random roll that adds onto basic "action" points at the beginning of a turn (which generally provides 2-5 actions per turn, per side). 

The scenarios are obviously well thought-out and play-tested, as I find that I quickly get a feel for the style of battle and the capabilities of both sides. I find I like to play each scenario 2-3 times, while I have the same one set up on the board. 

It's very easy to learn and understand the game, and, with 15 scenarios and some more on BGG, replayability seems very high, as games can play out in distinctly different ways. Every scenario I've played so far I've had the urge to replay, knowing that I'd do the second or third ones differently--even more so than with similar games I also play, like "Commands & Colors--Ancients."  

What I really like about this game is that it's fairly simple to learn and play, yet feels like a complete simulation experience. 

Got in trade, September 2007. 

Postscript: Initially, doing the set-ups took about a half-hour, but with experience I find I can usually set up in about 15 minutes. Realize that although, like "Memoir '44," there are individual tiles to be set up, the tiles in this game are on thin, coated card stock, so it's more difficult to keep them in place. Although I wish the card stock had at least been thicker, that's not a negative criticism of Worthington Games: not everybody can afford to produce the kinds of components Days of Wonder does, for example. The only limitations of this game for me are its relative simplicity and the fact that you can only play isolated battles rather than an entire campaign at once.

RATING: 9
A very fun wargame. I have only played the Bunker Hill scenario ... so my rating may change after I get the chance to play some more of the other scenarios. IMHO ... this game does have some similar elements to M44 and others of the type, but it has so many other elements different, I do not feel the comparison is very fair. The price does seem a tad high for the number of bits, but I think the quality is above average, and they all seem to work together very well. The action point system makes for some hard choices and ... you are not "stuck" with a hand full of cards for "units on the right" when you can't do anything on the right. (This last comment is for those who feel this is a M44 or BC knock off. Which it is not). I think the leaders could be made for effective if they could "activate" adjacent units ... a house rule twist I plan on playing around with when I get the chance. Bottom line ... worth the $$$ ... More later ...

EXCELLENT, UNDER APPRECIATED, LIGHT WAR GAME
I bought this one because (1) of my interest in the American Revolutionary period, (2) some positive BGG reviews, and (3) I'm always on the lookout for simple war games to play with my son.  I am very pleased with this acquisition.  The play is simple but engaging.  The action point limitation and fixed (i.e., barely enough if you are the attacker) number of game turns provide plenty of tension.  An excellent game to play with wargamers in training.  A lot of comparisons are made to Memoir 44 which I think may be justified based on appearance, but the play and feel is completely different. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a simple wargame.

RATING: 6
I'm enjoying this one solo, but still not quite sure yet what I think about it and if I want to pick up a copy of one of the Hold the Line games, which I had planning to buy.  The component quality is not very good - the wooden units are pretty good, but the map and hexes are bad.  But I know this has been fixed by Hold the Line.  I wish there was a turn marker sized for the turn track, with French/British flags on opposite sides, to keep better track of whose turn it is.  

Gameplay is good, but I still keep thinking I prefer M44 for several reasons: 
1. It's much easier to visually see unit strength with minis.
2. The lack of cards limits replayability (you can try different strategies for each scenario but you aren't forced to by cards - the die for AP just determines how quickly or slowly you put your plan into action, not what plan you will enact).
3. I much prefer the picture-based dice of M44 - it's just faster and more fun than having to keep determining what #'s count as a hit (4-6, 5-6, or 6).
4. Retreating is a separate effect from the attack and usually beneficial for the defender, which seems screwy.  As the defender, you almost always want to retreat, so you don't take any hits, and as the attacker you don't want them to retreat, so that you can roll and do on average 1.5 damage.
5. Not being able to move and attack makes just a much slower game, even if it's more realistic for the time period.

For the last 2 points, this issue is probably because I am still using M44 tactics rather than figuring out how best to use Move or Fire tactics.  I'm finding I really rely on the Indian units that seem just so much stronger than Infantry in 4 ways (Move and Fire; Move 2 spaces; Don't have to stop in forest; more likely to retreat than most Infantry and avoid taking close combat losses).

I have played 6 games, 2 solo and 4 face to face, and feel I can rate this now.
 It is a fun, light wargame with decisions to make and tactics to follow. It sets up and plays very fast (3 games in under 3 hours). It can compare to Battle Cry for fun and time to play. Set up is much quicker and I felt I had more control. Bad die rolls will still ruin your day.

My first play positive thoughts:
* Fun system that is pretty similar to Battle Cry, Memoir, etc.
* It will be fun to play and experience the battles of this era.
* The set-up and play time will be pretty quick in all subsequent games.
* The artwork on the blocks is well done.

First glance criticisms:
* Map and terrain are pretty thin, but certainly playable.
* The blocks seemed too thin at first, but since they aren't meant to stand on edge, they work fine.

I look forward to more plays and more experience with this game. Most recent play 7-2-06 with Garrett.

Quick playing light wargame: there have been comparisons with M'44 but the important difference is the command point system. Instead of cards, each side has a fixed points system and rolls extra points (ranges between 1-3). Units either move or fire at the cost of 1 CP. Combat features Risk style to-hit system layered with M'44 range rules. Units take step losses and there are a host of other rules relating to terrain, units, leaders and more. Scenarios seem to be fairly balanced and quite historical...probably moreso than M'44.

Components are a letdown. The blocks are a little on the small side, the 2-part map shifts around annoyingly and the terrain tiles are very thin. Still, a playable game in the vein of Command and Colours...but I know which one I'd rather play. This one just lacks that magic...

It's a simple game.  It's probably the type of war game that a Euro gamer might be willing to play.  The game system is somewhat similar to Richard Borg's Command and Colors series.

The game system is somewhat similar to Richard Borg's Command and Colors series, but the player determines the number of turn moves by rolling a die instead of playing a card, and the three-column Command and Color system restriction is eliminated.

Clash for a Continent does indeed have a number similarities with the Command and Colors system. It includes a number of battles - and in this case from two different wars yet - which may cause me to have to come back here and rate it higher once I've gotten to experience them all. It uses a generic mapboard where terrain hexes are used to build the historic battlefields. But from that point it diverges into more of an actual wargame. It should also be easy to use other games' parts with it such as some have mentioned terrain hexes from other games, and those rdoxx couter holders.

A good (if simple) game of gunpowder-era battles.  The blocks are good, the cardboard mapboards are functional, but the VERY thin terrain tiles mar this otherwise fun game.  with better tiles this could be a "10" but the annoyance of constantly having to reseat the board detracts slightly from the fun.

Good, simple wargame with lots of diverse scenarios. This feels a bit like the Commands & Colors series, but with the key difference that it restricts you only in the number of commands you issue. The ability to issue a particular command to a particular unit is at your discretion, rather than limited to the cards you hold as in C&C games.

Simple, beautiful system with plenty of replay value.  Hold the Line is even better.  Plays very quickly.

This is a great game!  Full review coming soon...just gotta pull away from the board long enough to w.r..i....t...be right back.

Seriously I rank this as highly as I do Commands and Colors:Ancients.  It is of a similar complexity and same board size, but plays completely differently being based on a variable action-point system.  The games are very tense as you try and get everything done in the all-too-limited time.  

Compared with the C&C system, the scenarios seem much more varied without adding any complexity--an admirable achievement.  I would have a hard time if I had to choose between C&C:A and Clash for a Continent, although if I could truly only have one, I would probably choose C&C:A due only to its slightly better component quality and wider player base, but definitely NOT because it is the superior game!

And now, a couple years later, I would definitely choose C&C:A over this, but only due to the plethora of scenarios which are now available for C&C:A

I enjoy the game and the range of scenarios, and the system makes playing solitaire simple and fun in addition to good play with an opponent.  But the game also seems a bit bland and too dangerous for an attacking force.

Ooooooook. The Hold the Line set is without a doubt the way to go to play this, now.

That said, this was a straight-forward but fun little game. This will mostly find play with very light gamers or children. That's not a derogatory statement. Some of the best gaming partners are gaming children!

This barely made a "6", as I just can't help but compare it to the much, much more superior Memoir '44.  Still, it's a decent game, and the mechanics will draw in some - expecially tied to this time period.  See my review for more details...

Disappointed that it didn't remain a true block game but still a good game spawned from Battle Cry.  The point allocation for activation/movement sets this one apart from the crowd.

Players are straitjacketed by the system, and not for their own good.  You move a unit or two, shoot a bit, and then let your opponent do the same.  There's very little sense of grand strategy, maneuver, progress, or satisfaction.

Also, the entire game feels 100% reactive.  Player are often taking potshots at nearby units because they happen to be targetable, rallying a unit because it's about to be killed, firing with a unit one last time before it gets ambushed, or moving an about-to-be-blasted unit out of the way.

I am by no means a game snob, but this game is so light that it technically doesn't exist.

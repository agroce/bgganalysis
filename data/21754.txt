Interesting card game that flows very well. It is possibloe that the rating might imporve with more plays. 

Cards have two options - play the action or retain the card in order to collect sets. Sets are scored in threes or  against specific targets, such as two of type A,B and C for points. A neat device is the movement of the Sherrif of Nottingham who moves each time a set is scored and when he reaches the end of his track, the game ends (one of two ways to do so). On each track of his path is a number, which is indicates whether you can get an extra card by having this number of cards or fewer in your hand. It is intersteing as it can help you gain cards at good times and you need to consider this when you are scoring hands. Enjoyable game.

An odd set collection game.  Plenty of player interaction.  Somewhat weird in its implementation.  I didn't feel like the theme connected strongly with the gameplay, though there is a connection.  Plays quick.  I guess I would play this again.

Making merry in Sherwood Forest? Not really. The theme is minimal in this set collecting card game, but it is what you make it. We always seem to have fun robbing from the rich and giving to ourselves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The only interesting decision in this game is whether to concentrate on sets of three or to spend longer building up larger sets to score the bonuses.  The actual game play is pretty mindless; draw a card, if it fits with the sets you are collecting, keep it, if it doesn't, implement the card's action and hope to get something better.  Repeat for far too long.

Απλό καρτοπαίχνιδο όπου μαζεύεις σετάκια από σύμβολα για να σκοράρεις πόντους. Κάθε κάρτα σύμβολο έχει και ένα ability. Στην γύρα σου τραβάς μια κάρτα από την τράπουλα και είτε την κρατάς σαν σύμβολο είτε την χρησιμοποιείς επιτόπου για την ικανότητα. Με αυτό τον τρόπο πχ γίνονται ανταλλαγές καρτών, ή παίρνεις τυχαία κάρτα από κάποιον αντίπαλο και άλλα παρόμοια σκηνικά.

Λογικά παίζει καλύτερα με 5+ άτομα λόγω των ανταλλαγών. Βέβαια με τις τυχαίες κλοπές καταντά αρκετά χαοτικό. Το artwork είναι αδιάφορο, όπως και το θέμα του.

Γενικά πολύ μανούρα και πάρε δώσε για το τίποτα. Υπάρχουν καλύτερα καρτοπαίχνιδα εκεί έξω.

RATING: 7
Enjoyed this one quite a bit, more than expected.  We were amused with the idea of "stealing" and such always resulting in giving something to the target, and didn't like the similar iconography on a couple of the items.  It was pretty understandable overall, though, and I was particularly surprised with how well it worked with 3.  With a player range of 3-7 I expected it to be only decent with 4-5 as some others are.  Thematically wonky because you're playing the bad guys and your bad actions are technically forced trades (which I actually like game-wise), but I still like the feel of it.  Set collection with bonuses at its core.

I don't really know what to say about this.
It involves some thinking ahead, but opponents could make those plans useless. With non-new players it shouldn't take much more than 30 minutes but will be longer in a first game.
The ambush cards aren't distinct enough for my preference, Blue/Purple and White/Grey look too similar unless you get both of the pair at once.

RATING: 6
Easy to learn card game but not so fun at all.  We played a 7 players game at "La Journée Ludique de Québec 2006", it takes too much time to play. 

The graphics are not really attractive. There's no atmosphere during the game, just making pairs, trying to get enough cards to complete a mission or block a player during his turn phase.

I like the idea of turning the card from the draw pile and decide if you keep the card in your hands for further use or play the card immediately and use it to look in another player's hand (for example).

May be this game should be better with 4 to 5 players (maximum).

RATING: 7
A card game that plays up to 7 that doesn't take long at all.  It's set collection with a lot of interaction but it's not as chaotic as you would think.  Once you quickly figure out what the pictures mean on the cards, the game really flies.  I enjoy card games and this is a good one, especially when you have seven.

Update: Played with four and it worked well at that number too.  Need to remember this one.

A great little "Take That" game.  Backstabbing is so commonplace that you end up gleefully anticipating an opportunity.  I was a bit apprehensive to try this with my daughter, she doesn't like direct conflict games, but after a couple of rounds she was dishing out as good as she got.

RATING: 5
Set collection card game with a bit of a race element (since you get more points for being first to fill the orders).  It's nice that it holds up to 7, but with 7 you need to play fast or get annoyed by downtime.  Ouch, it hurts when other players fill an order directly before you... you can get stuck with a set that is near-worthless.

Is there much point in using the actions on the cards?  Maybe.  Seemed to me that the better play was typically to go for the set collection.  And why the point decrease with the second player?  Odd mechanic.  Didn't really excite me.  At least it accomodates seven players.

No sign here that Agricola/Le Harve would be pretty much the next designs Uwe would produce - this is very random, with a subdued 'take that' element, but still pleasant and enjoyable, though a bit on the long side for a filler.  Unexpected, but distant, echoes of Bohnanza in the scoring - in that you're collecting sets of cards and cashing them in and keeping ome to score - but the rest of the game is very different.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not bad, kind of thematic, but also just a bit on the dull side. Draw a card, do what it says, then the next guy goes ... some interesting decisions along the way about what goals to go for, but overall, it's a fairly pedestrian light card game. I kind of enjoyed it, wouldn't object if folks wanted to play again, but wouldn't personally request it either.

I bought this game for my Father in Law to be - It is a nice little card game that has minimal thinking in as you collect sets of three items to trade in for points or larger sets to complete missions for higher points. Be ambushed, stolen from held up amd get a few favours from the sheriff along the way in this neat little card game that works nicely as a quick filler for up to 7 people. 18 Plays.

One play.  Not surprisingly, some similar mechanisms to Bohnanza with a little bit of rummy.  Draw a card publicly, then decide to either keep the card in your hand or activate the ability that the card provides ... usually swapping the current card out with one from an opponent through trade or robbery.  The theme is completely meaningless (I joked during the game 'oh yeah, now I feel exactly like Robin Hood!) but I thought it was good fun.  I think I enjoyed it more than my opponents.

I liked this game very much the first time I played it (with 7) and rated it 7.5 but last night we played with 4 and it was awful.  There was no motivation to take single victory points so the sherriff never moved at all - we spent about 20 minutes just working on completing assignments, but only one person did.   We decided to call the game because we just weren't having enough fun to keep going.

I think this game works with the max # of players because there is so much competition for the assignments, and so people will take single VPs when they can, but not with fewer where folks will just try for assignments and let the game go on and on

This is not a great game in regards to depth, but it is very pleasant and enjoyable to play.  I think it would be a great family game because anyone has a decent chance at winning.  At the same time, because it seems to lack depth in spite of the abundance of rules (you need to learn what all 7 cards do), I doubt this game will ever become a family staple.  As long as people play quickly and don't take the game too serious, I'll always be up for playing a game.

Just a tad too long to qualify as filler.  You're basically collecting sets (various types) of numbers. However, most of this collecting is luck based on what card you draw and what cards get stolen from your hand.  So just know going in that the random factor is pretty high on this one.  But it is fun once in awhile.

A set collecting game with limited moves and conflict cards that are so defanged as to be useless. Played with 5 players and it went on WAY to long.

A light game that is basically a very elaborate rummy variant. The different card abilities make the game very wild and it will tend towards chaos if played with many players. But it has the advantage of being a game that easily fits 7 players and never has any downtime at all players will constantly be involved in either drawing cards (on their turn and also during other players turns), offering cards for trade or interact through ambushes. This makes it a good filler game, but don't expect it to be a deeply strategic game. It's best played fast, among a group of like minded "scoundrels".

Great "rummy type" card game, with a nice mix of memorizing opponents draw, and I love the added abilities linked to each card.

A Uwe Rosenberg game--also designed Le Havre, Gates of Loyang, Merkator, Bohnanza.  I am a fan.

This is a very different game with little control. This set collection card game has a lot of interrupt cards for lots of get-your-opponent actions, which I usually enjoy. Also has some special bonus cards.  It's appropriate as a filler game.  (Perhaps the scoring is a little reminiscent of Bohnanza--keep one of a set for scoring.)

The graphics are atrocious although I suppose it is supposed to be similar to woodcut art of that period.   Cards drawn can be used two ways but I wish the symbols were more descriptive--I thought some of them too similar.  The theme is loose, but that is minor.

Not a lot of depth.  I enjoyed the game at first, but dragged near the end.  It plays 7 people, so will probably play again, but nothing outstanding.  I like Bohnanza better & it also plays 7.

Got to try out a Rosenberg game that I had never heard of. When it was taught, it sounded like a pretty neat twist on regular card play mechanics. By the end, however, I wasn't entirely thrilled by this game. Not the games fault however. I just don't like games with too much chaos and luck when it comes to the card pulls and how other players can change up your hand quite a bit before the turn comes back again. But this is a game that is supposed to be somewhat random and chaotic. For a game of that nature, I would play this 100 times over any Fluxx game. So I think Rosenberg has created a relatively solid game for this type. Just not my thing.

Received from BGG Secret Santa, December 2008

May 2009 -- We've played this twice and have enjoyed it both times. I believe we will play it several times a year.

October 2011 -- After several more plays, we became familiar with the somewhat cryptic card designs, and began to really enjoy this game. We play it fairly often now.

2013-November:  This game has caught on with the family, and we have a fun time with it.

RATING: 5
Once again I realize that Uwe Rosenberg is the master of using the cards in such a way that it's unique as well as completely counterintuitive for me.

The game is interesting and if it wasn't for this counterintuitivness I would have a good time. In this case each move I just struggled to get a grasp of the possibilities the game offers. Every turn from the top.

I won't play it but I appreciate the design.

RATING: 6
Light card game, collect sets while constantly swapping single cards back and forth.  Takes 3-7 so good for a starter, and there is a little more to the gameplay strategy-wise than simple rummy.  OK but I was hoping for more.

Takes way too long for the game it is (took 5 players 1 hour). The ambushes spoil the game a bit and completely at random. It reminded me of the days when I played Magic against control decks, you keep planning for great plays and then one card spoils everything you've done so far. Not fun.

Take a card, play it or add to your set. Try to make random card plays for quick points. Game is simple, especially if you can get focused on main mechanics quickly, however it is still not very exciting. Maybe subsequent plays could change my rating, but I expect that not much.

I set up a 4 player game to play solo, just to get a feel for this one, to see if I actually would want to play it.  I think this will be a fun game to try with a larger group, if only because the selection in my collection is limited for 6  players...
---
Not bad. Certainly not great either, though. I'm not sure what's lacking in this game. It flows well enough and there is some tension, but a thread I read suggested that a trading theme would better suit the game since the "attack" cards actually are like forced trading cards and i think i agree. Really, a retheme might be all this one could have used to make it a game I'd want to play with larger groups of non gamers.  It's a bit late to get Uwe to change it at this point though...

RATING: 6
This game could be explained in 2 minutes, but it took our group 15-20 minutes to figure out because the rules were poorly written. It shouldn't take more than 2 pages to describe this game, and instead it had like 8 pages. The game is about collecting sets of cards and turning them in for VP. The theme is pretty thin, but this is a card game. There are seven 'suits', but no rank. Instead each suit has gold piece values (essentially VP), ranking from 8 to 13 GP. A player's turn is: 1) Reveal a new card from the deck; 2) Decide whether to put into hand (to apply toward the set), or use the 'power' of the card--set up an ambush, steal, trade, or block another card; 3) Declare a set or collect GP on a completed assignment (getting 5-of-a-kind, 3x pairs, 4x pairs, all 7 suits), which give very high GPs. When another player attempts to declare a set, an ambush may be sprung taking a card from that set, voiding it. Because of the various interactions the cards offer, cards can move from player to player fairly quickly. Very simple, very quick, very good filler game. I was surprised to see this is from the same designer as Agricola and Le Havre.

Update (01/20/12): Initial rating was an '8'. Given that I now detest designs by Uwe Rosenberg, I just don't see the relationship between any of these games. It's like Uwe got fixated at making his designs fiddly with lots of bits, and this is such a simple, clean design. What went wrong? This is a far more accessible game. However, it's coming up on 3 years, and I don't miss this game, nor do I want to get it. Dropping it to a '6'.

Set making game.  This one depends on the players.  Some games it plays really long as everyone makes 3 card sets.  Other times everyone goes for the large point items and the game is over before you know it.

RATING: 5
Fun if played quickly, as the decisions should be very quick and easy to make.  It's best if you approach this game as a trading game where sometimes the trading is forced, in which you're just trying to collect sets of cards.  I don't necessarily care for the theme, but it doesn't bother me either.  Ultimately it's a harmless game that doesn't leave me wanting to play it again, but I would play if someone else suggested it.

An interesting card game with trading choices based upon what card you draw.

It can play up to 7 so I plan to keep it around since one of my game groups enjoys larger group games.  Outside of that factor, there's nothing too special about this game.

Set collection and a bit of take-that card play; but with a twist on the take-that.

Even though there is a wealth of card stealing and forced bidding, you always get a card in exchange; making the actions risky at times.

There are opportunities for keeping track of cards gained as well as seeing player hands.

While it's random our games have been rather close. It really needs to be played briskly for maximum enjoyment.

Finally, I cannot see playing this with more than 4-5 players.

A fun set collection game with some hidden, some open, and some "need to remember" info.  The interaction between players feels a bit forced, and also rewards players who are in the mood to remember what cards have gone into other people's hands.  However, I won even while generally (not totally) ignoring what cards other people had.  I most enjoyed the fact that a 9-year old played with the sole purpose of messing with his father, who still cam in second.

A decent card game, which seems to work much better if people focus on set-collecting rather than on using the cards' actions (otherwise I feel the game drags a bit).

This game's biggest asset is that it plays up to 7 (and handles 7 players fairly well, I thought, if the above paragraph is taken into account).  However, there are other short-ish card games that I prefer that play up to 5 or 6 (e.g., Parade (plays up to 6), Die Sieben Siegel (plays up to 5)).

In this card game, there are seven different cards with values ranging from 7 to 13.  There are twelve copies of each card. One attempts to collect sets of threes (ranging from 7 to 13 VPs), or to use more cards to fulfill objectives (eg five of a kind, four pairs) for more points. On your turn, you  draw a card to either keep the card or use the card's special ability (exchange the card with an opponent, draw an ambush card, etc). Ambush cards allow you to prevent an opponent from cashing a set. It's a fun, light game, with a theme based on the Sheriff of Nottingham using his deputies to collect taxes.

Played three times now.  Best if played at a good pace - if players take too long on their turns the game drags and wears out its welcome - espeically with more than 4 players.

A fine little trading game - not up to Rosenberg's Bohnanza, but pleasant enough.

A pleasant enough card collecting, set collecting game, with the feature that if you don't want the card you turn over, you have the option of playing its event instead in an effort to inveigle a desired card out of someone else in exchange. It has the advantage of playing up to 7 players, and even with a large number of players, you seem to be generally in the game, either responding to events or potentially collecting cards when other players score a set.

Adequate little filler with some nice hosing abilities in the 9 card.  Set collection tends not to be my thing, as I try for everything at once, and I hate being the target in these sorts of games when I feel I'm behind, so it'll never get much more than a shrug of acquiescence from me.

I liked the elegance of this game. Relatively simple ruleset. Choice of strategic options without an overwhelming number. Some uncertainty regarding the leader. Some minor direct conflict in the ability to select (for trade) a valuable resource card from an opponent. Artwork and color of cards is lively with overall nice graphic design. The only minor complaint I have is the non-intuitive depiction, at the base of each card, of the special "trading" rules for each card. I'm not a great fan of "special powers" (e.g. Shadows over Camelot) mostly because I can't remember them all, and the graphic artwork alone, while nicely done, didn't make it easy to remember them on first play...I found myself having to continually ask questions such as "Now what is this card's special trading ability?". A player's aid would have helped out nicely. The ambush tactic didn't get used that much, but was a unique twist. I really like this one.

Parece complicado mas é um jogo muito facil de comecar a jogar.

Consegue ser divertido, todavia, deveria ser mais curto, pois prolonga-se um bocado e ja nao deixa vontade de jogar um segundo jogo. Gostei do facto do autor ter colocado a pontuaçao das cartas de 7 a 13, o que faz com que nenhumas duas cartas possam valer menos do que qualquer outra isolada. A experimentar e jogar de vez em quando...

Light fun with lots of flavor.  You try to collect sets of cards by 'trading' something bad for something good from other players.  Not a negotiation or trading game.  A little mean in that you're alwaysjrobbing someone else, but so light as to completely negate the meanness.  Beatifully illustrated, quite thematic for a German game.  Box says 3-7 players, but I think it would drag very much with more than 4 players!

--Sept2008-- One trades cards a lot here; enough so that forward planning is entirely at the mercy of your peers.  In principle, one can count cards as they appear and be able to take advantage of that information in one's turn:  in practice, the game plays one as much as the reverse.  Several of the cards permit no choice - and if those are the ones that come up for you, you have little recourse.
I expect I'd play it again if someone I knew was particularly enthusiastic, but I doubt I'd ever suggest it.

Quick paced with a decent amout of interaction and a few choices to make. Ultimately it's just another card game with a pasted on theme. The good thing about this one is that it'll play in about 30 minutes with up to seven players. The quick end and luck of who scores when means some control over scoring and picking up free cards is not that great, and that's how I feel about this game. It's okay, but there's no meat on this bone.

This isn't a bad game, it is just that came late into my gaming life, a point in which I see every [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15878]rummy[/url][/i] like game of this kind just as the one before and the one after.  Yes, it is another game in which players try to set collections of cards to be exchanged for points.  We made a mistake on our play that caused the game to last longer.  I believe that played in the proper way the strategy of the game may level up, but not as much as to change my mind about it.

A very decent little set collection game that takes up to 7! players. Players are deputies of Nottingham trying to get the most points from various activities.

Each turn, a card (7 different types) is turned over and the player either takes it or activates its special ability. These range from 'take that' cards to defensive cards. The active player can then trade in a set of at least 3 cards to score points or try to complete one of 4 missions.

The game ends when all missions are completed or when the Sheriff reaches Nottingham.

Simple, fast, some interesting decisions. The action cards are smart as is the simplicity of the scoring. Much better than I expected.

Card, Set Collection. My GB descriptions of a "take that rummy game" are pretty accurate, although you can't screw someone too badly -- even when you steal from them, they get the attack card into their hand as a good.

High luck level, even higher chaos factor.

My game felt the equivelant of: I hope I draw a card I can use, I hope that someone picks my hand when I need their card, I hope someone doesn't pick my hand now, I hope no one plays a spoiler on me when I try to score, I hope I can get the special set cards before other people can. Cue the trombones.  

Most of my game felt dependent on the draw and what other players chose for me.

It's "take-that" rummy.  I couldn't wait for this to end.

The one very good thing about this game is that the Eight card features a man about to do something terribly filthy and all the other players in the other cards are talking about it.

Sure, its "take-that rummy", but it is also light, fun and engaging card game that can be brought out any time for a large group as either a warm up or night cap. I really like the mechanics in this one where you draw a card and can either use the ability or store in your hand. And, I also liked the trade of cards. So if you play a card on someone, they don't just lose out but get something in return. I rather enjoyed the game and would definitely play again.

It's an interesting set collection game. There are several kinds of cards numbered 7-13. Each also has a special power associated with it. Players are dealt a starting hand. On your turn, you turn over the top card and choose: either add the card to your hand, or use it's special power (e.g., take a random card from someone's hand, force everyone to offer a card from which you select one to trade the random card with, etc.). Then, you may choose to meld cards. Minimum meld is 3 cards, but you may meld more because one of the special powers is Ambush, which allows players to steal a card from someone trying to meld if it meets certain qualifications. Whatever the size of the meld, you keep 1 card (worth it's number of points at game end). Instead of melding, you can also try to "complete a mission". There are 4 types of "missions": 3 pairs, 4 pairs, 1 of each, 5 or a kind. The first 2 people to complete each mission get points (ranging from 10-30 depending on which mission, and whether 1 or 2 people have completed it). Whenever someone plays cards, a Sheriff token is advanced on the board. Each space has a number; players with that number of cards or fewer get to draw from the draw pile. The Sheriff is also a timer - the game ends if he advances to the last space on the board (or if all missions are completed). The player with the most points wins.

This is a set-collection games with some interesting twists because of the card powers. There is a constant stream of cards, partially under your control. You have to decide between trying to cash out quickly to score small points and keep your hand size low (to keep drawing cards) or collect a large hand which makes you a target for others to steal from but also allows you to fulfill large-point missions. I'd like to try it again with fewer players, but it is a pretty good, light game.

This was the best new game I played at the Gathering 2006. I enjoyed the anticipation of turning over my card. Call me nuts, but it felt like Carcassonne meets Rummy.

Played 3+ times.  Lots of ways to take cards from others.  A little too much 'take that' for my tastes, but it's reasonably short so I don't mind playing.  I played a variant that made it a bit more nasty but it seemed to balance the strength of the sets of 3 and the bonus cards and we actually finished a route around through the woods.  The variant worked but I think it lengthened the game a little. **update** We'd been playing with a rule wrong.  The sheriff advances if you fulfill a special goal and that balanced the strength of the two methods for getting points.  The game felt much more polished.  rating up .5 2006/09/24

The iconography can be taxing for the first few minutes - though there are excellent player aids here on the geek -  but what follows is a fresh, unique set collection card game that scales to perfection.

For some,  there may be a bit too much of the "take that" element present here,  but it is not quite as disruptive in this implementation as it is in other games.  In fact,  I consider it more a form of mild chaos than a true "take that" mechanic.  In any case,  this is a game I will always be up for.

Very light, and pretty random - you don't really have much control over what's left in your hand by the time it's your turn again.  Thematically a bit odd - "I'm going to rob / steal from / ambush you - but give you these other valuables in exchange."  Not a bad filler, but nothing spectacular.

First play - 7 players. Only 2 players had played this before. The rules were very simple and just about everyone got it on the first explanation. Not a lot of ambushes were played so everyone was able to play their trips. I think only 2 people were caught near the end of the game. No one was able to snag a 5-of a kind mission and the 3-pair missions went early. I was able to get the second 'one of each" mission and 3 trips. The player to my right had the same exact scoring pile but he had one point more in his 3 trips!

A pretty fun, if somewhat light, game. I really like that most information is public or can be fairly easily deduced. I haven't figured out if there's a logic behind the number of cards to get favors (it seems like there is, but I haven't been able to get it to work to my advantage). Probably could've benefited with a slight reduction in play time, but it's not excessively long for what it is. Also always nice to have games that support 7.

A simple card game where you collect sets of cards. When you flip a card, you have the option of taking that card's action (which usually involves getting a card from another player while that player gets the card in question).

I'd like to try it with a bigger group to see how it flows.

Good set collection card game with a teeny little board.  Who wouldn't want to be a rotten, crooked tax collector?

Played twice (with 6 players). I have been pleasantly surprised by this game (maybe I expected something closer to Bohnanza, which I dislike). There is some randomness or targetting possibilities, but not as much as you could fear, and playing it was quite enjoyable.

Fun little set collection card game.  The stealing and related activity is easy on those that abhor confrontation because players are always left with something.  It is fairly short with a good amount of interaction.

I'm happy to have added this to our games available for larger group play. It's a lighter game, but there are decisions to be made. It's suitable for occasional play as you can go over each card's options again as it comes up. The artwork for the suits could be more obvious (or they could have the suit numbers on the ambush cards). The ambush mechanic seems a little weak to me.

Card game that presents interesting decisions each turn - whether to cash in the current card or to use its special ability, many of which attack other players. You need to plan slightly ahead to be aware of possible card draws  and manage your hand size in tune with the Sheriff's rewards. This can be a bad-ass game for players not afraid to play nasty with each other all in the name of fun. Game is easy to teach, plays quickly and is a pretty good filler.

Nice card game, players try to collect cards in order to fulfill the objectives (and gain points). There are some special rules that lead into lots of interaction, which adds more fun to the game.

Bought this at the UK Game Expo yesterday (31/05/08) from the A1 Comics stand.

The card powers seemed comically bad, at first, with virtually every action being a variant of 'stealing'.  After playing it for a few rounds, it made a little more sense, and wasn't as bad as it first appeared.

Maybe not the best game of its kind, but I thought it made for a really enjoyable experience.

Can't get it.. It is slowly dawning on me that Mr. Rosenberg may not be my ideal designer. After all, I have not that much of fun for playing Agricola.

I really enjoy this with 5+ players, you need to have a dealer/caller for this to work best, one player draws the cards and calls for the current player to make his choices, the dealer/caller keeps everyone's attention on the current player and calls out the needed actions and rules responses, plays brilliantly this way at parties!

This is a fun filler that plays fast... but can run a little long.  The special powers on the cards really make the game... but our group spends a lot of time merely collecting the cards they draw (and therefore not using the powers...)

RATING: 7
Clever game that is simpler (and deeper) than first appears.  Players who pay attention to what's going on, who's collecting what and who actually *has* what will fare better than those who dismiss it as a "take that" luckfest.

Juego de cartas en el que influye la suerte; pero estÃ¡ bien, aÃºn sin ser una maravilla; Importante: permite jugar hasta 7 jugadores.

The fairest, most polite game of attacking your opponents I've ever seen.  Quite a nice way to pass an hour, too!  ...and yes, it really does work with seven players.  It also functions just fine with three players, but the more the merrier!

After 1 Play: Luck is far more important that your choices in determining outcome, and really there's simply nothing about this game that makes me want to play it again.

Set collection with a few twists yet simple and enjoyable. The problem with most set collection games is they're too much like Rummy (so why play them instead of Rummy?) or they're too clever for their own good. This one avoids both traps. The different symbols takes some getting used to for new players.

Revela una carta del mazo. Lleva a cabo su acción especial o consérvala (joyas y tesoros). Si tienes suficientes cartas para reclamar un objetivo puedes comerciarlas, pero puede que otro jugador haya jugado una carta de emboscada con tu color.

Easy to learn with many options on each turn. 
similar to Finca but without the set collection aspect.

Players move around the board with their 5 pieces - each with a special ability.  First player to place a banner on each segment wins.  Movement rules reminiscent of the windmill in Finca, with the option to pay bribes to modify movement.  Great stuff!

A lovely reminder that "simple" doesn't equal "light".

RATING: 7
Fun, light, mostly abstract game.  It is like the rondel part of Finca becomes it own game.  Fun to play best out of three.  I almost never complain about what games cost, but 40 bucks retail is too high considering the number of components in the game.

Mandala with variable powers sort of thing
but it's interesting to think through the options.

A tad biased since this is my best friends game but I honestly look forward to it anytime we end up playing it.  Well designed, simple concept but hidden strategy and never feel too bogged down on turns.

Picked this up b/c it was $12; didn't expect much due to the low rating (4400?!), but it had good components and looked okay.  Played a 3-player game today and thought it was great. Easily in the top 1000, not 4000. Give it a chance.

This game has a really cool idea, and mostly it works well. In fact mostly I think it's a great family game, but I'm really not a fan of bash the leader stuff in my games and so it suffers a bit for that.

Moving characters on a rondel-like modular board. Area majority. Plenty of "take that" and king making elements.

Clever little game of variable player powers that feels like an abstract.  Manipulating movement options is the key here. I could see how this could begin to feel a little dry.

Great very easy to learn game, to win it you have to think several turns in advance, good for kids and grown ups.

It has easy rules and plays, but can suffer from AP, certainly near the end. And you'll probably have some bashing-on-the-leader to. In Europe it's way overpriced: Officially the MSRP is 46 euro and even if you can find it for 40 euro, that's way too much for the little components (of poor US Quality) you get and it being a mediocre game.

Will get bored after 5 or 6 games with 2 players, like playing a chess with 3 players, 4 players is not recommended. An ok game

RATING: 3
Has the mechanic from [thing=40628][/thing] that is cool. You move the number of spaces depending on how many occupy the space you are leaving from. I like that, but this game is about getting your banners/ influence out and it is VERY difficult to do that. Could possibly be the never ending game. It was nice for 10 minutes then at 30 minutes we all stopped and we were MAYBE halfway through. It seemed like no progress was happening. It was just far too long for what it was. This is a game I won't have to revisit.

Great at two players.  With more, it can turn into bash the leader until everyone else has caught up.

The rondel aspect of the game is exceedingly clever. But it's ruined by the take-that, bash-the-leader, and king-making elements, which I hate with the fire of 1,000 suns...

2 plays with 2 players, 1 with 4 players, excellent game. interesting all throughout, down time included, long and meaningful but never feels heavy, really surprised with this game's strategic depth. will never turn down a chance to play it. art and components are amazing, the character art really adds to the theme. excellent artistic choices. highly recommended game.

REALLY loved the Finca-style movement, and the deep gameplay that results from it. I played a friend's copy, but I may have to get my own for my other group.

This is a simple little abstract (with a medieval theme of sorts). You put together a board, made of a bunch of double-sided pie wedges. Each wedge has a different action. Players have a set of 5 pieces -- we placed these randomly during setup but you could take turns and be more deliberate. On your turn, you can first opt to bribe first (spend 1-4 coins for a special power). Then move one of your pieces clockwise, exactly 1 wedge per piece on its starting wedge. When it lands, you do something depending on the character moved (place a banner on the wedge if you have majority of pieces there; steal money; get money; activate a different character; etc.). The first player to place all their banners (1 on each wedge) wins immediately.

Interesting, but I'm not a fan of abstract games and this felt very abstract to me.

Played 2- and 3-player. Looks like another soulless Euro, but there are some fun decisions to be made. Very well designed, but the narrow wedges get awfully crowded sometimes. Love how quick playing it is, though there can be some tough decisions to be made.

Wife and I were just pleasantly surprised by this one. First time playing it, we were both impressed at how strategic yet easy it played.

You have 6 pieces that all do seperate actions. On your turn, you can spend money, move a character and then perform its action. It's strategic like chess, but not as deep and contains a monitary aspect to it.

We really enjoyed this but both agreed, this should've been marketed only for 2 players. With 4 players, this game would be rediculously long and hard to play. As a 2 player game though, this is a lot of fun!

A bit dry, but I like it regardless.  The artwork is unfortunately unnecessarily cartoony. Seems a bit under appreciated despite being a solid light abstract strategy game.  I found it deeper and more interesting than Finca which also has a rondel. What it lacks in comparison are bright colors and lots of fruit meeples.

(10/2010)  After 1 3p game - Played in protoype form as part of the Rio Grande qualifier contest and this was a very entertaining play.  

"Finca" like movement, a modular board which changes with the # of players, quick turns, lots of game decisions.   A nice compact "superfiller" which would see a lot of play if published.  

In the future, look to see if it wins ChiTAG 2010 RGG prototype contest, enters the Kickstarter program, gets picked up by another publisher, or goes the self publish route.

Very simple rules, but the abstractions in the "think space" make it very challenging to take your first few turns. Definitely an original-feeling game, with a healthy amount of replay value, due to the flippable, rearrangeable world pieces. Also, it's a tricky, sneaky game — but not in a painful way: With three players, it was extremely close, even though one was laden with cash the whole game, one was utterly broke the whole game, and the third floated somewhere in the middle.

Oh, and it looks like pizza when it's set up. :p

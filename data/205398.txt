After playing about 6 times with family I have to admit that this game is truly entertaining. I can't wait to play the more "aggressive" variations with my friends.

Beautiful to luck at, easy to teach and the more you learn about what  characters can and can't do, the more you will enjoy it. 

Zee Garcia said that this new version of the game is essential  and I agree with him once more.

In Citadels, players take on new roles each round to represent characters they hire in order to help them acquire gold and erect buildings. The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects their eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.

RATING: 8
On the one hand, the box comes in a much bigger box than the earlier FFG edition, with little to show for it. But the Tarot-card size for the roles are nice (as long as you sleeve them!) and satisfying to pass around and reveal. The new artwork is brighter and gives a friendly tone, which may or may not be a good idea.

RATING: 8
The mechanics of this game are simple and elegant, but provide for a lot of interaction, strategy, and replay-ability. The rules are fairly simple - each person picks a role card and then cards are activated in a set order. Role cards are secret and can lead to second guessing and plotting against players. 

My friend describes this as "the game where the most evil person wins". 

It's possible for someone to join late in the game, they probably won't win, but because the game is played in rounds they can still participate. 

Possible replacement: Libertalia

Not a big hit with my family, but still a solid design featuring many "take that" mechanisms, which I am generally not too fond of.

RATING: N/A
The different role cards provide high variability of the game.

Game can be speed up by including Architect into the role cards.  Architect allow the player to build 2 buildings in one turn.  Often, with Architect players will build buildings with cheaper cost to rush for the end game.

Diplomat is a much better role than Warlord.  Often the player who uses Warlord ability will lose coins just to destroy another player district which is not gaining him or her anything and will put him behind.

Queen is good when there is less players like 5.  The probability of getting oneself beside the King/Emperor is higher.

Also, choosing Queen is good because most often player will not target the Queen with Witch or Thief.

Bishop is much better than Abbot.  It can be hard to be able to trigger Abbot's ability.  Bishop can be a safeguard to any possible target of ill effect by a player.

Quite enjoy this game, Trying to anticipate what role your opponents may take is challenging and interesting, and combining that with the hand management and set collection makes for an intriguing game. Have been hesitant to try it with the more 'take that' characters available, as I don't particularly like that sort of gameplay, but willing to give them a try. Hoping to play it more!

A city building card game with the bluffing touch, Citadels is one successful story of a reimplementation (or should I say, reprint) of the renowned Citadels that was published in 2000. The new Citadels offers not only the better and more beautiful artworks, but also another gameplay variation. Luck is still something that would favour the winner, but the player can still manage to win with good deduction skill in order to keep the city grows. This party game is not simple. Citadels needs a constructive mind that drafts the strategy in each round.

Citadels is super easy to learn but has a great amount of player interaction. Drafting your card can be really tough as taking the role you optimally want will most likely be stopped by an opponent. The game is super streamlined and comes with a load of characters for high replay value. A highly enjoyable game that is suitable for most players.

I was able to demo at GenCon 2016. It was a blast. Never played first edition.

I bought this as a strategic game that we could play at higher player counts. Only actually played it with 3 so far, it's a fun game.

Good value purchase!

Can be enjoyable with enough people.  The role-selection mechanic is wedded to a  poor construction mechanic. I feel like they do not compliment each other like they should. More tacked on scoring to solid mechanics.

A Classic Game of Building Cities and Drafting Characters

As one of the kingdom’s great builders, you have been commissioned to build a new city from the ground up. But while you shape the city of your dreams, you must watch out for your opponents - they will do anything to ruin your plans and stop your city from being completed.

In Citadels, you and your opponents vie to build the most magnificent medieval city. Designed by Bruno Faidutti and first published in 2000, Citadels has become one of the most popular games of the modern era.

There's a lot of replayability with the amount of roles and unique districts to swap in and out. Feels like a completely different game.

I'd recommend 2 - 3 players as the best player count. Both counts allow players to have 2 roles per round, which allows some sweet combos.

Probably the best iteration of the game. Comes with 27 different character/roles more Unique buildings and a slight streamlining of the rules. MY only quibble is games can be a tad long with certain characters in play. I usually avoid including those in most setups, unless I'm playing with veterans.

Even with the newest version, the game shows its age in the design. Best with 3-5 players, 6-8 you're asking to kill yourself

New characters are great and they are fully capable of replacing the original ones.

The best mode to play is to mix all the characters and unique districts and draw randomly the required amount.  This way each game should be a new experience...

Owned the previous 2000 version, and was never a huge fan of the game. This version gives it a little more variety and looks a lot nicer, but I'm still not the biggest fan of the gameplay. There can be too much downtime for other players when a single player spends too much time analyzing their character choice. I prefer games where hidden roles are all chosen at the same time, i.e. Mission: Red Planet.

While I haven't tried all the characters yet what I see is enough to make me want to play this game over and over again! After a couple of plays it kinda feels a bit mean to me so I could mess with presets to have a more enjoyable experience. Also, it has some kingmaking issues.

A 2005-ös kiadást cseréltem le erre a "deluxe", magyar kiadásra és nem bántam meg.

Grafikailag nagyon gyönyörű és van benne pluszban annyi új karakter, ami miatt megéri a váltás.

Nem ismétlem magam (a 2005-ösnél írtam egy részletesebb értékelőt), de a party játékok között nálam elég előkelő helyen szerepel továbbra is, bár ennyi játék után már kicsit kopott a fénye, de azért még mindig szívesen teszem az asztalra, ha olyan társaságunk van.

Without a doubt one of the games that fits our playgroup the best. We always have a super good time with this. The variations that you can create with all the characters are enormous and will provide much replayability. Also, the art is stunning!

Role selection, deduction and bluffing. Plays well with various player counts, 2 player variant excels. Some roles have cutthroat actions (can be mitigated by swapping out others roles). Should be highly portable with tuck boxes.

One of the first role-selection games that I played. I like that fact that you're focused on "creating stuff" (i.e. buildings) as well as guessing which role your opponents might choose so that you can either try to screw them over, or sneak in a role that benefits you but is a risky gamble to choose. 

Still fun to play in this day & age. 

Rated based on original game, which I've replaced with the 2016 edition.

Fresh update which not only streamlines the playing time, it also adds new characters and suggests many different setups depending on how you like to play (Beginner, Advanced, Cut throat, etc).

I've played this two-player with my wife countless times and it never loses it appeal.  Simple enough for anyone to play, but sufficiently deep to keep more hardcore gamers engaged.  Good player interaction, lots of replayability, and plays well at all player counts.  The tactics and short-term strategies are actually more interesting and intense in a two-player (with the game being lighter, more freewheeling, and unpredictable at the higher player counts), so I actually prefer that.

Important note for TWO PLAYER games (only): as with the 2000 version, the "1" cards (the Assassin, Witch, and now the new card, the Magistrate) are overpowered (IMO) and will have a relatively outsized influence on the game outcome if used.  I highly recommended using the 2-9 numbered cards (not 1-8).  Otherwise, the game becomes too much about who uses the Assassin, Witch, etc. the best, because their effect in a two player game is so devastating/unbalancing.

Relative to the 2000 version, there are more characters to choose from to mix things up, plus the card quality is better (though I dislike the much darker artwork on the building cards), so it is a worthwhile upgrade if you have the older version and enjoy the game.  Also, if you play mainly two players with the 2-9 cards, I think you'll appreciate the fact that you have an additional option at the "9" position (other than just the Artist): the Tax Collector (which was moved from the "2" position in the 2000 version).

A standars at our board game weekly, but in the older edition. The new edition adds a nice selection of additional characters with so,e really fun ones and a list of preselections.

A really fantastic effort by Faidutti to bring a 10 year old design up-to-date. While the bones of the game still have the same pluses and minuses that the original had, a very welcome expansion of characters has added a much-needed level of customization to the game.

That these new roles are also exciting to play is icing on the cake, as they help to craft an experience of the game to the player's tastes. My games of Citadels are now finishing up faster, funnier, and closer than the original edition ever did.

Solid game that unfortunately suffers from too much downtime. The character roles are quite well balanced, making every decision meaningful, but without anything to do or any way to react to an opponents turn, the game can drag on depending on the group.

RATING: 6
It's hard to decide what to rate this game, but I'm going with a 6.  At 2P, we loved this.  It was really fun!  There was some strategy in being able to select which characters you wanted to be each round (out of a couple options) while still not knowing what your opponent had.  It is light and plays relatively quickly, but setup is rather painful for as quick as the game plays out.  (Unless you sort your cards out and bag them up in groups, rather than sort through the deck to pull out what you need every time.)

At 4P+, though...this game went from enjoyable to awful.  The first player got to pick their card, and everyone else got stuck with whatever blind draw they got.  That basically removes the strongest element of strategy from the game, and also means the first player has a serious advantage.  We've argued and argued about how this could be done differently, and have not come up with any other solution everyone agrees is fair.  At this point I'm very glad I didn't buy this to play with the whole (larger) family over the holidays, because it would have gone over even worse than it did at 4P.

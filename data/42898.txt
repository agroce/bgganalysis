A nice idea, tabletop battles without tons of expensive miniatures and super long playtimes.  Unfortunately, the ruleset is not good.  We may have played something wrong, but I hated it enough to never try again to find out what we might have done wrong.

RATING: 8
Tactical, fun, fast. I prefer to play "to the pain" -- until one player concedes, rather than until half of a player's army is removed. This makes games a little longer. Gaesatae are overpowered, so hopefully the designer will modify their traits.

Are you freakin' kidding me?  A "miniatures" game that understands counters are more effective than plastic?  That gorgeous art-work can still be effective despite diminutive counters?  That simple is almost always better, as long you're not insulting the intelligence of your audience?

This is such a surprise hit in my house that I'm just astonished at its simple, beautiful elegance every time we play it.  I mean, a few tokens and some dice can compete with Commands and Colors: Ancients?  No board, no hexes, no line-of-sight rules...just this very "organic" wargaming experience.

Great series.  Lots of choices.  I guess the gripe on it is that it takes as long to pick your army as it does to play the game, but neither one takes long, so who cares?
Great system.  Very luck dependent, but plenty of strategy (assembling units, assigning orders) for such a small-scale game.

Overall Pocket Battles
I like how this gives you that nostalgic feeling of playing warhammer fantasy when you were 12.

Real quick and easy to carry.

Army building is 1/2 the game and not so complicated that it really takes too long to build a army (except maybe the first time).

Crashing the two armies into each other is pretty quick but meaty enough to make you want to play again to improve your army and update your tactics.





Romans are a good starter army.  Not too many abilities, a good spread of dice mostly focused on the charge into battle.

Celts are the finesse army.  Mobile, Fast, and tricksy.
Takes a few games to compete against the Romans but they can hold their own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
A new game for me, wasn't even sure about it for the first five or so games. Pretty clever though, and does a good job in abstracting a lot of things important in miniatures games. I feel the Celts have it a little tough most of the time but sometimes it goes spectacularly well. More play needed, always a good sign in a game.

RATING: 5
As promised, a pocket-sized battle. But a couple of bad rolls at the start can doom you quickly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The simplest form of ancient warfare. Lining up facing each other with flanks but no flanking rules.

It's blade against blade or dice against dice.

The special powers are meant as a modifier or additional dice to reflect battlefield changes and advantages.

No terrain, no ambush. Just pure muscles against muscles. Multiple types of units, but overall, feels almost similar. It's only some initial or engagement bonus here and there that gives you a feel of what that unit can do. In fact, after a few games, what the name and title of unit becomes not important. It's just the icons and what numbered die is on the unit.

It's a good battle by itself, ends in round 2-3 for a 80 pointer. May reach round 4 for a 100 pointer game. Done in 45mins.

Having said that, it becomes low on replayability and felt the overall battle is not fully felt and enjoyed as an ancient battle game.

Good lunch time game session. Small, compact, simple. 

Not for the heavy Wargamers.

Nice little 2-player tactical filler game. I really like the 'build your own army' aspect of the game. Actually half the game is decided during unit selection and starting positions. The game plays quickly (perhaps too quickly) and the components are nice. If you want something a bit more challenging with a bit more debth take a look at Summoner Wars.

Initial play was pretty positive.  I hadn't read the rules, and my opponent was teaching from an earlier reading, so we started out pretty blind.  I tend to hate icons over text, and this was no exception, including the weird "my player aid is the only list for some of your special abilities" factor.  Didn't really enjoy counting out the armies either, but once we played I thought it flowed pretty well.  Look forward to more plays of it.  Feels kinda like Clash of the Gladiators to me in the "build the best unit composition" way, but I like it a lot better.

One of my favourite games, at the moment the first of wargames I played. I really enjoy with that fast and "bloody" combats.

After trying Pocket Battles ... I was thoroughly underwhelmed :(.  I had been thinking, "$10, this is great, right?"  Nope.  This is one of the few games I've purchased that I did regret afterward.  

I found that this simple battle didn't offer as much strategy as I had anticipated.  It seemed that one side or the other would quickly get an upper hand, and with that advantage, this team would easily rout the other.  With this seemingly natural progression usually happening, the motivation to continue playing after one person has taken the lead diminishes greatly.  

Even before the game play began, I found the rulebook lacking.  I understand that this game intends to be small and quick and simple ... hence the genre of "pocket" battles, but shortchanging the rulebook to make it as small and concise as possible doesn't sit too well if it ultimately causes more confusion than convenience.

Takes too long to build your army, then the game is too simple and too short. Admirable attempt, but in this space I'll play C&C Ancients every time. This has portability and price going for it, but the play experience itself is just lacking. Plus, I really hate taking all that time to build the army up-front.

RATING: 8
Very straightforward and fun little game.  Plays quickly and simply and is perfect for a quick game.  There are some interesting choices to make about what to take, what to sacrifice and what to order throughout.  The difference between engagement dice and shooting dice makes for some interesting balances, and the special abilities add a lot of nice extra elements that spice up game play.  I don't think this is meant to be taken too seriously - it is a good quick romp of a battle game, and great fun at that.

Ten minutes to build your army. One minute to do battle. A lot of nice concepts here, but the very short (and bloody) battles don't leave a lot of room for strategy on the battle field.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think this is probably a fine game for people that are into this sort of thing, but I just didn't find it extremely exciting.

The coolest part to me is the ability for players to build their own armies.  Each army has a build cost, and before each battle, players build their armies according to an agreed upon number of build points.  So, the options for replayability in this game are nearly limitless!

Once the game starts, it's all about positioning and playing the odds.  Like any battle game, you just put yourself in the best position you can and hope to get a little help from the dice.

However, for me, there were a few too many fiddly little rules that weren't intuitive enough to easily keep track of.  I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem if I liked the game more and wanted to play it more often, but it was a little cumbersome the first time out.  Unfortunately, I just didn't like the game enough to gain this familiarity with the game to make it play more smoothly.

RATING: 4
Huh. So many good comments, so I bought the game. But the rulebook is a complete mess. Not so much wrong, but just hard to understand. Either not written by a native English speaker, or written by someone who has no business writing rules. Sorry. I've slogged through a couple hours of trying to figure the game out. Which is just too much for a game barely bigger than a deck of playing cards. But there are some nice ideas there for a small combat game. While in theory it scales in time based on the number of troop points you allow per side, with a small battle, you will likely spend more time choosing your troops than actually playing. And losing one key battle from a bad die roll can decide the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The idea is not bad, but the result is a rather boring game, mainly because the best combinations are in general obvious and the games are too short and the charges too strong.

We now play with random units and without using the +1 die for charging and we are back in the game! Is a real nice filler for two players.

Fast play tactical war game in which two players build their army up to a certain level and then position their troops (bundled together in multi-troop battle units) on the left or right wing or the center of the battlefield, either in the front or the back section. Each individual troop has a certain number of ranged and/or melee battle dice printed on it, determining at which die roll they score a hit. A lot of the troops also have special abilities. The game does seem to be unbalanced. The Romans appear to be the far stronger side, which is historically correct, but less fun in a game of which you would expect both players to have roughly the same opportunity to win. A battle seasoned Celtic leader can win from an inexperienced Roman leader...but would this also be the case against a strong Roman leader?

Quite clever in picking up the different capabilities of units and the key strategies of ancient battles (maintain a line, closing with heavy troops, fending off with auxilliaries) and yet it plays really, really fast.
I do have a concern that you can mix any old tiles into a unit so that its possible to get a massive cataphract bonus for a unit made up of mostly cheap disposible units.
It seems quite unbalanced too since we have not been able to get a Celt win yet. There are some clear examples of similar units costing more for the Celts.

But we'll play this often enough since its a quick way to wind down after a heavier wargame. We'll just handicap the Romans by giving them fewer points to build with.

Players fight a "miniatures" battle, taking either the Romans or Celts.  Simple game where players draft troops to a point value, arrange them into formations, and deploy them into left/centre/right and front/rear sections.  From there they fight it out using a simple order and dice system.  Takes as long to set it up as it does to play, literally.  The game is cheap, pleasant and very light and random.  Great attempt and concept, just not a great game.

Brilliant: a tabletop minis game that has been whittled down into a card format. Customize from a menu of troops to build your army, then slug it out. Each troop grants its unit more hit potential and/or special powers. Fast, tactical, fun! Highly recommended!!

A surprisingly involved pocket game involving battle tactics with a Romano-Gallic theme, this version of Pocket Battles is pretty entertaining once in a while, but the balancing seems suspect to me, and can be frustrating when a good stack is annihilated by some chance die rolls.

  A inexpensive cardboard mini ancient battle game. There are some interesting mechanics although the Celt/Roman battles are a bit limited.  Regardless of the game mechanics this is really a dice game in the 90% luck category.

One note:  The Celts included are around the 300BC to 70AD army type while the Roman Army seems to be a late Roman around 300AD to 400AD model.  Not really a historical matchup.

- While easy to transport, still requires a moderate amount of table space once all units are spread out across three sections.
- Perhaps the game is a bit too light. Then again it is a quick moving game.
- Rules could have been written a little more clearly.  
- No Terrain. I guess Terrain wasn't a huge factor in 
most Ancient battles? *shrug*

Need to explore this game a bit more to see if there's any subtelty or is it just a matter of timing the attacks to get the bloodiest punches in.

Light wargame with a very smart set of rules.
Every phase is important; you can lose a game in the composing/deployment phase if you don't have a decent plan.
Chariots charging a veteran pretorian cohort, while Syrian archers try to stop them...who does not like it?

It has dice...and I like dice to simulate those things in a battle that are not under the control of any leader.
Thumbs up!

RATING: 4
Only based on one play, so take with a grain of salt, but this game just seems a little silly.
First of all, it is fairly quick, which makes it a little more palatable. But of the 30 minutes playing it, about 20 is figuring out your army and adding up their values. The actual gameplay is only maybe 10 minutes.
And I guess there might be some strategy in the army-building, but there certainly didn't seem to be any in the actual fighting.
The game came down completely to luck. When you have a 1/6 chance to destroy an entire unit, and a 4/6 chance of doing nothing, and you hit the 1/6 and kill a 5th of their army, it's a little silly.
The game was over in 2 turns...
There's not enough going on here. Sure, it's quick, but for the amount of gameplay you get it would have to take 5 minutes to be worth it.

A few tries later it was much clearer but a note to the designer/publisher - please change it in the second printing.

Apart of that - fun little game.

Engagements end very quickly so there's not a lot of manouvering or decisions to be made once you engage with one of your units.
More hits per unit, making the units last longer would improve the game.

Like the Orcs v Elves set, this is great fun. The armies are a bit blander (fewer traits; many units - e.g. Auxiliaries and Legionaries are quite similar), but it's still good. In fact, I quite like that most units don't have special powers.

Nice easy filler type game of resource management. Buy an ancient style army, position your units, fight it out and try and kill more of the enemy than you lose. Simple fun dice fest really but, some quite nice positional touches and reading the battlefield for opportunities increases the enjoyment of this title.

A light and very bloody wargame with some issues. Firstly the miniature rule book isn't particularly well written, the information's all there, but sometimes you have to hunt for it. Secondly you need to play at least an 80 point battle, otherwise the game's over before it's begun. It's very much a game about hitting first and hitting hard, so I can't think why you wouldn't select your most powerful units, the Roman Cataphracts being particularly devastating. OK, this was only £12, but it was my most disappointing game purchase for some time. After a couple of plays I sold it on.

Compact, quick, and simple to play.  I like the relative limitations in shared 'order/wound' tokens, they encourage attacking while keeping both players well focused.  The heart and depth of this game is in the construction of your 'ultimate' army with careful consideration to troop and collective unit attributes.  Unfortunately I feel less in control of any tactical maneuvers as the combat resolution element is the direct result of the random roll of the dice.  All-in-all, a decent wargame.  Components are impressive.  I'm sure my rating will increase with more play and familiarity.

UPDATE:  This game is well worth the effort to familiarize yourself with the individual troop characteristics.  

Looking forward to the expansion "Elves & Orcs".

RATING: 5
Small box, smaller parts, big area required to play. Armies consist of tiles that are laid out and moved into the battlefield for combat. Multiple plays are required to grasp the best strategies and, with some rolls, you can basically win the game in 2 turns. More balanced than Persians vs Macedonians when we played.

PLUS: army in a box
MINUS: rulebook is weak, dice luck
BIG MINUS: not easy to grasp fully, table space required

This game should really be called WTF Do I Do About the Cataphracts. Still, it's one of the more fun light wargames I've played. The unit composition makes experimentation easy and entertaining, and though the Romans seem favored as the Cataphract units are nearly undefeatable when they're all together as they should be, it's a lot of bang for not much buck. 

I can't recommend this game highly enough, and I'm pretty surprised it's passed me by for this long.

I love this series. These are not serious war games to be used for the better understanding of historic (or fantastical) tactics. They are light games, with TONS of replay ability since you can change the game size and how you build your army each game. I found that for each set I add to my collection my enjoyment of the overall series moves up exponentially. Also...... it fits in your pocket.

Initial play was lots of fun.  Just picking out and setting up the army was entertaining.  I'm still not sure if the battle decisions are terribly meaningful, as it seemed like a lot of back and forth--I kill one of your units--you kill one of mine.  Still, I'd play it again as it seems to hit the spot for a quick, tactical, battle game.

For now, it is for me the light wargame of choice. It is quick and furious. The strategic element is in the choice and deployment of your army. During battle you try to execute what you have planned before. So most important strategic elements are strongly highlighted and the battle is quick and furious AND leting players to execute what they have planned. The battles are quick byt thanks to really intelligent system you can feel them as real ones. And you do not have to move all those units and roll billion times, there are not fights about the rules, and there are not thousants of modificators. This game is great!

Simple fast game with great art. There is more here than smashing units together. Appears to favor Romans until you figure out army composition, deployment, and tactics for the Celts. After that, Cataphracts ain't so scary.

Hmmm. Played 3 games of this today using MvP set. Not sure what I think. It is fast and most of the game play seems to be in the selection and composition of units. The actual battle is over and done pretty quick, 2 or 3 rounds. Not what I was expecting. I'm playing again tomorrow so see what I think after that. To be honest I like pretty much any wargame so I'm happy with the game , just.....surprised !

RATING: 8
A short game in terms of playtime, however the most significant time is spent setting up armies, however this is to be expected because a large part of the strategy is in setting up your initial troops and their formations. Is luck based because of dice rolls and some rolls can ultimately decide a battle, however the individual that devises the best strategy is usually ultimately the victor. This game might go up to a 9 after I try a few more plays.

[u]21-Jan-2014[/u]: I've been curious about tabletop miniatures for a little while now but not really interested in the "craft" aspect of it.  That and the expense.  Pocket Battles seems to be just what I was looking for.  This is another game I discovered through the SGoYT geeklists and glad I did.

This is a miniatures wargame but with tiles, a simple ruleset, and quick-playing, dice-based combat resolution.  The artwork is really well done, IMO.  And while the tiles are small, they are of decent quality.

The fun comes in two forms with this game...building your army through a point system and then actually sending them into battle head to head against your opponent.  There is plenty of strategy in both of those aspects of the game as well as tactical maneuvering and combat.

Currently there are six available factions, each with their own special abilities, and each being able to battle against any other faction, which adds to the fun if you ask me.

Add to this, the small, portable box with a matching price point, and I've found my niche within the tabletop miniatures genre.  Very cool set of games.

Based on only 1 play, but I'm not sure I get it.  Am I playing some rules wrong?  That seems likely since the rule book is very poorly written.  The verdict is still out, though.  I love the art and the compact size.  If I figure out the point of this one and how to quickly get a game or two in, I may like it.  

It's possible that a few of the rules could use some tweaks, too.  I don't like that the wounds an army receives takes away from their actions, or that armies that are attacked (and killed) have no opportunity to respond.  I'm going to check out some FAQs and maybe some of the variations I've heard about and then after a few more plays I'll give this one another vote.

Over-complicated for what should be a simple little skirmish game. I like the presentation quite a bit, but the fact that you can't hit the broad side of a barn with any of your units is pretty frustrating. A little disappointing, as playing with all the sets could be an interesting experience.

Finally got this one to complete the set (thus far 3). Great game, with six armies now available we roll a die to choose armies. The Celts may look weak when you first get a hold of them, but after you realize how to absorb the impetus attacks I think the armies work out to about even, Looking forward to the next sets.

An exceptionally quick two player skirmish in a tiny box, with a very reasonable price tag. Some nice fresh ideas included. The rating is likely to rise.

The game makes much more sense when you apply the wound tokens like Paolo has written on the forums, instead of playing like it is written in the rulebook. Still, I'd like to see some hard data on how the factions have been balanced.

The summary sheets are missing some of the icons.

It's not big, it's not clever, and it's not complex. But there's something about Pocket Battles that really scratches an itch for war-game novices such as myself. The trite playing time is a real boon and the whole thing looks deceptively simple yet sophisticated. Perhaps there is a fraction more luck from the dice than is desirable, but it's not impossible to overcome.

A fun, portable battle game that plays quickly and is relatively simple, but also has enough rules to be a wee bit fiddly. And that's okay, as it doesn't mean it's difficult to learn, simply that there's enough depth that initially one will probably have to play a few times to get all the rules down. 

In places in the rulebook the language is not specific enough, something that its evidenced by the number of rules-related questions posted on BGG. I played this one (and its sister game "Macedonians vs. Persians") probably more than 15 times before I felt confident I was playing it correctly, which is odd for such a relatively simple game. Also, the translation for portions of the quick-reference cards is very poorly done: for example, some Celtic units have a special ability that is listed only on the Roman card. 

All that aside, this game seems almost infinitely expandable. Probably best as something to slip into one's pocket (hence the name) while going on a trip, to scratch the game-play itch. Also, it's a great, quick lunchtime game. And, the animated art on the thick, glossy cardboard tiles is quite attractive. 

Purchased for my birthday, May 2010. Also bought "Pocket Battles: Macedonians vs. Persians", July 2012. Basically the same game, so, same rating (too bad they didn't come out with these four armies all together originally, but hopefully they'll keep adding to it). [Note: As of 2014, there are 4 sets, including Elves vs. Orcs and Confederacy vs. Union.]

It's a mini-deck builder but with tiles instead of cards. Once your units are selected, array them across the left, front and right sections in the battlefield. Display all and then take turns charging forward and whacking whatever your opponent has placed in the matching section. You get a free move each turn to shuttle stuff around between sections. The combat is quick and easy - roll the dice and if the result matches what's shown on one or more of your tiles, it generates a hit (or hits) which the defender allocates. Units die quickly as they only have 1 or 2 life, so getting first hits in and rolling well is paramount. There's tactical stuff you can do with what gets grouped and keeping single units around - big groups generate lots of kills, small units can be thrown in front of groups to defend them getting whittled from opponent's big groups. There's a few special trait powers to wrap your head around as well which produces some decisions. There's ranged shots and melee shots for a few more decisions. It's not my favourite genre, deck-building, so I wasn't really into it. And I'm sure the tactical maneuvering makes some difference, but geez, rolling well when it counts helps your chances of winning (first to whack half your opponent's army). It was interesting enough to explore, but I didn't feel the tension or the drama - it just seemed like a lay-down smack-fest, with not a lot at stake because of the abstracted playing area. As such, I couldn't invest in the game-play.

Really liked this game. It's great fun to play. I love that you van set up an army customised by yourself and that once you have your army, you can play it in around 10-15 minutes. 

Set-up time is really what takes longest but it's also good fun to set it up. Hope to add a few more sets to this collection.

What wonderful little breath of fresh air this series is! I can easily see myself getting everything they put out (and not having to break the bank to do it!). And I knew nothing about the Pocket Battles series 3 weeks ago.

It's like a card battle game but with counters (which I prefer). It's a very accessible game system that still gives you a valid (if somewhat simplified) battle experience. The asymmetrical armies play very differently without a lot of special rules to accomplish this. It sets up & plays so quickly you can get in several games in a session, and you will want to. Grognards, however, need not apply. Unless you are willing to leave your range attenuation tables, etc., at the door and just have a little fun.

I prefer [b]Orcs vs. Elves[/b], but [b]Celts vs. Romans[/b] is definitely a better intro to the series, as well as being an excellent game in it's own right. Great Job!

Fun~!

Building your army is really half the game, and actually part I enjoy quite a bit. The skirmishing phase is brisk, and plays well, though muddling through the iconography kind of sucks the first handful of times.

Travels well, and another good "set up and throw down quicklike" game.

This game fills the niche of providing you with a war-themed experience on the go. The rules are not trivial (e.g. this beats Risk and other games), and the special unit powers add some interesting stuff into the mix. I think on my first play I got the wound rules wrong, but they are interesting and make sense. I don't think this will see a lot of play, but I can see how it will work well as a travel game.

One of the hardest rulebooks I've ever tried to follow. It all seemed simple at first until... what, huh, but, argh!

Tried to like the game but never got past the rulebook. Would like to have another stab at it one day because the selecting of armies and idea of a quick little battle game that's portable is quite appealing.
--------------------------
Five years after first trying to give this one a decent shake and I finally got multiple games with the most recent edition of the rules. All in all it's a decent little travel game, so long as you're prepared to make a few common sense rules interpretations along the way. Once you get the hang of it there's about a five minute set up time, selecting your army, then fifteen minutes of manoeuvring and dice chucking. We were decidedly unimpressed at first, but from the second game on a few nuances appeared that made it rise above pure dice chucker. Just. It's not deep. There's loads of luck. But to be honest it is rather fun assembling different unit combinations and trying different strategies out over twenty minutes. For a cheap little portable game, with a theme I have an interest in, I'm not disappointed in it... beyond the head shaking that after all these years the rules are still dreadful.

Not really like any other battle game out there.  It's a bit luck heavy, but even the die rolling system is unique.  The army building takes longer than playing out the battle, but then that is where most of the strategy is.  Very clean, very expandable, very fun!

RATING: 5
I have less experience with this set than I do with Orcs vs. Elves. The Romans are pretty good at making strong units, but generally lack mobility. 

The Celts are far more mobile, but tend to be more vulnerable as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The components are very cute, but the gameplay doesn't particularly feel like ancient warfare.  Armies disintegrate almost instantly, and the divisions of the battlefield into sectors doesn't end up feeling as important as it does in other games.  I bought the game to play with my afterschool kids, but after a few solo runs I haven't really felt compelled to do so.  Too light for my tastes.

I like how fast this plays and the fact that it allows for army building.  I do think the rules are a little ambiguous though.

RATING: 8
nice little game, quite depending on dice luck - one or two bad rolls (depending on game size) throws you out of the game. But with about 30 minutes per game (faster if you stick to your force and change only slightly between games) you can easily go thru 3 or 4 games on an evening and still play something else.
You are tempted to play bigger battles (130+) but you will need 2 sets then and you need to clear some rules/limit some units (obviously the game was not meant to be played with 2+ sets of tiles).
If you want to get serious with the game you might want to add some house rules to give the units some staying potential (simultaneous damage rolls for attacker and defender on interception for one, defender allowed to parry instead of striking, stand-and-shoot for missile troops with 2dice... stuff like that).

An outstanding game system, hitting a sweetspot in the balance between playability and detail. Rating down one notch for two reasons: 1) it could feel more accurate and "historical" than what it does (did the Romans ever beat up those Celts thanks to their heavily armored cavalry??); 2) I cannot be sure yet, but balance may be a problem...if it isn't, then certainly the Celtic player has a steeper learning curve.

Миниатюрная, красивая карточная игра с кубиками и жетонами :). Очень понравилось как оформление, так и сама игра. В процессе игры получается интересная баталия двух сил: кельтов и римлян, чьи отряды представлены плотными маленькими карточками-тайлами. Минусы заключаются в неоднозначных правилах, впрочем это решается просмотром соответствующих веток на Гике/форумах и т.д., а также готовится к выпуску новая редакция правил. 5 баллов от меня (немного завысил за компактность :)).

This game is a blast.

This game is addictive.

You're warned.

After a few game sessions, it has quickly become my #1 favourite game.

How simple, and yet deep and fun !

In fact, maybe we're getting close to the "perfect wargame" with this one, and maybe simply the "perfect game".

Such amazing mechanisms concentrated in a few elements, that hold in your pocket !

The Pros :

- amazing artwork : the design is beautiful and clean, the components are sturdy and very appealing
- NO BOARD NEEDED ! You are in desperate urge of playing ? Just pick up the box out of your pocket and play. Wherever. Whenever. It's become my favourite companion during long train trips, or during holidays ; juste a few square inches of smooth surface, and you're done. Clever.
- it captures the essence of wargaming with an economy of means which is simply overwhelming ; no hexes, no counters, no CRT... and yet you have everything : the art of placing and arranging your troops, artillery/mounted troops/infantry with their own advantages and habilities, but more : you have light/heavy cavalry, fast shooting artillery, powerful but slow heavy artillery... Simple rules reward "realistic" behaviours, such as keeping units on your front line (!), not weakening your sides, etc.
- Smart game mechanics : the use of tokens as both orders and wounds is simply brilliant ; the arrangement of dice on each tile that allows for a clever way to imply strength and effectiveness, and limitless combinations...
- it's fast and tensed : when you have assimilated the rules and played a few games, its's quick, reactive and bloody ! No need to schedule a 4 hour session and have to leave your game half finished...
- it's for every age and level of interest in boardgames : from hardcore/seasoned wargamers (Yes ! I can testify) to newbies (my 8 year old son keeps wanting to play since its first game)
- each army balance of power and specific traits are so cleverly designed that you can match the PB sets ! So Celts vs. Orcs, Romans vs. Macedonians... And soon maybe, Confederates vs. Persians ?...(see below).

The Cons :

- The rules : they are short (good) and quite well organised, but very synthetic and sometimes confusing if you don't pay enough attention : EVERY WORD COUNTS, and every bit of information is given only one time ; so you must take great care in reading them ; if you have a look at the forums, you'll see that many users are in need of clarification, and that the authors released updates with subsequent games (last versions of rules are freely provided on ZMan Games site).
- it's fast : some found it a drawback ; the limited numbers of items of the table, and the nature of the engagements calls for quick, skirmish-like, battles ; but why then not combining TWO boxes or more for a "monster" battle ?!? :-)
- luck plays a part in the game : as far as I'm concerned, this is not a problem, indeed I like the uncertainty behind it : this is consubstantial to warfare ; after all, if there would be any certainty in a given battle plan considering all parameters, no one would ever fight ! But this luck factor is very well balanced in my opinion and kept within reasonable borders
- WE WANT MORE ! Other games in the series were annouced, but the publishing process has kept a very slow pace. Great idea to venture into the fantasy world (Elves and Orcs), but we keep waiting for the ACW versions (will it be ever printed ? ;-( ).

SO, all in all, a very good surprise (I was quite skeptical at first),a GREAT little game, that you want to actually PLAY ever and ever.

Even though the rulebook makes this game feel pretty complicated, gameplay is actually quite streamlined and everything came together nicely on my first play. Played it with my 8 year old son, who really liked it! Half of the fun is in the assembly of your force, and consequently the setup of the game may take as much (or rather as little) time as the actual game. The dice make the game pretty luck dependent, but that is OK considering its short playing time. Especially with a 100 point army, the game still provides ample opportunity for tactical maneouvring. Love the variation in the different units.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pocket Battles is a fun little wargame, but I find that many of my friends don't like to spend time building their armies, so I think I should make some preconstructed army lists for various point totals.

This is a game that is easy to play solo as well, so it can be fun to play a quick game or three by yourself.

The Romans are very vanilla, but easy to play and still fun. The Celts have the potential to be very dangerous, especially with the Gaesetae, but a good opponent will weaken or kill those units before they can grow too strong.

Not yet played. There are a lot of interesting ideas here, but there's also an awful lot of metagame going on for a relatively light filler - having to build units and position them is a major barrier to getting this to the table. I wish that they would have included a couple of pre-made scenarios for beginning players to get a feel for it.

Update - played. This is almost entirely a game of alpha strikes. I would have to house rule this to enjoy it... maybe give units extra health...

Захотелось чего-то простого про битвы. Неурошима напрягает.

---

Вобщем пока не сильно впечатлен. Конечно она быстрая и компактная. Сбор армии и расстановка возможно чем-то интересны (неуверен из-за особенностей боевки), но вот сама битва очень специфична. Основная проблема - она совсем не похожа на реальную битву. Когда я посылаю в бой отряд, то противник фактически выбирает кого принести в жертву - в игре нет никакой разницы в защите например между преторианцами и ополчением. Затем он посылает отряд в атаку и жертву выбираю я. В этом есть какая-то тактика, но она несколько странная. Также не уверен, что интересно играть до разгрома половины армии.

Я подумываю добавить несколько хоумрулов.

1. После расстановки игроки должны назвать отряд знаменосец, потеря которого завершает битву. Хотя наверное победителя можно определять и по потерям на момент завершения битвы. Тоесть можно потерять скажем императора, но битву по потерям выиграть. Или можно в такой ситуации давать ничью (1:1).

1.1. Возможно отряд-знаменосец должен получить свойство Slow, чтобы нельзя было за просто так перемещать его прочь от опасности.

2. Если в ответ на атаку игрок объявляет перехват, то его отряд также получает бонус за charge (т.е. атакующий не имеет преимущества).

3. В рукопашной обе стороны кидают кубики и убирают потери одновременно (т.е. атакующий не имеет преимущества).

A war game that fits in the pocket!

When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!
\13\\13\
Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.
\13\\13\
Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.
\13\\13\
Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.
\13\\13\
Celts vs. Romans is the first in the Ancients line and also the first in the Pocket Battle series. Each Pocket Battles game will feature two armies from a particular era or genre (yes, fantasy and sci-fi, we are looking at you).

I already wrote a short review of the ElvesVSOrcs version of these games - so really, just read that.
Now I have 3 different Pocket Battles, and they are all fun.  The strategy and tactics become very apparent after a few games.  They are so deceptively simple, yet quite well balanced.  I've been wiped out due to stupidity and bad luck.  But the more I play, the more it is poor choices that are my downfall.  And, while the outcome of a game can come down to the roll of one dice, it never feels like you were cheated from victory.  It always feels, when such a roll determines the outcome, like you and your opponent have done your very best to mitigated each others fortune to the best of your ability.
Can't wait to mix and mach armies.  I really hope the reprints I have indicate a likelihood of more Pocket Battle modules.  Maybe more Fantasy ones, or sci-fy maybe?

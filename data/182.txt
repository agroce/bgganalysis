RATING: 6.5
Like [i]Poison,[/i] this is a game with very simple rules but more challenging than what it appears at first glance. 

I have not played with three or with partners, but it is likely that the three player game would change the game quite a bit, and the partners game would make it much more challenging.

RATING: 8.85
Another themeless gem from the good doctor! Far, FAR better with three players than either two or four. Battle-Line feels like it was the prototype for Knights of Charlemagne by comparison; and KoC is definitely the superior game.

UPDATE: My rating has soared from 8 to 8.85! But I repeat: this is for the three-player game ONLY.

RATING: 6
A game for those who find Schotten Totten/Battleline and Lost Cities too complex.  With two players this game is pretty dull and I had written it off until I read Tom Vasel's opinion that it's far better with three.  Indeed it is.  Gone is the near certainty in the end game that if you don't hold a card then a particular opponent does.  With less perfect information the game becomes more interesting.  Still not great, but I've raised my rating a notch.
    
I owned the Knights of Charlemagne edition.  The tiles are nice and chunky and the card quality is very good, though the artwork is uninspired.

Feels a little like lost cities.  Quick fun game for two.  Played with 3 and 4 now and find the game to be exceptionally versatile.  2, 3, and 4 all worked really well. 4 players in teams of 2 in my opinion is the best.  For a light card game this is excellent.  Upping my rating to 7.5 from 7.

A Knizia for $10? How could I pass that up? ...and it turns out to be quite a fine game, a quick little two-player card-laying game with enough going on to keep it engaging. A little bit like Knizia's other card games, but not too much so. Gorgeous artwork. A keeper.

A similar game to Lost Cities that plays best with 3 players. Can play 4 with partners. Not as agonizing as LC. Classic mathmatical Knizia.

Good for exactly 3 players. Otherwise, don't bother, just go with Lost Cities, BattleLine, or Keltis. I think this a typical Knizia, in that there is a depth to it that is belied by the simple rules, but this is pretty old now and I think he has done stuff that is just better more recently.

The idea of a three player game in the style of Schotten Totten or Lost Cities sounded great to me. However, the reality was it felt more like a bash the leader game and manipulating player A into thinking that player B was doing better that you so that they would fight them and not you.

This is a very simple but engaging game.  There are only a few rules, but decisions are tense.  We play 2-player.  If you love Lost Cities and Battle Line, like we do, this should suit you as well.  Although they share a similar flavor, we find them different and enjoyable enough to own them all.

I've only played as a 2p game. I think it sounds a lot more interesting with 3 or even with the 2p teams (in a 4p game). I'd like to get more playings in to decide.

There really is no theme, although the card art is great in the Playroom version of this game. Its like a simpler Battle Line, but it plays fast enough that its worthwhile as a filler. For a 2p game, I don't see much reason to play repeat times, but with more I think it could get more interesting.

RATING: 4
Production: (Knights of Charlemagne edition) Nice linen finish cards with easily recognizable colors.  The tiles are overproduced (tokens or cards would have been sufficient); I would have preferred symbols to numbers on the cards (numbers connote strength to me, or some sort of hierarchical relationship between the cards that doesn't actual exist in this game); and the theme is a throw-away.  Play: From reading the rules I wasn't expecting much, and for the most part it didn't deliver much either.  The first two-thirds of the game was mindless playing; only when the deck was exhausted could I begin to deduce what cards my opponent held, making for a few interesting decisions about where to place my remaining cards. (2 0 2) (1 play)

Sort of a simplified Battle Line, I enjoy Knights of Charlemagne for it's extreme simplicity and fast play.  It also works with three and four which is nice.  The mechanics are incredibly simple but it works well and you'll have more challenging decisions to make that you might initially think.  I've found this to be extremely spouse-friendly.

Knizia could have created this game in his sleep. Certain cards must be played on certain columns. Sound familiar? Here, the "column A or column B" dilemma is not nearly as pressing as, say, the "play or wait" dilemma in Lost Cities, but the decisions still are not simple. It's remarkable that Knizia can produce so many similar interesting games.

RATING: 8
The best thing about this game is that it can be played with 2,3,4... OR 6 PLAYERS!! (in this situation, you'll play only with your hand of 8 cards).. but it can't be played with 5 players in any way. 
Update: Anyways, i believe that's a small bonus an after testing it, although it's a bit chaotic, it can compensates with the non random hand, so you have to plan accordingly from the beginning. so, the Rating goes up, to 8.

The rules for this one are dead simple, even for a Knizia game.  However, when I played it, I was amazed at how tense and strategic it is.  It feels a little like Lost Cities, except that rather than wanting desparately to not have to play a card, here you want to play each card two places.  You also feel less like you need to draw certain cards - any hand is a good one (while in Lost Cities, every hand stinks).  It is great with 3 players!

Simple rules and plays really fast! Not as good as Battle Line or Lost Cities but what does that really mean? Not much. If you take KoC as more of a kids' game, then there isn't much to quibble (the box does say Age 8+).

RATING: 6.8
A curious re-working of Lost Cities, with three players, one will come out badly. Players A and B don't compete, each fighting Player C who finishes the game with only single points. Not fun. Play as a 2 player or a partnership game. Other than that, nice stuff but again, Playroom over-produce the game. Nice graphics, but a very empty box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game where a person can brain freeze by continually adding up & noting which cards have been played, which cards can yet to be turned over, and where your opponent is most likely to play them.  This constant evaluation gets redundant.  I like a game where I need to adapt to different strategies during the game--not the same one over & over.  

I find it interesting that the value of the cards is not important for scoring a location--the number of cards is.  The value or color is important for placing, but also  for keeping track of what your opponent has played & what might be turned over on your side.

Too much luck involved with what is dealt.  The person who dealt the most cards for the highest valued locations wins.

Players dispatch their knights to ten different locations, attempting to exert the most influence strategically.

I guess you could say this is my "Lost Cities."  Its rating is slowly inching up.  Quite mindless for the first 2/3 of the game, but it's fun, quick, and just strategic enough to make the end interesting.

One of my favorite games; easy rules  & easy scoring. Have mostly played two-player which is great (I can't remember how the 3-player game worked out - it was a long time ago). Since two randomly chosen cards are removed from the deck prior to play, the advantage of card counting is diminished. Seems to become more challenging the more times we play. Have Tabula Rasa edition.

RATING: 8
This is the 3rd game in Knizia's trilogy (along with Lost Cities and Schotten Totten.)  It's underrated and often overshadowed by the other two games, probably because it's virtues are not as immediately obvious.  It's basically a game about trying to play your cards carefully so as not to reveal your strategy.  However, it has a 2 player version, a 3 player version, and a 4 player version, each of which is very good but a little different.

RATING: 7.368
Happy to play on the iPhone but more likely to play Lost Cities or Battleline in real life - that said, yet to do three player version where it apparently shines, so an optimistic 7 (9/1/10). UPDATE: Final played as three player, and It's even better than two player, so a good solid 7 rating (13/1/12).  UPDATE: Essentially now gets passed over by other games, but It's main redeeming feature is the ability to play a Lost Cities type game with 3 players; this is the reason for keeping and It's ranking (still 7) (29/1/14). UPDATE Not played for a while, but still good memories as a three player game (Rating 7.368 Jan 17)

RATING: 7
Knights of Charlemagne is a light Knizia card game in the vein of Battle Line.  It is super easy to play (much more so than BL), but there is some delightful tension here, especially by the endgame.  I've only tried with two players, but I hear it shines with three and I can see why.  Perhaps KoC has been overshadowed in the 20 years since it was first released, but it is still rather under-rated.  A very good filler for 3 or 2 and one that works well for all ages.

The game itself has a BattleLine tug of war feeling, although this game is much lighter.  What sets this game apart is the ability to play with partners.  As a two player, the game is light and is a solid '6'.  I predict the rating will go up when this is played as a four player game.  On the whole, I am pretty pleased with this one.

So, I picked this up for $1 at the B&N thing.  (I picked up a second copy for a friend).  I read the rules.  Nice and simple rules.  My normal stance is, if it says ages 8 , assume it's a kids game and judge it that way.  Well, I read the rules and thought this game S^<&S.  I brought it to work and told the person I bought it for, not to open it.  To keep it sealed for trade fodder (Someone is going to want it).  But I had already opened my and read the rules, so I cleared off a space and played it. 

Surprise, surprise it wasn't that bad.  The beginning of the game is just tit for tat.  But, 2/3rds of the way through each hand it becomes a bit tense (and you realise 'oh I wish I hadn't played that already).  It plays very quick.  So, for a two player game in under 20 minutes, I'd say it doesn't S^<&.  I'm not sure I like the 'team' play of 4 people, so will probably stick to 2-3 players.

Well worth the $1, probably worth more (not sure about full price).

First played July 12th, 2007.  You can be taught by someone in less that 5 minutes and it's a quick play (<30min as a 2 player).  I enjoyed it, however the luck/strategy scale seemed to dip towards the luck side in what you draw, however there is a fair amount of strategy as well that wasn't apparent at the start.  It's a great filler as a two player game.  It will be interesting to play with 3 and 4 to see how those play out.  You work for victory points by playing cards down to one better the other in each column.  Adding all the victory points up and seeing who won.  I'd recommend this as a filler at this point and don't see why it wouldn't be a good game at 3 or 4 either.  See if you can borrow a copy or play with someone who has it to see if it's right for you.

Knights of Charlemagne is a game reminiscent of Schotten Totten/Battle Line but not quite as tense.  Whereas Battle Line contains tense decisions on most turns, the real decisions don't seem to start here until most of the deck is drawn and played.  Early plays don't seem to lock you in near as tightly as those in Battle Line or Lost Cities and seem relatively unimportant.  (Or I may just be missing their importance)

The components from Playroom are top notch, but like last year's "Poison" seem a little overdone to justify a bigger box & price.

It's nice that this game plays well with three.  I can definitely understand all the Schotten Totten/Lost Cities comparisons, though it feels different enough from those two.  If players think too long about placement, it can definitely suck the fun out of the game, which should play very light and quick.  With 2, I would definitely pick Lost Cities or Schotten Totten/Battle Line, and with 3 I'd probably prefer other Knizias like Loot or Ivanhoe, but this could be fun every once in a while.

This is a very simplistic game with just a hint of strategy. Its almost too simple and though it can be fun tends to get old. I found after a couple of plays I was growing tired. This would be great for beginner board gamers or for older children though.

Described as a Lost Cities for 3 players (or 2 teams of 2).
Battlelines and Lost Cities seem to be superior games when compared to KoC played as a 2 player game. Where KoC shines is as a 3 player game (esp. since coming in 2nd place actually collects points over someone coming in 3rd).

First play of this was fun - very quick, good for 2 or 4 (don't know about 3 yet), enough strategy to be interesting, essentially no learning curve, and a modest luck element. I want to try this next with kids, should be good for about 8 year old. [Update: Kids like it a fair amount. Even the youngest easily gets the rules and does fine, which is a big plus. Works just fine with 3)

2-4p, 30m.  Knizia card game somewhere in between Lost Cities and Shotten-Totten.  Tom Vasel emphasizes it is best with three players.

Bought reprint January 2006 at Aero Hobbies.

RATING: 7
A decent filler game that takes about a minute to teach but does force very hard decisions on the players.  It works well with two, but three players is where the game shines.  

My only main concern about the game is it is a game that is heavily reliant on card counting but it is still enjoyable nonetheless.  I would only suggest this game if you can get very cheap though (no more than $10).  It's not as meaty as other filler games like Melee or Formula Motor Racing.

01/07/07 Played a three player game, once. Extremely weak theme. Very little strategy. A poor cousin to Lost Cities and Battle Line. Its only advantage is it can be played by 2 to 4.

RATING: 7.5
The components in "Knights of Charlemagne" include beautifully drawn and laminated cards and tiles. The game is easy to teach and play. As others have noted, it's a very good game for 3 people. I'd usually be willing to play this, but I doubt I'd stay interested in playing more than a few times in a row. But it has all the tenets of a Reiner Knizia "warmup-level" game: simple rules (3 pages in large type, with illustrations), many choices to make that are mathematical in essence, a theme pretty much tacked on, playing to the end to decide a winner while not eliminating anyone from contention. Plenty of strategy decisions, especially for a game this short. One good suggestion in the rules: 'play as many rounds as there are players'--to which I would add, 'play at least 3 rounds and total the scores to decide a winner.' Although game play is fairly abstract, the beautiful artwork helps to infuse some feeling of theme.

A sister game to Lost Cities and Schotten Totten / Battleline. More similar to ST, in that you're continually counting towards the end what's been played, what's missing, what's safe and what not, trying to determine how best to lay out the cards you have left. Which slows the game down, and loses the pacy nature that LC provides. But playable with 3, which is why I got it originally, though it's now traded away.

Very impressive for 1995.  Still a solid game in today's environment.  As with so many of Knizia's games, it contains much more depths and much less randomness that one suspects at first.

I'm not a fan of the card counting -- even with 2 cards removed at random, you need to do some boring math to figure out what cards your opponent probably has in hand.

Tabula Rasa is Lost Cities for people who like to take the fun out of everything.  I find it significantly easier than Schotten Totten, if only because there are fewer choices.  But, it's more tactical and unforgiving than Lost Cities.  A nice middle ground between the two.  I've only played it with two, though I would someday like to try it with more.  Interesting scoring possiblities with the treasures and the bonus tile.

This plays really fast! The box says 30 minutes but my wife and I play in about 10 (maybe that speaks to why I play so poorly).

EDIT: I've heard it only really shines with three, so I'll have to try that soon.

Not a bad card game.  Basically, you're playing to match by either rank or suit and have more than your opponent.  The bits are very good, as each tile is solid, pretty thick, and well decorated.

Not a bad little game! Feels like Battle Line, but with less tension, and Richelieu, but where it seems a little harder to figure out which way each item will go?

I hope the iPhone will upgrade to support 3 players, which is apparently the best way to play this game!

--- Summary ---
The deck has 5 colors, 10 cards each, cards numbered 1-5 (2 each). 2 cards are randomly removed from the game, then the rest of the cards are split into 2 draw decks (1/player). Each player draws a hand of 8 (?) cards. The center has a line of 5 castles numbered 1-5 (in order), then 5 castles (1 each color). Players alternate turns. On your turn, play a card then draw a card. When playing, play to your side of the line in the center, either to the matching numbered castle or the matching colored castle.

The game ends when all cards in decks and hands have been played. Then evaluate the line of castles from left to right (1-->5, then the others). Whichever player has more cards played wins the castle (worth face value VP); if tied, both players win 1VP instead. The first player to win 2 castles gets 5VP bonus. Each of the 5 colored castles are worth 5VP. The player with the most VP wins!
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite similar to Schotten Totten, especially in the sense that you want to hold off on showing your key cards as long as possible.  A good game on its own, but doesn't have the same amount of tension and difficult choices as Schotten, although it does have both of these characteristics.  Then again, most games can't rise to such a high level!

After playing this with my students at school, I've decided I like this game, especially the partnership game. It can be laid out, explained and played in about 15 minutes. Plays really well with four-player partnership, or with three with every man for himself. I think with two I'd go with the similar Lost Cities. Rating has gone up to the point where it's now off my trade pile, and has earned a permanent place in my game cabinet at school. I have even acquired a copy for home!

RATING: 7.5
Another Lost Cities type game, but one that never made it to the US before now.

Each card can only be played two ways, so the options might seem a little more constrained than Lost Cities, but in reality, there are more spaces to play on and each card has to be considered when making a choice.  Unlike Lost Cities, your hand doesn't get as clogged up with cards that you don't want to play, so the the end result is that the game feels less constrained and less tense.  There really isn't any math to the game, but I still found my choices interesting.  Sometimes I avoid Lost Cities due to all the addition and subtraction, so despite having a lower rating, this will be a very easy filler game to pick up and play in almost any mood.

I wonder how the game is with a 3rd player and as a 4 player partnership game?  Could be interesting.

A stripped down Battle Line, great when you need a quicker, simpler game.

Pretty interesting with some tough decisions.  Played with 3 - I don't intend to even try it with 2 or 4 as I suspect it'd be far worse.

A fun light filler Knizia card game.  It has some interesting mechanics in the scoring which make it interesting enough to be worth repeat playing.

I think we like the slight variation where the numbers you play below the city tiles matter. There is a greater chance of being screwed by a bad hand but it adds more depth to the game.

First play 4 players. Partnership game and accoridng to the rules you can't table talk. You have to hope your partner is able to assist your plays and vice-versa. The game is etremenly similar to Battleline. After reading a review on it I think this game would play better with 3 players. It was a *QUICK* filler game and one I'd like to try again. The final score of our game was 26-25. We win!

This is basically the idea from battle line, and has basically the same tensions, although I don't know that I like this mechanic for a multi-player game as much, at least not how it is implemented here. And with 2 players well just play battle line, which is cleaner and more tense.

Knizia manages to take the same idea behind Lost Cities and Schotten Totten and create something else out of it.  The mechanics are fine (the cards must be played to either its matching number or color, and deciding when to do which is where the tension comes from), but it suffers from the same problem ST has -- that the first few cards played are played randomly, and the strategy doesn't develop until about halfway through the game.  There are some good tensions here, though.

Fairly simple game with a bit of luck and hard decisions after the game's mid-point.  Played it three-players only.

This is Tabula Rasa.  A Schotten Totten/Batteline game by Knizia recently re-released as Knights of Charlemagne. Still a good game with tough decisions on where to build up your forces.

A fine game for what it is - a 2-4 person, 20 minute filler.  It feels a lot like Schotten Totten, but the mechanics are different.

Nice, simple, area majority card game. Best with 3 players (the 2 player game is pretty dull, haven't tried 4 player yet).

This works well as a family game.

RATING: 7.5
Plays very fast.  At first it seems like a silly exercise.  You just lay cards down until the cards are all laid down.  It is ultimately rather interesting and thoughtful for such a quick game.  If played with four, two on two, it takes on another interesting character as you try to cooperate without knowing what your teammate is working with.  I like it.

As far as my 8 year old son is concerned, this is the best game EVER.  Fast, attractive, and easy to teach, this game requires some thought and decision making.  Plus, this should serve as an excellent kid tutorial for Battleline!  WARNING-the colors used on the cards cannot be distinguished by my colorblind buddy Kevin, the game is entirely unplayable by him.  We offered to mark the cards, but he said that he would rather just play Spy instead.

I was expecting to find this dull as moat-water. How wrong I was! Each game has been truly great! Everyone seems to thoroughly enjoy what it does.

I compare [i]Knights[/i] to [i]Battle Line[/i], and I throw my top hat into the ring, declaring that it is a better game. It truly is. The strategies involved, the goals, the tension, and the brinkmanship, are very similar. Why [i]Knights[/i] knocks [i]BL[/i] of its horse is three-fold: it's easier to play rules-wise with the family; it's more FUN; and it scales upwards to 4 players.

The reviews have been lukewarm for this (they say 3-player is best), but I think it deserves much more attention.

The strategies involved are deep enough to keep gamers interested, and the rules shallow enough to keep non-gamers in the loop, such as my missus.

I am so glad I bought this baby on a whim.

I have played many games of this, 2- and 3-player, and 4-player as 2 teams, and they've all been a cartload of fun.

Seems that the consensus is this is best with three.  As a two-player game, Knights of Charlemagne felt like a variation of Lost Cities or Schotten Totten.  While not as complicated or strategic as the latter, you are still often faced with the difficult choice of whether to play a card as the color or the value.  Although I've largely settled on always contesting the 2-3-4 of the black tiles, most of it still came down to the draw.  A decent filler that I would not mind going back to occasionally.

Quick, but suspenseful.  This game is definitely a descendent of Schotten-Totten (and thus Battle Line).  With three players, it is quite enjoyable!  The Playroom/Knizia track record for satisfying quick games is quite good in my book.

A very simple card game of colors and numbers. It is more of a relaxing activity until the last few cards, when it becomes tense and tactical. So, if you enjoy card games with lots of tough choices, this probably isn't it. This is much more casual than that.

Owned on ipod. Once again I am left disappointed by Knizia. This game is very simple card play with almost no theme and boring interactions. I feel that there is little reason to revisit the game.

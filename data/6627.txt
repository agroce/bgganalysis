RATING: 7
Honestly, it's a game that is fun and if you like amusement parks, a nicely implemented theme. Card art is fun (on the silly side). There's some layers of strategy and keeping up with the Jones going on here. My gaming friends have enjoyed it quite a bit.

Some of the action point rules are a little obtuse, but I dig the way the pieces work together.  Having played the derivative [b]Restaurant Row[/b] first, [b]Scream[/b] seems to have most of the fun in less than half the time.  I'll have to see which one I pick up first.  I'm also torn on the graphic design on this game: a little distracting, but still good-looking.

Sorry but I find the layout and pictures confusing, and the game not so much fun for my tastes. I only played it once in 5 people, but in the last turns it has been really hard to make enough points to gain a position - actually nobody managed to do that, so the situation was utterly decided at half of the game. As far as our personal tastes are concerned, we found that reshuffling customers every time somehow vanified long term strategies... Hm.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly nice game.  Plays much better with the clarified rules.  Need to play it more to get a better feel of the game, but as it stands now, it is quaint.  I have only played it with 3 people but I hear that with more players the mechanics of the game changes.  Will report more with further game play and examination.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light and lucky, yet still having meaningful decisions.  That's a neat trick to pull off, and this one does it.  The global vs. local competition is what elevates this clean little system.  I must say, however, that while the cardstock is top notch, I'm dissapointed by the pastel color scheme.  That, and the rather busy (but nice looking) art, make it tough sometimes to glance around the table and *quickly* evalute the situation.  Still, a minor quibble that may fade after repeated play.

Nem rossz vidámparkos játék, érdekes hogy egyrészt vannak mindenki által elérhető potenciális látogatók, másrészt a szomszédos vidámparkok egymással is versengenek bizonyos emberek becsábításáért (Ez utóbbi kicsit a 7 wonders harcos részére emlékeztetett). Ami gond: elég sok a holtidő, rosszak a színek (a piros szinte összes árnyalata megtalálható a 7 féle létesítmény-szín közt), de összességében a rendszere tetszik. Partijátékra számítottam, de nem az.

One of the best family friendly games I know of.  Why this isn't rated higher comes as a surprise to me.

A very cute game with excellent artwork.   Player interaction is limited, and no direct conflict, but the options to maximize customers are engaging.

Finally, this game is wonderfully inexpensive.

A very light filler game ideal for the family.  Cards are very colorful and cartoony that naturally fits the theme.

RATING: 5
Good stuff for my friends & family that like amusement parks.  Complexity level is just right.  Non-gamers should pick up on the game after the first couple of rounds, and there's enough going on for gamers who can tolerate luck.  MINOR COMPLAINTS: The customer card deck is too small (resulting in reshuffling almost every round), and two color cubes should be provided for each player (the single set means that it's harder to keep track of who is doing well).

UPDATE 2014:  My opinion of this game has fallen considerably, especially when played with 5-6 players, where the randomness of the customers and available rides is intensified.

Fantastic theme, great artwork, but... could do with a little more variety in rides available. Mechanically fun, though. I do like the manner in which customers are distributed - a general pool alongside a local selection between every pair of players.

Its a well-themed filler. Easy to teach, quick to play...and the game works for what it is.

RATING: 6
Cute, fairly light game that is mainly a set collection game where one needs to have the right sets at the right time. The game throws in several curves in that it is often difficult to know what customers are going to come up when, if ever, and how valuable certain specializations are going to be. The way the game is designed most of the decisions are tactical, because one does not have any look-ahead, and the number of things that one can do on a given round is so limited. I still quite enjoy the title though because it plays quite quickly, and manages to offer several excruciating tactical choices per outing, which makes it interesting to me. I love the theme too.

Good 3-4 player filler, goes quick.  Drags with 6 players.  

I especially like the public vs. local customers and the two competitions you are in for the different customers.

Played this one many times while repping the JRG booth at Spiel '03 - a solid, fun, lighter game that is easy to learn and well balanced.  Several players suggested a 'house rule' of spending action points to sabotage another player's rides but it was not actually tried.

RATING: 6
Decent card game where you try to match your "attraction" cards with the "customer" cards to your left & right   the public middle.  Whoever has the highest sum'ed value of the "attraction" cards gets the corresponding "customer" cards which are worth 1vp apiece.  A few twists in that that you only compete for the customers on your left and right with the players to your left and right.  Also there is a cheapskate customer who always goes to the "least" developed theme park.  Not a bad game.  I want to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once with 6, and it was information overload to try to figure out where the customers were going to go.  Also felt a bit too random-- I won by a point mostly because three roller coaster fans showed up in the last draw, and I had another 5 coaster in my hand.  Sure, I had saved the card for such an event, but if the customer draw had been slightly different I would have lost.  I suspect that it will be less random with fewer people, even though there will be fewer turns to average out the luck, but I'm not entirely sure why.

Played 1 time. Lighter game but has some inetrestign things to it. The people I played it with liked it more than I did. I feel the advertising action is too powerful and that there should be more customer (local and national) per turn, and more face down locals in order to make research more worthwhile. Also a bit visually fiddly as you try and figure out what you have alead in. I think it will go smoother next playing. [gf-rcvClix]

This is a fun little card game, that's going to take a little more room, than your normal card games. It's a lot of fun to play and plays fairly quick. Making it a good filler game for the family or party crowd. You have plaenty of options available to you, but can only do so much, as you're limited to only 4 action points per turn. We had a lot of fun with this game and I'm looking forward to many more plays.

The national/local customer mechanism is pure genius - and the gameplay is thoughtful yet fun.

I like the concept of this game, trying to get people to your theme park. Original way of building up your theme park and the way you must influence the local and foreign visitors to actually come and visit your park.

RATING: 7
Pleasantly light game with plenty of luck, but also a good dose of meaningful decisionmaking.  A bit reminiscent of some other games including ZooSim, Freight Train, and Showmanager.  The clever touch that makes Scream Machine stand out is the competition for the "local" customers - players are competing individually against each of their neighbors as well as against the table as a whole.  I also like the novelty of the "cheapskate" customers, whose presence adds another layer of subtlety to the contest.

Silly psuedo-area control filler. Use different colored cards to attract different types of "customers" on the board.  Enjoyable with three, but I'd be very leery of playing with a large number of players because it's important to compare plateaus with the ones other players have. (1 play)

Just didn't do it for me.  Nothing special apart from a nice idea about differentiating between local/national customers.  The luck of which customers got drawn seemed to dominate with only a limited amount you could actually do to determine your fate.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  It was hard to envision how it would feel by reading the rules, though it seemed like it would be like a lighter version of Get the Goods.  It ended up being a little more random, a lot shorter, and a little more varied in feel.  I like the difference between competing over local vs. national customers, which felt like a novel mechanism.  The theme is pleasing and the artwork is playful.  This isn't something I'd want to play all the time, but as long as it moves quickly, it's a fun way to spend 20 - 30 minutes.

The family really likes it; the four of us can play quite quickly and with some laughs.
Not as good as O Zoo Le Mio, but good.

Based on one play; four-player game.  Fun card game; a different concept.  I liked this game and would possibly buy it.  The fact that it's different is a plus.

This MIGHT be a good game, but take game suffers because it is too short. For what is it now, it's just lucky fest where the winner is the luckiest guy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Unique twist in this card game is that you are competing for customers on both a local and a national scale for 5-7 different types of amusement park types of rides/eateries.  However, only the five national customers are shown face up and easily prepared for as the 2 local customers are facedown between to each player's right and left opponents.  This game really has too few actions even for a short card game and is made worse when people take a lot of time to think about optimizing their move when it needs to be played quickly.  This should only be a 15 minute game, not a 30  minute game.  As such, I might be rating my experience more than the game...

RATING: 7
Enjoyable little game, filling a lunch time quite pleasantly, without rushing.  Some random luck but as to be expected in a card game and the overall game is neat, with the combination of local and national customers requiring individual adjustment and some tricky decisions.  Can fall a bit flat when you cannot improve your situation in a turn, which can happen especially late in the game.  I would also add that the game as written can give odd little runs of luck such that an early investment on (say) coasters pays out more or less than it should, due to the customers being reshuffled every time, but I see that a 'balanced" version is proposed that should remedy that concern (6 rather than 5 national customers, the remainder laid out evenly as local customers).  Worth a try!

Interesting little set collection game with a fun theme, but nothing spectacular.  I like the local vs. international customers, as well as the face-down customers -- in a game with very little hidden information this helps to add some tension.  Action points are very tight, but there are several useful ways to spend them.  I think the rules could definitely be clearer on a few points, and the ride type icons could be bigger since you're often scanning the table to see who has what.  Overall, it's a good game, but there are several others that match the same profile I'd rather play.

With little houserules it's a nice filler: low-budget people go to the Theme Park with MORE 1-level (cheap) rides; and the winner is the first to reach 38 points (so you have time to develop your park).

Would be a 5 if the symbols were easier to read from across the table and the attraction cards had consistent colors that were easy to match up.  But it's too long and slow for me.

Amusement park card game. More like a set collection, try to get highest value in certain categories to beat out other players for points. Problem is, the categories you are competing for change from round to round so it's difficult to have much strategy.

RATING: 2.5
The classic example of pushing a game further than it merits. Scream Machine is ugly, mechanically unsound, artistically gormless and technically inadhesive. Perhaps worst of all, it attempts to squeeze a proper developmental strategy game into a 15-minute filler.

A complete mis-fire from both designer and publisher.

RATING: 5.5
A card-game that revolves around a bidding mechanism. Notionally the players are theme park operators, and they score points based on the number of visitors attracted to their park. There are different types of visitor, attracted to different types of ride. The highest value rides attract the most visitors. Some visitors are global (in the middle of the table) and all players compete for them. A few are local - each player competes with the two neighbouring players for these. The different rides are bought each round with a limited number of action points.
The art is terrific! I was impressed. The gameplay is interesting, but slow. Players really have to stop and think about their strengths in all the different ride categories before they select which ones to build each turn. There is little to do between turns, so AP is a danger. With careful play from all participants, the winner will be determined by the cards available on each player's turn. As an early advantage is likely to be retained, the luck factor lowers the game's rating.

RATING: 6
Ok with 3 players. It's a fun take on the majority genre, with a nice twist that you're in 3 separate competitions - one with the whole board and then with each player beside you. The pace is likely to get too slow with more than 4 players though. Repeat plays found luck was just too dominant for the number of actions / rounds there are.

RATING: 7
Amusement park theme, players compete to attract customers.  It is clever to have "national" customers that anyone can attract as well as "local" customers that only the two adjacent players compete for.

RATING: 6
In this game, you draft cards to try to get more of certain symbols than both your neighbors and all of your opponents.  There's really a lot of analysis here, because you constantly have to add up everyone's symbols to see if you can get ahead, which can slow the game down with a lot of players.

This card game was really in the collection as a substitute for players who find O Zoo Le Mio spacially challenging; fundamentally both games are about gaining majorities in different categories and scoring (differently) the customers attracted to each category. Sadly, O Zoo is winning the cupboard space as the majorities are handled better: it has at-a-glance comparison of meeples, whereas the values of the rides involves too much adding. (Even the clever & thematic catchup mechanic of the Cheapskate customers adds to the labour of who has the least valuable park). Being a card game, there is luck of the draw, which doesn't please some players, despite another novel catchup feature of "local" customers which can at times add to the chaos; O Zoo has the lookahead aspect which is interesting for most. Sadly, With Scream Machine again an action point menu (to over"ride" the card draws) proves to be a recipe for downtime and even with 3 players (the preferred # to develop the parks) it can be felt; O Zoo has simultaneous evaluation and almost instant placement. Scream Machine has the humour inherent in the card art, however O Zoo stays for providing a more tense experience with the uncertainty of bids made.

It seems to me that your score is almost entirely determined by how well the cards that are available when it's your turn match up to the cards that were dealt to the center and either side of you. I don't think the player has anywhere near enough control over the decisions for me to like this game much. It's ok as a quick 3-player filler, maybe, but not much else.

Got it as a game to get my then 6 year-old daughter into.  She enjoyed it and so he my 3 year-old boy.  They like the artwork on the cards a lot.  The theme really excites them.  My wife isn't so crazy about it.  I think she feels it moves a bit on the slow side (which it can).  Worth trying out, but I couldn't whole-heartedly recommend it to people.  Read the reviews and if you think you'd like it then you probably would.

I wouldn't mind trying this where in a four player game each player gets five action points per turn. I think there might be  little more control that way. With three players the four action points look just right. A pity that the fun card artwork interfers with the playing of the game - the next edition could do with larger symbols on the cards - you do get used to it by the second playing though.

RATING: 6.5
Some preliminary thoughts:

1) Why are the attraction/ride symbols on the visitors so small? Was something amiss during production or playtesting?

2) Is it just me or is the whole 1, 2, 3 action points for a 1, 3, 5 valued attraction respectively just plain confusing? Why not 1, 2, 3 action points for 1, 2, 3 values?

UPDATE:

Gameplay is smooth and easy enough to grasp. 4 action points is a nice number though a little bit more = agony, which would be good. Choices are often easy to identify though some are weak (tearing down rides, replacing face up rides).

There's a nice theme to the game but our group slowed down because of the comparative maths aspect (which relates to point 2 above) and the tiny symbols didn't help (see point 1).

Scores are often close with 3 players. I fear there is some downtime with any more than that.

A little too heavy for a filler, a little too light for a serious game. That is my main gripe with the game.

Vidámparkot menedzselünk. Többfajta játékot építhetünk és a véletlenszerűen felcsapott érdeklődőket megszerezve kapunk pontot. Érdekesség, hogy minden játékos közé is véletlenszerűen 2 látogatót felcsapunk, amikért csak ők ketten versengenek. A játék baja, hogy elég sokfajta akció van és könnyednek kinézősége ellenére elég sokat lehet rajta agyalni, hogy a 4 akciópontunkat mire költsük el. Kicsit nagy lehet emiatt a holtidő 6 játékosnál. A szerencse szerepe több helyen megjelenik, ezért elég magas. Az összhatás nem rossz, de emiatt a kettősség miatt több pontot nem ért első játékra.

Good light game, that feels like just playing the platforms in Die Macher.  There are certainly some random elements, and perhaps drawing one card is way too weak (draw two take one seems more worthwhile) especially in comparison to the power of advertising, but this is fun, clean design.

I purchased this on a whim when I suddenly realized how much I liked small card games.  The art really attracted me, as did the park building theme.  I'm a sucker for most world building games even if they *are* abstract.  The "national" versus "local" customers was an unexpected mechanics treat.  I'm not convinced that you have a whole lot of control over your destiny in this game, but I'm pretty sure my family will enjoy playing it every once and a while.

Collect majorities in the right kind of rides to win customers. Since customer cards are randomly drawn before each round and attraction cards are drafted, there’s only so much you can do to influence your fate. Requires you to keep an eye on what other payers have collected, yet the artwork doesn’t really help the various categories of attractions stand out across the table. Not bad.

Engaging gameplay.  The graphics are nice, but a little cluttered--wish the cards were a bit easier to read.  It would also be nice if each player had some visual reminder in front of them as to what color score marker they picked.  Minor quibbles aside, though, very fun.  I can definitely see playing this one often.

Scream Machine is a light,  multi-player card game that is the best thing since The Gravitron.

The artwork is exceptional and brings the theme park aura to the forefront.  It is a worthy entry in the card filler department with a perfect balance between luck and thoughtful decisions.  

For a game of this weight,  there is a lot of substance here and the theme makes it accessible to a wide range of ages.

I looked at Scream Machine at Origins because Terri has a thing for Roller Coasters, but I didn't get a chance to try it.  I looked into reviews of the game, and it sounded like a silly, light game, and those are a dime-a-dozen.  I had a chance to actually play it at DragonCon, and liked it more than I expected. There is a cheapskate mechanic that rewards concentrating on a small number of collections, rather than trying to get everything possible.  It's not exactly depth, but at least there is something to make the decisions interesting.

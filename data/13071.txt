A chaotic game with a lot of bluffing. The player with the strongest speaker action will rule the game. Very enjoyable in the right group.

The basic premise that you do not know whether you are hurting someone else or yourself is interesting. As the game progresses you gradually get to know which races are yours and of course you have to change the course of your actions while still trying to keep this in secret. This creates an extremely chaotic environment where it is absolutely impossible to tell who is winning. You can tell how you are faring but the rest is clouded.

But chaotic does not translate to pointless. Everything you do still serves a purpose, i.e., you are trying to maximise the swings to your favour. The only thing you cannot do, is to choose who gets smitten. It is like being in a dark room with a shotgun loaded with rock salt shells. Everyone gets their turn to shoot and others try to hold their voices down even if they get hit so that they do not attract more salt into their direction.

I can tell you that many players who like being in control at all times, will detest Age of Gods. However, I find it refreshing to play a highly interactive game without having to choose who to hit. There are so many other games that only balance themselves if everyone hits the leader, or if two players start quarreling they are guaranteed to lose.

Not exactly a wargame but an area manipulation game till those races that you control will ultimately survive and give you points like in most euro games. 

Euro games will use cubes with colors, this uses a fantasy theme. 

Reasonable game. But not war-ish enough for me. Nevertheless, a good gateway game for newbies that is converting from euro to wargame.

[i]Age of Gods[/i] [b]may[/b] be a fine game, if you are willing to play it more than once. Since the graphic design is rather poor, its unlikely you'll give it enough time to [i]discover[/i] whether it is worth the effort. (And of course, once you put the effort in, it may still be just completely average.)

With so many other good games out there, it is unlikely we'll learn if it is actually good...

What a great, criminally underrated game! Be forewarned however, this is mainly a game of bluffing (what races worship you and what other races are you backing at the end) and card management. At the beginning of the game, you are dealt almost all the cards you will be able to play for the duration of the game - you need to decide which ones to use for actions, which to use for betting, and which to use for other purposes (technology advances). The wargame underneath is very basic, which works perfectly with for this game. The variable God powers are all interesting and add to the replayability.

This game is something allyable game. If this happen, the game is very bored by king making.

The cards that each player has are very unbalance and chaotic make this game to be a game that use your brain for nothing and has much of PA.

The game setup is too chaotic.
I think I can play this game again if I was convinced but not to setup the game.

This one will earn a lot of comparisons to SmallWorld, and rightly so, but I find the game just as charismatic and in some ways maybe even a little more fun...albeit dead in the water with no expansions. The humor in the rulebooks is quite good, the game is colorful, simple, a fair share of randomness which you can mitigate with some strategy, and in particular I love the Divine Wrath mechanism, the variable player powers (based on which God they drew), the Destiny steps, the bidding...entertaining game here.

The least impressive aspect of this game revolved around it's components.  When I first opened the box, I was a little shocked at what was inside.  Nothing feels very clean and crisp; consequently, when we played the game, it seemed like the lights always needed to be brighter in the room for us to really see the pieces and make out features of the game board.  This aspect doesn't make for the most endearing or enjoyable playing experience.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy this game, but it does have some issues. For one thing, the card quality is really lacking. So is the art on the board and the icons on the cards. Someone got a little too creative with this one. Both sides of every component have different art, but represent the same race, action or ability. Just make up your mind. The funny thing is, neither matches the icon on the card for the race. Also, the board art is no help at all for game set up. These things are really inexcusable in games nowadays, but it won't stop me from playing this light war-ish game again. Why?

I like the hidden identity of the gods and while most don't like not knowing which races you will control in later rounds, I find it compelling that you can't expose yourself, but you also don't want to wipe out another race because they may be yours later on. These make for interesting decisions that I have come to appreciate in games.

I haven't played a game this bad in a long time.  Fits into a similar space to Small World but manages to do just about everything worse.

So the basic tenet of the game is that you must advance the cause of four races.  Sadly, you won't know which four until quite far into the game.  Secondly, you can't actually advance the cause of your secret races because then other players will stomp on you.  Instead you might try to bluff, but then you might just be helping a race that will later contribute to your opponents' score.

The thing is, without the element of bluff this would be a completely barebones Risk-type game.  You would just pick one of your races and use your one attack a turn to hopefully roll the dice well enough to gain a territory.  And this is what the game usually devolves into anyway since you can't bluff all the time, especially near the end.  The irony is that revealing your race actually stops you from attacking with it.  Instead it should have been a tradeoff between keeping it secret and a powerful bonus for revealing.

Also, the game is hideous, an ideal candidate for one of those geeklists about fugly games.

So let me reiterate, go get Small World and never look back.

RATING: 2
[1 match with 4 players]You spend almost half of the match acting almost randomly: you can't help your creatures because your opponents will know which one's your creature and you can't do anything about other creatures because you don't know which ones you will get. So you spend half the match moving pieces almost at random.

2004. AVOID. dice, hidden identity, bluffing, var pl pow; it sounds similar to the game Clans where you can unknowingly help an opponent.

Charles Davis says: Initially you only know one of the 24 tribes is yours. Every 2 turns you get another. There is a lot of potential for bluffing by supporting an unknown tribe or trying to grow them through attacks.

This is a game difficult to play and the core elements are guess, outguessing and bluffing.
At the beginning you just know one of four nations/races you are in favor. But there are 24 Races in total. In every game round it is mandatory to initiate combat and to play a card.
In the first games it is hard to find a game plan. But with some experience you will grab the nuances and the game is shining.

Kinda like a cross between Colossal Arena and Britannia.
Slightly fun game but luck is too prevalent and it suffers from too much "bash the leader".
I think the game would be better as a 30 minute filler instead of taking the 2 hours it currently takes.

edit: I haven't played it in a while and I'd like to give it another shot.

edit: I've since played Small World and, while I don't remember this game that well, I'm pretty sure Small World does everything this game does, but better, in every way.

Fairly fun first game. Similar to Colossal Arena in many respects, but with a little more control over the monsters you want to win.

Update: played again and realized this game really needs 5 or 6 players. We played with 3 and the first half of the game almost nothing happens since half the races on the board aren't used by anyone.

Pretty good game, but hard to get to the table with Small World and Cosmic Encounter in the collection. Rulebook is a little fiddly. It does have some strategy about how to use cards effectively and how to bluff. Setup takes a long time. Only plays well with 4-5. Players turns are fast. Might be good for team play (2 vs 2, 2 vs 3, 2 vs 2 vs 2).

Nicely thematic, but the gameplay is too arbitrary for me. I really enjoyed my first play a number of years ago, but when I tried it again more recently, the hidden "who are you supporting?" (the prime interest) paled in comparison to other games. (Eg: A Study In Emerald.)

RATING: 7
I was surprised at how much fun I had with Age of Gods on my first play. There's a bit of a hurdle to overcome with all the races and their groupings; your first few rounds will involve a lot of double-checking what is what on the board. Once you get going, though, it isn't bad.

The second half of the game - once you have more information in your hand - is much more fun than the first half. There is no reason to attack with anything except the races you back or plan on betting on, so things get interesting later as you get more races assigned to you and you start having to rethink what your bets will be.

Far more fun than I expected and I look forward to future plays.

RATING: 6.5
Not half as bad as many of the negative comments make out. Not chaotic, confusing perhaps but not chaotic. It's an easy romp through fighting and bluffing. There's not enough time to really develop the races, and no real way back from elimination, but for what it is, it's fun. Better with more than 3 players. Confusing rules, read both the rules AND the glossary and FAQ in the game. I played a Revised Edition, and I'd say it could stand more revision. I've played Vinci but not Small World and I wonder if developed, whether AoG would turn into Small World. Certainly I'd put in a development phase before Actions, to beef things up a bit. I'd be happy to play this again, but don't take it seriously.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Wilder and wackier than Small World (much more hidden information, die rolling, and piling on opponents), like an Ameritrash version. A more earnest pastiche (Chaos are from Warhammer, Voracious are clearly Zerg) than Small World's mild parody. The setup is a bit constrained through, as races will always begin in the same locations.

Small World produces ongoing differentiation in races and start locations rather than the tactical differentiation of the cards in Age of Gods.

The game can drag (and have fairly arbitrary swings) with more players.

Combination of bluffing and revealing based upon racial size and one's ability to protect and further them with his ally god's ability could lead to interesting moments if the game was not so ludicrously long.
The randomness of each battle can be additionally infuriating, as one may not only reveal information but accomplish nothing.

Bardzo fajna gra dla ludzi rozpoczynających swoje przygody z grami planszowymi w klimatach fantasy. Nie jest to Small World "ale trochę niedorobiony" tylko zupełnie inna gra. Choć los ma tutaj duże znaczenie, to można na niego wpływać poprzez zagrywanie różnych kart. Jest wystarczająco dużo elementów by kolejne gry nie były takie same, ale z kolei nie na tyle dużo, żeby nie zdawać sobie sprawy z tego co się dzieje. Elementem strategii jest liczenie schodzących kart i eliminowanie możliwości ich zagrywania. Polecam, choć jeśli chcesz mieć całkowitą kontrolę nad przebiegiem rozgrywki to nie jest gra dla ciebie.

Kind of like Titan the Arena but with a wargame.  I think that this game is not rated higher because of the way that it doles out the races that you will control over time so you may end up working to your own disadvantage.  The Gods are also not all equally powered so this can make for an uneven game.  It was kind of fun though and I would play again.

A better game than I had feared.

Age of Gods can be played both as a beer-and-pretzels wargame and as a deeper game, full of risks and bluffs.

I like how combat is manditory and there are regular attacks by the lesser races. Both of those things make the game very dynamic and mean that the board constantly changes.

Weird game of warfare where each player represents a god who secretly controls four different races but only knows one of them at the start. "Control" is not really the right word, as you can attack with any race. Having the corresponding "destiny card" only means that you score for that race at the end of the game. Each race has an associated special power on their cards, but it can actually be used by any race, which harms the thematic immersion. The game is somewhat interesting, and the sheer number of races is impressive, but it is ruined by a lot of randomness and uncontrollable chaos.

Very impressed. Dynamic, tense, and a blast--simple rules with lots of special powers, but all of the special powers are on cards. Sure, it's really really chaotic--but your important decisions are based on proper use of the 8 cards you get at the outset, so there is more scope for clever play and planning than most seem to want to concede.

Where's the game?  You don't know what your objectives are until 3/4 of the game is over.  Each turn you select a source and a target, roll a die and hope for 3 or more to win...  Oh yeah, one of the actions you did previously probably helped someone who just found out his/her objective was to grow that race.  Since you don't know what your objectives are, it is rather difficult to block someone else from achieving his/her objective as he/she don't know what it is either.  A waste of 2 hours of your life.

I prefer this to smallworld, but that doesn't say much..
The combat is too random for my taste, and the game play a bit too chaotic.
The secret bets & winning races are what keeps the game interesting.

Artwork/design could have been better, the map is too cluttered & the pictures on the cards could have been bigger & a bit nicer.

One thing that bothered me, was that all the race abilities weren't tied to the races at all.. You play the goblin card & do some goblin-moves with the high elves..?! Felt quite anti-thematic.

What's not to like? Variable player powers, plenty of bluffing and screwage. Excellent production values. The wealth of counters give it an old school [i]Titan/Kings & Things[/i] feel and personally I love the look of it. Best with fewer than the max # of players, three seems to be the sweet spot offering more chances to bluff with the non-player races. It takes a little time to set up, but once done it plays easily and quickly. A truly fun game.

The first play was very disappointing. I thought it was going to be a war game. It is not, don't be fooled. Now, having played it for what it is, a betting game, I don't mind it. It still won't make it to the table very often, perhaps when there is beer involved.

RATING: 7.5
This is really a wargame where the players don't really know whose side they are on. Its a good bit of fun trying to hide your race, but the early attacks just seem a bit too random. And players will always try to make balancing attacks to keep the smaller races in the game (lest they draw them later).

The entire mechanic of the game is really about war. And as such its a really simple game to play. Just roll the dice and try to score 3 or more. Which is a pity because I would really have liked a little bit more depth, maybe some economics or technology to manage. The other minor gripe is that there are too many races and it feels a bit overwhelming. It also makes it hard to view the different races on the board and see how the are doing. I think the game would be much improved by removing a few races randomly each game.

That aside, it is an enjoyable game and one I would probably be playing quite frequently.

It's okay... Seems like the designer had a good idea but the final result isn't quite there. There wasn't a whole lot of strategy to this one. Sit back and try to hide which army is yours while messing with everyone else. Seems like it could have used some more playtesting for balance issues of the Gods themselves. Some are great while others are useless. Considering they are handed out randomly that doesn't work out.

RATING: 7
Some clever and original ideas here. I loved the theme of a bunch of depraved gods taking only a distant interest in the bloody events of the game, while sponsoring/betting on winners of wars. And the art is pure, glorious Ameritrash, rich with vivid and gory detail on the cards and the board. 

Gameplay is just ever so slightly dull - the problem is, each individual card action and combat move is so piddlingly insignificant by itself to the overall outcome of the game that it's difficult to motivate oneself to either strategize or bluff very much.  

Watching the game sort of play itself is perhaps entertainment enough, though, if (like me) you're into that kind of thing.

Finally played this after a few years of ownership.  Super fun!  Yes, there are random swings that can foil strategies, but overall I think skilled play will give a player an advantage despite those swings. Has some definite graphic design issues (overly busy board, hard to read tokens, no label for "Size" of race on the token itself, card art does not match tokens at all..).  Fun with 5, fun with 4.

AoG is almost like the mutant love-child of Risk and Small World, ...but in a good way. ^_^ Games are usually very close (only a few points between first and last place) and are often decided by fate (drawing the right or wrong card at the right time), but I still enjoy playing. There is little down-time, even in a 5-player game, which keeps everybody happy. 2nd-edition tokens are a VAST improvement over the originals. ^_^

I managed to play this game once at a convention, and was saddened when I was told that it was out-of-print. Hence my glee when I found that it had been re-printed and was at a local game store!

RATING: 8
Seems to offer a working combination of bluffing and strategy. Add Pirates and Lizardmen, and you get something I can't help but like.

The two player game, which is wisely not advertised on the outside box, but only mentioned as technically viable in the rulebook, does not work so well: since there is only one opponent two beat on your mortal puppets, the incentive for bluffing is rather slim compared to a normal game. And this, in turn, leads to a kind of back-and-forth situation where the luck of the dice gets more important than either strategy or reading your opponent.

Played 4 times.

I like the theme of this game, and the idea of messing around with so many races is pretty fun.  It has some lightly disjointed actions, such as the Action cards being used for any race, but besides that the game really comes down to a huge bluff-fest.  Fantasy Poker if you will.  You can't heavily defend your peoples as you don't want others to find out what you rule over, but at the same time you can't let them be dissemated either.  Leads to some anxious moments which can be fun.  I'm sure I'll play it again.  Interesting art, but a cluttered look to the board, and not always super easy to readily identify tokens.  Good thing the tokens have 2 sides so you can pick which side you want up.  Makes idetification a tad bit easier.

I liked this, but couldn't get anyone else into it. Traded 8/15.

I was completely engrossed in my first play of this.  It felt different in a cool way. Bluffing is very important here.  Constant, constant battling. Looking at your action cards for creative ways on how to use them to hurt the other races.  And there is not much of a defensive strategy, no turtling,  you really need to be hitting and moving. 

I think we didn't even scratch the surface of whats possible in this game. 

First game was a tie 18/18/13. If I wasn't a dumb-ass (I taught and told others NOT to do this at least 3 times) and bet on one of my OWN races, I would have probably won.

Really like this and want to play again soon.

Backwards played game with so much hidden information and luck that it becomes kind of pointless. It is not the chaos that bothers me, it´s the lack of meaningful decisions. It seems the best strategy would be to mess with some two random factions leaving your own out of attention, but I don´t find it engaging to attack some random faction with another random faction. And the fact that some of those attacked factions might end up being yours in the later turns makes it even worse.

I was surprised. Positively.
At first I expected something between Mission: Red Planet and Kings&Things, but then I realised it was something more.
The game was actually fun to play. And despite the fact that I'm not a human psyche expert, I found the guessing of the others' peoples very rewarding.

Luck is still very prominent factor in the game but it can be minimized quite easily.

Players play Gods, whilst the various races on the board between you can be controlled by anyone. Over time you learn which races pray to you, and so which ones you want to prosper most, but at the same time you want to avoid your opponents knowing just who you favour. You also get to gamble on the good fortunes of other races, as Gods are capricious things.

This game has proved very popular with my friends.

The first few times we played this game, none of the players enjoyed it. There appeared to be too much chaos; too little opportunity to plan. We put it away for over a year and would have sold it but for the low prices on ebay due to the economic crisis.

Recently we pulled it out again (after well over a year). For some reason it all began to gel; we had a great time. This is a fun beer and pretzels game that plays quickly. Our original aversion to the hidden armies melted away as we discovered that this adds another factor to consider. This bit of "Mr. Jack" actually improves the game.

This was an enjoyable game to play.  There are only nine (9) turns to the game.  You randomly select an unknown race that you want to keep the identity hidden.  You do this selection every other turn starring with the first turn.  You gain points by how many areas all four of your races control at the end ot the game.  Furthermore and more imporantly you want to select two cards (names at the top of the cards) and set them aside for scoring at the end.  These represent two races you predict will survive.  Each player will gain three (3) points, per card, for each race that survives.  These points may win you the game.

First play down and it was quite fun. The similarity to Small Worlds is so close one clearly ripped off (its too close for inspired by) the other. You control races, the races you control expanding, with which you try to conquer territory. At the end of the game you score points for that territory and the player with the most wins (barring a few extra bits and pieces). Most of the game revolves around combats which are resolved by dice rolls. But the real key bit is that races are secret, and anyone can control any race.
There are some massive logical inconsistencies in the game, by the far the biggest is that when you are the declared and openly worshipped god of a race you can't give them orders but everyone else can but these aren't too hard to put aside.
Where Small Worlds plays quite tactically with decisions being based around the position this turn or next. But Age of Gods plays strategically because everything rests on that final turn.
Which one you prefer I think depends on your play preferences but for me I suspect Age of Gods will just slightly edge it as it feels just a little more fun (though certainly a greater random element).

Quite liked the bluffing and gambling elements, but the boring combat system and clunky use of cards providing too many choices really detracted from the experience.

At first, there does not appear to be enough control.  However, I'm not convinced it's as bad as it looks, and it might simply be a more subtle game that it first appears.

That said, being less random than the very random first impression is still faint praise, and ultimately I think there are better games for fantasy conflict, inferring loyalties, or indirectly controlling warring nations.  Small World, Imperial, and Colossal Arena all come to mind as preferable, and I'm not even a super fan of those games.

[b]Small World[/b] meets [b]Colossal Arena[/b].

At first, I was wary of the game as several reviews panned it and its cheap price tag of $5 was not the best indicator of its success, but after a single play it was clear that there was fun to be had with this game.

It may lack the simplicity of the aforementioned games, but the bluffing aspect is compelling enough to warrant its inclusion in your collection. However, I would not play this game with more than four players as there becomes a shortage of "neutral" races - that is, races you can use to mislead your opponents - and as such the game's fun factor plummets dramatically. Three to four players is the sweet spot.

Highly recommended for the ameritrash-war-gamers.

[b]Edit (12/2016):[/b] I still play this from time to time because I like the bluffing element but the fighting mechanism - rolling a single die - is very underwhelming. Still, I haven't come another war game quite like it to replace it, but I tend to play other war games over it ([b]Kemet[/b], [b]Nexus Ops[/b], [b]Neuroshima Hex[/b], etc.).

This game was a surprisingly great amount of fun.  It reminded me of a cross between Conquest of the Fallen Lands, Titan Arena, Wizard Kings, an abstract area-control game, and a few old-style fantasy board games.  The hidden information for controlling the powers really makes the game.  

The game is wild and chaotic, so it's probably best not to attempt to take the game very seriously.  I can't remember a game where the attacker was at such an advantage over the defender.  Additionally, the artwork and map is very nice, although I suppose some might find the map to be too colorful.

RATING: 7
Played 20+ times:

One important aspect that people miss, which is absolutely critical to gameplay, is planning for the betting round in turn seven. The bonus points are huge and may likely decide the game.

This feature shapes long term strategies beginning in turn one. You actually begin with three races: Your initial race, plus the choice of two races (which may change during the game) from the cards in your hand. So really, you start the game knowing more than half of your objectives, and you certainly have more meaningful choices in the first few turns than some people seem to realize. If you feel that you are simply throwing away turns in the early game, you need to rethink your strategy.

24(!) different races battle it out on a very charmingly illustrated gameboard. It just makes me smile. The God's abilities are unique and very different from each other. Add to that the different abilities for each of the races and you have a very thematic setting.  This kind of game connects with me. Maybe the rating might drop after the novelty wears off, but maybe not, because the replay value is high.

Update: Age of Gods is crazy fun. Yeah, yeah, maybe it's not for everyone, but for me, the game is so fun and plays so quickly that the fun factor overcomes any niggly perceived negatives.

Shallow combat system, but it works for the game. This is less a game of strategy and more a game of trickery. Fun game, everyone I've played it with loves it.

OK, but over-chaotic.  Information was hidden too long which made early moves pretty random - nobody dared move their own races for fear of everybody piling on top of them.

A betting game disguised as a fantasy conquest game. The gameplay is alright, but the board as busy as kaleidoscope and you won't feel much like a deity. It's not bad game, not a great one, just an awkward one with a theme done better in Smallworld.

I will accept that perhaps I played the game in the "wrong way", but that to me is the mark of a poor game.  I shouldn't have to follow a specific path.  The game is simply too chaotic for me to enjoy.

I really enjoy the sort of bluffing element in this game, wherein you can move any race, but want to avoid doing anything really dramatic with any of your races early on, so as not to give away your intentions. Very heavy on the fantasy theme, which my friends really like, but obviously may not be for everyone. A thumbs up for me!

In this game the players are ancient gods that are trying to make their chosen tribes prosper and conquer the land. The twist is that the gods/players don't know all their chosen tribes at the beginning of the game, these are given to them only every other round. There are 24 different tribes which start on predefined spaces on the board. These tribes are divided into four different levels and have as many counters on the board at the beginning of the game as their level indicates (1, 2, 3 or 4 tokens). The biggest part of the game are the battles between the tribes. The funny part is that the players are not restricted to use their tribes in the fighting, they can make other tribes fight among themselves.

In some ways this is the game I always wanted Small World to be. Small World is cool, but the decision space is rather small. What race to draft and when to retire it are pretty much the only things that take much thought. Combat moves almost play themselves and rarely is a defensive move worth it. Age of Gods changes all that, by allowing you to play all of the races. Every turn you are deciding who to expand, who to push back, who to exploit and who to hold back for scoring purposes. Even when you aren't making direct decisions, you are trying to get a read on exactly what your opponents are trying to accomplish. All of this makes for a much more engaging game than Small World.

That being said, it does play at a slower pace, which might be a turnoff for some. Combat has a few dice modifiers to calculate and rarely will more than one territory change hands on a given turn. Early moves tend to be a little bit random, since no one wants to weaken a race too much, in case they later end up having to score them. This is technically supposed to aid in bluffing your true intentions, but with so little information early on (even about your own goals) it's a bit of a stretch to glean anything in the early rounds. Still, it's a nice change of pace from the standard area control game and the bluffing aspect gets stronger as the game progresses. While the early stuff is largely meaningless, it sort of sets the tone for the game and gets everyone comfortable with lying about their various misdirections.

The biggest challenge to the game's reputation is the artwork. The board is garish and busy, the tokens are ugly on their named side and indiscernible from one another on the front side, more often than not. In practice, it's not as hard to remember where everyone is at as I made it just sound, but regardless, it could have been a whole nicer. Otherwise, I don't have too much bad to say about it. It might be a hair too static over the long haul (The races all start in the same place every game, and all races are always in play) and the somewhat thin combat mechanic might get repetitive, but for casual or infrequent play this game is far better more deserving than the Tanga trash pile it ended up on.

Age of Gods (Revised edition) I don't know what the original unrevised edition was like but if this game had plastic bits for the races you'd think it was pure Ameritrash.  A great game of bluffing and holding out on tipping your hand as long as possible.  There's luck of the dice rolls in combat but abilities and enhancements can mitigate some of the luck.  It's a clean combat system where you pick your race, add or subtract the modifiers, roll a die and apply the results.  If you don't like combat or the theme then stay away.  This one is about survival of your races.

My first play I thought this was a neat game. However, after multiple plays, I just did not enjoy the randomness that is innate in the mechanics of the game. It lacks a lot of strategy, and I think I had more fun playing the game without knowing any of my races at all.

The experience is fun, but there is absolutely no way to control the outcome.  For the most part, a series of minor decisions based largely on random input.  I'd play it again, but I'll be getting rid of my copy.

Light, random fun. Initially you only know one of the 24 tribes is yours. Every 2 turns you get another. There is a lot of potential for bluffing by supporting an unknown tribe or trying to grow them through attacks. However, you may be helping someone else when doing this. This is not a game for grand strategy. You just don't know enough. Fun for what it is. Attractive board and bits.

Wow what a chaos bath.  If you like plenty of hidden information and bluffing and double bluffing as to who you even are give this one a try!

I look forward to exploring how it evolves as we introduce alliances and diplomacy to our playing style.

After everything I read online I was unsure about what to expect...it turned out to be a good experience...the combat is smooth and simple and the bluffing is easier than I thought...this isn't a war game, so you have to think of it as an area control game with some dice rolls, powers and bluffing...people that say it's too difficult to strategize and bluff when you don't know who's who or who you will be are making it seem harder than it actually is...

I admit it. It's hard to find a game that my wife and I both like.

I like strategy games, preferably the ones that let you really mess with other players. Like something between Brain and Dr. Evil I lay in wait living for the time to unleash my latest master plan to rule the world.

My wife likes to roll the dice and have something "cool" happen.

As it turns out we both liked this game. Combat for me is a little overly simplistic - I like the defender getting a roll. I also like consequences for a failed attack. This has neither.

She became a real predator in this game, which is unlike her to like any game where there is combat. But the combat model isn't overly complicated. It has some interesting rules and I like the fact that no one knows who your races are, and the cards can bring a lot of twists to the game. Turns happen quickly (in general) and the game has a lot of replay to it. We played with a few friends who aren't very heavy "gamers" and they had fun as well. 

A good balance in a game I think, pretty easy to learn and fun to play.

And, I kind of like that let's me be a God. Oooooh the POWER!

Feinting and bluffing can be helpful, as keeping your "chosen" peoples a secret may help shield them from attack.  On the other hand, empowering them and upgrading their technology gives them a better chance of earning you those precious victory points.  The ability to cash in on others' success by "betting" a people will reach their maximum size helps level the playing field if your peoples have gotten pounded.  Since you are dealt nearly your entire hand of actions right at the start of the game, you can strategize to a moderate degree.  (Nearly everything is resolved by die rolls, and the chaotic influence of other players' actions and combat tend to require a lot of reaction and adaptation of your plans.)

Due to the structure of the game, more players directly means more time.  This is a game that takes X minutes per player to play, so when you play with six, it's several hours long.  I'd like to try it with two next, which should be suspenseful!

An interesting game with an original concept and straightforward mechanics. Lots of bluffing opportunities coupled with action cards, one of my favorite things (when done correctly). The game is too long, however, and could possibly be too lucky an affair to justify that length. At times, it can feel as though one has little control over the outcome, since luck is always present and necessary information is handed out slowly.

This is one of the few combat-oriented games I can get my family to play, and, thankfully, they enjoy it as much as I do.  We really like the capriciousness of the gods and trying to deduce the races of our opponents.  My son and I also have a 2-player variant where we conduct two combat rounds/phases per turn, with the restriction that the second combat round cannot involve any races engaged in the first round.  This was one of the first board games I ever purchased, and it still remains a favorite.

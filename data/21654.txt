I had a somewhat bad experience my first game of this - I'm not sure if it was my explanation, but the basic elements of the game just didn't sink in with a couple of people in our group. We wanted to play a relatively quick filler, and it ended up draggin on to about 90 minutes with a lot of slow play and question asking, with 6 players.

My first impressions of this are good.  It seems that it's likely that the best way to play with even numbers is in teams.

The mechanisms are fun and well-executed.  It is true that certain cards are often more valuable than others in battle - but then it really does depend on what else you and your opponenets have in their hands.

The closest games to this are probably Ivanhoe and the card playing part of Empires of The Ancient World.

Interesting multiplayer cardgame. Very similar to Condottiere(same designer) Its a hand management game. Doesn't have a board so it uses a Victory Points system instead. It awards points to players according to their final position after the each battle. So while in Condottiere it is 'first or nothing' here aiming for the second place is also a valid target.

Very nice game, quite similar to Condottiere in gameplay and feel. I'm slightly worried about its kingmaking potential with 3+ players, I played it with 4 and it wasn't that bad, thus I will give it the benefit of the doubt, though I can imagine this can be a problem, so I would like to check how this works with just 2 players.

Only played this once, but I must say that this does not seem like my type of game. Too tough choices and too little fun for me.

RATING: 7
Rather like Condottiere but not as good in my opinion (at least not with 5 which is how we played it - I understand partnerships is better). Condottiere has limited direct interaction which makes the game all about bluff and outwitting opponents. Iliad has so much direct interaction that all the interpersonal battling goes out the window.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I liked it after my first game, less so after my second.  The interactions between the units are interesting, but the end-of-round scoring is confusing for me, so I can't see what I should be doing during the round to maximise our team's score.

Pretty good little card game, similar to Condottiere but I prefer the greater interaction as players wreak havoc on each others' forces.  Although, I will admit sometimes the battles seem to rely too much on attrition.  You really have to know when to play and when to hold back. 

The team variant is the best way to play.

Firstly, Condotierre is SO much better than this...I'm afraid this game didnt grab me enough for me to figure out if it's better than my first impression tells me. Random, chaotic and even a bit irritating, there isnt enough time to create a meaningful strategy and there is too much time if your cards just happen to suck. How about starting the game with 6 archers?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Luck of the deal can be a significant factor in this light hand management war game. I liked that it's relatively easy to learn, having only a few different types of cards. But the limited types of cards leads to a limited feeling game, which can therefore seem a bit long for what it is -- a game where I play this and you play that to counter it, then I play this to counter your counter. A poor hand or poor timing of a Gorgon round can be devastating to some and a huge boon to others. Having the lead (gained by winning the previous hand) seems like quite a big advantage with respect to initiative in getting cards out.

A fun game that works almost equally as well for two as it does for multiple players. A rare thing indeed. The mechanic works well and you are constantly faced with difficult decisions. Do you play all the cards in your hand and walk away with an easy victory - only to undoubtedly lose the next round, or do you sacrifice a victory so that you can win a more important battle later on. I bought this one because the picture on the box looked cool (shame on me) but I have never regretted it.

Good card-based combat game.  The card artwork is excellent and helps to effectively convey the ancient Troy theme.  There is a little bit of a strategic element, but mainly the game is all about the individual battles and, thus, more tactical in nature.  Very much like Condottiere, another good card-based combat game, but this one has a slightly more complex tactical aspect.  Overall, a fun, short combat-themed game.  Great companion game to Condottiere due to the similarity in the game mechanics.

RATING: 3
Pretends to be more than it is.  Delivers less than it promises.  Purports to be a hand management game, except that it gives almost no insight into the other players hands which are you are supposedly managing yours against, and then wastes what little information you did earn with the 3 card draw.  Some take-that, some bluff, some simple relative cost accountancy, but little actually interesting.

I want this game to be better than it actually is.  I liked Condotierre and the promise of a Homer-themed edition with expanded warmaking options certainly interested me but I feel strangely disappointed by Iliad despite the great art, the easy take-that gameplay, and the solid siege theme.  I think the game is really kind of hamstrung by wanting to have more options than a single-action mechanic allows for- the result is that every round pretty much follows a general course of action where players build up siege weapons and defenses and then try to survive a pounding while trying to squeak ahead in army value.  Pretty realistic and a cool concept, but it just seems dull.  There's a lot to like- great art, a neat idea incorporating two different types of sieges and different stakes for each round, and nasty, vindictive play- but ultimately the game just seems to come up short.  It really isn't like Condotierre at all, but to its advantage over that game it is _less_ of a bidding sort of affair and the  pointless territorial struggle is abstracted in a good way.  Maybe some more plays will tease out something better than my first few plays did, but for now it's decent but not something I would play over its predecessor or Ivanhoe.

Played 2-player about three times so far. Interesting, but I always seem to get behind in cards (I spend more cards than my opponent) and have a difficult time catching back up (since we both draw the same number at the end of each siege). I'd like to try this with more players before rating.

Update: The game is vastly better with more players. I like it quite a bit now--it's short but has interesting decisions and some gambles (deciding whether to participate in a siege over lower-valued victory points, for instance, versus holding your cards and waiting for the next round).

Got this. Satisfied with the play for the price. 6.5A full point higher if played only as a partnership game. Component quality is very good all around. However, the heroes should have been made out of thick cardboard, like the chalices, so as to prevent them from getting shuffled in with the army cards by accident. 

The meta game (cities, boats, agemon) is good and has a nice effect on the main play. With all values revealed, game can grind (common) if players want to optimize during their turn, which causes downtime. The three card replenish seems lean and arbitrary, could have perhaps worked in a catchup mechanic for the last place players here. 
I won't house rule it yet though, needs more play. When playing lean on cards, play speeds up but also flattens out. So it has the dual problem of being too slow when everyone has loads of cards, and not deep enough when players are low on cards. 

UPDATE: More considerations, I think the Game inside the box is not so much the cardplay as it is the metagame of choosing when to fold so as to save cards and dominate a future round. The Gorgon, 5VP princess and opportunity for reward specialization (Boats or Cities) hit all the right notes here. I would still like to see richer cardplay, this might be adressed by an expansion or variant? No rating change: 6.5, add a point if played in partnerships.

UPDATE: I'm going to score this as if played in partnerships only. If NOT played in partnerships, then -1 to score.

After one play:  Wow, this game is a lot better than I was expecting.  It really is a wargame, and it's got sufficient depth (hmmmm... use this resource and win now but have few reserves left for next battle or hold what I've got and hope it's good enough?) and cardplay to reward experience and planning, but without taking forever to play.

I'm looking forward to playing again.

It's a cardgame that features a series of auctions. You place cards on the table to increase your bid, and can expend them to reduce them to reduce opponents bids (catapults and archers and the like). There are enough fiddley factors and calculations that it can't be played at a fast pace, except after a few hands. And by that time, most people would rather be playing a more interesting game. I think the earlier iteration, called Condotierre, struck a better balance of speed and complexity.

I have not yet tried the rules for team play, which opinion here regards as a superior to the free-for-all.

SOLD IT!

I mainly bought the game as a 2 player game, which it IS NOT. With 2 players you may as well deal out all the cards and see who has the higher point value, and they win.

Now, I can see were things would get more interesting with more players, but I can think of a ton of games I'd rather play if we had more players... so in the end, skip this one.

Another one of those free-for-all, luck-of-the-draw games. No real decision-making involved. Play defensive cards if you have them. Play offensive cards if you have them. I would not recommend Iliade if that's all there is to it. The designer is probably aware of the problem too, which is probably why Iliade includes rules for team play for 4 or 6 players. That probably gives the game a bit more replayability...

The two player game differs from the 3-6 player game, and I'm not sure why, really.  What was confusing, was the instruction to skip to the 2 player flavored game at the end... and then realize you still had to go back and read other rules and delete things... a clearer ruleset would make it easier to pick up and play.

I did get the gist of the game over a couple of hands, though, and it's not a bad game, although one of extreme attrition ~ 3 new cards per siege (round), out of a starting hand of 12.  If you or your opponent(s) lay out high points in a single siege, the lack in future rounds will hurt you.  Pass early, and pass often?  Maybe.   There is a good game here, though.  Just takes a little effort to find it through the rules.

RATING: 6.5
Two plays in.  It went quicker with most of the players understanding what each piece could do, but the game slows because its necessary to be constantly counting up everybody else's scores and min/maxing your own play.  Then, there are all of these fiddly scoring pieces, which can cause a sudden anticlimactic end to the game.  These flaws are worse in the team game, but the team game is still more fun than the individual game.

Calling the theme thin would be generous.  I'm aware that it was originally designed with another time and place in mind - but even beyond the historical inaccuracies, the game does not impart any sense of siege combat.  It plays like a tactical abstract team card game, and I'm not sure that it outshines quicker, simpler standard deck games.

An excellent blind purchase! The level of player interaction is very high. The best games so far have been 2 on 2 and 4-player team play. The cards interactions are spot on and the scoring of the Hoplites is very entertaining...provided you can keep them alive. This is going to get played over and over. Each time Iliade has been played it dominates the attention of my group for hours.

Only one play (5 player so far).  5 player seemed overly long and distribution of victory cards meant that no one reached the magic 12 before they ran out.  Need to check the rules on this.  Suspect 4 is better than 5.

Not my cup of tea. It's a sophisticated Take That game, nice graphics, nice ideas, but it's still a take that game. I don't like elimination. No doubt, with experience, you learn how to protect yourself, and as a partnership game it may be better, but I didn't enjoy Iliad.

A war card game for up to 6, with a strong luck factor and strategy.  

Each player starts with 12 cards, but after each battle is replenished with only 3.  Victory conditions of battles vary.  The strategy comes in choosing your battles.

When I first read the rules of the 9 different defense and offense cards, I thought the game would be too complicated for occasional play.  Into the game however, I discovered the cards' icons very neatly display the card's abilities and what isn't shown can be found on a very nice player's aid which I am laminating.

It's a shame this visually nice cards are not on better card stock.  

This classic a game I have owned for a long time & it just never made it to the table.  Since I have many war games, this one probably has the best chance of getting played when traveling (approx 7" x 3 3/4"), although not a first choice.

I ended up trading this one. Timing and bluffing, two things I have yet to master, are essential in this game.  I'm starting to have doubts about the two-player rules: they're okay , but the game suffers from the "runaway leader" problem.

Homer's Iliad tells us how the Greeks battled the Trojans. This game proves they primarily fought among themselves. Since the biggest spoils go to the commander most successful in battle they'll gladly take swings at their fellow kinsmen to reduce the strength of the competition.

If you know Condottiere or Ivanhoe you will already have a good idea of how that works. The game is played in rounds where each represents one attack. Cards played to the table increase a player's combat strength and often also allow taking shots at other players to reduce theirs. At the end of the battle the each player may choose one of the available spoils starting with the strongest. The second to last player gets nothing, and the weakest usually gets negative VP.

Since you only get 3 new cards after each battle you need to commit your troops wisely, or you'll run out quickly. Direct attacks make this game more interactive and more volatile than the two aforementioned titles, the large amount of support cards that do not in themselves add to your combat strength make it more dependent on good card draws, and generally speaking a lot hinges on the goodwill (or illwill) of your fellow players. Overall, that makes the results feel a lot less meaningful.

Bought - Dec 2006. The more I play this, the more I like it. It travels well, and plays will with 3 . So many great decisions to be made; taking chances/risks; some bluffing; a game of timing. Knowing when to play and when to drop out. Being willing to settle for second, even be willing to take a Thanatos to cut your losses and be better prepared for the next siege. These are but a few of the choices to be weighed and made in a successful campaign. 
April 2008 update. Still a great game. Lots of player interaction. This is a game of "jockeying." Constantly watching what others are doing, how many cards in their hands, judging when to play which card. We play with total table-talk, negotiations, deal-making, and going after the winner. It takes a cunning player to pull out the win with experienced players.

RATING: 9

With 2 players is just a quick, nice & entertaining game. Luck plays a significant part here. The major flaw of the 2 player game is the fact that you put aside the oracle (the essence of the game!) and the hero cards. (With 2 players it's a 6 actually).

3+ players and (even better) Team play (4 or 6 players) is by far the best. Deeper, subversive, richer. Luck plays a relatively smaller part here, which is nice. Finally all the different aspects of the game come into play. (With the team play of 4 or 6 players it's easily a 9).

VERY IMPRESSED with this game so far. 

Don't get me wrong, this is a very well done game, but ultimately a filler. 
A very good, strategic, for experienced gamers, filler. 

There are a lot of nuances to this game. Hand management is very important and every choice counts. It is important not to escalate into an open conflict with an other player, you'll pay for it as the game progresses. 

The final battle is a true epic, like the Iliad itself. 
I highly recommend it.

A good little game. After one play (3 players), I think that it is not suited for this number. I liked what was going on in the game, but it just seemed too easy to pick your battles, and too much was determined by the luck of the draw. However, I really felt that the game would be much better with more players, since the rewards change with more. I look forward to trying it with more. *Update* Have now played with four, and I liked it both a little better and a little less. The gameplay is definitely better with more than three, but a second play exposed the game as not having as much depth as I originally thought. Still good, but not great.

This seems like a very enjoyable game of hand management, but it seems like it would have kingmaker problems. I am anxious to play this again, because it seems that there is either more or less strategy than it seems at first glance. Depending on that, my rating will likely change. I love the theme and the way the cards work, and am also very anxious to play the team version. I am also somewhat worried about the level of complexity, but we will see how the explanation goes with non-gamers.
UPDATE: This one has grown on me after more plays. I really don't have any other games where hand management plays such a critical role. The theme and mechanics both make this one a unique and enjoyable experience.

Played with 5 and enjoyed it.  This is an advanced Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with 8 different card types.  The best defensive card is the Catapult, but it's worth 0 points, while the most useless offensive card is the Hoplite, which becomes the most potent, point wise, when you stack them in a Phalanx.  You need to manage your hand in order not to overextend by playing too many cards, as all you get between rounds is 3 new cards.

The theme feels right for this one, and the other 4 players enjoyed it as well.  Definately one we will be playing again!  And the artwork is pretty good too.

A card game where you are affectively bidding for a variable number of victory points, with a strong element of 'Take that!' thrown in. This is a kind of psychological game that I don't really enjoy, you can't stop an opponent bidding and the deeper you get into a battle over a good card, the less you want to let it go and the more an uninvolved player benefits. Taj Mahal is much better, and I'm no fan of that.

Iliad is a lame mix of blase mechanics with a serious luck of the draw issue and a rather straight forward one track strategy.  It basically boils down to building up your defenses, hoping your late entry offensive line holds up, and dropping before you deplete yourself too much (kind of like Taj Mahal but not nearly as interesting or tight).  I won my first game despite trailing the entire time with an extremely sub par hand and was still totally unappeased.  I'm almost tempted to say it might be broken...but I won't.  Not to mention, the theme is as loose as can be...Ballistas, Catapults, and LotR style elephants in the assualt on troy?  Really?!

Still, I would play it again - so take from that whatever you will.

Strongly reminds Condottiere by the same designer.

In theory it is developed, better Condottiere, but somehow it isn't the case for me.
Iliade has more rules, unit types, VP types etc. but it still has considerable luck factor, which might undermine your plans.  And that's why I prefer Condottiere: it is simpler, a bit faster and does not aspire to be deep - when you lose because of bad luck, it's fast defeat and you feel that's normal in a fun game.  In Iliade, however, you might be more disappointed - you have more options and you expect to seriously compete for win whereas bad luck can strike you as severely as in Condottiere.

BUT Iliade is not a bad game at all.  It can provide some fun.  Just don't be mislead by possibilities it offers; you will have to depend on some luck and other players' moves anyway.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit and thought it played very well. Hand management hell with a very good screwage effect, chicken wars, set collection and some interesting scoring make for some dynamic play. I liked the cumlative goals to strive for and how you had to try to protect them if you had them or strip them away from your opponents. 

Feels like a multiplayer card war game and with a unique feel, no AP, some angst and strategic and tactical play. Some luck (cards) but not too much for length.  Good theme, felt like my guys were hiding in my "Trojan horse", wall was put up and indeed protecting, etc it came out fairly well. 4 best multi or teams or 6 in teams, 6 individual chaotic. 3 or 5 indivdual should be 'okay' but there can be a 2 gang up on one effect potentially, especially with 3.

So far so fun.  This is a really fun game for 6 players!  I just played with 4 and had some fun with it there too.  The only problem we encountered is that one player kind of got dealt a hand full of Catapults and Trojan Horses...they were kind of useless as he didn't have anything to put in the Torjan horses.  So effectively he was playing with only 3-4 cards for a few turns.  So initially he didn't like it.

Other than that - I think it's a fun partner game (haven't played on my own yet!).  Lots of interesting decisions each turn.  Can be a bit of a brain burn as you try to think X turns ahead...wondering what someone will play if you play this or that.  I've played it twice and have won it twice - so I like it so far! :-)

A game in the vein of Condottiere but a better one (and complex) IMO. The theme is very neat although it has minor impact on the gameplay. The art is gorgeous.
It is a hand management game with a healthy doses of luck and a high "screw you" factor. I have had a lot of fun playing this and it is better still if you play with partnerships. 

An excellent filler and one I won´t refuse to play

This is the perfect example of how much I have changed over the years. I just read the description I gave for the game on 2012 and it definitively doesn’t sound like a game I would enjoy. Besides on that year I liked almost every game I played. I bought Iliad to try it again soon, but I’m pretty sure its rating isn’t 8.5 so I’m downgrading it right now.

When I play it again I will come back to comment again, however “take that” games aren’t among my favorites.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play, which I lost. It builds on the strong cardplay elements of its ancestor Condottiere by adding more options for hurting the opposition's deployed cards. However, Iliad avoids the older game's Achilles' heel (spot what I just did there??) by having a much more interesting scoring/victory structure than Condottiere's clunky city control mechanism.

Warning: it's an Asmodée glossy box production, so those who struggled to open the Mission Red Planet box (I can't believe I just typed that) may need to freshen up their box opening skills. (Or just shoot themselves - they'd be doing the planet a favour).

Iliad is a card game where players are all competing against each other to siege Troy. I guess you'd have to think of it as competing generals, each with their own armies, that squabble and compete to do the most damage to the city. Each hand is a siege with victory point cards at stake. Players play army cards from their hand to the table to build their strength. Some cards contribute directly to your strength, some cards are doublers, some keep your army values hidden, and some simply wreak havoc on your opponent's tableaus. It takes some getting used to, what each card can do to whom. Also, at the beginning of each hand, you draw to see what kind of siege it is. The requirements for winning each are different and require different tactics. In one, the 3 strongest armies after everyone passes get points, in the the other, if a player has the strongest army at the start of the their turn BEFORE ANY CARDS ARE PLAYED, instantly wins gets the only points. That is a straightforward rule, but what it means to game play takes a little getting used to.

It's a game you have to play once to really understand all the ins and outs, I think. You don't want to expose your high-value cards too early, or they will get attacked. I kind of think of this game as a more complex and much improved version of the old Games Workshop title, Chaos Marauders, where players are generals competing to be the first to muster 15 goblin soldiers, all the while attacking and messing with each other.

Forgot that I owned this game. I bought it because it's easy to teach and we can get in a couple of games in at lunch time. My gaming group for lunch has dropped, as they have moved on to other companies and/or retired. The art work is great and I like the theme.

RATING: 5.5
Not really my kind of thing.  I got it because it was supposed to be an extension of Condottiere.  It is more warlike - more "take that", and less like a bidding game now.  On the plus side, they've made it short and sweet.  Nice, varied art too.

The type of chaotic card play here reminded me of Pacific Typhoon, but whereas I felt like PT was just short of being really good, Iliad felt just above being completely random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The author managed to make his already weak and overrated game Condottiere even weaker by adding huge unrestricted take that elements to the mix. The best strategy in this game is to support the leader to assure the quickest possible game end. Otherwise the game will drag to a close end in the maximal possible time and will randomly be decided by the best final card draw and not being arbitrarily hit by attack cards from players who are not in contention for winning any more.
The good rating might stem from a partnership variant as comments state. My one play was with 5 players individually.

RATING: 7
This is one of those games about which I knew nothing until I got it as part of a big trade, and it may in fact be the only thing I have left from that trade. It is perhaps my favorite card game, offering a fun, confrontational experience with a nice (if anachronistically handled) Trojan War theme. The cards are of pretty good stock, though they're black edged. The iconography is a bit much at first, but once mastered--and it doesn't take long--it nearly obviates the need for rules lookup, though having one of the nice landscape-printed BGG cheat sheets by your side helps out, too. While this is not "recommended" by the BGG community for two-player play, I respectfully differ: the game is different, taking on the cast of a straight-up duel and losing the Oracle and Hero trappings, but it is a great little half-hour game. You can't, however, easily play the multiplayer game the same way: not only are the different siege types a factor, but blowing too many of your cards on even one of the three-point VP cards is going to get you creamed.

Definitely not a bad game. I took part in a 6-player team game and it lasted way too long. Cardplay instantly reminded me of Taj Mahal, but it is a bit smoother since you can't crash your own game as easily by overplaying. The team game aspect is both nice and forces the style of play of partners. Luck of draw and the benefits of passing are both touches that make this game more interesting.

RATING: 2
Don't even get me started on the number of Trojan Horses in the deck. This game doesn't have the worst mechanic, but the choices of which opponent to screw over are sometimes quite arbitrary, so they lead to a situation where the leader inevitably gets hammered. There aren't enough hoplites for my taste - you often end up with an army that can destroy other armies' siege engines but nothing else. A simple way to deal with this might be to award a card bonus for losing. I won't be playing it again, though.

I have only played this game in 2-players mode.

In 2-players mode, I think this game is quite balance. Of course any card games have luck, but you can control some of them. In some turns, you may just pass (or put 1 card), lose that turn, and wait to draw some more cards. In fact, I think this is the most important decision in the game.
(2011-08-14)


I have played this game in 3-playes mode today.

I personally hate the Oracle cards a lot. The average score of a city/ship is 2(for the highest war power), and the average score of an Orcale card is -1.5(for the lowest war power). It is impossible to win every war, but after you win a war, you have used so many cards that you must lose 1 to 2 wars. The gain cannot overcome the lost...

This game to me is like a simplified version of Condottiere.  The difference is the person who has the weakest army gets negative points where the strongest chooses one of the victory points out.  Also gorgon rounds allow players to build hands or go for a fast win.

RATING: 8
I'll wait to rate this until I play with more players, but with three, it's brutal.  Like Condottiere, it has only a few simple types of cards which interact in interesting ways; unlike Condottiere, there's a strong disincentive to just pass--coming in last is substantially worse than coming in second.

I'm predisposed to like this because it's by Dominique Ehrhard, and also because it was a gift from my friend Dan (and my wife ordered me a copy too).

Update: I'm calling this an 8, although in the 4-6 player space I would probably suggest 2nd-edition [gameid=112] instead.

I'm not sure this plays that well with two players.  It just felt like the loser of the first siege was almost predetermined to lose the game unless that person quit early enough and had a better card draw than the opponent.  I think it might work with 3 or more much better.  Reminded me of Havoc: Hundred Years War in some ways with more action cards instead of set collection.

RATING: 6
Good, relatively short, and fast paced game.  Luck seems to play a significant role in some situations.  Relatively simple rules that look more complicated than they really are.  Nice illustrations.  The black border on the card can be easily damaged (the white cardboard becomes apparent in places around the edges).  OK with 2.  With 3, there is the added dimension of figuring out who you should bother first, or protect against.  With teams (4 or 6 players), some more depth is added by having to guess the strengths and weaknesses of your partner.  Luck can seem important: you're at the mercy of the luck of draw if you have a small hand (with only 3 cards drawn between rounds); it's sometimes important to accept an early defeat in order to gather strength for combats to come.

What can I say. Another good game but without anything that would make you go crazy about it and rush to the next store to buy it. It's basically a better Condottiere, so if you're pondering which game of this type to buy then go for Iliad. The gameplay is much less chaotic than in Condottiere and hand management is even more important. The passing mechanism is also nice in that it favors passing early and that, coupled with smart moves during your turns, might bank you some points without wasting any cards (that is: not wasting more than you will re-draw).

This title is all about judging your ability to stand up to the other players in order to decide to continue your fight or give the round to them in order to be better prepared for the next round.

Very interesting mechanics and 2 different games (solo and teams) in one package.

When I played this for the first time, out of the four of us, two of us absolutely hated it and two of us loved it. I hated it -- so much so that I gave it to one of my friends on the spot, and asked that it never darken my game table again.

The rules were either horribly written or horribly translated (or both!), the game is poorly designed (though, in fairness, quite pretty), and the gameplay is thoroughly average. It is teh suck.

One play with 6 players (3 teams). 

Amazed by the game.
1. Designer is able to pack a light *wargame* into a deck of cards.
2. Several interesting and fun mechanics (afew of those are similiar to Taj Mahal).
3. Fun and engaging.
4. Nice theme.

I guess its better not to treat this game as a filler just because its a deck of cards. If Days of Wonder publishes this, it could be as chrome up as Shadows over Camelot. Unlike Shadows over Camelot, I feel if its published with miniatures, more people would probably give it a better opinion.

Seriously considering buying this game. :)

Quickly becoming a favorite.  I love good 2v2 games and I think this is the best I've found yet.  Trojan War-themed card game.  Several types of cards with which to battle opponents.

This card game has beautiful artwork on high quality cards. It's also easy to explain (but a bit challenging to understand) and plays quickly. Challenging hand-management is limited by card draw, which increases the luck factor for this game. My wife and I play with a house rule (at least for 2 player game): between rounds, each player draws 5 cards and keeps 3, as opposed to simply drawing 3 cards per instructions. This house rule allows players in a 2 player game to adapt their strategy and replenish their hand with necessary cards. Strategy goes up and luck goes down. This takes the game beyond simple "luck of the draw and do the best you can". Some games simply cannot be won, regardless of player skill or hand management, if your card draw is poor. After all, it doesn't matter if you have 12 elphants, if you've got no Hoplites or Archers to put on them :)

The cards and components are very nice.  This game does a good job of capturing the feel of the period.  The mechanics mesh well.

Between 12/10/06 and 07/08/15 I've played 13 times; five five-player games, one four-player game, and seven three-player games. 
The mechanics remind me a little of the card play in Taj Mahal and Ivanhoe. Nice art work. Though I don't understand the theme. What are the players supposed to be? Are we all Greeks fighting amongst ourselves beneath the walls of Troy? Why aren't we killing Trojans? And elephants? There were no elephants at the siege of Troy!

Surprisingly wonderful game!  Fast turns, lots of decisions, and a nice amount of depth.  Great production values. A little clunky to teach at first, but once you're underway, things fall into place very logically.  There are a few rule nuances, but nothing too tricky.  I really like the varying victory parameters per round (seige).  It keeps the tactical decisions short and pointed, while the overall goal keeps your eye on the big picture victory.  A great way to introduce a little "warfare" into a non-wargamer group.

This is Condottiere in reverse. Whereas the former has runaway leader issues, the latter has runaway loser issues. What is it with this designer? I think he designs really good games, and yet for me, they suffer greatly from the issues highlighted.
To be frank, I think I am not suited to his games, which leaves me a frustrated player.always wanting more, yet never really enjoying the experience. 

After a few more plays..had to revise down this game.Sorry...for me a dreadful gaming experience.

RATING: 8
Some of the best "tough" decisions ever.  How far do you push yourself each round, knowing that the more you push, the worse off you'll be in future rounds?  These kinds of decisions have always made me feel like winning (or losing) has been my fault, even though there is a small amount of luck involved.  Lots of politics and truces/enemies made; really feel like you're at war in that respect. Also lots of attempts to keep your motives/plans a secret, which makes it feel meta-gamey.
One thing I don't like, however, is for how simple the game really is (feels like an elaborate version of rock-paper-scissors with points), it seems to take a while to explain, although maybe that's just me.
Overall, really like.  Plays teams, too, which is always a bonus for me.

A fairly clever card game of knowing when to fight and when to fold.  Seems like it belongs in Knizia's family of games such as Beowulf, Taj Mahal, and Ivanhoe.  All of those games have a similar notion of hording cards in hopes of outlasting your opponent during a key battle.  There is also a little element of rock, paper, scissors with each card having specific abilities against another type of unit.  My ranking might go up with more plays.

An improvement upon Condottiere.  Innovative rock/paper/scissors/flame/air combat mechanism (to paraphrase Scott DiBerardino).  I like the use of the Oracles quite a bit.  The rulebook isn't as clear as it could be, but the game is simple enough that it all gets sorted out pretty quickly.  Gorgeous art on the cards, as befits an Asmodee production. Yes, one has to wonder what elephants have to do with the Trojan War and why Nestor--Nestor???--is the strongest of the heroes.  But the game is good enough that these niggles disappear quickly.

Only played the six-player teams. Would like to play with four.

It's a pretty good game - only if you are playing in teams, or two-players. Because of its conflict nature, plays with more than three players are very chaotic and may suffer from kingmaking or retaliation between players. However, for co-operative play it's definitely an underrated gem as a more refined strategy can be formed, and it's less chaotic.

ILIADE - Gioco di carte tutto sommato molto carino. Il gioco è completamente indipendente dalla lingua, e grazie a dei simboli sulle carte, gli effetti e benefici sono facilmente comprensibili già dalle prime partite. Non ho provato la versione a 2 o a squadre che comunque mi hanno consigliato, in 4/5/6 però ho trovato il gioco piacevole e sicuramente non banale. I disegni sulle carte sono efficaci e anche l'ambientazione dell'assegio è ben rappresentata. Visto il prezzo è un titolo che non escluderei...

RATING: 5.5
Better with two than any larger number, although it does make an intriguing concept at pairs. I don't immediately see why the rules need to be specially adapted for a 2-player game - the basic rules stand up OK with minimal tweaking. A bit of a faff in that you need to be instantly familiar with all the cards before playing, but definitely a game with long-term potential.

I like the design, the balance, the choices one has available, and the length of the game. It's quite "Knizian" in its design, and I mean that as a compliment. 

There is some feel to the theme, too, which is a plus--namely, in how some cards can be played on top of others and how certain cards function in the game. That it can accommodate up to 6 seems to be a plus, too. 

I have the French-language edition, but the cards are easily identifiable by illustration and even wording (e.g.,- "Armee," "Hoplite," and "Elephant"). The English language rules are not particularly well translated and are too wordy, but in general the intended meaning is clear. The quickie "Rules Summary" sheets available on BGG are also helpful for reference. 

I like this a lot even though I'm not usually a fan of strategy card games, although some I've played, like "Kwa-Do," "Battle Line," "Lightning: Midway," or "Battle for Hill 218" hold up well in my experience. 

The more I play this game the more I like it--that is, once I've played enough to pretty much memorize how the cards work, it really shines. I do find the variance of opinion about this game interesting, and therefore I'd encourage people wanting to know more about the game to read the range of opinions, high, low, and in between.

I thought Iliad was fairly ordinary, and I wasn't inspired to add it to my collection or play again. It went way past its bed-time, and there was not much special you could do, no hook to hang your hat on and say, right, let's hang around and play this more. It came down to a guessing game. Firstly have they got what it takes to beat me, and secondly, will they bother this turn. Or in other words, will they king make against me or king make for me. You either guess right (good) or wrong (very very painful). Therefore not a lot of satisfaction either from the result or the game play itself.

Good group game of hand-management where players are fighting a series of "sieges" for victory point cards, with some direct interaction. Negotiation is encouraged. I wish I grew up with a game like this, and had a group that could play this regularly. I really liked the feel of this game. My wife would rather play Smash Up or Omen, though.

Okay 2-player; best with more.

Interesting game play especially when paired. Usage of cards must be planned properly or you'l find yourself losing out towards the end. Also while gameplay might have a little luck depending on what you draw, I find that it conforms to the elements of warfare where the adage goes like this "no plan ever survives contact with the enemy". 

I like how tense this game can get when you are planning your siege. Should you hold out or play it all in an effort to get that 3 point card and more so if its a victory that will secure you either Athena or Posiedon? Should you play a delaing tactic and wait for what your opponents will do even though it will cost you vital cards or just simply lay it all out in hopes that no one will attack your hoplites. 

Plyable in an hour with about 4 people. This game is one of the best I've bought in 2006

A compact version of Condotierre.  There's that same tension about whether to fight the battle or just let it pass, and the same panic when someone gets close to the magic number of victory points

Unlike Condotierre, Iliade can produce a one-turn, come-from-behind winner that no one expected.  With the combination of the City/Naval leader points, the Winner-of-the-Previous battle points, and the card that's won from the battle, severe swings in fortune can happen, and that's what keeps this game fresh.

One of the more complex card games I've played, with beautiful cards, and fun theme. Still, the balance seemed a bit off with 3 players. Perhaps a bit too complex for it's own good, or too luck based. Probably better in teams. 

Update: Second time I played it's more fun with 4 people. Gorgon sieges are too much luck based.

Update: Playing with 2 3-player teams was too imbalanced. If one team won twice in a row, victory is almost certain. This game just seems too chaotic to be much fun.

This card game provides definite challenges for the players.  You receive 12 cards that will be augmented with three (3) more at the end of a hand.  It is possible to run out of cards and use turns to rebuild your hand.  You win by being the first to a set number of points.  The challenge is knowing when fight to get the points you need.

Good application of theme. Simple yet aggressive mechanics reflect the theme well.  Game Strategy and hand management are a light medium to maybe medium depending on your competition.  Quick play.  It deserves a higher rating, but I would only give it one if I was better at doing running totals in my head.

It suffers From dog-piling and runaway leaders when played by three.  Two player variant is good stuff, Four or Five may be okay, and Six is a different variant.  Four also has variant to make battles of pairs of players, which might be better.

A straight-forward, take-that, type of game, complicated by lots of card interactions. Not all these interactions are captured on the cards so the first plays are a bit fiddly. Nothing new here, but works OK. Team game is probably more interesting. The card draw is fairly random, so the game relies on well-applied leader hitting to kep things in check.

Play went slightly better than I expected with moderate tactical depth for this light/medium card game. Seems like an ok filler game with some meat on it but seems to lack tension and game flow is average in my view.

At first you may think it's all about luck of the card draw. After a few games you realize that there are many things you need to consider during the game. If you get a bad hand then you just have to take some hits and try to recover during the following rounds. You can't win every round so that's why timing is crucial. You need to know when to pass. You need at least one majority token, so you have to get the right victory cards, it's just not about victory point values of cards. Your attack cards are often very limited , so you have to know who to hit and when. You should keep your head cool all the time and never seek for revenge. You should also roughly calculate how many cards of each type has been played already, so that you can take advantage of playing certain cards(for example: many catapults were played last round , so it's quite safe to play a trojan horse now). So sometimes you have to wait for opportunities to arise .I feel that after every game I find deeper and deeper aspects of Iliad even though the gameplay seems simple. I find that something very unique in a rather fast paced card game. I feel that like Iliad more and more after each play.

In spite of hopeless play on my part, I'm more than willing to try again. Similar in some ways to Ehrhard's Condottiere but better, smoother and slightly more complex.

**Played twice more with better results. if you get too involved in slugfests, you'll lose: knowing when to reserve and when to play out your hand is the key. I think you need to do some counting of the more rarely-occurring cards too for best results. I'd like to try the team version with 4 or 6 players.

RATING: 7
Iliad is a quick card game where players assemble an army to besiege Troy, with rewards offered for the strongest armies.  The first player to gain 12 victory points wins the game.  The game consists of a few decks of cards: victory cards, hero cards, oracle cards, and army cards.  The game starts with each player being dealt a hand of 12 cards, hero cards are laid out according to the number of players, the victory deck is shuffled and the top 1 - 3 cards are revealed (based on the number of players), and finally the oracle deck is shuffled and the top card is revealed.  The oracle deck determines which type of siege the players are engaging in; they are either fighting in a simple one-upmanship contest (Gorgon) where the player who has the strongest army at the start of his turn wins, or a full siege (Thanatos) that only ends when all players pass.  At the end of every siege the winner gets his pick of victory cards and the first player marker (which is worth 1 victory point), and if it is a Thanatos siege the next strongest gets to choose next, until the weakest army takes the Thanatos card, which is worth negative victory points.

Each turn players may play a card from their hand onto the table, or choose to attack an opponent (usually with one of their units already on the table), or pass, which in a Thantos siege grants them the strongest available hero for that siege.  The unit cards each have a strength, and like a game of rock-paper-scissors some cards can kill other cards.  Other cards are support cards which help your army or offer defense against attacks.  While there are no limits to the number of cards players can play in a siege players will only draw 3 cards between sieges, thus players must manage not only the current siege but future sieges.

The game is straightforward, and the math in adding up an army's strength is not taxing.  The aspect of only drawing 3 cards per turn, with a hand limit of 12, helps to balance against strong hands.  Furthermore, players will see the victory points available per siege and decide how many of their cards a particular siege is worth.  The game is light, but the strategy is present, especially as players posture and cautiously build armies.

RATING: 6
I found this to be a somewhat interesting hand management game where you are required to be selective in the battles you pursue as you will never have enough to pursue them all effectively.  Unfortunately, like many members of this genre, your effectiveness is limited by the cards in your hand.  Since these cards are randomly dealt to you, you are left to do what you can with what you are dealt.  This is alleviated somewhat by the higher bonus cards for passing early, but this is really a miniscule compensation given the non-trivial penalty for fielding the smallest force.  So, if you catch a run of cards without many hoplites, chariots, and/or archers, you can expect a rather long and uninteresting game.  I guess I should mention at this point that knowing the card distribution would be a great boon, especially as the number of players increases.  The other general failing of these types of games is that for the game to really work, everyone has to play in a reasonable manner.  Poor play can take many forms, from emptying ones hand to ignoring the leaders (either in a given siege or overall).  In respect to sieges, ignoring the leader is actually encouraged by the Thanatos cards.  The final problem is that this game takes way too long for what it is.  It feels like a game that should take 30 minutes to play with 45 minutes being excessively long.  My five player game lasted an hour and a half.  Ouch!  Still, there is enough interesting going on that I would be willing to play again if asked, particularly a partnership game which I hear is where this game really shines.  [10/18/2007]

Marvelous and fun.  Superior in every way to its predecessor, "Condottiere".  It's a bit of a pain to teach because, like Chess, each card has a laundry list of abilities.  However, none of these concepts are difficult, and it all holds together quite intuitively once you start.  Yes, there are mild imbalances (i.e. Harrows don't seem very useful because people hate wasting Chariots on attacks), but in actual practice any advantage gained is negligible next to solid bluffing and tactics.

A little overly complex for the amount of game play that the game offers.  Clearly this is a labor of love, and time and thought was poured into it, but the results just left me feeling that it is full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  I like the mechanics of they system (which are similar to one of my own designs).  Did I mention the art is beautiful. 

All in all I just felt that there was too much going on and because of this, there was no way to accurately make predictions of how the game plays out. As a result you just go with your gut and make a stab what you think will work out, hoping that other people don't screw you in the meantime.  

Yes, it is interactive, but you are given a hand that either works well or doesn't and you play what you have.  The big decision in this game is knowing when to pull out, which is fine; but because you are so constrained by your draw I feel that this is more a decision than what cards you play, which is not fine.

The art is great though.  My biggest problem with this game is rather silly.  If everyone knows about the function of the Trojan Horse then it isn't much of a surprise.  It's just stupid that there are more than one of them.

Thematically, this game doesn't make much sense.  Why are multiple players attacking each other in Troy?  This would make more sense if it were based on The Hobbit's Battle of Five Armies or the Peloponnesian War.

Love it, love it, love it! Some people I've played it with have refused to ever look at it again, but a group of three other people and I will sit down and usually play four or five games in a row, and these are forty-five minute games, so it's not really filler. 
Great game.

Clearly related to Condotierre, this also reminds me of Havoc in the way you play for VP cards and how you play cards one at a time building your army strength -- same elements of hand management and bluffing. This game adds some take-that in the form of allowing you to attack cards in others' armies.

After one play (5er), this has too much screwage for us to play as a couple! Also, it _seems_ as if luck of the draw can be too important (only draw 3 cards each turn), but that's hard to say for sure after just one play. Probably better with 3, or with the partnership rules.

Rules:
- n players get x cards (varies with player number)
- Place n Heroes in display, valued 1-n. When players drop out of battles, if they have an army they take the highest valued Hero still available (adds to army strength). Heroes returned to table after each battle.
- Place the 3 tiles on the table. They are worth 1VP, 2VP, 2VP and go to the siege winner, most city-VPs, and most trireme-VPs player after each battle.
- Game ends the instant someone gets to VP target.

Each turn:
- Reveal as many VP cards as (#players - 2). These are either cities or triremes worth 1-3VP, or Helen of Troy worth 5VP.
- Reveal battle card: either Thanatos (6/8) or Gorgon (2/8). If Thanatos, play till all pass; choose VP cards in order of strength; penultimate gets nothing; worst gets Thanatos card (-1 or -2 VP). If Gorgon: play till one player at START of turn has strongest army; battle ends and that player takes a VP card.
- On your turn, you may play a card or pass. Once you've passed, you're out for the remainder of the round (siege).
- Battle winner gets the 1VP tile. Then check for city-VP totals, then trireme-VP totals. Resolve IN ORDER since game ends immediately if someone's VP total reaches the target.
- At end of battle, all played cards are discarded. Deal 3 new cards to each player. 
- Repeat.

Good pub game.  Multi player Battle Line with a lot more chaos.  I'm thinking I might prefer Condottierre at this point, but that may simply be because I've played the latter more frequently (12/06/09)

[Asmodee English 2006 edition] {Novel; bidding, hand management, utility cards; optimal 4-5p} {basic game 6.50} Iliade is thematic card game. It's engaging and fun.  Its mechanics are quite interesting. It takes some times to teach the rule and players need a few turns to understand the function of each card.

I like the games that require players smartly decide when to withdraw - if you played too many cards this round, you can win but you lost the initiatives in later rounds. And, Iliade is a very good one in this genre. That's why it is very tactical, in which you have to make best use of the cards in hand.  

The illustration of the cards fits the theme nicely and is attractive. 2 player aids are provided but I would love more aid cards.

I haven't tried the team play yet.  Looking forward to the team play.

Great mid-light Battle game. Far better than others of it's kind such as Ivanhoe. Great quality cards and artwork potrays the Trojan theme wonderfully, even if there weren't Elephant's actually used in Troy.

The intracies of when to use each of the 8 Army card types takes 2 or 3 games to appreciate but makes for intriguing offensive and counter offensive combinations once fully understood. The different battle types and the heros card add further interest to to game. I prefer randomly selecting from all the heroes which is a variant I created.

RATING: 7
Rating after only a partial game.  The rules as written made this sound harder than it really is. This is actually not a difficult game but there is some depth here.  The card interactions are interesting and I like the trade-off's between offensive and defensive play.  Do you improve your army's strength or its value?  Do you set up to attack another player or do you play to defend against attack?  At what point do you stop playing cards and hope your army is good enough?  Lots of interesting decisions.

This game has many similarities with Condottiere, though I think this one is a little more streamlined: there is more balance in the battles, and though the powerful cards can be "killed" by other cards (with and Archer of value 1, ou can kill an Hoplite with value of 4, but that is the way of war) this doesn't have the same impact and the weaker cards can became more powerful (if one use them in a phalanx, or above and elephant, but this also attracts unwanted attention! What to do?!).

Overall, it is a fun and well made game, with great art and many things to think about and decisions to made.

Solid gameplay. Balanced card combination generates sort of paper-rock-scissors thinking style. Various Orcales lead to various card management tactics. Three Gods make the game more dynamic, and offer both short-term and long-term planning. The play-before-use mechanic makes the game less take-that, but offers a sense of threat in game.
Fantastic Roman artwork. Very appropriately themed. Elegant packing. Detailed rulebook. Smooth gameplay. Game length is just right. Suitable for 3P, 4P, and teamed games. Not too difficult. Fun game moments.

Although there are some interesting mechanics regarding army building/scoring, combat is basically a rock/paper/scissors/lizard/Spock trump game.  And anyway, usually a player's available cards seem to hinder more than help.  I really wanted to like this game but Iliad feels incomplete (i.e. it needs something more) and isn't fun.

RATING: 6
There's certainly a game here.  It appears to be highly tactical, rather than strategic.  Long-term planning is basically "do I keep this card for the next round, or play it now."  It's not overly complicated, but I'm not sure I'll ever play it enough to get deep into it, or good at it.

Nice, quick game of one-upsmanship that is simple, yet works.  Lots of similarities here to [gameid=112], particularly with the multiplayer majority wins.  Unlike Condotierre, however, there is a gradation for placement, which makes things much more interesting.  The theme here is abstract, almost laughable, particularly in light of the fact that you are simulating a two-sided battle with more than two players.  But despite that, the art is good though ahistorical (elephant wut?), and the game mechanics work in isolation, so the game works anyway.

This reminds me of Munchkin, direct interaction where you try to hit the leader and you never know how many points you or the others will have at the end of the round until the round ends.

RATING: 4
This is an interesting design, and I think it has some potential, but I also feel like this is just an elaborate Take That! type of game.  In my first game, I drew lots and lots of defensive cards, but very few offensive cards, and ended the game with 1 point.  I didn't take any negative points, but I kept ending up with third place, meaning I didn't take ANYthing.  As a result, every offensive card I drew after the first hand were within the three I drew at the end of each round, and I kept drawing fewer and fewer of them.  I'll play it again, but I don't think this is quite my thing.

But once Rick started explaining the rules,  I warmed up a little bit - it sounded like the "card game" was hidden by lots of rock-paper-scissors interactions.  Reading reviews indicate that this might be best played as a partnership game,  which would be a pity since not many games play 2-6.

[b]SOLID AND CONSISTENTLY ENJOYABLE.[/b]

Glorious artwork and theme reflecting the Trojan war is plastered all over the cards and the other good-quality game components. Some care was bestowed upon this small production and it shines through; after myriad plays, my set of army cards are still in fine condition.

The gameplay is a wonderful blend of screwage and brinkmanship: you have to decide which battles to fight and how hard to press your luck, especially in games with 4+ players. If a battle is turning ugly, you also need to have the skill to decide when to cut your losses and quit, licking your wounds and regrouping for a later conflict - a quality you will have to master to win.

Some strategies take a few plays to become evident, like most card games, and the same could be said for deciding which goals to aim for points-wise. The difference in the two types of siege is also quite dramatic; I really like the sudden death gameplay of the Medusa sieges - very heart pounding if you're close to winning.

Iliade plays swiftly straight from the tiny box, and is also quick to learn, once players get to grips with the icons on the cards; though they are considerably easier wrap your gamer-brain around than Race FT Galaxy.

The game structure is different for 2 players, but this does not detract from the enjoyment of a 2-player battle one whit. In fact, I would argue that the strategy involved in two-player duels are subtly more involving than larger scale skirmishes, in a manner that brings to mind Poker. A handful of cards are debatably more powerful, or more useful, with two: the Trojan Horse cards are a prime example of this. Another asset of this cardgame is that it scales smoothly from 2 to 6 players, with no discernable wobble or sweetspot - all matchups are frantic and jolly good fun.

After a mediumweight time-investment of plays, about 100 games, I can say with some assuredness that my eagerness to play this game has not diminished. In fact, my respect for Iliade builds upon each playing.

1. Not always a great theme-to-card fit.

This game is vicious.  Everything is dying all the time... you never have as many cards as you want... and delaying to see what your opponents (or partner) does is almost never a real option.  This makes for a pretty tense fun game that is particularly interesting when playing with partnerships.  There might not be as much bluff here as I was expecting, but finding the best way to utilize your cards to put yourself ahead of the pack without wasting all your strength for the next round makes for some really great decision points.

We did not play to completion in our first attempt at this.  Apparently we got a couple of rules wrong and everybody just decided not to continue nor to start over (which is a bad sign in my opinion).  The 6-player team aspect was interesting, as well as how the points are scored.  The army unit designs were passable, mostly it felt like a very simple paper-rock-scissor mechanic.  Not terrible, but wasn't anything special either.

Quite a bluffing game!  Indeed, team play is quite an interesting way to play this fine game!

I love the artwork, and the gameplay is pretty brutal to boot.

Twanging a ruler on the table edge when a ranged attack is made increases the fun factor to 10.

Nice variation on the card combat theme from Condottierre and Taj Mahal. Seems a little fiddly but I only played once (and lost :( )

Had a weird feeling, but would need some more plays to be sure of this game.

Card battling game similar to Condotierre.

It's hard to say whether it's better or worse. I prefer the card refreshing mechanic in Iliad, but I found the game plowed through the Oracle cards too quickly. It also seemed that the penalties hurt a bit too much.

On the plus side, there is more direct player interaction in Iliad (for good or bad) and it's slightly quicker than Condotierre.

I'll have to try this with 4 or more players and with the team-play rules to make a final judgment.

The theme is cool, but the game itself is a bit too luck dependend to my taste. If you have bad cards and happen to be in the wrong spot on the wrong time, you can be out of the game in one or two rounds without you being able to do anything about it. 
Furthermore, the endgame can drag on forever, so while one or two players have to wait, the other players can still go on for half on hour or more...

This one was fun! Move your gangsters around the table to get into position to shoot or stab your competition or to earn money next turn. Player elimination will definitely happen in this game, so if yuor group doesn't like that, stay away. The game actually becomes more strategic as it goes on as there are fewer gangsters you have to figure out where to place your guys (and your cake!) to have the greatest effect. Very fun.

RATING: 7.5
Fun for the entire family!

p: very entertaining diversion from our normal fare, better with more players, and for once I don't even care it's an elimination game. It is possible for a player to get hold of a profitable combination of seats they are hard to remove from though, especially later in the game when the table gets less crowded. That drawback is possibly also what makes this a much better elimination game than most, as there is much more to the frantic play and seat swapping that ensues from the word

An annoying game to play because of its strong last man standing-principle... although admittedly the author managed to create a good thematic ridicule of a meeting between mobsters. I particularly liked the exploding cake which can move back and forth across the table until it explodes at a completely different spot you had originally intended.

The game is, as I indicated, an elaborate last man standing-affair. Mobsters kill each other in various ways, while attempting to remain at the table long enough to cash in on various activities to such an extent that they end up with more cash than the competition. There is no opportunity for shrewd play here; it's more of an activity. What I particularly disliked was the difficult overview which made it hard to spot the proper mobsters to carry out hits with; and that you were basically limited to cards in your hand dictating where you could enact what. Not a game I intend to replay anytime soon, in any case. But as I said, the subject matter is well done, and for that I am a bit lenient with my rate.

This is game is best at the end of a long gaming session. Shoot, stab, poison or blow up the other players and get rid of some frustrations and unsettled disputes... With a smile!

That way you can look past the issues this game has (broken endgame, randomness, etc.)

RATING: 7
Good clean family fun. Try to kill all the other players. This is not a deep strategy game; it is a fun family game in the vein of Guillotine. Very light but fun nonetheless. You play mobsters sitting around a table knocking each other off. Guns, knives, poison and exploding cakes that can take out 3 at a time are the weapons used. There is a lot of seat shuffling as everybody tries to get the valuable chairs or get out of the way of the exploding cakes. Did I mention it was fun.

Not sure what to think of it. It's more a beer and pretzel game and we started of with this one. 
I think it does what it sets out to do and the fixed setup probably is recommended.
I will play this again as a beer and pretzel game or a family game.

Bada bing!!  "Keep your friends close, but you're enemies closer."  :D  Whack your mafia friends at Don Pepe's Italian restaurante.  Put on your best italian accent for this light party game where you try to win by making the most money before your gang get "whacked".  Best with five or six...

An OK game, especially if players get into tho spirit of it.  However, the fact that it's an elimination game is a bit of a drawback.  If you're looking for a mafia-themed game, this one is miles ahead of Mayfair's "Family Business"!

RATING: 5
Luck based take-that card game. Each player has a bunch of mobsters sitting at a large table. Some places give you money each turn, other places help you kill other mobsters - but only on certain positions and only if you have the right cards. The idea is to kill mobsters sitting in the places you want your mobsters to sit, and then move to that space. Game ends when all the money is gone, or there's only one player with mobsters left, who then takes all the remaining money. Most money wins.

There's some strategy in positioning and fighting over the right spots, but you're pretty much at the mercy of the cards. If you don't have anything to kill mobsters with, you end up skipping turn after turn, until you can finally do something again. Another problem is that the game starts fun, with a full table and lots of killing opportunities (I must mention the exploding cakes that can be moved around the table, those are great) but when there's only a couple of mobsters left, some players will already be out of the game, and the rest isn't making much money (thus not bringing the game closer to an end) and hasn't many opportunities to kill one another, so the game really drags. At that point it's just waiting until you draw the right card and your opponents don't draw cards to counter it. This makes the game last much longer than it should. Otherwise, not such a bad game.

I had fun with this game for a while, but found that it dragged as you got to the end of the game, as there were fewer bodies to make money, and the ending condition of running out the bank seemed miles away. I did like it more than Family Business, and it's similar in feel and theme, but more fun.

This sports a wonderful mobster theme and cutthroat game mechanics, both of which work well in tandem (players who seek to avoid conflict in their gaming experience should avoid this at all costs). Players don't have a heck of a lot of control, however, and not drawing movement cards can be a severe disadvantage, knocking my rating down a peg.

Don Pepe looked like a clever party game but alas, it was not to be.  There are few meaningful choices to be made.  It's a Parker Brothers title that lies so outside of its comfort zone that I hate to criticize.  It was a gutsy effort.

En este pequeño juego trenzado, los jugadores toman el control de una banda de mafiosos que se dedican a extorsionar dinero de empresas y borrando las turbas que compiten en el proceso. Todos los miembros de la banda se sitúan en torno a una mesa oblonga, con algunos de los lugares que indican ciertos beneficios. Si un lugar tiene una imagen de una empresa, entonces el jugador gana dinero hasta que el mafioso se mata o se mueve. Si el lugar tiene un arma, entonces él puede usarlo para disparar un mafioso encima de la mesa. Si un lugar tiene un cuchillo, entonces él puede utilizarlo para apuñalar a alguien sentado junto a él. Además, algunos de los mafiosos tienen la capacidad de matar a otros todo el tiempo mediante la realización de sus propios cuchillos y armas de fuego. El juego termina cuando se toma todo el dinero disponible, y el más grande pila de efectivo toma el juego.

Los mafiosos sentados alrededor de la mesa intentarán desacerse de los adversarios. La posición en la que están trae beneficios. Libro=ingresos / Pistola=Disparar al frente / Cuchilla = herir al vecino. Además hay cartas que otorgan otras habilidades.

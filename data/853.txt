One playing with six players.  It seemed to end too quickly (after only three rounds) and I wonder if I would have enjoyed it more if there was a few more rounds?  It is a nice little game, but one which I won't be asking to play.  I wouldn't mind trying it again with fewer players because I find myself wanting to like this game.

A very good trick taking game which we really should play more often.  Who knew Martin Wallace did card games too?  Going by this one (and I'm not aware of any others?) he should do more (though cards often feature as one of the parts of his 'bigger' designs).

Very random - if you get great cards, you are practically guaranteed a win - but there are some basic strategies, a few of which I only realised towards the end of my 1st game.

I'm worried that this game may not have enough to offer after a few more games but for now, I could see myself enjoying it a few times consecutively.

RATING: 6.5
Clever card game where players are competing to win scoring cards each turn. There are only n-1 scoring cards though (n is the number of players), so someone will come up short. The bidding is done similar to how the bidding works for the second part of For Sale (selling properties for checks). The lowest bidding player takes the lowest valued scoring card--which could be negative! Play continues until all the scoring cards are claimed, with the second-place player receiving nothing for that turn.

Do I like this more than For Sale? Yes, there's more luck. But also more fun, it seems. When compared to the processional, almost mechanical bidding of For Sale, the psych-out, double-think of Und Tschuss is a far more entertaining auction block. Homemade, using Flinch cards.

A filler game played with Steven of the Spiel

RATING: 7
The deck consists of 104 cards, with values ranging from 1-15 with some -5 and -10 cards as well. Everyone is dealt a hand of cards. Cards are then laid out on the table so that there is one less card than the number of players. The cards on the table are the point cards you are playing for. Everyone picks a card from their hand and puts it face down in front of them. When all cards are down, they are flipped and the lowest card takes the lowest face up card as points and is out for the round. The remaining players add a card, simultaneously, to the card already down in front of them. Cards are totaled and the lowest total takes the lowest remaining point card. This continues until there are two players left, at which point the highest point total gets the remaining card and the 2nd place person gets... nothing! 

Calculating and manipulating when to go out is at the heart of the game. There could be few points found in going out early (even minus points), but you risk even fewer points if you stay in. The weakness is that if you get a bum hand, it is hard to improve it since you only replace the cards that you've played, so if you continue to draw low cards you might be going out early a lot. Aside from that, though, there are some nice choices in anticipating what others will play and going out at the right time.

Passable card game that may have had marginal interest at the time of its release, but has been rendered completely irrelevant now. Probably the main draw is that it's a Wallace design. But is that really a draw?

RATING: 8.5
very simple, but you need to think and plan depending upon the card you hold so you dont get left with a poor scoring card or no score at all !very quick game so nice to fit in when you've not much time or at the end of a games evening to finish things off.

LIKES:

* Clever little card game by Martin Wallace.
* Plays in 5-10 minutes.
* Is easily taught and understood in less than 5 minutes.
* Fun little mechanism where everyone lays down a card and the lowest card gets the lowest point card.  Everyone but that person lays another card down, sums their laid cards together, and the lowest sum takes the next lowest score card.  This continues until two people remain and then the final and highest score card is won by the person who has the highest sum.

DISLIKES:

* There is a LOT of randomness in the card draw for both the score cards and the hand draw.  Plays quickly enough that it isn't an issue.  You may want to play several games and total the scores to even out luck of the draw.

Fun game by Martin Wallace in his younger days. I didn't know he produced this lighter kind of stuff as well. It is very enjoyable, the mechanism reminds me of For Sale. I was playing at Martin's booth in Essen '09 when a Japanese guy stopped by to hand Martin some new copies of the japanese edition of Und Tschüss! I reacted immediately and could buy one copy from the Japanese, who of course had to have his picture taken with me. I am now besides Martin himself probably the only white person with a copy of the Japanese only edition.

RATING: 6
Hmmm... I fond it interesting to see a comment that the game works best with all 6 players. As Bobby4th says, with this many, the game ends after 3 rounds, meaning the luck factor plays a huge role. If there were twice as many cards, I think the game would work better (or maybe playing through the deck a couple of more times would help?). I'd like to try it with 4 and 5 to see what difference it makes. It's not a great game, but I enjoyed it well enough and it reminded me of For Sale quite a bit.

When Surya explained the rules, I kinda liked the idea; But when playing it, I found it very frustrating to play; For example you can play 15, 15 & 14, but if your opponent has a triple 15, you have nothing and you've lost all your high cards. It's also hard if you have mediocre cards and can't become the first player to get a card so that you can swap your cards.

Fun little game! There's luck in the card draw, of course, but there are still some decisions to make. It's yet another fine little filler! I may look for it, of just use a Sticheln deck to play it!

--- Summary ---
The deck has some negative cards (-5, -10), and a lot of positive numbers (1-15). Players each get the same number of cards (varies with player number). Reveal n-1 cards. Players then each play a card. The player with the lowest sum of all cards they played so far adds the lowest value card to your score pile. Unless it's the last card -- in that case, the player with the HIGHEST sum wins the card. Shuffle all cards except those in score piles and repeat the above, playing twice through the deck. The player with the highest sum wins!

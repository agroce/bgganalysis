A pleasant little area control game for 3, if I liked area control games I'd like this more :)

RATING: 6
I liked it, but pretty much un-winnable unless you make it really mathy at the end.  If I played again, I would definitely keep the money hidden.  A mean game, but by no means as breezy to play as it would seem.

Traded away.

RATING: 8
A clever game of auctions and area control.  Money is very tight and taking loans is a progressively worse option.  The rule whereby the player with a single cube in an area wins it in the event of a 3-3-1 tie promotes some clever placements.  I've played with two and three players.

{1 play, 4 players} Not as dry as I thought it'd be, but still pretty thinky.  Actually we played this one *without* trying to think too much, which was good, 'cause the game isn't really "chewy" enough to warrant a lengthy play time, and I can't see how the endgame isn't almost always going to have some very visible kingmaker trouble... so best to not crunch too much math and just take that extra loan :)

simple rules, good looks, plays fast, decent game.  the tiebreaker rule really adds a lot.  i like the ghost player when you're playing with 3, i don't think the game is that much different with 4 though.  appreciate the die to minimize AP for upcoming auctions, although it's possible to do it anyway once the game comes to a close.  cube distribution could be a problem, but it seems there should also be ways to play around it yourself or have others do it for you.

This is one of the most underrated and underplayed games on BGG.   It is a cutthroat auction game, filled with tension, angst, and evil choices.   It is unique and unlike any other auction game out there.

I am amazed that this game doesn't have a wider following.

Plays quickly enough but left me unsatisfied, I'd like to play it with 4 and give it another shot.  Otherwise, there's a lot of luck in the lot distribution, and can nearly ruin any chance you have early.

RATING: 5
Big Shot carves out its niche as an area majority filler game.  Players bid on groups of cubes for the right to choose where they will be placed on the board.  Overall, the game was kind of odd in that often times you were bidding against someone just to deny them placements, even though you didn't really have a great place to put them yourself.  However, you couldn't do this too often since money is pretty tight and taking out loans gets painful (each loan you take out gives you less and less money, but all loans subtract 10 million from your score at the end).  I kind of felt like my success was dependent on where other people placed my cubes when I didn't win an auction, as obviously you can't win 'em all.  Overall, sort of interesting but not much here to make me want to play it all that much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
YES! Now this is MY kind of game. This is about as mean a game as you can pack into under an hour. Not only is it highly confrontational, every decision is tense and brutal.

It's such a clever design. In most auction games, there's a fair number of auctions you pass on just because they have nothing of value to you. Not so here. It's often more beneficial to place other player's cubes than your own, and even when that isn't the case, the strict rules for loaning money may force you to bid in an auction JUST to generate more currency.

On that note, having the only way to get more money be enormous loans with diminishing returns is evil in such a good way. Not only is taking a loan a tense decision for yourself, trying to force others into taking loans, or playing around their loan limit is excellent, if a little mathy.

There's a little bit of a puzzle feel in placing the cubes, in planning on which squares you want to bid on, and in trying to outbid your opponents by JUST enough that they can't raise.

I think the best thing I can say about it is: in our first game, the entire table burst out in laughter over a deliciously evil move. Yes... this is my kind of game indeed.

RATING: 5
Seems like an early ancestor of Neue Heimat. The doubler corners, the requirement to win at least two neighborhoods, and the ties to the least make the game work. To the degree that it does. The rolling to see which packet gets auctioned makes forward planning impossible. The buck-passing is way too cruel and does the game a disservice. I'd be interested in variants where there is more control over what gets auctioned and, potentially, some sort of consortium bidding. Perhaps where passers can or must make their bid available to another player.

RATING: 7
There are three big elements going on in Big Shot. First and foremost it's an auction game. The auctions and economics are confusing to put a value on, which I believe is important for auction game replay ability. The loans system is a brilliant, necessary evil. The next element is the cube placement, again Big Shot is mold breaking in the effect that you are placing your opponent's pieces. Last, the element of a ghost player is finally done correctly. Big Shot takes a lot of used concepts: loans, area control, auctions, and ghost players and presents them all in a new, original frame with no compromise to any of the mechanics. All of this in Big Shot takes about 30 to 40 minutes. It's tense, mean, and fun!

An improbable mix between El Grande and Medici. The bidding is so difficult here, mostly due to the fact that the actual price of a lot is very hard to evaluate and ultimately depends on which of your opponent is still running for it. Yes it can be chaotic, yes it can be mean, but it's still quite a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Big Shot blends auctions and area control into something that doesn't quite feel like either, especially since you can also place your opponents' cubes.

It's also rather mean, and ending the game in debt isn't uncommon. Unfortunately, the final turn is exceptionally important and can really make or break the game. Kingmaking opportunities abound. Knowing that you must prepare for that final auction is all good and well, but it's still only one of the players actually winning it and that unfortunately mars the entire experience a little. Which is a pity since I like the rest of it.

Good auction-based area-control game, that plays in 30 min and is very easy to explain.

Brutal auction game.  The economics alone are difficult, as each successive loan provides less and less cash.  It is easy to get mired in debt when you get carried away with an auction.  The clever mechanism of ties canceling each other out really makes the game, creating a very heated bidding frenzy, though still making it quite difficult to evaluate what everything is actually worth.  Aggressive fun!

A very solid filler.  I'd pull this out anytime with 3 or 4 players and about 20 minutes left in game night or while waiting for more players at the start of game night.  It's basically 18 rounds of auctions.  To win auctions you have to take loans, but loans offer diminishing returns.  Great ruleset. Reminds me a little of For Sale...I'd put it in the same category of games.

Big Shot should be my type of game. Simple rules and lots of ways to score. Unfortunately is is also an auction game so it is difficult to know what stuff is worth. In retrospect, placements with one of each color seem to be worth more, unless you have a definite scoring opportunity. Also, I would hesitate calling this an area majority game as the focus is more on having everyone else tie, then claiming  victory with fewer cubes. For me, this game doesn't do anything that For Sale doesn't do better and quicker.

Played twice, and not much interest for it from the gaming group after.

RATING: 7.1
Fast and fierce auction/area control game in which you bid for the right to place groups of cubes (which may or may not be your own) on scoring spaces. Spaces are awarded as soon as an area hits 7 cubes, with a great rule that nullifies ties, with the player with a single cube winning the space, making for some potentially cutthroat gameplay. The game's economy, which sees loans grow increasingly expensive over the course of the game, only adds to the feeling of pain. As a 30-45 minute experience, this one packs a lot of game into the play time, but it's very possible for players to play very badly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Players take part in a fixed number of auctions, where they have got to bid for groups of four squares (in random combinations of four possible colours) that have to be placed in different areas of the board. This, of course, has got to be done so that the areas with the most benefit are either dominated by the player's own colour or where all opponents tie (and thus cancel each other out). Players need to act with great discretion, because when an area has got seven squares it gets sold automatically.

Funnily, the winner isn't the player who controls the most (or bigger) areas of the board, but the player who has won the most money. This multiplies the tension in the game, because the starting sum of money is pretty small and players can only fill up the deposit by taking credits, each time with higher interest - at the end of the game it's already quite a success not to be in the red.

The fact that Big Shot was pulled from Ravensburger's roster and has since then become a relatively obscure game is a real pity - while the three pillars of the game (auctioning, area control, money management) are well known to the average board game connaisseur, here they're interlocked with the usual Alex Randolph panache, delivering a cutthroat game suitable both for families and for players of heavier German fare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Awesome, tense auction game where there is much more reason to bid than just set collection or budget management. A little too dependent on the random draw of cubes at the beginning (if all your cubes get paired up, you're gonna win), and it takes a bit of deep thought to work out how to maximise certain positions, but it's very much worth it.

RATING: 6
It's a series of 20 auctions, each auction is of 4 coloured cubes (randomised). Each player is trying to get their colours onto the board onto the 13 regions so that they have a majority in regions. Regions score from 21 down to 9, so if you win an auction, you tend to place your colours in the high regions, and place opponent's cubes in either low scoring regions, or regions where they can't get the majority (max 7 cubes per region) or try and produce ties - as all cubes in ties are deemed worthless.

Which led to some interesting auctions for example when 1 of each colour was up for auction and there was a region which had 3 different cubes in it. If the player who was unrepresented in the region won the auction and placed all those cubes in that region, there would be 1 of his and 2 of everyone else. They'd get eliminated, 6 opponent's cubes would be wasted and they'd win a region with just 1 cube. Sweet!

The other interesting feature is the loan system. You start with measly 10m bucks. Each successive loan gets you one less dollar (ie 9, 8, 7) but you still have to repay back 10m for each one. After 3 or so loans, your well of easy money starts drying up - the next loan will only get you 6m and you effectively lose 4m straight away.

It's an interesting exercise in auctioneering group think, trying to work out what the average profit allowed per auction should be. Valuing at various times was tough when there weren't obvious plays / closeouts to be made. 

The auctions are fast and everyone seems to have a stake. A lot of auctions along the way seemed important as closeouts. The last auction went for the most money as you'd expect as no one can bounce back and beat what you set up with the last selection of cubes, but being in a position where you can win it without falling on your loan sword meant not winning other previous important auctions so it balanced out. A decent opener / closer all in all.

This is a fun, evil, light-weight auction game. It has the unusual property that individual auctions vary in general significance, and in significance to particular players, in an almost random way: no more steady increase or decrease in importance. Sometimes you are bidding to avert disaster, other times to make a positive play for yourself. The last auction may be a problem but I haven't played enough to know. Recommended for play with ingenious and malevolent friends!

Fun Game. Area Control/Auction game with a twist where ties are cancelled out.

The cubes are evenly split and put in random groups around the edge board. A group of four random cubes is bid on by all players and the auction winner gets to control where those cubes are placed on the board. The cube group you win might not include any of your own color! As soon as any space has 7 cubes in it, it's sold to the winner of the majority. Using this and the ties-are-cancelled majority rule allow for clever cube placement to hose the other guys out of their attempt to win the spot.

Income comes only from loans, which are increasingly more expensive as you take more loans. It makes for some pretty tough choices.

Többségi játék a régi időkből. Nekem tetszett, nincs fölöslegesen elnyújtva. A játékosok színnel jelölt kockáit a tábla körül négyes csoportokban 18 helyre véletlenszerűen kell lerakni a játék elején majd egy bábut le kell rakni valamelyik mezőre ezek közül. Ezután a kezdőjátékos dob egy kockával, majd a bábut lépteti pontosan annyit előre. Ahol megáll, ott a kockacsomagra licitálás indul, majd a győztes felhelyezi őket a táblára a belátása szerint. Amelyik negyedben eléri a kockák száma a 7-et, ki kell értékelni. A legtöbb kockával rendelkező szín nyer, egyenlőség esetén kiütik egymást a második legtöbb nyer. Szép, még a régi igényes ravensburger kidolgozás.

Played once with 4P. An auction and area control hybrid with really simple rules. What really makes this game tick is the tiebreaker rule. This particular rule makes it worthwhile to bid on lots that you have no stake in as you can still use other players' cubes to form ties and lock them out. 

The minor downsides are that the auctions feel a bit repetitive, and the starting auctions seem a little unimportant. Nonetheless, it is still a clever filler game with some brainpower involved as distributing the cubes is not as easy as it seems.

Yeah!  This may be the meanest auction game around.  I love it.  The decisions are tough, the interaction is high.  It has a little bit of a puzzle element to the placement, but with the ties going to the next player down there are a number of options to play with. 

Great with three.  I like the ghost player that you can use to foil other players plans.  The rating will most likely go up with more plays.

With four I could see problems in the game, but the white spoiler cubes make this game fantastic with three.

Lovely, vicious auction game, cruelly short on money, where players bid for the right to place cubes in regions on the board. When a region fills to seven, or at the end of the game, the region goes to the majority owner -- but ties cancel out, so you can win with 1 cube if the pattern is 3/3/1 or 2/2/2/1.

Probably best with three (the fourth colour is neutral), but always great.

[Ravensburger 2001 edition] {Economic, city building; auction, area-control; optimal 4p} I bought Big Shot as per Faidutti's recommendation and my interest on economic games (there are too few games using most money as the victory condition).

Big Shot does not fail me.  It is a solid game.  It's interactive, fun, thematic and highly replayable. It is already enjoyable to waste cubes of a player by throwing them to a place not useful at all.  The rule is simple and intuitive, which can be taught within 10 minutes.  The dice rolls add excitement (and luck) to the game but players still have good controls about what they can do. The fixed number of rounds makes the game end around an hour. All these are required attributes of a good family game even though it may be too confrontational.

It is not easy to design a game that determines a winner merely by the amount of cash.  But Big Shot does a good job.  The loan system is interesting.  I once saw a player get 7 loans!

I prefer playing Big Shot with the variant: keeping money secret and players can only make loan requests before an auction has started.  This makes the game faster and more challenging.

It seems to be interesting, but didn't work for my wife. Needs more plays. Brazilian version has low quality (less 0.5 points because of that).

Awesome auction/area control game. So simple, so fast, so elegant. Nothing bad to say about this game at all.

I didn't play this Alex Randolph design until 2009. What a pleasant surprise. I sort of associated Randolph's games with old-school, first-generation stuff - pioneering but now dated. Not so with Big Shot, which is a unique auction/area placement game that has flown under the radar but has the qualities of a timeless classic. The game is well balanced and the twist that you're bidding not just to place your own influence markers but possibly those of your opponents makes for agonizing decision and lively auctions. Glad I fired up the Wayback Machine to try this one out.

One of the best area control games. Simple, tense, and small placements can bring big rewards.

When I first taught Big Shot to our gaming group I had no idea how much fun it would be.  I didn't understand how limiting 7 bids in each area created an interesting puzzle in terms of game time until we actually started playing.  I want to play more of this.

Very uninspiring.  Felt like about 2/3 of a game - with a few more mechanics, might be more worthwhile.

I found the basic mechanic of grouping players' cubes and then auctioning them off really compelling, and think it should be used in another more complex game. Here it works, but as a whole the game is uninspired and leaves me with no particular desire to revisit.

Quite enjoyable auction game in which you try to win auctions that don't contain your pieces, pass on auctions that do, and everything in-between. The value of a lot changes with each bid as properties reach their "tipping point" and risk being claimed. I've played this three times with three different groups, and all of them seem stunned at how quickly the loans pile up.

Cute area majority game where you play with the other players' pieces. Good stuff.

A relatively light, quick bidding game which I mildly enjoyed. Hidden money and the variant rule about when to take loans are both needed to make this game more enjoyable.

Played several times (with 3 and 4 players). A nice auction and majority game with a twist. It is short and enjoyable enough to be worth playing occasionally. Might be better with 3 players (and a neutral one).

I'd give this another shot and hopefully be more competitive since it just didn't click the first time, but it's a bit too light and random for me. I usually like area control but the random order of cubes throws this a bit off for me. I also seemed to be setting someone up with every move I made instead of helping myself. I was completely useless this game.

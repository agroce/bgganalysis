RATING: 6
Somewhat interesting but it relies a little too much on their idiotic hidden number system that perverts a logic game into Where's Waldo that is anything but logical. Exit does a much better job at hiding information like that. This hiding system has you reading too much into various squiggles on the cards where some are actual hidden information and some are just you reading too much into other random squiggles.

Broken. The rules are some of the worst I've seen and the machines completely break their red+blue add and reveal system.

Why do i take a 2 or 3 minute penalty for putting in a 2 second door code incorrectly?

The puzzles are either childs play easy or such a stretch that you just laugh and go why is this in the game?

The climax of this one requires a mechanic that is not in the rules. Terrible.

Oh and the app has machines on it and they dont even tell you that in the rules.

A lot of fun. Of course you can only play once. The needed app is fairly unobtrusive, which is good, as I don't really like to combine my tabletop gaming with apps.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

++ Nice easier difficulty level and this one should be your starting point to the Unlock series IMO (If you only buy the first 3, but if not, start by the Tutorial, then the Elite, then this one).
++ A nice use of the App possibilities with this one (Hearing recordings).
++ A few good puzzles (2 or 3).


:thumbsup: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS FOR THIS SPECIFIC GAME:[/b]

-- There was a long series of straightforward and easy puzzles, using the combinaison mechanism.
-- This game seems to break the rules stated in the rulebook about the combinaison cards (adding a red and blue card to find a new card) for the last puzzle.

This is the very 1st escape room type of game what I tried. I enjoyed it very much. The only thing what I don't like is how hard to discover the secret items. And it is not because you are not clever enough, it is because you literally cannot see the clues.

Our first Unlock game! This one was ok, but I didn't enjoy the hidden number mechanic and it was a bit tedious shuffling through the various cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Components: Simple, clear illustrations; detailed overview maps. I really enjoy how the objects are visible from a distance on the maps, and then up close and from a different perspective on their own cards. A lot of car went into these illustrations. Elegant game system: nothing but cards and an app, and only a few types of cards.

Experience: My second “escape room” game. Lots of fun. Tough puzzles. We got stuck at one point because we didn't see a hidden number; tripped us up for a long time. The game system allows us to find clues where there aren't any; to scrutinize every detail of a card, seeing numbers and letters we aren't meant to see, revealing cards we aren't meant to reveal. So that's frustrating. But in general, the puzzles are fun and rewarding.

The Formula didn't have the same “aha” moments as The Island of Doctor Goorse, but still really good.

Took us about two and a half hours.

This did a good job of capturing the feel of an escape room, for good and for bad.  The puzzles range from blindingly obvious, to incredibly opaque (and you won't be able to solve them without using a hint).  Plus, in this case, there was one misleading card (B) and one hidden card (7) that REALLY slowed us down.  When you look at the hints, or finally solve it, you wonder "how could I have ever figured this out before?!?"

I doubt I'd do any more of these.

Disliked this more than Squeak & Sausage. We had certain expectations on how the rules worked based on Squeak & Sausage ... but nope. We did solve this one by the end but too many head-slap moments.

We also figured out two combinations that were correct numbers but were not the proper solutions to that card. Some of the puzzles were a bit of a stretch - the symbols seemed to indicate it was one type of thing, but wasn't. Blech. Even a win felt like a loss.

Reinforces my dislike of one-play games.

RATING: 9.5
That was great fun. Only feedback keeping it from a 10 was that a few logical card combos were wrong, but the numbers led to other cards that were needed later in the game. A bit more care in the numbers used to prevent cards that shouldn't be pulled from getting pulled would be recommmended. 

Minor gripe, these are great...will get all of them I am sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Zero replay value.  Not a bad thing since it is part of the design, but you should know it before you buy.  $15 is way cheaper than an actual escape room.  The combination puzzles were super easy (put the slide in the slide projector?) except for maybe 1 (Mona Lisa).  The hardest part was spotting all the hidden numbers.  And there was one bug (the two cards with vials on them should be gray).  And why don't the cards come in order if there is no rule against sorting them?  It says you can split the deck as long as you don't fan it out.

My family (wife, daughters 12, 13 yo) had a great time unlocking The Formula. The Unlock series continues to provide us with clever, logical puzzles to solve.

Having played a few Exit games prior, Unlock just didn't stand up. The experience comes across more as a point-and-click adventure game than an escape room. Additionally, the puzzles themselves are bland. Combine this with that, then combine that with this, and so on. Perhaps it is simply that the Unlock games are easier than those of the Exit series, but I was disappointed overall with the Unlock games I have tried thus far.

Acquired in Toledo Ohio August 2017.  Wow that was tough.  We failed miserably.  Didn't like it as much as Exit or Escape: the boardgames series.  Not as much puzzley clues where you are decoding like in Escape, and unlike Exit which had much more linear card clues, this had a ton of multiple cards - so too much at one time for 2 players - maybe better experience with more people so you get a bunch of eyes on all the cards and clues.  You also had to stare pretty hard at the cards - so good luck if you have bad eyesight.  Final note, the hints in the app were pretty much useless.  Liked the card driven and fully resettable system, unlike Exit system that you write on the cards and there is not re-print like Escape system.

After playing the Squeek one, I finally played this.  While I found the puzzles a bit harder, I accidentally solved a card by accident since I just played with some numbers and got a match in the deck.

This one seemed to lead you to the same place a few different ways, without any red herrings like Squeek one.

Overall, somewhat enjoyable.  

Generally, I don't care for 'escape room' type of games since the puzzles sometimes don't make any logical sense, like why would the guy put a key on a cork in a box just so that he would have to pour water in to get it every time?  Why wouldn't he have just  hidden the key somewhere?

Not a huge fan of escape rooms in general, but this was fun. My only issue with the game is that one player can dominant the play experience if they answer most/all of the puzzles.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2017)

I really like T.I.M.E Stories, so I was very keen to try the Unlock! Series of games. So far I have only played the Formula and only the tutorial :cry:. It has been hard to get the game to the table with my regular group, but I’m sure I will soon. 

I have a bittersweet feeling about the game, like T.I.M.E Stories, once you played through it, you won’t play it again because you already know the answer so it has zero replay value. At least in Space Cowboys´ games you don’t physically destroy the game, thus preserving the resale value. That’s the only reason I bought the whole series of games while I can’t buy The Exit series of games. It isn’t about the money though, I was raised in a third world country and I was always taught that you do not waste if you can avoid it so I loathe legacy style games that destroy or permanently modify the game. To me, it is immoral and unethical to create games that are disposable (even more when the designer can easily make them resettable), even if they create a great experience. Kudos to Space Cowboys for not doing this. 

From the tutorial, I think the game is best played as a 3 player game, with more, it seems too easy and players cannot experience all the cards. The tutorial was easy enough I hope the game is a lot harder.

The art of the cards is ok.

Unlock! The Formula seems like a very interesting game, I will comment more when I play through it but I´m very keen to play as many Escape Room games as I can.

Current Rating: 7.0

Unlock! The Formula is a very interesting game, and very novel (to me). Now I want to play all escape room games (the ones that don´t destroy any component).

I won´t write about the adventure itself due to spoilers, but it was a very interesting experience. The Formula in particular plays very well with two players as it isn’t very hard, however is much harder than the tutorial and I´m very happy about this. I was expecting an easier game (I´m very glad it isn’t) or perhaps I thought I was better to solve puzzles :D.

The app is very well implemented.
 
Bottom line, I really like Unlock! The Formula. Its puzzles are not very hard which is the perfect introduction to the series. It is best played as a two or three player game. I already sold my copy of the game due to its zero replayability. I already pre-ordered all the Unlock! games I could. I want to play them all.

This was our first attempt at an UNLOCK! game, so I have nothing else to really compare it to, but there was a puzzle that, even when we went back and looked at the numbers, let us flip over a card early, which messed up most of the following experience.

Not a big fan of the penalty mechanism. In a real escape room, you would be able to take a few seconds to interact and manipulate objects however you want without any penalty, whereas I feel that this game discourages this by introducing penalties for these attempts. I feel that spending time looking through the deck for the right card is penalty enough, it takes forever! Did enjoy the puzzles of the game, but felt like it tried too hard to be a real escape room while missing all the proper elements.

Certainly paled in comparison to the Exit: The Lost Cabin.    We didn't need any hints in the Exit game, but we got stuck in this game and had to ask for hints... which most of the time didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.   Would have preferred the ability to get additional levels of hints when we were stuck.   Not a positive experience for the family.   Probably not going to purchase more in this series.

This was the first Unlock! -scenario for me and although I had some fun with it, in our group we had some issues as well. We solved one puzzle with answer, which gave us a card which we shouldn't get in that point - later on we came back to the same solution again and then we realized what happened (I've read here at BGG that other gaming groups have had the same situation with 'Unlock! The Formula'). This can happen because of the game mechanism used where your "solution" is to put couple of cards together and find the card number which is the same than your solution. Couple of puzzles where neat ones, but there were also "not so great" ones too. So, I don't know; I would like to try another Unlock-scenario although this first one wasn't that great experience. 'Escape the Room: Stargazer's Manor' gave me a better experience.

Hidden numbers are awful and the hints are useless. We got stuck because of this - despite watching out for it and going over every card many times. The game was destroyed to the point where we had to look ahead to reverse engineer a solution due to missing a super tiny number on one card even after taking all available hints (None of which were anything that wasn't blatantly obvious).  This is devastating to a one shot game.

RATING: 8
"Escape room in a deck of cards. Well-done, and the puzzles were tough (for us) but reasonably fair. No destruction, so you can give or sell the game away. Relies on an app, but that seems reasonable here."

What I like:
- Just a deck of cards (plus an app)
- Can give or sell the game away after playing
- Small box; modest price

What I don't like:
- The puzzles were just a bit difficult for us
- Some of the hidden numbers are tough to see in dim light
- One play, and you're done with it

Probably best with 2-4 players. More brains might help, but there isn't much to do in parallel. The rating reflects my desire to play again, if playing again were actually viable.

Unlock! The Formula is a cooperative escape room-style game that's all contained in a single deck of cards (and a mobile app). Like other games in this genre, this game is meant to be played through only once, though no components are destroyed and the game can be played by another group.  In this scenario, you're stuck in a laboratory, and mostly interacting with the equipment within.  While I found some of the numbers easy to overlook in this game, I thought the puzzles were generally interesting and what you would expect from this sort of game.  I'm not sure why, but this one to me feels like the best introduction to the Unlock series, and the others are variations off this scenario.

This was a fun experience, but didn't quite live up to the fun of Squeek and Sausage for us. This was our 2nd escape room style game after that one, and ultimately was a bit of a let down. We still had quite a bit of fun, but overall this one went too fast and seemed too easy for us. I feel the back of the box should have this at one star on their difficulty scale compared to Squeak and Sausage's two. I'm hoping that the next one (Island of Dr. Goorse) with it's three star difficulty will bring us a great experience instead of the merely good one this game gave us.

Very good rendition of an escape room in a box. This is the second one I've played and this time through it was easier (but still challenging!) to solve the puzzle. Difficulty level would be very high for people who have not done escape rooms or played previous versions.

Got this one for 11 bucks. Wanted to see what all the escape room board game hype was all about I suck so bad at real escape rooms and these. When you figure something out, you feel super good, when you are stuck and have to do a hint on 5 things in a row, you feel like a retard. But once you finish it you say, "I wouldn't mind doing another one." It's about the same in both real escape rooms and simulated ones. The hidden numbers were all but impossible to see on the cards, and I didn't always love the number system, but there were some real moments of excitement. Overall, not bad for $10 bucks. Get a couple of friends together, put in 4 bucks a piece, and have an hour of brain burning fun. I here the other systems are better though. Looking forward to trying them.

This has been my favorite of the Unlock! series, but I still enjoy the Exit series better.  The Unlock! series has a few puzzles that I've found to be too obscure.

The Formula was probably the easiest of the 3 I played (Squeek & Sausage, The Formula and The Island of Doctor Goorse).

RATING: 5
Reasonably fun escape room but to be honest it didn't do a single novel thing. It felt like someone took all the character out of a normal escape room and the most common puzzle types. The app is basically pointless for this deck and the limited use it has could have been done some other way.

RATING: 5.7
Of the first three published Unlock adventures, this was the least impressive to me. Visually, it has the least striking art direction (realistic depictions of real-world objects, a limited color palette except when being used to distinguish puzzle elements). It has what I think the designers would term as the "most realistic" puzzle logic, in that the puzzles deviate just a little in form from the tutorial. The premise for each puzzle is uninspired.

That said, the minimal bump up in complexity from those tutorial puzzles still lead to some frustration due to the non-linear sequencing of necessary clues. Lots of time was spent on puzzles for which we didn't have all the information. Lots of time was spent looking for a small object on a card, until we finally looked it up and found it was on a card we had already dismissed...

This game was AWESOME! I love these escape room games and this one is a fantastic example of why they're so good. The puzzles weren't so hard that you got frustrated, but weren't so easy that it wasn't fun. It was kind of the perfect weight. I loved it! It's a shame you can't play it more than once.

A very average entry in the series. There was one clever moment in the game involving a periodic table, but our experience was otherwise marred by a frustrating search for a hidden number, a section in which we were stumped and accidentally revealed cards prematurely, and an anticlimactic final puzzle.

Before playing through Unlock!The Formula, I was introduced to the series and Unlock! system by getting to try Unlock! The Elite first. The experience was pretty good and my initial impressions were favorable and I felt excited to play through the full Unlock! The Formula scenario. So, our group read through the instructions, fired up the app, and started solving puzzles, but it didn't take long before we got stuck, really stuck and the hints weren't helping.  This was very frustrating and my enjoyment and interest with the Unlock! system in general and The Formula scenario in particular dropped rapidly. By the end of the game, it felt like the the entire thing was rushed through development as it felt clunky and unrefined - especially since Deckscape implemented a similar card-only escape room concept that was better since it provides multiple puzzle threads and it's mechanism doesn't drive obvious decisions during the game. Looking for red and blue number cards to combine in Unlock! detracts from the theme. In addition, it shouldn't be possible to combine two cards to get a result that actually exists in the deck but is NOT something related to the objects combined. The result is a huge continuity error that spoils parts of the game yet to come while also adding to the confusion and frustration of actually trying to play the game. Also, the clue system in the Unlock! app is not helpful and seems to be incorrect since some cards actually necessary for solving puzzles are reported as being "nothing of interest" when querying the app for a clue about the card. It's not really clear how a completely misguided "hint" is useful or adds to the experience and enjoyment of the game play. In the end, our group failed miserably due to a missed hidden item even though one group member decided to sacrifice himself and look through the deck and was still unable to backtrack through the scenario to figure out what we had missed. We eventually resorted to consulting an online resource to understand what went wrong. That should not happen in a good game design or production. In looking back for the hidden item, it's definitely there on the card, but the graphic design and choice of number is questionable since all five of us looked at the card at least four times each and nobody ever saw it. There is apparently a hidden item function in the app that we didn't know about or use, so maybe that would have helped since the one hidden item pretty much ruined the experience. I really love puzzle and escape room games, but so far I am extremely disappointed with the Unlock! series after the problems encountered while playing Unlock! The Formula. I have now played sixteen or seventeen escape room scenarios spanning eight different series and Unlock! is my least favorite so far.

Played solo and took me longer than the 60 minutes slated. I love puzzles and think I am pretty good at solving them so this was a good challenge. Being colourblind I had some real difficulty with some of the puzzles. Really enjoyed it, but this would have been more fun with 2 people.

RATING: 3
Yes, I did it. Took SEVEN points away for one reason alone, a single clue on which we lost 35 minutes and looked at every possible hint, entirely ruining the game, and it the cheapest, cheapest hint you will ever find in a an escape board game. Yes, we loved the game apart of this one, but it was enough to waste the entire episode. And I know we are not the only ones who had a bad experience because of this. 

I could say, "Well, when we play again, we will know", but... there is no playing again this scenario, so that's that.

We have one game to escape
It means designers have one game to make it right.

After "The Elite" I had thought that the app was nice to have but could have been replaced by cards/paper with minimal difficulty; the best puzzle in The Formula proves that is not the case. I'm now totally sold on the system. If it had come out before TIME Stories I don't think that game would have done nearly as well.

While I recognize that puzzle difficulty is very hard to get right (getting stuck is even less fun than breezing through), this one is probably too easy. Nevertheless, very enjoyable, and amazingly successful with a non-gamer.

[b]After playing all three of the Escape Adventures series (Squeek & Sausage [2p], The Formula [5p] and The Island of Doctor Goorse [5p])[/b]:

Oh well, I don't think escape room games are for me. While they've proven to be very involved, engaging and thematic, they're not the most satisfying gaming experiences. More than challenging I find them head-banging-on-the-table frustrating, the main culprit being the overly cryptic puzzles. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not a huge fan of IRL escape rooms either, but I'll give Space Cowboys credit for recreating that same experience in tabletop format. Having a group that's familiar with the genre helps out significantly. Wouldn't mind trying out Mystery Adventures in the future. The more players, the merrier and would recommend at least 4p.

Verdict: [b]6[/b]

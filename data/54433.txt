Good game that scales up to 6 or even 8. A fun loving game really - but surprisingly so given it's a Steve Jackson game. It's all about bluffing and pushing your luck. Mainly its a party game - but for that, it works well.

Good Liar's Dice style game. Tweaks the formula a little. With the right group (and the right BOC) this game can be a riot, otherwise it can be very dry.

RATING: 6
A different spin on Liar's dice where you need to make bids and convince the tribes man to come along for the hunt thats you have bid up while the one who called your bluff tries to convince people to stay at home, sometimes it can go well or not based on who goes or sometimes on the luck of the draw so a fine balance of the two. Works well for what it wants to achieve, I prefer Liar's dice though.

Interesting bluffing and push-your-luck mechanics, although someone can jump out to an insurmountable lead by being the only one to doom or succeed on a hunt.  I enjoy it, but it's kind of unforgiving.  It's very similar to Liar's Dice, but with a theme and no player elimination (and cards).

On one hand I loved this game. I love the bidding similar to Liar's Dice. I adore the added tension of the hunt as the cards are flipped randomly one at a time which just builds the excitement. On the other hand, I just don't like this game. First of all it requires at least 5 players, I play more with 4 players so this is hard to get to the table. Secondly, if one player lucks into a hunt (or doom) all by him/herself they can attain an absolutely insurmountable lead. This happened in our one play of this game on the first hunt and so the rest of the rounds were basically irrelevant. Not to mention how confusing the scoring system is, that just feels pointlessly complex. But the biggest problem I have with the game is that there is no scaling. In Liar's Dice as the number of dice diminish the bids get faster and more intense. However in Nanuk the bids in the final hunt could be identical to those in the first hunt. It just lacks something when all the rounds feel exactly the same. Still there was some fun and excitement to Nanuk, and I'd play again if someone asked.

This is sort of like a variant on Liars Dice.  The artwork is OK and I'll give it credit for having a unique attempt at a theme.  The payoff of the bluff isn't really worth it though.  It lacks thrills and excitement.  It handles a large group and I think that is it's biggest strength.

RATING: 7
Fun game for a large group, but can sort of break a bit if everyone gets cynical and wants to earn the easy, sure points by sabotaging everything.   So the mechanics are a little bit broken in that regard.  It would be  a little more balanced if there was a way that a smaller number of people could potentially complete a hunt.  Perhaps that could be done by adding one or two  +3 or +4 cards in the deck, allowing for the threat that perhaps one player can contribute a huge amount.

It's really not terrible, but it's totally unnecessary. The comparisons to Liar's Dice and Coyote/Pow-wow are apt, but Nanuk suffers badly in that comparison. Those games can be played with a lot of skill. This is pretty much a crapshoot luckfest. Way too many unknown variables to make decent guesses. 

I got dealt two of the 'protection' cards in my game, which gave me a massive overpowering advantage. I had two hunts where I knew success was likely. It was too easy. I was bored.

Fun but not (at first blush) especially strategically interesting. Maybe there's some interesting decisions bubbling underneath.

If your crowd is not on board with that, I can see how this could end up being kind of agonizing.

Nanuk is a charming party game where players take the roles of Inuit hunters. There are 4 types of animal cards that players are dealt a hand of each round. In order, players take turns making boasts about how many of a given type they can bring back, and in how many days. These boasts have to keep ascending in animal numbers of length of days (z.B.: I think we can catch 8 arctic walrus in 4 days!) until someone declares that "this hunt is doomed!," thus becoming the head doomsayer. The other players at the table then secretly decide if they are with the hunters or doomsayers. Hunters contribute cards to the hunt (possibly those that are being hunted, possibly just chaff they want to get rid of) and the doomsayers each risk 1 card as well. The hunters then flip cards from the deck equal to the number of days declared in the boast, hopefully hitting the animal target and hopefully not running into a card with a polar bear symbol on the corner, which will prematurely end the hunt. Whichever group is successful (hunters or doomsayers) will get to collect animal cards from the table (based on cards flipped in the hunt and those contributed by the hunters) with the goal of making Knizia-esque sets for the end game. This continues through a few rounds (varies based on number of players) and then is scored. As others have said, this is basically Liar's Dice with a couple of additions.

Nanuk is a fun light party style game. Simple enough to teach to people at a party, and fun in practice. I'm not really a party gamer, but I certainly enjoyed our play of this game. It rates as it does for me because I would not be in the mood for this very frequently, which isn't an indictment of the design so much as a statement of what I enjoy in games. Those who are looking for something that they can play with non-gamer friends, or even with their families at holiday gatherings will likely like what they find here, and this is easily the best game that I've played from the Steve Jackson catalogue.

I played this game in prototype form at a game designer retreat.  I thought it was the best game at the retreat by a good margin.  If the published version is anything like the version I played, then it's a great game.

Nanuk is basically a Liar's Dice variant which improves the game by getting everyone to participate in each turn.  It also has a cool hunting theme which adds to the fun.  We often found ourselves chanting while playing the game.  The only thing I was disappointed about was knowing that it already had found a publisher. 

I rated the prototype.  Will update the rating when I play the published edition.

Very neat negotiation/push your luck game with set collecting for the scoring mechanism that plays best with fairly large groups.  The fun in this game really comes from the stand-off between the Hunt Master and the Doom Sayer as they each deliver their speeches trying to sway the other clan members to their side.  If you can't get into the roles and really go for it this game will probably fall rather flat but if you have a group that can step up and make with the drama this is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Feels like a party game, because it plays 8 players handily, and invokes a rowdy atmosphere.   The scoring is a bit more gamer-y, and essentially the game plays out like a variant of Liar's Dice but each round one player will be trying to meet a bid (the hunter) and another player will be trying to force failure (the Doomsayers), and everybody else secretly has to choose sides.  The catch is that only the winning team gets to divvy up the loot... and there's lots of cards in the loot usually, which makes it fun.   It's a good time with the right crowd.

I felt like this game was a card game version of" Liar's dice "(also known as "Perudu" or "Bluff"). How ever I liked the dice game version better.  I felt that that"Nanuk" had some inherent difficulties with it's design. The main being the turn order mechanism.(you flip a coin token: one side clockwise other counter-clockwise) In the game we played the was a player who never got a proper turn because of it. The other was the point system. We had three ties. Adding to an ungratifying  play experience.

RATING: 7.3
Quite a good semi-cooperative game that involves collecting sets of animals from eskimo hunts from the mutual success of a series of hunts. While not politically correct, this game is actually quite fun with the right group of gamers. There don't appear to be that many polar bears in the deck that can doom a hunt so be aggressive during the bidding phase and you are more likely to come out on top in the end scoring. Best with 4 or more players ... no less. Have played this with more people and actually found it more difficult to win because of differing allegiances in a larger group.

We've played this about six times now. My family loves this game.  

You bid to be the leader of the hunt.  When one person says the hunt is doomed, the other players must decide to join either the hunters or the doomers.

A lot of push your luck games have you going it alone, this one has players succeeding or failing together.  It creates a great team atmosphere of Us vs Them.   Lots of rooting, trash talking and cheers abound.

A quick game to learn, altho I seem to have trouble explaining it, much easier to do a sample round and learn by doing with this one for some reason.

Itâs been a long time since my only play of this, so I donât remember it very well. I remember I absolutely hate the theme and for now  I have almost no desire to play it. I remember the rules were very easy, it is a bidding game and it is way easier to fail at a hunt, so I won the game always being with the group that say the hunt will fail. It has lots of uncontrollable luck.

I donât remember much more, if I play again, I will come back and re comment.

[size=12][b]This Hunt is Doomed![/b][/size]

Nanuk is a card-based spin on [thing=45][/thing] with - get this - a theme! And not just a theme, but an amusing theme that [i]works[/i]. Whoa. 

Each round of play represents a evening by the campfire followed by a hunt the next morning. In the first phase, the hunters boast of their skill and prowess. How many seals/deer/etc. can they catch, and how quickly? As play proceeds around the table, each player has to boast or call. If you boast, you increase either the size of the catch or the length of the hunt. If you call, you say "This Hunt is Doooomed," preferably in a deep and ominous voice. At that time, everyone at the table must decide in secret to either join the hunter or join the naysayer. This choice is made based on a couple of things. First each player has a hand of cards that they can contribute to the hunt if they join. Players also consider how dangerous the hunt is. Once the teams are revealed, the hunt begins and cards are revealed from the deck, one for each day of the hunt. The catch is that about 1/8 of the cards show the hunters being attacked by polar bears. So a long hunt will yield more bounty but may also fail because of those pesky polar bears. If it succeeds, the hunters win and divy cards for scoring. If it fails, the naysayers win and they receive the cards instead. 

Fun, light game. For the sake of full disclosure, I do game occasionally with one of the designers.

I find the game to be chaotic, with the in/out mechanism being the main driver of success, yet occurring after the bids. Having the whole game hinge on how often you make a winning simultaneous selection makes all the time spent on bidding and card counting and set collection seem like nonsense.

When you read the rules, it seems like Liar's Dice tweaked just a little bit using cards.  But when you start to play I think the game is extremely revelatory as to what type of group you are playing with.

Usually we are so focused on messing with the other players that the way we play this game should be no surprise.  Once the call is made you cannot trust what anyone says, as at least half of the people are lying.  "Oh yeah, I can totally help out on this one."

Some of the other players considered this to be a defect of the game, but I think that you probably just have to take group dynamics into account - the boasts need to be low in a situation like this.  And then never...trust...anyone!

Interesting variant in some ways to Liar's Dice but with an element where each person decides whether they believe and support the person making the statement OR dooms the hunt.  Whichever side is right gets the rewards of the cards that were contributed to the hunt.  Make sets, pairs, and/or polar bears to score points from the cards you collect.

Easily one of the best published by Steve Jackson and plays larger groups of 6-8 very well.

An auction game where you are trying to bid on a number of animals you can hunt and how many days you will hunt them. You must increase until a player becomes a doomsayers.  There are two teams, hunters and doomsayers.  Hunters try to capture a number of animals equal to the bid but not have a bear come up in the number of days.  

It is a simple auction.  The bidding is pretty fun and you can bluff and setup other players.  The hunt is interesting because you hope to make your numbers.  But once a team wins it seems to take forever for people to pick there cards and is slows the game down.  

Somewhat boring like most Steve Jackson games.

great review: 
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/857685/father-geeks-review-of-nanuk

Tom's review makes a very compelling argument for getting this game (for play with larger groups): 
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/506340/video-review-nanuk

Seems good for convention as it will accommodate 5-8 players. And DEFINITELY seems more fun (and more thematic) than Liar's dice; along with a nice push your luck element.

Simple "push your luck" game, with some bluffing due to the simultaneous decision of which of the two factions you want to belong each turn.
Litte control for a light, fast filler, likely better with more players.

Played this at my local game store being demoed by some Steve Jackson reps. Imagine my surprise when I get to the BGG entry to see it was designed by protospielers I met back in 2005!  What a coincidence!  

I thought the game was ok, if a little bit corny.  Kind of like a more advanced liar's dice.  I think it would go over well with non-gamers.

Players wager on the likely success of a hunt, raising the contents of the pot until it seems unlikely to one of the player, who "dooms" it. The last player to up the ante is committed to the hunt; all the others get to choose hunt/doom in a secret ballot.

Loving the cover art on this one!  Minimum players is five so it may not see a lot of table time.  In our first game, one lucky doomer beat six hunters and won the whole hunt and the game.  Unfortunately since it was our first game some of the energy was sucked out as we had to stare at the rules looking for details, like whether cards in the score pile are face down or face up.  Also, we had trouble with the wind coins.  One always flipped to black, and the other always flipped to white.  We didn't have a problem the second time I played this at a Memorial Day party because we were violently flipping the coin everywhere.

RATING: N/A
This game is similar to liars dice when you bid sequentially until someone calls.  Then the remaining players choose sides secretly and attempt to fulfill the bid. If they do, the hunters take the pot, if not, the dissenters gain the cards. At the end of the game, you pair similar animals or one from each to score points. Most points wins.

Minimum number of players is 5.

Very fast and straight forward.

A pretty good push your luck party style game. I always find myself gravitating toward Incan Gold though when I have new players or large groups of players and I'm looking for a simple push your luck game. The scoring is very straight forward but for some reason many people I've played with have complained it's tough.

Steve Jackson takes a break from games with humorous undertones in this Liar's Dice/Diamant hybrid. I think I like this more than I should just because people keep saying "DOOMED" so much. :P

A super fun game for up to 8 players! You are a group of Eskimos heading out on a hunt! Boasting what will be caught is the game! Each player has to up the bet if they choose to boast. Then each person decides if they will join the hunt or doom the hunt! 

I have seen some amazing and surprising plays in this game! The most memorable was when one player boasted 6 fish in 12 days! Only one person joined him on the hunt and they won a ton of cards!

Liar's Dice-ish, but better. Bluffing and Set Collecting Card Game with a Cold Climate Hunting Theme. Players may or may not participate in hunting parties to successfully pull off their hunting boast in order to build up set/combo collections for later scoring.  Neat game. Some fiddly rules. This grew on me a little, but if the game went any longer, I'd much rather play VivaJava.

Plays up to 8 players.

RATING: 5
At its heart, this game is just a Liar's Dice variant, except your bidding or calling bluffs on player contributions plus a random factor.  Then players arrange themselves on teams and put in their contribution, and the winning team splits the available points.  Because players can influence the results, which team wins is very group dependent--if the group is filled with optimists then the bidding team will always win, if pessimists then the bluff-calling team will always win.

I feel this game is broken, where it tries to be both Liar's Dice and Diamant, and fails both.

First, it's way too easy to fail a hunt if wanted.  Many people piled on to the naysayers and the hunters lost a lot.  For the hunters to win, they had to bid low, where then the game seemed to be in a rut of having the same bid all the time.

The goal and scoring also makes no logical sense by getting pairs and four of a kind and polar bears.  It would be more thematically and mechanically better to have people compete for the most animals in a type and give out points for diversifying.

It's really a filler, so not the biggest deal, however there are better ones out there.

Light game about boasting and bluffing a bit. It plays quickly, and the rules are simple. The scoring is a little weird, since it forces you to go for diversity which is something you can't really control. Still, fun enough and a light game not to be taken too seriously.

RATING: N/A
Rules and reviews read: Hmmmm, a design that combines elements of Liar's Dice and Incan Gold, but will the sum of these parts make it greater than either of those two games. One concern is will the divyying up (where you assess pairs and sets) slow the game flow?

One thing that favours Nanuk is that there is no elimination or sitting out your turn too long. But is the card counting and set scoring too much for the family/friend setting?

This game reminds me of 'Clubbin' Baby Seals' which itself is essentially a ripoff of Skulls and Roses. People ante up the bet for how many things they can get in the hunt in how many days, and then when the ante is called people take sides and you find out who wins cards. Making sets or pair gives points, and there are a few small nuances to the game. The game was passingly compared to 'The Resistance', which I think is fair if not apt; I don't think I really care to play either game again.

RATING: 7
An entertaining party game about upping the ante and calling other people's bluff. It's important to note that while party games in general need the right crowd to enjoy them, Nanuk [i]really[/i] needs the right crowd or the game can be killed outright. Let's be fair â this game is simply aces with a group who is willing to consider both conservative and risky bids. But I've also witnessed games with overly pessimistic players who repeatedly vote doom and create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I'd also advise to ditch the cumbersome set-collection aspect of the scoring system and adopt the official [thread=725311]simple scoring variant[/thread] instead, which has worked much better for me when explaining the game to non-gamers. 

Though easily swapped out for any other theme, the Eskimo theme and its artwork are novel. Winning Nanuk is a little arbitrary, but it has those odds-defying moments which make the game worthwhile. I find myself high-fiving allies regularly during games, which says a lot about how much I enjoy this.

It's a Liar's Dice push-your-luck/play-the-odds/bluff-the-others type of game. Here, though there's a theme (players are eskimo hunters) and you play with shifting teams. Each round, players are dealt a hand of 3 cards, which show one of several types of animals, either 1 or 2 pictures per card (also, a special card). You either raise the bid (number and type of animals to be hunted within a number of days; must raise number of either animals and/or days) or call "DOOM!". Then, everyone uses a chip to indicate whether they are supporting the hunter (bidder) or the DOOM-sayer. Clockwise (or counter-, depending on flip of coin), players supporting hunt thrown in 0-3 cards face down; bidder (hunt leader) goes last. These are shuffled then revealed; then draw 1 card/day hunting from the deck. The hunt fails if either a bear is revealed from the deck (without a player having played a special protection card) or the bet number of animals is not revealed amongst all the cards. Whichever team wins gets to take spoils: revealed cards divided evenly amongst players (leader chooses first), with remainder going to bottom of deck (face up; game ends immediately if face up card is revealed). Taken cards are kept face up in front of each player, and will score VP at end of game: per set (1 of each animal), per group of single type (larger number scores more), and for number of symbols on cards. Most VP wins.

Can you believe this is from [company=19]Steve Jackson Games[/company]?! It's actually pretty good! But, oh yeah, this isn't [i]by[/i] Steve Jackson ... now it makes sense! Still, I'm pretty sure I prefer [thing=45][/thing]. Why? Because I'm no good at reading people, I can't bluff, and I generally have no idea what other people are thinking or going to do! Liar's Dice is just much cleaner to me; yes, you still need to deal with other people's bluffing -- but mostly with just one person at a time (the person who precedes you in turn order)! This game is more like [thing=925][/thing]: you need to figure out what everyone is doing, whether or not they're bluffing, if they will actually contribute enough to help with the hunt, whether they will support or doom the hunt, etc.

So: pretty good, but I'd rather play Liar's Dice!

Interesting game that spotlights group dynamics.  I'd like to try it again as we may have been bidding too high or we may have been unlucky sometimes.  It did seem difficult for the hunters to succeed, but that might be a function of the group and we have been overbidding, I'm not sure.  It's funny to hear people persuasively talk up how the hunt will surely succeed, only to then side with the doomers!

A fun bidding game, great for slightly bigger groups. Played with 5 but it should get even more interesting with more players (holds up to 8). There is a decent amount of luck but I liked it for the decision on whether to join in on the hunt or call it doomed (or BS, if you prefer), and then see if you got lucky. The boasting part is fun, too, the whole game just comes with a nice vibe. It seems to offer itself a bit as a drinking game, one shot for every successful hunt; overall really not that bad.

Nanuk is being billed as a "party" game and if it really is that, it is the best damn party game evar! Very amusing, the theme and art are great. The game play is straight forward - you decided if you think the person who last boasted of how many animals they can catch (cards they will receive) in how many days (number of cards revealed) - if it is likely that they will succeed or fail.  If you can contribute to the success you will share in the reward if you feel the hunt is doomed and are correct you will share in the reward - if you are in the wrong camp you get nothing, and if you are a doomsayer lose a card!  Very nifty little game - highly recommended!

Winter is coming. All the hunters boasted of their prowess, but you boasted the loudest. Now you have to deliver . . .
\13\\13\
In Nanuk, each player bids for how long he can stay on the trail and how much he will bring home. Each boast must be greater than the one before, until one hunter refuses to raise the bid, saying "You're doomed!" Then the hunt begins. Will the hunt leader make good on his boast, or will the doomers be right? Every player decides secretly to help . . . or to let it fail.
\13\\13\
Beware Nanuk, the great polar bear, who can end any hunt in failure. If you find an inuksuk, it will protect you - once. If the hunt is successful, the hunters share the animals collected. But if the hunt fails, the doomers score instead.

Left me a bit cold (pun intended) but despite the bidding (which gives you some information about other players' hands) this game is a lot more luck-based: how many players will join your hunt. If everybody thinks it is doomed, you won't get their cards, and you have very little chance to make it.

Pretty complex game in a small-ish box.  Engine building through dice is almost always fun.  This is like [b]To Court the King[/b], but with currency.  Pretty long game too.  I found myself constantly squinting at the icons on the tokens and cards.

The theme is what originally attracted me, and to be honest I would have purchased it on that alone. I bought the game at Essen before getting a demo in actually. When I did get a demo in at Essen it wasn't a full one and as such I really couldn't get a full impression of it at the fair. Well, its been several plays later and O feel I'm now able to say that this game is fantastic. Each round goes fast, there is enough decision making to give the game choice and variety, and the game never takes too long as to feel repetitive. I played this with my fellow craft beer friends and its a great experience.

Good little dice placement game.  Works well solo.  Have only played a couple of 2 player games and it works as a relatively quick filler.  I can see a 4 player game being a lot trickier with action spaces being blocked off.

This little game is a bit more interesting than it at first seems. We did manage to get a KS edition in trade so it has some nice extras like play mats for each player. It's essentially dice placement where over time you can upgrade the dice for higher values. The dice represent beers you are making for sale to the public that will get you points, cash and benefits. You also collect resources to enhance your beers and make them worth more of the aforementioned. The game is nothing innovative or groundbreaking but it is fun and good to look at with steam punk art. Why steam punk in a light Euro about beer making I have no idea. That said, it does have some problems. The resources you get to enhance your brews are tiny circular chits that sit on cards to store them. The cards are not nearly big enough. So every time you pick up one of those resources you are going to knock over the rest. Why they didn't just make a market board or something like that I don't get since they had player mats. Plus the iconography is not intuitive. We are constantly having to look back at the rule book to know what they mean. Good game but it sure could use some polish.

To begin with, this game has exquisite graphic design. The theme is very nice also and I was excited to play a brewing game with dice. However - many of the abilities offer pointless, frustrating "take that" interaction. Being able to just do destructive things to your opponent is not the good kind of interaction I am looking for in a euro game with a brewing theme. In the first round after just having heard the instructions the game seemed promising, but during the play I was a bit let down, didn't seem robust enough.

Decent, if slow, dice game. I like that you can save dice for later, and enjoy the mechanic of spending two dice to get a new die instantly, or waiting a turn for the new die. Both of these things put an interesting pressure, as there really is a race to complete the recipes first.

Unfortunately, there is a "rich get richer" aspect of the game, as one terrible roll early on can really hinder a player, which will only worsen as the game progresses. I wish there were more opportunities to reroll (or were at least more things to do with low rolls).

Enjoyable dice game where you use your dice to "brew" beer and for special actions to set up your next brewable beer. There is not much interaction between players, although enough to be able to foil some possible plans they might have. My first experience was that certain colored dice were quite powerful/useful, so if you're a bit unlucky with those rolls, you might be in for a slight disadvantage.

As a very moderate beer lover, Dice Brewing is an eye-catcher as far as its subject matter goes. Unfortunately the idea of brewing is not carried over well into the game: what the dice rolling is supposed to signify is a little bit beyond me, to be honest. Brewing is a matter of carefully honing options in an arguably simple process; interjections from lots of d6's don't fit in this pattern.

The idea is that Dice Brewing is a dice engine builder. You obtain more and more dice to be able to make recipes requiring specific dice and dice value combinations all that more quickly; you augment them with special ingredients which you pay for by completing previous recipes; and in order to stop the competition there are nasty pinpricks which block off access to dice and various actions. And that's more or less the entire game. It all reminds me considerably of Andreas Seyfarth's Airships, but then with fixed dice rolling schemes and more interactivity through said pinpricks.

I don't think the innovation in the rarely used dice engine building sufficiently innovative to make me give up Airships, though. The fixed conversion schemes get old rather quickly (more would have been possible very easily); the only thing which is interesting is the ability to roll all dice which are left in the supply and thus get a better number that way. It is also rather saddening to see that in a game such as this the ability to deal with bad rolls—which are completely out of a player's control to begin with—are relegated to a variant rule giving you a little paltry cash to be able to purchase an enhancing ingredient for a later turn. Whether or not that ingredient will ever have to be used in the future is an open question. I'm not saying that Airships is a model for dealing with such bad fortune, but at least there the compensation is directly linked to your main action: dice rolling. Finally there are the pinpricks I mentioned above: this is more or less the only way to deal with players which are moving too quickly, as competition for resources only makes itself felt at the very high ends of the player scale. This interaction is very direct—'don't use these actions', 'don't use these dice', 'that die is mine now'—and it feels somewhat out of place in this game. Again I am tempted to say that better and more intelligent approaches could have been implemented. So Dice Brewing gets a 'hmhm' at best for its game aspects.

Unfortunately artwork and rulebook do not do the game much justice either. From a distance the icons and numbers are indecipherable, and that finally causes 1 point deduction from its rate. As for the rule book: it isn't laid out particularly well; the first 3/4rs are explanation of game material including all sorts of rules which at the very end get repeated again very quickly. It would make more sense to do a quick rundown of the rules first, and move the material explanations to the back, because then a reader has the ability to anchor the information. It all makes matters more complex than they have to be.

[b]Update[/b] Nope, still exactly the same issues. Underdeveloped, lousy rules, unexciting game play. Truly, avoid.

I'll start with a quote. As one of my friends said: "This game has probably one of the coolest themes!" I couldn't agree more. "Dice Brewing" is the game they always want to play no matter how tired they are. We all love the artwork - it's awesome and adds a nice flavour to the game (those beer mugs filled with golden liquid). The game is nice, smooth, fun and - what's really, really important these days - easy to learn. You HAVE TO check this one out, guys!!!

Absolutely fantastic game. I'm very impressed that this kind of game was released by such a small company. Fantastic job, guys! Graphics and theme are one of the best I've ever seen! I even adore the manual attached to the game:) Of course - it's a dice game so it depends on luck.. but that's what the dice games are about. And there are some mitigation mechanisms, which make the game winnable even with lower than average results. I love this game and can't wait till I come back to Europe and play more and more :) But I wouldn't recommend this for players who prefer absolutely-no-random kind of games. This could be frustrating. :)

Baseline rating after one game I enjoy.  Took a few rounds to get rolling (heh) but once we did it went quick and was fun.  But I feel the folks I played with looked at money as a way to win the game so we ran out of money REAL fast and had to resort to dice of other colors not in the game, then those ran out... so I need another play where everyone knows the game to make final judgement if my rating'll go up or down (probably up a bit I like the idea and the way the game works a lot).

RATING: 5
Played Oct 2014

Another dice game gone wrong. No compelling decisions, nothing clever to do, and the most annoying double sided money chits ever created.

--------------------------------------------------

Read the rules Sept 23 2014

A light game for sure, but more involved then many dice games. Similar to King's Forge in terms of complexity. I like a lot of the mechanics surrounding the use of dice, upgrading and invoking abilities on the player board. The theme fits pretty well too.

I'm not keen on the negative player interaction, but this might be tolerable if the game is short. It just seems completely unnecessary. It might be possible to do away with the negative action tokens entirely. Or house rule the negative away from several of them. It is a small portion of the game and I've been assured from the designers that the game works well even if you remove these tokens.

I'm looking forward to playing this game!

Nice dice manipulation game. the flow is good, game is fun, depending on the players at the table it could be 'friendly' or with a bit/a lot of 'take that' if the black market actions are taken up a lot or not.

I rather liked this one.  A lot more tough decisions to make than I expected from the rules, and a chance to interfere kind-of directly with opponents forces you to have a look at turn order and the playmats of the others.  Nice illustrations as well.

RATING: 6.6
Decent enough little game, but some of the contracts/beers are much better than others. Furthermore, the artwork is very busy. Finally, the game does take a long time for what it is, but it is a game I wouldn't mind playing again.

The extra actions are pretty crappy - only if you really want to go for direct interaction, in your face. If you don't like that, and we don't really, then the action apart from the two actions (+1 and rerolling) are useless, and since you have to discard these tiles after use, it makes no sense to get this bonus, even though sometimes you don't have a choice and need to complete a contract regardless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's a cool dice game but one that overstays it's welcome... if it was a shorter game it would be great, this way it's good but one that if I have other things to play it will probably not be selected just because of the length of the game

RATING: 5
The game is a bit boring and repetitive. A lot of luck in the dice and in the receipes that will be at disposal in the turn. If you don't roll a 5 or a 6 with the blue die, you will make all the game with only one blue die. It has a few take that tiles, that does not make much sence and are not fun at all. Remeber me the 'you don't play in the next turn' action in old classic games. My low ratting is a more a personal thing, since I still don't appreciate dice games with a lot luck envolved.

One of the biggest dissapointment in 2015. I love dice management games so I was eagerly awaiting the possibility to play that one. Unfortunately the game did not get me at all, it is rather boring rolling experience, and dice management is incorporated in that way that you still have to roll higher result to make progress. Sorry, that time has passed already, now dice game have to be more sophisticated and bring some meaningful decisions on the table.

Dice placement and manipulation game. It's more of a game than you might think at the first glance. Although still more pips on die means better - there are plenty to do even with lower throws - u can also manipulate results and block the dice and brewery of an opponent so experienced players will have the filed to strategize. The basic mechanism and subject :) are straight forward but it's definitely not a beer pong or other pretzel game to play after many beers. Worth trying if you like beer & dice a lot :D.

(+) Beautiful artwork!

(+) Nice big dice

(+) You feel like you build up to something: when you start collecting more dice, possibilities expand considerably

(+) The game offers some (basic?) decisions to players, which is a plus given it's a dice game - so it remains very accessible.



(-) I really don't like the negative player interaction tokens. They are harsh and they risk adding too much chaos to this game

(-) Too luck dependant: not only in dice rolls (which can be manipulated to a certain level), but more importantly in the recipe card draws.

(-) Too much downtime for a dice game

(-) Player boards are printed too small: strange given the dice are so big. Coin tokens with different numbers on both sides are *not* the way to go!

Approx gametime:
- Without much negative player interaction: approx 20 min / player
- With extensive use of negative player interaction: approx 30 min / player

Theme is pretty pasted on, and blue dice are so powerful that getting a couple of high blue rolls in the early rounds generates a snowball effect to where they can run away with the game. Getting new dice is pretty challenging initially and the ramp is slow and boring. Overall, some interesting ideas here that don't really come together well at all.

RATING: 5
This is a Yahtzee-style dice chucking/worker placement game with the theme of brewing different kinds of beer.  The different colored dice represent hops, light and dark malt, and skill which is used to do better things with your dice or accelerate certain actions.  Each round you roll your dice and place them on your own personal mat of actions to convert them into different dice, increase their value, re-roll, or a couple other standard dice rolling game actions.  After each player is finished with their actions they have the opportunity to buy items from the normal market which includes spices, fruit, etc. to make fancier beers.  Or from the black market that has items that allow you to get things like extra re-rolls or even attack actions against other players.  Finally each player brews beers with the dice they have available and it moves onto the next turn.

I think games like this at this point in time really need to be spectacular to impress because the market is saturated with them.  This is probably the 5th+ Yahtzee-style game I've owned over the past year or two and probably the 10th+ one I've played.  I simply don't think this one impresses compared to even most of those.

It is fine and if you like beer I'm sure this will resonate more than some of those others thematically but mechanically I think this game has a few issues.  The first and most general of these being that the rules are a bit convoluted for a set of mechanics that are really incredibly simple.  There are specific rules for what you can take in the way of actions, how many of certain things you can buy and use, when certain action spaces unlock, when you can put different dice in different areas, etc.  In the end you have a reasonably light and simple game that is over-convoluted with these minor rules and timings that doesn't really make it strategically deeper.

More specifically I think the game needs two major changes.  The first is there needs to be some kind of balancing mechanism with opening player order.  One of those unnecessarily convoluted rules I mentioned is that when a number of players equal to the total player count minus one uses the same action during a round that action is blocked for the remaining player.  The last player being seriously affected like this sucks in general for games where you can't control player order but it really sucks on the first turn in this game.  2 of the 3 or 4 (depending on player count) starting brews require 2 yellow dice and each player only starts with one.  Each player has the ability to create one on the first turn to have a chance at those brews...except the last player if all the other players take this action which really seems like the most common and logical first turn action.  So more than likely the last player in turn order will not have the ability to brew a beer on the first turn putting him immediately behind.

This is exacerbated by the fact that a. the game is a variable number of turns where it ends after a certain number of beers have been brewed so the player at the end of opening turn order will most likely get fewer turns toward the front of turn order than the other players and have a natural disadvantage. And b. there is no turn order balancing during setup.  The last player should get an extra die or more starting money or something, but the setup just have them start with the same resources as the first player.  I was the last player in our first game of this and I certainly felt it almost immediately when I got locked out of the light hops action space and immediately fell behind the other 3 players.

The other major change I think the game needs is  a limit to the number of dice a player can accumulate.  As designed the number of total dice in a game is limited but not the number a single player can acquire.  So a player can spend the opening turns focusing solely on acquiring as many dice as possible and snowball to victory while starving the other players out of dice.  This is especially true in a four player game where the same number of dice is available for the most number of players.

On a slightly more minor note in terms of actual affect on the game I think the components leave a lot to be desired.  The player boards are incredibly small and look very busy and crowded with the amount of information they show and the number of some of the components in the game is just silly.  Some components are not limited such as seeds and money and there is not enough to accommodate a 4-player game past setup.  Even the artwork and component quality seemed pretty cheap.

All-in-all this is a game with very little going for it past a fun theme for beer drinkers.  A pretty big pass for me.

If you get behind early, you stay behind the whole game. It can ruin a whole hour for someone, especially when learning.

Fun and light game with tough decisions. Surprising amount of thinking involved for a game this light, but in this case its not a bad thing, makes it interesting and seems like a heavier game.

Luck involved in dice rolling, but there are ways to mitigate luck and manipulate your results. All special action tokens you can buy add an interesting spice. You can either help yourself or harm your opponent with the same action, but you must choose which one you want to do. For example protect one of your own dice or remove a die from your opponent's storage, so she can't use it for brewing that round.

This game looks delicious. Reasonable sized box and not expensive, thumbs up!

Very fun, dice-based game with a beer brewing theme. Had a very close 4-player game, so it looks to be fairly balanced. Should have good replayability with all the variation in set up.

Disappointed with this one. A bunch of things (too-small player boards, flimsy cards, annoying attack mechanism, rotten instructions, fiddly limitations, runaway for player who rolls high blue in round 3, cost of dice on beer too low, etc) all add up to an amateurish design.

The rules are not very handsome - still have some trouble to understand for e.g. if blue dice go back to the pool after usage and be rerolled?

UPDATE: Nice support of the game designer helped me understand some of the gaming topics. Nevertheless the components in the rules should have been explained in combination with the actions for a better understanding of the handling.

Ugh, what wasted potential! There's maybe something to be salvaged from the dice-pool management center, but everything else is super awkward and dull. Action selection is boring and weirdly limited, dice use is strange and specific (if at least thematic), and the whole thing reeks of not being developed enough.

Quite quick, push-your-luck game. It is fun if you do not play it too often and complain about randomness of the dices mechanics. ; ) The brewing theme is not abstract and is well connected with the rest of the game.

Quite fun dice building game. But there are better games in this genre(eg King's Forge), so this falls kinda flat for me.

I have a soft spot for dicegames, allthough I often loose games because of die results. But this one feels very good. A very interesting way to use your dice, original theme and beautiful artwork. I'm pretty sure my rating can go up if I have played this more often. But the first play already made me want more! Cheers!

Excellent dice game. Current rating based on a 2-player game, I think the rating will go up when I get a chance to play it with more players.

Nice little game that seems quite balanced even though there is a lot of randomness. Too much backstabbing for my taste, though, and the lack of structure in using action tokens leads to a Mexican standoff every turn.

Great theme, and the game has beautiful cards, but gameplay was highly random and not entertaining enough for a 90 minute play experience.

Dice game that combines randomness and decisions. Plus interesting theme and tremendous artwork makes a game that is refreshing. And you can be very mean in this game.

Altogether it is not a bad game, but I didn't like too much the number of available special actions in a two-player game: you can mess up the other player plan every turn by using a single action token. Maybe adjusting the number of action tokens to the number of players would reduce the interaction enough to make the game less frustrating.

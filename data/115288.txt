Rated the same as the base game and best used in conjunction with it. The gold cards are great and the new hero cards really work well with them to introduce new strategies.

The two-currently mechanics are very similar to Thunderstone or Ascension, but with worse theme and production values (and, I suspect, game balance). Not really a reason to own this if you have the other two, unless you specifically need the Penny Arcade theme

Dramatically increases the worth of the game, it's a large stand-alone expansion with just about as much content, and also some new twists like multi-colored Gold cards. The real draw for me though is just that you get more Heroes, Bosses, and everything else to mash together and lend it more replay value.

I play a more personalized way than the rule book with some gimmicks thrown in that I think make the game more balanced and better, but it was still one of my first game and holds a special place in my heart.

Adds to the fun of Gamers vs. Evil with new cards and increases replay value. The new Hero cards are as good if not better than those from the first, the new Gamer and Evil cards are just as good and funny, and the Gold cards allow new strategy in play.

This is an excellent deck builder with multiple currencies and great humor.  The boss's really add flavor to the genre.

Great expansion cards- the cards from this deck easily fit into the original "Gamers vs Evil" deck. Look at pics to see how I modded my game box to fit both and organized it very nicely.

More of the same, and that's fine. The new gold cards seem really powerful, but I never thought the game was especially well balanced to begin with.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

I like Penny Arcade: The Game – Gamers vs. Evil, I find it to be a fun and, mostly, strategic deck builder game so I was keen to try the new (for me) iteration in the game system and I liked it.

Penny Arcade: The Game – Rumble in R'lyeh plays exactly the same as the previous game and the most important thing it adds, are the new cards. This edition of the game can be played by itself or mixed with the previous set. I have played, many times, Penny Arcade: The Game – Gamers vs. Evil, so I’m very happy to get new cards to play with. It also adds gold cards, cards that cost tokens and power to acquire and they are quite powerful.

I don’t know anything about the Penny Arcade universe, but it seems fans of the source materiel enjoy the game more than me. The theme is ok, some of the cards are funny. On the other hand I didn’t feel any Cthulhu theme in the set (but I haven’t played with all the cards).

Penny Arcade: The Game – Rumble in R'lyeh has an static card offering (like Dominion), and that’s huge deal for me for two big reasons. 1. It makes the game strategic (you can plan the whole game from the beginning, thus it has a low luck factor). 2. it is fair for all players (all cards are available to all players since the beginning, nothing of that nonsense of having different cards to purchase every turn making the luck of the game uncontrollable ). Just for that reason I like this game much more than other games that have a variable market offering (Ascension, Legendary, Star Realms, Clank! among others), in those games tactics is what it is most important and the luck factor is much higher.

The game has bosses to be defeated and luck decides which card you get when you defeat a boss. I don’t mind this much, as all the cards are powerful in some way.

The new cards are fun to play, when I play more with the set I will come back to write my thoughts about them, but for now, I´m very happy to have new things to try, new cards to explore. The game system really needed an expansion and when you mix the cards, the replayability factor increases a lot.

I wasn´t able to find the rules online, that's sad and weird.

Bottom line, I like Penny Arcade: The Game – Rumble in R'lyeh. It is a good deckbuilding game and I will keep it among my game collection for now (Dominion is still the best for me). For me, it is essential that a deckbuilder game has a static market offering, otherwise, luck and tactics become much more important than strategy. I had fun playing the game and I want to play it again soon. I want to mix both sets together.

Pretty fun, I like the theme a lot, it's entertaining. I need to play it a few more times to see if it's deeper, it seems pretty straight forward on the surface, but I think with the right market combos it could be pretty hardcore.

As a standalone game, it doesn't have as much variety as the original, if only because there's only three bosses (one red, one green, one gold) and you can't use them in any other configurations like you can with the two of each in the original.

Regardless, adds a lot to the game - the gold cards are, for the most part, are super powerful!  Especially the gold boss.  But they're expensive to get, needing Tokens and Power each.  Plus, one of the Cthulu cards is particularly interesting, allowing you to grab another Boss Loot for free if you set it up right (and giving Magical Unicorn an even better use, clearing through your deck to set it up).

NOT playing with the gold cards is just as good, except some red/green cards rely on gold cards being present, so they become duds if you play with them in that case.

I would have liked to see more gold cards, frankly, in the end.  There's already plenty of red/green in the base - why add more of the same idea, and only a handful of new?  (although the new red/green cards are different and interesting themselves, I'm not saying they're pointless)  I'd just like to see more than 2 different of each 3/3, 4/4 and 5/5 gold cost levels.  That's only 6 different golds (other than the one boss, and he's so expensive you can go many games without seeing all his Loot).  And the game suggests you set up the gold row with one at each cost level, so buying them is less restrictive - so we only get two different gold parts of the board?  We can mix up the costs (a couple 4/4 cards, one 5/5, whatever), but in the end, there just isn't enough gold variety there, and that's a minor disappointment.

Definitely glad I got this, both games fit in a single box and easy to set up, I would have just liked to see more gold.

Traded at BGF 2013 with $30 for Zombie State: Diplomacy of Decay.

A fantastic game made even better.  The addition of the gold cards is a great idea.  It makes spending your tubes and tokens a little more difficult.  Do you pass up on taking a green and a red card for one gold card?  The gold boss loots are very tough to acquire as well but they can really pack a punch if you can get your hands on one!

A real step-up from the first game Penn-Arcade: Gamers vs. Evil. Introduction to the Gold Card set makes getting both green and red cards more valuable to players. I own both games and able to combine both to make more options to future games.

A nice improvement on the Penny Arcade game that adds in "gold cards" which can be purchased with a combination of resources. This adds a lot more flexibility to possible strategies you can use.

I am really enjoying this one. It has a certain funky fun factor other Deck Building games don't have.

There are places where it could be improved by at it's core it is basic deck building with a few added niceties.

I'm surprised I liked this one as much as I did. This is simply a Dominion-style deck builder with 2 different forms of currency instead of 1. The game is incredibly straightforward, and aside from some asymmetric player abilities, the game doesn't much of anything new to the table. I admit I don't really care for the Penny Arcade theme, although I do like Lovecraftian stuff, which is why I went with this set. Unfortunately, there isn't much here besides Cthulhu, though this is definitely the more family-friendly set of the two Penny Arcade games. Even though this is basically a slightly more railroaded Dominion clone, I found myself really enjoying it. Picking up the other base set seems to be a necessity, however, as there aren't a ton of different decks included in this box.

I liked the two competing currencies in a deck building game.  The cards were of course funny, although that doesn't necessarily translate to extended enjoyment.  For example "Bromance" involved high fiving someone else to share some card drawing, which was fun.  It seemed like a good deck builder.

I have a deck building addiction, but there are just too many better ones. This is overly complex for a relatively simple game.  Their later games (DC and Lord of the Rings) are SO MUCH better.  The company obviously needed to work on their game mechanics and this seems to be the "trial" version and just isn't that enjoyable. It isn't bad, just their other games are so much better, I'd rather play them any day of the week. (JW)

Love Penny Arcade. Variable deckbuilding game, but everything you can buy is laid not, not random from a deck like Ascension. Still different strategies to go for. Humor is odd and vague but right up your alley if you read the comic.

If I ever bought a card game that had multiple sets of eight different cards with the same illustration I would return it from whence it came and never again return to the location of from whence it had previously came from.

Love the first game, and this is an improvement. The gold cards are a lot of fun, and even the sillier, gimmicky cards (Head Crabs, etc.) are welcome. 

The setup is still lengthy, increased by the added cards. I hope the iOS version comes out soon, to fix that issue...

I liked the original PA deck builder, so I decided to get this expansion.  I felt the expansion wasn't as good as the original.  The gold cards that require both types of currency is an interesting mechanic, but I just feel that the execution of it could have been better.  

The rules require you to choose ahead of time whether or not to include the gold cards.  The setup is a little different when you choose to include the gold cards.  You add a third boss and must include 3 gold cards in the pool that you can buy.  The cards require 3/3, 4/4 and 5/5 each of tokens and power to buy.  This set up seems to really skew the game in favour or those characters that help power the gold strategy.

I just decided to use my own house rules.  I include both gold cards with the red and green cards when randomising the cards that you can buy.  It makes for the possibility of any number of gold cards.  It may make the gold boss harder to buy.  I don't think that is an issue because the gold boss cards are just insanely powerful compared to the red or green boss cards.

I give it a slightly lower rating than the original.  The reason is that I feel they could have done a better job with gold cards.  They could have made it work more seamlessly with the red and green cards.  I think my house rules fix the issue somewhat.  I will still play with the expansion cards and with my house rules.

I love this game.  It's one of the few deck builders that I play where I really don't care if I win or lose, I'm having fun the entire time I'm playing it.  Being a fan or being familiar with the comic helps but isn't necessary.

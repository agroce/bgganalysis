A &quot;big&quot; game in a little box. Easy to explain, also for non gamers, and good mix between strategy and luck. The game variant with face-up cards is definitely for hardgamers, but worth a try. Beautiful illustration on the box.

The vast majority of my games are played on www.youplay.it. This is my favourite PBW game - plays fast (I prefer the cards concealed version as the other is prone to too much analyis) but if anyone tells you that it is all luck you should see the stats of the top players on the site.

Sadly boring and dull. All in all, this one is just too simplistic for me. Very little strategy to it (even while playing the 'strategy' version). Still, others in my circle like it because it's easy. So there you go. But for me, it goes on the sell pile.

A good, simple, abstract game that comes with two variants in the box.  It's great to play with children from aged 4 up and teaches some simple strategy elements.  Movement-wise, it has elements of Galloping Pigs, Labyrinth and Gulo Gulo...or should I say, these have elements of this, for the story goes that there was a very old game played at actual prison of Cartagena.  Whether it was like this, we'll never know!

RATING: 6
An abstract game where you collect specific shapes in your hand and use them to propel your gang of escaped prisoners from their jail cell to the waiting boat to take them away to freedom. The game is a constant two steps forward one step back sort of flow where you are balancing the tension of delaying your movement to collect the right sets of cards to move your gang at the right time so that you both escape and minimize helping others escape before you. In order to draw cards you have to move meeples backwards until they collide with one or two others on the path. As you play symbols your meeples move to the next available symbol on the path, meaning if someone else plays the same symbol they will pass over your meeple to the next one or directly to the boat if there are no more like symbols on the path. The game plays quick, doesn't over stay its welcome but doesn't usually hold people's interest for too many plays as it feels pretty abstract and does not have a lot of complexity to it. Great warm up or wind down game but not meant to be the entree of a game night. If you play I recommend the Tortuga variant as that is more skill based.

Not a serious game in any way, but it gives you enough to occupy your brain when you need a break from heavier fare; in other words, you can relax but play is not mindless.  It's fun, especially with the rules where the draw pile is revealed.

Since receiving Quirkle, I've been thinking of creating a Quirkle-Cartagena hybrid.

Update: 8 years later, played it again. Did not seem as interesting, so is much less likely to get selected in the future.

Can be picked up easily by non-gamers or can be played in a more hardcore fashion with gamers. Works well as a kids game since the rules are pretty simple. Very similar to Hare & Tortoise.

RATING: 6
Cartagena is quite well themed; we are pirates in a prison break and we are racing along a path to a waiting boat.  However, the game play feels quite abstract.  Movement along the path is by means of playing a card and moving one of your six pirates to the next space with a symbol matching the card.  As the game progresses and the path fills up, long moves are possible and it becomes important to avoid setting up your opponents with one.  The cleverest mechanic is that you have to go back in order to move forwards; a backwards move is the only means of drawing more cards.  Despite its cleverness, I find Cartagena only moderately engaging.  There isn't quite enough going on for my taste.

The production quality is decent.  For a pirate game, the artwork is restrained and sober.  I quite like that.

Breakout your team of pirates, race them all to a nearby boat to escape Cartagena. It takes the mechanics of an older game like Candyland and transforms that sort of card based movement into something more strategic, ESPECIALLY if you play the Tortuga version of the game where cards are visible to other players and you build a row to draw from face up. This is probably the better of the two versions, but you can play the other if you want to hide your hand and draw blind from the deck.

A great racing game, much better than any other racing game I know. Plus, it's really two games in one: one (Jamaica version) for a light time-filler or to play with the family, the other (Tortuga version) a deep strategic game.

UPDATE: While I still recognize the great design behind this one, it's already worn out. I play it once in a long while (and still have fun), but it's far removed from the great games I enjoy these days. Down to a 7.

[i]Posted: 12/9/09, Rated: 9[/i]

I was first introduced to [i]Cartagena[/i] on [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/?nation=en]BrettspielWelt[/url] (BSW).  It was and is an easy game to learn: spend a card to move one of your pirates to the next empty space with the same symbol as your card, or else move your pirate back to the first spot that only has one or two pirates on it, to pick up one or two cards respectively.  It was an interesting one, but a frustrating one as I had not yet learned how to "manufacture" card-earning opportunities.

With repeated plays, I learned how to work the first part of the board, generating a lot of cards, and allowing other players to trailblaze: their pawns would pave the way for more efficient leapfrogging of my own.  [i]Cartagena[/i] rose to be a "6" or a "7" with me.

Next we explored the variations: "Jamaica" allows the players to hide the cards in their hands, and cards are drawn blindly from the deck.  "Tortuga" requires open information: players' hands are known, and a number of cards are dealt face-up from the draw pile.  "Tortuga" turns an easy game into one with many strategic considerations: do I attempt to build a "monopoly" in swords, so that I can move my pirates more effectively?  Or do I want to hang on to a few pistols, because the player to my right has a lot of them?  Analysis paralysis can creep in, but it's still a very satisfying game.  It rose to an "8."

Finally, I got a chance to play in person when I met BGG user [geekurl=/user/Javal]Javal[/geekurl] and his now-wife at a local pub.  It was a ton of fun.  And despite my nostalgic preference for the graphics I knew from BSW, the new version was quite acceptable!  I made sure to pick up a copy with my next game order.

I have since taught this game to at least twenty other people at various gatherings, and it has been a winner each time.  Being easy to learn, hiding depths of strategy, and being well-received are all hallmarks of a great game.  It has plundered a "9" rating from me, and deservedly so.

I like this game alot. Fun and fast. I prefer the version with draw cards shown. Very enjoyable.

We play 2 player by placing 1 pawn for a neutral color on each of the board pieces, each on a different symbol. This gives more options and allows for a bit faster game. Also helps reduce the chance of the lock up occuring in 2 player.

Very interesting racing game. Kinda reminds of the old classical Hare & Tortoise game, but more developed. There are quite a few tactics you can use in this game.
The skill version with the arrow card and open cards are more suited for pro players, since it makes your head ache when you try to over think all your opponents. Great fun racing game...

I liked it, but I would maybe like it a little better if a couple things were changed:

1.) More cards for going backwards.  This sort of chilled the game a bit.

2.) My wife made the mistake of getting her 4 of 6 to the boat soonest.  This made for a LONNNG game as we moved collectively down the board away from the 2 of the 6 she had remaining.  Losing is one thing, but basically being unofficially isolated out of the whole game...sucks.  She could basically just move backwards, and then go forward, and then go back, and forwards, and back, and forwards.

I've only played the visible-cards variant, and I think it's a good game to play.  I think I'd prefer it with hidden cards, since I tend not to pay too much attention to the cards of the other players, anyway.

Seems like the player who goes first is at a disadvantage.  In all our games, that's been the case, but it's possible we were not playing optimally.

EDIT. I'm right, I like the hidden cards a little more.  I just prefer that style of game.

Not a bad race game... just not one that I find myself wanting to play often.  Luck heavy.  Hand management is one of the biggest things, but your hand of cards usually is not that big and often you cannot seem to draw the right cards. It also feels a bit too simplistic for my taste... nothing to pick up on the way out... just a simple, abstract race.  **UPDATE 2005** I have lost interest in this leapfrog game.  I prefer the game called Freya's Folly.

I have only ever played the Jamaica variant where you cannot see the upcoming 12 cards and you cannot see your opponents' cards.  Jamaica is pretty chaotic and random, but the other 2 variants would be brain burners and take forever.

Un juego familiar muy sencillo. Hay que huir de una fortaleza a través de un pasillo que está jalonado de símbolos. El objetivo es ser el primero en sacar a tus seis prisioneros de allí. La forma de avanzar es mediante cartas. En cada turno, el jugador puede hacer tres acciones y solo hay dos acciones posibles: jugar una carta -> con lo cual avanzas uno de tus peones hasta el símbolo siguiente que esté libre en tu camino hacia la salida. robar carta -> para ello, debes retroceder uno de tus peones hasta la zona anterior ocupada más inmediata. Si esa zona está ocupada por un peón, robas una carta. Si por dos, robas dos cartas.
En una zona no puede haber más de tres peones.
En mi opinión, dependes mucho de la suerte que tengas con las cartas y de lo que hagan los demás jugadores, por lo que es bastante dificil planificar algo. La estrategia (que una pizca hay) reside en escoger la acción adecuada con los peones adecuados.

There's something I'm missing as I haven't won yet. The play is brilliant: the cards in your hand are the spaces on the track and you move forward to the next space of the card you play. If that space is occupied you jump to the next one, and so on. Similarly you can set up traps where your opponent moves back to the previous icon (to gain cards) doing himself harm.

We played the open-handed Tortuga version with three players. OMG, AP -- the game dragged like a fat cat. And it was highly unamusing when my brother announced, three turns ahead of schedule, that he was going to win, then forced us to play through to the bitter end anyway.

UPDATE: Tried it again on BSW, with the Jamaica version, 2p. Not much better. I'm sure there is a strategy here, but there's also a lot of random moving around.

This is a great wee game.  Some decisions to take and tactics to attempt and it plays very quickly.  What's more it's very different from just about any other game you'll try.  What more do you want?I should say that we play with the closed hands and draw from the pile version of the rules.  I can only imagine that playing with open hands and a dozen cards to chose replacements from would be much more skillful but sounds to me like it's missing the point and would suck all the fun outr of the game.

"Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion."

That's what the Geek notes for a four rating. Well, that's what it gets. Too much reminiscent of Mensch-ärgere-Dich-nicht. Arguably a game which is even worse than Monopoly. 

In short: I just don't like it.

PS: Down to 3.5. Just a bit above 3, because it ain't really BAD. But that obviously doesn't mean it's good. In my book at least.

Yes, it is like advanced Candyland. I really like this game... it's simple, smooth, light, and plays quickly but there's still a decent amount of strategy to be had. During my first play my opinion of the game gradually rose from "decent" to "I want to play again!" Watching the tension rise toward the endgame is super fun. Plays great with any number (though it feels differently with different numbers of players - with more, it's more frantic. With less, it's more calculated.) One of my favorite light games; I will play this anytime.

So far I've only played the "lucky" version of Cartagena so can only comment on that; even though I would like to play the other variant, I fear there might be AP problems which there certainly isn't in the lucky variant of the game. I think it's pretty good and you need to take a close look at where your men are positioned compared to the others - and beware that you don't position yourself in a way which enable the other players to jump lots of spaces ahead! There is also some tactical thinking when deciding who and where to move your men back in order to get cards. A decent game.

This is an extremely fun game.  The theme is even fun.  We generally have 2 players, but have also played with 4 or 5.  It works nicely with any of these numbers.  The idea of backing up in order to get cards is very clever.

RATING: 5
Cards move you forward, dropping back gets you cards. Playing a card leapfrogs you to the next unoccupied matching symbol. Get all your guys out of the tunnel first. While not offering the most interesting decisions - a surprise for a Colvini - the flow of the game is quite enchanting. I really enjoyed the feeling of the pelaton, how everyone moves faster in the group, how folks slingshot to the front but bog down, how laggards get left behind without anyone to draft off of.

Nice pirate game. Easy to play and quick. The object of the game is to escape from the tunnel before your opponents.

Simple ebb-and-flow card playing game with quite a lot of decisions to be made and a fun but thin theme. The closed hand version should be played competitively with 2 players only, but casual play with more players is fun too. The open hand version increases in difficulty with more players, and can induce AP. Still, it's short and easy to teach. Keeper.

The racing mechanic of having to go back spaces to pick up cards in order to move ahead cracks me up. This game worked well to introduce my older uncle to board games but fell a little flat when introduced to my friends who I think prefered Downfall of Pompeii and Last Night On Earth, the other gateway games I taught them. I still like the game though I imagine it would play well with kids too.

I seem to enjoy this game more every time I play - even though my husband is getting wise to the strategy and starting to beat me sometimes..  I've always loved puzzles and this appeals to that side of me - deciphering the optimal move is just a lot of fun (and no, I don't suffer from AP, but I've found that my husband sure does!  I guess that means that I suffer from HIS AP).  Recommended for anyone - easy to learn, quick to play and a great game for non-gamers.  So far we've only played the Jamaica version with the cards hidden but I'd like to try the Tortuga version with all cards exposed too.  My son is having a hard time getting into Cartagena because it really bothers him to have to move his pirates backwards in order to draw more cards.  Once he gets used to the fact that moving backwards is OK and can actually help you tremendously, I think he'll enjoy this more.
Fantastic game that I will never turn down.

Really simple race game. I like that each player has to get 6 guys across the finish line, which means that you have ot balance them, making your turns less obvious than many racing games. Playing with open/closed cards makes for a dramatically different game. I think I prefer open, if only because the game can be played in half the time. Kinda like the Domaine vs Lowenherz tradeoff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like the idea of diceless race games.  There's still a little luck in the card draw, though that can be greatly mitigated by playing the Tortuga (all cards face-up) version.  There are decisions to be made as one must balance the moves so all six pirates will be able to get to the sloop while you work to not set up great moves for the next player.  Reasonably fast game with a bit of thinking!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My experiences with Cartagena to date have been mixed. The first time I played this title I was taught by family members of my girlfriend, who played like genuine pirates: giving no quarter, and expecting none, too. Under these conditions, the simple movement mechanics offered plenty of opportunity for creative play. Based on that experience, we purchased this title. But when we opened the box and replayed this title with just the two of us... I almost fell asleep, although it took several plays some time later for me to realise the cause. You can monopolise a few symbols much more easily in the two player game, turning off interaction quite effectively. With more players, symbol contention becomes almost impossible to avoid, meaning that where one player puts his meeples can have [i]much[/i] more effect on what the other players do. The game is then much more of a fight on the edge of a knife where tiny mistakes are exacerbated to the point of quick loss. 

Although my point of eventually retrying the game with 2 (i.e., the final session where I realised what had been plagueing the game at that number) was to come up with empirical evidence that the game sucks and should be sold off, I've decided to hold on to it for a while longer. It [i]should[/i] be better with more players, and it is simple enough to have a good time with non-gamer friends and family members. If that is indeed the case, the rate will be adjusted accordingly, although it'll probably never rise beyond a 6.

Components: Simple, colorful, thematic, and distinguishable artwork for the six methods of traversing the corridors. The board is a nice linen finish, and the pawns are easy to handle. One of my pawns came without any legs.

I don't really like this game. Possibly because I am pretty lousy at it, but also because I'm not fond of games without any luck (which this game in its variant almost is). Perhaps I'd like the more luck-driven basic game a bit better, but that seems rather childish to me. The game has a huge 'presents for your left neighbour' problem, which makes it ok as a 2-player game. Update : I didn't enjoy the Jamaika-version either.

Eenvoudig, maar toch heel tactisch spel, waarbij via het uitspelen van kaarten pionnen bewogen worden naar de symbolen op een weg die met die kaarten overeenstemmen. Om nieuwe kaarten te verkrijgen dient een pion teruggezet te worden tot op een plaats waar 1 of 2 pionnen staan. Wie eerst al zijn pionnen naar de andere kant van de weg brengt is de winnaar. Het thema (piraten) komt helemaal niet uit de verf. Dit is een spelmechanisme dat op duizend verschillende manieren kan ingekleed worden. Het kon even goed toegepast worden op passagiers die de bus of de trein moeten halen.

I'm not a big fan of Hare and Tortoise, from which this game is definitely a derivative of.  I think I enjoy this game more because each player has multiple pawns to move and the board isn't static (there are some definite better and worse spaces on the Hare & Tortoise board, and eventually those games become very scripted).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial impression based on a single play of the more-luck variant, but it felt a lot like Hare & Tortoise. Rating will go up if the harder Tortuga version is more enjoyable.

Update: Got to try out the Tortuga rules and it's a much better way to play, so updating to a 7. Not necessarily that much harder, and knowing the cards to come and what your opponents have makes for better decisions and the ability to possibly thwart their plans. Only way I plan to play it from now on.

It gets samey after a couple of plays, but I can see myself returning to it every once in a while.

Configurable map tiles lay out the escape route from a prison. All players have to do is get all of their prisoners to the boat to escape first. Players do this by playing cards that match the symbols that form the path itself. Prisoners can "leapfrog" over other prisoners to achieve their goal. Brilliantly simple.

RATING: 7
A fun filler. I suspect there's a small element of "solvability" in the general strategy, but you've always got to be on your toes for tactical opportunities. I'd only play the Jamaica variant as the game isn't good enough to justify the analysis of open cards. Just play it out as a quick fun tactical game.

I love this game!  It is one of the best multi-player abstract games that I have encountered.  It is so simple that I can teach it to nongamer friends in minutes.  The only problem, is the theme is too abstract and so people enjoy it, but not as much as games that have a better matched theme such as Ticket to Ride, Carcasonne, or Settlers.  With a better theme, this would have made it as my all time favoriute light game.

I don't usually go in for abstracts, but there is something about this that really appeals to me.  Not exactly photogenic, but very nice quality of components.
Also. Strangely.  I have won this game every single time I've played it. So much so, I'm rather frightened to play it and ruin my ridiculous 30+ winning streak.

Simple and fun. Can be really frustrating if it's your first time as the game is unforgiving.

I really wish the game came with a different box, though. I feel like they could have gone with a regular square box. Instead, they opted for a long rectangular box (which matches none of my other games).

Ya know, I bet you could make CandyLand fun with these rules.  And a smaller board.  The game works, but it is so reliant on the other players' moves that you don't feel terribly in control of your own turn.  That's Life does the same kind of thing.  Maybe it works better with fewer people.

My (used-to-be) 4-year old can play this game, but she like collecting the cards (even if she doesn't need any more). I think I might implement Cartegena 2 rules, where you move other players forward (instead of yourself backwards) in order to draw cards.

A good filler that's deep enough to get your brain juices flowing, but quick enough for back to back plays come your lunch hour. I don't usually go for abstract games of this type, so I'd have rated it maybe a point lower based on gameplay alone. But the fact that there are only a couple paragraphs of rules and it plays in 30 minutes means that it will hit the table a lot, so I bumped it up. I haven't tried the Tortuga version (with face-up cards) yet, and I can't quite imagine it... seems like it would slow the game down imensely and degenerate into analysis paralysis, but I guess that depends on the players.

A classic and one of the first games we owned, Cartagena works so well because it's easy to understand, but can be challenging to play fairly well.  The fact that you must move your own piece back in order to get cards - and you don't want to set others up to do this - makes for a fun 30 minutes.

RATING: 7
Pretty good, played with the open variant. Next time, I'll play with 12 cards always available, not 12 cards dealt out at a time. That was an odd way to do it, and led to some irritating decision points. Once, a player even took cards just because he wanted to see what was coming up, not for any real tactical reason. I'd rather see it be more about the tactics.

A nice, light game.

A great entry game, perfect for the beginning of a game night. Players jump past each other on a path through a tunnel, while it is extremely simple, the satisfaction of jumping from the beginning to the end with one card is just excellent. Simple, but fun for everyone and even beginners can win.

Race game with an interesting twist: you play a card to move to the next available matching symbol, but if another piece is on the slot, you jump to the next,a nd so on - so long moves can be set up. However, you only get new cards by moving backwards, preferably onto an occupied space, so you also need to stick together.

Cartagena has simple rules, clean art and just enough theme to tie it all together. It is not deep, though there is strategy to consider when determine whether to play and move forward or reverse and draw instead.

This one has a thumb-up from several light or non-gaming groups, which is probably the best testament. Good with two but a little better with more.

When I first played this game I was expecting a certain level of excitement seeing as it's about pirates escaping. Then I played it...hmmm...I feel it is quite simple and not as exciting, except near the end, and felt a bit disappointed by that. Supposedly it's a race game but I don't feel like I'm in a race. I feel like I'm sitting around most of the time waiting to get useful cards. It's at times like this that I appreciate the great artwork. There are all these little details like torn pieces of map littered in the escape tunnel. I like the way movement works - earning cards to go forward by moving backwards - but my feeling is that it would be better? more fun? with more than 2 players. Surprisingly, my other half is totally enamoured with this. His face totally lights up when we play. [b]I[/b] never pick it because we have SO many better games that I can't get enough of and I know he'll pick it because he says it's one of his favourite games so I'm happy to play it then. However [b]he[/b] doesn't pick it either even though he says its a great game...hmmm...

Nice little game with very simple rules, but calling it an "Advanced Candyland" isn't fair to its potential for strategic play.  The Jamaica version is most suited for a light social game, but those looking for a more skillful brainburner should try the Tortuga version (where all hands and the next draw cards are played face-up).

I often recommend it to friends with children.

I was expecting a sort of race game but it felt very much like the luck of the draw, with people suddenly racing right up the track because they happened to draw a 'parrot' of the top of the deck. 
Movement was fairly reminiscent of playing hare and tortoise however when you go backwards you do not know what you are getting here as you do in hare and tortoise.
The theme completely fails to come through and gameplay is very repetitive and simple with almost no strategic depth. Disappointed in this and I don't think I will play again, even with all the rules variants etc included in the box

Fast, fun race game that's a definite improvement on Parcheesi.

Duration: This is very quick and plays are quick as long as you hustle along the players pondering their meeple positions.
Design: Drop back for cards, or move forward using cards? The rules are very simple but you get a lot of mileage out of them; with more players occupy more positions, giving more cards and allowing farther skip-ahead (which speeds things up). There are variants with more or less hidden information.
Strategy: There's a surprising amount in here for such a small game; unlikely to have much replayability when the major strategies are worked out.
Components: Pretty good card and board tile icon art.
Theme: Fundamentally this is an abstract race and the pirate theme is just decoration.

RATING: 4
Cartagena is an game where the theme doesn't realy work (pirates? yeah, right). Each player attempts to get all six of his player pawns to the end of the maze. Each maze segment has six symbols where each pawn may rest. Movement is accomplished by playing cards. If a player chooses to move a pawn to a symbol that is occupied, he skips forward to the next symbol. It that's occupied, he skips again, and so on until he gets to the end or he meets an unoccupied symbol. One gets more cards by moving a pawn backwards to an occupied symbol. The Jamaican variant offers too little control; the Tortuga variant tends to devolve into Analysis Paralysis and boredom, especially for a game of this weight. The sparse, gloomy presentation of the game doesn't help. Finally, if everyone plays rationally, it's a matter of denying the player following you any good moves. This can drag the game out to unbearable lengths. Cartagena is par for the course for Leo Colovini, and it can appeal to those in the mood for a themeless brain-burner, but its audience is likely to be fairly narrow. (Besides, didn't this game take its main mechanism from the venerable Hase & Igel?)

RATING: 7
Fun game, even though I lost.  Definitely want to play another game, and Mr. Billington agrees (he won).  Mr. B and I played the game again (this time correctly following the rules) and I won.  We both agreed that it didn't matter who won, because the game is fun.  Another game (on 4-30-2011 - I lost), where I decided to use 12 pieces per player (each player chooses 2 of 5 colors and has 6 pieces per color) and 10 cards starting cards per player.  I thought it would make it easier.  It actually made a little bit more challenging.  Might play it again that way next time.

Modular board.  Pirate theme.  Nice wooden bits.  Strategy coming out of every pore.  This is a sweet little game.  I have only played a flurry of games with 2 playing -- I can only imagine the strategy and intensity ramps up HUGELY when playing with the full field.  It's sort of a minimalist Hare & Tortoise.  And that's a wonderful, wonderful thing.  A game of beauty, whose rating will only likely go UP (though there's not far for it to go) with future plays.

Cartagena is elegant simplicity at its best. On a turn players move their pawns to the next symbol matching their played card, skipping any intervening covered symbols of the same type. Whenever a player needs more cards they simply move one of their cards backwards. Whomever gets all of their pawns to the end first wins. I love this game more than my family, but they indulge me from time to time.

Getting your team ahead is important, but it's more important not to help your opponents. Don't forget stragglers - any member separated enough from the group has a hard time to catch up.
I recommend the strategic variant, where all the cards are open. For kids and new players, the more random closed version is probably better.

If this was food, Cartagena would be a nice chicken sandwich. Not bad when you just want a sandwich. But it certainly isn't a nice juicy steak - but it wasn't designed to be. 
So, when you just want a sandwich, bite into this one!

RATING: 7.858
Only one play, but I sense a good gateway game for non-gamers and a reasonable filler at the end of the night for gamers (26/1/11). UPDATE: Good solid game and one of the better gateway games to introduce people to the hobby.  After a few games, experienced gamers will quickly get the core of the system, and despite the fact you can have variable board setups, it will for more experienced gamers end up on auto-pilot.  This is not a bad thing, as it promotes the social chatter or can be used as an evening ender after a particularly intense main game.   For me, the rating is now a 6 as i have played it enough, but It's always fun to introduce it to new gamers (noobie rating 8).  So, on average, a 7 rating (29/11/11). UPDATE: This is one of my go to games for newbies, as its a really different mechanism from standard card games, and the modular nature of the board also shows you can have games wih diffent setups (so they require slightly different strategies. So, updated rating with that context (Rating 7.858, Sept 16)

Meh. I've only ever liked one of Colovini's games (Carolus Magnus) and unfortunately Cartagena goes on my 'don't like' list. It's simple enough that maybe it's a kid's game? But it requires too much game-state analyzing for what is a very simple game. And it requires too much luck it in terms of what cards you draw. And it requires too much good timing for where other player pieces are when it is your turn and you need to draw cards. There is an "advanced" version for adults which in essence allows for more strategy but in the end just makes the game unnecessarily longer. This definitely feels like a game where the designer came up with an interesting integrative idea for movement vs card acquisition (it is, at the very least, interesting) but didn't really accept that it's not very fun in practice. Player progress is so dependent on where other players are and where you end up that you're sort of forced to analyze player positions every time to make sure you are not leaving your opponents with an advantage. And I really don't want to do that much analysis for a game that should feel super fluid, given its depth. Oh well, I'm glad I got to try it considering it is his highest-rated game!

I've played this game a lot. It's easy to teach and easy to play (badly) so I've used it as a gateway game many times. I'm a bit over it now, but I think the Tortuga (open draw pile) variant will keep it alive for me for a while longer.

A fun light gateway game I use a lot (and successfully ;-)) to lure - er, introduce - non-gamers to the hobby. Simple rules belie the tactical depth that this game offers, and all the bickering and moaning and c'mon-man-be-a-sport that  happen naturally from the rules are always fun to watch.

RATING: 7
My first Colovini experience, and one that has propelled him into being one of the most interesting designers in my opinion.  Catagena is in no way a masterpiece, however it has the qualities that make it an almost must play every time a group gets together.  Why?  Because it offers a lot of game and fun in a little amount of time without being a brain burner.  I find even myself surprised at my claims as Colovini has practically just updated Candyland in this offering.  Yet, something just clicks with me in this game.  I am surprised the number of comments claiming the low interaction in Cartagena, as I find everyone's move has major effect on all player's position and choice. Plus, even though the pirate theme is loosely applied it still speaks to the inner child and therefore transcends what most believe to be a dry abstract racing game.  The variant option to play with cards face up adds a little more strategy to this game yet in no means is necessary.

Cartagena var et af de spil vi fik relativt tidligt, da vi begyndet at spille for alvor. Et lille, hyggeligt og alligevel benhårdt spil. Da vi for nyligt genspillede spillet fandt det ikke nåde i hele familien, men jeg må indrømme at jeg stadig syntes designet holder. Bestemt et spil jeg vil have det fint med at finde frem selvom der selvfølgelig er kommet mange andre interessante spil til siden vi første gang spille Cartagena.

[Original comment] I have played this game online and on the table. Both ways are fun. At the table, I've played only with two players (as of February 2006). It is an excellent game for 2 -- very simple rules, quick-playing, but can involve a bit of tactical decision-making. A player can appear to be way behind, and can play the cards needed to surge ahead. Games can be very close-finishing (or not -- my grandson beat me 6 to 1 in one game).

2007 - Played with four players and enjoyed it very much. I can play this one anytime.

May 2009 -- We played this a couple of times recently and had fun. I still enjoy it.

October 2011 -- I haven't played this in some time, but will always enjoy a game of it.

2013-November: We recently played this with 5 players, and enjoyed it once more.

Homemade from formica sample tiles in 6 primary colors, six of each, and an appropriate number of Candyland cards. Laying out the formica is fun, and it creates a solid and satisfyingly tactile playing surface whose variability is orders of magnitude higher than the retail version. Good game, with nice balance between interactive race and solitary puzzle.

A little strategy, a little luck a little chaos allot of fun.  Excellent light filler game.  It is not good to allow one or two of your pawns to get way ahead or way behind the other pawns.  It is best to move forward with a herd and then try to out maneuver the other players in the last leg.

Cartagena is a fun, light game that offers options for a more luck-driven or a more strategy-driven experience. The theme is cute but superficial. The modular board and copious numbers of cards help prevent predictability. Setup is fast, but the half-size cards can be a bit hard to randomize.

The more I play this game, the more I wonder at the target audience. Kids (my kid at least) can't grasp the group strategy. It can't really be played two player with a spouse and be much fun. There are better filler games for gamers. Ergo, this game is a skip for my family.

Not a bad lightweight game, actually. Fun little game if you're just relaxing with some friends. I don't think I'd be interested in playing by the Tortuga rules, however; Jamaica all the way. If you want something with some real depth, this isn't it. It's like a game where you play leapfrog with several tokens and try to get them all to the destination before anyone else.

Bought this to play with my kids (4 and 6 y.o. at the time). They were already familiar with the skipping mechanism from Hoot Owl Hoot!, so the main challenge for them is learning how to get cards. My oldest handles the game well, though she doesn't play optimally; the younger needs a bit more guidance and prompting to notice good opportunities to get cards, but she understands the game. The kids enjoy setting up the board before play. With the younger we play semi-cooperatively: we're each responsible for getting our own pirates on the boat, but the boat doesn't leave until everyone is on board and we all win/escape together.

While not not most fun game in our collection, Cartagena has a nice puzzly aspect to efficiently gaining additional cards, some strategy in trying to keep your pirates close enough together to take advantage of opportunities to skip ahead, and some excitement when you are able to make a big move. I think it works well for families playing with young children playing together.

I also appreciate that there's a more advanced variant included with an additional board segment and pirate, and in which you take three actions per turn. This makes the game better for adults, giving players more control.

I have played this a few times now.  2 - 5 players.  It's pretty good as a filler game.  There is some strategy involved in how you play your cards and when to play them as opposed to acquiring more.
Just played the newer version with the advance your opponent to gain more cards instead of moving yourself backwards to do so.  My experience was also positive.  I think I like it better the new way, but I'm not sure how it would play with 2 players.

Παιχνίδι λογικής με κάρτες. Απλό στους κανόνες,αλλά πιο βαθύ στις αποφάσεις από ότι του φαίνεται. Τρομερό με λίγους παίκτες, χαοτικό με περισσότερους. Για παίκτες που δεν θέλουν να έχουν πολλές επιλογές στις αποφάσεις και γ' αυτούς που έχουν το ταλέντο να σκέφτονται δυο κινήσεις μπροστά. Υπάρχει ο παράγοντας τύχη σχετικά με το τι κάρτες έχει ο αντίπαλος και τι τραβάς. Συμπεριλαμβάνεται ωστόσο variant που το διορθώνει. Προσωπικά, το έχω λιώσει.

Card-based race game reminiscent of Hare & Tortoise, but better.  Deeper than it appears.  I have a strong preference for the Tortuga version (with the open cards), which emphasizes planning ahead and diminishes the importance of the card draw.  I've never found the game to bog down in analysis paralysis - a common complaint against the Tortuga version.  Cartagena arrived at about the same time as Carcassonne, and I think it suffered because its superficial similarities caused people to compare it to Carcassonne.  Both were small-box German games in the same price range.  Both were quick-playing light/mid-weight games.  Both had little painted wooden people that were placed on a "board" made up of tiles.  And most people preferred Carcassonne.  I do, too, but Cartagena has really grown on me.

Almost a filler game, it plays in 30 to 45 minutes and is not that deep, but is quite fun.

Moving forward is great, but if you want cards you have to move backwards to get them. Moving backwards efficiently so that you get the maximum out of opportunities and don't leave big opportunities for your opponents is the key to this one. If you move a token back into a cluster of 2 other tokens, you get 2 cards and no one else can land on that spot ...etc.

2005 acquisition.

Played 1 game with my sister and it didn't really grab us much so it hasn't hit the table since.  I wouldn't mind giving it another go but there's just simply too many games to play.

I've now played this several times with the other half and it works quite well as a couple game, being quick, random (assuming you play the Jamaca rules), and non-confrontational.  However, it seems that going second gives you a slight advantage and it may be something to consider when deciding who to go first in a couple's game.

I love this game. Every time I introduce it, people are like, oh, it's a race game, cool. Then after 2 turns they are like, oh, wait, I don't have any cards any more.  :)

Yep, because in order to go forward, you must go backwards. That's the only way to gain more cards. So if you want to be first to escape, you have to manage your moving backwards steps to gain most cards, to plan to jump ahead, onto the board and escape from Cartagena!! Excellent game.

It's two steps forward, and one step back -- literally! You'll play cards to move your pirates forward, and move your pirates backwards to gain cards.

RATING: 6
As a lover of racing games, I came in with expectations that were probably a bit too high. It's a very simple game with only a few strategic rules to follow that become clear very quickly. There is a clear inspiration here from Candyland, believe it or not. In light of that, you know there isn't going to be a lot of depth. 

Players will try to get all their pirate meeples from the one end of the board and into the boat. They do this by playing cards from their hands which match symbols on the board. If a symbol is occupied, you will use the next symbol. This means that a player can move many spaces ahead by blocking symbols that to which they hold matching cards. The only way to draw cards, however, is to move backwards to the next spot containing another piece. This element is the most interesting decision you will make, but it also quickly becomes clear how to set yourself up to optimize this. 

This game quickly becomes all about luck of the draw and multiplayer chaos. The mechanic of moving backwards for gains is done much better in Hare & Tortoise than here. There's really no reason to play Cartagena when that excellent title is also available.

Home made, Hand painted. "Dobjunk egy sárgát, barnát". Sokat bíbelődtem vele, a tárgyak egyszerű színek. Jó játék, nem egyszerű nyerni benne, az utolsó pillanatig nehéz megjósolni, hogy ki lesz a győztes. Hajlamos lehet a játékos sokat gondolkodni rajta, de ez kiküszöbölhető.

RATING: 6
This is a fun filler game.  You have to remember not to leave a pirate near the end of the path, otherwise other player's pirates will leapfrog over him and directly into the boat too easily.  Opening up gaps in a chain of claimed symbols is a good tactic.

The game takes less than 10 minutes to teach and setup. It is an easy game to learn, but involves a good deal of strategy and planning your turns ahead of time. The less players you have the more "thinky" it becomes. We bought it on a whim and because it sounded like a neat filler game, but it really surprised me when we played. It is a great little game with a lot of replay value as well.

RATING: 7
Taking simplicity to it's extremes (almost to the verge of abstraction), Cartagena creates an interesting little game with a decent theme out of a historic prison break by pirates in the 17th century and makes something simple enough to enjoy with the family a fun, somewhat fascinating and compelling game.

The basic mechanism is chaining together the most efficient steps for your pirates' forward progress, while denying the same access to escape to your opponents.

The simple card based movement is ionly slightly more complicated than Candyland, yet the layers of placement, movement, and card collection make it very enjoyable.

Based on a 1st 2-player game, I'm starting this at a 7. While I wouldn't expect it move much from there, it's possible, especially with the open hand Tortuga variant.

"Candy Land for gamers"

You move one of your pawns to the next available XXX symbol space based on the card used, so similar to Candy Land in that aspect. Only there is some actual strategy here. You have three actions on your turn, you have a hand of cards, you have to get all of your guys to the end to win, and oh--the ONLY way to draw cards is to move one of your pawn backwards.

"Candyland with (some) strategy" is a pretty apt description for this one. Certainly, it's important to figure out what the people behind you will do with what you leave for them, and balancing drawing cards with moving forward is a nice decision.

Cartagena is a big, fat "So What?" for me.  The game seems to devolve into a wait for the other players to line up your move for you type game which isn't exactly exciting.

Apparently all you need to escape from prison is a couple of hats and a skull.  The game is either play a card (and move a piece to the next available space of that type) or move a piece backwards and draw a card.  With simple rules, this game is great for teaching younger kids how to play and at the same time leaving enough of a challenge for adults playing a little more strategically.

My wife enjoys light games, so I get to play a lot of them (usually with only two players).  This one is not bad, but is not particularly great either.  Once you learn to convoy your men along in groups of 2 0r 3 they can efficiently march through the maze without you depleting you cards.   This  occurs until near the end of the maze where heavy defensive play by both players is needed to avoid a loss, but many turns go by with little progrees for the players causing the endgame to drag heavily.  

This must be the DRYEST pirate game ever.

Played with the "Tortuga" rules, there are some fairly difficult tactical decisions to be made in this light, pirate-themed chase game, but it's difficult to develop a consistent strategy(at least for me).  This can lead to analysis paralysis, which is particularly ridiculous in a game where the player who looks most like a pirate gets to go first.  If everyone plays fairly quickly, the game is good light fun with just enough meat.

This game reminds me of "Hare & Tortoise" a little bit, both are good games that require forethought and defensive & offensive strategy. It's also a pretty quick game(under 1/2 hour). Definitely play the Tortuga version. I just wish they had a real place to start, like a cell.

Pirates are excaping prison.  This is a hand-management game with play similar to (cough..cough) Candyland.  The hand-management and race portions of the game make the game very strategic, and the game is a lot of fun.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2017)

When I began playing boardgames, I had a high desire to play Cartagena but I never did. After some years, my gaming tastes changed a lot and my desire to do so now was very low, still, the opportunity arose and I played Cartagena this month. As I expected the game is very simple and not for me.

The rules of the game are pretty simple, you can explain them under 5 minutes. Playtime is also quick, it is less than 60 minutes with the full complement of 5 players.

The game´s components and art are ok. The modular board looks gorgeous on the table.

The theme is pasted on, but in any case, I heavily dislike pirate themes.

The decisions needed to play the game aren’t complex, they are pretty simple, but not outright obvious, there is room for clever play which was unexpected and welcomed. There is a high luck factor with the cards and the king making is huge as well, you depend entirely on the opportunities that the player to your right leaves open.

Bottom line, Cartagena is a light game, perfect for the family or to introduce new gamers to our hobby, but it is too simple for me. The luck factor is very high. Mostly tactics. My desire to play it again is very low as are most if not all Colovini games. I, generally, dislike racing games.

This has been a surprise hit with our group. 

It's light, fast, and super easy to learn/teach. 

It has an interesting mechanic for movement and card drawing. There are some very interesting decisions and strategies available and nobody ever seems to be completely out of the game until the very end.

Not a lot of depth but a great filler game!

Very good family game; much better than Sorry, Shoots and ladders etc. How do such simple rules result in such frustration and brain-burning?  I like how the closer you come to winning, the harder it becomes. I like how there isn't a single word in any of the components, so the youngest of children can play too. I played with an 8yo and liked it, but was surprised there was enough there for a light game with my wife when we were too tired for our usual fare. Expertly designed to be just what it is and no more--which is much harder to accomplish than it seems. Is Honey Bears a relative of this game?

A pleasant racing game with an obvious bend towards hoarding cards which may cause us to implement a hand limit as a houserule.  This game is light, easy to learn and a whole lot-o-fun to play.  There are 2 version of play to choose from which give this game lasting replayability.  The popular 'Jamaica' version uses concealed cards and is more luck based while the 'Tortuga' version is much more challenging using exposed cards.

Because I'm cheap and have too much time on my hands, I didn't actually purchase this game, but created my own re-themed version with teams of ninjas competing to become the Emperor's personal assassins by sneaking across the village to his palace. It's not like the "pirates escaping a prison" story was essential to the gameplay. Anyway, it was fun. As easy to learn as Ticket to Ride, but with more strategy and interaction. I also like how there are two difficulty levels: one with random draws and secret hands of cards, and one with draw cards laid out face up and open hands. You can even make a third level, with secret hands and open draws. Check it out and buy (or make) your own.

RATING: 8.2
I'll start by saying that I was quite surprised by the strategy in this game.  I was thinking this was going to be sort of like a stretched out version of Labyrinth but, I was certainly wrong.  We played the "Tortuga" version of the game, meaning we played with all cards open to players and I feel like I wouldn't ever want to play it any other way.  I really like how everything works with moving forward and skipping icons other players are on, as well as the way to pick up additional cards with moving back to pirates behind you.  I really enjoy this game a lot and would love to try it out again.

Smart race game that can bog down with people that tend to over analyze. I like the mechanic of having to move backwards in order to get cards necessary to move forwards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The leapfrog nature of this game is quite interesting, the theme is nice, and the rules aren't too bloated.  Unfortunately, the best strategy (in 2-player anyway) seems to be keeping all your guys together moving nowhere while collecting cards, then making a mad dash for it at the end when you have enough.  This seems an extremely artificial way to win, but a devastatingly effective strategy.  The 3  player variants are more interesting, since you are pretty much obliged to stay with the pack, but unfortunately the winner is usually the person who plays after the worst player.

This is my second Colovini design, following Clans. Very different games, and yet my reaction is much the same. Ostensibly you can play these games with more than two players, but I don't know why you would, as they shine brightly with the added move-countermove aspect. Both are highly abstract games with quirky themes, although here the gameplay fails utterly to evoke a prison break. You have a hand of cards with symbols on them (bottle, hat, key, etc). Each symbol matches a set of spaces on the board. You play cards - quite strategically - to manage your progress and impede the progress of your opponent. I could see playing a fair amount of this but I have no idea who I'd play with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Play cards that match items on the path. If pawns are already on the item you can skip that space. Move backwards onto one pawn to gain one card or onto two pawn to gain two cards. Be the first to get to the ship at the end of the path to win. Simple to learn, but plenty of strategy. Lots of fun.

Can be fun, but very frustrating/lopsided is there is a bad player in the mix. The person after them has a HUGE advantage...after more plays, I don't think I'll ever play this with more than 2, unless I wasn't playing serious, like with kids.

Quite a nice 2-player game though. Easy to teach, some tough choices.

Few rules make this small tactical game accessible for non-gamers as well. It is much better with open cards online though than face to face where it is usually played with hidden cards.

Like most of Colovini's games, completely laughable theme, but the graphic design is decent.  It feels similar to Hare & Tortoise, in that you need to move backward at times, though here it seems like you need to do it more often.  I'm not quite sure what the winning strategy is, but it seems like you need a lucky combination of cards as well as the opportunity to move backward just a little bit to pick up the maximum number of cards.  This is very simple and easy to play the game and seems like it would be a good intro for new gamers.  The cardstock is the worst I've ever seen - truly ridiculous production values.

This game is ok, but nothing to write home about.  Someone in my game group often refers to it as adult candyland which is somewhat accurate.  I'm beginning to hate card games as much as I used to hate dice just because I'm tired of sitting there hoping for a specific type of card and unable to draw it.  It limits your strategy a little too much for my taste.

Leo Colovini has a reputation of developing cold games where the gears are nearly visible - this is one of those games. That being the case it's still my favorite pirate themed game because ... well ... tacked-on pirate prison break theme or not, it's a good game when every other pirate-themed game hasn't been worth it and people would hate it if it _wasn't_ a pirate game. Cartagena is simple enough and intuitive enough that it can be explained in about 5 minutes. This means that one can play Cartagena in the same time one could probably _learn_ how to play Caylus. 

Most games tend to be very, very close affairs - some people like this because it keeps all players interested, whereas others dislike this because it alludes to a lack of player choice or an optimal strategy. My personal opinion is that this game has very few overly punishing moves but definitely rewards those with apt foresight. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game which appears to be rather simple but really has some strategic depth.  A skilled player will definitely have an advantage as this is not just a luck-based game.  There's a rhythm to moving your pirates along the path and hitting that rhythm is key to movement.  Until you recognize that rhythm you're only going to stumble along.

A quick race game with a surprising amount of depth.

Bought this because I felt bad about trading off Atlantis, which we thought was decent. Something about the tug of war mechanics just made it seem like too much of a chore for us, especially with two people. The fact that there are so many ways to set up the map makes replay value good (and the map holds a significant advantage over Atlantis in that regard - Atlantis is just random tiles and so you can have wildly unbalanced gameplay there whereas Cartagena seems to have done a good job of balancing the symbols). At the end of the day, this game is not worth the sometimes high prices it fetches...maybe worth $10 tops.

Be the first to get all 6 of your pirate pawns to the boat to win the game.  You move a pirate to the next available spot with the same symbol as the card played OR move a pirate backwards to the next pawn to draw either one card if only one pawn there or two cards if two other pawns are there.  Keep moving backwards if three pawns are there already.  Take three actions on your turn of those two options.  Easy to pick up and play.

One of the best "gateway games" I have found to play with non gamers. Rules are simple and easy to explain, there is enough strategy for gamers and non gamers to both enjoy. I have played the game with a five year old who easily understand the concept and most of the strategy. Overall this is another Colovini great!

My first try at an abstract game and I really enjoyed it. Mechanics were simple and each to teach. Theme was light but it worked, I kept screaming ARRRRR when I'd move a pirate on his getaway ship or wish scurvy upon my opponents men when they'd escape. This one makes me want to check out some of Colovini's other games.

RATING: 7.6
AKA “Advanced Candyland.”  Cartagena has the simplest rules of any game I like.  That’s a very good thing, since it means I can teach the rules in less time than it takes for someone to say that they don’t want to learn a new game.  It can be played competently by small (age 4) children, and yet takes a good feel for the game to play well.

Played only on BSW.  Rating is for Tortuga variant.  I'd rate Jamaica a 6.

UPDATE: I'm dropping this to a 5.5, since I have hardly played it at all over the last several months.  There's nothing really wrong with the game, it just doesn't call to me.

UPDATE: dropped to a flat 5. I haven't played in ages, and don't miss it at all.

I'd rate this higher if the rules mentioned that you can move a guy backwards *off* of the boat! This becomes necessary if you have 2 guys behind everyone else (you're unlikely to ever catch up!), and can be a useful strategic move at other times.

Plays quick, different every time, strong tactical elements... what's not to like?  Okay, it's a little abstract for my taste, at least in terms of how it plays.

RATING: N/A
Cartagena 1 seems to be preferred over Cartagena 2.

However, it appears that you can play C1 with slight modifications to C2. Were both games to be played with great frequency, I would from the get go buy version C2 and play both. However, given that it is more likely that C1 will be played, I should buy C1. Then if it seems that C2 gains interest, I can always buy C2 and trade or sell C1.

This entry (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/135233/how-about-cartagena-i) describes the difference between the 2 as follows: 
C1: 6 designs x 17 cards each
C2: 7 designs x 15 cards each (PLUS 1/15 of each design has a gold border that requires all players to discard down to 7 cards)

It would seem that if one ignores the gold border, you could play C1 with C2, BUT you will have 2 less cards per design which MAY make a difference.

One of my favorite light games. The two variants make it more strategic or more random dependign on what mood you're in. Nice compnents, although the second edition cards are flimsy.  It has the pirate meeples though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Hall of Fame material - what an elegant design! I can't think of any type of gamer who would NOT enjoy this game. And at long last Ravensburger have given it the material design it deserves.
(I applaud their decision to get rid of the variant with open cards - which is nothing but an AP-fest - in this new edition.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
Elegant and very clever racing game.  Easy to teach, challenging to master.  Some luck, but player's skill can offset luck.  Fast.  The pirates theme has nothing to do with the game but I guess it's funny.  A wonderful filler that provides a good challenge.  Reminiscent in some ways of Gravwell, because of the need to yo-yo back and forth with a certain rhythm to create a slingshot effect and of hopscotch.  A hidden gem that could be overlooked because of the bad/cheap presentation and deceptively simple rules.

I love games like this that are designed so elegantly and so well.  2p game, me and Miles and he was able to pull off the win.  We both liked it a lot and I can tell it will be hitting the table very often.  We will likely continue to play the version w/hidden info rather than all cards face up since we like some luck in our games.

RATING: 6
This rating is for the... Jamaica variant, I think.  Whichever is the luck one, as opposed to the strategic one, as I've only played that one.

Cartagena is a fun, light, filler game, using resource management in the form of actions.  You can move your pirates forward but spend cards to do so; you replace cards by moving backwards.  Efficiently combining the two while preventing your opponents from doing the same is the key to victory.  It's short and the luck version doesn't take a lot of brain power, so it's great when you have a little time to kill and can't agree on a meatier game to play.

Fun idea, but in the one game I've played I felt like there weren't enough interesting decisions that I could be making. Add to that the fact that it's pointless to even bother looking at the board until your turn, and I found myself disappointed overall. I'd like to play it more (maybe with 3 instead of 4) as it felt like there might be more to it once I got the hang of it more.

RATING: 5
Cartagena is a very light racing game.  It has a modular board, that you put together any which way you want, to create a tunnel for your incarcerated pirates to escape through.  The idea is that they've been thrown into the island prison of Cartagena, and have burrowed under the building.  So, now they're attempting to push past each other to get to the rowboat waiting for them.

Players have a hand of cards with various symbols on them.  The symbols on the cards match symbols on the board.  On your turn you play a card and move one of your pirates to the closes unoccupied matching symbol on the board.  If you run out of cards in your hand you have to move a pirate back to where other pirates are sitting on a space, and can take as many cards as there are pirates on that spot.  This back-and-forth continues until a player is the first to get all his pirates into the waiting rowboat.

Cartagena is, as I said, super light.  It would be a good game to play with young children.  For me though, there just wasn't enough going on to keep me interested for more than a few plays.

This game is interesting. Some nights I'm like, "nah", and other nights I get giddy about playing this one. I think this one gets its bad rap (lower than deserved rating) because it requires a LOT of thought... I mean, chess-like contemplation of your next 4 potential moves and playing the game in advance in your head. My wife and I play this game in silence, as we are so focused on the game and doing spatial reasoning and planning in our heads. Players definitely are influenced by others, but you won't be getting much interaction or interesting conversation from this one due to its Brain-burning mechanics and significant analysis-paralysis. But like I said, this one calls my name from time to time and winning this game actually feels like an accomplishment!

I enjoyed this game.  It is very different from any other game I own so it adds a nice variety.  My husband was complaining about it the whole time and then ended up winning, so I think for him the jury is still out.  We played it the Jamaca rules, and it seemed like just the right amount of thinking/luck that a game of that sort should have.

I really like this game.  I'm moving my rating up to a 9.  It really is just the right amount of luck and thinking for the amount of time it takes.  It fits my sweet spot quite well.

I still have yet to win this game, My husband has won evergame but one.  But I still love it.

I finally won. :D  And it wasn't even close.

(Played with hidden cards) I like games that blend luck with strategy and, while this does that, it leans quite heavily toward luck in the card draw, the way the person in front of you played, and whether the others are paying attention to who can win.  Fine -- quick to teach -- but kind of a yawn.

In Cartagena, you use the other players for your own good.  Without the other, there is no escape and someone has to take advance, sooner or later.  Will it be you?

This is a real nice game to play with people that are "really not so much in to games". It turned a couple of my friends around to active gameplayers.

Not a "gamer's game" but usually good for a nice intermezzo.

Also quite easy to take along on holiday or to a bar, one elastic band around the boardparts, one around the cards and it fits into a big pocket.

Lightweight, but usually still tense enough & usually quite fun to play.

NL: Vlot, leuk & makkelijk uit te leggen voor 2-5 spelers. Dit is het spel wat dat vreselijke "Mens erger je niet" had moeten zijn. De "open" variant is nog aardig taktisch ook. Ook leuk spel voor beginners.

I didn't think I'd like this one when I read over the quite simple rules and kept delaying a purchase.  When I finally got it on the table, it actually turned out to be quite good!  Very fun and fast play.  You'll get to know some "strategy" as you play more, but it's all rather speedy going.  Only played with 3-people, but 5-players looks like it may be a little crowded.

RATING: 6.5
An enjoyable and light race game where players have a hand of cards with symbols on them and set up routes between Cartagena and the escape boat. You play a card and move one of your pawns to the next empty place with that symbol towards the boat, leapfrogging that symbol everywhere it has a piece on it. There's also an interesting mechanic where you move pieces backwards in order to draft extra cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Easy to teach, fast to learn and fast to play.

While there are some strategic decisions to make you - most of all - have to find out the best timing. Furthermore, you have to keep an eye on the supply cards on offer and which cards are being drawn by your opponents.

Seem to play well with any number of players + cheap game.

I have not played this in awhile because I lost my copy, but I loved this game.  I preferred playing this with perfect information (I cannot remember which variant that was).  The choices were great but the game itself was not hard to grasp.  The complexity greatly depends on the skill of the players, which is why I find this a good match for a mixed group.  It can be a little dull for people who do not enjoy the concept as you only do one thing throughout the game.

This game was introduced at the regular work lunch-time game sessions and despite finishing stone motherless last in every game I have played so far i still enjoy it.

I rate this as a fun filler, or something to enjoy over a lunchtime. Not a first-choice game for me by any stretch of the imagination, but one I would be unlikely to knock back if some-one else was keen.

Probably not one I'd purchase, but one I would play again.

RATING: 7
A nice little filler to play with kids and non-gamers that gives you the illusion of making strategic decisions.  Most of the decisions are very tactical given the state of the board when your turn comes around. I've only played the closed cards version so I'm sure the open card version would make the game more strategic (but much more ponderous?).

Két verzióban játszható: az egyikben pakliból húzunk kézbe lapot, a másikban minden játékos lapja és a következő 12 lap is (tehát minden információ) látszik. Mondanom sem kell, hogy utóbbi módon játszom, szinte teljesen mellőzve a szerencsét. Ugyan még csak két fővel próbáltam, ezzel a verzióval remek taktikai játéknak tartom. A laphúzás pedig mindig nehéz döntés elé állít (vissza kell lépni), és ez adja a játék sava-borsát.

This game is just so clean and intuitive. It's very simple to understand and can be enjoyed in both a family setting and just among adults. I am a big Colovini fan, so I guess it's no surprise that I was taken so quickly with this design. It has really stood the test of time and I think should be a staple in every family game closet. Haven't tried the sequel yet but would love to soon!

I admire Colovini's inventive mechanisms that make each of his games unique. Cartagena's catch-up mechanism, where you need to stay behind for the great leap, reminds me about Power Grid but here it's implemented in a shorter and more streamlined escape game. When do you need to move back to get more cards? When is the time to start spending your cards and rush towards the goal? Only you can decide. A great gateway game!

Very nice, simple game to play with kids.  I'd guestimate 7 - 12 as the appropriate age range.  I've played with my two daughters 9 and 12, and we enjoy it.  It also brings back memories of our time in Germany, because that is where the girls first encountered this game.

The idea of conserving cards by moving pieces backwards is a little bit tricky for my 9 y.o. to hang on to.  She will typically spend all of her cards moving forward, and then lose a lot of ground to get new cards.  I think that the theme just barely works for my 12 y.o.  For her the game is essentially an abstract problem, and she's at the age where drama and action are more appealing.  With three, the game can drag on just a little bit.  Our 30 minute games are just right, but our hour games (yes, they've occurred) aren't worth what the game offers.

Theme is based on pirates breaking out of jail and making it to a boat to escape. It&#039;s light, easy, but the fun factor wasn&#039;t in it for me. I&#039;m not sure if it was the racing aspect, or the lack of control that bothered me.

A fun little game! Plays quickly and the rules are ultra-simple.  For these reasons, a very good game to introduce non-gamers to the boardgaming hobby (Jamaica rules only, of course).  This is also a nice game to play with the little ones -- I introduced it to my 4 year-old nephew, and he likes it!  Oddly enough, we play the 'Tortuga' version (with face-up cards, so I can give him advice), though I much prefer 'Jamaica' (hidden cards) with adults.  He likes to send his pirates to 'get a drink' (of rum, naturally), and finds the skulls just a little bit scary ;-)  Little kids have short attention spans, but the beauty of Cartagena is that it is easily scaled to a shorter/simpler game by using fewer pawns and/or fewer tunnel tiles.  This game has many excellent qualities, and belongs in any collection!

Nice little game I hope to improve with repeated playings.  Played first time with 2 people, found that the board was pretty spartan.  Expect to work better with more people to leapfrog.

Just for the minute it takes to teach it, Cartagena delivers half an hour (if not longer) of speedy, cutthroat playing - there might be an influence of luck in the draws, but after several plays you get to know how to turn it around for your own profit. While not tremendously difficult (a bit like a streamlined Hare & Tortoise), Cartagena offers some tricky decision making and constant suspense (wins are seldom easy) every round of play -an incredibly refreshing game.

[Pity that in the new editions the board can't be made up - while it might avoid some very long moves it sadly takes away some of its cheeky aura]

Gioco simpatico e veloce. Ottimo filler con regole semplici e dinamiche carine, secondo me perfetto per partite in famiglia. Il gioco ha anche un fondo di strategia, anche se la pesca delle carte spesso risulterà determinante. Le dinamiche alla lunga diventano ripetitive ma il gioco è godibile. A mio avviso da giocare in 2, 3 giocatori, in troppi diventa ancora più casuale.

I enjoy racing games and pirate-themes so when I came across this game I was sure to like it.  Right? You bet!  Brightly coloured wooden pirate-shaped playing pieces, beautiful board and card artwork combined with simple rules and strategic decisions each round make this game a winner for me.  Other positives include it being easy to teach, a short playing time, good scalability from 2 to 5 players and the option of having your cards face up or face down. I've played both the Tortuga (face up)and Jamaica (cards face down) versions and enjoy them both.

A game I thoroughly enjoy as a 20 minute psuedo-filler everytime I play. The balance between falling back to collect resources and the imperative to take advantage of other people's positioning with big forward moves, without setting up the next player for even bigger moves, loads the game with lots of taut decisions in a short timeframe.

Cool Simple-to-learn Race Game. Abstractish, but forgiveable because of the good feel of the gameplay. Feels like a bit like Igel Ärgern, but is much better. Not great 2-player.

I like this better than Backgammon and Parchisi for a family game.

Family Game!! Casual Game!! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!! Gateway game-ish.

Very nice game from Colovini. I like this! I don't know but I seem to like this abstract games more and more the more games I play! Where will this road lead? ;)
Finally I bought Cartagena II! So this game won't see much play in the future!
Update: This game is still much fun after so many years. A keeper and therefore I rise my rating.

A short game that has a pretty interesting mechanics. Good for a filler but if you are looking for a pirate game, Cartagena does not fill that requirement for other than a pirate theme, it has nothing else to do with pirates. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very light racing game that has a strong hand-management mechanic: you have to move *backwards* to draw new cards, so picking your spots is really essential.  The game is very easy to teach and learn, and the pirate theme, while tacked-on, is appealing to many.  A good filler.

Good little filler game. Use it to warm up your players as they arrive for the main event of the evening. Nice little meeples too. Upgraded to an 7, I have never turned this one down, it has done very will in mixed groups (gamers and non-gamers).

TRY July/04: Good, quick game!  I played both the Jamaica (secret hands) and Tortuga (faceup hands & draws) versions online at youplay.it, and enjoyed each.  Thinking about buying, as I believe that even my kids could catch on and enjoy this!  Added to BSW Dec/04; most people play Tortuga there.  I prefer the youplay.it implementation, but it isn't live gaming.

I want to like it, I want the family to like it, I should like it, and when we play it the games are moderately enjoyable.  However, something's missing from the fun-factor, and I hardly ever _want_ to play it.  Notes on the game itself:  nice theme, nice bits, and what seem like good mechanics; there is just something about the whole package that leaves me somewhat disinterested.

Ez volt a játék, ami miatt társasjáték rajongó lettem. Taktikázós játékmenet, nagyon eltalált mechanizmussal. Szerencse szerepe csak a felhúzott kártyákban nyilvánul meg, de ez hanyagolható. Még csak 2 és 3 fővel játszottunk. Minél többen vagyunk, annál többet kell agyalni. 5 fővel már kaotikus is lehet.

A simple abstract racing game with a pirate theme.  A favorite of mine for it's speed and simplicity, but still some room for clever play.  The release of Cartagena 2 really improved the rules.  You can play this version with those rules no problem, so I would recommend it.  Except leave the boat at the end.

RATING: 8
This is an easy to learn, little down time, fun but with deep strategies game. Just need to 5 mins to explain and then the game can go smoothly. There are 2 modes of gameplay. One is hiding your hand cards while another is showing your cards to public (less luck) which I think maybe to tense for casual players. The map of the game will be different for every game since it is built by players randomly, it has a lot of replay value. A good filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I play this mostly w/the kids, who love it, and are (slowly) catching on.  The strategy is a little counter-intuitive at first, which rewards the first to "figure it out."  But it's always a tense nail-biter.

The Jamaica versions seems the way to go for me. With the Tortuga, the lack of luck might turn the game into a total brain burn. I will try it out and that may modify the score, as some of those types of games I like (e.g. Torres).

RATING: 10
Unsurpassed in its category (light/medium weight race games), this highly underrated game is a master-class in game design. Its minimalist set of just 3 rules distils all game-balancing mechanisms to their barest dichotomy: spend resources to get closer to your goal, and get further away from the goal to replenish resources! The game is also malleable: one can easily shorten the duration or give a handicap to a weaker player. Cartagena plays equally well (but very differently!) with 2 or 5 players, with non-trivial strategical and tactical options (and a bit of luck to throw in more excitement).

Easy candy land type game. Some choices in what to play if you have the cards for it. You might be able to hop from start to finish if you have the right cards. Slightly more strategic than candyland. Played fast enough I suppose. A game I would play again but not itching to do so.

RATING: 7
Like Hare &amp; Tortoise in play, with decisions of when to go forward without overstretching your card resources, otherwise you&#039;ll have to go backwards to increase your hand options. This is an improvement on H&amp;T in firstly the board setup differs each game so evaluation isn&#039;t repetitive, and card draws randomise things allowing players of different abilities to enjoy the race. Best with 3 to 4 players to allow some of the dramatic leapfrogging, but I find with 3 actions each player has is one action too many, especially if card(s)are drawn intially or during a players turn, which leads to evaluation. This is a shame as determining player status is visual, which I like in a game. However I tend to find that once you are behind and you see gaps appear in the corridors, you start to lose hope which unfortunately isn&#039;t short lived in this game.

RATING: N/A
A pretty clever race game, honestly. You're trying to get 6 pirate meeples from one side of a tunnel to the other as they attempt to escape from prison. You play a card showing one icon from your hand and move any of your pieces to an available space also showing that icon. That's how you move forward. To gain more cards into your hand, you have to move a piece backwards to a space that contains other meeples, and you draw 1 or 2 cards depending on how many pirates are already there. So it's this almost tidal-like movement, back and forth. 

Certainly not the deepest game out there, but it's simple, works with both children and adults, comes in a small box (or my edition does; looks like it's been embiggened in the last few years), and plays in 30 minutes or so. I doubt I ever get rid of this.

variant: 1st player only takes 2 actions. this avoids making them set the other players up. also, use hidden hands but open draw pile. this mix is far better than either version- avoids the luck of Jamaica and AP of Tortuga. its an 8 when playing this way.

A fun game that starts out looking simple, then people see the depth, then it becomes simple again.  I've only played the "Jamaica" (closed hands) version though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dreadful in 'blind' mode (cards drawn at random, hands concealed), quite interestingly strategic in 'expert' mode (sets of 12 cards-to-be-drawn revealed, hands displayed). But not really very replayable after a point; there isn't much fine strategy refinement to be done, and no interesting twists to be found. Important note: this is just a terrible game with 5 players, and strategically interesting with 2 or 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played it once and did not like. I feel that even in the 'skill' game there is too much luck and randomness involved. Yes, in theory you might want to look out for what everyone else has when it comes to cards and which cards are available to draw but that is no 'fun' and feels like work and so everyone just tries to make the most of his cards and positions and let's see what happens. Not a bad idea, just too light for my taste.

This game has been described to me as Candyland for adults. I can see the comparison, but I don't think it does the game justice.

This was a very enjoyable filler game. Playing cards to move forward, but having to move back to refill your hand is a great push/pull. Using large jumps can end up giving your opponent even larger jumps. An adult chutes and ladders is an interesting comparison for this game.

PROS: visually interesting, simple choices, quick turns, feels like running a maze, balanced short-term vs long-term strategy, no text dependency, pirates!
CONS: players can feel hopelessly behind, new or very unlucky players might even get "stuck"

OMSCHRIJVING: Licht tactisch ontsnappingsspel.
In 1672 vond er een legendarische uitbraak van piraten uit de gevangenissen van de forten van Cartagena plaats. De spelers proberen als eerste hun piraten door de tunnels te laten ontsnappen.

Match the symbol on your card to the symbol on the game board to move your pawns through, but with the twist being that you have to move your pawns backward to pick up additional cards. The playing time may be a bit too long for such a feathery, lightweight game.

One of my favorite racing games.  A very interesting concept.  You can only go forward by going backward.

Got in 2007

Strategy - Try to have all your men on the board as soon as possible.  In the beginning constantly move your men forward then fall your men back to gain cards.  Be advantageous and move your men forward by the biggest jumps possible.

2007 Plays = 2
2008 Plays = 1

--Sept2008-- I'd seen it played before, but had never tried myself.  It's got quite a lot of that _Transamerica_ feel:  one attempts to encourage the other players to your work for you.  Yet here it seems there's a bit more of a (inadvertent?) Kingmaker element:  if one plays poorly, the next player could be momentarily advantaged.  I expect I'll be happy to play again, but won't likely pick up a copy.

Small family game in which you have to move forward and also backwards to get all your six escaped prisoners to the waiting sloop.

There are two ways to play.  One:  Random draw of cards.  Two:  12 cards are layed out and chosen from.  We like the second way much better.  Also reading the rules and knowing there is the option to take up to 3 actions completely changes how I feel about this game.  goes from a 7 to a 7.5.

The mechanics of this one are definitely different than most games I've played.

Simple, yet very satisfying abstract chase game. Open card variant allows plenty of potential for brain-burning AP, should you go in for that kind of thing. 

Picked this up in a sale at Forbidden Planet for £2.99. Nice!

Edit : (after about 9 months) Remains a big favourite for me and the missus. Still one of the most satisfying games for 2 players in our collection. Doesn't quite seem to have the same fun factor as other acquisitions (Portobello Market, Downfall of Pompeii) when broken out as a 'gateway' game, but still a reliable choice. 

Also, I often manage to beat my wife, which is becoming a rarity of anything we play. Double plus.

RATING: 7.5
This was on sale, so when I have a reason to buy a game from a place, I also throw in another game (or two, if the original game is high priced). Ya know, just the stupid things I do to rationalize my madness. At this writing, I have 180 games in my collection. Well, 182 now. I bought this and Silent War from Boulder Games. Now my girlfriend thinks I have too many games, and we came up with a rule, which was as long as it fits on the shelving unit in the basement I can have as many as I want. I'm pretty crafty and years of Tetris-playing have made me adept at getting all my games to fit, so that rule doesn't prevent me from getting more. What prevents me is the dirty glare and biting comments from my (non-gamer, closet nerd really, but don't tell her I said that) girlfriend. So I ordered these games, thinking ok I'll just get them and take the pain. The Cartagena purchase is more for her anyway, MAAAYBE she'll like it, so I'll get these games but just show her Cartagena and try to spin it that way. But then I lucked out! She's out of the house on errands when UPS comes a-ringing. It's my games! I rush to open the box, take out the envelope with the packing slip and packets of candy that Boulder Games throws in there as a treat. Gotta love that. Anyhow, I bring the box and games downstairs, toss the box out in the garage, and look for space for my games on the shelves. Cartagena fits immediately, no problem, but Silent War, that's a nice chunky box, I'm going to have to rearrange some boxes. But I can do it! I know there's room in there, so there I am moving games around when I hear the door and see the girlfriend walk in. "What are you doing over there?" she inquires, probably with one eyebrow lowered accusingly, but I can't be sure because another free-standing shelving unit blocks our view of each other."Oh, just cleaning up," I say, not entirely lying but hey, it's for the games, so I'm comfortable with a little equivocating. She goes upstairs, I find an empty spot that I completely missed, saving me the trouble of restacking lots of boxes to create my own personal version of geometric peace and harmony. Up I go, some quick chatting about her errands and her day, and then ok, I gotta go back upstairs, see you later. I work from home upstairs, so nothing fishy about skidaddling upstairs, although why I was cleaning up during a weekday is darn suspicious. Moments later she calls up. "You are SO busted." "What do you mean?" I inquire as sheepishly as I can muster. She comes up stairs waving the envelope at me. Dammit! Caught! There's always a loose end! This is why I don't commit horrible crimes because I know I'd miss something and get caught. Well, that and plus it's wrong to commit horrible crimes. But here's the kicker, for a moment, I was almost saved even from the envelope blunder. When she saw the envelope she was confused and thought it was hers, so she opened it and saw the candy. And for a brief moment she thought, aw, he got me some candy ... just a brief moment. The candy ALMOST saved me. But she then looked at the packing slip and the cat was out of the bag. So, thanks to Boulder Games for the candy. It almost got me out of deep doodoo for buying too many games, which is a wonderful thing to say about any board game retailer.

A brilliant little game of timing.  For some reason I seem to do well at this, despite it being all about spatial awareness (seeing where the symbols are best arranged.)  Perfect family game as there is the potential to make moves to help other players without overtly doing so.  Drawing from the open card pool leads to horrific AP and overly benefits the card counters which is a shame because the random draw is too random.  There ought to be some sort of compromise possible.

Played the Tortuga variant once with 4P. Cartagena gives a nostalgic Pachisi-like feel of getting your playing pieces home, only this time there are some tactical decisions to be made. Players play cards from their hands and move to the next empty spot which has the symbol featured on the card. The trick is, the only way to draw more cards is to move pieces backwards to the next occupied space. 

Cartagena is somewhat replaced by Atlantis, which is a more complex version of it and also designed by the same person. However, Cartagena is a lot less mathy and has a far simpler setup, so I wouldn't turn a game of this down either.

Az Atlantist azért szidják, mert egyértelműen a Cartagena másolatának tartják. Jogos, tényleg a főmechanizmusuk ugyanaz. De éppen az apró eltérések miatt szerintem sokkal élvezhetőbb az Atlantis, nem beszélve arról, hogy szebb. Az ős Cartagena sokkal számolósabb, nagyobb AP veszélye van véleményem szerint és nehezebb is. A szerencse szerepét is nagyobbnak érzem, mert kevesebb lapból kell gazdálkodni benne. Nekem kevésbé jött be.

Only played Jamaica, not Tortuga.----I used to have this and traded it away.  Though I like the game, it seems that any time that it was time to break out a game, I never said "Hey! Let's play Cartagena!".  But, that doesn't mean it's a bad game, it just means that I wanted to play other games instead.

Light-hearted with some interesting depth to it. You can stumble along, making random, quick decisions and either win or lose. You can, on the other hand, give this a degree of serious thought and work out some "winning ways." "Jamaika" version, in which opponents do not see each other's cards or the cards available for pickup, is . . different. Don't like it much. Knowing what opponents have is a component of the basic game's strategy. Removing that knowledge gives the game a blind alley randomness that detracts, IMHO. Quick game; nice "eye-opener" for gatherings.

This is a nice little game. The rules are extremely simple, you either play a card and move forward or move back and take a card or two but within these options you end up with a lot of interesting decisions about who to move back and which cards to play to move which pirates forward. It can be taught really easily but it stays interesting right up to the end.

Candyland meets Hare and Tortoise?  I like light games, but this felt a little too insubstantial for me.  Even though it is clearly better in the advanced mode, I think I prefer the basic version.  The game just doesn't strike me as meaty enough to merit the analysis brought on by exposed holdings.

Simple race game, but with a nice, clever twist in that you have to move back to get more cards and go forward. The other cool aspect is that once you've advanced, you cover that symbol, so it makes it easier for your opponent to advance even farther.

I like the creative rules, where there are two different ways to play.  Both are fun and I'd like to play some more and get deeper into the game.  I also like that it's fairly simple to learn no matter which way you play yet still offers quite a bit of depth.

Crafty little game which plays you as much as you play it. It's pretty good at making you feel like you made a devious plan, while you actually probably lucked out for the most part. Suffers from a first player advantage issue. Still, its quick, fun, tensed and can be played with non-gamers. Just don't play the Tortuga version, which really only adds AP and doubles playtime.

This is holding up brilliantly with years of play.  Cartagena is not the most complex or brain-burning game on the shelf, but what is there is just exactly right.  The decisions aren't terribly difficult, but each one is pivotal.  Easy to teach, fun to play, clever if you win.  PS:  I try not to care too much about the way a game looks, but why oh why did they get rid of the dignified, tasteful box cover art in favor of the badly drawn coloring-book pirates on the new edition???

A rather simple game but I still really like it.  It seems like another player always manages to beat me at the last second when I think I've got the game won.  This is frustrating, but I always feel like I want to play again to try and win, so it must be a pretty good game.  Good for non-gamers too.

Candyland for grownups, but there's not too much here.  I think one of the variants allowing you to see the cards coming up would make the game more interesting, but possibly make it too long/involved for what I want it to be--light filler.

This was a real surprise. Though the objective is to be the first to move your 6 pirates forward to the boat, it includes an inspirational mechanism that requires you to move backwards to replenish your cards.

RATING: 7
No, it's not a Pirate's Candyland. In the Tortuga variant, this is a sleek and elegantly designed brain burner that plays fine with any number of players. The other official variant makes the game more dependent on luck, so this game can be used as a gateway to more strategic gaming. (It worked on my wife, who at first refused to play this game with me Tortuga style. Now she even prefers it that way.) Simple rules and a estimated playing time that is independent of the number of players make this game a good filler.

For an 'old' game, holds up surprisingly well! 

Fine light card-game. Played with a week ago with my 5 year old son and he got the basics down easily. To play optimally, AP could become a problem, but it is enjoyable to what it offers: light family gaming that doesn't take too long.

Perfect introduction game to take people away from the everlasting Scrabble/Rummikub/card games into more 'sophisticated' gaming.

My kid lost interest on it though, and as I have much more games to play, traded it away.

It works as something a little longer than filler. I think 20-30 min for 3 players, might be longer with more.  I think the game suffers with more players; the last game we played with three and that was fun. I've played with more than that and didnt like the chaos at all.  I cant help but feel there is something more that could have been done with what is basically a good set of mechanics/rules. As usual Colovini finds interesting mechanics, I just wish they'd work these games up into something deeper. 2.23.14 Played again raised from 6 to 7;  1.12.18 and really appreciated the movement system, its based on Candy Land or something even older but the fall back to get cards is a brilliant innovation.

Play a card, move one of your pirates to the next available space with the same icon. Easy enough. Be the first to get all 6 your pirates on the boat at the end of the track. Easy enough (to understand). The trick is what cards to you play when, and when do you move back to gain more cards?
It's a fun, light game with lots of tactical moves. It doesn't outstay it's welcome. It's good at what it sets out to do.

The first time that I it saw, I thought that it was a bad enough game. Fat mistake, already I will not judge a game if I have not played it before.

It is a great game, is the best game that you can propose for not players. Now then, with the two versions, undoubtedly, it will be enough to keep satisfied the experienced and not experienced players.

I recommend it, undoubtedly, it is the best introduction to the games of "German" type.

#----0----#

La primera vez que lo vi, pensé que era un juego bastante malo. Craso error, ya no juzgaré un juego si no lo he jugado antes.

Es un gran juego, es el mejor juego que puedes proponer para los no jugadores. Ahora bien, con sus dos versiones, sin duda, será sufuciente para mantener contentos a los jugadores experimentados y no experimentados.

Lo recomiendo, sin duda, es la mejor introducción a los juegos de tipo "Alemán".

RATING: 8
Really clever, quick game with a lot of strategy. It proves to be much deeper than it lets on at first, with a lot of interesting decisions. Two rule elements make this game: when you play a card, you go to the first EMPTY space; and, of course, the mechanics of how to replenish your hand. You have to decide how quickly you can afford to move forward not only because your hand is forever depleting, but also because each move forward you make gives your opponent a possible advantage. Cartagena is incredibly easy to understand, even for non-gamers and plays just as well with two people as five. Fantastic gem! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This clever little game could have been themed just about anything - I certainly don't feel like it evokes a pirate jailbreak when I play. But even as a pure abstract, the mechanics are fairly original and very streamlined and the play moves quickly. Those hoping for a flavorful pirate game will be greatly disappointed, but anyone who appreciates a clean, original design and fast, entertaining gameplay will enjoy this one.

Someone described this as Candyland for adults.  Not a very flattering comparison, as I think there's a great mixture of tactics and strategy here.  More players make it interesting... definitely more chaos, but more changes to benefit from other player's mistakes.  Maybe this is a flaw, but so far it's worked.

This is yet another interesting Colovini game.  The first of his that I tried was Clans, and I was struck by how odd it was, and how different it was than most other eurogames.  Cartagena managed to do the same thing, although with a completely different game.  Both are relatively quick and simple to learn, but Cartagena is a race game where you have to go backwards more often than not in order to gain the ability to go forwards.  Timing your jumps is key and using your opponents as well.

I can explain the rules of this game in 1 sentence: On your turn you can do any combination of the following twice: play a card and move a pirate to that next open space with that symbol, or move a pirate backwards to the next space with less than 3 pirates and draw cards equal to the number of pirates there. Extremely simple rules, but the strategy is pretty decent actually. I was hoping that this would be one that Ollie understands the strategy, it is a little tricky for him to make optimal plays, but he does fine.

RATING: 7
Good filler which is very quick to set up, explain and play. Plays great with two or three players. In addition, the components and artwork of the 1st edition are quite charming. Still have to encounter the person who does not like it after his/her first play. Some randomness, but intelligent play is most certainly rewarded (especially with the more interesting Tortuga ruleset). I do get the feeling that it is hard(er) to win if you are the starting player, but that it easily corrected by only taking a single action as the starting player.

12/2008:7
The 7 rating reflects feelings toward this game. I like it, but not love it. I have to say, the game is surprisingly fun for such a light-weight mechanic. I am not sure how well this game will hold up after repeated plays, but at least for the first couple of times, it was fun.

A series of cards that one hordes will lead to better placement and victory. That's true with 4-5 players. I find it interesting that one can play under the radar and come up strong toward the end of the game. Excellent game for an evening closer.

Replayed this game with 5. Quite easy to teach and fun. Realized immediately the consequences of not moving your entire group together. Could be pretty darn devastating especially if all your men are on board and you have one person left on the board in last place.

Cartagena is a very tight game.  One of the keys to this game for me is how you have to play off your opponent's moves.  You have to balance waiting for an opportunity and avoiding giving other players similar opportunities.  In my opinion, the game has an elegance that makes it mentally attractive.

Help your pirate team escape from prison. On the surface appears to be a fairly mundane race game with a candyland movement mechanism - but it turns out that a fairly strategic game lies underneath the surface. Easy to learn, brings about interesting decisions, and has a relatively quick play time - a good choice as a gateway title. The variable starting board is also a nice touch. All this in a relatively small box.

Delightful strategy game (3-5 players)with a unique, clever mechanic, fast and short but a lot of thinking involved. But version 2 has everything version 1 has plus more, so you can play with the rules of this original version if you just buy version 2, "The Pirate's Nest".

We play this more often than it's logged--you don't really have a score, so the results tend to get lost in post-game-weekend shuffle.

This game is such a hit for me and my now 8-year-old.  And not just one and done fun, but we keep coming back to it.  Usually, if I can get in a couple of plays of a game and enjoy myself, I call it a win.  I'm easy that way.  This game has surpassed those expectations in a big way.  Keeper for my family.   Since it's not a highly rated game and yet gone over so well... makes me wonder what else is out there that I'm missing out on.

Quite nice little game, but total lack of interaction and pasted-up theme lowers the experience for me. During the latest game, approximately 10 sentences were said while every player was staring at the board and their cards. Harmless game with nice idea, but not a special case. I have played three times and I have no hurry to play again.

Six months later the fourth and fifth game, what can I add? The game is dry. It is necessary to have skill in order to win, but the luck element with cards is also strong. Not my favorite game. 6th play, nothing new.

Отличное сочетание тактик, блефа, рандома и расчета. Отличные компоненты, обоснованный формат. Также есть почва для введения мелких домашних правил.

RATING: 6
What makes this game stand out, I think, is the way that you have to essentially hurt your position to draw cards.  The game isn't taxing, or even strategic (it's strictly a tactical game), but it is unique.

JAMAICA: I haven't played the game with the Tortuga variant, but I'm not sure that I would want to, since this is a light game that can be played to pass the time during social gatherings.  Having face-up cards would lead to analysis paralysis, making the game longer and too "gamer" for the kinds of people who would typically play this game.  That being said, I wouldn't be opposed to playing the Tortuga variant with more hardcore gamers, just to see how much of a difference it makes.

Revolves around an interesting mechanic of movement which is based on symbols on the game board and cards with matching symbols and the idea of travelling also backwards. There's not much more to the game and often times a "best move" is clearly identifiable. A nice filler or starter which provides a few intriguing moments with well placed cards and foiling opponents' plans.

RATING: 6
Short-term loss for long-term gain.  Great mechanic.

However, Cartagena has three major problems:

1) There is no hand limit, which means that players can stockpile an arbitrarily high number of cards.

2) When a single symbol is completely covered, pawns can move the entire length of the track with a single card.

Note that #1 and #2 together support the annoying strategy whereby players can hoard a mountain of cards, wait for a particular symbol to be completely covered, and then sprint to the end of the track for the win.

3) Players (new players, especially) can be stuck in an endless non-progressing loop if their pawns lag too far behind.

Since Cartagena 2 (the sequel) fixes all three problems, this one goes in the trade pile.

This game is deeper than it looks on the surface.  There is a very subtle strategy here that is appealing to all who have played - help me and help others.  It becomes an optimization of which act does not help others too much.

We play with all information closed as my wife is prone to analysis paralysis.  Having everything open would only make the game longer.  It is an extremely enjoyable game.

7.5 after 1 play.

Theme is pasted on, but rather interactive game. Rules are simple but thought is required for each move and observation of the cards of your opoonents is important.

Simple, and interesting. Good short game. Would probably play others more often, but if you're short on time, this isn't bad.

A simple, light game... a favorite with my nieces and nephews. Colorful, easy to play, but with enough strategy to keep adults interested.

I really didn't care for this game at first, but it is starting to grow on me.  Definitely a better experience with more players, but it still isn't one of my preferred titles.

Another racing style game. Not a big fan of racing games. This one brings nothing new to the table. Can't recommend

RATING: 5
The heavy reliance on good card draws overshadows an otherwise quick and streamlined filler.  The mechanic of advancing your pieces, as well as moving them back to let you refill your hand is clever.  However, the whole thing just didn't seem very fun to play.

I grok this game well.  Haven't gotten daring enough to try the Tortuga version.  Give me time...

Simple rules, yet varying degrees of strategy depending on which variant you choose to play.  Tough choices, shorter length and flexibility with the layout make this a winner to me.

I would probably give this a better rating if I could win more often.  A fun game.  I prefer the cards hidden version.

I have a weak spot for most things pirate related, no matter how thin the "piratemness" may be. But this one is essentially a decent, simple, race-to-the-end game that can be tailored for more strategy and less luck or vice versa, depending on the audience and mood.

Nice little game : short and accessible to all. I think it is a good gateway game.

Jó kis filler, látom benne a fantáziát. Feleséggel is bepróbáltatom vmikor, szeretjük ezeket a két fővel is élvezetes, egyszerűnek tűnő, de azért minimális agyalásra késztető játékokat. Ráadásul hamar lemegy egy játék és másnak is két mondatban megtanítható.

After 1 Play: I played the version with face up cards.  I'd like to try the normal game, as I think I'd actually like it more with a little more luck thrown in.

After 2+ Plays: I stand corrected, as I am convinced the face-up version is better.  Either way the game is pleasant enough, but not something I'm probably ever going to request.

A very good filler game. Suffers from a bit of chaos and luck with four players, but the key is not to plan a master strategy 3 turns in advance. Rather, have a few ideas that can be carried out short-term, and always have contigencies in place, and this game will be enjoyable.

A simple and fun game. Easy to teach and everybody seems to like it. A suitable game to play with non-gamers.

Simple and clever mechanic, but I don't like the pasted on theme. Cards are small, thin and awful. I expected much bigger bits and board and of higher quality. Doesn't worth the price I paid for.

Обязательно нужно играть по правилам "Тортуга" для взрослых. Тогда это прекрасная абстрактная блиц-стратегия от 2-х до 6-и игроков.

Also among my favorites.  Not to be sexist but for some reason this game seems to favor newbie females over newbie males.  Like Ticket to Ride  I think it is just better oriented to how females think.  Anyway it is fun.

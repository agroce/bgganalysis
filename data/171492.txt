A great filler with the usual delightful art of Michael Menzel (gotta love the country bumpkin on the box cover, trying to look fashionable) ! The dice mechanic ensures that no two games of Vienna will be alike.

RATING: 5
It's nice, but it doesn't do anything that other games haven't done better.  Can also be over really quickly if someone gets lucky with their dice rolls.

RATING: 7
Rated an 7 because it's so quick. If it was longer than 20-30 mins I would have rated it a 6. It feels like a faster and leaner Kingsburg, a nice dice allocation filler to start the evening with. There's an obvious strategy to win which is hard to stop someone enacting with 3 players but the game balances out with 4 and 5 players.

They missed a trick with the double sided board as both sides have the same layout only differing artwork. They could have had a second variant on the second side of the board.

More streamlined version of kingsburg. I prefer this game over kingsburg and alien frontiers, both are showing their age. Compairing this to voyages of marco polo this game is more of a filler. Marco polo is better do to its modular nature. Vienna has the same game weight as splendor. A feature of the game is that its light on the engine building and teachtree that makes the dice workerplacement tight and tense.

This game is pretty boring. The dice placement is a decent concept but after two plays you find yourself always choosing the same 3-5 spots to put them. It is too light for me. Would only play it with children. Otherwise it will stay on the shelf and collect dust.

Unoriginal in its mechanisms, the theme does not work at all with the game, and there seems to be a dominant strategy that players have to guard against (double placement: purchasing card plus scoring). Feels unfinished..

Nothing really new here. Solid design. Some real choices. As often in Schmidt games from this line, the game is in fact good, albeit somewhat bland. Seems balanced. Too bad that the double sided board arbours only cosmetic differences. I would have rated it 7 if I played it 5 years back...

#DiceRolling #SetCollecting

Not very entertaining dice rolling game where you try to collect cards and build a majority of symbols on it. I think there is only one strategy. Get cards and score. But if you don't roll a combination to make a 6 or to score, you have lost.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Reminds a bit of Kingsburg but is a much faster game as it can easily be played in 30 minutes if everyone knows the game. It is a race to 25 points although whomever has the most points at the end of that round actually wins. Dice must be placed (up to 2 per space of your own dice) to take certain actions that grant money, special cards, or points in some fashion). Harmless but not that exciting. Feels quite a bit like JASE.

Light but very fun family worker/dice placement game. With 3p we play it with a variant because a 25-points game is just too short. So when someone hits 25 points the game will last two more rounds and then ends. Just gives more possibilities for strategy this way.

A decent light euro dice game that almost feels like a stripped down Kingsburg. It plays quickly (30 mins.) and cleanly. It's not the most exciting game, but it's easy to teach and if anything it ends too quickly. One or two bad rolls can really ruin you.

RATING: 7
Very simply a streamlined, winnowed, and possibly abruptly truncated version of Kingsburg. I might prefer it to Kingsburg as the whole buildings aspect of the latter feels burdensome rather than integral. On the other hand, Vienna skews light and feels a tad lacking dynamics-wise.

Vienna is a light dice worker placement game with end-of-round execution and a set execution order, like Caylus.  On a player's turn, he rolls his dice and plays one or two of them on an action space whose number matches the sum of the placed dice.  Players are penalized one money for placing behind their furthest die on the execution path (and money is tight).  There are a couple ways to collect points, the most prominent of which is to buy cards that provide varying amounts of three symbols.  If the player chooses an action spot to activate a certain symbol, he compares his total with his left and right neighbor and gets the appropriate amount of points and/or money.  There are a few other spots on the board that provide points, often by spending money or using high-valued dice.  Money can also be used to manipulate dice, either by adding/subtracting a pip or allowing a re-roll.  The game ends when someone hits 25 points; whoever has the most points at the end is the winner.  While it doesn't provide anything new or exciting, Vienna feels like a very polished game that executes the dice placement mechanic very smoothly.  In a world where "dice filler" usually means "yahtzee variant", this is a refreshing change-up.

it´s a fast dice placement game with some interesting choices during the game play
update: a kind of mechanical game play - i miss little bit the emotions
too bad, that the backside of the plan is only vienna by night!
i had the hope, that they change some effects
for example 
a field to get three coins or to pay three coins for drawing a person randomly or
a field to reroll any own dice AND to force each opponent to reroll one dice

It's a blast ... to put the things back into the box and turn towards something which hopefully is a little bit more exciting. I must say I've played far better games with a tacked on theme than this one. This one really reminds me of Kingsburg - without its most interesting feature: the advances. Add the curvy Caylus road (just the looks) and here's a Vienna which is a bit more bland than one could hope for.

RATING: 7
The core mechanic of the game is that there is a path through Vienna, where every spot is an action space. You place dice on action spaces to take the actions, but you have to match the number on that space. The pip values required increase the further along you go, but so do the "coolness" of those spots. Generally you must place further along the road than any of your previous dice placements, but paying a buck lets you break that rule.

One of the main things you do in the game is hire people who come with one of three? four? types of symbols on them. Some of the other spots on the board let you trigger a scoring for those symbols where you compare your symbols to your neighbors and get points for having the same or more symbols.

There are also spots on the board where you just outright get points or can buy points for coins. And there are spots that let you take control of special bonus cards that give you extra abilities.

The game often forces you into positions where you don't have the dice you need, so you're forced to make the best of what you're given. And when other players can take the same spots you need you're forced to make some hard choices about what is important. I enjoyed the game.

"# This means nothing to me..."  Vienna is a light Kingsburg like dice placement game that hasn't got enough meat on its bones; no staying power and is too quick to mean anything.  Probably good for fillers, or kids; but its not for me.

Pörgős, szórakoztató, de nagyon lapfüggő! Szélsőségesen sima győzelmek is lehetnek, túl erősek a lapok, nem érzem kiegyensúlyozott játéknak. A lapok kb. fele játékba sem került egyik alkalommal sem (3 játék után), ez eleve hatalmas szerencsefaktort hordoz magában. Ha egyik félnek az átlagosnál kicsivel jobb lapok jönnek, a másiknak pedig kicsivel rosszabbak, akkor esélytelen a dolog szerintem. Van két klasszikus lap, amin eldőlnek a partik: az egyik félnek, ami az emberek közül dobat el, a másiknak, ami az atom-os jelzőkből dobat el. Ha az egyik félnek jön ez a fajta lap, a másiknak nem, akkor gyorsan K.O.

Ezzel együtt szívesen játszom vele máskor is. Jól visszaadja a film hangulatát! Jó!

Nem vagyok a film(trilógia) hódolója, ennek ellenére a játék minden pillanatát élveztem.
Többet kell vele játszani, de első alkalommal is nagyon megfogott. A két oldal teljesen egyensúlyban levőnek tűnik - szóval csak dicsérni tudom.

Sajnos a szabály sok esetben nem egyértelműen fogalmaz, ezért játék előtt tisztázni szükséges néhány dolgot!

Best.Theme.Ever - the game does a fantastic job of making you feel the tension of the film, the card titles are great (but not for the kiddies), it's fast and fun to play

So why only a 6?  There is not much strategy or variety of play, and the balance seems a bit off.  I think an experienced Alien player will win at least 70% of games.  

But if you love the movie, you need this game!  Worth every penny of the $21 I paid to Artscow.

Wow.  Could be the coolest game I've got, possibly ever, and it was fan created.

The theme is perfectly executed from the quotes and movie-stills to the game play integration.

Oh, and the card game behind the theme is pretty good too.

I probably give the card-game an 8, but then with the perfectly integrated theme, and the theme being probably the best action movie ever made, the rating is bumped up to a 10.

UPDATE: Okay, I can't bump this past a 10, but I can say that I bump the card-game before the theme up to a 9.  We've played many games now and regardless of who wins, it always comes down to the end and there is almost always a chance for a comeback.  It is a very fun game to play.

This is a quick and light filler card game.  I enjoyed Aliens the film and like the theme.

It is procedurally similar all the way through meaning that there is a real danger of overplaying.  It would be a shame, it is pitched just right at the moment.

We became aware of couple of problem areas in the rules but nothing that could not be ruled on or felt like it was critical to the outcome of the game.

The card art was clear but seperating out the alien and marine deck required a little thought on the version we played. 

I would like to credit Tom for making such a good job of constructing this print & play game the quality of the components was first class,

Sharing a great graphic design and an interesting game
play which oozes with theme. Anybody that loves
"Aliens" owes it to themselves to re-live the movie in this intense little game both as an alien player and later as the marine player and compare results. Remember to quote the movie lines in character. Role playing is essential to your enjoyment.

RATING: 9.5
The game's mechanics are simple and the game plays good. The theme is there and it really feels like a war.

The mechanism with "Nuke the entire site from orbit" seems to be a stretch within the theme but it doesn't ruin the game.

The game plays the best for the first time (when players have no idea what awaits them in the opponent's deck) but it becomes more strategical to know what shenanigans your opponent can hold in sleeve after a couple of plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

An excellent, fast-paced game. It is exciting as players have to pay for more powerful cards by discarding other cards and deciding who is expendable and who is not. Great game, I highly recommend it.

Must have for fans of the film because the mechanics and gameplay mirror very closely the thematic events of the movie. It's a fun game in its own right, but when you can appreciate the quotes on the cards and the timing of each Marine's death, it draws you in that much more. Can get tense towards the end.

RATING: N/A
[b][FirstPlay4thMay2012][/b] This is a really good two-player asymmetrical game. It's very thematic, simple and very true to the movie which the game is based on. The flavor text and the screen-cap on each card really capture the feel of the movie.

This game takes about 30-40 minutes, and is very simple to play. One player will play as the marine and the other player plays the alien. Right of the bat, you'll see how unbalanced the game is, favoring mostly the alien player. Truth is, the marine actually has equal chance of winning as aliens are easily killed. 

One of the unique and cool thing about the game is how the marine player has 15 cards laid in front of them, showing the squad they start with. Each time the marine plays takes a damage, he needs to kill one of his squad member, in sequence of rank. This provides a very cool play where you get to see one-by-one, the marine is killed, just like in the movie.

Another cool thing about the game is how the marine player moves from one location to another, exactly like in the movie. The marine has to battle with the alien horde at every stop, until they reach the last stop.

I've played this game many times, and honestly, majority of the games often ended with a very dramatic and eventful battle. Seriously, it's glorious and like the movie, it's epic.

Good game Mark! I absolutely LOVE this game! It's simple, thematic, quick and really fun to play.

Captures the flair of the movie. Supreme game. Wanted to test it and we played it for nearly 4 Hours. At the End 3:3. Very balanced, although some cards seemed overpowerd at first sight. Love it...(ordered all games from this brilliant mind :-) and hope his first commercial game will be a success)

RATING: 7
Nice little game but can suffer from the alien player running out of aliens. A quick house rule that they draw two per turn usually fixes this.

The aliens are looking to inflict maximum damage on the marines with clever placement of aliens and ambushes. 
The marines are just looking to get the hell out of there. The different play styles make both decks feel very different and there is a lot of re playability here, especially in the alien deck.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent self-published CCG based on the James Cameron film ALIENS.  Fast, quick, fun, with a high casualty rate and an "always on the verge" sense of urgency.  

Nifty mechanics included fixed number of turns (16-19 or so) which can be sped up or slowed down by cardplay.  Also the idea of movement through five different "battlefields" representing locations from the movie, as the Marines try to escape back to the Sulacco alive.

Each deck is tight and well-balanced with cards that seem to be useful early or late in the game.  No cards seem too powerful or "broken."   There is some card-combo strategy and planning to do, but the game moves too swiftly for that to be a huge advantage to the professional Dominion or Magic CCG'ers.

The artwork comprises of stills/screencaps from the actual film accompanied with chrome and quotes, which really get you into the spirit of the game. NOTE that some feature NSFW/R-rated language (as the designer himself reminds us).  

The game nails the essence of the movie in the best ways, making it a must-own for fans of the film, even non-gamers or non-CCG'ers.  It's light but not lightweight, so a perfect filler or closer.  I imagine if you have the movie or soundtrack on while you play, makes for an even more atmospheric diversion.

Introduced the game to my buddy. He is the same age as me and, like any guy in our age group, loved the film.

We ended up playing 6 games.
Mark's effort to capture the pace, feel, and narrative of the Aliens film is impeccable and top-notch. A fine effort. If you love the Aliens film, get this game in your collection. It's amazingly well-designed and a hell of a lot of fun!  You'd be spewing quotes from the film as you battle it out. Xeno player? He or she will need to make screeching sounds as their acid blood splatters about.

(02/13/2014) Comment based on two initial plays.

This is a fun little card game that plays quick, and invokes the feeling of the movie [i]Aliens[/i]. It's not too far removed from a card game of [i]War[/i] in terms of its simplicity, but it is amusing as there is some strategy. Each turn, each player will be faced with discarding cards, because of various "take that" play from the opponent. You want to keep ALL of your cards, but must choose carefully. As the colonial marines, you must keep the four or so main characters alive to get to the [i]Sulaco[/i], battling through a sequential series of rooms or actions, just like in the movie. As the aliens, you are trying to overwhelm the marines and kill all of them, before they are able to "nuke" from orbit or get their characters out alive.

If you are a fan of the movie, you will most likely enjoy this. There's nothing like the feel of blowing away a whole stack of aliens, or feeding Burke to them. Plays in 30 minutes or less, so it is easy to switch sides and see if you can do better as the aliens/marines. Rating: solid "8".

One of the most immersive adaptation of a movie I've ever played. While there's a plenty of possibilities for both sides, the game follows the plot surprisingly close ([i]although poor Hicks had never made it to the Sulaco yet[/i]). Under the heavy thematic skin, there's fine engine of hand management and timing- a thoroughly satisfying experience.

From the movie stills and character lines on the cards, to the other little touches, like the fact that you can't use the M40 grenade card while in the reactor battlefield (because Gorman ordered that were to be collected, of course) is awesome.  The movie totally rocked, and this game brings it all back.

Szeretett téma, jó megvalósítás. A játék pozitívuma a gyors szabályismertetés után a max. fél órás játék, de inkább 15-20 perc egy parti. Izgalmas, jól kiegyenlített felek. A játékmenet a Battle Line-hoz hasonlítható. A játékosok egy-egy helyszínen próbálják felvenni egymással harcot különböző erősségű kártyák kijátszásával. Több érdekes momentum színesíti az egyszerű játékmenetet és némi stratégiázásra is van lehetőség. Jó játék az Aliens, nemcsak rajongóknak ajánlott!

Mark Chaplin's great little card-game homage to the Cameron 'Aliens' movie.  A must for hard-core fans of the film, and a fun game anyway [even my wife liked it - and she lost!].  You work your way through the main locations in the movie, and (somewhat surprisingly, considering the mechanics) the tension and decisions do seem to emulate the Marines' predicament, and the aliens' quest to kill and survive, very well. Close finishes seem to be the norm, and it's just impossible to resist the temptation to name out loud the cards you play, as they are mostly memorable quotes from the film.  It's a hoot, and a good game to boot.  Well done Mark!

An extremely elegant and exceptionally playable game which makes the most of the source material without being overpowered by it, ALIENS TTIW is perfect for a 'beer and pretzels' game evening at home (or even at the pub).

It's quick to learn and succeeds admirably in creating a real sense of tension for both players and I've not finished a game without wanting to play again instantly. 

Just for a vague sense of balance, the card design is pretty basic (screen grabs topped and tailed by block text or film quotes) but are still very atmospheric and frankly I'll take great gameplay over swish graphics anytime.  I can't recommend it highly enough, get yourself a copy now.

 Quite a simple good fun hand management game that plays cleanly and is very entertaining.
 Designed by fellow boardgamegeek user Mark Chaplin (yugblad).
 Theme is pretty much pasted on (the fact that the game has been reimplemented as Revolver,with a western theme proves this),but the gameplay is solid and effective (the fact that the game was noted,picked up and reimplemented as Revolver proves this).
 Always a blast to play games set in the Aliens universe,and encouraging to see the anyone-can-do-it punk ethic ported over to game design.
 Yugblad deserves your support.

I just can't fault this game, especially considering it's free.  Yes, I realise you can pay for the cards from Artscow, but you don't have to do that.  I did (Thank you Lines42, you did an amazing job) and it was worth every penny; probably cheaper than the printer ink it would have used had I printed them off myself and certainly far less bother.  As a big Aliens fan, the game itself totally hits the mark for me.  Fantastic fun.

RATING: N/A
I had a huge amount of fun designing this game, and it gave me a great excuse to re-watch the film another dozen times or so. Just researching the correct designation for each bit of kit was fun for a giant Aliens nerd like me; also making sure each card with an alien exploding, in a shower of acid and bio-mechanical limbs, had a different movie frame.

It has also been extremely gratifying that so many other Aliens fans have liked the game, and thought it a worthy addition to their games collection. Nothing could have been worse, from a designer's perspective, if folks thought that I hadn't done justice to Cameron's masterpiece. You may also be interested to learn that [i]White Goblin Games[/i] have bought this game's architecture from me, releasing it at Essen 2011 as the Old West gunfighting game: [b]Revolver: Hang 'em Dead.[/b]



[i]Also, please, if you're going to rate my game a "1", do me the courtesy of playing it. Typically, those that rate games a "1" never contribute anything, and have no comprehension whatsoever regarding the dedication it takes to craft things for others to share. Much easier to trash-talk and piss on the work of others.[/i]

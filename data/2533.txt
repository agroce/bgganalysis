Another one my wife enjoys as do I. Possibly not a good idea to play more than twice in a row or you cna get your sets mixed up..."was I collecting Bat Wings this game or last?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a sort of a cross between a memory game and a set collecting game, but there are twists and turns along the way.  The scoring makes it more edgy - you don't want to end up with one of a type and you do want to try to get cards of your colour.  Also, you can control, to a large degree, which row you go to next by picking the right card from the ones on offer this turn.  Of course, you have to trade this off against a card that you do need for a set but which will take you somewhere else next go.  The hat and exploding cauldron abilities add a nice touch.  I haven't used the spell cards yet - I suspect that the game will not need them, but I'll try them anyhow.

This is a good game to play with kids over about 7, too.  They like the game and they like the theme!

Nice, light, two player set collection game with a memory element that doesn't tax your brain too much. Works well with children as well as adults. The rules are simple and the game plays quickly. The variant recipe cards can be added for a change of pace but the game is great with or without them.

Drafting, MultiOnly, Memory

I have two copies of this!
  
This is definitely a comfort game for me.  The memory element adds a sliding scale of luck, there's enough strategy but not too much to drive you crazy.  The prescription cards add a nice dimension to the game.
  
I keep this game around because it's a truly pleasant comfort game for me, and is a memory game with interesting mechanics apart from the memory aspect.  The theme is whimsical (though some would argue that it's dark), and fits in well after a bout of Harry Potter reading.  ;)

This is a fun game.  The pictures on the cards are really great, although the bats and feathers do look alot alike.  This would be a 10 if it weren't possible to get stuck moving from corner to corner.  This happens when your last card is a 4 and you have to pass your opponents' pawn every turn.  You don't get to take a card when you land on a corner, so getting stuck this way really ruins the game.  However, once you see this happen, you definitely learn to avoid that situation in the future.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The base game is quite ignorable.  Actually the whole game is very ignorable if you try and play it the way it presents itself: as a light filler.  Kupferkessel is however more than a light filler and if played with some deliberation (and the recipe cards) suddenly emerges as one of the better counting games in the same family as Richelieu.

RATING: 6
Amazing, original game.  Relaxing to play, but with opportunities for bursts of high octane brainwork.  The basic game is very easy to play, with lots of choices. It's important to understand the slightly less easy scoring rules to know what tactics to use. Example: Is it worthwhile (in points) to choose an exploding kettle card that does little to help you but sabotages your opponent 4-point set, but in the process you give up a card that you want?  I don't think of myself as enjoying memory games, but I do enjoy that aspect of this game.  I try to use classic memorization-boost techniques from Psychology class I took to help me remember what's in my kettle. When tallying up the points, we use poker chips to help us count through the various positive and negative categories. This is a super fun game; it makes me feel relaxed. Okay, I do feel a bit frustrated when my opponent makes my kettle explode. Ah well... I don't feel compelled to exert all my cerebral effort and still do okay, but when I do feel like it, the payoff does come. I like the theme better than I anticipated because the artwork is fun. The Harry-Potterish feel makes me think I can play the basic game with children (haven't yet though).  I like how this game mixes a bit of the traditional board game grid (chess, reversi) feel through cards.

A solid two player game.  I have to admit, the memory element is the only thing that takes away form this game.  Without it, it's a purely tactical, perfect information game that could really burn the brain!  With the memory element, it remains a fun and challenging two-player wizard's duel!  This is the kind of thing they need to look at before they go all willey-nilly and give the Harry Potter license to any old game..

It's set collecting, sort of like Lost Cities, but 11 categories, and only 4 cards per category. The mechanic of selecting cards is interesting. You can actually plan a few turns ahead. Has a memory aspect, which I usually don't like, but at least when playing with my 7 year old son, it doesn't bother me too much. Haven't played the advanced version with recipes yet, but it looks even better.

After a few gamess, we've started using the secret goal cards to make it even more interesting.  However, after a while it appears that the goals are unbalanced between points and the degree of difficulty.

Fun, light and fast paced set collecting game. Best memory game I have played. Nice art and wooden bits. I think that the category children's game is a bit misleading. Yes, it's a fun family game allright, but so are almost every light Eurogame. It's not particulary for children because you can play quite hard and nasty to squeeze every point from your opponent. 2006-02-11: Actually this is quite nice little game. I like it more and more. Half point up!

Tougher than nails due to the "if you choose this then this is your movement spaces thing". That combined with the zero sum what is the best move to make idea. Combined with the idea that to really play well you have to also try to notice and remember what your opponent is doing.

For the time spent it is a lot of game.

Do something bad for you or good for me? Who knows huh?

My opponent is better than me at it. I love playing it.

I own two copies and have never felt the urge to buy Glastonbury as we are two players only and the components in our versions are really nice.

RATING: 10
Components: Beautiful ingredient cards that are deeply thematic and entirely functional. Clear iconography. The oversized movement pawns are very cool. I finally broke down and actually cut the corner pieces along the dotted lines, and I haven't regretted it.

Experience: Elegant and satisfying design. First, it is a set collection game, focusing on different ingredients, but especially those of my own color. Second, it is a memory game, trying to recall the specific ingredients in my pile. Third, it is surprisingly tactical, with plenty of opportunities to thwart my opponent. Turns are played extremely quickly. I admire how the game can be adapted to the playing style of the players, with it being either leisurely non-interactive, or aggressively combative. Lots of fun every time. One of my very favorite games.

Rated as a kids game.

A game to play with Harry Potter influenced kids. The counting is a bit problematic for the kids but apart from that it's a great game. Light memory aspect and set collecting with a twist.

RATING: 7
Great two player game. 56 cards (1-4 in fourteen types) are dealt out into a 6x6 face up grid. The remainder from a draw deck. Players move their pawns around the outside of this grid, and may claim any card in the row they finish on. Claimed cards are replaced from the deck. Play until one row is completely empty. Score for sets - 1 card in a set is negative, two cards scores zero, three cards score the sum and four cards score 15. Bonus points for most "1" value cards taken, and points you take in your colour are doubled. There is an advanced version with hidden bonus scoring possible. Fast playing with some nice memory/plan ahead elements. Recommended. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite a fun little game.  This is the perfect example of a game where my partner Kelsey has a serious advantage over me, due to her excellent skill at keeping track of multiple pieces of in-game information.  She's also quite good at planning ahead.  In our first play, she was planning several turns ahead, executing her turns much faster than me, and had a clear picture of where her score stood in comparison to mine.  Perhaps it was the late night hour, but I was barely able to plan two moves ahead, and was focused on keeping track of which ingredients I collected, paying no attention to my opponent!  Needless to say, her final score completely crushed mine.  I'm looking forward to trying again, and trying to pay better attention, however I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to beat her.  It's quite intimidating!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Curious two-plyer set-collectio game: you leapfrog aroudn the outside of the board, and the card you taek has a point value, a movement score for your next move, and also possibly a special action as well. The game is convoluted enough to make it good for friendy play, yest not so complex that it would scare off a new player. A very good balance here. I've only played the basic game, but I look forward to adding the recipe card.

It's a pretty and quick 2 player game. The scoring involves a bit more math and the usual light games but it simple enough if you follow the scoring summary sheets. I was a bit worried first about the memory aspect of the game but there weren't too many types of cards you had to remember. It's surprising how quick the flow can get even when planning ahead 1 or 2 moved and checking out the opponents options.

This quick two-player game of set collection and lookahead almost seems to play itself, yet I find it strangely compelling.  Don't be scared off by the "memory game" descriptions, as I was.

This is a great little two player set collection game, with a lot of meta-gaming going on for a game which is basically a deck of square cards and two nice wooden pawns.

The game involves some luck- the card shuffle determines board layout, starting cards, and reserve deck order- but the play is based on the cards selected- card number determines #spaces moved- and on the changing tableau of cards to select.

A variant game adds hidden bonus cards for completing recipes, and a bit more luck/goals for end-game points, but both games offer some interactive play, move planning, and rely on memory to recall what is in yours/your opponents' stacks (kettles).

Game end is triggered when one shelf (row) is emptied, so there are always some components one cannot obtain, and move planning can control game end to some extent.

The pawns for the game are as nice as any I have ever seen, and the cards have good artwork.  The whole thing is the same size or smaller than an Alea mid-size box, but it really packs a decent amount of game and play into a very small package.

This makes a nice 2-player game, and I'd have to place it with Lost Cities & Morels as among the best I've played. It took a while to find a decently priced copy, but it is obvious why it was a Spiel de Jahres recommended game, and why folks are still looking for copies.

There's a lot to love about this little gem: (1) the playing time is short enough to create suspense, but long enough that your choices matter, (2) the mechanics are interesting but easy to understand and explain, (3) the scoring gives you some opportunities for various strategies, and (4) there is just enough player interaction to give you that sense of conflict but not enough that anyone is going to get really frustrated.

The basic game is beautifully designed and produced. I have yet to try the recipe-card variant, but I'm looking forward to it.

It's very relaxing, and the big wooden pawns make a nice noise as you move them around the edge of the cards.  The memory element is not as difficult as it initially seems, but it seems like you don't want to get into the rut of only collecting what your opponent is not, which is what I was doing.  As long as you're paying attention, it's pretty easy to judge what's going on.  I like that it plays quickly and looks nice on the table.  It's nothing earthshattering, but it has a nice scoring system (reminds me of Lost Cities, actually) and pleasant artwork, even if I'm not usually a fan of fantasy themes.

Played it for the first time with my sister in a board games cafe in Paris (OYA), and loved it enough to go buy a copy the next day at Déscartes-Écoles. Excellent lightly-themed tactical game, plays very quickly, and is super-easy to teach as well. Some fiddliness with the scoring doesn't matter when the game plays so quickly that you can easily play a full practice game to teach the scoring.I heartily recommend it for any fan of light, quick, two-player games that don't feel dependent on chance.

My wife enjoys this, too, for some reason, though it's lighter than the stuff she usually picks (Race for the Galaxy, Dominion base-set, Industria, Through the Desert).

I love this game, but my adult opponents have been lukewarm toward it. I've also played this with kids, and it's neat to see them figure out how to look ahead to the next move.

The memory element is secondary and no more taxing than a typical traditional card game. Here, there are 4 ranks in 14 suits, and keeping track of ranks is not essential.

The three-player variant is good and faithful to the two-player game. I still haven't gotten around to the advanced game after many plays. Neither of Burkhardt's more recent riffs on this game allow you to play the original two-player [i]Kupferkessel[/i], which is a pity.

One play with a 5 year-old that "cleaned my clock." I had a great time and would play the game again. I think there is more strategy here than meets the eye, as the cards you choose determine how far you get to move the next turn and, therefore, which cards are available to you. The theme and graphics are engaging as well.

It's important to note that we played Kupferkessel Co. for the first time in June of 2014. I wanted to mention that because I was fairly certain that unless this game had something fresh and "classic" about it, it would be hard not to dismiss it as outdated. Thankfully, it met both criteria. This game is awesome. It's just a quick little card game with simple movement, but it's so elegant and cute. I love it. My wife loves it. Incidentally, we played this for the first time immediately after our first play of Splendor (2014). This was far and away our favorite of the two (rated splendor a 7 after 1 play). Great game, wish it wasn't out of print and hard to find. Every couple should have this in their collection!

Update: 11/8/2014: This continues to be one of my wife's favorite 2-player games. I would have to agree.

It's a very simple collection game with a minimal (IMHO) memory element.  Players move their pawns (magicians) around a 6X6 grid and each turn they choose a commodity (magic ingredient) from the row their on.  The ingredients are replineshed until the ingredient stack runs out in which case the game continues until all the ingredients in one row are taken.  Each ingredient contains a value which is also how many steps around the grid your magician will move next turn.  Players score negative points for having one type of ingredient (one of a set of four) at the end of the game.  Zero points for a pair, face value for 3-of-a-kind and 15 points for collecting the entire set.  There are a few other scoring bonuses too.  I found the game to be engaging and there are some choices to be made (offensively and defensively).

I enjoy this game.  I think it is a very clever design and the memory aspect is great for kids.

RATING: 6
Move your pawn token around a matrix of cards to collect different ingredients. Neat set collection aspect to game, but there were a couple of things I noticed 1) the first player has an advantage in collecting mushrooms/magic wands (to get more turns as they go first), unless the first player gets a poor start card, then the second player has a chance at a run of the good bonus cards 2) The opponent may be able to put a pawn in your way, and mess up your planning (though it could be argued you could do the same) potentially causing you to hit a corner and miss a turn 3) the recipe cards (for special conditions VPs) appear to be unequal in value, maybe play without them. Maybe if the special bonus cards/exploding kettle cards were not present, it may make for a more strategic game.

Kupferkessel is a superb short game that merges collecting sets of tiles (the corresponding scoring system is both clear and slightly eccentric), positional play (the pieces' ability to move depend on the last collected tile) and a memory element (players can only see the last tile they collect). 

With its very pretty artwork (boasting the usual Goldsieber quality) and the balance with which the deck of tiles has been built the game is beautiful both in presentation and content. The very crisp rules are explained in two or three minutes, and the play is tense throughout as the choices are far from trivial.

There's a narrow possibility that luck pushes a player too far forward, but that shouldn't blind anyone - Kupferkessel is a jewel.

It is one of my favourite light games. I can play it, play and once more play. But after so many plays in one evening I forget what I took to my "Kupferkessel". But that makes the game fun!

Played the basic rules so far (without recipe cards) and am unsure that I actually "get" it. From what I've seen you are simply moving around the board collecting sets. Maybe I need to concentrate on what my opponent is collecting and try to introduce a little more "screwage", but at the moment I'm struggling to see the game here. 

Note the above comments are based on my first game.

Kupferkessel Co. features some very beautiful artwork, but that isn't all it has going for it.  With most games I've played I have had at least a rough idea how well my opponent was doing with respect to myself. Since that was not the case with Kupferkessel Co, I found the game to be all the more suspenseful.  The memory component makes it tricky if you play multiple games in succession.  Lots of fun, and love that exploding pot! (5+5)

RATING: 9
50+ plays. A super spouse game. You can't play it back to back for long because there's a key memory element (ie what you've collected so far) that you can accidently mix up from game to game, but it's had excellent staying power over the years. Nearly every turn provides a delicious decision - do you take something you want to collect to maximise your points and end up moving to a bad spot, or take something that doesn't help you score much but sets you up for better plays next turn and the turn after (and after that, etc, based on how much look ahead you want to do). And there's always the risk that your best layed plays may be wrought asunder by your opponent killing off the last card you collected, moving you somewhere you weren't expecting and having to re-plan. It's easy to pull out, easy to teach, quick to play and you have the choice of concentrating on your own game or playing to interfere, depending on your preferred playing style. It does require you to remember which sets you've collected so far, but as you'll only (hopefully) be collecting 5-7 sets this isn't too hard, and actually provides part of the joy as you get halfway in and suddenly can't remember if you already have one of those and you need to add to it or not - oops! But minor hiccups like this don't penalise you too much in the big scheme. Lastly, it has the advantage of being playable with the kids and providing them practice at some key game skills (lookahead, etc) which is a bonus.

This is a neat little game.  I played it 3P and it is really only meant to be a two player game, but I think I got a good perspective of what it's like.

It's got a memory element, which I'd guess a lot of people wouldn't like.  Generally, I don't like games with a memory element, but in this game it really helps reduce the AP.  It's a game that's meant to be played fast and those are the sort of games that I really enjoy.

There is a grid of tiles and the players circle the tiles picking up a tile from the row they land in and adding it to their stack.  Each tile has a number which determines the number of points a player receives from the tile as well as the movement for the next turn.  Players want to collect certain sets of tiles.  The person with the most points at the end is the winner.

It plays fast and fun and there's a lot of player interaction.  It's a solid game.

Another great 2 player game.  A combination of memory and planning/"move counting" make this one very tactical.  The cards have a magical/witchcraft theme to them which I have heard turns some people off, but I say, the art is beautiful and the game is brilliant!

I don't know why this game is listed so high in price. Actually it's not my game, although its memory-training for the brain is a nice thing. In additon the art is sweet.

EDIT:
(Rated up from 6 to 7.2)
After more plays I have to say: this is a small gem with tactical necessity and smart complexity.

EDIT 2: Traded it for "Kolejka".

Much better than Lost Cities for a light two player romp. I wouldn't call it a memory game at all (the notion almost scared me off) - there's not that much to remember!... unless you play a couple of games in a row - that can get confusing! Tactics are the key. There's more to this when you start to try out different tactics. The odd negative point here or there can be well worth the placement. I was pleasantly surprised by this game and recommend it to all. Plays really well with my six year old.

RATING: 7.5
Quite a lot of rules have to be explained for this 15-min filler, but once past that, the gameplay is intuitive and really quick. The scoring reminds me of Coloretto and Lost Cities - you have to be careful when you start collecting a set, or you'll end up with nothing, or even worse, negative points.

Although there are 14 different sets to remember, the memory element doesn't dominate the game as there are some visual hints to help you memorise what cards you have, e.g. there are 2 sets which share the same colour.

There is more control over the sets you collect than that in Lost Cities. This game got competitive once I realised that it's better to grab cards to deny my opponent from completing his or her set (thus earning the 5 bonus points), even if it meant getting the odd negative point once in a while. 

I currently play a homebrew version, but would love to own this game one day.

RATING: 5
Fun game! I have only played the basic version, which is a very light game. It's a set collecting kind of game with a very minor memory component. I LOVE the theme of rival alchemists trying to collect potion ingredients! The art is beautiful, which helps immerse you in the game. Plays quick. Looking forward to trying the included variants. I can see my rating going up if the variant increase the strategizing.

Update: Well, I played the variant where each player plays with secret ingredient cards - each outlining a goal which, if met, awards the player bonus points. Having a hidden goal adds to the experience, but my feeling about the game has ironically dropped from 7.5 to 5 with repeated plays. I do think this is a neat game.

CHILDREN's RATING: 8

This is a light, entertaining game which I can play with my daughter - and I appreciate that. At 4/5 she can easily grasp the basic game, even if she sometimes prefers to choose cards that are not maximally helpful to here. Against an adult, it is also fun if you want to tax your memory a little, and games are generally very tight - but on the whole, I'd usually rather play something else with an adult.

This is a fun little diddy of a game.  Even though this does have a little bit of a memory element it certainly isn't the driving force behind the fun.  Really this is a movement and aquisition management game.  This is really quite a lovely system.  I have to say that I quite enjoy the base game.  As much as I figured that the advanced rules (secret missions) would add to the game, I really feel that they throw an uneeded randomness into the system.

This is certainly worth busting out for a couple games in a row.

The ingeneous Tom Pancoast suggested to use two mission cards face up and have victory conditions apply to all.  He sure is a swell guy isn't he?

So long as you don't mind a mild memory component, this is a fun and quick option.  Your choice each round has to balance what you are trying to collect with where you want to move next turn, since the card picked dictates the next round's movement.

RATING: 7
I can't believe I am saying this but an improvement on Richelieu. The basic game is fantastic. Set collection (14 sets with 4 cards each) with some memory (what did i place in my kettle?) and player screwage involved (bursting kettle, magic hat). Players try to collect ingredients along a 6x6 grid. Pts. are award for 3 and 4 card sets and for sets that are in the same colour as your magician (black / white). Penalties are award for only 1 of each kind (negative pt value) or 2 of a kind (no pts.) Really liked this two player and would definitely get out on the table again. Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A wonderfully elegant design that simply isn't implied when you read the rules but is evident when you play it.  The memory element makes it brainier without being unrealistically burdensome, while the decisions come fast as you try to balance what you're collecting with how far you're going.  Recommended for couples and anyone that wants a quick and entertaining two player game.  I'm proud to have it part of my collection.

RATING: 8
Set collection game with an interesting movement mechanic (value of card you select determine how far you can move next time).  Haven't played it with the recipe cards yet, but the basic game is quick and fun.  I'm not a big fan of memory games, but the memory component of this one (you may only see the last card you collected) works very well.  Kniziaesque scoring.  The three-player variant (requiring the addition of an extra pawn (not included)) works well and makes pawn movement even trickier toward the end of the game.  

Easy set-up, good cafe game, nice graphics.  Good game to play with kids -- no reading required but sufficiently challenging to keep adults engaged.

A fun set-collection game for two, despite the memory element (which I usually don't like, but it's simple enough here -- along the lines of Mamma Mia or TTR Card Game -- that it's not a problem). Quick playing, with good tactical play and some room for planning over several turns, if the other player doesn't interfere with your plans too much!

--- Summary ---
Create a 6x6 grid of ingredient cards (numbered 1-4, 14 ingredient types; 2 each in 5 colors, and the player colors black and white) minus the corners. Place the 2 player pawns on opposite corners. Each player gets a random card (not of their color) in front of them. For the advanced game, players also get 2 recipe cards = bonus points at end of game if you meet the conditions (e.g., at least 3 cards of both ingredients in a color; fewer 4s than the other player, etc.).

On your turn, move clockwise as many spaces around the grid as the number showing on your card stack, then take a card in that row and place on top of your stack (may never look through your stack) -- if land on corner, get nothing. Place the top card from the draw deck in the empty spot. If you drew a card with a magic hat/wand icon, take a second turn (max 2 consecutive turns). If you got a card with an exploding icon, the other player places their top card on the bottom of the draw deck (if deck empty, remove card from game instead). 

The game ends when any row is empty. Then sort your cards by ingredient type and score according to number of each type:
- 1 = negative points
- 2 = 0
- 3 = sum
- 4 = sum + 5 (i.e., 15 VP)
- then, if in your own color, double the value
- score any bonus points from end-game recipes.
Most points wins!

Rushed through a late end of evening play, but it is a unique game that includes a fun mechanic where your pawn movement is dictated by the piece you just collected.  I&#039;ll blame the late hour on my having difficulty remembering which pieces I had collected!

RATING: 8.5
fun, very quick game.  Potential for severe Analysis Paralysis with the wrong opponent.  It's a set collection game with a hint of memory-mechanic (you can't look back to see what sets you are collecting), and a dash of screwage (you want to break up your opponents sets, especially in their color).  I'm not particularly fond of the secret recipes additon for the "advanced" game since that can often mean a bigger swing in luck--depending on initial card set-up it might be very easy or very difficult for someone to pick up their recipe.

Heh, I'm really surprised at Clearclaw's fondness of the recipe cards...so odd to have him in favor of a mechanic that is not only 'hidden' but also introduces more randomness.  Though I do definitely agree that the game should be played with real deliberation--the rewards in challenge and play for planning several turns in advance are great.

Like this game format/mechanism (cards layed out in a grid) with Player pawns moving around the outside of the grid - acting on the grid cards in a pawn row.  Compare with Herr der Ziegen (or more loosely with Game Over).  Created a game with influences from these two games.

This is a really, really nice "little" design with just enough complication to work for the (short) length of time it plays.  The way cornering works is a subtle but essential design touch.  P.S. I've never played this with a kid.  Adults like it; kids might, too.

[Goldsieber 2001 edition] {couple; memory, set collection} {basic 7} KC is a nice game for 2 players, esp. good for a couple. It has a reasonable theme. The rule is easy to teach and understand. Short game turn and smooth game play. Right amount of randomness with some decisions; good replayability. Moderately interactive, slightly nasty. Players have to memorize what ingredients they collected but it's not taxing.

The illustration of card fits the theme well. I haven't cut the corner cards. Each ingredient can be easily recognized. The colors are color-blind friendly. The box is too large (I have a distaste of big boxes). I wish that the pawns are magician (similar to Mago Magino's). The current pawns are too dry. 

Looking forward to the variant and 3p game.

Rating based on a single play of the basic game with my 8 yr. old daughter. I liked the memory aspect used in this game. The movement rules really give you a good amount of control over your next couple of moves. The exploding cauldron cards really add a nice take that mechanic to the game, that when used right can really stick the other guy with some negative points.

Neglected for a long time, then prompted to play just because someone looking to buy it made me think too hard. :)

Set collection, where the card you choose dictates your movement next turn, and restricts which card you choose next. Scoring is everything, so being able to remember what your stack of cards contains is useful, and explains why I might never win  at this game.

Only tried the basic 2-player version. Will hopefully try 3-player and the recipe cards soon.

I like this more than any of the Kosmos 2-player games right now, even Lost Cities. Like LC, it plays quickly (10-15 minutes) and begs to be played again right away.

Having finally played with the extra cards, I must say it's also excellent that way. 

This one would have been great to release in English a couple of years ago with a Harry Potter tie-in. Wouldn't have needed anything changed, except the title.

One of the best two-play games out there, bar none.

The movement rules add enough strategy to make it more than just a memory game.  Good quick, light game that is great with kids as well as adults.  I find it hard to play more than once (or maybe twice) per sitting because I mix up which sets I am collecting in the current game versus prior games.

Nice little fast card game.  It reminds me of Coloretto, but with a memory element and much less chaos.  You don't want to start new sets unless you know you can at least get another one.  The memory element had me nervous, but it is fairly mild, and the items in the game are distinctive.  We didn't play with the advanced scoring cards.  I would be concerned about their effect on balance, but it didn't matter, since the game played pretty well without them.

This is a nifty little brain burner of a game, with a touch of cutthroat-ness thrown in to make things a little interesting.  There's a lot of passive-aggressiveness here, as well, since you'll find yourself in a position to hurt someone else a bit, but if you don't help yourself at the same time, you'll get hurt yourself, since lone cards from a set will count against you.  The game is nicely balanced and has a lot of interesting decisions to make along the way.

I've played 10 games now, 3 of which used the recipes and I'm fairly certain this beautiful game is on its way to become a fixture as a quick light gaming snack. Works well with three as well, all though some adjustments to the recipes cards needs to be made.

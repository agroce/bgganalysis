My copy is completely in German, but its pretty self-expnantory so don't let that bother you. There is a good game here but it misses the mark abit. Not enough conflict between players in what is basically an area control game makes ut a trifle dull.

The primary mechanic is leader bashing.

On your turn, you pick the guy who CHOOSES who gets screwed.  The net effect: those who are ahead get repeatedly screwed.  Normally, if the mechanic is: 'on your turn, screw someone', then at least on the leader's turn, he can screw someone else.  But not here!  No, in Mammoth Hunters on his turn the leader picks someone else who chooses who gets screwed, who then screws the leader...until a new player is the leader, and another....and you hope its you when the clock finally runs out, but not before!

This game was the most disappointing boardgame ever for me, as it was an Alan Moon / Aaron Weisbloom release AND an Alea game in the big box series...

I would rather play monopoly...

If I could only veto one game, and someone was picking a game to play, at andom, I would veto this game...

I have played it once. I was last the whole time and still managed to come in last place even though the last place player gets an advantage over the other players at the end of each round. The game basically comes down to timing... and I was always springing my move too early allowing other players time to adjust or counter.

Finally got a chance to play this.  Not as random as I had feared, but it plays a little long.  The interesting question is whether this is a purely tactical game where things don't really matter much until the last round, or if there is some subtle strategic issues at play.  Unfortunately I don't think the game is sufficiently intriquing to elicit replay....

{1 play, 3 players} After hearing some bad buzz, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.  We played 3-player, so it moved along fairly quickly, but if adding a 4th or 5th player drags it out, well... and the thing is, I'm guessing, gameplay-wise, it probably plays better with 4 or 5.  Also, the hosage/bashing was semi-predictable and didn't feel so bad with only 3 players.  I can see how a "wrong" move in a 4 or 5 player game might really sour you.

RATING: 8
I have to say that I don't really understand the complaints about this game I read here on the Geek. We took about 70 minutes to play our first game, including the rules explanation. The game was pretty quick-moving, and definitely amusing, and there's a good amount of strategy as well. I definitely want to play this some more.

Another beautiful Alea game. Innovative in it's use of the "bad" cards to generate currency for the "good" cards. Unfortunately, the sum of the mechanics turns the game into a metagaming experience. Might be okay for families but probably a bit too much on the nasty side, making it a tough sell.

RATING: 7.5
It didn't take long to get going in the game as it isn't a very difficult game to learn. If someone tells you there is no conflict in Euros, well, this game is the exception to the rule. Light and Dark cards which makes you have to balance your play either by playing light cards to help you or the dark cards which help others. Have to play dark to get currency to be able to play the light. At least with four people, you run through the decks a few times. It makes for some very interesting plays. Even though you have luck of the card draw and the chaos of people playing cards where you lose hunters there is still much you can plan for (plan for being fluid, that is for certain). I enjoyed this one...it's lively and fun. I'm surprised this gets panned here.

Looking to get German version just for the number.  :)

RATING: 6
A terribly underrated game. Involves majority control more than area control and, a surprisingly unique game mechanic of light and dark cards, which involve hurting or helping your enemy to help yourself which shift the balance in the game, I enjoy this mechanic a lot.

 Has a few glyches in the mechanics, specifically around the strategy of not knowing the campfire values while playing till you score, which I find silly. Easily house ruled remedied if you flip them over after one round around the table and enhances the strategy when you know them nearly right off than people fight for space just like the theme should employ.

Currently testing a add on to the game "beware the sabertooth"(taking opponents points away) and variant of the game that utilizes collecting "successful hunt" points from the mammoths.

The more you play this game the more you'll like it.

I'm not a huge fan of area majority games to begin with and this one takes WAY too long to be any fun (with 5 players, anyway).

There's a good start to a game in there, but I think it needs a bit more polishing to make it shine.

I find this game to be rather fun - it moves along nicely, good tension in the choices, and it has a distinctly "El Grande, the low-calorie version" feel. I liked it, and the immediate impression was that this is the best of Alan Moon since Union Pacific. On the other hand, there may be a significant "whack the leader" issue, since probably every third card that's played is a hoser of some nature. Like Bohn Hansa, I was generally more pleased with the game than the group in general, although everyone liked it to some degree I think. For an alea game, certainly not up to the standards of most of the entries in their line, but a solid game nontheless I thought.

No game so solidifies how bash the leader can ruin a game than this one.  I piss on tactical games like this where the game basically flat out tells you not to be a good player.

Maybe, El Grande light?  There is, as has been alluded to, quite a bit of chaos in this game, but it's still fun.  I could see playing this when I'm not in the mood for the cutthroat tension and length of El Grande.  Plus, it fits in well with "Neanderthal Games Night" right after "Settlers of the Stone Age" and "Wildlife".  ;)

I think this one may be a bit better than the ranking here, but not a LOT better. There are notable plusses. 

Firstly, the theme and components are great. The mammoth meeples are cool...and the theme works for me.

But mainly, the timing and economy are cool. Deciding whether to play a card to help yourself and pay, or help others and receive income...that's a neat touch. Also, you want to not end the game sitting on a big pot of dough.

There is a certain amount of "beat up the leader", but it plays quickly and seemed fun. I think with 5 players it may be too chaotic to really enjoy. Maybe best with 3?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Another Moon area majority game which has some good ideas, but ends up falling short on many fronts. Good ideas: The Club to save lonely tribes. The destruction of areas by glaciers. Bad facets: The club is underpowered because it leaves after only 1/4 of the game is complete. The glaciers are controlled by the last place player and have a beat on the leader(s) effect. The dark cards, by and large, also have a beat on the leader effect. The card draw can hand people good stuff repeatedly, and is the only mechanism for putting stuff on the board. The card draw is blind, so you have no way to prepare for what's coming. Need I continue? I don't think this game is utterly atrocious, despite the above negatives, but it's really down there in terms of both the alea lineage, and the area influence genre for me. I think the game could have been much better if the neat glacier mechanic, instead of being controlled by the last place player, went in a certain pre-determined pattern with the region that was going to be iced over next receiving some sort of substantial scoring bonus to lure people in for a score at the cost of pieces on the board for the future. Of course, other changes would be necessary, perhaps the non-glacier target regions each doling out a certain power for control, but not very many points or something like that. In other words: this game feels like with more work it could have been really interesting, as it stands, bleh. If you're really intent on playing a Moon card driven area influence game I would recommend Wongar over this, though I also think that has some issues.

Production: Nice board and wooden bits.  The cards are nothing special, though they do have helpful illustrations for each action.  Play: The intriguing central mechanism of having to balance costly, selfish actions with rewarding, self-damaging actions didn't pan out for me.  It felt like just another game of trying to get majorities in regions, and using special action cards to shift pawns around the board. (2+0+2) (1 play)

The game has a unique mechanic in that it takes money (stones in this game) to perform actions that benefit you. However, you must play cards that benefit other players to earn money. Turn ends when all the money in the pool has been earned so you do not know exactly when the game ends. The player with the lowest score gets to glaciate a region at the end of each turn, killing everything in it. This prevents a runaway winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's like a mini version of El Grande.  Put some guys in a region.  You score that amount of points times however many mammoths are in that region (max=2).  I like it and would play again.  Not sure how much depth and replayability are there though.  You mostly collect stones early in the round and try to cash them all in right before the round ends.  Has a good amount of "take that"...so beware if you don't like that kind of thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another majorities game where players are scoring points for getting little wooden pieces into areas.  If you get them where the mammoths are, you score more points than if not.  Interesting mechanic of earning money to help others which I've only ever seen in one other game - 6 Billion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent game, can be a bit slow because there are quite a lot of options to consider each turn.  The downside is that there are so many balancing factors that it's hard to lose by more than a few points unless you're really trying... which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't a 2-hour game.  Three rounds is probably enough, which should reduce it to 90 minutes or so.

Hosszú idő után került újra elő a játék, de még mindig tetszik.
A jégkorszakban a jég elöl menekülve, gyűjtögetünk, mamutra vadászunk, stb. Terület-többségi játék, de mégse  teljesen: a többség a pontozásnál nem számít, csak a harcnál.
Világos -nekünk jó- és sötét -a többieknek kedvező- kártyáink vannak, 5 lap a kézben és mindkét színből kell lennie. Ha magunknak kedvezőt játszunk ki, akkor fizetni kell érte, ha másnak kedvezőt akkor pénzt kapunk érte a sötét kártya talonjából. Ha ez a pénz elfogy a talonból, akkor forduló vége, és a területek ellenőrzése jön: miden terület adott mennyiségű vadászt tud eltartani. (Ezeket és a mamutokat meg a tábortüzeket pakolgatjuk a kártyák segítségével). Alapban hármat plusz a tábortűz értéke, ami csak ekkor derül ki és 0-2 közt van, plusz 1 minden mamut miatt a területen. Ha több vadász van: akkor leesnek a területről. És itt a másik jó ötlet -a kártya után- Először a legkevesebb ott lévő vadásszal lévő játékos veszi le 1 vadászát, ha még mindig sokan, akkor a második legkevesebbel, stb. Ha egyformaság van, akkor a holtversenyben állók mindegyike 1xre 1-et. Ha miden területen már csak annyi vadász van, amennyit elbír tartani, jön az értékelés: minden fent lévő vadász pontot hoz a játékosának. 1-et sima terülten, 2-t, ha van 1 mamut a területen,és 3-at, ha több mamut van a területen. Majd akinek a legkevesebb pontja van a forduló után, az letehet egy jégglecsert vmelyik területre, ezzel kiiktatva azt -s a rajta lévő vadászok visszakerülnek a játékosok talonjába- a köv körből.
Új forduló.
Összesen 4 forduló, és ennyi.
Egyszerű szabályok, izgalmas játékmenet, a kártyákkal okosan kell bánni, nekem jót v inkább pénzt szerezzek, ha pénz kell akkor melyik rossz lapot játsszam ki, és kivel játszassam meg, h nekem ne ártson nagyon...
Sajnos a kártyák nyelvfüggőek, ugyan mindegyiken ábra is segít, de azért 4-5-6-7 játékig az ember a szöveggel boldogul. Szerencsére ezt már rég lemagyarítottam - igaz még nem kártyagyáras volt, hanem házi készítésű, fóliázott, de teljesen jó minőség. Így ez nem zavar :-)

I have to agree with those that believe this game has received unfair due.  Mammoth Hunters is a clever card driven area control game that offers plenty of fun for it's relatively quick playing time. I also agree when people say that if Mammoth Hunters hadn't been stamped with the Alea tag it's reception would have been much warmer.  The clever balance between playing light and dark cards creates wonderful tension, as it is inevitable that you will have to benefit someone else - which in turn can transform your act of necessary charity into an unwanted experience in masochism. Positioning one's self in this game is the real challenge. Because of the aforementioned consequences one might face when forced into dark card play there is a real balance of where to place yourself in respect to scoring in the present round and in overall position until the final round.   Leaders will always get swept away by the ice flow and nailed with dark cards, so knowing when to push for the lead is pivotal.  Mammoth Hunters offers a lot of thought while still remaining to feel light and fun.

UPDATE:  I want to announce that Mammoth Hunters still sits highly on my list of games enjoyed, plus I want to pipe in on people that call this El Grande light.  I believe the comparisson is an overwhelming simplification of defining an area control game.  For me, Mammoth Hunters stands alone from El Grande and offers a wonderful and individual gaming experience.

Wongar in sheep's clothing. Avoid if you dislike Wongar. Rated 1 lower than Wongar, because it's not as pleasant to look at. The only thing keeping this game in my collection is to keep my Alea numbered set complete. I should have taken it as a sign that they forgot to print the "8" on the US version.

I'm not sure that the "dark card" system is a good idea.  It turns an already chaotic game into an acrimonious exercise in beating down the leader.  Better to just vote on who should win (not altogether unlike what actually happens), and get on with playing something interesting.

RATING: 7
I really like the mechanism to get &quot;stones&quot; to give opponents advantage and pay &quot;stones&quot; to get an advantage yourself, although it&#039;s a bit too much of hunting the current leader. Unfortunately the game is a bit too chaotic, due to the cards you get. I might buy the English version later on, but it&#039;s not a must.

3-player game :

Plays very smoothly, some very nice balancing mechanics (get money and help others, pay it to help yourself). 

It seem to pay off to be in last place (until the last year of course).

RATING: N/A
One play with four. I really wanted to like this one, but I ended up feeling like it was just "okay," or even maybe comparatively weak. There were certainly enjoyable things about it--there was lots of scope for clever moves, it was a fun challenge to try to time your "big move" just before the end of the round, and getting to slap down the glacier was a lot of fun. However, there was a bit of disconnect between what you put in and what you get out of it; you need to think about your moves because the short term stuff can all be figured out, but long-term there's a lot of unpredictability. If I'm going to put a lot of effort into a game, I want there to be some potentially achievable long-term goal that I'm working towards. The game was also a little bit repetitious; one of the guys was tired and wanted to quit after the third round, and I was actually okay with calling the game (though of course I was far out of contention...).

Very nice game, "in between chairs": a little too complex for non-gamers, and maybe not enough controllable for hard-core freaks...

But I like it: fun, easy, with a clever "should a pay to play a card that gives me an advantage, or get some cash by playing a card that helps my opponents?" twist.

Some pictures on the cards could have been just a little easier to understand.

RATING: 6
Quite enjoyable game, but it can be easily spoiled by a bad player - or someone with a bad attitude. You must pay to play cards that allow you to perform an action, but the only way to get the money is to play another type of card that gives actions to one opponent of your choice (or all opponents, depending on the card). It is a clever mechanic, but it limits the people with whom I will enjoy playing the game. It's much better when you play with players who base their choices solely on the board situation, but this also has a problem: because scores are open, bashing the leader is a big factor. Besides, as there can be drastic changes with a single card play, too much depends on timing, on playing a particular card when you expect someone to trigger scoring.

While the game has some cool ideas, the impact of the cards is too big, which makes it pretty much a chaotic game where people can't plan ahead much. The more players you add, the more chaotic it gets.

I would still call it a very good family game, though. It's just not much of a strategy game, which I prefer.

Has mechanics I really like. The stone ("money")-handling via the cards. The way the ice grows and so making the area smaller. But... although better then other majority-games I saw this year, it's finally just 'another majority game'.
And beside that I am also not very happy with all those "chase the one in lead" games anymore.
So perhaps it would have been a 9+ ... when we would be some years back. I feel like rating it even lower for all the things I mentioned, but as there are some nice ideas, I can give a 6.

This game is very typical of Moon games, in that the mechanisms to rein in the leader or entirely driven by the other players.  This can lead to bad feelings, especially if the perceived leader isn't the real leader.  Games are close, and it feels that there might be thoughts of "Why be first, that just gets me killed?" until the last round.

The only reason it's on my wishlist is to complete the alea big box set.

First played August 7th, 2008. Taught in 15min, played in about an hour with 4 players. This game has good luck/strategy balance. It's played over 4 ages. 2 Glaciers and 4 Mammoths are place on the board. Each player places 6 followers one at a time in rotation. Each player starting with the start player plays one card a dark(collect rocks for income and lets one of your opponents do an action specified on the card) or lite(pay rocks and you take the action specified on the card) card. After playing a card, you may discard one card and then redraw your hand up to 5 cards with no more that 4 of one type of card. The round is over when all rocks are taken for the dark pile stash. There are also food dics ranging from 0-2. Each square feeds 3 followers and a Mammoth adds 1. All followers need to eat and the ones that can't are removed from play. They are removed by the player with the least amount of followers (removing any ties at the same time) followed by the next highest number of followers, to the highest before returning to the lowest if they still need to be removed. A club can also protect one follower from this conflict. A scoring round follows and the last place person picks the spot that the glacier is placed. Each follower gets 1pt for just surviving, 2pts in a square with a Mammoth and 3pts with 2 or more Mammoths. After scoring, remove all food and club chits. Then all rocks in the lite color are moved to the dark side. If the dark side is short, pay out of the lite before doing the scoring. I'd recommend giving this a try for those who are looking for another new game to try out.

Tense game. Ultimate screw you game.  YOU give a player a card hoping he'll screw someone else with it but then the knife goes firmly in YOUR back. THE BEST mechanic is that whoever gets picked on and is in last place after each turn gets REVENGE! You can be losing and have more fun than the leader as you place a sheet of ice over an entire region of their pieces.

The area control mechanics and prehistoric theme work well together. I like how the mammoths move around the board and change the inherent value of a region. The light card / dark card mechanic is pretty nifty too. The ability for the last place player to decide where the ice sheets expand is the huge screwage factor in this game. Don't play this game if you're the type of player who'll get angry when someone nuke blasts your best region and all of your associated pieces right off of the board. Not something I need to buy, but I'll be up for a game every once in a while.

The chaotic nature leaves some flat.  If you know/understand this going in it shouldn't be a problem.  You lose some control over your plan, but at the gaim of some tension and unknown.Also, the mechanic used for purchasing cards and gaining income is BRILLIANT!.Perhaps, if that system alone was put to a game where players had full control over their destinies and chaos didn't reign, this game would rate a 9 or so!  At least for me  ;)

Tactical game that feels very chaotic but nevertheless has some original balancing elements. I especially like the mechanism with the two sets of cards. One with positive actions for which you have to pay and one with negative actions (mmmh, actually positive actions for the other players!) from which you get "money". The player in the last position of a round also has the pleasure to place an ice-tile. The luck elements and lack of control fit nicely with the theme and still provide for an agreeable and challenging game. Plays surprisingly well with 5 players.

This would definitely be my least favorite Alea and is only present in my collection because I have all the other titles.  I probably should have seen this coming when my gameboard split in half in seeking to flatten it (at least its still quite playable if I ever choose to revisit this title...which is doubtful).  The game is largely focused on area majority based on a clever concept for card play (dark cards are played to gain money but allow other players to do nasty things to yourself and/or possibly others AND light cards you pay money to play which help you gain men, mammoths, or firepits in the regions of your choice).  There is strategy as you seek to hedge your bets but avoid being in the lead in the final round at all costs.  While cardplay was intriguing and unique, the play was less than dynamic and was too random for what I prefer in area majority games and really lacks replay value in my mind as there are only around 8-10 different types of cards for each of the two shades.  Great concept, poor execution describes this game in a nutshell from my perception.

Played once with 4 players and only 3 rounds (the published shortend game variant).  The game took 70 minutes to complete not including explanation.  The game may have a bit too much take that element to it where true control is elusive.  For example, I move a mammoth to my territory then the next player moves it to his territory, then another player takes it off the board, then I move it back to my territory and so on.  The link between the money system and ending the settler phase is clever though.
Ok..played a full 4 rounds with 5 players.  The game took 2 hours and I felt I had really no control, even while trying to keep an eye out for people's money situation.  I place a mammoth, bob removes it, carl places it somewhere else.  Not my cup of tea.

Ok, I liked how the pool of action markers worked and how it was replenished and utilized.  That made for some interesting choices.  however, in our five-player game you had so little control that everything changed before it got back to your own turn.  the random popping in and out of mammoths made scoring wildly unpredictable.  Surprising to see they included this in the Alea series.

I enjoyed the interesting mechanic where playing dark-side action cards helps your opponents and earns you stones.  (Stones are necessary for playing light-side action cards that exclusively help you.)  Despite the neat mechanic, I consider the game too chaotic for a player to develop any solid strategies.    Because I like the essence of the game as well as the theme, I might be persuaded to increase my rating if a skilled gamer could convince me the chaos factor can be regularly overcome by superior play.

Fun, well-themed, area control game (although I agree with sisteray's statement that it's a stock game) with a clever mechanism where one has to give their opponents "bad" (dark) cards to play against whom they choose in order to get the action points necessary to play "good" (light) cards that help yourself.  The ice age tiles didn't seem to impact the game too much since there were quite a few turns in between scoring rounds.  I would suggest house rules of having two glacier tiles played after each round.  It would make for a much tighter game (smaller board).  If you're the leader, point-wise, watch your back because you're going to be targeted.

Too chaotic. The board changes a lot between turns, and there are no clues as to what anyone will do, further chaosified by the fact that when someone plays a dark card they often have to choose an opponent to decide what happens. Add to that uncertainty of when the round will end and you get a dog reminiscent of Infinite City.

Do not want.

Decent enough game. Feels a lot like a family-weight version of Dominant Species. Has a light and dark card mechanic that would later be copied in Android, to some degree. Overall though, this game didn't do much for me. The pressing issue of having enough stones in the light pile was interesting, but I felt like the rest of the game was stuff I had already seen before. At the same time, this is a 15-year old game, and it's probably my favorite Alan Moon game next to Ticket to Ride, so there's that. I just wish you had maybe a few more opportunities to play cards before scoring happens. Plus I feel like there's a little too much take-that going on in this game for most people to tolerate it. Regardless, I feel like El Grande offers a similar feel in a much better way.

Played only once: I did not know what to expect, so I had no high expectations.  Nevertheless, playing this games has been a disappointing experience.  My major issues are the kill-the-leader syndrome and the gamelength (our 5 player game took almost 2 hours to finish).  The game does have some nice mechanics which I like (the dark and light cards and the use of mammoths), but the two mentioned issues really need fixing.  I can't help comparing Eiszeit with Clans: less control and is simpler in design and options but more rewarding with less investment.

Alea's 8th Big Box game: Area control game based on the ice age. On their turn, players either play a dark card to collect activity tokens, or play a light card to move tokens. There are 6 mammoths in the game, and an area with 1 or 2 mammoths double or triple the score, respectively. Last place player after each scoring round gets to use a glacier to wipe out an area. Some nice ideas here. However, I only got to play once, since we thought it was extremely fiddly (put a mammoth in your area, have someone take it away, put it back, moved away etc). Played with 5 people once and the game was sold.

Played twice (with 3 and 5). 5-player game is a lot better. We actually completed the full 4 rounds. (with 3, we couldn't complete the game) Still, pretty chaotic, long, and reminds me of Moon's another worst game Wonger.

First play proved quite enjoyable. I like how the last place player can close off a section and even things up. Plenty of decisions to make and enough cards in hand to balance out the luck of the draw. On the downside, what 5-year-old did they get to do the artwork? What an eyesore!

I think has been unfairly treated. There is some interesting tactical game play and nice art work. Play only three rounds and the people's concerns are dealt with, I think.

Upgraded to 7 again - even though I can never get anyone to play it, I like it, so there!

RATING: 6
The players control tribes of neolithic hunters, scoring points for thriving in different sections of the board. Mammoths add extra points. Space is tight.

There are two decks of cards: light cards cost to play, and have positive effects. Dark cards gain the resources reqired to play light cards, but their effects are controlled by another player, who will usually punish you. It is great to find a situation where your opponent has no clear reason to get you- but it never lasts.

There is a silly rule restricting table talk when playing dark cards- we ignored this restriction with no ill effects or bad feelings. But Mammoth Hunters is a very direct game with plenty of conflict, so it can be a challenge to remain civil when all the other players steal your mammoths.

RATING: 6
An area majority game with (somewhat) hidden limits on each section resulting in Civ style elimination before each of the 4 scorings. The novelty is that you must play cards that help other players to earn you enough tokens to then play the cards that help yourself. Each turn results in quite a bit of chaotic board manipulation, with massive hit-the-leader and king making ability. I originally thought it might be best with 3 as a result, but if you play it as a bit of non-serious romp, it may actually be best with more players on the more-the-merrier theory. Anyway, occasional play only.

Based on one play: The game is a little long and we decided to make it three rounds instead of four. You play light and dark cards to either benefit you or others. When playing a dark card, your opponents get a benefit, but you get stone, in order to pay for future light cards. You do not want to be in the lead or other will try and harm you, a lot and in each round ,the last few moves are the only ones that count, since you will score based on the ending positions of the hunters and mammoths. Not a terrible game, but not likely one I will ever play again.

A game in The Alea-serie I didn't have/played yet, but as it it language dependent, I waited until I could have a copy in English for a low price.

I knew in advance that the average rating of this one was low, but that for instance also the case for 'Um Ru(h)m und Ehre', which is a game I like and Weisbloom and Moon or 2 authors which have a good reputation for me personally in the family game-branch.

This game however seems to deserve his low rating. It takes quite some time to play for what it is (which is a timing game were you wanna play your powerful cards at the right time (which is when the supply of stones is low on the dark side and your opponents are also low on stones to counteract your move) and all the things you do before are insecure) and it misses fire while you're playing it. This will be for me 1 of these games that I won't mind playing of someone would ask for it, but I'll never chose it out of my 800+ games collection to be the game to play.

This is the best Moon game since Wongar. It is a relentless battle for area/points and confronts the player with tough choices on many levels; when to play light/dark cards, where to optimize piece placement, etc.  It is a great game but not for everyone as the strategies are not obvious and the play can become nasty (on the order of Risk or Vinci).

I'm a sucker for area majority games, and this is a solid if slightly unspectacular addition. Highly tactical - there's no point in trying to think too far ahead. Rewards those who manage to get their hunters into regions right at the end of the game. Otherwise, hunters rarely end up where you initially place them.

Perhaps one turn too long, though very easy to jump into. One of the simpler Alea titles.

Mammoth Hunters.  My group greatly enjoys this game.  Our games are always tense and everyone is tempted to table talk to try and sway the current player to pick them to hurt others and promise not to hurt the current player if they pick them.  It plays similer to El Grande and actually finds more plays in my group than that game.  Its definately twisted in that constantly you are picking which opponite to do somethin bad on the board, because they could mess with your hunters.  I think the luck claim is no more there than El Grande which also has tactical cards that are raandomly drawn.  Underrated game if you ask me.  Recommended.

I really like the stone mechanism of getting paid to allow bad things to happen to help you do go things.  This is a fun and interesting little game that would be a 7 or 8 if it played a little quicker.  I wonder how it would be with the three round version as opposed to the four?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Players vie for majority control in regions of prehistoric Earth before an ice age (tundra tiles placed by the last place player) approaches. Spaces with mammoths are most valuable for scoring. Hidden fire tiles adjust (randomize) the capacity of each space before conflict causes decay. What makes this game, however, is the card play: players may pay for and play light-backed cards to gain an advantage (shift, swap, or move hunters; gain clubs for conflict) or they may play dark-backed cards to gain valuable money -- however, when playing dark cards they must then choose an opponent who can take the action of such cards, thereby helping that player. Fun, unique, and Alea big box.

I am shocked by all the low ratings. This simple little game offers a wealth of options for players, and was a real hit with my group.

This is a great game that is simple enough to play with family, but with enough depth to keep it interesting.

RATING: 4
Rather chaotic (less so with fewer players), so you have to work hard on the timing of your income and what cards you play as a result. In a way it's a good thing though as no one particular action has too much of an impact... unless maybe it comes right at the end of the round... Sure there's the ganging up on the leader problem, and it's a noteworthy problem (is there some variant to counter this that I could try?), but the income mechanism in this game is so clever I rate the game quite highly anyway. I'm happy to play it, but I'll be looking to set myself up well with income and good cards in the penultimate round over taking a strong lead in the points. Three rounds also seems about right. Must break out the meeples too as those cylinders aren't very hunter looking. The game is better than I thought it would be considering the ratings it's received. Might be best with three.

This is the kind of game I like to play: chaotic, screw-thy-neighbor, and just flat out try to survive the Ice Age. The mechanism with the light and dark cards is very interesting, and provides a strong press-your-luck feel. I feel like the clubs might be underpowered, and the game length needs to be shorter to justify the chaos. Starting with fewer stones in the dark pile sounds like a good idea.

I really enjoyed this game. The game revolves around a fun mechanic. There are 2 types of cards, white and black. Initially, you start the game with no money (stones). You need money to play the white cards, which help you. The only way to get money is to give a black card to another player which they resolve immediately, helping them and potentially hurting you. So, a major mechanic of the game is managing the other players. My rating is based on a single play and could go up on repeated plays, since there's nothing I didn't like about this game.

Well, as usual, I should't listen to what any of you Prices of Florence, E&T lovers have to say.  Blah, blah, blah, Alea, blah, blah, sunshine out of my behind.  People just didn't like this because it wasn't Puerto Rico.  If HiG Amigo or Goldsieber put this out, people wouldn't be ragging it.  How many Alea droolers have played Taj Mahal, or bought Adel Verplicht or Chinatown.  Anyone that knocks this game by saying that it is El Grande lite or any kind of Area Influence game is frankly retarded -- this is a Civ rip off!!!  This doesn't divide points like El Grande it just eliminates pieces EXACTLY like Civ.  God, get it straight!  Plus this isn't Wongar either, even though you are playing on a grid, Wongar's three different types of control markers work differently from your one type of caveman, scoring is per square, and Wongar actually scores for the majority leader.   In MH everyone left alive scores per caveman. Plus, the card action seems more a great spin on the mechanics from Quatro! The only real similarity to El Grande or Wongar is that you use cards to place pieces or effect something on the board, well now no other game has EVER done that! Overall, a stock game more than area influence.  Anyway, rant over.  I like this game, it has a great sense of movement, this is really about keeping your folks on the go.  Find ways to survive the starvation and score points.  I will say four rounds seems excessive, play three with a random d4 for Glacier placement up top to speed things up.  We had a great time playing this and I can't wait to buy a copy up from some meek direct conflict fearing sap. Update: It is mine now, MINE!

Decent area control game, but nothing earth-shattering.  On the plus side, I like how you can only get stones by playing cards that help your opponents (and it's only with stones that you can advance your own cause), but it's pretty vanilla area control from that point forward.  The mammoths do look pretty cool as well, but the rest of the bits are just OK.

A nice, fun little Ice Age boardgame, that combines elements of Area Majority, Hand Management (ie cards), and (a little) Resource Management.  A couple of interesting mechanics, and awesome mammoth-meeples to boot!  Not for those wanting a detailed or highly strategic game, but still plenty going on and some hard choices to make sometimes for those who play in a more relaxed and forgiving way.  Some regard its 2-hour playing time as a bit long, and needing modification.  Playable with like-minded adults, or with kids.

A decent area majority game with a "shrinking" board. Fun,  but can seem a bit long. But...Mammoth meeples so...yeah, it's all good.

What struck me after I played this again was how similar it was to Dominant Species...while being quicker and slightly more elegant. I might be able to get this to the table more often than Dominant Species so that might make my rating climb higher.

There is a little "push your luck" element to it as no one knows what the overall number an area can hold is until after they've placed their hunters. I don't know how I feel about that yet.

Mammoth Hunters has a great mechanism where players have to pay for good cards, and get paid to let other players do stuff.  You have to pay attention to other players that should have your best interests in mind.  It seems quite chaotic as action cards force the mammoths to move around the board, rendering fights in some areas nearly useless, but not so chaotic as to be unenjoyable.

The whimsical theme of Mammoth Hunters is an appropriate match for its fluffy gameplay.  The dual decks are a brilliant mechanism for balancing selfish and selfless actions, but the game that surrounds the cards is a weak area-influence design that is too long by half.  Worse, there is a wide discrepency in the relative strengths of the cards and if you don't get an appropriate sample of them, there is no workaround.  Mammoth Hunters would have made a good filler.

This game has the fewest turns of any that I know (using our inadvertent variant).  While not that long, the game isn't a filler, though.  Trying to finesse the actions you want out of the five cards you get to play is really engaging.  It feels great when you hit your stride and finish strong.

Acquired a used copy and only played once.  Great condition, all pieces, no damage/fade/scratches. Traded away!

Played this one on the Ducosim convention in Utrecht. Liked it a lot and spoke some people that liked it too, so what's up with the low ratings so far?

I enjoy this game when a player must play a dark card and loss a mamouth. A very impredectible game. Never knows who is going to be the winner.

+ Configurations équilibrées selon le nombre de joueurs.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
® Je recommande son essai car il pourrait être apprécié par d’autres joueurs.

Un peu trop "statique" à mon goût car j'aurais préféré qu'il offre plus de configurations différentes au niveau de la progression des plaques de glaces. Cependant, il vaut la peine d’être essayé au moins une fois ne serait-ce que pour sa mécanique particulière des "roches" qui ne ressemble à aucune autre que je connais.

Great theme and solid gameplay. Underrated as a gateway game. Much better with 4 players than 3.

RATING: 7
Based on two plays.  Great design idea of light cards you pay for and dark cards that earn income, but the game feels long.  Maybe my group needs to play it more?  Leader bashing not as serious as others suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The stones are annoyingly thin, but the game is OK.  Complaints about bash the leader are correct, and should have been addressed by the designers (I mean, really, it's blatantly obvious, so why not come up with something, anything?). Wish there was a bit more variety of cards/effects/etc. 

Definitely not up to Alea standards, and interesting that this is the very obvious cliff where alea fell off, and have been struggling to get back ever since.  I guess they wanted wider appeal, so they went family-oriented with this and the next few games, but there are good games that do both.  This isn't one.

Cute box art and a cute game (and some of the best meeples avaliable in anything!) of card driven resource management and hunting mammoths (BOO!) rules are a little confusing, but the advancement of the glacier is a nice mechanic and looks good

A area majority gane that has a 'El Grande light' feel to it. The light/dark card mechanism (get money and help others, pay it to help yourself) is fun. A bit chaotic but in a good way as there is room for strategic play. I suggest playing only 3 rounds as also mentioned in the rulebook. An underrated game, probably because of its Alea logo and being released right after Puerto Rico.

Interesting mechanic with the stone supply: You have to do actions that help other players or may hurt yourself. A bit too easy to hurt the leader.

Note to self: this is "Mammoth Hunters"

RATING: 5
Needs paste-ups. This game is highly tactical and chaotic with not enough arc for me. I like that it's a simpler area majority game but it feels like on most turns you don't feel like you want to do anything in particular because it's going to be undone almost immediately.

I didn't get this game the first 2 times. It is much better after the 3rd game.

Played once (with 5 players). This game has some interesting ideas, but was not as enjoyable as I hoped it would be, because of its length and some kingmaking problems. However, I would play it again some day to give it a second chance (maybe with fewer players?).

I didn&#039;t like this game at all. It looked sketchy right out of the box. The game although very simple is too long and not varied enough to play again. There&#039;s alot of chaotic and random leader bashing. After about the 2nd round I just wanted to quit, we played the full 4 rounds.

What a shame this has been knocked so much!  I'm not the biggest Alan Moon fan, but I like what he and Aaron Weissblum have done here.  I think that there are some subtle things going on that people are missing.  This is my impression after only one play, mind you.  I am actually eager to try the game with 4 or 5, as I think it would be even more fun!

遊戲的卡牌分作深、淺兩色。玩家打出淺色卡牌，即由自己執行牌上的行動，但要支付石頭作代價。玩家打出深色卡牌，方可賺取石頭，卻會由其他玩家執行牌上的行動。玩家即要在執行行動、及賺取石頭之間，設法謀取平衡。

玩家每回合的得分，是按遊戲圖板上棋子數目計算。若玩家的棋子能與猛獁同處同一區域，即會取得更多分數。 
每個區域可養活的人數皆有上限。若某區域沒有足夠的生存空間，超出這上限的棋子將會被移走。棋子數目較少的一方，將會優先被淘汰。而每回合結束時，冰川面積會擴大，遊玩範圍即會縮細。因此玩家的棋子既要在同一區域佔數量優勢，亦要避免遭冰川所困。

完成4個回合後，遊戲結束，累積得分最多者勝。

Definitely not one of the best in the (excellent) alea-series.

Nicest map ever on this subject. Few scenarios. Where was the campaign game for this?

Excellent addition to the ATS series. You'd have to be a gaming Philistine not to appreciate the map.

RATING: 9
Arnhem is, since its release, an ATS classic. The map is standing the test of time and can still be considered one of the best in the ATS world and beyond. The ten scenarios are cool and tense, a real test of your skills in urban combat. Great game.

RATING: 9.5
My first ATS game, and ...wow!  The maps are beautiful, and the counters are big enough to see and play with.  The variety of scenarios provide a lot of action.  I am a long-time SL/ASL fan, and I have to say that ATS has really gotten more game play than ASL lately.  This has to be my favorite Arnhem game.

Superb in all accounts! Giant highly detailed map, well-researched product - cool scenarios filled with drama! We need more Kurt!

RATING: 5
Your typically ATS release: nice map, interesting scenarios, but the alternating impulse mechanic makes for a game of action-reactions instead of coordinated tactics. This fact becomes even more prominent in this streetfighting release.

RATING: 6
Interesting and rather bloody squad level tactical system.  The Advanced Tobruk System in Europe.  It&#039;s fiddly, but becomes intuitive after a while.  I couldn&#039;t get into ASL, but this I can.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite ATS titles.  Good house-to-house fighting.  BIG hexes are a great idea.  ATS is my choice for tactical battles (over ASL and LnL).  Has just the right amount of rules and plays fun and fast!

RATING: 7
A good bit different than the earlier SPI game--the map looks very similar (and so do the pieces at first glance), but gone are the artillery units.  Instead are "gunflash" pieces that represent various strengths of fires.  This introduces a bit of "bidding" to combats, adding uncertainty and excitement.  Some like it, some don't. It does add a bit of "gamey tactics" in some situations.  Your mileage may vary.

RATING: N/A
A combination of overzealous trading and forgetting to take the game off of the birthday list netted me two copies. I love ATS, but not so much that I need two copies of the same game.

This is the newer version of Arnhem - Defiant Stand--the one with two copies of the same map (compared to the original printing, which had one map with larger hexes spread over two sheets). It is complete and unpunched, but out-of-shrink and has some shelfwear and dishing on the box. It comes with version 3.08 of the rulebook.

The map alone is an experience.  The map on this game is pure art!  Worth owning this title just for the map!

ASL-loke to the point that I see no sig difference in the beginning scenarios.

RATING: 8
A very detailed and well done recreation of the fighting in the city of Arnhem during Market-Garden.
It is very well researched and the scenarios are quite tense, most of them deciding the winner in the last turn.
As most of the ATS titles, the game has all the necesary to be played (you don't need anything else) and the hexes are big!!
A "must own" for lovers of tactical wargames in general and for Arnhem lovers in particular.

Could be a 10, but I should wait until I've played a majority of scenarios a bit more.

I like the the ATS system quite a bit...a good amount of tactical detail while still remaining playable.  Theme puts this game over the top though--it has a *great* map of the Arnhem bridghead held by the Brit 1st Para Brigade.  Map has oversized hexes, too, which are perfect for all the urban fighting.  Bloody game system, fits great with the deadly urban warfare of this engagement.

Another module in the Advanced Tobruk System line from Critical Hit.  A big map of that portion of Arnhem where the Red Devils made their stand.  Out gunned and out numbered, only the Brits great morale keeps them in the fight.  My favorite of the series so far!

RATING: 7
Plays fast.  Info on charts allows one to play without constantly looking into the rules.  Player alternate impulses so there is very little down time in this game.  ATS works very well in depicting the action in Arnhem.

ATS just hasn't caught on among wargamers and the recent (2010 to 2012) changes to the system like added complexity in the rules and smaller counters make it less attractive to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great system.  This game offers an AWESOME map of Arnhem, with very nice counters to go along with it.  The scenarios are small and manageable, but are still very hotly contested affairs.  I agree with Doug Adams, it takes a little while to get the sighting and building effects down (there are a ton of sight lines in this game!) but once you get those down, the game flows very well.  I wish there were campaign rules with this game ala the Combat! Kursk and Stalingrad varieties, but Ray said he would fix that.

Arnhem on tactical level...hmmm, smells good.  At tactical level, the ferocity and merciless side of the battle cna be recreated.  You can see how an AFV actually got hit by anti-tank fire and smoked out the personnel inside...Great applicability of ATS onto this battle.

Just played twice Grabner charge scenario. Once you have ghot the basics the game flows smoothly. The scenarios are well tought and fun and I "feel2 The cababilities of the different weapons system. I have played with the optional turn sequance and the experience is very, very chaotic. My wallet and my mom have to be scared by ATS...

RATING: 3
Simple and fast WWII game. Ideal if you like fun games with big bunch of hasard and if lack of realicism doesn't trouble you too much.

Vehicles rules are simples and fun and I particulary like the interactions between guns, vehicles and infantry, which are simple and well managed. As an AFV game, it's perfect. The big problem is about infantery rules. The system make frontals assaults very safe in ATS : big human waves will suffer only very poor losses and the best tactic is often to create big stacks and to make some frontal assault. It's really the biggest caveat in that game since it's in total contradiction with datas extracted from real military experience.
Some others details like smoke providing better cover than bunkers and the big part of hasard when firing make infantry rules a bit stranges. If there were infantry rules only, that game would deserve a 3.

Rules are rather clear and simple but are 60 pages long. The Critical Hit forum will give you some friendly support to help you understanding them.

When purchasing a game, you also have a whole stand alone game with no need to buy some others components. It's a very good thing ! However, the client support is one of the worst I know and if you command directly a game and you leave in Europe, you'll often have to wait 2 months or more to receive your game. If you buy game directly on your game shop, beware that you can have obsoletes rules. You still can download the newer on Critical Hit site, but you can't download the new charts/tables...

Conclusion : it could have been a good game with some good ideas. But some  important caveats (and sometimes a bunch of amateurism) make it a very disappointing WWII game.

Looking for 2nd Edition - has two maps, identical with "standard" sized hexes.  Already own 1st edition - two maps forming Arnhem with "big" hexes.

The extra large hexes make for a large map, but also much less counter clutter. Makes this edition attractive even to the ASL player (don't believe the larger hex version was released to ASLComp side).

ATS is the tactical system that I have always wanted. It's detailed, but not overwhelmingly so. (I never got into ASL because I have limited gaming time and like to play a variety of games). The game is very interactive and plays well both solitaire and FTF. The components are top-notch and the many scenarios range from short infantry or armor only clashes to lengthy combined-arms ones. The game system works just as well in a dense urban environment as it does in the desert. ATS provides an excellent narrative and gives good tactical insight. It's interesting to see the differences in weapons systems and how they (along with terrain) shape the battlefield. Be sure to get the most recent rules & charts!

I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this system to anyone interested in a detailed squad based WWII game.  A friend of mine who has played a lot of Squad Leader took to the game very quickly.  Others completely new to the genre were a little overwhelmed by the detail.

I have played most of the Arnhem scenarios a couple of times.  Some are definitely better than others.  A couple of the scenarios leave you scratching your head wondering if the Brits actually have a chance to win.

Although this doesn't effect the game rating, my customer service experience with Critical Hit was by far the worst I've ever had with a game company.  Not enough to make me stop buying their products which is lucky for them.

RATING: 8.5
The 10 scenarios provided make for a fun game when time is short.  The map of Arnhem is one of the better ones out there.  The system can be played with basic rules or add on the details as you like.  Solitaire plays very well.  Frost vs. Grabner in a tactical Smack Down for the Bridge is my favorite scenario: &quot;Grabner&#039;s Charge.&quot;  The Oosterbeck expansion pack is to be had as well.

ATS goes to Arnhem. As I love this system it's always a pleasure to play it on a new map. Nice scenarios that capture well the dramatic situation, nevertheless this game would really deserve a campaign system "à la" Berlin.
Please, please, please, give us a campaign system for this module.

Nice game - bought for large hex map but not included. Parts missing. CH response very poor and cynical representative unhelpful...this customer treated as third rate dummy. If Large hex maps in 3rd Bridge for ASL why not ATS ? Fortunately the bad taste from company rep washed out by gaming experience.
Recommend for experienced gamers prepared to overlook quality issues.

RATING: 10
I noticed that a couple of guys came here and gave this game a '1' rating. I suspect strongly they, ahem, support another 'system' and need to get a life -- to provide such a rating, with no comments, makes it clear these people don't even own the game. Can you say, 'weasel'...I knew you could.

This is a great game, the map is awesome, accurate, and the game pieces are large and readable, not to mention very detailed. The two maps are two foot by three foot, large for any gaming table, but many of the scenarios can be played on one map or the other.

Best box in wargaming, solid. Best counters of any tactical level game, 5/8" squads, 3/4" tanks and guns (yes, I said THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH!). The tank drawings are overheads, and spot on. The company supports the system with downloadable rules updates. They have an awesome (and may I say FRIENDLY AND MATURE) message board of their own that has over ONE THOUSAND system enthusiasts posting daily.

This is a must have game I'm glad I OWN (unlike those '1' phonies), have played through and through, and would suggest to anyone.

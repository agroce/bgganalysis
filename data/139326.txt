RATING: 4
This is a mixed bag. Trick taking is fun, but somehow I felt that in UGO all strings of control slipped through your hands. The art on the board and face side of the cards is nice, but the king on the box and back side of the cards was really horrible - even to the extent that it disturbed me during the game.

Ugo is a real family card game. Easy to learn fun to play. Luck is involved but tactic is also very important. Very nice to play with children.

RATING: 7
On early acquaintance I rather like Ugo.  It is tough for a new trick taker to make an impression, there have been so many, but Ugo gives the old genre some intriguing twists. There are five suits (card values 0-8).  You want to win tricks with high value cards.  However, you also need farmers, who are gained by winning tricks with lower value cards or by playing very low value cards.  Win cards in more colours than you have farmers to support and there will be hefty penalties.  There is also fun to be had in donating new colours and low value cards to the winner of the trick.  Juggling those elements is enjoyable.

Ugo's cards, board and box are all well produced.  the rules are reasonably well written.  The artwork gives the misleading impression that this is a children's game.

RATING: 6
The game is better than the rating than I've given it but for one epic failure in the rules, which spoiled it so badly for our group that we've decided that we'll only play it again with a house rule to correct this problem.  

The game is largely luck driven and it's possible to draw a hand which makes it impossible to avoid a huge negative score, no matter how you play it - which effectively eliminates that player from the game.  

A very simple house rule fixes the issue - but ratings shouldn't be based on how they are after you've improved the flaws with house rules.

An expanded version of Whist, Hugo creates amusing moments of drama as the unwilling player is brought to win a hand that he didn't want to and is thus robbed of a score of points or two.

Hugo sits in the twilight zone between an overgrown filler and a ultralight card game: anyhow, it might be worth even a 7.

RATING: 7
Interesting take on trick-taking, where messing with other players scores is as satisfying as building up your own. Each type of hand needs to be played differently, and that should keep repeat players interested for quite some time. 

Make sure you play this with 4 players only, if they are gamers. For lower player counts, it's just a luck fest. Quite appropriate for families, as it is short and easy to teach. Nice for what it is. 

Rating is for 4 players.

RATING: 4
UGO! is a trick-taking game, with the nasty twist that the cards from a trick you won have to be distributed over a tiny playing board, and that the cards on top of each stack of suits determine your score. If you won a trick with a valuable '8' in it, you can find yourself getting stuck with a worthless '1', which has to cover the 8... and screwing you out of 7 points. In addition, not all stacks automatically yield points as you have to 'activate' them to some extent. Have a stack on an unactivated space? Tough luck: here's a hefty malus.

I have very little love for trick-takers, and could not really appreciate this one either. I think I prefer them when the special things they do are kept as simple as possible, like for example in The Bottle Imp. Also, the fact that prior to each game a random subset of cards is set aside from the main deck means that you cannot rely on what is the highest or lowest card in a suit anymore. It was probably done to prevent AP and excessive computation... but in a game where playing low cards can be a decisive weapon the lack feels out of place.

Not a bad game, I think, but one I do not plan on playing again anytime soon.

J'ai essayé de lire les règles durant une perm. Trop d'affluence au bar, j'ai pas tout compris. Mais ça a l'air simple quand même. Grosso modo, ça à l'air d'être un jeu de pli, une sorte de bataille où il va falloir conquérir des territoires à partir de cartes numérotées. Ah oui, il y a des paysans qui ont l'air plutôt importants. Et puis le personnage sur la boîte me fait penser à un perso animé (les oreilles en moins) de la télévision. Vous savez, une sorte de jeu télévisé animé par Karen Chery en 1992. Quoi, vous ne connaissez pas ? Le coup de vieux que je prends !

A trick taking game with some great twists.  You want to win tricks but at the end of the round you only score the most recently won trick in each colour. And colours only score if you have collected enough Farmers along the way.  Certain cards, usually the lower ones, yield farmers.  So you are trying to win large numbered cards toward the end of the round, whilst winning farmers to ensure the tricks score.  It makes for a really good game and a terrific addition to the trick-taking genre.

This is a brilliant filler. A lot of interaction going on, as well. I love games where you can exploit your cards, independent of their values. This is such a game. I don't say that there are no luck/unluck involved, because there is, since you don't know what cards other players will play. But you can definitely do "smart moves" in this game. I highly recommend this game. It seems that this game has gone "under the radar". Strange.

This trick-taker requires you to think hard about which tricks you actually want to win and which you rather wouldn't. Granted, even if you decide you don't want a particular trick that doesn't mean that you won't get it regardless. In fact, it is often in the best interest of your fellow players to let you get exactly those tricks you don't want.

There are certainly trick-takers that work with similar scoring systems and aren't quite as luck-heavy as Ugo but there are few that play as quickly and can be explained in a minute.

UGO! is a great take on trick-takers that I haven't seen before.  I love how winning tricks isn't just what this is all about.  It's really about collecting farmers and placing your won tricks at the right place at the right time.  But good luck!  Your opponents can really mess you over if the cards don't play out your way.  It's a bunch of fun though and definitely bumps itself up into my favorite trick-takers of all time.

I'd have no qualms playing this trick taker again but I probably won't seek it out.  There is a fair bit of luck in the game in the card draw which hopefully evens out over several rounds.  While you must follow suit if you can, if you can play out of suit it can be advantageous in either giving opponents negative points, reducing their score in a color, and/or grant you farmers which help prevent negative suits.  Another odd piece to this trick taker is the highest value card wins the trick (ties go to color led and then around from whomever led the trick).

RATING: 5
 It's a trick-taking game. One that has a board, because there's a sort of set collection angle added to it, making your choices even tougher. In the hands of some skilled players, this could be a mean little game, which all good trick-taking games should be.

Way too easy to get the farmers: we messed up a rule that ended up being a lot more interesting, in that any half full region would count minus five points.  Because there are so many cards missing from the dealt out cards, you cannot really make a strategy.  Not a very good game, I am afraid.

Nice twist on trick-taking - games. However, as, especially with less then 4 players, a great part of the cards are not participating, you're enable to count the cards, as you don't have a clue if they are still in someone's hands or just not dealt? So the dose of luck in this game is greater then in for example 'Sticheln'.

UGO! is yet another tricktaker with a twist. I liked it, but man is it overproduced for what it offers, with a huge box, individual player boards and tokens. The main twist here is that timing when you win tricks is really important - usually you want to win with your high cards late but not too late. And there's a clever way of balancing the power of low cards vs high cards too.

I played this trick taking game at Spiel 2013, helped by one of the three designers Thomas Jansen. It is nice to hear how the development of the game went, by three persons, in three stages.

If you win the trick you will add the cards to your scoreboard, sorted by color and you have to add the cards on top of the cards of the same color you collected in earlier turns. The last card on top determines your score. Besides this you also have to collect farmers to avoid penalty points. The winning card determines the number of farmes you might earn and as you might already guessed, the higher the number of the card, the lower number of farmers you will get.
Nice game what played a lot better with three than two when we started. The game has a great production value. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Trick taking game in which strong cards are liabilities and weak cards are a blessing and can be used to attack other players.

Every time a player wins a trick, he or she sorts the cards won in the trick and places each card in one of five piles, each pile consisting of cards of one suit. Final score is the sum of upper-most cards of each pile. Of course, players cannot rearrange cards in their piles, so opponents will try to force you to win low valued cards.

High cards are a liability because players score another type of points in the game, farmers. Each card has a number of farmers on them, from zero to two. Higher cards have less farmers than lower ones. When a player wins a trick, he or she wins the number of farmers indicated on the card that won the trick.

The game requires players to do contradictory things: Win tricks with high cards (as these give maximum points), win tricks with middling numbers (as these give farmers), win tricks that contain a minimum number of colours (the more colours of cards you collect in tricks, the more farmers you must win or else lose points). So what's interesting in this game is that every card is powerful if played at the right time.

The game is way, way, way overproduced. The individual playing boards are unnecessary and the box is three times way too big.

Although it's an intriguing game, it doesn't have that addictive quality like Tarot, Belote, Mue, Cosmic Eidex or any other traditional card game. I think it's because with these classic games, you have the added benefit of partnerships and more varied goals, i.e. trying to max out an incredibly powerful hand or trying to survive a crappy hand. In this game, almost every hand is playable.

I definitely have to play this again soon. One advantage of this one is that it's very accessible. The rules are simple and the luck factor is big enough not to discourage those who don't do well with trick taking games.

Jogo muito diferente do habitual mas ao mesmo tempo muito parecido... Diferente na forma de pontuar e por ter uns tabuleiros extra e micro chips, mesmo micro! Igual por a mecânica ser já muito vista; tem um pouco de Stichln, de Wizard e até dos tradicionais jogos de cartas. Devia de incluir forma de contar pontos, nisso fica abaixo de alguns outros jogos de cartas, que regra geral são bem mais baratos, como "Poison", "Arboretum", "Wizard", não precisam da comum folha de papel reutilizada...

Played once with 4P. One of the simplest trick-taking games I've played, partially because you can't really count cards (5 cards are randomly left out in a 4P game).

The scoring of the card currently on top of each suit, as well as the need for farmer tokens as different suits are collected requires players to be careful of what values and suits they win in tricks. It's a subtle twist, but very clever. However, it also seems like a balanced hand of high and low values has a distinct advantage, but I might be wrong.

Overproduced (boards, big box) trick-taking game with some weird twists. Highest number wins, regardless of suit, but only the most recently acquired card in a suit can score. Moreover, acquiring too many suits results in very hefty penalties unless enough farmer tokens have been collected (via winning tricks with low cards or by losing tricks with 1s or 2s).

The problem is the lack of control. Too many cards are removed for counting to work, and there's really no way to guard against a short-suited player doing damage to you. Targeted attacks are likewise difficult because being short the led suit doesn't guarantee a loss.

I don't understand the relatively high ratings.

RATING: 6.2
For me [thing=354][/thing] is the best trick taking game I have ever played. It is also an atypical one. UGO! is more of a standard kind of one. Follow suit if you can, highest card wins. The twist in this one - every trick taking game needs a twist I guess - is that you place cards on a board per suit and the top card of each suit - not necessarily the highest, just the last one - is the score for that suit. And you get minus points if you have cards in lots of suits but not enough farmers, which you own by winning tricks with certain cards.
All in all a pretty standard and not too exiting game.

Initial score: 6.2

Juego casi abstracto de mover meplees y colocar piezas de vallas que encierren una zona, en tablero hexagonado, a puntuar el que mayor numero de meplees tenga dentro. Máximo 3 tipos de terreno distintos puntúan cuando se cierran. Sencillo de explicar pero no de dominar, muy entretenido. Un tanto caótico cuantos más jugadores.

Area control by meeple movement.  End game is very interesting - careful choices to make, lots to consider, very score-oriented.  Start game is not - very wild, tons of options but with limited foresight, hard to be score-oriented.  Though the game becomes more interesting as it plays out, it's difficult to effect strategies until the end when area completion and control become more apparent.

Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of it.  It seemed too simple.  For the most part, what you do doesn't seem to matter too much.  What your opponent does matters a ton though.  That's not to say that if they play well they'll win, they'll just be able to screw you over more effectively.

RATING: 4
kinda brutal how badly this one played in my first and only experience with 2P.  simple rules, nice box, decent production, and i'm always strangely interested in these type of hex and territory looking games.  the play was pretty pedestrian, though, and mostly featured scoring standoffs with piles of meeples.  i'll concede that this could entirely be a play style thing, but if only one player does it they can force it to be that kind of game.  another one that seems better-suited for exploration as a play-by-web game because of the potential AP.

An abstract with a thin exploration theme, surround an area with markers and the majority in that area gets points, etc. etc. etc. Simple, inoffensive, but not a must-play by any means.

This is really an abstract game and plays best when played with 2 and as an abstract.  The goal of the game is to score maximum points which is done by enclosing landscape regions and having the dominate number of figures in it when it closes.  The less landscape types - the more points.  The more spaces in the area - the more points.  With more than 2, the game can feel a bit more chaotic then desired.  Game can be prone to Analysis Paralysis - so time the game time carefully.  [GTI: AGSD]

Quite interesting abstract that reminds to "Penguins" because of the movement of the pawns around the board.  It is about creating sorrounded areas and controlling them, so it should play quite differently with different number of players.  With 4, might be a bit chaotic but in the good sense.  The game allows you to make nice nasty movements.  Nice materials, I have always found it very cheap in stores.  Worth playing.

Got it as a door prize.  Makes a good two player game.  As some have noted, the initial placement can be abused by one of the players to finish the game before the other can notice, but other than that the mechanics are strong.  No dice rolling for a pure strategic experience.

An annoying area-control game with poor mechanics, Terranova just drags itself from the start to the end: there’s nothing fun or exciting to do here, just placing random wooden bits while performing random moves according to random illogical rules.

It was introduced to my group as an alternative to Clans but the latter, however limited, is still way better than Terranova.

I've decided that I don't like games in which you're trying to cordon off an area of the board. That's what this is all about (so are Through the Desert, Cathedral, Deluxe Camping, and to a smaller extent Hey! That's My Fish--to all of which I've given a pretty low rating). I'm also not big on tactical versus strategic. However, the end part of this game was pretty exciting, as the area left to control gets smaller and smaller. That was pretty good, which is why I gave it a 5 instead of something even lower.

Brilliant game. With 2 players it is a tremendous brain burner, and highly competitive. With 3+ players there is always a chaos factor in games of this sort, but that makes it a bit more family friendly. Simple as can be and with almost endless depth. Don't be fooled by the theme, though --Terra Nova is as abstract as they come.

I'd rather teach and play Clans over this one.  Area control abstracts are very confrontational.  At least Clans pretty much keeps the player's identities hidden.  This game has too many opportunities for competitive play against the WRONG players (attack the leader... not me, in last place!)

[21/8/06] A textbook example for a brain-burner. With the wrong crowd, analysis paralysis is the name of the game (incidentally a player problem, not a design issue).

Coupled with a thinly pasted on theme and rather mathy gameplay, Terra Nova offers little in ways of excitement and just isn't my kinda fun.

No doubt this is a well-executed design and will appeal to those into such games. But personally I much prefer playing 'Durch die Wüste' over this barebones, calculational and essentially abstract game.

Area control with a unique twist of "worker" placemnet, whereby your worker's dictate not only your score, but where you can place your borders.  One of only a few abstracts that I actually like, but since both my wife and my daughter do not like it, it will never get played again.

There are some games that I get excited about before I buy or play them. This was not one of those games. I got it in a trade with Oregon for Power Grid. I had no real enthusiasm for it except for the some scattered praise from some geekbuddies. I played it once and was surprised. Each additional play has only strengthened my opinion that Terra Nova is one of the best multiplayer abstracts out there.

If you don’t believe it is an abstract, just look at garygarrison’s homebrew version. Comparisons to Hey That’s My Fish! Are apt, but several aspects make it a richer game with a lot more opportunity for creative – and very aggressive – play: First, the variability of the hex scoring generates opporutunity for spoilage – both by placing stones to minimize scoring through occupancy as well as through the enclosure of low-value areas. Second, the shared scoring create a more meaningful palette for parasitic play and alliance building. Moves can be offers – friendly or extortive. This is what makes it so extraordinary as a multiplayer game. While it is a fine game with two, it is just another good abstract. With three, it’s unique qualities are on display. Managing turn order is critical, challenging, and satisfying.

The setup is a mixed blessing. With so many pieces, there is a lot of opportunity to build a position before the first ‘moves’. On the downside, this can be a very daunting process for the novice and it usually devolves into a random setup. A beginner setup would be a great addition.

The quantity of pieces is necessary, though, to turn what would otherwise be a tactical brawl where ply analysis is the key question to a strategic game of space and positional possibilities. The ability to manage pressure points – liabilities and strengths – on a broad playing field is critical to setting this game apart. Being able to shift the focus and tempo – the shape of the game – is one of its glories.
---
Old comments:
With three players, this might be a 9. A classical feeling abstract that plays better multi-player than with two. The third player adds an element of tacit negotiation that is a very welcome addition to the classical ply analysis.

The board is so wide open at the beginning that there is a very broad and ambiguous strategic palette; local struggles flair up, but you can mess with tempo by shifting the focus - particularly with three players where two players instanteously and temporarily colluding.

The end-game can be a very touchy affair where folks can make use of three-territory rule to force low-value enclosures.

Attack and defense are not obvious in their execution. Plans can get turned inside out in a heartbeat. Not that there is chaos, just a lot of room for tactical creativity.

Best with three.  Don't even bother with four.  Pleasantly meaty for such a simple presentation.  The comparisons with Through The Desert and Hey! That's My Fish! are valid, but the intersection is valid and interesting in its own right.

Terra Nova is a fun game of area encirclement in the spirit of Go and Through The Desert. That is not to say that these games are absolutely identical, but they share certain elements which cause resemblence nerves to fire. The encirclement in this game is handled by little meeples walking over a rather pretty map and then dropping stones in their immediate vicinity. Players must be careful in not setting up 'easy areas' for other players, something which seems to be causing me no end of trouble, and drawing cackles of maniacal glee from my girlfriend. She complains that I always beat her in this type of game, but here she finally has a title where she [i]can[/i] win. Adding insult to injury: I have no idea why I make such stupid moves. I probably need to do a few small [i]joseki[/i] on my own to see how I should move and not move.

The game is not completely about area encirclement: you must take into account the point totals for the encircled areas. If you don't, you will lose. This isn't difficult, and once you get the hang of it, Terra Nova is compelling and clever, and, not entirely unimportant, delightfully simple with nice bits and artwork. The game stayed a bit underneath the radar even when it came out during Spiel 2006, something I don't think the game deserves. It may not be stellar, but I can certainly think of a whole lot of other titles I'd rather pass up on.

I like abstracts more than most so this one hit home.  This feels like it belongs in the old Goldsieber abstract trilogy, but it's better luckily.  
I've played it twice, once 2p and once 3p.  Both games came down to the end and resulted in quite a bit of tension.  The game is tough for me in that sometimes I think of a territory and then don't realize someone can split it, taking the juicy part of it, or that they can make a bigger one, taking the entire area from me.  That's the hallmark of a good game for me - one that makes me think.  The one downside is that like most abstracts, the potential for analysis paralysis is great.

This may be one of those "either you get it or you don't" games. A good friend, who excels at many games, despises this one and has no clue how to play it. I, on the other hand, enjoy it, although things really don't get interesting until about halfway through. You cannot assume that you are in control of a territory until it is completely enclosed; it's too easy for an opponent either to add an additional terrain type or to maneuver his pawns into the territory.

Perfect information abstract game disguised as a Euro. It's a real brain burner at first, but things sort themselves out by the end.

With so many pieces on the board to deal with at the beginning of the game, the AP-prone could trigger another "episode".

I've only played 2-player. I'm a little afraid of how out of control the game would get with more players.

Paul has been asking me to try this for a while. He's a fan of Terra Nova and has played a lot, so easily gave me a pasting, but I was surprised at how the game worked out. I thought I had the hang of it and Paul made a couple of moves and cut me out. I'd like it a little shorter, the end game was pointless, but the analogy between Terra Nova and Hey! That's My Fish! is good. But HTMF has a tight finish and you don't know the winner until the count up. Terra Nova has good graphics, although I did confuse the two forests.

Played 1 time with 2 players. This game is for the hardcore! The rules are very simple to get into, and the gameplay, though somewhat abstract, is highly tactical, and quite clever. The board is a hex grid, and you move your pioneers like you would as a rook, only with 6 directions to choose from instead of 4 (obviously.) You have 3 actions per turn, (either move, or place a border stone), and the first action must always be a move, and you may only place a border stone adjacent to a pioneer you have moved this turn.  The object: place stones in such a way as to seal territory with your pioneers having a majority within in. Less variety of terrain increases the multiplier. If that sounds great to you, you'll love this game, because it really is that simple. I think this game would be much better with 3 players than 2, but even with 2, I give this one a 7.

Terra Nova is an abstract with simple rules, yet not that easy to master. It also doesn't really look like an abstract which might make it easier to get people to play (at least for the first time). Gameplay is fine, but I'm not quite sure about long-term viability. In particular, I have similar concerns to Hey, that's my fish about kingmaking issues, especially at higher player counts.

Played this yesterday after having played 'through the desert'. I like ttd a lot, but this really got me more excited. A bit of the positioning like in ttd, but with movement, like in 'hey tha'ts my fish', added.
And the scoring (higher points with less terrain types) makes for terriffic placing and movement decissions.

I played it one time before (maybe five years ago), bought it two years ago, but had not played it again until now. I will play it very soon again!

The best way I can describe Terra Nova is that it's like a more convoluted Hey! That's My Fish!  (It also has echoes of Through the Desert and Clans.)  It's the sort of abstract strategy game that boggles my mind - but in a good way.  I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing during the early stages of the game, then the situation clarifies as the board develops.  Games like YINSH and DVONN follow a similar pattern for me - early cluelessness, but I eventually see what's happening.

I've only played Terra Nova couple times so far, but I think this is the sort of game that will get better with familiarity.

RATING: 6.5
The game is one of maneuver, as players attempt to position their pioneers in key locations and place border stones to block the movement of their opponents.  Timing is also critical, as waiting too long to close a territory can allow a wily opponent to sneak in and grab control or share the territory, while closing a territory too early reduces the number of pioneers available for future turns.  The type of thinking involved is similar to that used in many abstract games; indeed, in spite of the theme and colorful board, the game is decidedly abstract in nature.

With a full compliment of four players, the game can be a bit chaotic, as the board changes dramatically between turns and plans are difficult to achieve.  With two players, the game offers more control, and is more strategic in nature.  Some have found the game a bit too abstract and chaotic for their tastes, but I find it quite challenging, with ample opportunity for clever moves.  Terra Nova is the third release from Immortal Eyes, and in my opinion it is clearly the best.

Aug08: The Immortal Eyes guys treated us so nice at GenCon I had to go give them some of my money. After trying the game however, I have my reservations. Very abstract with tons of possible moves each turn. And very hard to see the deep ramifications of your turns. So a hard brain burn without much apparent control. Makes for a funky combination that isn't entirely enjoyable. It just doesn't have the same touch as the pastel camels. I'll try it another time or two however.

This is a neat abstract strategy game.  It can be a bit of a brain-burner, but it's not so bad. One warning though: this game can get really nasty. As the territory gets closed in, it's pretty much inevitable that the players are going to be interfering with each other. Needless to say, then, that the best strategy appears to be taking as much as you can for yourself while blocking or stealing anything built by your opponent.

Yes, there's the possibility of the annoying strategy of pooling all of your meeples in one corner and closing them off to win the game, but I think that it should be pretty easy to recognize and block such a strategy right away. Just use your own meeples to encircle them, preventing them from building any fences and voila, it should be blocked (and pretty much guarantees you the win, since most of their meeples will be tied up). I think, at least. We've agreed to not even bother playing that way since it's lame.

It's definitely worth the 10 euros I spent on it: the components are high quality and the game is fun to play. I don't know how often I'll get it to the table due to the aggressiveness of the play, but I still would wholeheartedly recommend it, at least for two players.

Terra Nova plays like a complex variant of Hey that's my fish. It needs more preparation to encircle areas and up to 13 meeples in the two-player game provide for an enhanced abstract but also AP prone challenge. For two players I prefer HTMF but Terra Nova seems like a better choice for three players when the point sharing mechanism will enter play. With four players both games lose most of their appeal as they become too chaotic.

LIKE:

* The pieces are quite tactile and pleasant to fiddle with as you play the game.  
* There is a fair bit of tension as you try to move your guys around and fence off territory to score as many points as possible.
* There is quite a bit of blocking that goes on and crafty placement of meeples and walls making this a much more crafty game than one would think with the simple ruleset. 

DISLIKE:

* There is potential for a fair bit of AP in this one as you try to consider your best move.

Terra Nova "claim as much of the new world as possible for your liege" abstract area control
[board; 80 border stones; 44 pioneers: 13 red & yellow, 10 blue & 8 green; 4 scoring markers]
> place all pioneers one/time across eight landscapes (one/hex incl. lakes)
> 3 actions/turn: 1st = move pioneer in a straight line to any space w/o jumping; pass if unable
2nd/3rd (if able) = move different or same pioneer (not back to original position)
2nd/3rd (if able) = place border stone on empty space adjacent to just-moved pioneer
> score territory immediately when 3/2/1 landscapes enclosed = # spaces x1/x2/x3 points for player with most pioneers (ties divide points rounded down); remove enclosed pioneers
> game ends when island divided into territories, only one player can move or one player's supply of pioneers depleted
> most points wins

Have played 2, 3 and 4 player games all of which play considerably different. 2 player has more of a chess like quality - you can decide to either try to foil the other's move(s) or execute your own.

Not really my thing. Perfectly fine game but I'm not an abstract gamer.

My wife does NOT like this game; says it feels too "chessy".  In a style similar to "Hey! That's my fish!", put all your guys on the board and then make little jockeying moves trying to wall off territory for points.  Really is an abstract battle of finding the soft spots in your opponents strategy.

My wife doesn't like the feeling that every move she makes might get immediately exploited.  I would expect experienced players would mop up newbies.

RATING: 7
Initial impression (after a single 2-player game) is quite good.  A quick read of the very short rules and we were up and running.  There's no hidden information and with the movement/placement rules you're kind of forced to show your strategy before you can complete a scoring move.  Right now I'm assuming that the frustration will become beautifully brutal with more plays rather than annoyingly so.

~~~~~~~~

Have now played with three, and I prefer the two-player experience.  More than two makes it nearly impossible to predict what changes will occur between your turns.

The game seems to be derived from Amazons, which I didn't like at all, so... Two-player game is dry and abstract, four-player game is a bit too chaotic. Not fun, that is. Three players is probably the sweet spot: less chaos, but the point-sharing mechanism makes some sense. However, my eagerness to try it is fairly small.

Avoid.

I worry that the critics are correct about  [thread=299609]this game being "broken."[/thread] No, setting up in a corner is not a guarantee for victory and in fact can be stopped by another player surrounding you. However, the strategy is strong enough that the game devolves into who can secure/surround a corner first and, in so doing, set the remainder of the game up into one or more quick suicides. It feels a bit like an elaborate game of tic-tac-toe, which didn't stop us from playing Gobblet, but doesn't scream "keeper" either.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This was basically an abstract area majority game that I knew nothing about going in. Terra Nova ended up being a fun experience; extremely easy rule set belies a game with a lot of choice. You are definitely trying to maximize your three actions each turn as you try and shut people out of the areas you are trying to enclose. It is important to use both the fences and your own meeples to block people, figuring out that spacial puzzle is the whole game so if that doesn't appeal to you stay away. 

I much prefer Barony if I want to play a somewhat abstract area majority game since it adds a bit more to the experience while still being easy to teach. However; Terra Nova played quick enough that I'd be happy to play again, especially as we wait for other folks to show up at our meet up.[/i]

RATING: 7
Interesting game, but it's very prone to AP. The dragged out gametime will limit its opportunities to come out because it feels like it should be a light Euro in the same way that Hey That's My Fish is (it uses the same movement mechanism, hence the parallel), but then goes well into medium Euro territory but without the weight of interacting mechanisms you expect in that niche. It's also reminiscent of the simplicity and multi-race challenge that Through The Desert provides. You have a bunch of guys on the board and each turn you move a guy. Then your final two actions can be to do other moves or place stones next to a guy you've moved. The stones will eventually carve off territories, and your aim is to control things through stone placement and blocking with your peeps so that when a territory is finally closed off, you have the most guys in that territory (as only the winner, or tied winners, score). While trying to make your territory big (each space scores a point), limiting it so that there's just 1 or 2 terrain types within that territory gives multipliers of 3x and 2x respectively, so small can be good as well. Any more than 4 terrains inside a territory and it's not considered closed off. The problem is after the halfway mark that it's easy to close off territories in all sorts of ways and it's tricky to see if you do this, can someone do something smart and interesting to close things off in a completely different way to what you can see and to what you're working towards. A couple of unexpected moves when it's not your turn can result in surprising swings in fortune that can take the game away from you. And create a bunch a AP. Apart from this issue, it's a quite interesting game of mini-moves working towards creating position and dominance.

Based on one play: Simply move your meeples around and place walls to create closed off sections that score. The player with the most meeples in the closed off area gets the points, otherwise they are split and you want to enclose one set of terrain. Simple but there are better games, maybe too simple to be worth a play as it is one of those games where you have limited impact so you hope the others don't notice your plans.

A game where you want to build borders to enclose yourself in the largest areas as possible where you have the majority of settlers, using the fewest pioneers, and making territories containing the fewest number of different terrains. It works quite well, and certainly has some complexity, but in many ways it is merely an abstract game, lacking the sort of richness and flavor to be sufficiently satisfying.

Cf with 'This town ain't big enough for the 2-4 of us'.

Played a couple times at Essen 2006 and enjoyed it.  And again in Essen 2007.  No chance or hidden information, but it didn't feel that way, interestingly.  Interesting endgame tactical subtleties can cause big swings.  I like playing green in games, so I'm annoyed that they do the pseudo-clever cheap thing of giving fewer number of player pieces of some colors, so that green is only usable in a 4-player game, and not in 2-player which is how I usually play games. But a guy at Essen gave me the necessary extra green dudes, hurray.

This is a great area majority game were you determine the regions and their value as you close them off throughout the game (ala Mexica).  There are some wonderful decisions to be made from movement and types of movement.  This plays quick and the multitude of decisions to be made keeps this game exciting to the end.  There are many tough choices as you want to win areas, but you don't want all your guys trapped.  I like to think of this as a Gerrymandering game. I suspect that the game may be served better with secret scoring or laying down your dudes to score them at the end just to keep the tension.

This is an abstract area control game with a very thinly pasted on theme: The board is a hex grid of several (6?) different hex types. Players seed the board Settlers-style with their control markers. On your turn you get 3 actions. The first MUST be to move a piece if possible - they move like chess queens. Actions 2 and 3 you may either move a piece or place a boundary stone; the boundary stone is placed in a hex adjacent to the piece which just moved (when moving markers, they may never jump over stones). An area is considered closed when it is bounded by a line of stones and/or the edge of the board, and there are 3 or fewer hex-types in it. When an area closes, you score: the area is worth points = #hexes x 3 / #hex-types. The player with the most markers takes all the points; tied players split the points; everyone else scores nothing. The control markers in that area are removed from the game. Keep playing till entire board has been scored or till no one can move markers.

This has a Through the Desert feel, I think (it's been years since I've played that game) - but the rules have been simplified like Hey! That's My Fish! There is definitely the possibility for some analysis paralyis, but still this is a very nice implementation of the area-enclosure/control mechanism.  A 6/10 for now, mostly because I like themed games better than abstracts; but this could easily go up to a 7.

Spend action points to move prospectors and lay boundary stones to seal of territory, scoring points for size and land composition if you have a majority inside it. The action points and movement rules are just enough to make it impossible to keep a determined opponent out of an area in the early game, but also impossible to prevent the sealing of an area in the late. This is a superb, vicious little brainburner.

I think best with two. House-ruling is probably necessary if someone wants to play the degenerate strategy of starting all meeples in a clump in the corner.

[gameid=20022] is an abstract game simulating settlers competing over new land, new pastures. The rules are simple and so are the components, but they are functional.

Each game begins with players placing markers (or workers). Then gameplay continues with each player having 3 actions, the first action being to move a marker. Markers move much like the bishop in chess. Once a marker has been moved it is possible to place a fence in any adjacent, unoccupied spot. The second and third actions can thus be placing a fence (or two) or moving additional markers.

Once an area has been enclosed with a maximum of 3 different terrain types it is scored. A majority of markers wins an area for that particular player. The fewer types of terrain, the more valuable the area is.

I have come to realise that abstracts do not work particularly well for us. That said, I have enjoyed the few games we have played. It requires a great deal of forethought and planning. It requires that you can see the whole board and what you and your opponents can do. It is a mental exercise that albeit interesting does not lend itself to telling tales. We have never played a game and afterwards recounted our exploits... it is just not that type of game - and therefore it has been sold.

 I think it's a really good 2 player game with an excellent screwage factor.  It is as much of an abstract as I would ever own, but at least the board and possible theme are something I can enjoy.  Well done.

I've only played two players, and as such its not a bad little abstract (better than Hey! That's My Fish). Its probably ok with 3, but I'm not sure I'd care for it with 4. 

Quibbles: Scoring track is only even numbers, but no clearly marked space for odd scores. There are only enough of certain colors for 3 and 4 player games - ie if you want to play with green, you HAVE to play 4-player game. There isn't enough green to play 3 or 2-player games. Why do companies do that? They can't be saving that much money.

SOLD (September 23, 2010)

This is an interesting abstract game that is pretty reminiscent of Hey That's My Fish because of similar setup, movement, and the area enclosure goal, but slightly more complicated because of the way scoring is calculated.  It's an interesting luckless eurogame that I'm looking forward to trying again.  I haven't tried it with more players, but have a distinct feeling it's probably better with fewer players to minimize chaos.

In Terra Nova, players try to claim areas of land by moving control markers and placing fences. Each turn, a player must take three actions, first moving a control marker, then taking two further actions from these possibilities: 
moving a control marker (whether the same one or a different one) and/or
placing a fence next to a control marker that moved this turn.
Areas are scored once they're enclosed and contain no more than three types of landscape. Whoever has the majority of pieces in an area scores points based on the number of spaces and the number of types of landscape in the area, with fewer types scoring more points. Points are split in case of a tie. The game ends once all areas have been scored.

I have trouble scoring in a crowd. My technique is to eliminate opponents, first, and hope I can catch up by the end.   Even though I sometimes win I don't think I'm really that good at it -  except for the destruction part.

This has turned out to be more fun that what I expected by just reading about it.

Compare to CLANS: I "get" this one better.

For a perfect information, no chance (no dice) abstract strategy game, this game sure feels like it has too much chaos and luck! (I wonder if any of that could be mitigated enough to my liking through rules variants?) The luck comes from having no idea (most of the time) what the other players (at least all of the players) will do.

There are a huge number of options each player has for each of their guys each turn. Sometimes it is clear what they are likely to do, but it takes a lot of analysis to determine their best move, and then form your best move in such a way as to prevent them from making a good move, and benefiting your chances of enclosing a better area, and not getting blocked in by someone else. The analysis can be fun, but can be quite a brain burner if you try too hard at it. (But too much luck if you don't.)

Have mostly played with 3 or 4 players. Imagine it would be much less chaotic with 2.

I enjoy it, but it's not what I was expecting when I bought it. Probably expected more strategy, less brain burn, but got a more tactical than strategic experience.

I hate the initial placement phase. The board always seems so overcrowded and everyone puts their pieces in "my" territory. I think I'd rather just do this phase really fast and randomly and get it over with, because try as you might to be strategic during the setup, I'm pretty sure it's NOT going to make much difference, and will just be a waste of time and brain cells (being a brain burner). You may guess right with how you will end up using a few of your guys initially, but with the other 6-9 guys, someone else will move in the way unexpectedly and you'll have to choose a completely different direction (or at great expense, use 2 or 3 moves with the same guy to get around them).

Interesting area control game. Incorporates elements of Carcassonne while actually rousing my interest. Plus, it comes with loads of super handy small hexagon pieces.

Not sure I really need this in my collection since I already have H!TMF and Through the Desert. The number of cowboys seems too many for board size, and placement rarely feels meaningful.

The key for first time players is to understand the notion of territories and how they are not created until 3 or less land types are enclosed.  This was the single biggest point of confusion on our first play.  Beyond that this is quite a fun, territory building game with lots of opportunities to try and "stick it to ya" for the other players.

A real brain burner that has similarities to Hey! That's my Fish and reminds me a bit of Yinsh in how it plays. The advantage of this over H!TMF is that setup time is much shorter. On the other hand this is a longer, heavier game which is a positive or negative depending on your tastes. While I'd be happy to own this I don't think I'll buy it cause I already have several games that scratch a very similar itch in my collection.

RATING: 8
This is the sort of game that probably needs multiple plays to appreciate, but since I'm so spoiled for choice on games to play, I doubt this one will get any more than the 1 it's had so far.

Solid no-luck brain burner. It might actually be too much of a brain burner for what it is; my opponent took much longer on his turns than I did and pretty consistently outplayed me in terms of blocking/board position, but I only lost by 1 point, which makes me think that perhaps the game is more tactical than it appears. It seems like it would be chaos with 4, though if I played it again, it most likely would be with that many (with 2, I think I'd rather just play something like Go than this).

Many games I rate 8 are games that I could be content with if they were my only options, but I can't really justify owning. Ultimately it comes down to the knowledge that I could've played about 6 games of Hive in the amount of time I spent playing this once, and I would've gotten just as much tactical satisfaction out of the experience.

My first experience with this game was not great, but I can admit it is not a bad game. I might have enjoyed it better if we played with the right rules though- the people explaining the rules did it by memory and got some of it wrong. Overall, it's not a bad game but does not strike me as a favorite. Somewhere between not wanting to play it too often and good enough for me to like it. Average, I suppose.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A short Coal Baron type worker placement game with some push your luck elements... that works REALLY well.  I did like Coal Baron, however this one replaces it for me.  Only played 3 player so far, and it worked perfectly fine.  Interested to try it at 2 and 4.  I love the push your luck elements, and yes, they can be a bit swingy, but it works IMHO really well here.  Looking forward to more plays, and I might have to get my own copy of this...

Beautiful little game... and by little, I mean little. Too little. If the cards and board were bigger, so would my score, but my ham hands struggled with these little cards. Still, 8/10 is one of my top games.

This is about as simple and middle-of-the-road as worker placement games can get.   Collect resources, fulfill orders.   That's about it.   There are some characters that can be hired to give minor special powers.   Perhaps the only innovation here is that you can go where other players have already played by spending additional workers, or using extra workers to boost bonus die rolls.   Your workforce each round is quite large - something like 9-15 workers.   

The game is TINY.  Perhaps smaller in scale than any game I have ever played.   Card art is so minuscule.   That's a shame, as this game could benefit by larger production and more bold presentation of the cool art.   Text on everything will require a microscope or a young friend to read.   I liked the game but would like it even more if it were (literally) twice as big.

RATING: 5
Potion making is a great theme foundation and scalable worker placement is also a plus. On the one hand I enjoy the exotic Japanese flavor in the form of the artwork and the Japanese text left on the cards, but on the other hand it does make for a busy mess to look at, detracting from functionality.

Gathering resources for VP making recipes is nothing new. Keeping track of resources with sliding cubes is a tiresome solutions I wish new games would avoid. The drawing of new cards, only serves to make a ever changing set of choices for your workers, but is not terribly dynamic and ends up being a fussy way to create a board with variable set up.

Ultimately I would play this game, but walk away no richer for my time.

RATING: 7.5
Nice worker placement with a dash of luck (dice and card draws).

I enjoyed it but scored badly compared to the other players. It's all very simple and quick to figure, plays out in just 4 rounds.

Collect resources and contracts, pay in resources to fulfill contracts, get assistants to use special powers. All very simple stuff, not too much to dispute.

The nice part is the rising cost. To go in any location costs at least +1 worker than was already there. So if you're the first to place, 1 worker gets the action. If I want the same action, it costs me at least 2 workers. But if I over-pay, I get +1 to a die roll that gets me bonuses.

Every round, you get more workers but you must also use workers to support assistants, and the assistants give you useful actions.

I score badly as I didn't get good contracts, got no synergy going, and didn't aim high enough. But I enjoyed the inter-action of raising the cost for other players whilst also gaining an advantage in that rise. Overall, a nice production and whilst not one I'm great at, I'm happy to play again.

Recommended if you like this sort of thing.

Another efficient and clean design by Kuro. This base distills worker placement down to a lean and streamlined little game. There aren't a ton of choices each turn, but all the choices are interesting.

There is a luck factor in this game in the same way as in Stone Age. It is a calculated risk you can take which I like. It adds a bit more flavour and excitement to the game.

Played with my brother and was surprised by how quickly it moved and how easy it was to pick up. By the second round we were solid in what we had to do and at first I rated it a high 7 but I find myself thinking about a lot and wanting to go again - so it deserves the promotion to 8.

Not hard to get into, though there is a slight learning curve. If you are a fan of video game series such as the Atelier titles, and if your an anime and/or JRPG fan to begin with, you will feel right at home with this. The artwork is very reminiscent to your typical chibi anime art, and while it may take a little time to learn, my wife and I had a game down and complete (the first ever) within a couple of hours. 
There are also YouTube video walkthroughs, but as the game weight suggests (2.44), it's not that complicated. If you want to be an overseer and control a bunch of alchemists to smite the competition within the 4 year/4 round mechanic, then you'll have a lot of fun! 
The only major caveat I have though is that the winner is the one who either gets the max number of points, or whoever has the most points after 4 rounds/years. I'd say play it one of two ways; play until the 4 years are up, or play until someone reaches the max number of points, because you cannot possibly get done all that you want to in the time given. 
Otherwise, a fun little game with strategy that we plan on playing a lot of!

Pleasant worker placement game that can be played in one hour... with dice rollings that can definitely decide the winner (in an Euro-style game!). Basically nothing new excepting the Japanese humorous artwork.

RATING: 5
A blatant rip-off of last year’s Glück Auf. I wouldn’t have minded if the author at least had sticked to the classic Japanese kaizen principle and improved on it. While he succeeded in covering the framework with a new fantasy coat (which in itself is extremely derivative) and adding a new engine-building element, he messed up the working design by introducing random die rolls that are far more important than any small efficiency advantage gained by good play.

Imagine Stone Age with broken card abilities and artwork reminiscent of the Devil May Cry menu screen. The passing mechanism is its one redeeming quality.

RATING: 6
A fine worker placement game with very nice art and the "atelier series" theme (Subjective, but I am a sucker for JAPANESE THINGS in general).

While it some unique mechanics, the game play doesn't diverse much from standard euro worker placement.

*Could be a 7 if cards are bigger! (I understand its a Japanese game and Japan is more constrain by physical space, but still...) 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid worker placement with not much of an engine building aspect and a low tension level. Using an interesting method for placing workers as you're paying the cost of placing by your workers. Plays really quickly, definitely doesn't last for 100 minutes. There may be a minor luck based balance issue with points from perfect transformations.

RATING: 7
The game's fun. It's pretty standard worker placement stuff with a heavy anime layer on top and quite a bit of randomness added.
The game's not easy to get on the table though. Pretty strict player count (euhm... 3-4 iirc?), enough little rules to be too much to demand from inexperienced players while also having enough randomness to turn off a big portion of the eurogame crowd. That being said, it's a good kind of randomness: simply getting more free stuff. And you can mitigate it (this is quite costly though). It's only when one player gets lucky a bit too often that the game skews heavily in his or her favour.
I'm not sure what's the target audience. People like me who are attracted by the theme?

Curious about the TMG release. Have they kept the compact box size and components? Have they reworked the pretty bad rules booklet? Etc.

Coal Baron esque worker placement where you gain more workers each round according to turn order.  Gather resources, transmute them to complete contracts, hire assistants.  Clever, light WP game.  Text is tiny.  Dice rolls exist giving some randomness to resource acquisition and transmuting for points.

Not a well designed game, extremely take that, but in a pointless and unthematic way. Whilst there's a deck that means you can replay this game, the actions are static and not variable enough to warrant playing again.

A straightforward little worker placement game in a delightfully tiny box. Somewhat simplistic and procedural flow: You get some simple variable player powers from the assistant cards acquired but the amount of engine building included is limited to exactly that.

Unlike some other Japon Brand titles of Spiel 2014, this one has decent component quality. The listed playing time is misleading; At least with three players, the game takes only about an hour.

[thing=143515]Coal Baron[/thing] light. Yah Coal Baron is pretty light but this is even more so. Set collection worker placement. Adorable art and will be a very good entry game for euro gamers. I will gladly teach this to anyone starting out in the games world. I think it will be mediocre for regular gamers but awesome for casual gamers. Very enjoyable.

Light worker placement game with really small footprint. Some may find the small size a hindrance, but I appreciate it. Pretty anime artwork.

I would also say that this game is easier to play than Lords of Waterdeep or Stone Age, but unfortunately the niche art and small footprint will probably stop it from becoming a staple gateway game.

Cute and basic worker placement game. Some interesting twists: 1) Gaining special abilities via helpers, 2) Being able to use an already-used space if you put in enough works, 3) die rolling mechanic. Also like the small box size. Might pick this up if it were more easily available.

Worker placement game about running alchemy factories. I've only been able to play it once so far and I liked what I saw. Granted I love Gust's Atelier series, so I'm a little biased towards anything that comes close to providing the feel of those games.

Something tells me my concerns later are going to be the tiny decks that make up the game. I'm not referring to the cards (which look to be BSG skill card/Talisman card-sized), but the tiny number of gathering locations and forges available. I know the odds of a Japanese game company releasing an expansion to a game is almost unheard of, but this one might need a few more cards to avoid repetition. I didn't feel that way with the number of Assistants or Orders though.

A really fun and thematic game, a bit similar to the Atelier video games. However, be vary that the english rules are pretty badly translated. There are bits that are plain wrong and it's extremely lacking in the details department. The japanese rules are  better but you have to know japanese for them, so, yeah.

Good game, bad localization. Give it a spin if that doesn't scare you away.

RATING: 7.5
Despite its small components (in terms of cards, font and board), this game is a beauty to behold if you like manga artwork. I really do, so I added half a point to the score for just this reason. In terms of gameplay a 7 would be more appropriate, as it plays like a gateway worker placement game with an action selection system derived from Coal Baron and some added dice rolls for a degree of uncertainty. Still, the game is involving enough to be enjoyed by serious gamers. Especially since the game can be played in an hour with three players. The small box makes the game highly portable, even though it is quite a puzzle to make everything fit in there.

I like this game quite a bit. The worker mechanisms are FANTASTIC and I'd like to see them used in other games. The die rolling is absolutely going to ruin this for some players but I don't mind. What I do mind is that the math on the conversions is inconsistent. Some cards are just worse. 

I would have liked larger text on the assistant cards but that's not much of a quibble. Overall it's an accessible WP game with minimal waste and a couple standout great qualities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Worker placement and goods conversion to accept projects consisting of alchemical recipes, collect ingredients to match the recipes, and transmute them into victory points at the forge.  Employ assistants to boost productivity.  The crux of the game is worker action locations cannot be blocked but require committing workers in groups that exceed the number at that location.  The other distinctive feature is a modified dice roll to get a perfect action.

I found Ars Alchimia to be a very pleasant game that succinctly captures the feeling of alchemy JRPGs without all the stuff that I find annoying or boring. It’s not an extremely unique game, but it’s not trying to be. Instead, it’s a very streamlined, rules-light worker placement game that doesn’t overstay its welcome. It reminds me a bit of if Ticket to Ride had been reconceived as a worker placement game. I think this is both a great game to introduce worker placement to newer gamers as well as a nice, fairly mellow, tactical game for gamers that want something easy to play that still offers some nice decisions. Lived up to my expectations for sure.

Preordered, 1/11.  Really looking forward to this game. Even though I have Steel Wolves, I believe this will be a very playable and quick game for when that instant U-boat fix is needed.

Received 11/11.  I like the game play and components. It is not the quick play I imagined but still fun.  

My rating will probably go higher once the rules for Crash Dive, Silent Running and Go Deep are repaired--never really fixed to my liking.  So so game.

7/12 Playing now with the tactical expansion game from Grumpyoldgamer. This really adds a lot to this game and is worth the effort to print out, laminate, cut and digest the ruleset.

I love this game so much. I want an expansion for it or something though. I had a week roughly where this game was all I did with my free time. It culminated with an awesome two sub attack on the Empress of Britain and a freighter which turned out to be a destroyer. It sank my veteran commander, but my rookie lived to fight another day. Truly incredible game, that I wish had a two player option.

Reading rule book today! (11/2).
After four plays, dropped my rating to a 7.  This game is more fun than challenging to play.  The level of difficulty seems to be lacking in this game as compared with Phantom or Hornet Leader.  Still a fun game and one I will play from time to time.  This does, however, still leave me looking for that perfect U boat game :shake:

Board, counters, cards, player aids; all have fine artwork and made from quality materials. Rulebook is easy to digest and the examples provide ample explanations to game play. Campaigns cover almost all U-boat operations in the Atlantic Ocean during WWII. One can get fun and satisfaction from this solitaire game. Although it does not deal with all details during a U-boat’s fire and movement, the actions are historical and results accurate. It has planning and tense action when getting close to the prey but it also portrays the misgiving of whether you are going to make it alive from the mission. On each campaign you get to control a variety U-boat types and based on the tonnage sunk you get the proper score, letting you know how well you manifested as a U-boat Leader. Very audacious. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another Leader game that I fully enjoy. Subs have always interested me, to me there's something romantic about being that silent deadly stalker...A giant mechanical assassin. So when U-Boat Leader was announced I instantly pre-ordered. Slightly below average production for DVG compared to the other leader games, this one was also not designed by Dan Verssen so there is a bit of a different feel than other Leader Games. As I write this all I want to do is go home and setup a game and stalk some prey.

not a bad game, but didn't really hit it off with me. Two much micro management of chits and not enough upfront tactical decisions of interest. I found Thunderbolt Apache to be a more engaging game, but i don't think this is a solo system i can really get into.

RATING: 4
Just finished playing U-Boat leader and its pretty bad.  I am pretty disappointed actually.  Thunderbolt Apache Leader is a hard act to follow, no doubt.  But [thing=85108][/thing] is pretty darn monotonous.  After a quick introductory turn or two, I started the long campaign game (4 patrol/submarine) starting Sept 1939, you buy submarines with OP points like you did with the air leader games and you can save some for use later.  Having played [thing=17484][/thing], I was wondering what my "squadron" of subs is suppose to represent?  With the air series, I can pretend I am the commander of a small squadron but its not how submarines groups work.  I ended up with 6 subs but I know historically that there are dozens more involved in the conflict at this early stage of the war...  I accepted the abstraction and moved on...

You start the game moving the submarines into various areas and selecting random event cards to see what occurs during each move... totally out of your control, usually bad things happen... sometimes you can spend torpedoes/stress to get victory points!  Which undermines the purpose of the actual tactical battles!  Oh well... (you could argue that the torpedoes could be better spent elsewhere... but not by much in my experience.)

After the moving/patrolling, you roll dice to work out how many contacts your subs make with Allied Shipping.  This seems to work fine (there are some modifiers, but you basically just roll a dice)... but since there really isn't much of a time limit to the game as a whole, I found that this part of the game not very tense.  Yes... every turn you stay out at sea means you will pick up more of them bad event cards... but since your armaments can only last 4-5 battles max (3 is average)... finding a ton of Allied Convoys isn't going to do you much good.

Once you make contact, you pick out a convoy card and place the ships on a [thing=65564][/thing] like tactical situation board, but this time you don't even have to pick your ordinances before hand!  Your options are being on the water surface to fire your gun & torpedoes OR being submerged and less exposed.  There is a clever mechanic where the faster ships with move AWAY from the slower ships (including your U-Boat).  But once you get use this relative movement, you'll develop optimal strategies that works best, then monotony settles in.  The Allied Escorts, Naval & Merchant ships are simply not very varied.  The combat is very deadly for both you and the enemy and that means, with careful planning you will sink tonnes of ships and any risk taking on your part is suicide.  You are ALWAYS better off, running away as soon as there are any chance of coming under enemy fire!  (That's a spoiler!)

Another thing that didn't translate well at all from the air leader series is the concept of "Stress", in the air leader series, your pilots got stressed and your planes got damaged, in [thing=123955][/thing], the damage was further broken down to specific damage which had realistic affects on your plane's performance.  In [thing=85108][/thing] there are NO such thing as pilots, but they kept the concept of "stress" any way.  When your U-boats are damaged by depth charges and cannon fire... it gets "Stressed"?!?  Simply doesn't work conceptually and the game would've been much better if your submarines got specific damage that cause mechanical problems.  This seems too tacked on for me and didn't translate well in this new system.  

I ended up conceding the game about 33% of the way in... NOT because I was losing, but because I had already obtained 60% of the Victory Points to get a "Great" winning result!  The outcome seemed rather predictable, so instead of plowing through a few more hours of monotony... I decided to quit.   This coming from someone that played through both [thing=17484][/thing] & [thing=22359][/thing] both of which took many days to finish... 

The strategic situation was never tense at all and the game was way too easy, which is never a good thing in a solitaire game. On top of it all, the rule book for some unknown reason I can't put my finger on... was very obtuse and took forever to read... 

Some comparisons are in order here, since both [thing=17484][/thing] & [thing=85108][/thing] are remarkably similar is many ways.  Both are about submarine warfare in WWII and both games cover the war on a strategic and tactical level.  Silent war has much larger scope and on the strategic level has extreme statistic accuracy and the random events were very historically inclined.  In [thing=85108][/thing], the situation presented is historical but from this point on there is nothing historical about the game at all strategically!  The random events are ... random, the number of U-boats you control seemed arbitrary and has no basis in military structure... totally game-y.  Tactically, the combat in [thing=85108][/thing] is if anything more complicated than that in [thing=17484][/thing], which isn't a good thing because the choices you are faced with is the same and even the results tend to be similar in both games... but its simply more drawn out with [thing=85108][/thing]!  

Overall, the tactical combat didn't do it for me, but it wasn't all that bad... it was at least quick playing compared to [thing=41490][/thing] because you dispensed with ordinance choices, which in that game took up a lot of your time (selecting ordinances), and unlike [thing=2154][/thing], ordinance is unlimited and free, so you ended up choosing the same configuration most of the time any way.  The strategic game and campaign game fell totally flat for me.  If I had to pick the CREAM OF THE CROP for the Leader series as it is currently (BY FAR!):  Buy [thing=123955][/thing], its unbelievably good.

only played once right now, but the theme is very very interesting to me. I like a lot to see the name of the captain on every U-boat, the name of a single escort and merchant, the chance to improve the experience, going in the open sea and look for a merchant ship, the stress concept... it remembers me the U-96 movie... and all in a easy to understand and play wargame.

Juego sobre submarinos y caza de convoys en el que manejando una serie de submarinos tendras que tratar de hundir el mayor numero de barcos posibles, todo ello cuidando que los mismos lleguen a buen puerto de vuelta. No es de los mejores en su genero pero como solitario que es resulta muy entretenido para echar unas partidillas ademas de que puede jugarse de forma cooperativa manejando cada jugador un submarino. Le pongo un 6.8 sobre 10.

RATING: 5.8
Contribute to the war effort; sink merchant ships! Be sure to use the updated rules from the manufacturer's website and the BGG forum for this game. They fix some loopholes/flaws and create a more tense atmosphere. You'll almost hear your submarine's hub creak and whine from the pressure.

And be sure to have watched the famous "Das Boot" movie!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The components are attractive and put together well but as far as gameplay goes, it is simply broken. The basic framework of a great game is in there, but the current state of rules contain glitches which can prevent an escort from ever being able to attack a sub. Basicaly, anytime an escort attempts to attack, the sub (depending if it's surfaced or submerged) can play either a Crash Dive, Silent Running, or Deep Dive reaction and completly negate all attacks against it for the remainder of that round. As if that wasn't bad enough, if you happen to have a sub with an Aggressive skipper, you can get your attacks in without penalty and without fear of counter-attacks...and once the player figures this out on his own, the game ceases to be a challenge.

RATING: 7
I found that I enjoyed U-Boat Leader for a number of reasons.

First, it’s actually not purely a tactical game. Yes the tactical aspects are there when you get into the fight but this is a stripped down view and approach which I appreciated. It didn’t feel like I was dealing with very technical aspects and not simulating being a U-Boat captain but gave me enough for my level of tolerance. Also, you have the operational and strategic aspects of the war and campaigns which broaden the picture nicely and make things very interesting indeed.

Next, the rules were pretty good to go through to play the system. I didn’t feel that I was struggling and it came together for me without too much effort. The rulebook is done rather well and reasonably user friendly which helped me learn the game.

Third, the information I needed was readily available through the cards and Player aids. I didn’t have to refer to myriads of charts and subsets of rules. U-Boat Leader was easier than I expected it to be, if I’m honest, although it by no means is an easy game that I would recommend to newbies. I would say moderate complexity is accurate as you do need to invest the time to familiarize yourself with how the system works.

Overall, this is as deep as I would care to go with this type of game. A very interesting experience which was enough to give me a feel for the key aspects of this aspect of the War in the Atlantic without burning my brain up and worse, boring me with the technical details found in more simulation-type games. I found it to be just the right mix in depth, strategy, and most importantly, fun, and it all comes in this very nice game from DVG Games. A nice production and a good alternative for those who like me, don’t like tactical simulations.

Not as much choice as the other Leader-games. Not quite as much tingly nerves either. I would like to be able to get rid of detection counters with silent running. Now I go in, fire all torpedoes, and run. If the convoy means i can't get to it without running into Escorts, I take another convoy. There is no real hurry. So a good game, it's only downside is that it will be compared to the other leader-games, and in that company this is a pretty weak link.

This game just never scratched the itch for me.  The rulebook was poorly written and the game tried to work both as a tactical and strategic simulation. I don't think it succeeded on either level.  

Like The Hunters, combat is mostly luck dependant,  and is resolved via simple die rolls.  Contrast it to AH's Submarine, a true simulation, and this game will leave you wanting a lot more.  

Based solely on content quality, this game would score an 8 or 9 easily. Unfortunately, under the pretty veneer, there is little enjoyable gameplay.  

In recent months there has been a lot of new material added by players which apparently has addressed many of the game's shortcomings.  Unfortunately, the game lost me long ago, and I have no interest in returning to it.

Immerhin eine kurze Kampagne dieses Solospiels um die „Schlacht im Atlantik“ habe ich spielen können: sehr schöner Kampfmechanismus, U-Boot-Kapitäne können Erfahrung gewinnen und ‚befördert‘ werden, U-Boote sind je nach Kriegsperiode ausrüstbar.
Dennoch kommt irgendwie keine "Geschichte" auf; man handelt nur (wiewohl sinnvolle) Mechanismen ab. Hat man die Wahl zwischen "U-Boat Leader" und "The Hunters", so entscheide man sich besser für letzteres.

A different type of Solo game from DVD games. In most others, you know what you need to do and try to build up for it.

In U-boat you get loaded up with weapons and go out and look for trouble without getting into too much.

IMHO the combat system is flawed. Once you figure out how to attack, one can rack up points quickly. They added a new system for attacking after the game was published which should have been done before it was printed. I didn't like the event cards the way they have it. A card should have been added to reshuffle the deck at some point. The way it is now every event will occur. For me Steel Wolves & Silent War handle events better. It's more of a game than a simulation. I may try it again but I was disappointed.

After getting over the confusion between the printed and living rules, I'm really enjoying this game.  While not a "simulation" I love the decisions that one has to make as you stalk a convoy with one or more boats, decide when to dive, when to surface, where to break through the escort ring, what targets and how many torpedoes to fire.  And I'm able to play with my sons who can each take command of a boat and turn it into a cooperative game.

The game starts interesting, but then quickly gets repetitive.  There is not a time limit for either the strategic or tactical portions of the game and if you are patient enough you can simply wait for weakly protected merchant ships and just ignore the more heavily defended ones.  Second, crash dive can be abused if you then attack afterwards.  The movement in the tactical portion can be gamed too.  If you take advantage of the above, the game is not that difficult.  Like Silent War, it gets really hard to get excited about the next convoy you encounter since many of the ships blend together.

130929 The only reason I haven't played it more is the fear that a bad player can throw the game to a specific player by accident.  Otherwise, this really is a great game.  Its part of my NoThanks/HighSociety/Ra/ModernArt quartet of auction awesomeness.

100619 wow...an intense auction game.  With all the different types of auction and the setup its a total brainburner.  But obviously I'm in an auction kick cause I am absolutely digging it.  I do think it will be hard to pull out though, I think it may be a bit heavy for the crowd I roll with and since that auction / single mechanic games are somewhat out of vogue.

Modern Art is a pretty great auction game, but it's hard to get it to the table when [thing=12][/thing] and [thing=56786]Kamon[/thing] exist. Then again, those don't get to the table that much, either, so perhaps I just have too many auction games? 

In either case, I love the trickiness of the different types of auctions in this game. The simplicity of Ra is still a little more appealing to me, but this one seems to be easier to read your opponents for some reason. 

Plus, the latest edition by CMON is drop-dead gorgeous (so is the OINK games edition) so you're really spoiled for choice -- at such a low price, you really need to check this game out!

An exploration of a single mechanic, this game is made up of five different variations on an auction process. As such it feels like a very pure game. Nothing distracts from its central theme. Auctions are, by their nature, interactive, so it never feels dry. The Mayfair English edition has terrible components (photocopied rules, bad artwork, horrible plastic poker chips) so I made my own set, which is much more satisfying to use.

Fun at first but after a while everybody has learned to play and is executing the same strategy.

2016-02-04
My initial comments were not fair, since I was playing with the same group. Change one person in the table and the dynamics of the game change completely. Sometimes you have to be aggressive and accept lesser profits just to win something. However, the basic strategy is still the same, spread the good you give evenly to the others while securing all good from others to yourself.

Modern Art is a solid auction game with no obvious flaws. The only downside of it is that you need at least 4 players for the bidding action to be any fun. The thing that keeps the game alive and interesting are the different auction mechanisms and market speculation.

First impressions are extremely good.

This is fun!  The players tend to fall around laughing at various points (I'm lucky to have a good crowd) as all sorts of jokes about the art and the worth of the artists fly around.

It's (almost) a heavy-medium brain-burner which makes itself feel lighter due to this banter and fun...that's a REALLY good quality in a game.

It has about the right element of luck in it.  Yes "Luck."  I think luck can really add subtlety and replayability.  There's enough here to sway the game a little, but not too much against strong players.

As I play it more, I would speculate that my score may move up a little.

Great appeal to both casuals and core gamers. Probably my best purchase so far. Negative: some bids are a bit weird- everyone knows the exact value of the art so its reasonable to bid all the way up to $1 less than that value but you dont because human pyschology..

A very fun auction game, actually its the best auction game I've ever played.

strategic betting game. first impression is that I prefer Ra. The value of paintings is dependent on how many paintings by the same painter have sold. The value depends on both short term sales and long term sales. There is a fair bit of strategy involved, choosing when to sell paintings and bidding tactics. Good game

RATING: 7.5
This game comes across as surprisingly simple but  fun. Other than the fact that it takes a few rounds to figure out the value of things, just about anyone could get into this very easily! No downtime, very engaging, clever system for making popular artist worth more in the future and yet never predictable, highly recommended!

Update 2007 03 25: I've knocked this down from a 9 to a 7.5 because I usually want to play something else. Can't quite explain it.

An auction game. Player sells art with different auction method. And player gets to buy arts as well. End of 1 season, sell the arts. Most art sold for that season value the most. Price of arts price accumulates after each season. And after 4 seasons, player with the most cash wins. 

Box comes with not-so-nice stuff but the idea of the game it's genius. It's fun, it's interactive. So grab a glass of water for everyone and start bidding.

Neat auction game.  Would need to play again and see how the final scores are before making up my mind, though.

Gameplay seemed interesting, in that you can win without winning a single auction (in theory), but I'm not sure if that would hold up over time.

After another play, there seem to be pretty clear strategies about how to win, but the strategies aren't nearly as fun to use compared with just auctioning whenever you feel like it.  The game is also very susceptible to "not-so-great players decide the winner" effects, as one bid out of left field can decide who wins.

Similar to Dominion, playing for fun won't generally allow you to win, but playing to win won't generally allow you to have fun.

Would not need to own, but would probably play again.

Rápido de entender y por lo que parece tras dos partidas, muy complicado de manejar. Las mecánicas del juego son sencillas, basado en varios tipos de subasta. El control del dinero es clave, teniendo que gastar y ahorrar inteligentemente durante toda la partida. El grado de azar no es muy alto pero tiene su importancia, ya que decide los cuadros que podrás vender a lo largo de la partida (se puede corregir jugando bien tus cartas).

It's my favorite auction game.  The person with the most double auctions usually wins - so if you divide them equally you can avoid that issue.

Very cool auction game, although not as straight-forward as Medici.

For a while, I thought I didn't know what a "good" bid was.  It seemed too simple of a mathematical calculation.  There had to be more to it.  But there isn't.  It is what it is, and the real "game" is in choosing to place the bid or not...NOT in determining what the right bid is.

RATING: 9
Fantastic. The new production by CMON is gorgeous. THis game plays quick but has interesting decisions every round. Very highly recommended.

for anyone playing this game for the first time: Buying paintings in this game is kind of a trap. It's easy to look at a painting that is going to be likely or even for sure worth $30 and say, if I bid $28, I'll make money so that's a good bid. But what just happened was the auctioneer made $28, and you made $2. If this type of bidding happens in your play, a seller will crush everyone. But in a really tight game, wooooo this is a razor's edge. Fantastic stuff

3-5(4,5)

A solid game that distills the gameplay to various types of auctions, and figuring out when to auction a particular artist, and which auction to use is brilliant, as is the fact that it's generally a poor idea to buy your own auction. Thus, there are a lot of interactions at play. You want to auction something appealing to others but also build up your own artists, and choose a maximal auction type, etc.

I agree with some that double auctions can feel a bit overpowered in that they can disproportionately influence the popular artists. The bidders are going to pump up the prices a bit, but the benefit really goes to the seller who gains from having the double. Still, a very engaging game.

Played once, confused once. I couldn't see the driving mechanism for this, and thought that the other players were just being charitable buying the crap that I had on offer. Maybe I just have a jaundiced view of the art world in general (talentless daub, promoted by brainless idiots who can't get a 'proper job', and bought by the grossly over-rich who just want to get into the artists pants). Much to my surprise (and disgust) I did well in the game, but goodness knows how or why.

My lightbulb moment so far as Eurogames were concerned.  The rules are simple and yet Modern Art incorporates elements of hand management and timing with an absolute need to pay attention to what your opponents are doing and how they are bidding.  The auctions are deliciously tense.

I love this game enough to own both the German and the Chinese editions. The artwork on the Chinese cards is really nice, while the characters are almost as easily understood as icons.  The money is another story; the variations on brown and green are too difficult to tell apart.

After playing this game for a few months, I must say this is the best game that I have ever played.  It took me a while to appraise each painting correctly, but the wait was worth it.  I am still learning the subtle strategies in this gem!

One of the few Knizia games I kinda like. The different auction types are fun but their outcomes are predictable: The 1-round bid cards go to their original owner, and the 2x cards usually decide the winning artists by themselves.

I think it's fantastic, however I continue to perform terribly whenever I play and I really long to do better. 
It's quite amazing; a game in which you essentially only have to make two decisions each turn - whether to buy/sell, and at what price - yet I am constantly baffled by my inability to do either successfully.

Deep auction thinking I suppose.  But is it fun? Not that much.

For my tastes, the auctions feel a bit too tied up with mere financial calculations.  Crunching math for an hour or so is not THAT much fun...or is it?  Spreadsheets anyone?  And I suppose when you win, you get to feel like you calculated the value of more paintings, more accurately, more often, than the other players.  Hooray?! 

In addition, presumably, you "play your hand" in the correct order, which provides, at most, only moderate enjoyment for me in this game.  Which painting should I auction from my hand this round?  That's it.  That is your "interesting" decision every single blessed round.  Interesting? Barely.

Players who are dealt double auction cards (sometimes A LOT of double auction cards) seem to have advantages in the game, and the players who happen to immediately follow double auction dealt players also seem to have advantages, since suddenly the better market for that painter is virtually instantly established.  Does that break the game? Maybe. Does it really matter?  Maybe.

Players who foolishly bid too high, giving random players too much money for little worth, also break the game, or perhaps more accurately, DECIDE the game.

All in all, this game feels very close, but it is not quite, enjoyable.

An extremely interactive game of collusion, price fixing, and some bluffing. No art knowledge necessary, but the game is not for the faint of math, since a fair amount of quick arithmetic is necessary to do well. After 4 plays the game still seems strategically fresh, but I'm not sure about its long-term ability to hold our attention once we've teased out most of the optimal values. 

As an interesting plus, the game is also a good learning tool for anyone interested in imperfect economic systems, price manipulation, or the applications of these concepts in the art market.

The game is really fun to play, but the component quality of the game leaves much to be desired.

It needs more plays for a proper rating, and it doesn't get much because while my group is attracted by the auction mechanism, at the end of all the games we've played we failed to guess the winner correctly and it felt like we were playing the game wrong for some reason.

I'm looking forward to more plays and I'm pretty sure it's rating can only go higher from this point.

Amazing set of bidding instructions. Wonderful choices to be made and lots of pure player interaction. However, it can be difficult to ascertain the leader, so strategic play is muted.

The best auction game. The brazilian edition is a great looking one.

Very interesting mechanics where the key is to be the player who more closely identifies the potential value of an art work at the end of a season.

Also important is trying to keep track of which adversary is probably winning the game (or closer to you, if you think you're winning) and take care not to benefit this player too much when you trade with him, because on every purchase there's a division of profits between seller and buyer.

I think this dynamics is pretty neat, and makes for a very exciting game of bluffing and smart guessing. Not to mention the incredibly funny trash talk that goes around the table when players are trying to lower the value of art works put up for auction by their adversaries.

If you like auction games, you really should try this one.

A wonderful game of auctions.  The type of auction doesn't really matter once the players are used to the game, but the different auction types do make for some variety.  It's a simple enough game to teach to new players, but has enough depth to be interesting to everyone.  The only problem lies in persuading new players *not* to overpay for their own paintings.

I know it's a classic Knizia but something about it just leaves me little cold. It's all about the calculation and the play level of the entire group, I'll play it but I feel that I let the group down by not being as much into it as they are. Which is a shame...

I'm not one to complain much about this effect, but I find the degree to which a single person (including me!) can throw off the balance of play in this game to be astounding.  Maybe open money would be better?  I like it as a random valuation exercise, but I think I'd rather play against AI than people.  This isn't to mention the strength of doubles either.  Overall, I might prefer to play Master's Gallery.

Got the 1996 edition in the Unity Games XV math trade. Very math-oriented, which is not surprising given its creator, Knizia.  I enjoy the speculation aspect of the game, but I question whether it will have staying power. Ultimately couldn't stand the awful artwork; I will probably make my own version using classic art someday. 

Picked up Arte Moderna edition in the Unity Games XVI math trade. The artwork of this edition is significantly better - now I can enjoy this game.

One of the first auction games, yet still the best of them. The mechanics feel straight-forward, yet are full of depth, and the different tactics you can adopt are very wide, and satisfying.

UPDATE: Still loving it! The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it only plays optimally with 5 players, while it's rather good with 4. Don't even try it with 3!

UPDATE: The more games I get, the more my older games seem to be falling a bit into oblivion. I still like this one a lot, but I'm downgrading it into an 8, due to better choices out there.

I still haven't quite figure out how to win at this game.  At times it feels like I can make a good play that will seriously affect my ability to win.

Realistically themed bidding game with several auction types. Easy rules make it an excellent introduction into German bidding games, probably more so than Ra or Medici. On the other hand it's difficult to figure out the relative pay out scale between owning and selling paintings. Players generally feel involved throughout the game, especially with 4 players.

Deceptive game - its not really about the paintings at all, its all about maximising profits and minimising loses and try to ensure the opposite happens to your opponents. You can win this game quite easily by never buying any paintings.

It's a great pure auction game. It allows players to shape the market and the skill--if you're playing it at least somewhat right--is in your ability to predict, control and shape the emerging market based on your hand of cards. Every little design decision helps shape the game, from the auctioneer being able to pay the bank and to the turn skipping that can occur due to double auctions. There's probably lots of depth to its hand management that can be wrung out of this game. The game, though, is a bit fragile. If a player isn't invested in trying to control the auction so certain artists are or aren't in the top 3 of sold artists, this game can go poorly. Still, this game has a great price point and a good production. It's probably best with 4 or 5 players to lessen the chance that one of the players is able to track the opposing players' money.

Enjoyable filler that plays quickly.  However, Modern Art is a gateway for better auction games so it stays on the shelf.

I have played several games of Modern Art.  First, I have the Mayfair Edition and I really don't like it.  While I understand the arguments about quality, my beef is about the size of the art.  Who wants to bid on a bridge card sized piece of art?  Not me!   I am not complaining about the art itself, just the size of the card.

Past that, I think this game is a neat, enjoyable interactive card game.  It was my first bidding/auction game and has went over well.  I find that you need at least four to play, but five is preferable.  I tried with three and found it unplayable or at least, "I" won't play it again.

Clever auction game with a surprising amount of depth. Each choice has a myraid of permutations, most of which are dependent on human choices.

Loses .5 due to the bad art.

A game I picked up to reach the free shipping mark at Thoughthammer.com.  Wow!  I really like this.  I completely suck at it, but I really like this bidding game.  I guess I end up paying too much for art without getting enough from that which I auction.  Part of the problem is that I try to get the pieces that I have (known information) so I don't get any recompense from my opponents.  Not only would they be filling my coffers, theirs would be diminishing...that is if they weren't picking up the second or third piece of art that is in high demand.  I'll just have to keep playing and refine my bidding skills.  [Gift]

One of the great Knizia auction games. This one is pure auctions. The strategy in this game is deciding how much to bid to just pull enough profit. That, and the brilliant way the artists go up in value the more their paintings sell, make this a fabulous game that I love!

Really enjoyed this first play of this overlooked game, its a bidding game, but does in fact have a little more oomph to it as the theme can be very uplifting for the overall experience.

I got around to a second play of this game and it is on my list now, I am glad it is still available and as bidding games go it can be quite fun. A devious little game that is simple to teach and uses existing real life principles more so than a game of its size would seem to at first glance. A solid vote from me that this should be in ANY collection.

Yes there can be imbalance due to the deal of the cards and yes the game can be skewed if the player experience/ability is too varied (a sign of a good game I think) but this is a mighty game, one of my favourites. Fantastic atmosphere and tension, quick playing time and brilliant integration with the theme (who says Knizia can't do theme?). Mind you, not for everyone (my wife hates it), but everyone should at least try it once. A canonical game IMHO

Even basic strategy in this game seems to be difficult for many people on the first (or even second) time playing.

I was actually expecting this game to be more difficult. Mechanically it is fairly easy to play, and with the different auction types it has a lot of variety. The strategy of the game is very deep, with a fair ammount of mathematical thinking, bluffing and profiling/reading. With elements of efficiency, along with a fairly strong 'take that' element. This game is a classic and is certainly one of Knizer's best.

Rarely has a game been brought back to it's bare essentials like this one. This is the ultimate bidding game. The paintings that are sold have no real value but you create the value by manipulating what is available at which price. Absolute gem that has to be played to really see the beauty of the design. Components of the Mayfair edition are just horrible. Card quality is below par, the rules are photocopied (yeah, no kidding), the cardboard is warping and the insert has nothing to do with the game whatsoever.

Good game, but not sure I like how easily the game swings depending on who can get the new guy to bid for their paintings.  Maybe its because I'm the new guy. :(                                                                                           *Update* Raised rating to '7'. After playing much of a single player version of the game, I can see the elegance of it, but I still think its a little too fragile if everyone doesn't know what's going on and due to the newbie unfriendliness factor I don't think it'll ever find a spot in my collection, though I would definitely like to try this two or three times in person now that I have a slight grasp on the strategy...
*Update* I'll raise it to a 7.5.  I respect the design, but think it is a difficult game to intuit without repeated play (not newbie friendly) and too fragile for me to want to play very often.. Playing against the computer really helps.

Knizia hits another home run for me.  This game is loaded with a variety of strategies.  Knowing how much to pay, which paintings to sell, and how much to expect people to pay are all tough choices.  And there is a great build to the game as players gather more and more cash each season, but the bids become more and more educated.  I'm impressed by all the variety that can be found with just a few different styles of auctions.

But what really makes this game shine for me is the suggested variant rule that my brother instituted.  We played that you have to not only name the painting you are selling but also take on the role of a salesperson.  This lended a real party game atmosphere as we chuckled about the paintings and used ridiculous accents.  However, even with all this humor added it doesn't detract at all from the very strategic game that is underneath.

This seems to be the total package when it comes to bidding games; great mechanics for the bidding itself, I enjoy the way that score is kept, and some planning ahead will put you ahead.  Only played once so far, but it was a ton of fun.  I'll have a more accurate review whenever I can get some more plays in, but so far incredibly fun.

Update: I seem to have hit a snag; new players just end up getting killed too easily.  There is a strong basic strategy you must master to have success; don't buy your own paintings if you can avoid it and don't overpay for paintings of others.  Until you get the math you will just never ever win.  I am now at the point where playing with new players isn't all that enriching, and the old players aren't catching on.  I still have hope it will bet better with player experience, but I haven't played a great game of it in awhile.

Modern art focuses on auctions and varying values of paintings/artists. It is very streamlined and easy to learn, but the decisions are tricky and every turn is interesting. 

I enjoyed my first play of this very much, but I can also see how the game can be very different depending on who you play with. Also it's a good auction game that comes in at a tidy 30 minutes that still feels like a full experience. 

Highly recommend.

An oldie but a goodie - an auction game where how you buy and sell can influence the value of what you buy and sell.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I think the game is neat in that is has different types of auctions throughout, however I do think the game has one of the worst problems many auction games have, and that is, it can be very tough to actually gauge value, which can just ruin the game if one player messes up.  I think its a neat design, but not something I would want to play often.  Ra is a much better Auction game (and same with Medici).

My first middleweight game from Knizia.  Since then, middleweights have come to dominate family game night.  They manage a great deal of depth in a very efficient amount of time and rules.

Used to think that once everybody learns to bid optimally this game would stale. Now, I realize this isn't the case. When people start to bid optimally, you will then have to take that amount into consideration and adjust your game accordingly. This now turns into an incredibly good mind game: "Just how much is he going to deviate from the optimal bid?" 

People have complained that newbies could bid ridiculously, but I think this just adds a different layer of strategy where you would have do a little acting in order to entice or discourage newbies from bidding more. Excellent game.

If every auction was the same style, I would really get bored with this game.  But the different auction styles really liven the game up and create a fun experience.  Although set collecting with auctions is not novel, the fact that the players decide which cards to offer for auction and the fact that previous' rounds winners can really impact scoring if they can be scored again adds something really unique to this game.

I have played the new version of this and do not like it as much.  I'd much rather play this older version with all the different auctions.

New players can be a bit lost with this one - "I have no idea how much this is worth!" - and combined with the rule that the payment goes to the seller means that games can be thrown inadvertently. With an experienced group it plays a lot better but I feel there's a little too much uncertainty with the bidding (or maybe that's the point when buying modern art).

Bidding...?  Art....?  Sounds like a perfect start to a sweet little game.  

I like this game as it sets up in nothing flat, moves quickly, and swings quickly for the first place position.

It has some luck but doesn't overwhelm players to a point where the win is based upon that intrinsic luck.  It takes some plays then to develop a sense of how auctioning can benefit oneself and swing the win toward your auction house/museum.

Modern Art is probably one of the best auction games out there.  It has a lean set of rules that are easy to learn, but which create a game that is very difficult to grok.  This is simply a genius of a design.  It is also a hard sell with those who don't really like auction games to begin with.  I owned it for a number of years simply because it is such a great design, but ultimately great design does not mean it ever actually got played.  So I traded it.

A game with great interaction that plays fast & furious! A party game for gamers. Best with as many players as possible, preferably people open enough to really get into the "role" of auctioneer from their city, adopting "outrageous accents"!
Continual jockeying for position and varying relative values throughout the game make this one more subtle and elusive than many of Knizia's other auction-games. Victory will be determined by walking a fine line between sales and purchases.

Enjoyed this, though I feel my ADD (excuse) will cause me to be very challenged - lots of different bidding choices to calculate the value of paintings at the sale. My non-gaming friends enjoyed this as well, which gives it a boost in initial rating. I expect there is somewhat of a learning curve to get used to values of paintings up for auction, but this seemed to start making some sense in our first game. Looking forward to more plays.

Entertaining game - there are five different auctions and you can win by either selling or buying pictures (usually a combination of both). It is clever and thematic at the same time, but for some reason I like Ra better (maybe Ra feels less calculating). Rating could go up with further plays.

The mechanics are more dependant on the group you are playing with than any other bidding game I can think of. New players tend to be put off by the multiple layers of strategy, and can throw the bidding out of whack a lot. Best with 5.

Played with 3. This game is pretty sweet. I thought it would be too "mathy" at first, but there's enough chance (who has what cards? when will they play an artist?) to shake things up. Plus it's great selling art to somebody who expects that artist to be top-ranked...then stabbing them in the back with a double card. The only problem -- and it's a big one -- is that I have no idea what to bid.

The new CMON Edition of Modern Art is shockingly good. Their graphic design has been uneven in the past, but this is great - good usability, colorful, compact. Nice large, linen-finish cards. Excellent price point. And the contemporary artists are surprisgly effective. In general part of the satire of the theme is the terribleness of the art, and modern editions that have used actually good art makes the game attractive but sort of compromises the theme. The art in this edition - apparently by real contemporary artists - is in a good spot, obviously modern and edgy but colorful and more engaging than the checkerboards and spray paint of the classic pieces. It gives the game a more serious and less satirical flavor, but in a way that isn't inconsistent with the feel of the game.
---
This game really is an 11. If I could keep only one euro, this would probably be it.
---
Even after all this time - over 15 years of playing Modern Art - this game continues to amaze, impress, and inspire me. While I may have played games like Settlers more in that time frame, Modern Art is perhaps as close to a perfect "themed" game as I've ever played. Skill and luck are well-balanced, the pacing is perfect, there are elements of tactics, evaluation, and psychology, and it is brilliantly themed. The pieces it contains may be purposefully lousy, but the game itself is an exceptional work of art.
---
I'm not a terribly good Modern Art player, but I'll give  you my one tip that seems to have improved my play quite a bit: instead of trying to figure out what a piece is going to be worth, and then figuring out how much of a cut you are willing to give the auctioneer, instead try to think in terms of what economists call a "risk premium". Usually you can figure out what an artist probably will be worth, based on where it is currently. Then try to figure out what the risk is: what are the odds, based on your hand, the other players' holdings, where you are in the turn order, etc., that it will get trashed. Then discount your price based on your assessment of the risk. This will usually yield a sensible bid. The whole (expected value/number of players) thing is, in my opinion, bogus. You make money by taking risks on artists, and win by making good risk evaluations.

It should be said, Modern Art has a non-trivial luck element. The doubler auction cards are pretty powerful, and it sucks to not get them; and sometimes other players make unwise plays that screw things up (the "Puerto Rico" factor, although much less problematic here). But it's all thematic, and the game wouldn't work without the uncertainty.
---
A note on the '=' (double auction) cards: there are several variations on how the '=' cards should be played when used alone. The main contenders are the original German (player who matches runs the auction and takes all the proceeds) and the Mayfair (player who matches runs the auction and splits the proceeds with the original player). In both cases, play proceeds to the left of the player who matched. After playing both ways many times, I've decided I significantly prefer the original German. With the Mayfair matching rules, there is little reason not to play an unmatched '=' as a fairly nasty screw-you play, and the resultant turn-skipping can be brutal for the players who are skipped. There isn't really an ideal solution here, unfortunately. With the German variant, playing an unmatched '=' is so strongly discouraged (outside of end-of-round situations) that the arbitrary turn-skipping should never be an issue.
--
Updated notes on the different editions:
- Arte Moderna (Matagot): This is my current favorite incarnation of the game - hits a nice sweet spot with a colorful, pleasing, and unified graphic design that still plays to the somewhat satirical aesthetic of the game itself. An unusual set in that it has good-quality money chits in sufficient quantity. 
- Modern Art (lautapelit.fi): This is another excellent set, with the art cards again playing to the satirical modern art aesthetic. Plus I like the smaller box size. The surrounding details though (screens, board, box) isn't great and isn't as unified. The artists are also not as nicely distinct and two of the colors are pretty close. As a Modern Art fanatic I'm really happy to have this one but it's not as nice as the Matagot or Hans-im-Glück editions.
- Stamps: If you can get me a copy of this so I can comment on it, please let me know :)
- Wargames Hong Kong edition: If you're a Modern Art completist, obvious you want this. Duh. The Chinese aesthetic is great. But it's hard to use for non-Chinese readers, with Chinese characters instead of iconography and suit colors that are used very sparingly, making them hard to distinguish. The art doesn't seem particularly modern, but it's very nice. Another set I'm glad to have but don't break out all that often.
- Original German (Hans-im-Gluck): In some ways this is still the best edition of the game, with nice money, nice cards, and a nice, if oversized, box.
- Original Mayfair: The more sensible box size is a plus, even if the money is a touch cheesy. I ordered a second set of chips (Mayfair sells parts) to make for enough change.
- Small-box Mayfair: This is a great, compact game, but the card quality seems to have suffered. For the price, though, you can't beat it.
- Brazilian Arte Mordera: This is Mike Doyle's rework. The edition is aesthetically wonderful, although there are a number of usability issues: the great international symbols for auction type have been replaced by letters, which are not that meaningful outside of Portugese. Cash is a bit short and not double-sided. And the quality of the overall production does not match the quality of the presentation: cards are modest-quality and hard to shuffle or deal, and the screens are a bit flimsy. It's still a great novelty set, but I wish the same attention paid to aesthetics had been paid to the ergonomics as well. Also, it bears mentioning that the lousy art in the original is part of the theme. Replacing lousy art with some nice art does seem to (IMHO) make the theme a little less compelling.

Great auction game!  Some fun in trying to predict the worth of the different artists, and a good bit of risk taking.  The different kinds of auctions also add an interesting element to the game... good stuff!

Players that are stingy deal-makers will do terribly here, as the game is all about getting in on deals, making money incrementally.  If you're always looking for the sweet end of a deal, you're going to fail hard.

The Doyle graphics of the Arte Moderna version take it a notch up for me!

Interesting bidding game in which players auction off modern art paintings and try to make the most profit. I'm usually not big on pure auction games but I like 5 five different bidding mechanisms spread across the various paintings. The scoring is also interesting in the way paintings are more valued if the artist has been selling a lot of pieces. The components are ok but I did like all different styles shown among the 5 artists. Not something I'd play all the time but I would like to revisit every now and then.

My favorite "light-medium" weight game although by "light-medium" I'm only referring to the rules complexity. This game is deep and plays very different from game to game. Yet despite it's depth, Modern Art sometimes feels like a party game. It's one of Knizia's most strongly themed games, making it fun for players to complain about the "nouveau riche" and to accuse each other of being philistines.

I've only played this with 3 and have really enjoyed it.  I would imagine that 4 and 5 players would be even better but I'm having fun just figuring out the strategies with 3. The game is criminally underrated on the Geek owing to the cult-of-the-new phenomena. It's been disappointing to see some of Knizia's elegant masterpieces be replaced by mechanically overloaded VP-builders for the 3-plays-and-done-set. I miss the days of simple, deep and elegant Euro's that could take one core mechanic (in the case of Modern Art, auctions) and squeeze every last drop of oomph out of the basic concept. I'm betting on the pendulum swinging back the other way as the power-gaming set realizes the hollowness of so many of the new-fangled Frankengames.

I love auction games, so having one game that combines multiple auction types is right up my alley. I really like how the players' actions determine the value of the paintings. Always have fun with this one. Truly there is no uglier game on face of the Earth, though. I would actually re-buy this game if a new edition came out with better art. I would pay for it all over again just to get rid of those horrific cards, it's THAT terrible.

Finally! A non-hideous version of a great auction game! True to my word all those years ago, I got a new version simply because it wasn't so hideous.

I always get the sense when playing Modern Art than it is cleverer than I will ever be. The way the value of items shifts in a way that's player driven, but guided by chance is fascinating. There's so many little things to consider on each turn - trying to set yourself up to end the round on YOUR terms, paying other players, bidding just to drive up the price for your opponents, etc. There's a lot going on in this game.

That said, I might enjoy thinking about the design of this game than I do actually playing it. Don't get me wrong - I thoroughly enjoy playing Modern Art, I just don't get the same kick from it that I do with Ra or Traumfabrik (or Dream Factory or whatever they decide to call it next). There's a little less angst, but possibly even more opportunity to feel incredibly clever.

Modern Art is the greatest game concept of human interaction and anticipation available.  Criticisms that loose play by newbies wrecks the experience is unfounded in my opinion.  All possible actions by players of all ability must be anticipated.  That is the reality of human nature and certainly the nature of the art world.If someone is generous enough to play Modern Art for the first time, only an ungracious egoist would complain that the newbie wrecked the game without whom there would be no game in the first place.

Tremendously fun game with simple mechanics.  Another game that reveals things after a few plays that you weren't aware of before.

Very dependent on the table dynamic.

It's true that the game is fragile with bad players potentially handing the game away. The same charges are often levied at Puerto Rico. Well, that can happen in highly interactive games that require a lot of skill to play well.

Clever auction game. Amusing if played in role (art critic / auctioneer / etc) with the right crowd. Considerably less fun if players are just doing maths throughout and complaining that someone threw the game by setting too low a price.

Seriously, how can this much quality gaming and so many potentially meaningful decisions be squeezed into such a short amount of time (45 min)? Surprising depth when played with experienced players. And yet it's easy to teach to newbies (even if they do throw the balance off for a few turns). 

My only gripe is the '=' cards, as their power determines so many games. We had experimenting with making sure everyone starts with an "=" card so that everyone has a chance for a bold play. Knowing everyone has at least one makes it a real question of timing big moves.

I'm not nuts about the production, but the game excels. The new version is soooo bleh. I love that the game is inexpensive, but it doesn't have to look cheap. Really, there needs to be a beautiful version of this game so that it stays a part of the gaming heirarchy. The design and raw auction goodness make this a classic on so many levels. I will not give this game the ten it deserves until the game is produced in the way it truly deserves.

1) Sense of wonder: Not much here as far as narrative or variability. You do see different cards and paintings each time, but that's about it. 

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  This is a strength of the game. Lots of meaningful choices throughout the game mostly on how much to bid.

3) Player interaction: For me auction games are always a hit for player interaction. I like the back and forth of figuring out how much someone is willing to pay and dropping paintings I don't want on them but making them pay big for them.

4) Components/artwork: 1The cards and tokens are good quality, but the art is terrible. Oh, the irony.

5) Game length/complexity:  perfect length game. Just when the game is feeling tense, the game ends. I like that about this game. It is also not too complex. Most people can pick it up easy, but as the players all get better the challenge of the game goes up.

RATING: 5
Rated 8 after one play. What a blast! I almost gave this a nine... but I want to play it a few more times to see how this holds up. I absolutely love the hodge podge of various auctions in the same game. And, I was surprised at how thematic the game felt. Our group kept cracking jokes about the new "hot artist." 

I know the game gets accused of having a transparent end game where you can "do the math." But, I'm not sure that complaint is totally valid. For one thing, there are times when you need to start the auction... and that turn order has a value of its own that might not be possible to straight calculate. I'm not sure... a few more plays will tell. For now, I'm very enthusiastic to try this again.

Whoops: prior to a 2nd play, I realized we played this wrong. Auctions occur in turn order, not the person who won the prior auction. That makes a big difference. I really like this game, but with the 2nd play, I observed a love it/hate it dynamic. Some people struggled understanding how to value paintings, and the "strategy" was totally lost on them. I, however, find the game fascinating.

Update: A third play, and I'm dropping this to a 7, where I expect it will stay. The game encourages mathy calculating, and you're essentially bidding/betting on which artists other players will emphasize ("gee... bob has a lot of green. Will he try to end it?"). That's fine, but this surely is a pure auction game. It's good, and I like how the game brings in different auction types, but maybe I like "auctions in games" better than a pure auction game. I'll always want to play Ra over this.

Update: traded this away in a math trade. Loved the mix of auction types, loved the theme of trading wacky modern paintings, but I just couldn't get past the fact that it's too easy to start calculating the value of a lot.

RATING: 6
Classic Knizia auction game where based on the card played that turn there can be 1 of 4 different auction types ranging from open bidding, closed reveal, once around the table, and set price. This game can be quite vicious with the auctions as that one painting you need could cost you a lot of money. A round ends when the 5th card is revealed for a particular artist and then the value of each artist is awarded based on which one has the most cards out that round. Sell your paintings and repeat that 3 more times and whoever has the most money wins! If you like auction games this is a great one, for me I'll stick with Isle of Skye or Biblios.

Although this is a classic, I don't know that I like it as much as other auction games, and I can't exactly pinpoint why.

It is absolutely packed full of auctiony goodness. All different types of auction are used. However, an auction game about auctioning stuff off at auction houses. Meh. The game components are quite ugly including the artworks themselves. Everything you auction is worth the same to each player and everybody knows pretty much the exact value of everything. A fantastic distillation of auction games but dry as a bone. 

I just played a game with everyone taking on the role of a snooty art dealer trying to flog their paintings. It was hilarious and improved the game considerabley.

If you love auctions, you're likely to love this game.  If you're neutral to the whole auction mechanic, you may well hate this title.

There's a lot to consider and this leads me to wonder, is there a deep, strategic element to the game . . . or is there just a lot of stuff going on and no real chance to make sense of it?  I'm not sure the title generates the interest necessary to play enough to answer the question either.

At any rate, quickly grew tired of the game and traded it.

The component quality (Mayfair edition) is criminally poor and doesn't justify the price.  I've been lucky enough to get a Hans im Glock version . . . sweet . . .

This is a game based on different kinds of auctions. You're a manager of an art gallery and you try to buy modern painting so you can sell them later for more money. The theme of the game is quite interesting but the paintings are rather ugly or maybe I don't understand moder art :)

There is a little luck involved but mostly you have to think and count how much you can pay for a painting and try to predict witch of the painter will be the most valuable.

You had to like auction bidding game !
   I can't play this game without " roleplay " trying to sell my new talent depincting the painting, playing to justify the increase of bidding by the necessity of New York to have " all the new knowned painters "
   The less in the game is the possibility allowed to each player to know the number of paintings remaining in game at the last turn, indicating a maximum prize on the market.
One more hateful thing is not to have double bidding cards cause you reap benefits in two orders: sell and buy with profit.
When, in one turn, you sell two paintings you have double sure income in your bank

Enjoyable auction game.  Interesting economic model, where money can flow around to others and enable them to bid higher for the auction.  Lots of the game seems to hinge on the timing of each auction.  Setting up a more valuable piece in your hand with another less valuable one.  Also, each type of auction seems to have timing associated with it as well.  Perhaps open auctions are better later, as they allow for more accurate valuation, while secret auctions are good to possibly steal something at a bargain.

Modern Art is a weird game. As a self-professed "hater" of most/all bidding games, I find Modern Art passable. However, it's still not a game that I will play every time its brought to the table; the variations of bidding will only occupy me for a limited amount of time, and after that, I find it useless and no different then hundreds of other imitators (except for the horribly ugly "art").

About 10 plays. I like it a lot. Need to play it more. Argh, why can't I?! And another question... When will a version with high quality cards come out?  I guess I should cheer for such a good game that is also so cheap.  (I don't quite see how this was designed as a game about dog racing.)  A Knizia Klassic. Update: I like both this and the newer Knizia game of similar title. This one is a better game I think, but the other one is more new-gamer friendly.

A really great and quick auction game. Each player auctions off 1 of 5 different artists, with 1 of 5 different auction types. The 3 most popular artists each season (of 4) are worth money at the end of the round. I love the fragile art values and different types of auctions. We felt like art dealers trying to pump up the table value of each artist we were invested in. Looking forward to more plays

The psychological and mathematical parts of this game combine into something unique, especially considering how simple it all is.  The only tough part is that the early game can be a bit flimsy, with such a great lack of information that it's hard to say what to expect, and new players can cause some chaos, but it's interesting chaos that keeps you on your toes.

Despite being able to recognize some of its faults, I find myself interested in playing this pretty much any time it's suggested.

Fantastic pure auction game. While the bidding currency is less interesting than Ra's (it's just the victory points) the different kinds of auctions and the decision of when to auction a certain piece, and what method is the best way to go is generally far from clear cut and makes this game very interesting. Do you try to finish the round now, or try to get greedy and make even more money in the process? Many small decisions add up to your final score. I would consider this very accessible given enough interest for casuals (short ruleset), but it definitely is heavy enough where an experienced player could mercilessly pound newbies at it (if they're any good at least, I can't win this game to save my life :) ), which means it has enough going on to be interesting to me.

This game is dependent on intelligent play, because the bidding system can get out of whack when someone is paying way too much for items (which then makes it a game of drawing the right cards as the person who sells the most pieces to that person is going to likely win...) but with the right group this is solid gold...coming up with the correct value for items is tricky, and the psychology of the auction in this game is second to none. I doubt a pure auction game will ever come along which does more things, in a more interesting way than this one.

I generally play with non-gamers.

I've only played about 15 times so far (with five different groups of people with my wife and I as the only constants).  I think people are intimidated by painting valuation even though they understand the mechanics.  If I can get a group of people to get over this hump, I think my rating for the game will improve.

Edit 12/14/07: I lowered this game's rating. It seems that this game suffers a lot with new people, or people that don't get it. Some incorrect bidding could quickly cost a new person his chance of victory, and sometimes the wild bidding of the new person plays like kingmaking, although I am sure they don't intend to.

I no longer own Modern Art because I stupidly gave it away. It is a wonderful, different game because it's the only game I've played with multiple types of auctions from which to choose. All you do is auction off paintings in the form of specialized colored cards, and the symbol on the card indicates the type of auction. You are auctioning off the painting to other players, so money changes hands among players rather than just the player and the bank. It's a great number-crunching, strategy game, but whatever you do, do NOT buy the card game version or the Masters Gallery or whatever other game related to Modern Art. STICK TO THIS ORIGINAL!

Superb! Modern Art has never let me down: it has always been a great experience. Although the rules are easy to pick up, it takes a game or two to understand how the game really works. However, knowing the mechanics is only half of the game. The other half is understanding other players and trying to manipulate them :devil: That is what makes the game 10 for me! 

The game is perhaps best with 4 but also plays well with 3 and 5. (Playing with 3 is quite another experience than playing with 5) It plays rather fast  - usually about 1,5 hours or less.

It seems to have some of the same problems that Acquire does. It seems that if you happen to want the same artists to succeed that other people do, that helps you, while if you're unlucky to want different artists to succeed, it can cost you. If you have a bad first season, then the rich-get-richer gameplay can leave you behind.

One of the best auction games if not the best.  My only gripe is the game can be rather fragile with new players having a particularly rough time figuring out how to best value the auctions leading so some very unsatisfying games.  But with a full complement of experienced players, the game really hums

An interesting auction game, with a wide variety of different auctions. It's a great game for assessing player behaviour in these auctions. The game is simple but there's a lot of depth, which I always like. There are some issues with the opening round, particularly with an inexperienced group, players can end up losing a lot of money on worthless art, and it can be difficult to recover from that. When explaining the game in future I'll probably do a dummy round before I start play so that it doesn't take people quite as much by surprise.

I really enjoy this game that features every kind of auction you can imagine.  A fascinating challenge in that you must balance using your only resource to get more of the same resource.

Please consider this and believe in me before you are willing to have one.
This is an auction game with various method. In fact, no matter the method is, the bidding price is majorly depending on the valuation. Then it is important to add make the valuation not so certain but however the game mechanism fails. Turns out the bidding prices will go to some range that I can get benefit and the player playing the card is earning an amount of money not so different from me. In conclusion, a money splitting game. And there is no way to prevent the leading player to earn money when you want to earn too. How about forming an alliance by playing new cards to change the valuation? It is much more risky and earning easy safety money. Someone who first must earn less.
If you enjoy a long time, monotonic money splitting game, try this! Enjoy an game that you know you are losing due to some random stuffs and snowball not later than the half of the time.

I love the way the different types of auction dynamics play out, as well as the psychology of getting certain artists more or less valued. I'm less fond of the impact of double-auctions; I like the notion of making sure everyone gets equal numbers of them.

(It does makes me sad when someone grossly overbids for something and determines the victor thereby, but I don't feel that reflects poorly on the game itself.)

Great auction game...I played RA also and even though I'm a sucker for egyptian lore and themes I must say this one surpases it by far(even though RA is quoted better). the 5 different bidding mechanics really bring diversity and you really need to know when to bid and went to back out of an auction as one mistake might cost you a lot of money :). It's a good idea to focus on a few painters than try to invest in too many as round end might see you with too few of the most known 3 artists...but it is also good idea to maybe invest in an artist no one shows interest in as you can push him ahead of the others and gain more money in the long run.

Love it :D.....new people seem to enjoy it also.

Production: Though it is a nice touch to have artists each represented by multiple, unique paintings, in general I find the card illustrations to be vomitously ugly.  Play: I enjoy that different auction types are getting tossed around, and that players collude with each other to make each other's art more valuable.  The worth of items can be relatively easy to predict, as each round unfolds, yet a player's choices can be seriously limited due to cards available, turn order, and whether one wants to pay to or buy from the leader.  (1+0+2) (2 plays)

Nice auction game. Easy to teach and lots of interaction. The double paintings may be too powerful. If you're not dealt a double, you're at a disadvantage. I love the way the value of the paintings is decided. The more that sell, the more that artist's paintings are worth. I wish they'd spent a little more time making the paintings more interesting, but I guess a lot of the humor is that the paintings have no intrinsic value.

New version from CMON on my shelf (superb component quality), and my own custom-designed, print-and-play version as well (see https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25625985#25625985). 

Instead of five individual artists, I designed the art cards to feature artworks from the 16th–20th centuries available from the Met Museum's 350,000 free-to-use image library. I use black 8mm cubes to mark the end of round prices on a game board, and printed my cards with Drive Thru Cards on premium 320gsm black-core card stock.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A clever art auction game with beautiful components and an appealing playtime (~60 minutes) give its depth. The use of four different kinds of auctions within a single game and the appreciation of certain artists' work as the game progresses is absolutely inspired. The use of real artists and the designer's encouragement to actually "pitch" the art up for auction encourage a cultural dialogue that is (unfortunately) rare outside of a historical war game.

My primary complaint is that often the objective "value" of a piece of art up for auction is too obvious, which makes the auctions less dynamic, fails to reward risk-taking, and overly mathematical. I wonder what the game would look like if all art weren't sold until the very end of the game, rather than at the end of each round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Starting to think this game is underrated. The rules are simple, playtime is short, and there is a healthy amount of strategy that doesn't come coupled with too much AP. And surprisingly for a Knizia game, the mechanics fit the theme quite well.

Seeing this relegated to below rank 100 (behind even an admittedly broken game like A Few Acres of Snow) is sure evidence that no one should care about BBG's rankings.

Brilliant auction game.

The balance of open and hidden information is superb - enough revealed for folk to make meaningful decisions with enough hidden information to provide both an exciting aura of suspense and a feeling of being 'in the know', whilst stopping it from being too dry and mathematical.

At its heart, it remains a mathematical game with a theme that could either be ignored or used for a side-serving of silliness.

As Ian pointed out, to widen a lead you must get 100% profit from a purchase - otherwise you give them more then you gain yourself. Thinking more, I now realise that if you buy from yourself, you're losing twice that amount. I think the same calculation could probably be made but it's even more important to not buy unless you make 100% profit.

I was definitely overvaluing the purchases.

Enjoyed the game though, despite losing.

I really enjoy this game, it has quite a bit going on with the different auction mechanisms and with how the prices of the paintings can vary based on who chooses to sell them.  There is a fair bit of bluffing involved, something I usually enjoy in a game.

The only problem is that the cards themselves are physically painful to look at.  Not even just the artwork itself, which would be fine, but the background colors were poorly chosen, and just about everything about the cards clashes with everything else.

This is a good game, but the game isn't where people think it is. The game is not in getting deals. It's not in buying low and selling high. It's a game of what to sell and when. The auctions should provide the same basic result: as players become more skilled, they will tend toward optimal bidding strategies aimed at upping the price of art at the expense of other players' relative gain. That means that art is - generally - worth just under its probable sale price at auction. The profits of the auctioneer thus approach the deterministic.

Never buy your own painting, unless you are trying to drive up the price or it's insanely underpriced. The strategy lies in what to sell, not what you buy.

RATING: 5
The fun theme is enough to get me over my basic lack of excitement for all-auction games; this is then canceled out by the bizarre interpretation of the theme.  Art museums don't de-accession works to wheel and deal on the open market!!!  Sigh...

Anyway, it's well-structured and unfolds nicely, and the way artists accumulate value from turn to turn and round to round gives you enough variables to juggle that each auction is interesting to weigh out and gamble on.

Negatives: I&#039;m terrible at this game, and it&#039;s too dependent on other players. A new player who doesn&#039;t pick up strategies quickly can destroy the game and make it essentially random.

A pure auction game with the added touch of class by good old Reiner. How can such simple rules lead to such a wonderful game, I'll probably never understand.  This is the type of game that at the beginning one is usually completely hopeless at, and then only slowly starts realizing the depth and finesse, until the jaw suddenly drops in awe of such an elegant creation. Excellent game, and I generally don't even like auctions.

I used to think this was the most brilliant game EVAR!  So simple and yet so complex.  Now I think it is more chaotic than complex (meaning, the other players add so much randomness into the game that you can't really plan as well as I would like).

It's still a great game, but there too many types of auctions (in other words, too many rules) for the amount of control I get in the game.

Interesting and mind wrestling betting concept.

I never was able to pull this one out for some reason (same with Bohnanza).

So there must be something I need to learn in negotiations still !

Awesome speculation economy sim.  Really fun trying to sell your auctions like a used car salesman.  Not a nine because of the double card.  You get money by being involved in deals for paintings.  People who are dealt Double cards are involved in more deals.  That's kinda unfair.

Update 7-4: Once you get thinking about the math you realize the game is cute but broken.  If I win that painting it is worth 0 because I can't close it out.  If you win that painting it is worth $200,000.  There is nothing I can do now or later to change that.  Just doesn't work as an economy game.

I'm an auction games nut and this is the best one around.  Players auction and purchase art from the various hands of the players and generally speculate on what artist will be the most popular this round.  Payoffs are made at the end of each round for art bought, but the clever money is won (and lost) during the auctions themselves.  Brilliant game.

Deep and calculating auction game, where values are wide-open for the paintings. Initial playing makes me wonder if the double-auction cards are overly powerful though. Look forward to more plays to explore the game with my group. Desite its status as "The Original Auction Game", I think it is not nearly as good as Taj Mahal or Fabrik der Traum.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Sé que mucha gente no lo considera como tal, pero si tuviese que elegir el mejor juego de iniciación escogería el Modern Art sin dudarlo: es fácil de explicar y jugar (después de todo, ¿quién no sabe lo que es una subasta?), sus partidas tienen una duración bastante discreta (50-60 min) y el tema no desagradará absolutamente a nadie (venta de cuadros... creo que es uno de los temas más serios y no-frikis que he visto).

Pero a parte de poder sacárselo a cualquiera, el Modern Art tiene la virtud de ser más profundo de lo que parece a simple vista: si eres un hacha de la economía quizás sepas pillar todas sus estrategias en la primera partida, pero lo normal es que vayas descubriéndolas según juegas (por algo es de Reiner Knizia).

En resumen, es un juego tremendamente disfrutable, con menos azar del que sugiere (en el fondo no importa tanto los cuadros que te toquen, sino el provecho que sepas sacarles), y con una rejugabilidad bastante aceptable (a ver, si lo sacas todos los días lo acabarás quemando, pero es de estos que te puede apetecer echar "la revancha").

Very good auction game - I love all the varied types of auctions as well as the valuation system.  However, I find the bidding process difficult - it's very mathy to come up with just the right value, and one person who miscalculates badly can throw the game off.  The card game edition does most of the good stuff while eliminating the tricky money component!

Modern Art is an auction game.  It is quick moving game where you buy and sell art and attempt to make the most money.  You hide your money behind a screen, so you don't really have a good idea on who is winning until the end.  The value of the artist changes each round depending upon its popularity.  The game mechanics play really well, but the artwork is less than desirable.

It takes a round to grasp the depth of strategy, but even after a "costly" mistake (pun intended), I still managed to secure 3rd place in a 4 player game.  I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  Ra is still my preferred Knizia auction game.

Another of those games that "took over" for a long time, like Power Grid, and Ohne Furcht und Adel, when we started playing it, but it wears out a little faster than those games. Can be frustrating with beginners that unknowingly give the victory to another player (fixed price auction).

RATING: 6
Easy to see why beginners have to be careful about how much they are bidding, because some of that money is going to help the seller.  Neat how many different auctions are thrown in the game.   Role-playing it up helps spice it up, but I would expect that to get old fast.

If you like auction games, that ONLY contain auctions, this is the one. It's always seemed straightforward to me, buy low and sell high, but optimizing your profit is what makes it challenging. Make sure you use our house rule, "all pieces of artwork must be named before it can be auctioned."

Love the different auction types in this game, but the components look like crap. Ironic that a game about art has really shitty artwork. Even the colors are horrible.  The artwork is so bad in fact, it bothers me every time I see it, and I refuse to play it ever again until I customize it.  Working on creating my own art for the game.  Once I finish my cards, I think this will jump to one of my most favorite games. I'm a sucker for a good auction game for reasons I cannot explain. Add good components and it's a winner in my book. Traded in a math trade for Imperial Settlers.

Very fun auction game. The only pure auction game I know, where you are actually bidding with victory points. In other auction games, the money aren't worth points at the end. Also unlike other games, the players don't just bid, they also do the auctioning. 

Very special game, with a very subtle (perhaps counterintuitive) strategy.

This is one of those Very Popular Games whose popularity complete escapes me.  I love auction games but hated this one.

Boring sounding theme, but a great game for several reasons.

1. The variety of auctions makes every turn unique with little downtime. Every player has the chance to do something on his turn.
2. Non-gamers seem to like this game, the rules are well-written and intuative. 
3. The dynamics of the game change throughout the auctioning seasons. 
4. The end of the game frequently holds surprises- one never knows how much money his opponents holdds.

An auction game with numerous varieties of auctions within the game. 

The game is great to look at, easy to learn and play. The way different artists pay out throughout the game is an interesting mechanic to the game that keeps you always looking to the future. There's more to this game that it initially leads on. I'm looking forward to playing again and potentially raising my rating. The only thing keeping this game from being a higher rating is its auctions and math and auctions and math...despite loving auctions (which is one of my favorite mechanics) I prefer them to be attached to something else like turn order, board states, etc. Otherwise, lots of stuff to like here.

MOst fun with accents. You'll need to bid only what you can make a strong profit on withOUT giving too much to another player. If you bid 50k and it's worth 70k, you've made 20k, but the other player has made that 50k. Once that math is discovered, you need to play with more than three people.

I really enjoy the game mechanics in Modern Art. There are lots of different possible auctions. Not everybody I know likes this game. I guess it depends if your into auctions or not. It's simple, and doesn`t have a lot of game material.

The more the game advances, some paintings of same artist can be worth a lot to some sellers for a nice profit. I find it to be quite an intense game in the 3rd and 4th round of the game. The more intense it gets, the more I enjoy playing Modern Art.

Having good judgement from how much you want to spend when buying a painting and how much you are willing to depart one of your own paintings can be critial between a 1st or 2nd place. You the look at each painting is worth in every round.

I've been on a winning streak at this game lately. In my last game I won, in the second year, I manage to get zero income from buying other players paintings. I guess I wasn't a big buyer and more of a seller in that game. Sell paintings at high cost and buy them cheap as possible to win!

Another fantastic Knizia game. 

This game is pure player interaction - how could it not be? It's just auctions all the way through. But what is really interesting is how there is deep strategy embedded in the decisions of which art pieces to auction off at which point. 

Like many other Knizia games, this one also has the player screens to keep your cards and money tokens hidden from other players. This small piece of cardboard has been the source of many dramatic moments - one more than one occasion, the winner ended up being someone that the rest of us did not expect. The game has dramatic finishes in spades.

If you like auctions, then this is the game for you!  Not only are there auctions, but there are multiple types of auctions, such as blind-bidding, once around the table, free form, and selling things at a set price.  I find it interesting to watch as different artists get more and more valuable as many of them become sold.  The strategy wasn't easy for me on the first game and there is a lot of planning based on what you have in your hand.  I still think that Ra is Knizia's quintessential auction game but this one is really worth trying as well.  It's a shame that the best looking editions of this game aren't released in North America. Spiteful/newbie players can knowingly/unknowingly hand the game to other players. While I haven't really experienced it, it's certainly worth mentioning.

I was disappointed by Modern Art. 
-In many of the auctions, that value of the paintings is fairly accurately known by all players. In these cases the auctioneer receives most of the value.
-In other auctions, 1 player has info the other players don’t, and he gets the painting cheap.
-Only a small minority of the auctions have some of the tension I was expecting: Should you risk over paying or risk letting another player get the painting too cheaply.

I suck at this game but still enjoy it, although not as much as Ra, Traumfabrik, or Medici.

You must count quite a bit, but they are very simple numbers.

Very nice auction game. Theme is pasted on but doesn't detract at all from the gameplay. Only gripe is the quality of the artwork which is quite frankly horrible. The game plays quick enough to play more than once but is deep enough to act as more than a filler.

Pitch-perfect combination of math, economics, and psychology.  And a great simulation of the theme.

I played a game where three of five had no idea what they were doing and made ridiculous bids.  Rather than ruin the game, it just enhanced it - it was the playing out of an illogically overheated art market, and it was fascinating for the two of us to figure out how best to take advantage of that market.

Need to check out some of the freeware software which illustrates this game.  Auction game, superior in game play to For Sale (which is more a filler game).  Definitely want to get this one some time, given the high praise for it.  Ra is apparently a good alternative auction game to Modern Art, although I already have Razzia.  Most regard Ra as more fun than Modern Art, but see Modern Art as a better "game".  Note there are [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/445487]different editions[/url] of this game, with different artwork.

First play at Origins 2017 from CABS library.  I like Knizia's games for the most part and this one is no exception.  I love bidding as well (even though I'm terrible at it).  This one might be higher ranked if it didn't feel like one player can get ahead and then just outbid everyone to stay ahead.  Although maybe I didn't do a good enough job evaluating how much a piece of art costs to buy vs how much it robs an opponent.

This is a game that Gare likes a lot.  I am very bad at action games  (For example, I think the last time I played RA, I ended up with 5 points to everyone elses 30+++).  I never seem to end up with any paintings (or tiles, or whatever is being auctioned).

We played this for the first time and although I enjoyed it, my brother HATED it. He complained that he couldn't get any decent artists into his hand. And it does seem that if you are lucky enough to draw an artist that had a great season last phase, you're able to sell their paintings for more this period. Perhaps I missed something in the rules there... All I know is that I had a lot of fun with the auctions, found the basic game to be quite simple to learn, and in all would be happy to pull this out to play with most any crowd.

Update: Oddly, we never pulled this out again, so to clear space, I sold it. I'm sure this will make some new family very happy. Farewell, Modern Art.

> My wife hates this game like no other game.
> My gaming group has stuck into group think. We all know that paintings of Carl Gitter have been very valuable in all sessions this far. Therefore, Gitter paintings _will_ be very valuable. An outsider once played the game with us. He was a competent Modern Art player; still he lost clearly. Reason: he did not know the value of Gitter paintings in our group.
- At best with five players. Ok with four. Not so much with three.

(3-5 players) Way too math-y to be any fun. Constant struggle to evaluate expected value of artworks based on current value, what's in play, and what's in your hand.

I now prefer the simplified Masters Gallery version which removes the auctions.

One of the best pure game designs. Can be played as a not-too-complex, fun bidding game with non-gamers. Yet can be played as a tense bidding challenge with serious gamers. Deserves a higher rating, but appeal has worn off because for me the exploration and building games are much more fun.

Tense bidding game.  Players are faced with tough choices on what the exact bid should be (some hard number crunching involved).  Plays best with experienced players as the game suffers with someone who doesn't fully understand the mathematics of it.

Probably one of the best auction games ever. What can more I tell ? 'nuff said. The Matagot edition is gorgeous, probably the best edition. You might prefer the hideous art of the roiginal edition which had a kind of, in the check humour. However this french edition provides  classy and witty easter eggs in both the styles and names of the artists. Great if you got any "arty" poseur in your entourage, he'll be able to recognize the pâte of each artist (yes, I do use french words; but do not believe that I'm some snobby posh hipster, I'm much worse than that. I'm parisien). Further, if you happen to be fluent in french, and if you like the same kind of "calembour" as I do, spend some time trying to figure out the names of the artists. Hu-hu-hu.

Multiple types of auctions and items of uncertain value; to me this was a very different game to what I'm used to.

Duration: This took a while, but there were always choices and bids to make.
Design: Simple and straightforward rules and mechanics, but lots of depth, especially with many players and hidden money.
Strategy: There's one level of strategy in deciding whether to purchase something, and another in trying to put out works for auction.
Components: Decent cards and counters.
Theme: On one level this is an abstract, but I thought it fit well.

Good, tense and simple.  This game puts a huge amount of pressure on me every single turn to not screw up a bid.  I like it but it feels very tense.   In my opinion it's a fairly heavy game.  It needs to be played well and tight.  Ra feels breezy and light compared to Modern Art.

[Auction, Art, Prisoner's Dilemma] {5P:7, 4P:8, 3P:4} A deliciously complex bidding game, as one might expect from THE designer with a doctorate in mathematics, RK. The varying auction modes are maddening. Will clearly get better with more plays. *** Update: Now that I finally own this sucker, and am getting to play it more, it's clearly better than initially thought. Rating up to 8. Thanks for the reprint, Mayfair! *** UPDATE: Ok, this is now a nine, partly because I can't figure it out, partly because I can't win, and partly because I truly believe I should be able to figure it out and yet can't. Welcome to the demigods, Modern Art, I'm glad I go to know you this intimately. Now in the same exclusive class as Taj Mahal - "Games Fawkes Sucks At But Loves Anyway" *** UPDATE: Now I understand you Modern Art, and I understand your greatness. You don't feel like a 10, because there's not enough going on, but for a non-heavy game, I think you're as good as it ever gets. 9.5, and if you're still played as heavily in a year as you are now, then I'll be able to make you a 10. *** UPDATE: Back to 8.5, burning out (might not be the game's fault tho). Or rather, I think I'll now settle on an 8. MA is an exercise in Game Theory with incomplete information, in an almost-pure form. My group is playing very, very loose, and is creating runaway winners. The lack of depth shows in this case, as there are no other roads to victory, and no way to mitigate the looseness of the bids. *** UPDATE: Well, Modern Art's weakness is found in the 'weak/greedy player syndrome' that screws games. I think that part of my frustration is that I can see the game theory effects clearly as the game is going, and am frustrated by loose play. Modern Art remains an excellent game, but the frustration takes its toll. Am still glad I own it, and would still recommend it to anyone. If you know any game theory, keep your cool. =P ***UPDATE: Modern Art doesn't work well with 3P. It's ok with 5, but like many other German games it's best with 4 due to the added control.

My first two plays were asterisk games, since we didn't realize that the fifth card auctioned counted towards the number of paintings sold.  That changed the dynamic a lot!  I really like this game, and I suspect there is more to learn.  Simple rules, but a lot of depth: this game could follow Acquire as one of my favorites.  

The path to victory is clearer in this game than Acquire.  Acquire has more finesse, whereas this game feels more like wrestling.  There seems to be more control in Modern Art than in most other games.  Much of that is due to the length of play.  It clocks at 45 minutes, but I suspect that players who are familiar with it could play faster.

But after three plays, what do I know?

Fantastic game about demand and supply of art. 

+ Finding the balance between demand and supply is always a thrill in Modern Art.  
+ Players can pitch their art and use a several auction mechanisms to maximize their profit.

Dec. 2011: the game is a succession of auction. I had the impression that it has a runaway leader problem (the more money you have, the more you can bit (therefore preventing other players to win needed cards).

Não é o meu gênero mas um é ótimo jogo de leilão. Nós somos leiloeiro de grandes museus do mundo e temos em nossas mãos obras de arte para leiloar. Estas obras caso sejam postas em leilão podem ser adquiridas por qualquer jogador inclusive o próprio leiloeiro. O jogo ocorre em quatro temporadas (turnos). São leiloadas várias obras de modo que o 1º, 2º e 3º artista mais popular, ao final de cada uma das temporadas, tem suas obras avaliadas em 30, 20 ou 10 mil, respectivamente, e quem adquiriu obras destes três artistas se capitalizam para as temporadas futuras. O interessante é que você pode adquirir obras que não estarão entre as três mais populares, por tanto não terá valor algum naquela temporada, e obras que estarão entre as três mais populares e estarão valorizadas. Esta valorização é acumulativa. O ponto alto do jogo são os 5 tipos de leilão, aberto, fechado, lance único, preço fixo e duplo, que dão uma dinâmica bem divertida ao jogo. O dinheiro adquirido no final das temporadas e na venda das obras de arte define quem vence. Faço questão de destacar a qualidade da versão brasileira, da Odysseia jogos. A qualidade dos materiais, a arte, a caixa, o manual e o certificado de autenticidade da edição com nº da unidade dão uma aula de como produzir um jogo. É perfeita. Recomendo!

RATING: 7
It's good...stripped down auction game with a variety of auctions.  Although I hear people say "this is better than Ra", I still don't see it.  I could see someone possibly liking this as much as Ra, but not saying this is absolutely "better".  Ra is an auction game stripped to its most elemental; this is a bridge too far in that despite its additional auction types, this is stripped down TOO far, and the bones show.  You manipulate stuff by playing cards from hand, trying to gauge prices.  It just feels more like a gamey little card game.  A good one...but I know Ra, and you, sir, are no Ra.

I'm not that much into auction games I think, but I love this one. All the different auction types are agreat idea that brings a lot of variety to the gameplay, and the choice of cards to play is engaging and deep enough. Simple rules once you've explained the scoring, and it's fun to play galleries and art buyers and make up comments about the works to better sell them. Also, this game leads to sometimes completely irrational group behaviours and I find it fascinating.

A classic bidding game.  I thought there was a "formula", but have been whipped by neaophytes occasionally - which keeps things interesting.  I played this last with people that could speak very little English - the fact there is little text makes it miltilingual - provided you can understand each others bids ...

Smart! One of Knizia's earliest auction games and yet so much what a lover of auction games is looking for. I like this genre of games quite a bit and this one has 5 different auction mechanics! Perfect theme integration too for a game like this - I really feel like I'm driving up the prices of new artists, trying to influence the art market and such. I wish that the fake artists had better art, but this game is so damn genius. Just a whole lot of fun.

Fun and rollicking good times. Again with Knizia games the math-heads will love it - calculating and scheming. I put this on par with Ra.
Unfortunately this game is BUTT UGLY, It's seriously the worst looking and most cheaply made game in my collection - Urgh! It is so bad it's likely to turn off potential players with its Fugliness. Like eating a 5 star meal in a dumpster.

 A good game. A game that maybe deserving of its high rating, however, I think this game more than most really needs experienced players who can understand the values, and make the correct calculations intuitively.  My experience for the most, has been introducing this to new players which creates an unbalanced game. This drawback prevents me from being able to truly appreciate what is supposed to be there. 


UPDATE: I may understand why people consider this the most pure of auction games, but it just doesn't grab me.  I can't place my finger on it, but Modern Art is a game I wouldn't miss if never played again.  Rating dropped from 6.5 to 5.5

UPDATE:  Just confirming my previous update, Modern Art just doesn't find anyway to compel me to play.  I designed new screens for this title (after feeling ripped off from Mayfair's production), and still I couldn't sink my teeth into it. Lowering rating a further half point to a 5.

Simple rules but a whole lot of fun.  The tension builds as the payoffs increase.  There is a cadence to the game and the more people get into the idea of buying and selling paintings (i.e. role-playing) the more fun the game gets.  It is certainly not a game for everyone, as determining value of the art can either be an exercise in frustration or can be completely blown apart by one person that "doesn't get it".  However, it plays quickly, and so your done soon enough.

A game that I don't own, but resides out my house.

A (mechanically) simple auction game which nevertheless makes analysis difficult.  Not only do you have to weigh the value of each card in this round and later rounds, you have to decide how much you can should pay every auction to profit from being part of the deal but not unduly rewarding the auctioneer.  It's a tightrope I've never managed to navigate well.

After one game. The different auctions became clear to us soon after we started playing, as well as some emerging strategies. A lot of fun, and the group all said they liked the game, wanted to keep it.

Update: Just a solid, fun auction game. I can see why it's considered a classic. It also helps that I have the Nordic edition (with better art/components) and that I've upgraded with miniature easels, a gavel, and metal coins.

Auction-based game mechanics, distilled to their purest form.  A good Modern Art strategy continues to elude me, which speaks to the mathematical depth of the game.

Also very portable, which is a big plus.

Finally played it!  Though after only a game and a half (the first game we had to restart because we goofed), I love it!  It could be my new favorite game!  Far more depth than meets the eye!  Not only do you have to worry about owning highly sought after art each round, you also have to be concerned about who is making all the profit before the "profit taking" phase each round!  I can see those who has photographic memory with regards to math would have an "unfair" advantage in this game...  But hey, it's fun!  It's fairly light, and very easy to learn and to teach.  Highly recommend it!  BTW, this game I find to be far more enjoyable than Ra!  It's for the simple fact that I find it not nearly as frustrating each round, and because the results are mostly hidden, it gives you a sense that you are still in the game the whole time. 

Finally won my first game after 3 tries!  Rating drops a tad because the urgency to play this again is slightly lower...

The ultimate bidding game. If there is something that makes bidding in games interesting and fun - it's in 'Modern Art'. And although the rules can be grasped even by the beginner the game requires much thought and the experienced player almost always wins.

My complaint is the graphics - with a little bit more effort the game could have been stunning and is just nice.

Nevertheless play it - one of the best games in this genre.

An okay auction game, where you have to plan your actions carefully, but also adjust to the things other players are doing. What ruins it for me is being able to calculate the potential value of each trade too exactly after a few plays. I also don't enjoy the slight feeling of powerlessness: after the game you are not always sure how much you affected your final position. That's why I prefer Ra.

Homemade "Modern Tarot" using Thoth Tarot deck.

That I waited this long to get this to the table is lamentable. But the right group of four finally saw this one getting played, and while the the value and significance of the first few items up for auction was totally opaque, we all honed in on the strategy before the first round came to a close. Magnificent, this game. And though it appears to be an extra dry value computation exercise, it lends itself wonderfully to trashy table talk.

It's a very simple auction game with the quirk of letting the auctioneer pay the bank to buy from themselves as well as adding some hand management. As all games of its ilk it's rather fragile if someone plays weirdly. It's a fun game, I like that there's many different kinds of auctions so it doesn't get stale even though that's all you do. The artwork is of course great and I like the money tokens.

This is a game that, when you explain it, sounds pretty dry. But the player interaction that comes with all these different types of auctions is incredible! It also really makes you struggle to figure out valuation and how you can manipulate the season's market to get the most out of your bought paintings. 

I probably like Ra just a little bit better because of the (admittedly pointless!) theme and the weirdness of it. But Modern Art is a close second. Plus, the GeGe Co version is a work of art in and of itself.

Without question, one of the classics of the auction genre. It's a game that initially appeared to me to be rather straightforward, but experience revealed an amazing amount of depth and subtlety.  Modern Art is a great example of Knizia's underrated ability to convey the correct theme within a sparse, abstract game design (other examples include Euphrat & Tigris, En Garde, LoTR: the Confrontation, and Royal Turf).  I prefer to play with a variant that evenly distributes the "double" cards.  (For example, with four players, everyone gets two doubles in the opening hand and one more in the second batch of cards.)

This is a game that reveals itself in a subtle way, and for that reason I find it hard to teach to people. I managed to get my mother to play, thinking it would be a great game for after Sunday lunch. She was fine, but my dad balked, which is frustrating, because he loves a good auction. The buying and selling of the paintings at the right times for the right amounts, becomes a real skill, negating much of the luck factor. The main luck being what cards you are initially dealt. But even then you can play to the strengths of that hand. There is a definite learning curve in that respect, making it pretty much impossible for a newbie to beat an experienced player. Having said that, my mother kept winning because she would end auction rounds quickly, as soon as she saw she would make the most profit. That's too easy to do. I think the true spirit of the game is found by cautiously buying and selling as many paintings as possible and ending it at a tactical point whereby you make as much profit as possible and not too much for everybody else, whilst keeping an eye on your cards for the next round. Ending all the rounds quickly the moment you see your advantage makes for a quick, but unsatisfying game I believe. We play this with 4 in under 45 minutes, if mom isn't playing!

I did enjoy this game more than I thought I would after playing a computer version. However, the impact that poor play can make on the game is simply overwhelming. You must play like your group or you have no chance. For my group that has always been, sell expensive artists to gain high returns on your own auctions. Sometimes there is only 1 painting from a third painter and rarely are there paintings auctioned that don't score. Large influence by Group-play has really diminished my view of this game and it almost never gets to the table.

RATING: 7.1
I liked this one. It's solid and fun. I don't love the art, but it's called "modern art" so it is what it is. The various types of auctions are cool, but the variable round length takes a bit to get used to and makes it a bit hard to properly value the various pieces of art. You may think you have time to get more works out there to influence values when you don't. If you embrace that randomness, it will work wonders for you. If you don't (like me), it becomes a game that's worth playing, but not buying.

RATING: 7.5
Four plays. An intense and interesting game. It can be a fun and rambunctious one too, if there is heckling and cajoling during the bidding. I feel like it's a bit too wide open, though; in Knizia's later auction games there is much less currency in the economy, so a bid is going to be "3" or "11" and not "67" or "89". Modern Art can get pretty drawn out for this reason, and also just because there is a ton to think about.

A masterclass in auctions by Reiner Knizia. The game uses four different types of auctions and the choice of when to use them is the key to success.
The rules seem fairly simple but they really open the game for the players to make interesting choices. 
The beating heart of this game is not the auctions though, but the scoring system. It's really clever how the artists' popularity changes the painting's value, and how they change over time.
By far the best auction game I've ever played.

After playing, I realized that I think this is secretly a negotiation game: if I am auctioning a piece that will be worth 80, then those 80 points will be split between me and the high bidder and the only question is how we split them.

There's still gameplay in reading people and in the timing of card plays, seemingly enough to overcome my dislike of negotiation. Plus there's something beautiful about the design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Despite the underwhelming components (I have the older Mayfair edition) this is a stunning example of game design.  Rules are relatively simple but the game is complex.  It is highly inclusive: young, old, boy, girl, gamer, non-gamer, can all enjoy the experience in the same place at the same time.  And the 'cherry on top' is the role playing element (optional) which always enhances our playing experience.

Note.  Just bought the new CMON edition.  Will it be a 10?  
Edit: No.  They forgot to put the icon explanations on the inside of the 'art houses',  leading to much passing of the rule book.

There's nothing "flashy" about Modern Art, there's no mechanism that stands out as especially clever, and reading the rules is likely to leave you thinking "is that all there is?"

Modern Art is an excellent, but fragile auction game. The quality of the game will depend on each person's choices. At first, it is difficult to determine when to set the market, bluff investments, or end the round. Unfortunately, a poor decision here can affect the market or end the round with no real benefit.

For what the game does well, Modern Art has an engaging market mechanic. It sets itself apart from other auction games because you get to determine the value of your artwork collected. This is a deep and rewarding game that reveals itself after multiple plays.

Let's hope your group can do some role-playing as they present the pieces, makes for a much more entertaining experience.

Pure auction game that works pretty well, covering all the most common types of auctions. However, I feel the double auction cards are too powerful and there is little you can do if a lucky player gets most of them or you don't get any. There is also a significant kingmaking potential. And I must mention that the artwork is absolutely the WORST I've ever seen in a card game - and it's even worse if you consider that this game has an ART theme. I imagine the idea was to show how bad the real stuff is, but that's no excuse. The Brazilian edition corrected that problem, although Mike Doyle's art isn't particularly beautiful.

A perfect game.  That's not to say it's the best game ever, or even the most fun (though it is very, very fun); it's perfect in the way a crystal's molecular structure is perfect.

Auctions stripped down to the barest essentials. Brilliant design, but doesn't quite do it for me; I prefer Ra as a "pure" auction game, even though it's a lot less pure. Modern Art's economy is also extremely fragile; even a couple of misplays can ruin the entire game, handing it to someone arbitrarily.

RATING: 5
This was fun, but didn't live up to its hype as a great auction game.  The fact that it require 4-5 players hurts it too.  The different auction types and all the symbols are a little off-putting to casual gamers.  I felt like it was For Sale with crap added that didn't make the game any better.  The components disappointed me a little bit and the game was too dry for how long it was.  The system for determining how much the paintings were worth was very good, and the dynamics whereby you can end the round add tension and some interesting decisions.  I felt that buying up as many of the "winning" artist's paintings as possible was the best strategy, even if they were bought for expected value minus one.  I think my mistake was, I was always trying to close the auction once I had done that, when I should have been selling paintings instead.  I definitely want to play this again because I think I would do better and see more of the meat of the game on a second play. 

 I'd like to play it again, but I don't think I'll ever really like it.  The different auctions are too complicated to play with non-gamers and if I am going to play a gamer's game, there are a lot of other games I'd rather play.

This is an auction game for people who really love auction games. It's simple to grasp, but the implications of the choices you make are extremely deep and subtle. Not only will you be required to place bids (along with the valuation skill that requires), you will make choices about what TYPE of auction to initiate, with the turn order sometimes making a big difference. As the game progresses, it becomes clearer which artists will grant the biggest payoffs, meaning that the start of the game gives a bit more wiggle-room for errors as the players get a feel for it. There are lots of subtle skills that only become clear with several plays. A really enjoyable experience.

I really enjoy many of Knizia's auction games, but this one just didn't click for me. It felt like your success was largely determined by the moves of the other players, all of which are far out of your control. Sometimes your stuff skyrockets and other times you end up with junk.

RATING: 9
This game is very intuitively obvious even to complete newbies to gaming, but it's quite deep and has lots of replayability.  Prices of art are somewhat based on groupthink, so you have to adjust your strategy to the group that you're playing with.

Some say that the "right" price for a painting is about 2/3 of its value.  That is, if the painting will be worth $30 at the end of the round, you should pay $20, because then you lose $10 (net) to the seller, but make $10 on everybody else.  Of course, you never know what the true value of a painting is until the round is over (although that if 4 Lite Metals have been auctioned in a round, they will place at least second in that round).

It's clear that you can make more money by buying paintings than by selling them.  Remember -- you only get one chance to sell every 3-5 turns, but you could make money during many turns by buying paintings at a discount.

Someone once gave me the warning that there is a high correlation between the number of double-sale ("=") cards that you are dealt and your chance of winning.  I don't know what strategy to follow when you only have zero or one of these "=" cards.

Perhaps the purest auction game around.  Players take the role of art dealers, selling paintings of up-and-coming artists and buying paintings from other dealers to fill their galleries.  Good play requires not only a calculation of expected value, but also bluffing, assessing the strategy of other players, and acting as an effective auctioneer.  With many types of auctions, the action is never dull and tension is high right to the end-game.  It holds high replay value, mainly because of the large psychological component - reacting to the style of your opponents is far more important than playing a set optimized strategy.  I love that it is possible to win without ever buying a single painting!  Play the original German rules (the English "Double Trouble" variant) to mitigate some of the power of double auctions.

After playing both Masters Gallery and Modern Art (std), I have to say that I sympathize with those who wish the new game could have added more in return for what it took out.

The original Modern Art game seems to both flow along more quickly and to be more fun and involving than Masters Gallery, IMHO, despite the added effort trying to value and win paintings in auctions to increase net worth.

I like the classic artwork much better than the make-believe modern stuff used in the older version but nevertheless I have to say the original game is definitely better.

This game reminds me a lot of Texas Hold 'Em Poker. I think every collection should have this.

This game has some interesting aspects to it, and involves set collections with the complication that the last one doesn't count.  It has a lot of various auction action in it.

I find the Auctions a bit tedious after a while.  Perhaps I am not a big fan of auction games, or perhaps I find the "artwork" uninspiring.  Whatever, the reason, I find "For Sale" to be a better auction game for my taste than this.

Looking at this game on the 'Geek was really funny—I mean, all kinds of highly regarded folks were calling this one of their favorite games, and yet the box contents looked like, well, crap.  I was highly suspicious.  Then I played it.  It's crap all right—HOLY CRAP.  Holy Crap that is only to be taken out of its reliquary by the blessed hands of one who has been blinded by the fires of God's face and borne to the gaming table on the backs of nubile, yet coyly attired, virgins.  Yeah, it's that good.

Played at Psychocon (3 player game). I am rubbish at financial/auction games because I never know when I paying too much or too little and never seem to be able to control the biddings to my advantage.
Nevertheless, the game is quite good if the players get in the spirit - as we did - and play up their artists fates.

Second play, a little more into the groove. I'm starting to like this game more, and 5 players really make it better than 3. Also the banter within the group was really nice and nasty! Hehehe.

A modern classic and one of my favorite auction games. Where this stands out from others in the genre are the multiple kinds of auctions (Dutch, silent, once-around, etc) that add a layer of variety. The scoring is simple and nifty -- nothing has inherent value. It is a stark contrast to so many "economic" games where some invisible hand has set the prices of everything in the world.

RATING: 9
One of only three games I own which I recommend to both family and gamers, the others being Acquire and Scotland Yard.  The beauty of this game is that money for paintings being bought/sold stays amongst the players, so the benefit of every purchase must be weighed against the disadvantage of enriching the seller.  The game fuels great social interaction too.

I am tempted to nominate it "the purest auction game", but stop short only because I feel I must play a few more before concluding that!  In the mean time, I will declare it "my favourite pure auction game"!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An pure auction game - not usually my favourite as I tend to be bad at them :) 

Some cards (the double painting sales) seem a lot better. Who gets these is luck dependent.

The game in our group went very quickly, perhaps quicker than it is 'meant' to. I think only in the last round were any 'worthless' paintings sold. 

Have played it a few times now - although we were using the wrong rules, not realising that the player who closes the round loses a painting. Probably explains why our rounds went so fast :)

RATING: 9
The perfect auction game.  Just when you think you have it figured out, there is another layer revealed.  Absolutely incredible.  I thought I had a good plan with the bidding.  Just bid a little over half of the anticipated final value of the piece of art.  The problem is that the two people involved in the transaction make a profit and the other players receive nothing.  Is it better to pay more than half plus a bit to be one of the players making a profit - any profit - vs one of the players who receive nothing?  Is it better to win your own auctions at any price below the anticipated final value to deprive the other players of any profit?  Maybe selectively outbid the player who is a threat and let the player who isn't a threat win it to make more of a profit.  My mind is spinning.  A game shouldn't be easily figured out.  Is it even possible to figure this one out?  This game is just great!

遊戲設置 Set up

每人發100圓作為開始的資金。把牌洗好後接著依照遊戲人數發給每個人不同張數的手牌，5人玩發8張、4人玩發9張、3人玩發11張，其餘的面朝下作為牌庫。
玩者的錢是隱密的(屏風就是來擋錢的)，也不能將手上的牌公開。
牌張數由左到右12/13/14/15/16

遊戲流程 Playing the Game

隨機決定一個玩家先開始，從他開始順時針輪流賣畫。 
輪到一個人賣畫時，他必需要從手上選一幅畫來賣，如果他手上只有一張牌就必須打出那一張。賣的時候由出牌者來當主持人，成交的畫作公開放到買主面前，交易過的畫不得回到手上，也不得再拍賣。

回合結束的條件是，當有任何一個畫家的畫出現了五張時立即結束。
注意：第五張畫本身不得拍賣、也不屬於任何人(即使是主持人)，它唯一的作用是將回合結束掉。另外如果第五張是Double的話則不需找第二張搭配。

Open -- 公開競價
喊價者必需喊出比前一位喊價者的價錢高；主持人自己也能參與喊價。
如果都沒有人喊價，主持人便以零元自己買下。
Round (Once around) -- 一回合競標
由主持人左邊的人開始喊價，順時針繞一圈。
輪到某一個人喊價時，他可以選擇棄權，也可以喊一個價，但條件是必須是比上一家所喊的價高，最後一個喊價的是主持人自己，他能自己喊一個價買下，也能棄權，把畫賣給最後一個喊價者。

Sealed -- 秘密喊價 (暗標)
包括主持人從手上拿出若干數量的錢，抓在手上，同時亮出，由最高價者得標。
如果最高價由兩個以上的人開出，則由主持人左手邊最近的那一個人得標。
除非主持人也是出最高價的人之一，這種情況則由主持人得標。

Fixed -- 定價拋售
主持人出一個定價，這個價必須是主持人手上的錢所買得起的。
主持人左手邊的那一個人先說要不要以這個價錢買下，如果要的話就付錢買話，
不要的話則再以順時針問下一家要不要買。
如果都沒有人接受所定的價錢的話，主持人必須自己出錢把畫買下。

Double -- 成套賣畫
Double的畫有兩種賣法：
1.主持人拿出一張Double，再配上另一張同畫家但非Double的畫作，兩張一起賣。賣法則依第二張的種類。
2.主持人拿出一張Double，問他左邊的人願不願意參加。
要參加的話就必須打出一張同畫家但非Double的畫作。如果左邊的人不願或不能參加，如果一圈下來都沒人願意的話，則主持人能免費得到那一張畫。
如果有願意參加的話，那個人就變成新的主持人，以第二張畫的賣法賣畫。
賣得的錢由兩個人對分，奇數的話，多出的一元由新的主持人得到。
如果是舊的主持人買下則付一半給銀行、一半給新主持人，奇數多出的一元給新主持人。
新主持人買下的話也是一樣，祇是要把奇數多出的一元給銀行。
####注意：兩人合作賣出兩張畫後，下一個由新主持人左邊的人開始賣畫，中間的人全被跳過！###

第一回合結束
開始結算畫價。
將一個30元的標碼放在五張畫作的那一個畫家名字之下的第一個格子上(一共有四格代表四個回合)，
出現畫數第二多的則擺20元的標碼，第三多則擺10元。
其餘名次的畫家沒有價值。如果有同樣數量的畫家，則以名字在棋盤最左邊者優先。
###所有的人必須立刻將面前的(不包括手上的)畫依標碼的價格賣給銀行，賣出的畫放到美術館不得再使用。
###結束回合的那一張或兩張(是Double的話)畫不得賣出，直接進美術館。
下一回合開始
###補牌，用牌庫的牌來補，而不是美術館裡的。五個人玩的話，每一個人補三張；四個人補四張；三個人補六張。
####只有第二、三回合有補牌，第四回合不再補牌。
由上一回合結束遊戲者的左邊那一個人先開始。

當第四回合結束錢最多的人便是贏家。

Sencillamente, el mejor juego de subastas que he probado. En mi opinión, lo tiene todo: diversión, tensión, estrategia, astucia y mucha interacción... Perfecto. Me sorprende que otros juegos muy inferiores, como "Se vende", gocen de una calificación similar en la BGG. El 10 es porque, sencillamente, es el mejor juego que conozco en su género.
En el juego somos marchantes de arte. El objetivo es ser el que más dinero gane. Para ello, venderemos los cuadros que poseemos y compraremos otros. La clave está en saber manejar el mercado, compuesto por las obras de cinco artistas. A la hora de vender, cada obra establece el modo en qué se hará: subasta, subasta a ciegas, subasta a una ronda, precio fijo o subasta doble. El juego finaliza al cabo de cuatro rondas.
El juego se puede encontrar a un precio aceptable en el mercado nuevo o de 2ª mano, pero las cartas son horrorosas... imagino que para no pagar derechos de autor. Esto me convenció para fabricar mi propia versión con auténticas obras de arte. Siempre lo juego con mis hijos y me parecía un desperdicio renunciar al componente divulgador que un juego como éste puede tener. Así que no tienes excusa para no hacerte con él, bien comprándolo o bien imprimiendo alguno de los P&P que pueden hallarse en internet.

RATING: 9
Knizia's finest hour. An apparently simple bidding game which involves estimating the value of a commodity at the end of a round, then deciding how much 'cut' you are are prepared to give the auctioneer given your ability to boost the value during your turn. The game's not just about mathematics though, you need to listen to the 'market' and work out what people will pay over the odds for, then there's some luck (the '=' cards are very powerful and it hurts if you're not dealt them). There's also a chaos factor as you don't get anywhere without buying, but some players get caught up in bidding too much. This calculation of expected value can make the game borderline unplayable in some groups as the bidding tends towards the ultimate value of the painting and then the winner is the player selling the most (i.e. the one playing the most '=' cards). However, this is always enjoyable, has a (seemingly) short learning curve and for once in a Knizia game the theme fits perfectly.

Hard to wrap my head around this one.  I like the auctions, but there is a lot here I still have yet to understand, and I think a good portion of the strategy is in the auctioneering.

Great player interaction!  Very cool bidding systems (incorporating a host of other systems such as blind, once-arond, free for all, etc).  Game is almost entirely centered around the bidding which keeps everyone involved.  Little in the way of long term strategy planning however as overall positions can change drastically from one turn to the next.  

Just lowered my rating as we discovered a fundamental flaw in the system.  If some players constantly over pay for items and buy from each other, it effectively locks the more analyzing/skilled players out of the running.

This game is a lot of fun so long as you make sure that new players understand the basic maths of how auctions work or otherwise they may throw games horribly in favour of wiley players exploiting their poor valuations. I've found double auctions to be problematic too, as they essentially give a free turn whilst simultaneously giving strong price control power to the auctioneer.

RATING: 6
Despite popular myth this game is not broken or mathmaticaly inevitable unless you play it with robots or against yourself. As soon as you add in the human factor things stop being CERTAIN and start being PROBABLE. You dont know what cards others are holding and or how they are distrabuted, not everyone counts the cards, players often over or under bid based on what they hold. I have proved this game is not inevitable to several players purely by other bidding on certain rounds (kingmaking) and by buying everything in round four (and even 3 and 4) regardless of price and winning especially when you end the rounds early.

so conflicted. I see why it's highly rated. It's definitely a game that stands the test of time from 1992 (in terms of auction games). While I'm a Knizia fan, my favorites probably being Lost Cities and Battle Line (I have yet to pay Ra or Tigris), I can't say this game does much for me. I think I have something against pure auction games. I want something more. I think there are just so many better games to play with the same 45min time frame. If you love this game I wouldn't fault you for it. If you think it's just okay, I'm right there with you. It's smart and it's got so many different types of auctions but at the end of the day it's just not for me.

Neutral - on occasion

Classic bidding game. Very pure. The game is so accessible with its simple rules and intuitive game play.

However, it may not work in the mixed group because of the fact that one player can influence the game greatly by misjudging the value. Also, with more experienced, the game spaced is too limited by the given cards, especially the double bidding ones.

Modern Art is a quintessential auction game, but a tough one on newbies.  The variety of auctions and strategies available to a player are quite diverse (you can even win without ever buying a painting!).  I feel there was a touch too much chaos in hand draws and player seating though which, of course, doesn't help the learning curve problem.  In the end Modern Art is worth a play, but as for me, I prefer my auction games a tad quicker and more freeform.

Actually, better than I expected.  Auctions are fun!  Even the two player game is at least enjoyable.

I really need to play this with a larger group.  It's a really neat application of the prisoner's dilemma.  Only the seller and buyer are going to profit, so as the buyer you should be willing to give the seller most of the profit just so he doesn't share the profit with another potential buyer.

Aug08: Ended up tossing it.  Auctions are fun, but not if you can't value the item.  Newbies tend to through the game to whoever offers up the doublers.  I'll stick to Ra in the mean time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the different aspects: The different types of auctions, the timing of round ending, the choices that affect not just how much money you spend or gain right now, but how much a painter's paintings will be worth down the line, including in later rounds.

But it's a little dry and for me Ra is much more fun and exciting.

The non-linear valuation of paintings makes this a solid '10' in game play. I love the fact that every painting has a different value to each player depending on who buys it, each player's overall position relative to each other player, what cards are in each player's hand, and so on. Really fun mental calculations can be had on almost every auction in this game.

However, the component quality is truly dreadful. The plastic money chips are cheap looking, feeling, and are missing an important denomination. The cardboard screens aren't much better. Due to the components this game cannot be rated a '10'.

Fun auction game, in which you are trying to drive the price of certain paintings up by buying them, all the while being careful not to overspend and lose money in the process.

Very simple game with several rounds of auctions and not much else.

Would be great for families and young teenagers as it has simple hand management and basic accounting while being lively and engaging.

RATING: 10
This is one of my top 10 games of all time, and definitely my favorite auction game -- largely because it's as much about the cardplay and reading the other players (and trying to manipulate them) as much as it is about the auctions. 

I also love love love how simple the rules are for such a very deep game. I've actually had great success playing it with nongamers -- sure, they'll play suboptimally/unpredictably and so you can't anticipate and manipulate the proceedings as much as you can with gamers, but the open auctions can be really fun, especially if you play with house rules that (1) you have to give a name to each painting you put up for auction and (2) you have to talk in the stereotypical accent of the city name on your player screen. It's Reiner Knizia's best party game! (seriously)

Played several times with 4 and 5 players. Compared with the other auction games I know (Ra, Magellan, Fist of Dragon Stones), Modern Art has simpler rules and more variety in the type of auctions used. The theme doesnt't really grab me - perhaps because the box and components in this latest edition are too conservative and the 'modern art' itself could be more prominent. However the game itself is very interesting, with the only negative aspect being that the cards you are dealt have a significant impact on your ability to make money.

A workable auction game, I must say that I prefer that there be an actual game onto which the mechanic is attached to. It seems they defined how the auctions should work in this game and just went home after that.

My second favorite bidding game.  You have to have people who get into the spirit of the game though.  This is an auction game and that's how you have to play.  Get excessive and into the spirit of the game.    If everyone is quiet and mathemtically planning each move, then this game gets boring in a hurry.  

If the Christin P.'s were "heavily influenced during his trip stateside by the overgrown weeds outside your friend's house" or if a painting you are offering is "just plain rubbish", then the game is a blast.

I like the scoring, but I only tend to like auction games when the items up for bid have different values to different players. While the cards in the players hand make this so for the early auction rounds, as time goes by and the cone of uncertainty narrows, the appropriate bids are blindingly obvious.

The most fun I've had in this game is in trying to keep that cone wide, but that doesn't necessarily correlate with winning.

My first Knizia, big disappointment.  I'm not convinced by anything: mechanic (*not* elegant, too chaotic for me), theme, game components (awful).  This game very easily gets out of control although I realize that strategies are described here and there.  I do NOT want to test them.  I just dont't feel this game.

A fairly light playing, fun and fast pace auction game with a short playing time as well making it very accessible to just about any group. Playing well however will take many games as the strategies are quite subtle here. 

This feels like a card game cleverly disguised as an auction game (even though it is a pure auction game), and how clever it is. The best part of the game is the psychology behind the scenes and the laughter that comes from it. There is certainly some nice strategic play to be had here and timing plays a critical role in it. 

Funny when I first heard about this game I thought it would be more like the old classic "Masterpiece" with paintings, psychology, auctions and the like but this is very very different in a good way. Simple rules and variety in the type of auctions big positives here, great little game that is fun every time.

Custom deck made at artscow.com.  This is one of those games that the fun level depends on who you play with.  It can be maddening to play with newbies that haven't grasped what a reasonable bid is, and don't understand how they are helping or hurting other players.  Getting a bad hand can also ruin the game, but when you have a decent hand and are playing with experienced players, this game is amazing.

I love this game. Knizia's Top 5 along with Taj Mahal, Tigris & Euphrates, Medici and Ra. The auction can be quite brutal as players conspire with one another to raise or drop the price of an artwork. Mechanically, this game combines all kinds of auctions found in most Euro games (open bid, one round bid, closed bid, name a price). The game is also an entry game since the rules are so simple, yet the player interactions make up the game. Brilliant.

I like auction games but this is a game that I just never enjoy playing even after playing it many many times. In fact, I dread it, I just hate this game!!! My game group also didn't care for the game so we never played it. It's very highly overrated in my opinion. In fact, I owned it, played it, hated it, sold it, later thought "it must be me", bought it again, played it again, hated it even more, traded it again. R.I.P.

RATING: 6
Sell your art (cards) from your hand, in turn, and then cash in art (cards) that you bought at the end of the round based on a sliding scale. Only three of the kinds of art (out of 6) are actually worth anything based on what there is most of. "Round" is a misnomer because it lasts until there are 5 of one kind in front of all players. I'm not a big fan of auction games, but this one is okay.

Knizia auction game. The gameplay of Modern Art feels a bit like Medici but it is in all aspects more gut-wrenching and mind-numbing than that game (in a good way!) Each and every auction in the game involves an enormous amount of variables which need to be evaluated.

This is a very, very good game that encourages players to fully participate in the theme. The actual values and optimal strategies seem to be very dependent upon the players at the table. It's great if you want a highly interactive game with simple rules and plenty of room for tough decisions.

Best of all, it's fun. This game encourages laughter and lots of talking among the players at the table.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (January 2011)

One of the best Knizia´s I have ever played, I love auction mechanics and this game has a lot of them. The game is simple enough to teach in 5 minutes but it has a surprising depth, sadly I have not played it as much as I want to. IMO one of the best (if not THE best) auction game out there (although I have not played Ra or Medici.)

The art of the game is adequate but it could have been a lot better, however it doesn’t detract from the fun of the game.

This game is a must have in any game collection.

I continue to love Modern Art. I found the game to be more complex (in decisions, not in rules) that I initially thought. I previously thought that I had figured out the game, but that is not the case :D.

I continue to like Modern Art but my desire to play it again is decreasing over time. One of the issues I have with the game is that it is too fragile. When a player pays too much for a work of art, he unbalances the game and that opens the possibility for a win, even if the player played a sub-optimal strategy. I dislike this as I feel it isn’t a deserved win. If a player played better he should win in an strategy game, but that’s not the case here.

Another issue I have with Modern Art is when players purposely  generate king-making situations. I have seen a player paid almost all his money to make another player win :/. There is no way to control tis with the rules, so I only like to play with very competitive players, players who won’t throw the game.

I still like the game though.

2017-08-31

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2017)

I´m very glad CMON decided to reprint this classic. I love Modern Art and it was a very expensive game.

The rules of the game have changed a bit and I dislike the new rule, it feels unfair. When a player offers a double bid he can allow the next opponent to add a painting of the same kind. Under the old rules both players would share the profits by half. Under the new rule the opponent will get 100% of the profits. It is unfair as each player supplied a painting. In all honesty this change could have been made before the CMON edition, but I only noticed it now. I checked the rules I have and each player wins money if they played a painting.  It is a minor issue though, but it bothers me a bit.

Another minus for me is that the players shield doesn’t have the aid that they used to have. That was very useful to explain the game and to move the game forward in a fast manner. In our game many players had to ask again ¿what kind of bid is this? A minor issue, but I don’t know why they were removed.

The game´s components are ok and functional but I vastly prefer the poker chips of the older edition.

From my limited perspective, the art is now amazing. In the previous edition it was ugly, now it is gorgeous and the cards are Dixit big, so you can appreciate it a lot better. A friend said the art is very cool but the graphic design was bad. I didn’t understand why he said that (he is an expert on the topic) until I realized the paintings have names. It was only until the end of the game that I noticed this and my friend told me that was due to bad graphic design. He also told me more examples that I didn’t really understand so I won’t write them here :D.

Bottom line, I´m very glad Modern Art is available now. I won’t buy it because I have the old ugly edition, and that's enough for me. If a game looks great, it is a plus, but I´m always more concerned about gameplay than looks and the game plays great. I totally recommend it. For the full comments on the game, please read the other entry.

(No 2P support)

Our position on games focussing on auction mechanics is shifting to less enjoyment.
-------------------------------
I haven't seen any other game like this one. An "abstract bidding" game? I'd rate it higher if I specifically enjoyed the art-world spoof element as well as the game mechanics. As it stands this is pure distilled essence-of-auction. The items you bid for don't let you take some funky action later, or give you extra resources toward some build. The things you buy just... sit there... and, um, change value.

God, I've been hovering around this for a very long time...I think it could be a very good auction game, but I've burned out on the auction mechanics over all (in some way, it feels like false competition and crutch mechanic to me). 

I wonder if Modern Art would be family/casual gamer friendly? 

As a Kinzia fan, I'd love to try it out.

RATING: 8
Simpler mechanisms and more fun than most auction games, although the variety of auction types gives it an edge. However, the game's made by the subtle underplay between the players as they try to figure out what each painting is likely to be worth given their hands and how they read the other players' intentions and holdings.

Classic Knizia; super-simple mechanics belying a remarkable amount of psychological interplay between the players. No other designer does this stuff better - right up my street!

An open bidding auction for a painting of a known value could logically produce a set of marginal decisions that do not reach equilibrium until the known value is approached.  However, the game is saved by the different types of auction mechanics and the value of a painting is never known with full certainty until the round ends and will also depend on the cards of the players.

One of the best auction games, maybe THE best for 5 players. The problem is that the gameplay suffers significantly with fewer players, with the score dropping by as much as 2 points for every player you lose. So while the game is not very versatile, I think it absolutely sings with 5. It's very easy to get caught up in the auctions and overpay like crazy. Keep in mind that you'll often make more money selling a painting that you put up for auction than buying it yourself. A disciplined approach is required to win, I think.

This is an interesting auction game which has different types of auctions depending on the card. You start with a hand of cards that have paintings by various artists. After five from one artist are sold the round ends. Then the three artists with the most art sold that round give you points for most to least sold of 30, 20, or 10 coins. After four rounds the player with the most money wins. Having the different auction types adds to the fun of the game.

This is commonly hailed as Knizia's purest auction game and it also highlights what he does best - a simple ruleset that gives rise to many interesting angles that you don't immediately think of. Rating has climbed steadily the more I play it.

I held out for French version by Matagot rather than picking up the English version by Mayfair. Absolutely recommended, the better components and much superior style really do add to my enjoyment of the game. And it's a game that you can teach to newbies, so visual appeal is helpful.

One of the most unattractive graphic designs ever! Therefore it rested for more than ten years on the shelf. Now with a group of regular gamers it shows up every two or three years. Too bad, as it needs experienced players to live up to its potential. Otherwise, there's the danger that actions of unexperienced players (especially fixed price auctions or unreasonably high bids) throw the game to another player. Still, after almost 20 years this game is a benchmark for pure auction games if you don't mind calculating and can live without any whistles and bells.

Enjoyable bidding game - Maybe Herr Dr. Knizia has figured out the mathematical winning formula -- I sure haven't...  There are people I call "intuitive economists" (like my mother-in-law) who always seem to clean up at this.
I am disappointed in the components of the Mayfair edition -- a game themed like this needs way better art direction (and better art).

A great, quick, fun auction game. I've played a fair bit of the AI version but had my first FtF play in 10/08. The sheer variety of the auctions, the variable values the paintings can acquire over four rounds, and the fun interaction make this a winner for me. First games are going to involve trying to figure out how not to overbid, when to use the double sales, and just what the different auction types are like.

My favorite auction game. In my early plays, I struggled to sell my hand for the best prices. With more plays under my belt, I now work to manipulate the values the paintings will have at the end of the auction.

I've played once with four, and it seemed too easy to control the game. With five I feel more like I have to "ride" the market.

I don't know why this game is as good as it is. It's a simple set-collection game with bidding, etc... but it works so well for what it is. I would generally still suggest a drafting-style set collection game over this (Anything from Sushi Go/Kingdomino/Between Two Cities/7 Wonders), but it works so well I feel bad even suggesting that. 

The theme even plays well somehow, with the idea that modern art pieces are really only worth anything if a decent number of people want them... which in turn makes people want them more now that they are worth something... which creates the crazy art experiences in real life.

RATING: 9
Wow, what a tremendous game.  After reading the rules one would think that this is simply a "greatest hits" auction game, but it's so much more than that.  The way that the paintings fluctuate wildly in value is a lot of fun, seems very thematic, and provides a roadblock to those who would just try to calculate the value.  It boggles my mind to think of how this game was designed - the different styles of auctions mesh together quite nicely and add to the turn angst.  The cumulative effect of each round keeps interest high, right up till the end.  What's more, it plays great with three players.  I've had pretty good luck with Knizia auction games with 3 players, but this one surprised me.  Medici is pure and elegant, Traumfabrik is very thematic, and I still can't put my finger on Ra.  But to me this one rises above its peers, which is really saying something when you consider the company.  My one caveat is that the fun factor definitely depends on the types of players.

RATING: 9
Rating for the Scandinavian version.

I would subtract a point for having different artist names (though in general they are just about as fun as the original ones), but this version makes up for it in two ways.

First, assigning titles to the paintings is a good idea, you can introduce your painting a little bit if you should feel so inclined.

Second, the artwork in general is superior.  I understand that the whole theme is kind of tongue in cheek, with art that is supposed to be kind of ridiculous, but these paintings are more attractive while still being easy to ridicule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The artwork in general I like more than the original version, but less than the Scandinavian and Brazilian versions.  However, the cards are bigger and seem to be of much better quality than the Brazilian version.

The artist names are not as fun, but aren't really a problem, and the symbols used to indicate the different types of auctions are clear.

Otherwise the game is exactly the same.  It's nice to have this one in rotation, and it's also nice to have some 10 (euro) coins, even if there still don't seem to be enough to go around, especially toward the end of the game.

Rating for Brazilian version. 

Pros: Artwork is really nice. I guess part of the fun of Modern Art is the ridiculous artwork (and artist names), but it's really cool to look at these cards.

Cons: The biggest annoyance is that the money chits are not double sided, causing extra confusion and down time in keeping all of your chits right side up.  Also, the fact that there are sprues still left on the cards is a little annoying as well.  Finally (and this is not the game's fault), using letters to distinguish the different kinds of auctions as opposed to symbols is an annoyance.

So, while Modern Art is one of my favorite games, the presentation is nice, but the components leave you wishing that they had just invested a little more effort.

Great and growing. Knizia makes another of those games that is complex enough to leave you without an obvious optimal strategy, while simple enough to pick up on the first game. This seems to have at least a 2 game steep learning curve (read: will get spanked by exp players). Not as dry as some of his other games.

RATING: 8
A very clever mathematical representation of the skyrocketing and crashing prices for modern art (Karl Gitter and Yoko and the white painting in the play "Art" really are interchangeable). As an economist I can appreciate its incorporation of risk, expected value, and an intuitive demonstration of stock options. It also shows how easy it is to manipulate prices in a thin market. This is a wonderful game for use in a finance class but it strikes me as a bit dry for regular play. The problem is that until new players understand these ideas they will get crushed and after a few games general strategy becomes obvious (e.g. encourage others to promote your doubles in the early rounds). I realize that if you can bring together four highly skilled players it could become a fascinating tactical game but getting to that point is probably not worth the effort (unless you have a homogeneous group that does not mind repetition and rarely introduces new players). There are so many other great games that work from the first play that I rate this game a point lower than it probably deserves.

As an addendum, you will notice from my other ratings that I strongly dislike blind bidding. This game has it on some auctions but it is implemented perfectly such that skilled players are more capable of determing the appropriate amount below expected value to bid.

RATING: 7
An auction game of fairly minimalistic design, with a hand management layer and a scoring layer and not much besides. By choosing what cards to auction from your hand, you manipulate expectations, set up opportunities and invite collusion. The theme is oddly appropriate. The uncertain valuation and round ending mechanism are reminiscent of Flinke Pinke, although there's more texture and depth here. A few concerns: 1) The decisions made in the game are highly mathematical in nature and one wrong move could throw the game (especially the fixed price auctions are sensitive to seating order). Calculating the potential value of cards is pretty much the core activity, so stay away if that sounds unengaging. Players also need to be able to focus on not just how much they're making from a purchase, but how much the seller is making as well. 2) The double auctions are powerful and valuable and you simply may not be dealt any. A lot hinges on the third deal: if for instance Krypto's been neglected for the first two rounds and you suddenly hold every last Krypto going into the third round, your hand is simply worth less than everybody else's and you won't make as much money selling and you probably won't win. 3) I'm not at all sure the game wouldn't be better if there were just one or maybe two types of auction (open and hidden).

Based on 2 plays.  Although certainly not bad, MA is one of my least favorites of Knizia's auction games.  The auction system, whereby the bidder pays to the auctioneer, creates a series of game-theory style dilemmas which are better suited for mathematics than board games.  Once you can calculate with reasonable accuracy (which has not been very difficult in my experience), prices tend to approach X-1, where X is the projected value.

初の競りゲー。なかなかおもろい。
勝ち筋はいかに安く買うかではなく、いかに高く相手に売りつけるかにあるような気がする。ダブルがかなり強い。カードを売る機会が単純に増えるから。あるだけ使った方がいいかもしれん。カードを買うかどうかの基準はカードを出した人との持ち金の差が重要。
もしみんなが同点の場合、出されたカードの期待値の半額が適正値。そのカードの期待値をどう見積もるかを争うゲーム。自分に高く売れそうなカードが手元にあれば適正値より高く売ってもいいかも。しかしこんなに買い叩くゲームになるとは思わへんかった。あとはカードマネジメント。高く売ることができそうなデザイナーとかダブルとかをいいタイミングで吐き出せるか。１ラウンド目にリードを奪えるとその後の試合展開がやや楽。

Buen sistema de mercado, me gusta la mecánica del juego y la revalorización que supone en los cuadros.

Me he dado cuenta de que quien tenga la suerte de tener cartas de doble subasta tiene ventaja, sobretodo si es con un autor bien valorado. La suerte gana un peso importante y no me gusta tanto.

Essentially just a thematic excuse to play around with different bidding mechanics, but it works well, with some nice tricksiness in balancing the markup you make on a bought painting against the full profit that the seller gets.

Auctioning stuff is fun. If you agree, you'll probably like the game.

It's a little frustrating that if you never get dealt any double-auction cards, you pretty much can't possibly win.  This has annoyed me deeply a couple times.

It's also possible -- I've seen it happen -- for a player to make nothing but totally dumb decisions and have no idea what's going on, yet still win.  At the same time the rest of us were really putting some thought and care into our decisions.  That felt wrong for a game with some depth like this.  I saw that happen twice.

First, I hate auctions, Second I hate Reiner Knizia's games.

Since it's an action only game, and that it make sense for art gallery to auction paintings, it somewhat makes sense which makes auction less bad. I like the fact that there are various type of auctions.

What I don't like is how you determine the price of the painting, it is a bit hard to calculate and plan ahead. I would not mind having something more random.

RATING: 8
If you really like auction games, then this one should be right up your alley.  It has a wide variety of different auction methods coupled with different art cards.  I usually prefer incoporating the variant where you seperate the Double Auctions cards (as a second small deck) and re-balance by evenly distributing the "double auction" cards with each player having equal amount dealt each round.  Otherwise, randomness might give a player more advantage with more "doubler cards".

Let's see . . . a constant stream of tense , exciting decisions of risk and investment.  Five kinds of auctions means it never gets repetitive.  The season-to-season value rollover means the game gets more and more dramatic as you progress.  And it has a brilliantly satirical theme, one that only gets better if you ham it up a bit and give names to paintings and biographies to artists. 

Modern Art is a winner on all counts.  This is not a game of number-crunching.  It's a game of relationships -- of creating situations in which the situation that is most beneficial to your opponent is MORE beneficial to you.  Brilliant.  One of the most original designs I've seen.  

Is there a flaw?  Well, a new player, or someone who just can't grasp certain basic concepts in the game, can completely unbalance it for everyone else, causing windfalls for undeserving plays or playing random paintings that throw the whole economy out of whack and render good play and forward-thinking moot.  I tend to prefer games that punish a bad player by himself, not the group as a whole.  

But in a group of players who think ahead and stay on their toes, this is absolutely one of the most exciting games out there.  Margins of victory can be extremely close:  I just took second in my last game, 404k to 407!

Interesting...it seems to be the Eurogame which the wargamers very much like to play.  Want to find out why. 

The game mimic the different types of auctions quite well...just that I haven't figured out any strategy as yet because my experience with this is short.  Good filler game but it seems that it is all about money.  Limited interaction among the players except at the time of open auction. For wargamers, it is a bit shallow to play.

Auctions and bidding, that's what this game is. If you dislike that sort of thing look elsewhere. But what this game does with bidding is phenomenal. Essentially a heady card game, moves at a fast pace and of course great art!

It took me a while before I got this game. In the beginning everyone was bidding like crazy just because it was fun to bid. And then it dawned on us that we were constantly buying art at a loss :D. If you're teaching this game, you really need to teach the new players how to properly value the art. Otherwise they will overvalue them and end up profiting other players unfairly. If everyone is familiar with the game though, I think this would be a great filler game.

An excellent game of art speculation and auctions.  Despite the convoluted math analysis on this site, it’s really much more a game of psychology than of math — If you can sell your paintings toward the end of their most highly-priced rounds, you’ll do very well.  So try to figure out who is pushing which artists, and you can time your sales to take advantage of their plays.

Rating based on 3 3-player games.  I fully expect this rating to rise to a 9 as soon as I get to play with more players, since it was readily apparent how more players would add to the richness and depth of this game.  Probably will end up as a 10 with enough time and plays.

This game is just really fun.

UPDATE: I've now played this with 4, and it is MUCH better (as I expected) so I've bumped it to 8.5.  Still waiting for a chance to play with 5 though.

UPDATE: Still no 5p plays yet (*sigh*), but this game is really growing on me with more plays.  As the strategic possibilities are beginning to reveal themselves the game is becoming much richer and more engaging than it was as an almost purely tactical exercise. Modern Art is starting to seep into my thoughts even when I'm not actually playing it, and is the first serious rival I've found for Princes of Florence as my favourite Euro.  I dunno, maybe I'm just an auction whore :)

UPDATE: i now have a couple of 5p games under my belt, and it really is great. My fellow players have yet to get beyond the rudiments of strategy, however (my main competitor tends to play it as a "headology" game as opposed to my strategic approach), which means that it hasn't had a chance to shine in its full glory for me yet.

Fingers crossed.

UPDATE: Okay, I've played with 5 a couple of times, plus several other plays with 4. This is a timeless classic, and I will always play it happily. Expected Value barely counts as the tip of the iceberg of the strategy and tactics in this game. Strategic hand management, reading information from your opponents' bids, bluffing with your own bids...and...just...more!

The only fly in the ointment is that, with some players, you have to focus more on what types of mistakes they will make rather than on playing the game to its fullest. In particular, the bandwagon effect, and players who bid erratically can drag it down a little. Even so, it [i]is[/i] possible to adjust, and it is still well worth playing.

i had no desire to get this game.  its so ugly.  but for $1 at barnes and noble game clearance i bought one.  (i should have bought more).  the day we first played, i made someone else read the rules and teach us.  i was not at all thrilled.  the rules were boring.  and then we started playing.

wow.  the tensity of gameplay was wholly unexpected from the packaging and rules presentation.  a great game.

A great Reiner Knizia auction game where you auction paintings using different auction types.  Once you have 5 of the same painter's art out in round, you score.  Each painter is paid more if they have sold more in the auction round.  The only down side is that players can overpay for a painting.  This can allow someone else to win when you have played well.  

A good fun game and it is a great family weight game.

Auction game with art buyign theme. There is sime strategy in deciding when to sell a painting just for money, when to sell paintings that you want, and when to stop rounds. I found that the 4th round was too much, dragging too long. Not much of a fan of Medici, this one is longer, and more strategic, but not so much fun. Ra any day over these other ones.

Right now this is my favorite bidding/auction game, other than Amun-Re.  I like the unpredictability of the value of the art pieces.  One drawback might be the numerous type of auctions.  Fewer would make the game a bit easier and focused more on predicting the value of the art.  But I did not mind that too much.

I can't imagine getting past the hideousness of the graphics and into gameplay. It's random pictures with a couple basic Phoshop filters applied.

Auction based game - where players auction for artwork, and only art that ends up having value are the artists with the top 3 most sold pieces each round; so you have to be careful how you bid and watch what your opponents are doing.  Cool game; and there are various types of auctions (highest bidder, blind bidding, increase by player bidding, etc) so it keeps it interesting.

Interesting game that I've played about 3 times now.  Need to play it some more, but I can see my rating increase as I understand the game more.  My group has a great time with it - always harassing the highest bidder.  "You paid how much for that?!?!"  

I like trying to manipulate which cards are going to be worth more, but I do feel a little is lost in this game because not everybody I play with accounts for the real value of the paintings they bid on.  Makes the game a litte chaotic, but it is still a lot of fun!

This is an interesting auction game. I especially like the way in which the game pokes some fun at the Modern Art world where you see a lot of garbage being sold by lots of cash, just because some artist has somehow been hyped. The weak artwork is, as far as I can see, part of this.

One of the jewels in gaming's crown.

A perfectly themed auction game about modern art. As probably everyone at this point has played the game, I'm not sure what to add other than it can be a bit brittle if people bid more than a painting can possibly be worth, still, the game is so fun that such problems don't detract from the experience.  Anyway, it'll be over in an hour and people will have learned from their mistakes, so you might as well play it again with people keeping better control of their cash.

I think this is a really fun game, but the game can become cumbersome if only one or two people score big in the first round.  As a result, the people with the money can generally bid high on everything, and really make it difficult for the people behid to make money.

Last game I played the guy to my left, who will go nameless (JoeLee), bitched about the two people at the far end of the table crazy bidding anything and how there was nothing anybody could do about it.  I ended up winning however, so maybe he is just a crack-pot.

This game is just fun. Crammed full of different kinds of auctions, there's a good amount of think-y tension in timing the playing of cards: what artist? what kind of auction? how do you maximize your dollar or get the most out of others? It's lively and great, and currently it's my favourite game of Knizia's auction trilogy.

RATING: 8
Mayfair edition.  Modern Art is a deep card game with strategic implications that most players don't realize.  The rules are easily teachable but how to create a game plan is not.  The result is that most players will play it once or twice, not get it, and move on to another game.  Like other sophisticated auction games where players are both selling and buying, it's hard for new players to get their heads around the value of a painting.  There is also a poker/psychological element to the game--bluffing and trying to manipulate other players to join with you in playing particular paintings to the table.  The best players always win this game.

Definately want to play more, but not because I enjoyed the first play. Rather uneventful first play.

Update: Second game with a different group was really good and much better than the first!

Update: Increase 7 » 7.75. Popular game choice with my gaming group! 

I agree that a few bad moves by someone can throw the game away in favor of the party that gets the really good deal. However, I guess my group(s) and myself don't really mind. Technically, there can be only 1 winner. But when we play to have fun, everyone wins.

Update: 7.75 » 8. Very good game with high replayability, simple rules and engaging game play.

The rating depends on your group roleplaying the art sales.  If so, it can be hysterically "can't breath" funny.  Has a nice 45 minute duration.  Not clear who will win until late in the game.

I really like this game; however, it has gone over so-so with the rest of the group.  I seem to win at this being a little more math-minded than the rest of the group (who are overbidding for almost everything -- I'm winding up winning by obscene amounts and have been accused of cheating on more than one occasion).  Still, we've had fun playing it.  It also helps that I'm still building a collection and we're limited on 5-player games.  This game may increase a little bit after a few more plays with some players who are a little better shoppers.

RATING: 6
As a rule I don't enjoy pure auction games but this one is a cut above mainly due to the mechanic of paying other players. This makes it challenging and interesting to correctly value the paintings.

***

Update: Downgraded and traded away. The auctions are too calculational and the game become tedious instead of fun.

The first time that I ever played this game I fell in love with it. It's an art auction game, and it explores different styles of auctions. Your goal is to have the most money at the end of the game, by boosting the popularity or value of different art styles/artists. 

This game is group dependent though, it has fallen flat a couple of times when I brought it out for different groups.

My favourite bidding game. Love the fact that there are different types of auctioning - makes it less repetitive than other bidding games. 

I really like the economic aspect of this game. The value of the art changes each round. You have to know when to be buyer or when to be a seller.

A no bullsh!t, pure auction game. Use your influence and speculate on others' action to estimate what each piece of art might worth each season, then plan both your sell and your bids accordingly. Easy to teach, intuitive play. Most gamers and non-gamers would enjoy. Rating it a personal "10" because of the art theme and excellent execution of the auctions.

First experience playing in person was a lot different than against AI.  Surprisingly, half the fun was in table talk -- goading others into overbidding or playing a specific card.  Some auction formats seemed to end in overbids more often than others (e.g. - open auctions were definitely higher on average than blind bidding).  I'm sure a lot of this was due to our relative inexperience with the game.  I imagine that with a group of experienced players bidding would become more precise and math-based and hand management would become the primary factor in determining the winner.

Modern Art is an incredible, incredible game if you are playing with five players who know exactly what they are doing.  If you play with one player who just doesn't  get things then the game breaks down completely...  Unfortunately these times have soured my opinion quite a bit...

RATING: 4
12/02/03 Played a four-player game. I won but I have no idea how.
09/20/05 Played another four-player game. The heart of the game, figuring out what the works of art are worth relative to each other (so you know what to bid) was quite baffling for me. If it hadn't been for one player (who was an economics professor) giving me constant advice on the probable worth of items up for auction, I'd have had no idea what to bid. 

I have a strange reaction to Modern Art. Its more complicated than I'd prefer for an auction game. I sort of like it, but I'm absolutely no good at it. I just can't grasp the relative worth of the items. So it turns into an exercise in frustration. I might play it again... sometime.

Funny joke aside, this game is a gem in the auction and speculation department.  I loved the way you could end a round to collect the most money and the psychological game behind the auctions.  Knizia is sure coming with great ideas.  As for the theme, the painting could surely have been from real painting coming from the public domain.  In any case, thumbs up for this one.

Interesting concept. A bit longer, but much nicer than High Society. Every player can have an effect on the game and change the way it's going. I like the different strategies you can have. Selling at high price, or trying to own the painting that are going to be worth something. Putting a new artist on the board or finishing a set of 5... Then, having your option changed, depending on what you had in your hand... I had fun with this one and I'm really interested in trying it again.

Lunch time middle-ground game depending on group mood and interest.

A truly excellent auction game - particularly with 4-5. The different auction types, along with the tension of what to buy, and what and when to sell (due to the value increases each round), make this game fantastic.

This game has subtle strategies and is very easy to teach and learn.  There are so many elements to it and yet it is elegant and smoothe.  Fun for families and serious gaming groups alike.

A bit too random, in that as prices start creeping up (and they will), far more of the percentage of the return on art is given to the seller -- so drawing a good set of art is a big win.  But fun -- I should play it again occasionally; haven't for a few years.

revisited this after a two or three year hiatus.  really neat auction game that i think is almost underrated in today's realm.  does have the skill outlier issue where if one player is dramatically different in skill/experience it can lead to a bit of a goofy game.  the game does not overstay it is welcome, so not too big of a problem.

Reading your opponents, intentions and inclinations is also important to good play.

One of the best auction games ever published.  Fantastic game.

Mayfair Games edition.

Not only is this not nearly as exciting as Ra - the mathematics behind it make it more cold and calculating and a ton less intuitive. The more I've played this, the more irritated I become. I feel I am constantly at the whim of the stupidity of the other people at the table. Maybe it's my own fault for trying this several times with non-gamers, but I think this is a game that people think is deep, but turns out to be nothing more than a trump and bid card game. Blegh. I would trade it away if I thought my wife wouldn't yell at me (she actually likes it.)

Furthermore, the Mayfair edition I have has fairly lousy production quality - cards with black borders that I have to handle carefully (or spend money to put in protectors) or the wear will eventually show around the edges, and the art itself is UGLY. I get that the ugly art may itself be a commentary on modern art, but in this case it literally looks like some 8th grade graphic design class slapped it together.

Sublime. This might be the most brilliant design I have encountered. Extremely accessible but always interesting for gamers. The theme IS the game; I've never seen the two as perfectly melded as they are here. Throwing in a modest amount of role-playing (accents, auctioneering, analyzing the paintings) makes it a hoot all around, but gamer types can still be crunching numbers to value their bids. [-]Perhaps my only complaint is that it can drag a little with inexperienced players, who don't end rounds as quickly as they should. 45 minutes is perfect for this game, but an hour starts to feel just a little long.[/-]

Idiot. This game is as long as it needs to be. I just lost sleep over reconstructing my last game in my brain, seeing where I went "wrong."

Really enjoyed it and won my first game.  Looking forward to further plays.  Another Knizia classic.
Second game as good as the first, though I didn't win.  Love the auctioning, bluffing.  Just a great game.  Fairly paced and pretty easy to teach, too.

This game is in a different class.
It's a simple card game (like Trendy) but each card played triggers an auction to buy the card. 
There are 4 different types of auction as well as a double play card.

When you get into it the game is mostly about bluffing.

I teach the game with the use of the rule where a single double card is passed around the table and anyone who can add an auction card to it takes all the spoils. 
This is called the Double Trouble variant in the rules.
Try it!!

Hand management and (lots of) auctions. The components are pretty solid (the the screens could be a bit more sturdy). The theme, such as it is, makes sense. The first game was a little chaotic and pretty math-y. Feel like it's probably the kind of game that improves with repeat plays.

RATING: 10
One of Knizia's best games.  Game balance can be thrown off if all players are not actively computing the amount they stand to make versus the amount the opponent stands to make for any given transaction.  Good play requires ability to do simple math and make high pressure sales.  Holding cards that are in high demand also comes in very handy, but you have some control in that regard by holding the best cards until round three.

I wanted to like this game.  But then I opened the box.  The Mayfair edition components are putrid, and the gameplay itself is even worse.  My group couldn&#039;t figure out if we were too smart to enjoy the game or not smart enough.  Simple math dictates at what point a bid is too high to have any return, and so the bidding always reaches a certain point and stops.  The strategy in this game was difficult to grasp, and when playing we never had fun.  5 is a pretty generous score, but I like Knizia, so I won&#039;t go any lower.

Fantastic auction game that always gets a good response when I introduce it.  It's very important to watch how much you spend for a painting as opposed to how much you are taking in.  The winners in this game seem to be the best sellers, not the best buyers.

Definitely my favorite Knizia game. I quite enjoy the theme and the zero sum nature of the bidding. 

The strategy might not be readily apparent to some but playing with a group of experienced players makes the bidding very intense as overbidding by even 1 is enough to win or lose you the game.

More than many other games, this is a game about information advantage.  This comes out in the auctions, but also in the choice of what card to play on your turn.  There are a lot of little tactical nuances not evident on first play, as well (though that also means that there's a moderately-serious left-right binding issue sometimes).

RATING: 8
Modern Art is frequently mentioned among Knizia's best auction games and rightfully so. The idea is simple: bid on items where the value is set by the players' own expectations and nothing else. Take turns to choose a painting to auction. The more an artist is sold, the higher the value of the paintings. The fact that values are accumulated over seasons adds an important but difficult timing challenge as well.

What speaks against Modern Art is that group thinking plays an important part in the game. Auction paintings randomly and you'll get a random and most likely boring game. I've only scratched the surface of this little gem but I expect it to offer a lot with the right group.

I used to like Modern Art. A lot. But I am done with it now.  The game does not scale well, and it seems like there are either 3 artists played, or fewer. In addition, inexperienced players can really unbalance the game, but even with experienced players, you often are in a situation that you cannot win.

I can see what the game should be, and it has occasionally been that for me, but this game frustrates me too much to play it again.

Bid for paintings produced by five different artists. Trick is that values of paintings are not known until the scoring phase and depends on the number of paintings sold. I know this is one of Knizia's designs but this game never grabbed me. Perhaps with the feel of the lack of control where people can overbid for paintings, or there is not much variety in the way to accumulate money (unlike other Knizia designs, say Taj Mahal or Ra), the game feels a bit dry to me. I know a lot of people like it, but it doesn't get better for me after each playing.

One of the best auction games ever. Also I say this is one of the best Knizia's games. Knizia does things correctly in many aspects and auction games are just his natural talent. After many years, I still play this and it impresses me. There is a lot of player interactions and subtle strategies. It is not as simple as "bid n-1 where n is the prospected value". This is the game you must use various auctions for your benefit.

Fairly enjoyable auction game, but I really dislike the abruptness with which a player can end a round when he or she is the only one who benefits from it.  Also, getting dealt lots of double auction cards without matches for them seriously hurts your ability to make money off your opponents.  I strongly recommend a house rule stating that a player who gets dealt more than X (you decide) double auction cards at the beginning of the game can demand a redeal.

After multiple plays I can better see what people are raving about.  At first the game seems like a dull mathematical exercise.  Then you realize that the math is really all relative to each players' standing - so it's really a rather complex multi-faceted mathematical exercise.  Not to mention the psychology of riding the fads and trying to read what others have in their hands.

Solid.

---update--

Even better than solid.  The ups and downs this game can draw out of the participants during play solidifies Modern Art's place in the highest tier.

--update--
...or rather, reaffirmation.  After playing twice consecutively last night in which the two games had very different flows I have solidified Modern Art's place amongst my highest rated games.  Must must must have!

--update--

OMG this game is amazing with 3!  Every auction is of critical importance.  It's crazy how a game that can feel almost casual with 4 turns into a brain-burner when you remove one player.

Very fun and can get loud with all sorts of bidding going on, and that's pretty much why I like it.  It incorporates four different kinds of bidding found in other games and a somewhat similar "Manila stock market system".  The plastic money chips are great and the hiding screens too.

However, its theme was what permanently removed it from the shelves.  It wasn't aesthetically pleasing to me and like I said, the theme was boring.

Auction game with a lot of strategy involved.  The way the rounds ended with a certain amount of paintings being sold gives people the ability to end rounds when they choose, or make rounds go longer.  The different types of auctions also kept it interesting and different with artists being worth more or less depending on how many paintings were sold also gave players control of when to sell for most profit.

I auctioned paintings that I knew were going to be valuable during what I thought to be key moments. I wound up coming in second, which was a surprise.

RATING: 4
Bored me to death before my first turn.

Just auctions, for the sake of auctions. Does not even give that joy of devious long-term planning and punching your fellow players in the guts, which is present in games like Magellan or Traumfabrik.

The new lautapelit.fi edition has very nice paintings but the colors of the suits are chosen very badly: There is purple, a pair of yellows, and a pair of bluish gray. The sketchy cartoony graphics on the player screens and the box cover are a disappointment; Certainly not something you'd expect after seeing the cards. Also, the player screens tip over extremely easily.

Finally played this and it is a great game. Very simple elegant design, that is engrossing for everyone. I can tell that there is a lot more strategy to discover in this as I play it more.

RATING: 7
Elegant auction game with an intriguing theme and good components (I play Lautapelit.fi edition). There seems to be a lot more strategy in this game than I was expecting. However, there is also a bit too much luck. Well, I guess I do not mind that as the game is short enough. I use poker chips and play with open money. Rating might go down but that remains to be seen. Right now I want to play more, much more that is.

RATING: 9
Auction game in the Knizia way -there's some luck of the draw and, as usual in the genre, its success depends slighty on the balance of the players involved. Nonetheless, several kinds of auction and just four card deals throughout a play makes Modern Art a consistent, concise and moderately complex though not dry game. It's so smooth that the novice will surely feel confident straight from the first round... to get hopelessly beaten up by the end of the game, and then try again immediately.

RATING: 9.5
A devilishly difficult exercise in determining market values; far more streamlined and authentic than Power Grid (the game's nearest relative), but with a mind-melting set of variables. Simple enough to act as a gateway, but complex enough to take a lifetime to master. Play it with a different group, and you'll encounter a subtly different game, which is the best way to appreciate the depth of this one.

Lots of bidding. Harder to determine values than in Medici. UPDATE: Finally got this to the table for a real game with our group. Holy cow, that was fun. Ranks right up there with Medici.

Of all the Knizia games I've played, this one comes across as the most thematic - you actually feel like an art dealer - and the most psychological. You're playing off each other, not trying to figure out the game. This makes it much more social than something like Ra, where everone is focused on the tile bag.

Lowered from 9 to 8.

Pure bidding game, though I find it's also just a speculation game: Set on the right horse - you're lucky. Set on the wrong one - you lose.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]The combination of a solid auction game with the role playing of our gallery owners has elevated this to become my favorite auction game (Ra and Medici are right behind). I really hope this gets a reprint with a component upgrade, I'd love to get a copy to play with my family.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a thematic Knizia game if I've ever played one, you actually feel like you are involved in an art auction due to all the conversation, negotiation and sales pitches that take place.

This game will probably be bumped to a 10 if I can get in some more plays, which will all come down to the gaming group I belong to. I don't think that this would make a great family game because if one person's bids are out of whack it throws off the balance of the game.[/i]

Some of the auctions can get a little predictable with small margins if only four artists' paintings continue to be sold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a simple and fun interactive economic game that plays best with the maximum number of players (5).  Players take turns auctioning art to the other players.  Then at the end of each round, the art from the most popular artists can be sold back to bank for a profit, whereas the art from the other artists become worthless.  The game is a balance of selling art for profit, and trying to collect art for even bigger profits.

The game comes with screens so that you can hide the amount of money that you are collecting for the winner of the game is the player with the most money.  I don't like games that use screens, and generally I avoid games that have them, but I don't mind the screens in this game.

規則:
*每位玩家100一百元，起始手牌3/4/5人時11/9/8張，錢用屏風遮住，手上的牌隱密。
*隨機起始，順時針輪流賣，手牌一定要選一張賣，由他自己來主持，放買到的玩家前面，順時針賣下去，直到任一畫家的畫出現了五張即結束(因為Double 出現也一樣)，第五張不拍賣
*每一張畫都有指定的拍賣方式，下圖玩家手上的卡片拍賣方式從左到右依序為
秘密喊價、定價、公開喊價、公開喊價、一回合競標、定價、成套賣畫
>Open -- 公開競價
任何人都能自由喊價，手上也必需有那麼多錢，主持人也能參與，沒有人喊價，主持人零元拿，
賣畫的錢歸主持人所有，若是主持人買則將錢給銀行，這一條規則也適用於Round, Sealed 和Fixed 
>Round (Once around) -- 一回合競標
由主持人左邊的人開始喊價，順時針繞一圈，可以選擇棄權，也可以喊一個價，主持人為最後一個喊價
>Sealed -- 秘密喊價（暗標）
每一個人(包括主持人)從暗中拿錢在手上同時亮出，如果最高價平手，則由主持人左手邊算下去最近的那一個人得標，除非主持人也出最高價，則由主持人得標。
>Fixed -- 定價
主持人出一個定價，這個價必須低於主持人手上的錢，順時針問有沒有人要買，都沒有人接受必須自己買下
>Double -- 成套賣畫
Double的畫有兩種賣法:
一）主持人拿出一張Double，再配上另一張同畫家但非Double的畫作，兩張一起賣。
    	賣法則依第二張的種類。
二）主持人拿出一張Double，從左邊按順序願不願意參加，必須打出一張同畫家但非Double的畫作，如果一圈下來都沒人願意的話，則主持人能免費得到那一張畫，否則參加人變成新的主持人，以第二張畫的賣法賣畫，賣得的錢由對分，奇數的話，多出的一元由新的主持人得到，如果是舊的主持人買下則付一半給行、一半給新主持人，奇數多出的一元給新主持人，新主持人買下的話也是一樣，只是要把奇數多出的一元給銀行
***注意：兩人合作賣出兩張畫後，下一個由新主持人左邊的人開始賣畫，中間的人全被跳過！
*回合結束 -- 結算
回合結束後開始結算畫價，按出現畫的數目(平手左邊贏)放30/20/10元籌碼放在對應回合數上，標碼就是畫的價值，所有的面前畫依標碼的價格賣給銀行，移除遊戲(沒錢的也是)
*下一回合 先補牌，3/4/5人補6/4/3張，第四回合不補，由上一回合結束遊戲者的左邊那一個人先開始
*第二回合之後，如果畫家這一回合擠入前三名，前面回合的畫價累計

I didn't like this game as it seems to be almost pure arithmetic and raw evaluation with a little bit on hand management thrown in. 

I don't know what people see in this game, I'm sure it's just me missing something, but I can't get enthused about either the theme or the game mechanics.

NB. It is easier to understand the game if you view it as a stock market game - the company that sells the most stocks is more valuable.

2004 Mayfair edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Modern Art's been played a bit, 13 times. You don't have a choice about who to sell to. The auction dictates. So here the trash talk is fun in bidding your wares up, especially if you throw in some imagination in describing the paintings. But it's also a game I don't rate highly, reason following. The aim is to get the value up in the cards you hold most of and sell for max dollars (play your doublers) when the value is highest. But you only have one fifth (fourth, third) opportunity at directing long term value in the artists you're holding. You're pretty much at the whim of the other plays as to where and when the artists you want get driven up, and that largely depends on what people hold most of (around the table) in the first (and second) round, as they'll set the first benchmarks. So the more we played this, the more we became able to correctly value potential value (based on player psychology, cards played, ownership so far, etc), then the more that chance became a determinant in the final round when values were highest - did you have more cards for the highest valued artists in your hand than the other players. And if you sold one less card than other players in the final round, the lost $40k can be game determining, as well as if your doubler was in a weak artist due to the vagaries of the play. You could count money along the way and bid accordingly, but I know the other players aren't. So, whilst fun to play, we've moved on from this as well, apart from the occasional nostalgia play.

Picked up the new edition for around $17.  Definitely worth it -- I've wanted a copy of this ever since I read the rules online.  Simple, easily grasped concept and a good connection between theme and rules -- rare in a Knizia game.  The new, smaller box in this edition is great, though I have to say the inner 'card' tray really feels like it was designed for a completely different game -- the money discs end up sliding everywhere.  Really looking forward to trying this one when I get enought people together.

I do see the point many respected reviewers make when saying the poor play of a player can ruin the game or perhaps hand the game to someone.  I can also see that poor card draws can be a factor.  But none of that bothers me much.  There are some variants that make sure each player has access to his/her fair share of double auction cards so the card draw factor can be mitigated.  And as to the newbie player ruining the game, if you are playing with newbies it should be about having fun more than winning.  Once everyone is up to speed, the personalities of the players contributes as much to the game as the rules do and this makes the game replayable and better than many other auction/bidding games.  There is a lot of skill in picking the correct auction at the correct time and so hand management, another of my favorite game mechanisms, can play a huge role.  You may take a loss on a painting just to set up opportunity for a future round.  This is simply a classic euro that is able to get out of the way of the players.  

And a further note: the new CMON reprint is one of the best reprints I have ever seen. You could spend hours just looking at the cards.

When I originally learned this game, I could not figure out what paintings were worth and I either paid too much for them or didn't buy them when I should.  In both cases I lost.  As time goes by, I seem to be getting better with painting valuation, but I'm still not winning the game.  Even so, I almost always have a great time playing!  With the right group of people who get into the role of auctioneer, this is way more fun than it ought to be.

I first bought this in 2008 and rated it a 10. In 2015 it is still a 10.  It is a hit in my family, and with dedicated gamers also.  For a mere deck of cards and bag of chips, strategy is subtle and deep.  The design of this game design is straightforward: on your turn you select a card from your hand and auction it to the other players.  I think the reason for its amazing success is that there is a lot of luck here, but the luck is not so obvious to see because the auctions dominate the game. Winning requires good choices in the auctions, and also assessing the probability of drawing favorable cards.

Thoughts on strategy and tactics: the tactical game is to try to make the most money by selling paintings when its your turn.

The strategic game only became apparent to me after many plays: observe and manipulate other players' incentives. Launch artists in the early rounds with doubles. With good strategy you can end up with a hand of very valuable cards in the 3rd and 4th rounds that players will bid aggressively for. There is a powerful zero-sum pattern here too: your opponents might find the cards they hold to be less valuable than yours. If you have saved open-auction cards of the highly placed artists for the 3rd and 4th rounds, you have a good chance of winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Modern Art is an auction-lover's auction game.  This card-based game contains a variety of different auction types, including once-around auctions, free-form bidding auctions, blind in-the-fist auctions, and fixed "I name the price and the first person who accepts gets it" auctions.  Unlike other auction games, you can reasonably deduce what things will actually be worth, though your hand of cards gives you a little extra information, especially if you are soon in the turn order.  Like many auction games with auctioneers, this one can be a bit fragile if an inexperienced player cedes too much value to the auctioneer.  Also, the "double" cards are inherently more powerful, and getting a disproportionate number of them can put a player at an advantage.  Still, this is an enjoyable game.

TRY Jan/05: Played once; decent fun, but group-dependent.  We pigeonholed ourselves into just 3 artists EVER getting auctioned; wasn't valuable to the auctioneer to put up anything else.  We played with 4, but I think it'd be better with 5, or with LESS cards each.

When I first saw this game played on a gaming night at a table next to me the people seemed to have so much fun with it, they cheered and laughed - this was enough selling point for me and I went and bought it very soon after that (probably the next day). And I was not wrong - this game is very lively and emotional and has a good pace. Definitely the most fun I´ve had with auctions in board game format. This game is all about auctions - 5 different types of them. After 30 plays or so the hotness of this game weared off for me so I don´t play it so much anymore. Still 30 is a good number for a game with ~45 minute length and I wholly recommend it! Only gripe I have had with this game from the beggining is how ugly the game looks - but it is only a minor concern since the game itself is awesome.

This sat on the shelf for a long time, the theme just seemed so droll.  But this is awesome.  It has the clever mechanics expected from Knizia, but the true fun comes from the auctions.  On your turn you are the auctioneer, you're the boss.  An extremely social experience with a lot of fun table talk.  Brilliant.

This is one of the greats! The undisputed king of all auction games. 

It's a subtle game of group think manipulation. The perfect modern art player must be able to read the other players' minds.

It's incredible how much game you can get with such simple rules and components. If anyone has any doubts that Reiner Knizia is a genius make them play Modern Art!

A great example of what can be achieved with a fairly simple deck of cards and not much else... /if/ you're Reiner Knizia!  A pearl of a game, creating and exploiting markets for hilariously bad art
For extra fun, all pictures auctioned should have pretentious titles!

RATING: 7
A game which clearly has some deep tactics and ways to win. I just didn't care to think about them too much. Game is potentially one of the best auction games ever, but I'm not too fond of it.
One thing that I appreciate are the various auction styles. That so many ways of auctioning are combined in one game is a clever idea.
The game is ok, but nothing that I want to return to too often.

I like this better than some of Knizia's other auction games, because it has the purest economy. At auction, you need to figure out what things are worth to you. And you also need to manipulate the market to make sure that those valuations are ultimately correct.

Interesting little bidding game.... but it failed to impress us a whole lot. Bits and cards are a little disappointing -- especially for a game that focuses on an art. 

The mechanics of it are decent (both as multi-player and with the two-player variant) but it's just so hard to get past the production value. A new edition with decent art would do a lot to help this game.

For a quick filler, this one sure did a good job of teaching me about relative valuation.  The first part of the game was too rote and mathy, until I realized 'hey, it's not what it's worth, it's what it's worth to me!' because I wasn't getting a single thing.  Then the game got zany and awesome.

After first play it is no surprise to me anymore that people on BGG said this one of the classic auction games out there in the market. It is a very mathy  game just like any other Knizia's games but this one is pretty deep! I can see inexperience gamers will probably make the mistake of giving the next player the win especially in the 4th round. If we all play together as a group and grow together it might work out. 

This is one of Knizia's best and probably his best auction game.

---- Update ----
This game can't be played with too many new players or else the market will be very messed up.

Rating drops from 9 to 8 because Colosseum seems to scratch the auction itch and it has trading on top of that. I no longer feel amazed by this game.

I'm a sucker for auction games, but this game is DRY for anyone else. Structurally, I rate it high, but the theme is pasted on to the point of offensiveness. You could be buying bobbleheads, or post-it notes for all anyone cares. Nothing specifically indicates how the theme is woven into the mechanic, and that makes me sad.

Nice pure auction game--I love having the choice of what kind of auction to run and how best to manipulate the market.  However, too much of the game is solvable through boring mental accounting, e.g. of roughly how much money another player has made and how much you can afford to pay them for a work that pays off within a predictable range.

Mordern Art is a classic in every sense.  You spend the first few plays kind of lost why who won what and why and after you get past that, you move onto trying to understand everyone's motives and how manipulate the market.  This game would be better if a strategy guide was included with the game.  Not anything super long but much is lost if people don't know how to valuate paintings and manipulate the market.  For that reason, it fires on all cylinders in a competitive group but misfires and can bungled with people that don't fully understand the game and put in bad bids at auction. The winner is the person that understands the group dynamics and sees how to best make his paintings the most valuable and knows which paintings are undervalued at auction.   I won games where I buy almost everything and games where I buy almost nothing.  The game really shines due to group dynamics and all its flaws can be due to group dynamics.  The only thing outside of the play that people might criticize is that it isn't an overtly social  game like a deduction game like Werewolf or Avalon.  It is a tense, competitive game that will provide a few laughs over the bad modern art and a few more when someone gets screwed and all their paintings become worthless.  Great auction game if you are into auctions.

Time to change my comments about this strange little, "Modern Art" game.  In a nutshell - it's my favourite auction game.  It takes a bit of explaining to understand some of the nuances of the game, but once it's grasped it can be a heck of a lot of fun.  My only caveat with the game is: noone is allowed to spend more on a painting than it's 'maximum possible value' - as to help curb any possible kingmaking.  Last game I played was with 6, I was the only guy who knew how to play, but everyone who joined in found it to be an excellent time.  A very good game, for a very reasonable cost, in a small box. 

As a side note:  this is not much like For Sale! at all.  There is definately more thinking involved, as players have direct influence over the values of the cards in the deck - in regards to what is going to be auctioned off and how much it will be 'worth' at the same time.  It is [i]that[/i] key difference that makes this the real champion of 'auction' games, with plenty of exciting table-talk.

Pretty good game, although not as incredible as I'd have hoped.  Just auctions, wish there was another mechanism to add to the game.

Makes a great next-step-up for gamers who have enjoyed For Sale but would like to try something a bit meatier.

WARNING: The Mayfair reprint (2004?) is of mediocre quality. The cards are ok (though black-bordered, so a candidate for card sleeves), but the board & player screens are thin cardboard and the plastic chips aren't too great (we use some other numbered chips).

Auction game for gamers - love it.  It's definitely a game where strategies develop over time after several plays.

My only gripe is that it takes a little too long sometimes and I think this is the fault of the "open" auctions.  Maybe we need to use an egg timer or something?

Edit: Played this again recently and there are quite a few in our gaming group who don't seem to like it for some reason.  A shame really, because I love it.

One of the best auction games. It offers some tactical and strategical plays and constantly confronts you with making tough choices. However, the game is not all strategy and tactics, and randomness plays a role, which gives it a 'casino game' feel. You almost get the same fun and enjoyment of casino gambling without the smoke or risking real money!

Of the 3 bidding games from Knizia this is the best.  First, it has the feel of a real auction (unlike Ra).  It does not have the calculation slow down sometimes found in Medici.

I was resistant to the idea of playing a Reiner Knizia game for a while, because someone so prolific and popular couldn't possibly be that good. Then I played Modern Art, and it was a sublime wonderment to experience. While I've had some hit or miss experiences with some of his games (ones which common consensus has damned to history), it seems that his bigger hits are pure objects of game design.

If more paintings by Gitter sell, Gitter paintings can be sold for more. The more they sell, the more you buy, and the more you sell them for. An auction game where the prices are driven up by demand in a way that is so easy to understand that the game is just brilliant. 

The European language 2009 edition has beautiful graphic design and art that really makes the game objet d'art.

Auction games are the generally difficult to get started. It is hard to value the bids, It usually takes a few plays to asses the value.  
Modern Art has several things going for it. The value of the auction is relatively apparent by watching the purchase chits, and yes you can game the other players by cashing out on item, but the range of possibilities are there.
I like the multiple kinds of auctions - it provides for variety. 
Finally the game is thematic - you do feel like you are trying to convert an unknown (and pretty bad one at that) artist into a highly desirable one.

Was quite impressed by first play of this. Played with CMON's newest version. 

This is a smart auctioning game that plays a little oddly. At first most of us assumed that like most games the main way to get money would be to buy things in the auctions that would later sell for more. And while that is one way to get money, the math suggests the real way to win this game is to be putting up for auction the most valuable art each round. And that leads to a very interesting game of trying to use your hand of art to put forth the artwork that will set up huge sales in later rounds, netting you the most profit. 

Of course a bit of profit can still be made through all the various auctions, and because of the round to round scoring it can be hard to know what the art will sell for exactly. Everyone's bids start to reveal little bits of information they know about their hand which starts to influence how the game will play out. 

Ultimately what I'm trying to say is that with relatively few rules the game is pretty deep and quite open to mathematical analysis which are features I like. There is plenty of player interaction with the others in the auctions and it leads to a fun time. This is a game I'll happily play some more.

RATING: 4
UPDATE Feb 2011, finally played a full game of this; I rated this game last in Feb 2006.

Downgrade from 6 to 4.

It's a refreshing change to play a Euro that's not a bloated mess that we have today, caused by the inexplicable popularity of worker placement games.

Still, this game is very meh.

It's a game that rewards the person who's willing to put the time to calculate the value of what each card is, which is quite possible in Modern Art. So I suppose fans of calculation intensive yet low interaction games like Power Grid are also big fans of Modern Art.

I say low interaction because it's really all about trying to put a numerical object on a value. There's no mechanism to manipulate how opponents will play; you simply have to predict how they will behave. That might be a valid and interesting form of interaction; I find it bland anti-social.

There is some tension in hoping that an opponent doesn't suddenly end a round by playing the first fifth card of an artist, but usually that's a matter of luck; the player who holds the most equals sign cards (and knows how to use them properly) usually does the best.

=============================


Tentative rating for 1/2 a a game. 

Mayfair components suck. Why couldn't they've substituted all the chips and playing board with cards and thus make the game more portable?

VERY impressive amount of player control on every aspect of the game. If the game components (especially the art and card design) were better, this might score a 8.5. As it is, the gameplay is strong, but the theme/components don't make me want to go out of my way to play it. If it was more compelling, the gameplay would deserve an 8.

A bit on the heavy side for some in our group, but great fun for the more serious crowd, especially those with a more mathematical bent.  As an avid auction-goer, I also should add that the game mechanics really reflect the auction "experience" very well.  

I'm hoping to get this out a few more times in the group so that more people get a feel for it. I think it will end  up being fairly popular, but it may take a bit of time for some of the lighter gamers to warm up to it.

While I'm not that great at auction games in general, this one gave me a bit more trouble. The fact that you have to decide on what to auction vs what to bid is what got to me, I think. While I'm not interested in playing it again soon, I will give it another chance, which will hopefully help me understand it better.

RATING: 6
My first game, 5-player, I won 442 to 325 to everybody else below 299, and I don't know what I was doing, and nobody else explained it very well either.  It was sorta fun, I guess, although mostly mathematical mechanics that had little to do with the 'theme' of the game.  I'd play it again if there were no other new games to try, but there isn't much to it to get me to ask for it again.

To think I saw this in Germany a couple of years ago and didn't buy it. Had to make do with the new, non-thrill version that is STILL a rip-off in Australia. Fabulous bidding game that creates enormous tension and anxiety. It remains up there with Ra as one of Knizia's finest. The different bidding mechanics (hidden, once around, etc) make for an intriguing game. Difficult to play with new players who have a tendency to over bid and stop the round with bad art plays.

Modern Art does a very good job of making me tense just like most other good auction style games.  After one play though, I'm not really sure what all the other players were thinking about for so long.  I liked the mechanics of the different types of auctions.  It game the game a lot of variety and I liked the way that pieces of art (cards) were valued, but I did not enjoy the atmosphere that was created as we played the game.  Perhaps it is just that I don't care enough about winning or maybe I am too impulsive, but Modern Art seems like it would be a lot more fun if played more socially.  Perhaps I'll have to try to get a play in with a more social group and see if I enjoy it more.

A true auction game.  This game benefits from players of similar experience levels to balance the auctions and increase the selling strategy.  The game can change significantly depending on how a single equal auction is handled (split profit or all profit to second seller).

RATING: 7
This one has trouble competing with Ra for time on the table.  Oddly, Ra's mechanic of limiting a player's bid amounts makes it a little easier to grasp than Modern Art, which is certainly a more straightforward theme.  Unlike Ra, which is at its best with three players, Modern Art is in its element at four or five.

I'm docking my copy of modern art a full point because it's so damn ugly! My god, why do european publishers think it's acceptable to release games that look WORSE than if they were just black and white card stock?

As for the mechanics, the multiple types of bids is interesting but isn't enough to really grab anyone. If it used one of those systems in relation to another mechanic, maybe. As is, like Money, feels like an experiment, not a full game. Not a good one at least.

Muito, muito simples e básico, muito básico para ocupar um lugar de tão grande destaque no ranking do BGG. Mas pronto, tal como o génio de Almada Negreiros, que se manifestava em não se manifestar, Arte Moderna é um jogo discreto, de um Knizia que já fazia grandes coisas mas ainda não tinha chegado aos camelos (Através do Deserto). Não sou grande apreciador de jogos onde o dinheiro é que dá a vitória (Chinatown e Top Race são outros exemplos, ainda que não tão expropriadores quanto Hotel ou Monopoly), talvez por isso não me preencha as medidas, no entanto, reconheço o seu valor, ainda que lhe alterasse algumas regras para que fosse mais matemático e concreto.

RATING: 8.7
Players: 3-5
Time: 45 min.

Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles. You do this by putting a painting from your hand up for auction each turn. You get the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if you buy it for yourself. After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings from that artist that were sold. The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner. A clever game of market speculation and manipulation.

RATING: 8
Modern art is a beautifully stripped down game of the free market.  Two parties exchange goods for the betterment of both parties.  If you think a game centered solely on mutual benefit would make a lousy competitive game, you're probably right.  So Knizia throws in two beautiful, simple curves into the equation:  1.  The value of paintings in the future is variable and depends solely on the market transactions people choose to make.  2.  Different auction methods allow people to determine a certain bias as to who will win the painting cheaply, or who will need to spend a lot to get a painting.  

What all this boils down to is a game that involves thinking about everyone else more than yourself.  You must decide, from a very analytical view, what people want, what they are willing to do for it, and how you can use their goals to your own advantage.  It's a beautiful system of cooperation for maximum private gain.

(+) Acheives freeform auction in purest form.  
(+) Brilliant elements of card play that can add twists to valuation of art.  
(+) High player interaction and demands keen attention from all players involved.  

(-) Strategic choices are oddly, consistently opaque. It feels rather tricky to play correctly heuristically, which is something I have come to enjoy from most typical purdue auction games.
(-) Pure auction and nothing else, and so the repetitive nature of the turn structure can be a turn off.  
(-) Publishing effort is a mixed bag. Good card art, unusually fiddly choice of currencies.

At one time this was my favorite game, but I haven't played it much lately.  More play could easily bring this rating back to a 9 or 10.

Woooooaaaaahhhhhhhhhh.... It's important to understand that this game is not just about playing the numbers, but about manipulating the whole game-flow. 

You can play by the numbers, or you can push around the market and make a big score by selling at the end.

The majesty of this design blows my mind. Imagine what it would be like without the cumulative build of scoring from round to round, or what it would be if you didn't get most of your cards up front. 

NOTE: years later, I'm still playing this, still loving this, and I dig it so much that it's the centerpiece for a paper I'm writing about game aesthetics and perfect game design.

RATING: 6
Surprisingly, a bidding/auction game that I love.  The key is that bidding/auction is all there is in this game, so there no other aspect to distract from its core.  But for all that I love it, it still takes time to get an appreciation for the value of paintings and knowing what to bid.  I have a tendency to overbid in this game, so while making good income each round, I tend to spend it all with the result of poor cash growth.  I expect to get better with more playings, but frustrating at first.  If others are not prepared for this learning curve, the game can leave a bad taste in the mouth and discourage further plays.

 A truly classic auction game with a strong theme. Simple mechanics, an incredibly deep gameplay and hard to master. My only gripe is that it's also a very fragile game, can be easily unbalanced by bad plays from the more inexperienced players, and to a much lesser extent from bad card draws.
 Best with four players, not as random as five, not too easy to chase one given player as with three.

This is a very curious and very successful auction board game. For us, its theme doesn´t matter (as usual in Reiner Knizia´s games...), although this game is OK in this point. Production design is superb, and very brave if we consider the conservative fashion that nowadays prevails when illustrating a board game. So far, it's the best auction board game I've ever tried. It's a lot of fun, and there´s certain strategy involved. We´ve mainly played with 4 players, and we love it. Moreover, this new edition has excellent quality for its price (CMON have done a very good job here!), and as I said before, this edition of this old game is beautiful. If you like auctions and Contemporary Art, it´s highly recommended!

I can see why people consider it the essential auction game, but I don't find auction games particularly interesting where it is so easy to directly correlate what you are spending on something and what you expect to get in return. Knowledge of what's in your hand creates some different expectations about how much a color will be worth, but essentially cards are not of different value to different players.  I prefer auction games where players vary in what value they get out of what they're bidding on, and that that value is not that same thing they are bidding (unlike money for money, or points for points).  Thematically, the art is just really boring and it doesn't feel like we are bidding on art at all, so I would just as well have it completely abstract like Coloretto.

Only played this once so far, but I really enjoyed it. So much is going on that I know I haven't gotten my head around all the possibilities yet. Great game. 

This has now been one of the most played games in the last 6 months for my groups. Its a ton of fun. Its easy to teach, but can be brutal on your ego.

RATING: 6
Under normal circumstances, I would rate this game a 6.  The theme is so-so and whenever I play, I get a sense that my success in the game has very little to do with how I play.  Instead, it all depends on what your opponents do.  Obviously, by recognizing this, my strategy should change from game to game (or opponent to opponent), however I can not figure out that winning formula.  This confusion/frustration intrigues me, keeps me coming back, and gives Modern Art an extra bump up to a 7 out of 10. 

Another point - I know of a few gamer friends who absolutely love this game.  This causes me to search for the greatness in this game that I enevitably can't see.

The way you appraise the art is neat.  Lack of a $10,000 denomination chip is annoying.

--05Aug2004-- Really nice game.  And my family likes it too!
The best part, of course, is the whole groupthink dynamic:  when with a bunch of people that all bid irrationally high, you're going to lose unless you bid above a rational comfort zone.  Equally, with a bunch of conservative bidders, a degree of accomodation is needed.  What's more, while the old one is unquestionably nicer, the new Mayfair version - in my highly overrated opinion - is entirely playable and a great value for the money.

I like this one alright, but I never have a feel for who is going to win.  Most of the time, I feel like the amount of money in the game is way too high.  I really enjoy the different tyoes of auctions and won't often turn down the offer to play.

We played our first four-player game last night.  By the third auction season, we all were starting to "get it" and by the final season we were having fun.  Overall, I enjoyed this game.

In spite of my true hatred for bidding games where the auctioneer gets the money from the auction, Knizia has found a way to make that mechanic central to the whole game. Its really nothing but a bidding game, but there is an interesting subtlety trying to make the auctions you run worth the most.

A fragile game, you need the right group, and you need to do a good job explaining how the money flows and give new players a general idea about what a bid--when given to another player--will do to the game. With the right group, Modern Art can be a raucous good time.

Pretty cool game, very thematic, although Knizia has so many excellent auction games it's hard to pick a favorite. I think I still prefer Medici, Ra, and Amun Re to this game, but that may change with more plays. Regardless, it's a great game and I'm glad to see it back in print with better production values because its easier for me to get people to try it..

But seriously, it is!

This game can be VERY group dependent, which is why it doesn't earn a higher rating.  With the right group, it's brilliant.  The wrong people can break the game (either with over-paying or under-paying) or just through not "getting into" the game.  I love running an auction and wheedling the last possible coin out of someone!  I love it even more when everyone at the table gets into that same way!

Like Lost Cities, Lord of the Rings, and Tigris & Euphrates, Modern Art is a game where my first experience was not indicative of the games brilliance. I originally worried this was too fragile, allowing enthusiastic bidders to throw the game by pumping too much money toward the other players. I've shifted on this in two directions. First of all, I no longer need a game to require the players to play well. Secondly, that fragility works in the game's favor thematically, where falling for the hype only helps your opponents. This is a brilliant bidding game, highly thematic and very nuanced. It's one of Knizia's best.

The new edition from CMON is so much better than the last Mayfair edition that it's a little silly. It's one of my favorite board game productions out there right now.

Awesomely thematic auction game. My only complaint is that a hand full of Double Auction cards in a single color with no other paintings in that color can spell disaster. Outside of this admittedly rare scenario, the game is great.

I think this issue might could be fixed by allowing mulligans on the first hand, but maybe that's too much?

Owned and enjoyed for many years, then sold because I was an idiot in a bad mood. Recently paid $$$ to get the pictured 1996 version that I am used to back in my collection. One good thing about capping your collection, games that you like go up in personal value--that is, it is easier to justify spending a lot of money to get a game into your collection. You only have so many, so there's no danger of spiraling out of control. I would pay $100 for this version, easy.

don't know why I like it so much--we like to pretend that we are snobby art dealers, pawning this crap off on the other unsuspecting players. Of course, we're as likely to hose ourselves as them if we're not careful.

Love the pictures, pretending I knew Crypto's mother, which 'explains things' if you know what I mean.

My fandom's a mystery to me! The good Dr. Knizia does it again, confusing my understanding of my own preferences!

All auctions, all the time. A staggering work of heartbreaking genius. Mayfair version is ugly as sin and an affront to this fine game.

There's a rules change between the German and English versions:

"The Mayfair version of the game published in the United States modified the German rules so that when a player completes a double auction card played by another player, the sale price is divided between each player who played a card. The original German rules (which I prefer) have the entirety of the sale price going to the player who plays the SECOND card."

BGG has lost my comments on this one, but I seem to remember saying something along the lines of it being a good game if players are experienced and make appropriate valuations. Where the game breaks down is if a player upsets this balance and starts to make absurd bids. That'll throw off the balance of the game between all the players and the game will degenerate into a pointless exercise for the affected players.

The best game of auctions and only auctions.  Players are gallery managers speculating with art and making profit out of it.

This is a great game with a couple of features that really annoy me. The different auctions types make player seating more important without seeming to add much to the game.

Auction games are difficult (especially for new players) because it's hard to figure what things are worth in the context of the scoring.  But this game presents this problem in a very unique way - instead of the items bid on having a fixed value (like say Ra or Medici), the players' choices in Modern Art are what determine the value of the items they've bid on.  And I find it so hard to wrap your head around how paying for a painting affects your position in the game.  The best auction game around, in my opinion.

I've never been a tremendous fan of bidding games. This grand-daddy of auctioneering features four different kinds of bidding systems: open, sealed, once-around, and fixed (also double auctions, but they're just one of the other four types but with a lot of two items). Definitely a good game if you're a auction game purist. UPDATE: Dropping from 8 to 7. I just don't like pure bidding games enough, I never offer to bring this to the table. Still, I see value in the game; you should ignore my rating if you love auction games.

Sell your paintings for maximum gain, buy paintings you think will become valuable (but don't spend too much unless you're cooperating with the seller), and use the double paintings wisely.

After my 2nd play (and this time with experienced [floatleft][imageid=536712][/floatleft]opponents), I can see why this is so popular. It helped that I also took a class on auction theory in between my 1st and 2nd plays. Very computational, and you can even develop implicit alliances in the game. I like it, though it might be too opaque and unintuitive for non-gamers or new players. I prefer teaching Ra to newbies because its intuitive auctions are easy to teach, but will play this anytime because the mechanism-heavy auctions offer something entirely different. A gamers' game.

I printed out my homemade deck featuring real artwork through Artscow. Bittersweet memories: it kept me occupied after my mind-blowing trip to Europe (and its art museums), when I came back to the reality of unemployment in a hostile time for new graduates..

Scandinavian edition.

The ultimate auction game.  Nicely designed.  We started off loving this game (4 of us played several sessions), then decided that the strategy was too predictable, took a break from it, came back and re-discovered the surprisingly deep complexity.  I often find myself winning at the beginning of the last round, only to blow it when the paintings start selling for massive amounts.  Requires more planning and thinking than you might expect.  A great game for any collection (and easy to teach to non-gamers!).

The Scandinavian edition features "real" art by 4 artists.  Some of the art is quite good, some is horrendous, but the overall production value of this version is quite high.  

5-4-14 (update):  I am upping my rating of this game to an 8.0.  After years on my shelf and numerous plays with different groups, I've decided it's just a genius design that keeps on giving.  There is so much strategy here, so much social psychology, so much intensity.  Love it.

Modern Art -- I find that mixing different types of auction makes the game both entertaining and somewhat suspenseful.  And carrying previous values into new rounds adds an interesting dynamic.  Still, I find that Modern Art falls just short of my upper tier of auction games.  I suspect that may be due to a flaw in my own abilities rather than in the game itself. I'd love to have a copy of Arte Moderna (the Brazilian version published by Odysseia Jogos, with art by Mike Doyle).

[i]Update 30 Sep 2009[/i]:  Masters Gallery (Modern Art: The Card Game) pares away the auctions (and thereby the connection with the theme) and leaves an elegant, satisfying filler.

Considering how much I disliked Ra (edit: initially) and have overall tendencies of avoiding Knizia's games whenever possible, it surprised me how much I enjoyed Modern Art. And I won against eurogaming crowd, who were lost in the groupthink, mwahaha. (Prices went up in speculative bubble and I just sold and rarely bought.) I love groupthink games as it makes it harder to evaluate and make optimal moves (well, you can, but each time dependant on groupthink). It reminded me of stock market games (stock being cards you have in your hand) which have similar dynamics, but this one is lighter and easier to learn. The logic behind it seems a bit similar to Genoa, though here I managed to win by not going into bidding wars and exploiting the groupthink instead of just riding with it. The pegasus edition art is lovely and helps get the theme come across and getting players in the right mood. My GF loved it as well, and as we do work in the field of art, this looks like something I'll acquire my own copy of very soon.

The challenge that each auction type brings to the table coupled with the volatility of the market is brilliant. The grand strategy of this game still eludes me – I'm still torn on what is the best price to offer for a painting, especially since the payment goes to the seller rather than the bank. Each auction type is also challenging, with fixed-price auctions being the most difficult to call.

Confess to be baffled by the high ratings for this game, perhaps because for a lot of people it was a gateway game. Or perhaps I should revisit it after many years, but I recall being fairly indifferent to it's charms. *UPDATE* Now revisited, and can see the Knizian cleverness. But not rushing to play again either.

Got this in a trade. It has auctions. The art on the cards is ugly. Maybe I can take my Masterpiece cards and use them for Modern Art. Then I might actually play it. Though it would still have auctions, so maybe I won't play it. Then again . . .

#29 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Such a genius little auction game. Knizia hit it out of the park with this one. I know gamers that don't like auction games that say they enjoy this one. The theme of auctioning off and bidding on paintings doesn't seem like it would be that appealing, but people have gotten into each time I've played. At least one person ends up adopting a haughty, foreign accent.

Modern Art, as many others have pointed out, is just a paragon of creating a game that plays very, very well on a very, very spare skeleton. If you love auctions, you are probably going to rate this higher than I have. I enjoy auctions games, but am not crazy about them. I also don't feel that the game gives players enough opportunities to make interesting plays or plan and execute a strategy. There is a lot of auction game here, and I put it solidly in my "enjoyable, but not especially fun" category.

An excellent game, (especially while sipping on a good 'red'). Lots of guessing the worth of paintings. Love it.

Update: I was waiting for the reprint with new artwork before buying... http://mdoyle.blogspot.com/2006/03/modern-art-preview-i.html. However, the $53 price tag ($30 plus $23 S/H from Brazil) is just not worth it, even for the new artwork, when I can get the Mayfair edition for $17 from an online retailer.

I suspect theres more to this game than first meets the eye. After whining heavily about how I never win bidding games I promptly won. More luck than specifically good judgement, although I have been following a strategy of late thats aided me a little in bidding or variable resource cost games. More fun than I thought it would be, worthy of a few more tries to get a true feel of it.

Egy licitálásról szóló játék sosem lesz a kedvencem, főleg, ha csak ebből áll. A Modern Art ilyen. De mindenképpen jó játék, könnyű szabályok, gyors játékmenet és bárkivel játszható. Ez már bőven elég lenne, de a jó többféle licit és 4 kör ötlete nagyon kellemes játékká teszi. Aki szereti a licitálást, esetleg a Chinatown, Bohnanza a kedvence, az ebben a játékban sem fog csalódni.

RATING: 9
The way in which the game evokes the speculative (and frankly nearly fraudulent) nature of modern art dealing is a masterpiece in Euro game design. The real modern art used on the cards greatly enhances the theme. Basically, the theme is perfectly baked into the game and it's done in a very simple and intuitive way. It's fascinating how group psychology can dictate the value of paintings. One small issue I have is that a lot can depend on drawing the double-auction paintings which can be worth a lot in the later rounds -- relatively short playtime does mitigate this.

8.2 After playing this once, I will say this game is fantastic!  Was recommended when I posted here on BGG looking for a successor to For Sale, which we have played to death.  This one NAILED IT.  About twice the length and complexity of For Sale, it's perfect for someone looking for something a little meatier, but it's still pretty simple to play once you learn.  It did not feel like a long game, and we would gladly have played again right away if not that it was late and time for the boys to go to bed.  Great fun and interaction for anyone who likes auction games.  This one has 4 types of auctions, and choosing which one to use is part of the strategy!

Well you can say a lot of things about Reiner Knizia good and bad, but one thing that is undeniable is that this man can make a damn fine auction game.  If you like auctions this one is where it's at.  It's like a greatest hits of auctioning, incorporating all different styles, and methods.  This one has a surprising amount of depth and complexity, as there is also a hand management issue to deal with on top of the auctions.  If it weren't for the fact that the art itself wasn't SOOO ugly (in addition to the general design and chits) it would rate a 10.

Rating based on one play. I found this to be an interesting auction game, but auctions aren't my best mechanic. There seemed to be some opportunity for turn order abuse. For example, in one round Player 2 won Player 1's double auction, so he ran a double auction on the same artist that Player 3 won, and then Player 3 slapped down a fifth card from the same artist to end the season quickly. Some would call this "control", but it just didn't seem fun or thematically right when it happened.

This game is a lot of fun!! I would recommend this game to anyone who like games where you can bid on stuff. You bid on Art paintings to put in your gallery and after each seasons end,the 3 most popular artists will make money. Any other artists will make money only if they made money in a previous season. You have 5 seasons and at the end of the 5th season, the person with the most amount of money wins!

RATING: 8
Modern Art is a pure auction game that asks one simple question:  how much is that worth to you?  Each player on his turn places a work of art from his hand up for sale in an auction format.  The key is in estimating the future worth of the painting (at the end of the round).  A round ends when five paintings by the same artist have been put up for auction, so a round could be very short or very long (there are five artists).  The paintings that were purchased are all sold to the bank at the end of each round.  Paintings that are by the most popular artist (for that round) get a $30G pricetag, 2nd most popular gets $20G and 3rd gets $10G.  All others are worthless.
I like the tension of the auctions, particularly the open auctions that see players drop out early and jump back in at higher prices.  There's a fair bit of psychology to the game, especially as the seller.  You often put works up for sale that you want yourself, but not for too high a price.  As the buyer, you have to be aware that you're putting money into an opponents coffers when you win an auction, so that should inform your decision.  All in all, it's a great game that can generate a lot of laughs and BS with the right group.  Unreservedly recommended to anyone who doesn't hate auctions.

This is the most elegant and amazing auction game, and it will always be in my top 5.  There's a variety of different auctions available, so you get great variety.  Since you get to choose on your turn what to auction and make the proceeds from it - and the set of paintings already sold in the round affects how much they are actually worth - there is a vast variety of interesting decisions on your turn.  Even when bidding on other people's paintings, it's interesting to figure out if it's worth trying to buy something not yet sold on the cheap, or to pay through the nose for a work that has an artist who has already had a couple of other paintings sold.  The rules are quick and easy, and this is simply a great, great game.

We played this a bunch this last summer and are currently letting it rest a bit. Don't think we ever figured out a game winning strategy. The luck of the cards makes that tough, however a player that knows the game will usually pound a new player. So I would not say it's a complete luckfest. I really think this game plays itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the deepest pure auction game there is. The game is just a basic structure around which players create a market. Players win by manipulating market incentives to their advantage. Nothing has intrinsic value, and the market can change quickly, so it's easy to get caught up in things and overspend, as befits a game about modern art. The rules are simple, but the game is subtle and deep and interesting, and the components of the French edition are excellent. 

Critics say that the game is fragile to inexperience because one bad choice can swing the game. This is true in theory but not true of my experience. I have rarely seen players blunder too badly, at least by comparison to any other game that rewards experience. Experienced players almost always win. But I always explain the minimum and maximum value any painting may have at the beginning of each round. I emphasize in the rules explanation that you do not have to buy a painting to win the game. Intelligent opponents catch on quickly, typically too late to win, but they ask to play again. It is one of Knizia's best designs, and it's the most engrossing of his auction games, though it's not as exciting as Ra.

I've only ever had the pleasure of playing Modern Art once, but I've thought about it a lot ever since.  The opportunity has yet to present itself for further plays, but I'm eagerly awaiting that time.  Loved the first go-round.  Taking on the role of the agitated Tokyo buyer just made it all the more entertaining.  One of Knizia's very best.

Edit 01/20/2010:  Have played this a bunch more times since that initial comment, though only once (surprisingly!) in '09.  Excellent auction game, and I vastly prefer it over Ra (to which it's occasionally compared).

I don't like it that much now that I've played it more. I still find it a good way to learn about auctions.

It lacks the surprise feeling when bidding for some paintings. Players often know how much will a painting be worthing ruining all of the bidding and risking flavour.

The mechanics of this game are so elegant and appropriate, it is truly a thing of beauty. Get four or five people who know what they're doing and this could be your new all-time favorite. Fluent player interaction, perfect balance of strategy and chance (almost completely strategy), and a dash of humor make this a great. That being said, it desperately need to be republished. The cover art is a good indication as to the quality of the rest of the package. Some people say they hate the paintings. I personaly don't, and I'm a painting major, what makes this game look god-awfull is the rest of the stuff around the paintings. It needs cash money instead of chips and more attractive cards, especially the backs of the cards. Even the gallery screens are hideous. Fortunately the game is so great that it can afford to be hideous, perhaps the next edition will have more atmosphere. I'm super pissed the new ed. changed the game play. How awful.

Damn I suck at auction games. I am TERRIBLE at valuing things during them. That said, this game is GREAT. I have never had this game fall flat with a group of people, gamers or not. But, I paid less than MSRP for it and that definitely factors into that as it is not worth the price it sells for these days.

I'm not overly fond of auction in games and here it's the main focus of the game. That makes it more tolerable to me.

This game is highly dependent on the group you play with as everybody needs to be familiar with auctions type, but also their function, ratio, etc.

An interesting game ruined by lack of balance (the winner tends to be the player who gets dealt the most &#039;=&#039; cards). I know our group are in the minority, but we consider Ra and Medici to be vastly superior games.

RATING: 6.5
The biggest compliment that I can give this game is that a friend of mine, who is a self-proclaimed board game hater, played this game once with a group of buddies and promptly went out and purchased a copy.  The biggest complaint I have with this game is that, for a game about "modern art", the visual graphics are TERRIBLE (better bits could have increased my "game design" rating by a full point).  But over-all, it is a fun game and is the most interesting auction-based game that I've played due to the variety of different auction styles that are used.  I find it to be more fun and interesting than "Ra", anyhow.  And it's got some very interesting strategic depth below the surface.  I recently played a 4-player game where I purchased the vast majority of the paintings (it was quite the art monopoly!) and everyone was convinced that I had won by a long shot (including myself), but I ended up in third place, losing out to a guy who purchased only a couple of paintings but managed to sell his for quite high prices (and he beat the second place player by only a few points).  So I'm still a little puzzled by the strategy, which is good!  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Almost a "pure" auction game. Has never failed to hit the mark in my group.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Sublime auction game with a role-playing element. What I find most enjoyable is the problem, as auctioneer, of setting the maximum value at which a painting will be bought by someone else -- i.e., because it is usually more profitable to sell a painting worth 10 for 6 (gain for other plyer 4; for you, 6) than buy it yourself for 7 (gain for you, 3).

Like many auction games, it suffers somewhat with inexperienced players who under or overpay; more seriously, there is a strong turn-order binding problem where these players set fixed prices too low and help the player to the left.

It's a pity that the graphic design is so poor and, as I have come to expect from Mayfair, so are the components.

RATING: 7.5
[Mayfair 2004 edition] {Arts; auction, set collection; optimal 4p} A typical Knizia's auction game with many calculations. MA has rich player interaction and loads of fun. MA is barely luck dependent; actually I think it's a medium-weight strategy game, in which players to find a way to play the auction cards effectively to earn big money.

Even though MA involves continual calculations, general players can still master it well. However, all auction games share a similar problem: inexperienced players will spend too much in bidding and weaken themselves; as a result, riches get richer. It's even critical in MA because a player has to master many ways of auction and plan how to develop the masterpieces of an artist. Inexperienced will easily lose their mind in this game.

I have a handful of Knizia's auction games - High Society, Money!, MvS, Traumfabrik, Ra, Razzia!, previous Palazzo and this one. I can't decide which one is the best because each game is special and unique. However, I like them all! (should I get Medici, too? :devil: )

It's a game about ark work collection but the ark work of this edition is just horrible! Nicer card graphic will definitely make me love it more.  The missing of $10 chips is very troublesome.  The player screens are just too thin.  And the rulebook is of very low quality (like a photocopy with misaligned cutting).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This was way more fun than I thought it would be. Players have hidden money and can do types of bids on cards - hidden bid, fixed bid, general auction bit, or a bid around the table depending on the card. The artist that sells the first second or third most paintings in a round gets to sell those paintings and then the next round the 30 20 10 score carries over but only if that artist succeeds again. Be careful in giving too much money to other players or overbidding on a painting that won't get you enough profit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating based on 2 plays.

I've typically not enjoyed pure auction games, but this one is very good. Having the ability to choose the type of auction really makes this game. Can't wait to play again.

Modern Art earns my "ugliest game ever award" (Mayfair edition). I'm working on my own version now using real modern artists.

RATING: 7
Accomplished card-based auction game. The aim is to collect artworks from various fictional artists when they appear at auction. There are several different types of auction e.g. fixed price, hidden bid, open bid etc, and this mixture of mechanics brings a level of variety to the game that is absent from other auction games. The theme actually works well and for a game as simple as this, it mirrors the dealings of the art world really well as the popularity of particular artists fluctuates wildly and the dealer who best controls the market will be the most successful.

I'm a fan of bidding games and Knizia, what can I say...  This game is great.  It does seem a touch long for the lightness of the game, but it's an enjoyable experience.

My first game of Dr K. 

Once players understand the types of auctions in the game and going through a round to really see the potential of the manipulation of the market, the game really just shines. 

I've got to play this more, and it's more fun when players start to "role play" and do all sorts of shenanigans to mess with the market. The wife surprisingly likes the game after only one play, and she commented she caught some of the nuances towards the end of that game.

One player did say that it's a lot of guesswork, I would say it's more about inference?

One of the top three Knizia 'big' games (E&T, Modern Art, Medici) for me, and in a way all of them share a common feel: each will give you plenty to think about, are undeniably abstract in some way, and have a marked element of luck (tile draw, card deal/=, or card pull respectively). But would the games be better without this luck element? I doubt it.

RATING: 7
While I recognise its quality, this game was too loose for me.  The real problem I had was that a path to victory was not clear to me.  Because players essentially define winning conditions and points values as the game progresses, at no point did I feel in control of my own point-tally.  I'm a concrete kind of guy, I like things to be clear and I just couldn't adapt to the ever-changing values of the various artworks.  Would play it again though.

tl;dr: interesting pure auction game

There was a time when Reiner had auction game diarrhea. I just put out game after game after game with all kinds of different auction mechanisms. Most of those have just one auction mechanism, this game features five of them.
Each turn you will auction off one of the active player's cards. The card indicates what type of auction it is.
The system where the value of cards is dependent on the amount that is played and the amount scored in previous rounds, creates a very interesting dynamic.
I must say this game still works surprisingly well and certainly is one of the better pure auction games I know.
Too bad every edition of this game looks like shit!

Not my favorite Knizia Auction Game.  I like it, but Ra and Medici are better than this.  This one does have the interesting dynamic in being able to sell products to earn money instead of just making good pickups.  However, this seems heavily weighted in who gets the most double auctions and plays best to make those worth enough money in the early rounds for the big pickups in late rounds.

Modern Art is one of the most fascinating pure auction games. Despite the fact that there are multiple different types of auctions, which serve mostly to keep the game interesting as opposed to adding strategy, the economy and value of paintings is largely created by the players instead of the game mechanics. That's interesting.

This is a fun auction game that is as much psychology as it is math.  Even if you know precisely how much a painting is going to be worth, you have to decide how badly you want it, how badly others want it, and how much you can afford to give to the auctioneer before you bid.

After many plays, this game seems to get a good reaction from non-gamers, but the more I play it the more problems I find with it.

Still a great game however if all players are at a similar level.

The auction game taken to the extreme. I love the different styles of auction that the game utilises. I need to rethink my strategies somewhat, as one of our group has been winning consistently with his "sell sell sell" approach.
Edit: I've finally won a game with our group, I'll wait for a few more games before I decide whether it was due to luck or judgement!
Edit: Managed to win another game or two. I think I have the strategies down for this one, at least the way our group plays. I like the way there's so much to think about in this, despite the simple mechanics.

RATING: 6
Interesting game, but to my mind this ranks far behind other Knizia bidding games such as Ra, Traumfabrik and Amun Re. Luck of the card draw (tough to auction off valuable art if you are dealt only types not in vogue, plus the double-auction cards are overpowered and, again, it's completely random who benifits from getting them) and the vagaries of group-think (without a double-auction card, it's impossible to make a line of art valuable unless by someone else's whim) keep this from being a top-tier auction game in my book. The five different auction styles also can be a bit fiddly and doesn't help the cause. All that said, this is still a very solid design and one I'm rarely unwilling to play.

Playtester: "What do you mean "every one"?"

Reiner:

And somehow, he makes it work, and work brilliantly and smoothly and, most impressively, simply.  Only Reiner.

(My friend has a mini easel to hold the cards that are being bid.  Yeah, that's kind of now a must.)

Update: I appreciated how brilliant the design is even more on my second play.  Upping my rating.

Pure auction goodness, but beware! It relies too much on players' individuals perceptions of value to ever feel you can control your own fate. Your opponents' mindless bids provide all the entertainment and most of the frustration. The game works wonderfully as long as everyone is playing for the same reason. Don't mix the serious gamers with the silly spendaholics in this game!

This game heavily relies on the ability of the players to accurately assess the value of the paintings being auctioned. This is far from obvious and difficult for new players to grasp. Games with players of unequal experience lack subtlety and tension.

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

Auctions, anyone?  I really like the variety of auction styles included in the game.  Playing with inexperienced players can really knock the bidding out of whack, which can definitely impact the outcome of the game.  This is fine when learning the game, but can become frustrating when only one or two players are new and the rest have played before.

This is a relatively straight forward Knizia auction game. I don't find the decisions particularly interesting and am not a fan of Knizia's minimalist design philosophy. I also found the theme dissapointing as "Modern Art" suggests that one might actually learn a thing or two about either the art, the industry or both while the game offers none of the above.

RATING: 9
(NH)
Letter Grade: A-.  There isn't a more thorough auction game, or one that uses the actions of its players to develop as complex an in-game economy (except, perhaps, Medici)

Excellent fun.  It's easy to teach to new players, though they'll likely not see vistas of strategies open before them until after one or two seasons of scoring.  Plays quickly enough, as well, making it easy to fit into a night of gaming. 
UPDATE: Bumped this up to a 9 after repeated plays.  I've introduced this to non-gamers several times, and it's gone over quite well.  It's a bit hard to sell during the first round, as new players feel a bit anxious about how much to bid on a painting.  But after that it's smooth as silk, easy to introduce and teach.  And hey, I've even won a game of this one...

I love this game.  Pure auction fun with a bit of bluffing.  You definitely need to have a good sense of valuation and timing to do well at this game.  One of the guys I game with has this amazing knack of getting exactly the price he wants for the paintings he offers...usually more than they end up being worth.  He makes a killing off the seller strategy.

I've only gotten to play this game once, but I loved it.  The thing that makes auction games hard is that new players don't know the value of anything, so the auctions are all screwed up.  But with Modern Art, newbies can very quickly pick up on value and be competetive, with more efficient auctions.

Modern Art has a lot going for it. Like most Knizia games, it's extremely streamlined, pairing back all the fluff to focus on a sharp central mechanic.

The bidding is varied and in a single play I was amazed by the different strategies I could employ by offering different artists and different auction types at different times. The market manipulation causes some real stress as you worry about an opponent ending the round before you can position your works properly.

The game itself is super tight and it certainly helps that this new CMON edition of the game is drop-dead gorgeous. Oversize cards with varied, appealing artwork and an overall great aesthetic.

We'll see if this hits the table more often than Ra.

RATING: 7
Love the theme; the game itself is more average.  Some of the cards just seem much better than others (especially the double-auctions), and the game can be made a little too volatile through crazy bidding by other players, giving the game to an opponent.  Nevertheless, still fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the epitome of purely auction based games. The theme works surpisingly well, and the game plays fast with minimal downtime.

It's easy to make mistakes that benefit a particular player (which is bad), so the game plays best with players of mostly equal skill. It also surprisingly suffers from the alpha player syndrome, despite being competitive. It encourages any rude player to try and boss you as a mistake you might make, may benefit a third player.

There is one significant factor damping my desire to play this game:  the fact that there happens to be another auction game by the same designer that I just like better (Ra).  I really do like Modern Art for the same reasons that I like Knizia's other auction games:  it has lots of interesting twists and turns.  In this case it is the different auction types and the ability for the players to affect the value of the paintings by choosing which pieces to put up for auction.  So at the end of the day, I just don't see this getting a lot of play because I'll almost always suggest Ra instead.

Who says auction is a game mechanism.  Auction IS the game.  Speculation and manipulation is great.  I mean how many games have two "ation"'s.  Especially if you get good, then there is domination.  Its only flaw is new players can drastically effect the outcome of this game.  New players are  tougher to manipulate, and make crazy decisions that just make you shake your head.  That being said, new players tend to make similar mistakes, so it can be accounted for. I can't see this game ever getting old for me. 

 It will always be a solid standby. The more I play the more I enjoy it.  Scales well, plays quickly, no two games are the same, high amount of player interaction, very very few hands that are impossible to play and fun.  28 plays and I am still forced to think on my feet. 

 It scratches every gaming itch I have in blissful 45 minutes.  

The hand management is at the core of this game.  Setting up future plays with which artists to play, while setting up future plays by determining which artist to buy.  Sometimes not maximizing expectations in the short run, will maximize expectations in the long run.  The English variant included in the rules is the way I play after trying both out extensively.

I enjoy this game from time to time. The change in auction style is neat but ultimately the game feels a bit dull. Also seems like for a large part you can easily determine a painting's worth.

RATING: 4
SOLD (11/15/08) --- While this is a decent auction game, I personally enjoy Ra much more.  Perhaps there's something I'm missing but valuation in Modern Art seems much easier than in Ra, which makes the process of bidding less interesting and more of a foregone conclusion.  Everyone knows the maximum possible value of each painting sold, and as bidding tends to approach that value, it seems more and more pointless.

Awesome auction game that basically condenses all the main types of auctions: open, once around, sealed, fixed price and double auction.

The theme - sellers and buyers in the art world - make senses for the different auctions. I really enjoyed the changes of feel and choices.

Played with family once and it was received well. Not sure if enthusiasm would be maintained. I note that the most enthusiastic painting buyer placed dead last, probably due to overbidding.

There were no problems accepting the theme of the game.

...It seemed to me the game was won/lost based on accurate price valuations rather than on cleverly selecting which painting to auction.

This is an auction game with simple rules. However, the game play is very interesting. Players have to know when and what cards to play in order to maximise the money they earn. With good hand management, players may be able to profit well from selling their art. 

There are various "unspoken" alliances formed during the game. With more players owing a certain art, it will give incentive for the players to play that particular art to increase its value.

1st Edition German - One of my favorites, and part of R.Knizia's Bidding Trilogy, also including RA and Medici.  I have made 2 new card sets for this edition: Modern Art 1930 using art from five now famous modern artists whose lives intersected in the median of their collective ages in 1930 (Vaserely, Dali, Picasso, Matisse and Escher.) Modern Digital Art provides artworks from several contemporary digital artists I found searching online (Dan Kuzmenka, Kerry Mitchell, Jos Leys, Paul Decelle and Alice Kelley.) I would like to find out how (or if) I can distribute them due to copyright, etc.

Brazilian/Portuguese edition of the classic Reiner K. auction game Modern Art.  The artwork is okay, not really outstanding or better than the original.

A so-so auction game that hasn't held up well over time.  Go play Ra instead, it's much better.

Part of MA's problem is that with closed money, people can't keep track of who needs to be bid up; and with open money, the game devolves into too much calculation/AP.

The other, perhaps larger, problem is that being the player who happens to draw more double auctions seems a bit too powerful...

In a typical Knizia design, game play is relatively straight forward but player decisions have ripple effects that often cause unintended consequences which are relatively tough to gauge during game play. This is what makes Knizia games brilliant. Case in point, if you own certain art pieces with increasing value in your hand, having it in your own hand is useless. Yet auctioning these pieces away means you won't have them for final valuation unless you buy them yourself which is a double whammy since you won't gain money from selling them. Such is the angst of Modern Art. Lots of interlocking decision making which leads to some tough choices. It is not sufficient to focus on personal optimization but rather react to market forces. Great de

Finally got this to the table, it's so fantastic! 

It's peculiar that this game brings out the inner auctioneer/art critic in all of us considering it's just a bunch of auctions.

The Stamps version is still in shrink, the version I play with is the Wargames HK version. Both are beautiful. :meeple:

I bought this game at DragonCon 04.  I have had an interesting history with this game.  I first heard about it years ago, but frankly even after I got into boardgames and learned not to judge a game by its theme, the theme still managed to turn me off.  I bought the game at DragonCon 04, despite a complete lack of interest, and was even more bored by the contents.  Fortunately, I know this is an area where I cannot trust my instincts.  We tried it last weekend, and it showed great promise.  The art is just an excuse to hold auctions.  The lackluster contents are still a problem, but we're over the hurdle now, so that shouldn't matter much now.  I wish it came with more chips, because we were constantly providing change, but we were also over-bidding a lot, so it might not be as bad next time.

Awesome! My favorite aspect of this game is trying to figure out how to make suboptimal deals with all of your opponents in such a way that you make more money than any single one of them.  Playing like that also ensures that you're one of the most active traders at the table, which guarantees that you'll be actively involved the entire time.  Love it!

Truly outstanding.  This is the Daddy of all bidding games.  Probably my favourite game anywhere, ever, it's still Knizia's best and has lots of subtlety not all of which is immediately obvious.  It's best played with the incorrect rule for equals cards on their own (the next player takes his turn as normal and is not skipped) otherwise equals cards are much too powerful.

RATING: 6
A game where salesman skills, manipulation, lies and threats are the keys to victory. Very dependant on playgroup as one dumb play by a newbie or a kingmaker will wreck the game.
2x cards are a bit overpowered but have so far not broken our games. A skilled player manipulates the game to go in his preferred direction and those lucky bastards with 2x cards can be countered sometimes.
I've tried playing this without my "original gamegroup" but it sucks so badly I'd rather keep the good memories alive than ruin them further.
To sum it all up: This game lacks in so many parts that it can hardly be considered a good game by todays standards. Falling from a rating 9 to a rating 6.5 just because game groups change is something few games can achieve and point to crappy design choices and very poor balance. However the author of this game is known for just grinding out vast amounts of games without care to finish.

Probably the best auctioning game I've ever played.  Personally, I prefer this over Ra any day over the week.  I still love Ra, I just love this more.  The auctioning is fierce, and it seems everytime I figure out a brilliant new strategy I'm suddenly trounced by a newb.  That to me is the sign of a brilliant design, because the game somehow always seems to stay one step ahead of you, whether you've played it a 100 times or none.

So freaking tricky.  Short, but still very meaty.  It's usually easy to judge approximately how much a painting will be worth, but there's enough chaos that you don't know for sure.  The different types of auctions and the different payouts for cards as rounds progress means that there's always interesting replay in this one.  I really like how players, with the play of cards, have a limited control on how the market will develop, as well as just being simple buyers and sellers.  Better with fewer players, as the control over the market tightens.  Double auctions have the ability to decide the game, and if one person has significantly more than everybody else, it's their game to lose.

This game is a total bingo with me.  Stripped down mechanics in a seemingly simple auction game operate on a variety of levels that create a game experience of dazzling richness can complexity.

Would seem to be a good gateway auction game, will have to give that a try.

Auction games really are not meant for me, and since Modern Art is one of those, it won't get much points. I have played the game three times with different number of players. I would say, the more the better. At least with three players the game is quite boring and sooner or later this game will turn into a math test.

Updated after fifth play, changed the rating from 5 to 4. Basically you need try to get involved in every auction as long as you don't get to negative. That's because even if the seller makes 45K and you only 5K, but others would make 0K. Once the mechanics are clear, it is a math test. Boring.

We also played ' Modern Art', where each player is an auctioneer trying to entice the other auction houses to buy their trendy art whilst trying to predict the art that will generate the most money from sales. That word entice brings back memories of a 1970's 'Busstop expansion! There are a variety of auction actions available, and art is placed first, second and third based on numbers purchased, over four turns so it is the aggregate of these placings - 30 (first) down to 10 (third) - which governs how much could be made in sales that directly influences what bids might be made if the auctioneer is confident of making the proverbial 'killing' Probably best not played with people who are either card sharps and/or who have eidetic memories! An enjoyable game again.

THE game for people who like auction games, since there's a little bit of everything here.  There's a chance that the card draw can determine how well you'll do in the game, but I think it's more important to know how to valuate the paintings and buy and sell them for the right prices.  After my second game, though, I saw how an inexperienced player could throw the advantage to one player.

Really fun little auction game.  The variety of auction types makes it much more interesting and adds some strategic elements that wouldn't be there if only one type was used.

The "art" is horrendous, but that actually adds to the charm and makes it more thematically-accurate too because most [i]real[/i] modern art is equally horrendous.

Need to play this more.

A game with very clean math, yet not a dry game because cards are drawn.  One can play aggressive against the leader if the profits can go to a trailing player.

Modern Art is a great example of how a mechanic can also be a theme. Without feeling contrived auctioning is the mechanic and it's also the theme.

RATING: 7
Interesting auction game. It's hard to see where exactly you stand in relation to other players and takes a few games for first-time players to see where the paths to profit maximisation lies, but the uncertainty did not put me off. Components of the Mayfair version could be much better.

I really  enjoy this game a whole lot.  I am not necessarily good at market manipulation.   I am getting a little better about knowing what & how to bid.  But there is a ton of player interaction and the expressiveness of people as plans change and new things come up is just fantastic.  One of my very favorite games.

Good game to play with your smart friends. It is not like some other games that although the money is covered, player still got the sense who is winning, for this game, you have no idea who is the richest until the game is end, so unusally everybody plays his/her best through the entire game.

There are but a few simple components in this game but it packs a lot of decisions and strategy. Despite that, the rules are easy to understand and teach. Auctions can be a tense affair and depends on what other cards you hold and which artist's pieces won in the previous round(s). 

An extremely well-designed game. The quality of its game components are quite good too.

Rating based on Matagot edition.

RATING: 8
This is the epitome of auction gaming. I strongly dislike Ra, but find the decisions, interaction and pace of Modern Art to be breath taking. I am always willing to play this, something I can't necessarily say about other "favorites" of mine.[UPDATE 2/23/06] Dropped from 9.5 to 8.0 after two odd plays. While it's still a very good, and perhaps "pure" auction game, there are some odd situations where my only options were to force the end of a round to limit how much money people earned (while earning none myself) or generate nothing by offering a piece with no track record/value built in. Very frustrating to constantly have the players to my right offer up cards I want to auction and setting the threshold to four so my auctions would trigger the end and earn no cash.

Supremely simple yet rich in depth, Modern Art has a purity which I find very appealing. Unlike many games which force players to consider a number of possible moves, Modern Art focuses everyone&#039;s attention on one auction.  And since the paintings are of equal value to everyone, each player has a stake in every auction.

A solid game for lots of players.  I don&#039;t play it quite so often because I tend not to like it with less than four people.  Dry like most of Knizia&#039;s stuff, but I feel like this game can be far less dry when played with the right group.   Some house rules to put a little more effort into the presentation of a painting for auction help the game be more fun, or at the very least a &quot;no painting can be auctioned without first being titled&quot; rule.  ;-)

I really like the balancing act  in this game. Trying to make a certain artists more popular while getting good deals on your purchases and trying to run the right auction at the right time to score a decent payout is quite a lot of fun.  I can see where it could get too mathy with too much experience... but as a change up to the simpler Medici I think Modern Art has a nice place in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There is no doubt in my mind that Modern Art is probably one of the best auction games ever designed, and I do find the variety in the types of bidding available an interesting feature to mask the repetitiveness of the actual gameplay.  However, I just find no joy in something driven purely by this mechanic.  It just seem all too subjective, and also too dependent on what others may or may not do.  There does not appear to be any strategy in speculation, only luck.

After 1 Play: I'm a fan of auction games in general, but this one did nothing for me.  I don't know why but I just didn't enjoy my first game.  That said, I'm still willing to give it another chance based on its reputation and my preference for the genre.

RATING: 6
The gameplay is excellent. Modern Art's greatest weakness is, ironically, the art. This game is ugly. Even after playing, once I knew how fun it was, when I looked at the game I wasn't drawn to playing it again.

The system of auctioning paintings off to one another is fantastic. Trying to figure out which artists are going to be valuable each turn can be a bit of a brainburner at times, but successfully catching a painting for less than market value is awesome. Be warned, though: Modern Art can be very mathy, so if you don't like numbers running through your head the entire time you may not like this game.

Interesting tile-laying, area majority game. The game looks good but the many scoring options seem to bog things down a bit. Luckily the majority of the scoring takes place only at the end of the game.

RATING: 5
A solid design that sets up tensions between chain-building and area control, area control and improving your holding in a guild.  However, with choice of tiles to place and to draw limited to three, there don't seem that many interesting decisions turn to turn.  Solid, but unengaging.

Played once, didn't have the rules problems as taught by game publisher. A quick game that requires good deal of thought as their are 3 separate scoring methods that you need to watch to ensure you do not get caught out. I think more play will confirm this is a solid 7.

This feels like a solid seven to me. Tigris and Euphates Lite its not, but nontheless a fine way of spending an hour. Will put it into our lunchtime rotation and see how it sits in that slot.
- Update - still a solid 7 but rarely hits the table - somehow, for me, the fun factor is missing and at the end of the game I am left unsatisfied, win or not. YMMV

RATING: 6
Great game.  It's an area majority game where players try to get majorities in both towns and guilds.  Towns give scoring early.  Guilds give scoring late but give potentially lots more points.  Easy to teach and fairly quick to play.  Production quality could be better, but that's a very small nit.  Great, great game.

RATING: 6
A different take on tile placement/area control where you're not only trying to vie for majority in the districts of the board, but also the most prominent guilds in those districts as they are completed.  Overall, the game is pretty tense as players try to extend guilds they are strong in while smacking down the guilds they are weak in, leading to a lot of players dicking each other over.  Good game that I'd play if in the mood, but nothing I'd want to play all that often.

RATING: 6
I can't really think of anything being wrong with City & Guilds other than our rules explainer complaining that he had to reference both the English and German rules to fully understand matters and perhaps too great an emphasis on endgame scoring. It is a solid workmanlike design, though I felt somewhat haunted by that déjà-vu factor particularly in regards to Web of Power. 

Moreover, I didn't find gameplay overly exciting, but others may well differ and can understand why others might rate it as highly as 8. I myself, however, would  pick first a number of other titles on our shelf before choosing C&G. Therefore, I cannot really justify a better mark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very nice and surprisingly elegant.  Has a bit of the feel of Euphrat & Tigris, but without the combat.  Overly chaotic with five players.  Most strategic/least chacotic with three, but more competitive/contested with four.  While screwage is present it is relatively low, and the multi-layered scoring tends to mean that every time you take away VPs with one hand you're giving them some (less) back with the other.  Plays surprisingly quickly for a game of this weight (45 minutes, upper-middle weight).

RATING: 7
Solid tile layer from the folks at JKLM. First off, let me be clear, you will not mistake this for a HiG game, the components are obviously from a smaller company, and the price tag on this is higher than you might expect...but if you get beyond that, you will find a very enjoyable, fast playing tile laying game with a lot of interesting tactical play inside the box.

Each tile in this game offers a variety of options...it is lucrative to be in control of a block, but it is also valuable to support guilds and to create chains in the guilds in which you are most heavily invested. Each tile impacts multiple variables at once, so a single play can have large ramifications on the game state. There are also a number of things that one can do on each turn.

In spite of this, C&G is a very fast playing game for its depth. This is partially because of the restrictive hand of 3 tiles that you have to work with, and it is also because of the slightly restrictive tile laying scheme, which prunes the decision tree down a bit.

The key to winning this game seems to be cooperation, you want to work with the other players to build guild chains and to fill up blocks, but also leave yourself with enough space to finish off the blocks yourself (bonus tile placements in the early game) or to keep control of a guild or block when you absolutely need it.

I would say for the time investment of this game (1 hour first game, less than that subsequent) that it's a real all-star. Great game to play in-between other titles or to finish off the night with.

Two players fight for control of a section.  A third comes in and sways the fight arbitrarily one way or the other, because it gives the third player a few points.  One of the two fighting players, through no fault of their own is now screwed.  Dumb game.

RATING: 8
Excellent tile placement game.  Players play a tile onto one of 8 city blocks, each block consisting of about 10 lots.  Tiles are buildings in four guilds, players can either place "men" representing power in the city block on the tile, or take guild influence in the tile they've placed.  Guilds gain in power if they form up in chains within their block, or across streets into other blocks.  Blocks and guilds score when blocks are complete, and each guild will score for chain length at the end of the game.  I like this very much - turns are fast, but some nice things to consider.  You are limited by your hand of tiles to play from, which dents long term strategy.  Excellent game.

Since tile laying is a favorite mechanic for Shelley, this one's a great addition to the collection.  It takes a bit to get your head around one of the connection ideas in the game, but other than that rules are clear and it plays quickly, yet deeply.

The setting is a medieval city in which you build to gain influence over the various craftsmen's guilds.  The theme may have been done before but this is one of those fantastic strategy games in which there are more ways than one to score and every player is trying to make the best of all of them.

Choose to help the Bakers' Guild and somebody else just might decide they want to become most influential there; choose to extend your influence in the Candlemakers' Guild and watch as that guild's influence in the city peters out.

If Tigris and Euphrates hadn't been around first this would be king of the tile-laying strategy games.  I like it more than E&T; it could do with a real makeover though.

RATING: 7
This is a totally weird game. The play itself is very simple, with players placing a tile on the board from a hand of three, and possibly placing a pawn or two on it. But the tricky part is that these simple plays are affecting at least five separate game elements, and so the implications of any one move can get not-so-simple in a hurry. Each tile placement can impact: the overall worth of a city block, a player's standing within a city block, a player's standing within a guild, a guild's standing within a block, and a guild's standing as a part of a chain spanning several blocks. And I'm not referring to separate types of tiles. A single placement can impact every category. Essentially, there are five types of contests happening at once, all connected in some way. This makes the worth of any play deliciously hard to assess, and turns the game into something of a brainmasher.

The simplicity of the play, though, is a real boon. Players only have to consider one play at a time, not the whole shooting match. The bite-size decisions seem to stave off analysis paralysis and keep the pace from lagging. I'm especially fond of games with simple rules and complex, multifaceted decisions, and City & Guilds is exactly that kind of game.

Contestant for the worst rules ever, really (and I've used version 3 already)!

Away from that and the prototype looks of this game (I find the art kind of refreshing, though), it's a decent tile laying game with some meat, as there are 2 layers of majorities with different options to choose from.

It didn't offer anything new when it came out, but it's light ruleswise and still offers much more depths than Carcassonne ever did.

RATING: 7.5
Played once with three players.  There is some positional play in trying to block the expansion of guild colors you won't have majority in, as well as trying to set your self up for majority in an area.  If you can do both at once even better.  

Has good turn angst, as very often you want to do many things at one time.  I like the different powers of the pieces as well. 

Guild colors should have been different than player color.

Seems like a very sold 7 or 8 with three players, and plays very fast for a middle-weight game.  Would probably drop to a 6-7 with 4 and I would imagine that it would be pretty poor with 5.

This is a good area control and tile laying game. I like the multiple scoring tracks. Caveat: I have only played this once and do not know anyone with a copy. If I could confirm my impressions with another couple of plays I would buy a copy and raise my rating. * Update: this game is relatively unknown and highly underrated in my opinion, mainly due to uninspired art I suspect. I have now purchased this and played it many more times. It is excellent: fast and strategic with a good dose of luck. It is difficult to be sure who is ahead or behind because so many points are calculated late in the game. It has a great mix of strategy and tile luck to keep it interesting to play with people of different skill levels and experience. Managing control of guilds and blocks while improving the guilds you are strong in is brilliant. Bravo!!

RATING: 7.5
Have only played this with 3 and it was very good. Fun balance between building guild levels and building neighborhood presence. Tile selection can get stale at certain points so it is always good to keep a good balance of tiles if possible. Guild adjacency is a very important aspect to not lose track of as it could result in a lot of points at the end. Consistent 2nd place majority can be a winning strategy if used correctly.

RATING: 6
Seems interesting in my one play of it with four plyrs.  I thought it had several mechanics from other popular German games but the synergy of them didn't really wow me - maybe I'm just missing something more to the game.  One plyr compared it with Web of Power, which I thought was a somewhat "fair" assessment.  I'm not sure if there's much long-term control or whether you just have to be flexible & opportunistic as to what face-up tiles (buildings or markets) are available when it's your turn.  On a minor note, I didn't like the color contrast, or lack of contrast between player and guilds - they should've been different or should've been the same tokens matching the symbols on the tiles.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quick playing game which forces some hard decisions in a small decision tree.  On your turn, you can play a market tile (which jumps your influence in a guild by 2 points), a ministrel tile (on which you place one of your men), OR you place a workshop (which allows you to place either two men or a man and push up your influence in the related guild by one point).  Scoring occurs whenever a city block is full and focuses on who has majority influence in the block and then a secondary scoring is done for whoever has majority influence in the guild that is most dominant in that block.  After all 8 city blocks are filled, a final scoring takes place in which you score for each guild their longest chain according to how many city blocks that chain encompasses.

Outstanding Game which is a Joy to play. The time goes quickly - next thing you know the game is over. Carcassone/Keythedral-esque. Has never failed to please. Works well with any number; 3 is probably the most intense. Working on a 2 player variant, ala China/Mykerinos, stay tuned (completed).

Could use better production values. Z-Man games should produce this one in a better edition.

One problem with the game is that the same colors are used in too many places to represent different things: is that red a player VP counter, or is it a Guild Color, or...

The only mechanical problem I have with the game is that at some point too many of the 3 face up tiles will become stale. For example, let's say Christine is 7 spaces ahead of everyone else in her Yellow Guild investment; she has no incentive to take any Yellow Markets from the pool and likely neither does anyone else. But there they remain, turn after turn. Happens in most sessions and is annoying as heck. We need a mechanism to refresh the pool when tiles there become too stale, especially Market tiles.

This has a chance to go up as I try the game with less than the maximum 5 players. I'm also docking it a point for a HORRIBLY written rulebook - you'd think that a game from a British company wouldn't read as if English was their 3rd or 4th language! ***Update*** Kudos to the designer for quickly getting a corrected rule book online here at BGG. Upon further plays, this has become one of my new favorites, at least for the time being. Will it have stayng power? I don't know, but even if it doesn't I feel I've gotten my money's worth already - nice job, JKLM!

RATING: 7.5
I'm a fan of games that offer you a number of different little decisions that all add up to your larger goals.  This game constantly gives you choices of between you need to do get ahead and what you should be doing to take advantage of other players scoring.  It's never good to be left out of anything here, but as ties favor the leaders you need to set out on your own to get ahead.  Lovely.

This is a solid three player game, with more plays I could see this rating going up. I'd imagine with four there would be more competition, but the chaos may be too much.  I would never play this five.  The fact that you are constantly vying for position in so many different fields matched with the fact that the margin drops dramatically between the first and second position, means that timing is much of this game.  With more players there is little way to control the timing and I feel that your game would be more dependent on the tile draws.  While you are still constrained by the tiles that are available, I think the system works as it has a stock system that rewards players jumping into gluts, while players on the outs do well to invest in futures.  With three you can plan your moves against your hand and the draw, with more, I'm not sure if I would be capable to work with it.

This took a long time to find and then even longer to hit the table.  After all that work just to play the damn thing, I think it is absolutely worth it.  Still, it ain't glamorous, but it is charming.

cool game.  I noticed early on, the long game has the better payout in points than the short game.  The choice of colors and art are unfortunate in the design and manufacture, as you have to be careful in saying things like "yellow controls the block."  Is that the yellow player, or the yellow guild?  Still, a good looking game.

Updated after 5 plays.

This may well be a 10.  This plays brilliantly with 3 or 4, with the component quality being the only caveat.  This is not a concern for me, and never plays a roll in my ratings since I don't particularly care whether a game looks like an FFG release or homebrew...the play's the thing, and this game has it in spades.

The play is simple enough that you can play it with relatively new gamers--meaning it's not a gateway game, but could be a "next step."  Conceptwise the game is picked up very quickly--but watch that new players understand that the player colors and the guild colors, while identical, are not related.  It would have been better had the game been released with distinctly different player colors.

The tension of the game builds during play, culminating around the final two or three turns as everyone tries to bring their pans together.

Some concern has been mentioned about locking up the tile choice...never seen it, don't understand how that could happen.  It is certainly a group-think problem, as this game not only benefits play to improve your position, but it also benefits play to slow or block your opponents' positions.  This is because you can almost always make use of any tiles to improve your own position, typically playing to block or slow another player will improve your position slightly less but since the game is zero-sum, slowing an opponent and improving your position slightly can often improve your position more, relatively, than simply always playing to maximize your position.

This is a delightful game with 3--less chaotic than with 4, with perhaps just a tiny touch of end-game AP possible, but the superb delicate balance between the 3 players makes it akin to juggling knives.

With 4 it has proven to be a little more social, though it's not bad with 3 in that respect, but you do lose a little control since it's more possible that the tiles you want from the display will be gone by the time it gets to you.  So it has a more tactical feel and the long-term strategies have to be modified more on the fly.

Haven't played with five, but based on the four player game, I personally probably wouldn't like it near as much.  To note, I generally like games with fewer players because it rewards gamers who can look/plan further down-stream.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting tile-laying game with rather multi-facted decisions: tiles aid in area majority (block scoring), guild majority (majority guild scores per block) and long guild chains (end-game chain scoring).

It plays quickly (it says 90 minutes on the box but it should be more like 45) and there is a lot to consider. Downsides are that the explanation can be somewhat painful (multiple types of majorities with several tiebreakers), it perhaps strikes a poor balance between opacity and randomness, and the components are rather unattractive.

A very abstract tile-laying game that to me, playing for the first time in 2014, felt a little dated. It's kinda clever, and fans of abstract titles will probably love its simplicity, but for me there just wasn't enough going on to really hold my interest. But take my rating with a grain of salt, as I'm not a huge fan of tile-laying or abstract games to begin with. If this were a worker-placement or auction game, I might be praising City and Guilds' elegant simplicity rather than bemoaning its lack of depth. For me, though, it's a 6 at best.

Played once (with 4 players). An interesting tile-laying game with clever ideas. There is some randomness in the draw of the tiles and some mechanisms might be uselessly complex, but overall the game is enjoyable, with many things to consider when playing a tile. It is probably shorter than announced (60 minutes, and I guess it could be down to 45 minutes with experienced players). The production is decent - it is a pity that the game is a bit expensive. Also, the guilds' colours match the players' colours, which does not help understanding and readability.

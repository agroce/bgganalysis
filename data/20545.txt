This rating must be explained: I do not give 9 to the "game" itself, which is or is not a real game.

I give 9 to the Story Cubes because the idea is bloody brilliant! This accessory or activity (call it what you will) is pure genius, allowing people like me (writers and game masters) to come up with quick ideas. I can't wait to try this as a social game/activity, too.

Es uno de esos juegos sencillos, sólo tienes que echar los dados y complejos, porque tienes que inventarte una historia para encajar en sus dibujos, de esta forma puedes desatar tu imaginación y creativida, incluso entrelazar historias con los demás jugados, las variantes son infinitas y muy divertida. Jugado con niños pueden salir cosas increíbles y con adultos cosas más divertidas.

My rating for this game is based on my experience with my 3 year old daughter.  This game has basically taught her how to tell stories.  She is absolutely in love with it, and has never been so excited for anything as this game.  I have a blast playing it with her and the family.  It gets a 10, not because I always want to play it or because everyone will love it, but because it does exactly what it sets out to do, and does it very well.

This was great fun, and something that I can play with my girls (7 & 5) every night as part of their bedtime routine.  They loved playing it, and it was fun to watch their imaginations go to work.  We played as follows:  We rolled all the dice, and then each one of us in turn made up a complete story using all 9 pictures.  Each story was different and they were all fun and silly.  I have several other ways to play in mind to try during future plays.  My girls want to play this again and again; they really seem to love it.  I think this is a game that we will enjoy for several years, even if we play it nightly.  I'm already considering purchasing Rory's Action Dice and eventually Voyages.  Great game.

Rory’s Story Cubes make for a simple and compact game that possibly isn’t a game either: they’re more of an intellect sharpener and creative tool than anything else and as such they need be rated high; on the other hand, they would fall pretty mediocre if rated as a game.

I consider myself a decent storyteller, so I enjoy the moderate challenge these dice stand for: however, the base game gets repetitive quickly unless you combine randomly-picked Cubes from the expansions as well to spice up your tales.

I can see why this could be a hit with creative people who have an imaginative mind. I don’t exactly fit that description, but I’m not totally without imagination either – and this is a game which is far away from my alley... This should obviously just be played for fun and for story-telling, and I think younger kids would enjoy it quite a bit. For me, however, it’s a huge miss, and I wouldn’t recommend playing this with more than 0 players...

OK, this isn't really so much a game as an activity, but my kids love it.  We used it tonight as an exercise to have my son review his vocabulary words -- I gave him a topic to build his story around, then he rolled the dice and had to tell us a story incorporating all his vocabulary words.  It gave me a chance to help him understand how to use his words in context and how to form sentences while he came up with a crazy story about a guy who parachuted into Alaska and encountered a crazy old man in a cabin.  By the end, we were all embellishing the story and the kids were rolling on the ground laughing - it was great fun!  We ran through it a second time with a new roll of the dice and since he had the hang of it by then, the story was even funnier.  Then his sister had to get into the act ... it was all I could do to get them to bed tonight. :) 
Not something I'd be inclined to pull out too often on game night, but great fun when you just want to relax and get creative.  A great tool to use with kids.  Also available on iTunes.

I like this game. It obviously has to fit into a good game group but if you have been having a few drinks, this one is fun. If I have 6-9 players, I'll give everyone a die and we take turns throwing them and adding to the story. What's nice is that people don't have to get off the couch if you've got a casual group around, just pass a box for them to throw into. At the end of the story, you shout drink! and everyone takes another gulp. If you like Adventure Time, check my variant.

Not actually a game, but a great activity - with the right people... Some people will straight out refuse to play this. Then there are those that just can't come up with a story worth telling if you put a gun to their head (which might make an interesting expansion). Especially in the beginning, there's a tendency to use up the nine dice in nine sentences. But that's not how the Cubes work. A story is more than just a sequence of random occurences. And a fun story is way more than that.

I think the most fun way to play this is to have someone tell a story why people keep asking him about it. If she mentions a Mr. Smith, ask for his first name and age. The story must be a combined effort for the game to be fun. Otherwise it might end up being a bunch of people sitting together and babbling nonsense.

This is an activity, not a game.  There's nothing wrong with that, but in the group I was playing in, we needed a little more structure to propel the stories along.  I suspect that would tend to be the situation with most groups I play with.  Other groups, with people who are more self-directed about telling stories, potentially including groups with children, might make better use of the game.

I can barely think of a lighter game that this. A lovely package and great looking dice. There is absolutely no game game here.

A very popular kids game from Gamewright. Got it for our 10 year old who likes to tell & write stories. I get the educational/creative value of this dice game, but I don't see all the hoopla & various expansions. Its really more of an activity than a game. I guess it may be popular because parents nowadays believe that they are required to & judged on getting their kids "fun" that "educates". But frankly, its still as boring as when our parents attempted it on us when we were kids.

Nine dice have unique pictures on every side.  The dice are rolled and then a story is created based on the pictures.  There are a number of variations for different approaches to the story telling.  

I had purchased this thinking it would be appropriate for very young children. Most of the pictures are basic (tree, hand, fire) but one picture is of an abacus and another balance scales.  Three pictures are very similar: a lock, another side on another die depicts a key, and a third die has a keyhole.  Out of the thousands of pictures that could be chosen I am disappointed that three of them would be so specific and related.  This reduces the story telling range instead of expanding it.

This is a good idea to help develop a child's imagination and story telling abilities.  And we can use blank dice and put on other pictures.

This doesn't interest me as an adult game although it could be.  (Once upon a Time..., is a similar and better game for adults.)

Juego, juego, para mí no es. Más bien es un mecánica genialmente implantada que permite a los padres inventarse el cuento que contarle a los peques y que estos puedan también contarlo, sin que sea el repetitivo cuento de marras que ya se conocen a la saciedad y del que tú, como padre, también estas aburrido.

A great bedtime game to play with children before reading a story and lights out. My daughter (5) enjoys hearing and telling a story from the cubes. As a children's activity I rate this a 9 - always willing to play.

RATING: 6.5
for the kiddos

I think you really want some expansions for this but it is a fun little diversion, and I think it will be great for kids.  Apparently some writers etc get a lot out of it in terms of sparking creativity and breaking through blocks.  The base game will give you a good idea if you're interested, but if you enjoy it I really recommend some expansions.

iOS: available and seems pretty well done.  Many expansions are available as well but I had trouble with the IAP so can't recommend them.  The base game will at the very least tell you if you like the game and you could still get some play out of it.

RATING: 7
For most of us, the imagination is fired when limitations are imposed, and you'll find that here: the dice in this game provide elements that you must include in an ad-libbed story. A good one for families to play together; you can use fewer dice when younger children are playing, and you can easily vary it, such as working together on the same story. Sure, you could make your own similar game with chits of paper, but the dice are great quality, and add to the experience.

Note: can also be used as a sort of family-oriented, cut-price Oblique Strategies in creative projects, or at least ones with elements of narrative.

This is a personal favorite to play with the kids. It allows them to be creative, identify symbols, create their own stories with those symbols, and communicate.

One of my friends who teaches ESL plans to use this game in her lessons. I plan on getting a couple more sets of dice to give as Teacher gifts, perfect for special education. 

This would be a great game to use to encourage speech and communication.

Such a simple idea behind this game, but it's beautiful and very enjoyable to play. 

My daughter fell in love with it instantly when I rolled the dices for the first time and began to tell the story. I like to take a quick 10 to 15 minutes session before her bedtime reading.

I've only got the base version yet, but I will be adding other ones to the collection soon.

The basic premise here is to roll the dice and using the pictures on what is rolled, tell a story. You can make it a progressive story by having each person roll a die and add their bit among other variations. This is a great activity to do with kids or for any variety of travel or developmental opportunities or just if you like making up stories and want to roll up a few ideas.There are times and places for Rory's Story Cubes, but when you want to play an actual game isn't one of them. This is kind of where the BGG scoring system is a problem for me. I'm perfectly willing to give a low rating for an activity purporting to be a game. However, I don't think Rory's Story Cubes are necessarily selling themselves as a game than as a creative activity. As such, I've made the decision for great activities like this to simply not rate them. I don't want to give a great activity a low score, but neither do I want to rate it well as something it isn't.

I haven't played a game using these; I bought them as a tool for generating NPCs on the fly in tabletop RPGs, and accordingly I'm rating them "unplayed." They work very nicely as NPC generators.

They're nicely made, chunky and oversized, and the etching is solid. The case is a great size, and if you keep the insert (as the manufacturer suggests) it stays quiet, portable, and should even work in the car. Combine all that with a nice price and this is a clever thing indeed.

I'm told this is a kids game, but honestly i have just as much fun with it. There are many good variants to play. Our favorite is to take turns telling a story together by rolling one die at a time. The base set seems a little childish though, i prefer the Voyages set, whose theme really lends itself to telling an epic adventure.

I'm not sure about adults, but with children at hand the Story Cube series is a must have. There are many story-telling game out there, but these few dice give the exact minimum of guidelines to inspire, but allow the story to unfold freely. Even if my kids are tired, or moody and don't want to play any games, they never refuse Rory's Story Cubes.

Since there's no scoring, it's not really a game, but we don't care about win conditions in Once Upon a Time, so it's just as much of a game to us.  My daughter is a huge Once Upon a Time fan so I picked this up to try.  Not surprisingly, she loves it.  It's a lot of fun for us in our family.  The weirder the story, the better.

"Marky tell another!" 
didnt get to try the draw your story or every one make a story from the same cubes.. any way very cool i want my own set,
we did every one have 1 dice and add to story on yro turn.. and just some one make a story with 9 dice and 2 player story back and forth with 4 dice each.,

Voyages
fairy tales
clues 
so far.

Rather mislabeled as a game, it is actually more of an activity.  We play using a variety of methods and the stories do come out rather easily and often are quite enjoyable.  However, with only six sides the dice are somewhat limiting.  Still, a fun activity to do with my wife and son and visiting friends with a spark of storytelling.

I tried this once with a fairly imaginative group, but it didn't have much legs. If you're really into it, I could see this being enjoyable (it definitely would be fun for kids--at least for a little while), but it only lasts as long as your imagination. On game night, who wants to sit around for hours and tell random stories? Though, strangely enough, I still keep it around.

I know these are meant to be a game.  I can't rate them very highly for that purpose.  But as a series of story starters, I'd give them a 10.  I don't know if they have plans to make physical copies, but the iOS app has some pretty cool sets coming soon (as of April 2013) as IAP.

This is fun.
I love putting together quick stories by myself & my 5yo son has surprised me with his creativity.
It's quick & colaborative.

Update - 26/02/2011
I think that what I'm personally finding here is that I was terrible at English when I was at school & my stories lacked any form of imagination. I find that these dice push me to be more creative. Would have been great to have these way back then.
I play with these more than the plays counter would suggest. I get these out quite regularly, usually late at night & forget to register my plays on the following day.

"Not really a game, but can be a fun creative activity."

What I like:
- Great components
- Clever idea

What I don't like:
- Some of the faces seem hard to use

Especially for kids, this can be a simple story-telling exercise. But it's not really a game, since it doesn't have scoring per se. It's probably more fun with some of the additional dice sets like actions.

Obligatory "more of an activity than a game" disclaimer, I guess. Although these dice certainly allow for play, creativity, experimentation, spontaneity, personal challenge, and operating within constraints. I personally think those skills are far more valuable in life than whether or not you can turn wheat into clay, but that may be just me. 

I've used this set (and others) with my son mainly as bedtime story generators. We mix and match sets, we tell a story on our own, we alternate every-other-die, and we have even had stories where the dice get to interact with one another by moving them around the play surface.

Calling this a game is a stretch.  It's an amusement to be played with kids.  Taken in that context, it's a great product.  My kids loved it and immediately took to playing.

The usage is very simple.  Roll the dice and arrange them to tell a story.  Although simple in concept, we found them remarkably entertaining.

If buying as a game, you will be disappointed.  If buying as a child development tool, you will be very happy.  Nice dice.

not really a game, but great custom dice!

the official story telling game does work well as other such games I've played.  It's very hard to make any kind of coherent story about a small set of arbitrary stuff without either huge elaboration (which feels like cheating since you are largely ignoring the icons) or a bunch of non-sequiters.  So, the dice don't actually drive the story telling, they just interfere with it.  Adults are bored, and kids just stall.

Once Upon a Time Dice. Not strictly a game as there's no scoring and no winner(s), but it's great fun nevertheless. Needs sorely a proper rules set for the competitive boardgamer to fully enjoy.

RATING: 8
Fun game. More of a group activity game, in the same universe as pictionary. Requires some creativity since there are no set rules. We like to play like this: Each player takes a turn picking a die and telling a part of the story. With the right group this can be a hilarious game.

Played a couple of times with my wife and my parents. More of a social experiment than a game per se. Great for stimulating creativity. Very relaxing, excellent to learn or teach a foreign language due to its lack of language-dependency. Great for all ages due to the complete lack of rules and competitiveness and short "playing" time. Lots of potential.

This and its expansions are limited only to your imagination. There are some restrictions (for example, it is impossible to get certain combinations of icons on one throw due to each face being totally unique) but a great game nontheless and can be used for a quick filler game, education or even plot out an entire novel!

Cool stuff to play with kids, learn languages, train imagination, play without any special goals. It's not really a board game. It's fun multi use toy / tool hence so high rating.

This does not feel like a real game.  Every time it comes out, we just mess a round for a bit and then put it back on the shelf for a year or two.  Not sure why I haven't freed up that space on my shelf.

Kilenc egyedi d6 kocka, különböző ábrákkal. Eldobod, majd minden eredményt egy történetre húzol fel. Legyen mókás, hihető, élményszerű. Nincs pontozás, nincs győztes, a lényeg a szórakozás. Idegen nyelv tanulásához is jó segítség lehet!
Lézetik általános, utazásos, illetve akciódús változat, ezek persze kombinálhatóak is.

I can be convinced to play this filler provided there are plenty of weeks between each session. I wish there were more dice included in each pack to make this a bit more replayable.

*Owned for school - single copy* We played this one as a class to introduce it, and I think the kids enjoyed it quite a bit.  Some of them acted a bit goofy with it by just throwing all of the words together into a story that didn't really make sense, but it was neat to see what others did when they really looked for that thread to tie everything together and came up with a cohesive idea.

I dont' thing it's "enormous fun" but it's ok with kids and useful as a tool to achieve different tasks, such as inviting people to talk, for instance in a language course.
The problem is, it is probably too repetitive. After all, once in 6 times you use it, you have to talk about a turtle (and so on with all the other faces)

Well, technically it's not a game. But the idea is pretty interesting - however it can be hard to encourage people to "play". I myself love it, if only for the idea itself - but I can understand those who may not want to play at all.
There are many storytelling games, but having rules usually doesn't convince people to take part in the experience, if they're not "storytelling type". Story Cubes have essentially no rules at all. It's the simplest approach, and in the right group, they can be real fun.

Like Dixit, I think this game requires certain personalities to be fun/entertaining.  My stories tend to be very literal interpretations of the dice.

A nice new style of CCG, that is more dependent on resource management than speed-destroying the opponent. The game involves ship and base building, economics and ship battles. Perfect.Well worth a try-out if you enjoy CCG's or are a fan of the online computer game.

RATING: 9
An excellent card game for people who love starships (especially BIG starships) and turning starship into slag. Offers a number of intriguing possibilities (if you invest into it enough to obtain a larger card pool than the starter decks provide, that is -- but then again, the game was not too overpriced) and has rewarded me with hours and hours of fun and joy. The cards look beautiful, the game mechanics are complex yet not dense. I have played EVE for longer than a year and still love the game. My only regret  is that no further expansions were published.

Looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.   

Only interested in cards from the following sets:  all

Can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards).  

Not really interested in this one until the starter & booster boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins and I can obtain in bulk.  
Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).  

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 1:3 (1 of my MtG cards for 3 of your Eve cards).

This is a great ccg. If you love sci-fi or just a good ccg then i strongly recommend this game.The only down side is finding players. Plus its a whole lot better than World of Warcraft ccg.

RATING: 8
Rating based on my first game using two of the demo decks available at the game's website. Liked it a lot and soon thereafter purchased _both_ starter decks (though I still haven't played with them due to lack of time) :)

A game that is very easy to learn and get into, plus the artwork is awesome! Gameplay wise, I really enjoyed the rules for "build time" so that the bigger, more powerful ships doesn't just pop out into play. Enjoyed my first game of EVE more than WoW.

RATING: 6
Likes: The ships and cards have built in timers by rotating the cards to show a turn has been spent building/using them.

Dislikes: Most cards only work for one or two of the four factions and you can only have one faction in your deck, so it would be very hard to play draft format.

A functional CCG is becoming a rare thing these days, but this one flies. It is interesting, has some good customizing, and lots of meaningful decisions.

EVE is very much based on ships slugging it out: it doesn't yet seem to have big concepts or fresh ideas in the base set. Hopefully future expansions will bring out more aspects, more modifier cards, and some big-picture stuff to advance the game beyond zapping each other.  
 
If you ask me it is a real achievement to craft a fun, balanced CCG without noticeable flaws. Compare to recent releases like Conan [broken], City of Heroes [dry], Gallactica [broken], or the Universal Fighting System [tedious] and this is best CCG in a long long time. Worth buying the starters to see for yourself! Rating may rise depending on quality of expansions.

My wife and I enjoy this game, and have to get it to the table more often. It plays pretty quickly if you don't play too defensively. A balanced strategy is required, and it must be executed swiftly. If you focus on laborious defense, and take no risks, then the game will bog down. One player simply HAS to take the fight to the other. If nothing else, you have to pick away at his outlaying areas to deprive him of resources. That's the way it is. This is meant to played as a fairly fast game. As opportunities to smash your opponent come up, you must seize them immediately. 

An enjoyable game, with a decent theme, that can end VERY abruptly if you don't watch your galaxy closely. This isn't intended to be a long drawn out sparring match, it's intended to be a knife fight that's over quickly and messily. 

This is both the game's greatest strength, and its greatest weakness. If you know this going in, the game can be quite enjoyable. I recommend it.

Sounds good on paper, but I didn't care a whole lot for it. It's hard to pinpoint all the reasons, but I think how home base attacks work has a lot to do with it. It seems like there is minimal action until you build up enough units for a game-ending assault.

Also, it plays slowly (most of the game is about building up for that one big assault), and the components could use some work too (those ISK coins are lame).

RATING: 6
The game had beautiful art of the ships and space regions, and had some interesting mechanics, but in the end it seemed that the player with the biggest ships out first would claim victory. This comment is based on a single play and my judgement of the gameplay may change in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As CCGs go, this one was disappointing. The game seemed to end quite abruptly, and left both players feeling somewhat unsatisfied. Certainly there are better options - if you are a fan of EVE Online, at least the terminology in the game and the ship types might make sense, but to someone who doesn't play the online computer game, this was just a poor sci-fi version of so many other CCGs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Only one play using the AMARR and MINMATAR starter decks.  Found it rather unbalanced in favor of te Minmatar, as my ships were fairly quickly disposed of by my opponent, as all I seem to have were mining ships...  Of course this requires more plays, but we will most probably be using the other starters to see if it is more balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like the Eve online game, but with this you do your PVPing face to face and it doesn't require months of play to get your battleships. If you want to unplug and have fun this one is worth a try. I actually like it better than Magic TG, but that may be because of my love of the computer game this is based off of.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game, it has a nice flow to it and enough variety to challenge even with only the base set out.  There are several alternate victory conditions, I expect them to become more viable as new sets come out but some of them are already quite doable - it's just that in the process of working on some of them you end up winning anyway by the traditional condition.

While I loves me a good CCG, I burned out on the whole collectible thing somewhere in the mid-'90s.  Eve SG gets super-lucky bonus points for coming out with not just pre-constructed decks, but two pre-constructed decks in one box for instant head-to-head play.  I just wish more CCG and CMG companies would do the same.  But they won't, as it's much easier to sell a lottery ticket than a stock certificate...

This is the only CCG I've ever collected. Apart from the obvious fact that, now being defunct, it was a bad one to choose, it makes me wonder if there's really much to the whole genre. The idea of deck building fascinates me - it's probably the same part of my brain that enjoyed making Warhammer army lists when I was younger - but the reality usually boils down to picking 4x13 cards if you're trying to be competitive. The design decision that I find strangest is only drawing one card a turn: it seems to be a recipe for dull gameplay.

Focusing more specifically on Eve, the outer regions mechanic is a nice one. When it works, it generates a real back-and-forth flow to the game, but sadly the fact that you can just warp straight to an opposing starbase and shoot it up means they're ignored in 75% of games.

The game has some interesting elements. BuuuUUUTT, I would prefer this game as a board game rather than a CCG. As a board game, which could look like a simplified twilight imperium, it would have been perfect. The game is also unbalanced. In a multi-player game, if you pull out the "moon harvester" at the beginning of the game, you can win the game before the 5th turn. That's how I won the first game I have ever played. Can I say !Broken card!.

As a board game, it would have prevented the situation where I make a big ship sooner than the others then I attack directly their stations and kill the player. The reason why is because there wouold be some distance to cross before you could reach your opponenent's station.

Picked up a starter pack at Goodwill, and I have to say, I'm really impressed by this CCG! I have no idea what the theme is, but evidently it has to do with warring factions in space. The game is pretty simple. You build up ships, improve locations, and claim different areas that pop up as the game goes along. Your ultimate goal is to capture your opponent's home world. I found the mechanisms of this game to be pretty fresh and interesting for a CCG, despite having some obvious influences from Magic: The Gathering. Nowadays they're bringing back a lot of old CCGs, and I think EVE is one that deserves a second look. While the mechanisms are very simple, the gameplay is really engaging and enjoyable. It just needs a more streamlined way to deal with keeping track of money and resources. This is possibly the best CCG I've played apart from M:tG.

Not really interested in this one until the boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk.  Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).  Looking to pay about "nn" cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer "nn" cents per/ in trade value if trading].  


nn = 31.  Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 3:1 (3 EVE for 1 MtG).

A now-defunct CCG which offers some deviations from the conventional format. There are some nice features, including territory which can be fought over and conquered (then won back) and a sort of 'production queue' so you can see which units your opponents have coming out in the next couple of turns. 

Runs a bit long with 3 or 4 players, but not too badly. Worth a play if you can pick up cheap-ish - and vastly superior to Magic: The Gathering. Despite being a CCG, no card collection is required! The starter sets have everything you need.

(provisional) Nicely structured but nothing desperately original.  That's not a bad thing, and everything is implemented well.  There seem to be a decent variety of deck types in the base game to keep it interesting, but it's not at all clear whether the "biggest always wins" philosophy will turn out to be too strong.  A couple of the innovative features (the rotating cards to indicate duration, and the income generation) may well catch on elsewhere.

RATING: 5
An Icelandic CCG (Didn't see that one coming, did you?) based on the MMO of the same name. The cards are gorgeous, although the black backing shows wear pretty quickly.

There are a ton of creative new ideas in EVE. The command system allows many of the ships to assume different roles, depending on their tactical situation. My favorite innovation is the event cards that have a count down timer and unleash a different game altering effect every turn until they expire. Another nice touch is allowing resources to carry over from turn to turn, allowing players to save up for really huge units. Overall, it is a pretty slick system.

 On the negative side, there are some hugely dominant strategies that take away from the whole affair. Swarm decks are nearly unstoppable. Big units and specialty units (mining ships) aren't worth building as a weenie swarm will bury them every time. Out of a pretty substantial collection of cards (two booster boxes and 4 starters) my friends and I could not solve this problem. The swarm decks will win, period. So for the most part, all these awesome mechanisms get flushed right down the toilet. There was a recent expansion which may have addressed this issue, but none of us were willing to pony up any more money for it, after being let down the first time through.

RATING: 6.3
this is not my kind of game. I have it because it was given to me for free and I tried it.
It's not that bad. At first, rules seem a bit complicated for me but after a few turns it's all quite simple. My first and only game was sadly interrupted before my first attack to the enemy starbase but, all in all, it wasn't a bad experience.
It just seems a bit too mechanic and you repeatedly have to count your coin production and then keeping in mind all the ongoing effects. It is not fluid at all, it is not "simple" on the mind but rather complicated without adding much complexity or tough decisions.
Dunno if I'll play it ever again.
Wonderful graphic in most of the cards.

There were lots of great mechanics in this game.  I liked that you could set your ships to different actions.  Unfortunately, balance was a huge problem in the first set with wienie rush being far too powerful.  Any use of the more unique mechanics meant that you weren't pumping out guys and so were going to lose.  The second set may have fixed this problem, but I don't know as I didn't buy any.

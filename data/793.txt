This was way more fun than I ever thought it would be.  As far as press your luck games go, this is now at the top of my last beating out Can't Stop.  Really, if you like press your luck games, this is a must have.

Betting on Yahtzee is an interesting idea.  It's more fun than it sounds, but the player elimination angle makes it lose a point for me.

I owned it and traded it.  It seemed like a decent dice game with good production, but ultimately it wasn't compelling enough to keep.  If you need a dice game that is different from yachtzee but requires a similar amount of attention, I can recommend this one

Box shows obvious shelf wear with one split corner that follows along the edge of the lid for another inch.  Another one inch tear, wrinkling, and dishing complete the box. :)  The rule set is downloaded from the Hasbro website...the Yahtzee Deluxe Poker rules...but is the same game.  All five dice, 36 cards, rolling tray, six tokens and chips are present.  According to the box, there should be 128 chips, but I count out 130 chips...Bonus!  Fun party game.

RATING: 5
A Yahtzee-type game where you have a goal for each die roll. This is better as it has bidding and betting. Still, it doesn't grab me as much as Farkel or To Court the King. I might even prefer to play basic Yahtzee. 

Update: Traded

$.99 Goodwill find.  Risk management and knowing the odds make for some decisions on how much and when to bet.  Kids like it even if they don't understand the odds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad variation on other Yahtzee style games.  The strategy of the auctions is quite interesting, especially since you can still win money without rolling.  It can be a little frustrating if people continuously fail to roll the required numbers, but that's just part of the game.

The wife loves Engel & Bengel, and this is cut from the same cloth. I enjoy this a lot more, however, due to the gambling aspect.

Beth finds it an excellent game as well, and likes the fact that there's plenty of opportunity to screw me over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Simple and luck heavy game.  You bid for the opportunity to roll dice (Yahtzee-style) and attempt to match the 5 dice required in only X rolls (with X being the number shown on the card).  If you succeed, you get a nice payout (plus your bidding money back).  If you fail, you lose your bid money.  Your opponents can place bets on whether you will succeed or fail (2:1 payout if they are correct).  Actually, it's probably better to be sitting on the sidelines and betting.  For this reason, the rules state that you cannot win unless you have collected at least one of the cards (by winning an auction and then succeeding at rolling the required numbers).  Ultimately, the game is won by luck (not shrewd bidding).

A good variation on Yahtzee, as you have to actually make "choices" with consequences.  Played exclusively during a week on vacation in Hilton Head, 2015.

I have seen it at two different thrift shops since then, but have not picked it up because I don't think we would play again.  It was a nice diversion from our normal dice games while we were on vacation, but there are other dice games we enjoy more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We've only played this with two players.  The dice combinations are much harder to get than in regular Yahtzee because you have to roll specific dice.  (For example, instead of a full house, you need to roll exactly 3 fours and 2 fives.)  The betting is incorporated nicely.  You bid on whether or not you think the person will make the roll.  If someone busts, his progress remains and the next person tries to finish the combination from there.  She gets the same number of rolls, which makes it seem easy, but don't forget there are fewer dice, so each die must still match exactly.  Betting wisely is more important than having lucky dice rolls.  The game is fun, but we prefer regular Yahtzee.

Also called Last Chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun gambling exercise where one must quickly calculate the odds of success (in rolling different [i]Yahtzee[/i] combinations) vs. your risk (chips bet) and the expected payout.  If you suck at these things, you will get fleeced until you are chapped and bleeding.  (Of course, you could always trust your gut and hope your intuition is hooked into your math co-processor somehow.)

One aspect I particularly enjoy is the ability to bet for or against the shooter's success; if folks give you the vote of no confidence by betting against you, you can throw it back in their faces by making your numbers and taking their money.  This allows for ripsnorting levels of crowage.

Not recommended for children (or general non-gamer family) as the odds calculation can be troublesome for them, leading to early bankruptcy and player elimination.

All in all a great party game for adults.

It's got a pretty linear track for strategy, but it's fun. With new people and/or a lucky turn, you can break from the monotony. I own Last Chance, and have yet to play Yahtzee Deluxe Poker, which seems to have traded in a lot of LC's verbiage for poker terms, and dropped the values quite a bit (likely to the game's detriment).

SOLD Cool idea that just didn't work for some reason. OK ... I sort of know the reason. The odds of taking a chance to win a card didn't reward the chance taker as much as sitting back and betting against them. It didn't work well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Almost like yahtzee but with bidding.Makes it a more fun game than yahtzee because all players are invovled even when the other players are rolling can you can always bet on them winning the card or not.Also can be tough when playing with 6 players because you can have alot of money that you won from betting but still not have won a card which you need to do to win the game.

This game is a blast to play with adults on a late night of drinking around the table! My only recommendation for a variation to the official rules is to play with more than 7 cards, especially with a larger group of players (try 10 or 13 cards). The game will be slightly longer, but there is more of an opportunity to get the "at-least-one-card" requirement to even be considered for a win.

(10/07/06) Last chance.  Een uiterst simpel dobbelspel (en dat bedoel ik niet negatief).  De eenvoud zelve.  Biedt eerst voor een kaartje (daarop staat de winst, de aantal beurten dat je mag gooien en de dobbel-combinatie).  Lukt het je: proficiat, lukt het je niet pech.  Daarna wordt er opnieuw geboden, tot dat het lukt.  Leuk is ook dat jou medespelers kunnen gokken of het je zal lukken of niet.  Alleen wie min. 1 kaartje heeft kan winnen.  Je moet dan ook nog de meeste centen overhouden.  Fun! (speelden mee: Stevie, Danny, Anke, Danny's vrouw, Frederik en ikzelf)

Yahtzee with side-bets. A mission card is revealed - roll a certain combination in a certain number of rolls to win the reward - which is then bid for. The winner goes for it, whilst everyone else has a 1:1 side bet with the bank on whether they'll get it or not. If he gets it, not only does he get the reward, but he gets all the money that was bet against him. Here's the neat thing. If he fails, the part of the combo he rolled successfully stays there, and the same mission card is bid for again, but with much greater chance of success obviously, attracting higher bids as a result. Almost as an aside, most cash wins. There's not a lot to it, it's just a silly dice-rolling almost-filler, but with a fun loving crowd it can induce a lot of cheering and groaning with everyone invested in each attempt. The game goes just the right length for what it is.

Any game where the participants are hopping up and down and hollering because of the die rolls is a huge winner.

This is not necessarily a terrifically strategic game, but there is a little here. And damn the gambling part is great. Just great.

ZERO down time as people are constantly having opportunity to bet.

I've had this and sold it a few times now. I think it deserves a permanent spot in the collection.

Last Chance is a fun dice game, with some rudimentary strategy.  Every time that I've played it people have shouted or groaned audibly over the rolls of the dice.  If you're in the mood for a lighter, quick dice game with some betting - play this.  This isn't a game I'd want to play ALL the time, but definitely would for the end of the evening closer, hence my six rating.

RATING: 7
Played the game at first without side bet limits, without requiring that a player have a card to be able to win, and without leaving dice on the card once they were rolled to the correct number. Needless to say the game seemed broken. Adding these three rules made the game a much nicer experience.

RATING: 3
Dice game where you have to roll specific combinations of numbers.  You bid for the right to try and score if the dice come up within the allotted number of rolls.  Strategy should be: don't bid.  More often than not, the combination will take a few attempts before it is completed.

RATING: 6.5
Underrated dice/party game. Easy to learn, short duration time, and constantly involves all the players so practically no down time. However, it is a dice game at heart so it can only hold so much strategic play - which comes exclusively from the betting component.

I would recommend adding a sixth die (preferably of a different color) that is used only during the first attempt to complete a card which seems to balance things out a bit.

Despite it stating that it caps off at six players, you could actually play this more, though you would probably have to increase the number of rounds to compensate for the added number.

This is a great party game, capable of playing with a lot of players with little downtime.  It has enough luck that the least analytical player can win, but the most analytical player wins most often.  Everyone has a great time while playing, and it's the game most often requested by non-gamer friends.  It really helps to have someone act as the "caller" (determining when the last bid wins, asking people to place their yes/no bids, in general keeping everyone engaged).

RATING: 6
A good filler game. At it's core it is basically Yahtzee, but the wagering aspect really adds to the game. It would be better if you were trying to roll 2 dice combinations as the probabilities would really factor into your decision making and wagering.

The toughest dice game you'll ever love.  The design is  original which is a huge relief compared to the standard in dice games these days.  This was best described as being an "extreme game" by one of the players at the table.

It can be hard to know how to play this game.  With the requirement that you must buy a tile, there is a real compelling need to get into the dice rolling mix to win the prize.  Sometimes it is tough to finish the job.  As you bleed out money people are making a killing betting against you. 

There is a real balance to all of the actions in the game, and when things get really bad, and you call "Last Chance", to put you back in competition or to eliminate you (rather than having you linger around painfully).

A pretty entertaining dice betting game.  The last time I played, I got caught up in the heat of the moment and keep bidding higher on cards that I "knew" were ready to pay out, even though I knew in my mind that the odds were still the same on any given turn.  A good filler.

Most of the cards are pretty hard to complete, so it might be better to use more than seven cards per game.  It's not that great with two players.  Four or above is probably best.  Don't mind playing once in a while since it's so fast.

A very different game from Yahtzee, this was originally published as Last Chance.  Players have to roll dice to accomplish certain objectives (labeled as Poker Hands), bidding for the opportunity to roll the dice and earn the reward.  From my recollection, the rewards on the Last Chance printing were higher, meaning there was more of an enticement to bid for the opportunity to roll the dice.  In the version I have, it is far easier to make money by betting on the success or failure of the people rolling.

[MB 95 edition] {Economic, Beer&Pretzels, dice; dice-rolling, bidding, betting; optimal 6p} Last chance is an interactive and fun dice game. It's engaging to watch the rolls because the dice roller and the players are directly affected by the dice! The betting theme is very strong in LC, esp. for the "Last Chance!" rule :laugh: It is better played with a G8 timer - it makes the game more exciting.

The rule dictating the winner must at least win a card is very important (and clever). Without this rule, the game will become quite dry.

It's not a pure luck game. Players have to evaluate the odds carefully in the bidding and betting. Judging the correct timing to be the dice roller is very important. Nonetheless, luck is still a primary factor in Last Chance.

[DIY] I am designing "last chance" tokens so that it is easier to remember which player has announced "last chance".

Played 3+ times.  Betting combined with Yahtzee.  You bid to see who's going to get to play the yahtzee turn.  Highest bidder stakes his bid on making the order in a set number of dice re-rolls.  Everyone else can make a side be on making it or not.  If the bidder wins they get their bid back and a pay out based on difficulty.  If the bidder doesn't make it, the card goes back up for auction partially completed.  Most money after 7 cards wins (as long as you finished at least one card). 2009/01/02

The side-betting of Last Chance is a stroke of pure genius, but the unpredictable outcomes quickly seperate players into 2 groups:  those who got at least one lucky big bet early, and those who didn't.  Many will run out of cash too quickly, which dampens the fun.  We add an extra die to the first play of a card, and limit side-betting to one-half of available cash.

Very well-designed betting and bidding game. The game always runs smoothly and hot. There is no downtime unless you go bankruptcy early, but which is very much forgiving due to the short game time with limited number of rounds per game. The game is very fun with 4  players, but also enjoyable as a 3P game. LAST CHANCE... before you bankrupt. :P

The big problem I had with the game (in its original incarnation, but it doesn't sound as if this was changed for the Yahtzee version) is that with a few exceptions the odds are significantly against a player completing a card. This makes betting fairly trivial.

This is a fun, fast blend of poker and Yahtzee, with the luck and bluff working off of each other perfectly.  Much better than I would have expected.  There's a nice balance in the way the game is designed, but if one player makes a foolish wager on another player's roll, it can throw the game to that player, much like it would in a game of Modern Art.

I liked the idea of having specific goals to achieve when dice rolling, and got it because for $4.49 I'd at least get a dice tray and some chips out of it.  Well ... the tray and chips were cheap -- but useable.  I got my money's worth.

The gameplay is so-so.  It's rare to achieve the goals on the first attempt.  With the right mix of people, this could be a fun filler game, but not often.

Nice push your luck game that introduces betting. Similar to Sharp Shooters, but not as clean or crisp. Can drag on forever with some bids just never getting fulfilled. I like the side betting options to let players who aren't the active roller to still make some money, but after a while, it feels like only the bets for the 2 or 3 leading players matter any more.

Some interesting decisions during game play. I'm intrigued by the tile design, and feel that there's more going on here than meets the eye (either that, or far less going on than meets the eye).

The rules are explained in seconds, if not a few short minutes. The game starts quickly, but then becomes chess-like in a way -- a good thing, not a bad thing.

We have not played with the expansion at this point, but see how that can make things interesting as well. We'll see.

[2-6] A great brain burner that really manages to level the playing field without giving too much of the mechanics up to luck.  However, I can't seem to figure out the strategy behind it yet (I'm also looking forward to trying the stocks expansion).  The look is gorgeous, though, and is simply incredible when the game is finished.  The wife also really enjoys this one as well!

1st play: A much better Tsuro.  I played this with the stock variant which to me seems like the obviously good way to play.  Laying tracks and trying to create routes while hoping that the person next to you is working for the same companies you are.  Short playtime and easy rules put this squarely in filler/gateway range, but enjoyable at any level.

2nd play: Played again with the basic game and 3 non-gamers and it was fun.  I don't really enjoy Tsuro because it's over so fast but with 8 scoring opportunities this is just the right length.  The board is appealing and the production is great.  I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy the non-stock version but it makes this game perfect for scaling complexity.  I'm not quite sure this is a 7 but if it isn't, it's a high 6.

Playing with the stockholder rules bumps this up at least a whole point on my rating.  Without it, you can really squash any one player but with it in place, even if you correctly guess an opponents preferred color, they can dump it, switch, and keep on rolling if things aren't looking good.

08+, 2-6 players, best with ?, 45 mins. Originally published in 1997 as Iron Horse and in 2000 as Metro. CC has a different theme, new artwork and components and rules to play new, optional variant "Cable Car Company", introducing stock holding. We also have Metro so probably don't need that - other than for the train theme perhaps ...

A lightweight package featuring two mechanically similar and yet objectively different games which can easily be taught to nongamers.

The components included are fantastic, with nice little wooden cable cars, a large board, sturdy cards and beautiful tiles.  But the the box it comes in is horribly oversized, with it being around the size of a Tales of the Arabian Nights or Cyclades box but only needing an Agricola/ Stone Age sized one.

And now for the two games:

Cable Car, a rehashed Metro, is a simple tile laying game which can be played in under an hour.  Features some vicious play as players seek to both extend their cable car lines along with lacerating the lines of their opponents.  But as exciting as my last comment may seem, Cable Car is ultimately too light, lucky and puzzly.  In that while the end look of the game looks great, reaching the outcome was very random and felt devoid of any strategy.

Cable Car Company switches the base game up by introducing shares.  Here, players don't control any one cable car company, instead they own shares of varying values.  Provides a bit more to think about than Cable Car, but I fear that the end result is really the same as it's simpler younger brother in that Cable Car Company is equally light, lucky and puzzly.  Nevertheless the shares are nice in that it allows players the chance to "jump ship" from losing companies as they hope to acquire more valuable shares.  I like it better than Cable Car, but hate the spreadsheet scoring ending.

Cable Car is a decent package to introduce board game newbies to, but those looking for tile laying fillers that are fun or feature more substance should look elsewhere (my favorites being Carcasonne and Infinite City).  If anything Cable Car is the best game I've played featuring an aspect of my home state.

My rating is for the advanced game with shares. The basic is much more fun which I rated 7/10 (see Metro). In basic game you don't think too much, just lay a tile to help your cars or screw the opponents. 30 minutes, you're done and that's it, fun light game, a little lighter than TTR. In advanced though, you have to manage these shares which might seem strategic, but I think is just chaotic. The game even introduces some AP which is pointless.

PS
And why the game is packed to this irrationally huge box? No idea.

This game kinda feels like advanced T'suro... 

Each person starts with one each of a stock showing you own 40%/30%/20%/10% (The percentages are kinda dumb. It's fair simpler if you just think of it as a share per 10%). At the end of the game you score points based on how much of the stock you have with a bonus for majority share holder in each train. The board is setup with cable cars of different colors surrounding the board, one of each color train per side of the board. On your turn you place a tile to move cable cars along the tracks on the tile placed. Points are scored based on tiles traveled. Person with the most points win.

The run time on the game is longer then T'suro. It plays less player then T'suro. It has the same draw back of people complaining that it's too simple like T'suro. I like this wayyyyy more then T'suro. I really enjoy the stock element. The cat and mouse game that can be played trying to make people figure out what color you are working for... and making last ditch desperation stock trades trying to catch up when you figure out you are being crushed. 

I recommend that you should at least give this one a try if you are looking for a slightly more advanced family style game, but be warned, if you take a face up stock, that color is doomed!

Most impressive game.  Have had Metro for some time and it has seen quite a few plays.  This new version updates the basic mechanics with a 'share' variant that adds much more depth to the game, changing the original idea in a very basic way.  Opportunities for screwage are abundant and now an inherent part of the game.  Make certain when playing with newer players that they all understand the scoring at the end.

This one replaces Tsuro and Indigo for me. Far more interesting decisions, and so many mind-numbing paths to keep track of make this both challenging and amusingly frustrating as you lay a tile only to realize you just scored your opponent ten points. Beautiful, beautiful board and bits, and a cool, unusual setting for a game.

Rated 7 after one play. Pretty clever route game, with "hidden stocks" in approx. 10 different cable car colors. The turns are simple, but there's some fun decisions to make in attempting to route your preferred colors where you want.

This probably gets better with familiarity. For a first-time look at the board, the routes look like spaghetti. This is on the verge of being something I'd want to pick up. It's certainly unique enough.

RATING: 7.25
Traded for Cable Car to replace my Metro version.  Cable Car has bigger tiles/board, a stock market variant, and softer/thematic tiles to look at.  When you are finished, it makes a great scene.

The storage box is a bit big for the game.  Wish they would have made it smaller or the components/board bigger.

The game at its heart is a puzzle game.  You are either trying to maximize your routes, or shorten the length of others.  It is important for everyone to start studying their tiles before their turn, so I always issue them at the end of your turn.


Metro Comments (2007):
Received in trade June 2007.  This is a nice tile placing game.  I would say  its a cross between Carcassone and Ticket to Ride.  Probably more Carc because of the tile laying component, but its a bit like TTR because of trying to make the destination to the middle.  Either way, it was very easy to read thru the rules and get my first play in with my kids.  This plays very much like puzzle and makes you pretty dizzy by the end.

Replaces Metro
Players place square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible. Players start with a number of cars ringing the board. When a tile placement connects a car to a station (either to those on the edge or to the power station in the center of the board), that car is turned to indicate it has been scored and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses.

Solid tile laying, path-completing game that gains even more depth if you use the "Stocks" expansion.  I disliked Tsuro for being far too simplistic and limited in choices to make, even though I prefer lighter fare, so this game was more to my liking.  I will agree that it is best with at least 3 players.

The remake of Metro, which is a remake of Iron Horse, and the only changes are in the production values. Essentially a maze game set in the San Francisco cable car route system.   You have to place tiles onto a gridded board with the object of making your lines as long and as complex as possible, while terminating the lines of the other players as quickly as possible. You score points for your lines based on the number of tiles your line enters, double if you terminate it in the centre of the board. Can be played in two ways - traditional Metro/Iron Horse, or with a stock investment system (unplayed).  In comparison with Metro, this is a much larger box (was that necessary?), and the orientation of the tiles is a little harder to get right.  I'll have to try the stock system to pass final judgment.

Really, I love Metro.  Knew I would before I played it.

And you know what?

Although I had reviewed the available Cable Car (with an expansion, no less), I had thought it was less purty than the original form, so until I played Metro, I only had Metro on the list.

Once I played Metro, I knew I had to get Cable Car, stat.

I didn't want to wait until I could find OOP Metro, so I would suffer through the 2nd Tier art of Cable Car, without the helpful orientation arrows, and... you know what?

(I keep saying that.)

I like the Cable Car art better, even though I had dismissed it when looking through the galleries for the games.  I like the subtle orientation clues in the house roofs.  They're easier to see than I thought they would, and they don't stand out like a big, honking neon sign saying "This Way, You Fool!"

I haven't tried the Cable Car Company expansion yet, but it will just add variety to a game I already enjoy the heck out of.

Would be a '6' if not for the terrible graphic design.  The stock shares have only a hint of color, and are thus hard to see from across the table, and the track tiles have the track printed in such a light, artistic weight that you need to look hard to see them.

RATING: 6
Plays best with the stock share rules; otherwise, without I would rather play Tsuro. What keeps me from wanting to play it more is that rail artwork is not as clearly defined as Tsuro and therefore causes more down time between turns making sure a play is legal or analysis paralysis to maximize a play. Sold.

Yes it's Metro, but this time it has great production.  The board is bigger, the tiles larger and thicker.  I can't say the lines are any easier to see though.  The scoreboard actually has enough room on it now to accommodate the player markers!

Update Dec'12: I decided eventually to pass Metro on, even though Metro is smaller and more portable and usually goes on Holiday with us.  With game space at a premium I didn't really need two versions of the same game.

This is a fun game that's easy to teach and quick to play.

Either choice is fine.  This is a good game to own.

RATING: 6.5
Possibly the simplest tile-laying game there is. This is the same game as Metro, but this is the better version; prettier artwork, and an included variant involving shares that makes for a different experience (I assume; haven't tried it yet). The gameplay is largely tactical, with little opportunity to execute a long-term strategy. This is very much at the lighter end of the complexity spectrum. Play time is short.

Very fun game! Carcassonne / Tsuro mash-up. I absolutely hate Tsuro so it was nice to find this as a replacement. I suspect it is probably best with 3-4. I have only played 2, and 4. It is just meh with 2, but won't turn down a play. With 4 players it started to get a bit chaotic, but still a ton of fun. MUCH more tactical versus strategic at 4+. I think it might be too chaotic with 5-6?? I hope to try it out to be sure though. This game shot up in rating for me after playing the Cable Car Company expansion! It feels like a completely different game. Two games for the price of one!!!! EXCELLENT!!! The company expansion kind of adds in Paris Connection to the mix with the two aforementioned games. Two SOLID games for less that $15... what a steal!! Will play this any time!

I picked this up hoping for a quick, light game with some Ticket to Ride visible in its DNA, and which both my gaming group and our spouses would enjoy -- and that's what I got.

Apart from the too-large box, Cable Car has gorgeous components. I particularly like the look of the board after all of the tiles are in place.

We play with the stock expansion, and it's more tactical then strategic, but there's strategy, too. The threshold beyond which no more stock trading is allowed comes up quickly, and it can be hard to know when to blink.

It seems like switching stock quite a bit early on, with the goal of getting a diverse portfolio, is key -- as is projecting ahead to the likely maximum score for colors you care about.

Overall, a nifty game.

For the life of me, I do not understand the low rating for this game on BGG.  I truly wonder if people are playing without the stocks (essentially [i]Metro[/i]).

While the game is easily accessible, it has strategic depth.  You have to not only focus on lengthening the tracks of your trains, but also on reading your opponents' holdings and thwarting their efforts.

[i]Cable Car[/i] has a nice blend of hidden information and requirement of rough mathematical calculations to determine whether you should elongate, block or trade for a new stock.  It sets up and plays as fast as a filler game, but I would not call it that.

Beautiful pictures and artwork and easy to learn gameplay.

Plays a bit like Tsuro with tile laying that can help you or hurt others.

The stock market expansion is pretty good and adds a different playstyle and your more serious gamers might really need that added level of depth.  It isn't deep, but the base game is really fast and quite simple (though it does require strategy).

We enjoy games where if you can't help yourself, then you can hurt others.  Always a nice alternative in tile laying games.

RATING: 6.5
I'm on the fence with this one. It's not bad, but I feel like the game is almost too simple, you're doing exactly one thing (place a tile) throughout the whole game and while the artwork is nice, I think the visual clarity is a bit of an issue. What's worse, the box is taking up way too much space.

I'm keeping the game for now, I moved it into the box of Carcassonne Big Box.

This is basically Tsuro but with more depth. You place tiles with lines on them, trying to make the longest connections for your cable car (and get to the power station for double points!)The Cable Car Company expansion adds more strategy where you collect shares of specific colors and then try to get those colors to score the most points. Some of the other people in my playgroup had issues with following the lines and where they ended, but I had no issues with it.

A bit more frisson than in Metro, as the color you're playing isn't obvious, leading to some intrigue. Probably also less hurt feelings, as you don't know whom you're sabotaging when you end a line prematurely. The tile artwork is nicer than Metro but also harder to read. For a game this light, it's disconcerting the amount of AP that can arise.

This game was billed as a refinement of the game Metro, a tile-laying game where you wanted to create long routes for your train and short routes for others.  Overall, I found this game to be very random and pretty frustrating, particularly because I a lot of times I couldn't place my tiles where they wanted because they would hurt my opponents too much (and there was a rule against that).  Not much here.

I've rated an 8.5 after three plays of the basic game. I love tile-laying, path-building games that I can teach in three minutes and enjoy playing myself. I like this more than Tsuro, and I think it absolutely has the best artwork of any board game I've played. Those tiles up close are gorgeous, and the game looks great once all of them have been played and the cable cars have arrived at their stations. Even though my library has a copy to borrow, I'm seriously considering purchasing a copy for myself.

I found Cable Car a pretty uninspiring game of route-building. The components may be attractive but I felt they obscured the gameplay. I found it hard to look at the board and see where the routes were going and we even had a couple of tiles placed upside-down without anyone noticing.

RATING: 6
This is a solid game to play with people who don't really play games, or aren't as enthusiastic.  It is easy to teach and learn, and there aren't a lot of elements mixed in.  I think this makes it easy for newbies to feel like they have a shot at winning and that there aren't those hidden strategies that more experienced players may know like in more complex games.  Basically, it is easy to wrap your brain around, and you don't have to take it too seriously to have a shot at winning.

a great simple game. keeps you thinking the whole time.  much better than i expected.  Can be very chaotic with more players.  Becomes more of a game of who's rail survives the longest.  Like this better with less player actually.One downside compared to the original Metro is that the orientation of the tiles is a little difficult because they don't have the arrow on the bottom so you have to go by the art of the tile which can easily be mistaken.

It annoys me when the game designer does not stick to a single standard way of playing the game, and Cable Car comes with two additional variants in the box. So I'm not sure how to judge this: without rotation of the tiles, with rotation of the tiles, with a hand or 2-3 tiles, or a combination of two? Carcassonne at least has a standard (with rotation, no hand).

Even so, none of the variants solve the basic problem (beyond adding downtime). The 12 starting positions (in a 2-player game) means you are nearly indifferent on where to put your tiles in the first half of the game, then when it actually does matter, it's more regretting where you randomly placed your first few tiles than examining how your opponent outclassed you. This is extremely unsatisfying and frustrating.

Haven't played with the Cable Car expansion yet, but it's a simple take-it-or-leave-it rule that doesn't address the game's problems either.

1+1

RATING: 7
When I first heard that this game was going to be a redone version of Metro with an expansion included, I though I would definitely be picking up a copy.  Then I found it in the BGG.con library.  That changed my mind.

Problem number one is the size of the box.  The box has the same footprint as Wallenstein/Shogun and is about 2/3 as deep.  This for a game that was originally publsihed in a box about a quarter of that size.  I might could live with that if the contents of the box even remotely justified such a large box, which they don't.

The other problems is the expansion.  The expansion is interesting enough, though it does seem somewhat constrained.  Unfortunately, I could make a copy and include it in my much more compact copy of Metro. 

As an aside, I didn't see in the rules the limitation from Metro of having only a single pawn on any given space on the scoring track, but then, I didn't look too closely.

Overall, I have nothing really against this production, but then I have no reason to add it to my collection either.  Basically, this means it gets nearly the same rating as Metro, with a slight ding for the box size.  [12/05/2009]

The best way to classify this game is to ignore the Metro rules and only go for the "stock" expansion. I've only played it with two players which doesn't seem to be the best format for this variant. I do prefer Metro with 2 players only but I think this one needs more players to show what it can achieve as a gaming experience.

I like the artwork but it's definitely much more difficult to read than the older Metro one.

Fun, easy game. The game comes with two distinct variants so it took two plays to experience the whole game once. The basic game is really pretty basic - easy rules, simple strategy; it's Tsuro on steroids. The "stock market" variant added some hidden knowledge and a bit more strategy to the otherwise pretty simple game. Play again? Yeah, but the basic game is really too basic for my tastes normally. I would reserve this game for use with non-gamers to lure them into the hobby.

Slightly chaotic with 6, but with this number it essentially becomes little more than a good filler.

I think it'd be better with fewer players (and probably best with 2-4) but I've only played it with 6.

Update: Played again with 5 - still mildly entertaining but fairly brainless fun. Essentially your choices are 'do I try and score myself or dick someone else over?'. One outcome results in you winning, the other in you having fun.

We also tried the shares option with 4 players. I think the general consensus was that it was more interesting but less fun.

Cable Car is a reprint of Metro, and it's the better game by a sliver.  The new art is prettier, but the tiles and are harder to orient.  The stock market adds intrigue, but there are colormatch issues between the cards and the pieces.  The bigger box holds a larger board but also a lot of air.  Metro is more portable.  Cable Car should have been a slam-dunk improvement, but Queen bobbled the details and the two games earn the same rating.  Both are great.

Cable Car is a reworked rerelease of the the game originally published in 1997 by db-Spiele as Iron Horse and in 2000 by Queen Games as Metro, with a different theme, new artwork and the components and rules to play the new, optional variant "Cable Car Company," which introduces stock holding to the game.
Players place square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible. Players start with a number of cars ringing the board. When a tile placement connects a car to a station (either to those on the edge or to the power station in the center of the board), that car is turned to indicate it has been scored and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses.
(Slightly reworded for clarity and consistency from Queen Games' announcement of the game.)

Cable car is basically Metro with new art work and a expansion that can be used to change the game up a bit.

It's light enjoyable tile laying, very easy to teach non-gamers.

Great with 2-4 players, not a fan of 5-6 players.

The stock version sounded interesting but proved not to be so in actual play. As soon as it became clear that a few lines were dogs, people swapped their shares in those. But not everyone got a chance to do so while there was still anything decent left to exchange for, and there was no way to improve holdings later, since all that was left were the dregs.

With fewer players it might work better, but plain Metro is fine with a small number of players too, so what's the point?

Good family game light and quick. All the components are beautiful  but the box is wastefully gigantic.

This is a nice change up from ticket to ride.

Cable Car is a reworked rerelease of the the game originally published in 1997 by db-Spiele as Iron Horse and in 2000 by Queen Games as Metro, with a different theme, new artwork and the components and rules to play the new, optional variant "Cable Car Company," which introduces stock holding to the game.

Players place square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible. Players start with a number of cars ringing the board. When a tile placement connects a car to a station (either to those on the edge or to the power station in the center of the board), that car is turned to indicate it has been scored and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses.
(Slightly reworded for clarity and consistency from Queen Games' announcement of the game.)

[gameid=559], with a variant where you hide your color by having shares of different track colors.

very random tile-laying game where you just can't see where the tracks lead because it looks so chaotic

Only played the base game - Metro style - so won't rate yet. Not keen on Metro though.

This is my rating for the shareholding version. The basic Cable Car IS Metro.

This new version is a little more interesting but it suffer of analysis paralysis if played with the wrong people as it is quite cahotic and uncontrollable, expecially if played with a lot of people.
The Metro version, when played lightly with children is better... just see what happens.

(20) tile laying game, similar mechanics to tsuro and carcassonne and includes a stock owning expansion... artwork is nicer than regular metro... enjoyed this game a lot

Missing a single station (from one of the higher player count colours (it was missing when I bought it brand new in shrink)

Cable Car takes a mediocre game (Metro) and increases its "value for money" by including a mediocre stock variant.

Tomorrow I will apply a similar management approach as I both fire and spank my employees at the same time.  

I'm pretty sure that this will be OK with at least one employee, as she's been hinting at this possibility for months.

This is an update to Metro which updated Iron Horse. The big board and beautiful tiles are nice. The new wrinkle in the game is stocks. You don't own one color but a variety. You have one 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% share. These shares can be switched early in the game so you try to get rid of the losers and hope you get a better color. No need to buy it if you own Metro.

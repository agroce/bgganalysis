I love the idea of this game- Eldritch Horror Lite with lots of dice rolling- what can be bad? But the pieces are tiny and fiddly, the characters are literally smaller than dimes. As a tactile or visual experience, the game fails but I guess gets points for portability. Must be played with Gates of Arkham expansion unless playing with children or new gamers.

My one and only dice game, as I detest King of Anything, is the co-op Elder Sign. While I'm far more likely to play this solo as a pure co-op (I feel it plays better as a solo) its a decently fun dice chucker with a nice theme, and enough strategy mixed in to stop it from always being the dice's fault - just sometimes!

Too long and no connection between mechanics and theme. Game feels totally abstract despite nice components, good illustrations etc. That would be ok if the mechanisms were ok, but alas... Solo got to repetitive, and since I got it only for solo it had to go. Almost unplayable with more than one (but I really don't like cooperative play so don't take me too seriously if you do).

This feels very much like Arkham Horror Lite (which is not a bad thing, necessarily). 

With that said, I find the rules surrounding the dice mechanic somewhat stilted and contrived, but that is just me perhaps. This doesn't seriously affect my desire to get this on the table, so I'll happily live with this particular wart.

Played this at a friend's house while a little intoxicated, and made a drunken impulse buy of it on Amazon Prime.  No regrets - it's quickly become one of my favorites.  Can't go wrong with a 1920s Cthulu-style theme, and the dice rolls are always suspenseful when someone is completing a task.

RATING: 7.5
Fun coop game (if you can bear a lot of dice rolls, and the resulting randomness), which I usually play solo (with 2 characters).
There's quite a lot of randomness, but you still have to choose well to have a chance of winning the game.
I very much like Lovecraft's work, and in this game the theme is well represented (obviously not as much as in larger games like eldritch/arkham horror, but it is quite enjoyable). You obviously have to get over the fact that you are going around throwing explosive and shooting around, which is something never found in any of Lovecraft's works.

This game really shines with the gates of arkham expansion, adding some more theme and difficulty (which is needed after some games), together with some interesting new mechanics. GoA is the last expansion published in Italy, so I haven't tried omens of ice yet (but it looks great!)

The main negative aspect is that the setup/tear down is very boring (not particularly long, but you have to shuffle something like 10 decks of cards). I'd say that a custom inserted (I made one like this https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/115468/item/3814058#item3814058) is necessary to avoid having to use a lot of ziplocks to divide everything.

I really like Elder Sign, but I must confess, I have a thing for dice. I love dice. So this game fits well for me. My complaint is that it feels too easy as a co-op game, however I have not played with the Gates of Arkham expansion, which I've heard can make it more difficult. I'll probably also modify some rules to increase difficulty and enjoy it more.

Very enjoyable game. It can be a little difficult to explain, but it is a great, fun cooperative game with an exciting Lovecraftian theme. Relative to Arkham and Eldritch, this game is the most approachable, and the 90-minute playtime makes it more versatile. I particularly appreciate how well-integrated the theme is. This game would have scored even higher if this game had more actual cooperation (players helping each other) as opposed to merely players trying to achieve the same objective and (at best) providing healing.

I've only played it once, but it went over well. Lots of suspenseful dice rolling followed by lots of groans when they didn't land how we wanted them to. I agree with many of the complaints that the theme of Arkham Horror is a tad lost in its translation to a dice game, but that doesn't diminish the fun.

We lost, by the way.

Enjoyable game that doesn't overstay its welcome, and a personal favorite of my parents (between this and pandemic). Simple rules with enough variety in the locations, monsters, and great ones for many playthroughs. Minor dislike in the rules (no sharing items except spells), but I understand it was probably for balance purposes. Also can be fairly easy, with about 80% victory chance from my experience; whether this is considered good or bad would be up to the individual.

RATING: 10
I own ~200 games... this one's flexible player count and co op means this always hits the table, and is not too heavy on the rules so it gets picked up very fast (and new players can see a few turns before taking theirs so they know how to play quickly). Despite dozens and maybe over a hundred plays of this (seriously) this game still hasn't gotten old for me. This box is very loved/worn out from so much opening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you enjoy the Lovecraftian theme, you'll find this one fun - but I'm not sure about balance. One time we won and it was a little close (5-player). The second play we easily won - without even breaking a sweat (4-player). The folks I played with really enjoyed it - and I think it fits well as a game for late at night with several moments of shouting at the outcome of a close roll. That's all great. But for a co-op - if it's too easy to beat, that could be a problem for long term play.

Basically Yahtzee with an Arkham Horror theme.  I don't like Arkham Horror and I play Yahtzee only if I have to.  It also has a ton of chrome...most of it unnecessary.  For dice fest games, I think Kingsburg and Giganten Der Luft are way superior - and games I am happy to play.

Played this for the first time the other day.  I didn't do a single useful thing in the game, thanks to terrible die rolls.  I even died and came back as another investigator and still did nothing of use.

However, the other four people playing managed to pull us out of an incredibly awful start and win in the end!  It was pretty epic how they saved the day, though I felt like a spectator to their greatness...

The good:
-fun theme
-Exciting to do the tasks knowing what you're risking and the possible reward and it all hinges on your dice rolls. It makes the individual task fun.

The bad:
-It's basically co-op without cooperation. There aren't any meaningful mechanics to allow you work together. Sure you can deliberate about what to do, but even that hasn't meant much since...
-Choices are easy. It's pretty no-brainer what you need to do and which tasks to go for.
-The game itself is too easy. Co-ops should be more tense and you actually feel like you might lose.

RATING: 6
Mythos Yahtzee! This game is an acceptable version of Arkham Horror because it is just as random but much less of a time investment. You play a team of investigators trying to stop a random great old one from waking up by going through all the standard call of Cthulu tropes with the typical characters from the genre and time period. The only reason I'm trading it away is that it is better as an app than a board game.

Really fun game with a great theme.  I don't own Arkham or Eldrich Horror so this is the only incarnation I have of this series.  I play solo only and find it to be challenging but without too much AP.  Yes there is luck involved with the dice rolling but it is mitigated with good strategy -- you have to think a couple of moves ahead sometimes.  I don't think it's as easy as others claim.  I'll definitely be playing this game a lot and will most likely start acquiring their expansions.

Did feel a bit like themed version of that famous dice game at first.  After several plays, though, I don't think of it that way any more.  Once you get into the AH theme, you don't worry about that as much.  Great for those of us who grew up watching classic Universal horror films.

Excellent solo game that's arguably better than the cooperative multiplayer mode due to lack of downtime. Not really 'lucky' as some players think, more about correctly judging probabilities and item management.  Good theme, components and great value for money. Low ranking on BGG due to the bias towards strategy and resource management games and those who don't like or understand dice rolling mechanics.  One criticism could be that the game is way to easy, although this is mitigated a bit by drawing random characters. Also, there's a fair bit of downtime with more than three players.

Arkham Horror Lite.  Each play gets a turn, they go to a location, roll dice until they either succeed at a challenge or fail and that is the entire game.  Have to do it before the ancient old one awakens though or you will either lose out right or have to fight it.

Play time is way too long for what it is. Nice trappings but it is composed of the boring core structure of Eldritch/Arkham Horror etc. - roll dice, random bad things happen.

The base game is alright for about 10 plays. Then it feels a bit stagnant and easier.

A better game than the rating, but for some mysterious reason, I have horrific dice luck in these type of games, and no matter how solid a design, when it all goes bad -- REALLY bad -- it will take away from your enjoyment level, and my dice luck in these type of horror games is statistically, nay, supernaturally bad.

I probably enjoyed it more than Arkham Horror (AH), but that is because when your luck is horrific, you'd just as soon not have the game drag out when you know you are going to lose.  However, if you are a big Arkham Horror fan, and want a dice game that captures theme but in a short, quick format, I don't think this is going to scratch your itch.  You don't get the feel for solving a mystery or fighting monsters, but rather rolling dice and matching symbols.  Not that this is bad thing, but I'm guessing AH fans are in it for the story more than the mechanics.

It isn't as close to the original game than, say, [thing=12]Ra's[/thing] dice [thing=35503] variant [/thing] is to it, but that's because Ra is a Euro and has no theme, so the dice do not take away from a non-existent story.  So if I liked this more, why did I rate it lower?  Because if I were to experience a "normal" game of each (where my dice luck isn't supernaturally bad), I would like the original better and wouldn't mind the length of the game.

+ Rolling lots of dice is fun; Has a theme similar to Arkham Horror, but plays in much less time.
- In the end, there was too much luck for a cooperative for me.


Why it's previously-owned:
While rolling tons of dice is inexplicably satisfying, it just seemed that there was no real need for cooperation between the players to succeed in this co-op.
I gave this game away to a friend who enjoyed the times that we played.  If I had to only play one co-op, it definitely would be Ghost Stories.

This is Arkham Horror stripped of a lot of its theme, with mostly random dice-chucking for mechanics, all while still taking a couple hours to get through.

FAVOURITE GAME - This is a quite nice, and fast-paced cooperative game, where you have to fulfill different tasks by rolling dice for different locations represented by cards. It is very luck based, but by acquiring weapons, skills and magical abilities you can somewhat mitigate it. It plays extremly well in 2-player mode, with more players you have to be very careful how you plan and use your abilities as the Ancient One can awake very quickly. And yes, this game is also based on the Lovecraftian universe. It has a huge replayability thanks to the many cards it provides.

Took us 1 1/2 hours for a 2 player game with just 1 Elder Sign short of stopping the Ancient One coming. Took another half and hour to kill it.

Otherwise, the dice rolling is similar to RISK Dice game.

A board game for Lovecraft geeks. Whilst Elder Sign is, for someone aware of the Cthulhu Mythos, a game where those terror stories come alive, you need to read the flavour text as the Ancient One awakens. With no narrative to add, the game itself runs the risk of becoming a tedious rolling and re-rolling of dice.

It's mostly a pretty shallow dice game. But the bells and whistles on Elder Sign make it a bit more interesting than a lot of the other popular dice games. 

I appreciate the co-op gameplay in the context of a narrative game telling a story. It's more interesting than more competitive dice games where players chuck dice at each other until a winner is determined. Elder Sign doesn't overstay it's welcome. So it's a decent game when I'm in the mood to roll some dice.

An intriguing game of Eldrich dice rollery with some genuinely tense moments. The pieces are too tiny for grown-up hands, and the text is too tiny for grown-up eyes. How many more times will Fantasy Flight re-purpose this artwork though?

Eldritch horror light. Immersion to the theme is only self service of reading the flavor text, and talking about how the items specifically apply to the monsters....want expansions fairly quickly though for more variety.

RATING: 8.5
It plays super solo with a much smaller footprint then the other games in the series. As a solo player this is the best place to start with the franchise. Or try The Cards of Cthulhu, an independent solitaire game.

RATING: 7
My initial reaction of the game was very favorable, and while I still like the game I feel like my rose colored glasses are off. The game obviously suffers from a lack of strategy as players are at the mercy of the dice. At times this can become frustrating, and furthermore, it can hurt the experience. While I still contend that this is a good game and a fun game, I must admit that it no longer gets much play with my gaming group due to being burned out and too luck driven.

RATING: 8.5
Love this game. A good, often tense, but not impossible challenge. Does a decent job of getting across the creepy Lovecraft theme. Works great as a moderately meaty solitaire game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5

The game is just ok and a bit repetitive. What really kills it is the fact that it is my duty to to place the monsters that appear wherever I want.
Althought the game artwork and visual presentation are awesome, they do not add up to a more immersive experience (I canÂ´t help but wonder why the reason of having sanity and also healthy counters if they are both essencially life points).
Rate it a 6.5 for the production and visual presentation. 
Traded away.

*amended extra: Though I didn't like the physical version of ES, I've found myself absolutely enjoying the iPhone/iPad implementation. This may be due to the fact that I do not have to worry about keeping track of doom track, clock counter, sanity and health. Also the lovely eerie piano track makes it way more immersive.
I'd give the app a 7.5.
:)

The flavor (and characters, and GOOs, and art) of Arkham Horror, but with a Yahtzee-style resolution mechanic instead of the usual die pool.  Much slower than the other Yahtzee-for-gamers games, but still faster than AH.

A dice chucking coop. There's plenty of decisions to make every turn but it's not a brain burner and it's just a game that's fun to play when you want a fix of mythos without the hours of setup of arkham horror.

RATING: 4
An attempt to condense Arkham Horror into a small box package playable in an hour.  Sadly, in the process much of the mythos flavour is lost. I never felt as though I was solving mysteries or battling horrors; I was just rolling combinations of dice.  And, really, who wants to play Yahtzee for an hour or more?

What's more, as others have commented, Elder Sign seems too easy.  The name of the game is a big clue as to what you need to do - collect elder signs.  Even when we failed to take that hint in our first game, four of us still managed to down Nyarlathotep in a final confrontation.

Artwork and production quality are up to Fantasy Flight's usual good standards.

Average cooperative game using dice. Players are investigators trying to stop an Ancient One from entering our world. The artwork is excellent.
The thing is that gameplay is very random and there aren't a lot of ways for the players to help each other. There are better cooperative games that actually require from the players to plan ahead and coordinate their actions.

This one's a bit hit or miss. A couple of people in the group aren't big on dice games so it doesn't see a lot of outings. I do enjoy it though and I love the themeing. It's a bit difficult with six players because not everyone is close enough to read the cards.

Tons of plays as a solitaire (the app helps bump these numbers even more).  I've played with a fill complement as well but doesn't really hold up as well in large group play.  The theme while good, is a bit pasted on with the dice rolling.

Fairly straightforward and somewhat limited game where quests/missions are solved by rolling dice, which is of course heavily luck based. I like the game, but would like to see some more variety in the way dice are allocated and extra dice gained. Too many item cards do exactly the same thing.

A fun experience! Can be a little fiddly at times. Definitely can be very swingy. Can have a very easy game or an impossible game based on dice luck. This leads to moments of extreme joy when your last die rolls exactly what you need and you win, or when you grow to hate it when you consistently cant roll whats needed in the easiest situations. Some will hate that but I usually have a good time.

An exciting gaming experience with comparatively (!) easy rules; it does not take up so much room on the table and has a faster setup than other games taking place in and around Arkham, but it generates a feeling that reminds the players of Arkham Horror and related games; it has a very lever mechanism that lets you investigate Arkham Museum at night and creates a lot of atmosphere and suspense.

Fun game once you get the hang of the rules. Interesting mix of luck and strategy for a dice game. Some of the characters can be a little frustrating to play with and sour the mood on occasion.

This is no corporative game, where do your share items, share info, you can focus another's player's die, that is it. I would barely call it a game. What it is Yahtzee, and Tom Vasel eats this stuff up. Seems to love rehashed Lovecraft. The theme could have been anything, how about Egyptian, or Mediterranean and long has it has endless dice rolling.

I really like this game, the rules are easy, the game is very interesting, you can play with a lot of people, the art is cool and most of all it's the first game that my girlfriend likes.

The only reason I don't give the game a 10 is that sometimes the game is really easy, I have only played it with a few people so I don't know if it gets harder with more people.

Overall it is a great game, you can add some house rules to make it more difficult.

Be as negative as you want. Yes, there is a !@#$%^&-ton of luck in this game. We actually beat Hastur recently without ever getting a Doom token on his card. Yes, it does all come down to dice-rolling. But the game never professes to be anything but that. A dice-rolling game. And for our money it is the best dice-rolling game out there and themed quite nicely.

RATING: 6
Not awful, but lacking real thematic "punch." Still feels more like rolling dice than seeking out arcane knowledge and fighting off Elder gods. (2016-04-28)

Returning to the game with a homemade play mat and some variant house rules has bumped up the theme on this one. Also using figures to move from location to location, instead of using tiny given tokens. We'll see if it continues to hold up. Later expansions like "Omens" reportedly develop much more thematically, so looking forward to that. (2017-04-05)

This is pretty much Advanced Risk:Express. Roll dice, match symbols, reroll. But the items and skills allow lots of manipulation and fun effects. I have the iOS app and enjoy it quiet a bit. Probably would not buy the physical version as the app keeps coming out with great scenario add ons at a fraction of the price.

Having just played the physical game. The downtime is awful! max three players I think for this to tick along nicely. More variety than the app with the different ancient ones but ultimately a bit fiddly for what it is. I much prefer full Arkham Horror for a sense of story.

Decent dice rolling cooperative game that can play up to eight players. A luck-driven game with some added strategy and a few ways to swing luck in your favor.

This game fills a niche in my collection ... I was searching for a game to play solo and without too much complexity. The game is about preventing an ancient one from awakening collecting elder sings before the time runs out or fight against it if you fail to get all the signs. This is accomplished by rolling dice, hence there is a lot of luck involved and perhaps too little decisions to make throughout the game ... and most of the time those decisions are dictated by the adventure cards that come in your way.

Aside from the fact that it marginally gives the feel of Arkham Horror (probably evoked more through reused artwork than anything else)and certainly sets up much quicker, this game has very little that makes me want to play it.

Well, this is better suited to shorter sessions and the dice mechanic is great, especially if you're into other games like King of Tokyo, Age of War, Bang the Dice Game, etc. But it does such a great job with the theme, and despite being generally easy to pick up, it does have some added complexities.

A very good and light Cthulhu-lite game about stopping the awakening of an ancient-one in Arkham Museum. Basically it's a dice-rolling game where you can see the requirements, rewards and penalties before you choose which adventure (card) to attempt.

This is a strictly better version of Arkham Horror for me. Feels like there is an actual game here. All the weapons and items actually make an impact on the game by either locking dice or adding dice. Does not take a million years to play like AH. The difficulty is a touch easy for my taste and can sometimes be a touch fiddley. But overall I would be willing to play this game over AH any time.

PROS:
Easy to learn/play.  Small footprint.  Forsaken Lore made the game more challenging with cool investigators, bless/cursed dice, and no more just buying ES from the store.

CONS:
Lots of dice chucking, so can feel too random (but can be mitigated with clues, items or skills).  Some characters are more useful than others because of asymmetric skill balance.  Theme isn't very strong though the expansion may change this.  

NOTES:
I have both expansions

As a dice game, it is ok.  

I am sorry, but if the Arkham Horror theme was not pasted on, people would give lot lower ratings.  Arkham Horror experience?  Not any more than Battleship Express is a naval simulation. 

Even a look at the top comments, things like:
..has some theme, but not that much..
..The flavor text was left to a minimum, with even the personal stories of the investigators gone..
..fun but fiddly..
..dice fest..
..game might be too easy..

As anyone who has played Arkham Horror/Eldritch Horror knows it takes a special game group to get these babies on the table, with a large # of components and pieces which can intimate new players and the time required can be a turn off.

Elder Signs proposes a solution to this issue and for the most part succeeds. At it's core Elder Signs is a Dice Rolling game, while it shares Theme, Art, Setting and overall feel with the rest of the Arkham File series the base game feels like a lighter game which works to both its benefit & detriment.

Pros: 
Short set up time.
Art/Theme is in line with the Cthulu charm from other Arkham titles (although flavour text is not as involved)
Faster play time, I can see this being an easier sell to most groups as it is all around the fastest in the series.
You get to roll dice which is fun.
Simple and easy to learn, far more streamlined then other Akrham File games
Simple Iconography

Cons:
THE DICE ARE HIDEOUS. In a dice game, I expect to have some decent dice. While Elder Signs dice seem well constructed their design & iconography fit the universe the dice themselves are bright vibrant primary colour green, yellow & red which frankly look awful next to the well designed cards, investigators and everything else.

Investigator Tokens are tiny and will get lost. Also they are hard to see. Honestly, I am likely going to use my Arkham/Eldritch investigators in future play throughs.

Some of the theme/variability is lost in the smaller box. There are very few items/spells in the base game (getting an expansion greatly aids this issue) and most of their abilities are similar to one another. 

All in all Elder Signs is a much more Task Focused game in the series, but its faster set up & play time makes it a great intro game to the Arkham Files and one you will likely play more often. 

But please someone, for the love of god, make some custom dice for this (I am working on it, but my design skills are terrible).

RATING: 5.5
This is pretty fiddly â there are some extremely small counters and the monster tokens are too tiny to really convey what they're about. In fact, I don't think the game succeeds in conveying much flavour at all. It's got a horror theme but you're never likely to get a hint of dread. Everything is focused on the game mechanics, which are perfectly fine if not very original. You weigh-up the rolls needed to tackle a task, factor in any cards you possess that could influence your chances, consider whether the potential rewards are worth the potential penalties and then either go ahead or back down. I'm not saying it's dull, but it's only as exciting as an abstract dice game.

RATING: 3
The optimal move for me happened to be:  stay in the same location & roll until you succeed.  So I did that unsuccessfully for a full hour in a 6p game until it mercifully ended.  Traded my copy as fast as I could.

Very nice production. It has the feel of Arkham horror in a nutshell without being stupid. My biggest complaint is that it should be designed so all players have something to do simultaneously, to avoid downtime with 6 or more players. Another complaint is that I wished for more abilities on the items.
Pretty nice mechanics overall! wouldn't mind if the dice rolling was a bit more complex. A more modern, up to date Arkham horror with less fiddling.

Since it is clear now Arkham Horrow will hardly ever get to the table AND Elder Sign is basically Arkham Horror the dice game (Especially the gates of arkham expansion)  I Enjoy how relaxed the based game is, and the difficulty is really ramped up in Gates of Arkham and Omens of ice.  Fun game overall and doesn't take 6 hours to get an arkham horror fix.... (you could make a movie out of about every game of this too)

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This may be the first FFG game in which the components haven't impressed me. The artwork and tokens seem standard for today's component quality in many games. The gameplay uses a Yahtzee mechanism in order to overcome objective cards. Overall, I find that this game has fewer decisions during a player turn than most other games with similar mechanisms. My first experience was fairly forgettable and I'm not in any rush to experience it again.

This is one of the first few board games I bought for myself. I picked it up after seeing it played on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show.

I have notoriously terrible dice luck and it can make for very frustrating games.

FAVORITE MEDIUM WEIGHT COOPERATIVE GAME RUNNER-UP

1-8 Players (Best: 4) / 90 Min / Weight: 2.35
Type: Thematic / Co-op / Solo

Expansions Owned:

Elder Sign: Unseen Forces
Elder Sign: Gates of Arkham

Rating is based on Base + Unseen Forces Expansion.

I've played Elder Sign: Omen a lot before I got physical version of the game. Since I got the physical version, I've played solo once so far (using Unseen Forces expansion). I like it as much as I like Elder Sign: Omen.

At first this game looked like just a dicefest luck based game, and I thought this is impossible to win without being extremely lucky. However, after a few play and reading some strategy advice, I found that this is all about luck management. It is very important to utilize all the resources - items and special abilities - to manage the luck.

I used to dislike push-your-luck games, but after playing this, I started liking push-your-luck mechanic based on dice rolling. I still don't like push-your-luck games based on card much.

I am so expecting to get Gate of Arkham expansion.

The computer version is VERY difficult really, even too hard.

Dice game that's perfect when you need an Arkham horror fix but don't have the time or the table space.
Feels a bit like Arkham lite, which is a good and a bad thing (good : same settings, characters and overall feel. bad :  doesn't come close to reaching the character depth and storytelling of AH).
Still, a good push your luck dice game with meaningfull decisions.
Great for solo play.

Traded away since it wasn't getting to the table as much compared to some other games filling the same areas. 

I found Pandemic: The Cure to be a more engaging dice chucking co-op that appealed to me more.
Betrayal at House on the Hill was more of a go to for that same thematic feel.

This was one of my first Cthulhu mythos games. Please understand that the game is a very light dice game where you are attempting to gain resources through rolling dice and defeating different monsters or uncovering clues. The game is fun. However, replayability might be an issue.

Arkham Horror express! That's what this is. They attempted to distil all the theme and awesomeness of Arkham Horror into a simple dice matching mechanic. Naturally a lot of the theme got lost and therefore it certainly won't replace Arkham in my house. But the pro's of this game are also substantial. The quick setup time and much shorter playing time will mean it hits the table more. It also means this, as opposed to AH, is actually a viable solo game. Components are great and the rulebook is not as horrible as an average FF rulebook. Enough of the theme remains and the game is meaty enough for me to like it as a quick solo game.

Decent enough game.  I think it really comes down to playing up the theme as much as possible. 

It can be easy to fall into the mode of looking at what "symbols" you need and rolling to get them, which is when this game is at it's worst and doesn't seem like a very compelling game.  

It really helps to play this with a few people who like to come-up with "logical" reasons, for example, for the likes of Harrigan to be running around on the ledge of a building (adventure description) which he uses a bullwhip (add the yellow die) to succeed, which spins off into "Oh it's just Harrigan, he's just a mashup of Homer Simpson and your favorite anti-hero."

All in all, a game who's appeal can fluctuate especially wide depending on the groups willingness try to come up with reasons for their characters to be doing such off-the-wall things to combat the awakening of the elder god.

Pretty and very nice theme.

This game perfectly captures what a battle with Cthulu would probably be like. You roll dice hoping for an impossible combination of symbols that will never come as you slowly lose your sanity. On the bright side, of the Cthulu games out this is the one that requires the least amount of time. Should you wish to bang your head against a wall for a longer period see Arkham Horror, Mansions of Madness, or Eldritch Horror.

This is a very light take on Arkham Horror.  I say this having never played the parent game this one came from, but it's small... very, very small.  The chits and tokens are just tiny, as are most of the cards.    I've played this several times now and still enjoy it.  Might feel too light if you are an AH fan, but works just fine for me.

Edit 10/22/11: Played with my oldest today and she loves it!  Glad this was a hit with her.  The first game was won fairly easily, but the second came down to the wire.  The ancient one awoke and we barely knocked it out before burning through our last two investigators.  Awesome!

One play and it has great theme.  However, it seemed way too easy... though we may not have had all of the rules right.  We started with 12 cards out instead of 6 which definitely made it easier (we dropped down to 6 cards when we realized our mistake).  Mostly, this is just not my style of game... rolling dice every turn to meet certain requirements.  Glad I had the chance to try it.

I think to get the most out of this game, you gotta be with a group that is into roleplay. It really brings the theme out. The game will come to life that way, otherwise, you're just rolling dice to move tokens around because the game just by itself isn't really oozing with theme. It's up to your group. I see this as a roleplaying experience more than anything else. I would totally recommend this if your group is into roleplaying, otherwise it may seem dry.

This is a lovecraftian dice chucking co-op. Fairly easy to teach and has an entertaing level of challenge and suspension. It is a little bit lucky as far as coops go, and slows to a crawl with more than four people, but with 2 or 3 people, it's very fun.

It's cooperative but players almost never interact with each other on the board. Whenever I was rolling dice I enjoyed it, but there's no planning or anything to do when it's not your turn so it's a bit boring.

RATING: 6
Elder Sign is a disappointing dice roller: it feels and plays like an overgrown filler with a trendy Cthulhu theme simply attached to.

Not only the downtime is too long here but the game also offers very little to do between turns apart from watching the others roll their dice and fail their rolls: since the sense of impotence and impending defeat is the same, Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness are two much better and gratifying alternatives.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is very well designed.  Scales well as the mechanics never change as the number of players change.  The only question I have is replayability?  Is the game deep enough to survive many plays.  Very good Co-op that really anyone can play, not just hard core gamers

I'm happy to have tried it.  I like co-op games as well as dice games, and that part was OK for me.  I didn't like this Fantasy Flight "dozens of tiny cards with tiny text that break rules in tiny ways" style of game, but I've played worse games in that style than this.

In my one play with five players, downtime was killer even with the owner sitting out so he could teach and keep the game moving.  In that sense it's like its big brother, I suppose.  The play was not engaging enough to make up for it.  I would probably only every play this game again with three people.  But, I'm also fine if I never play it again.  

The dice-off at the end was just ridiculous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Finally got to play this. It played smoothly enough, and I enjoyed the dice rolling and all the bits (as usually for an FFG title). I don't think it has the tension of Arkham Horror - there are no roaming monsters and no frantic closing of gates. There are some tough decisions, but I just felt the game didn't really justify its length and a little more character interaction would have been nice.

// Originally, I was drawn to this by the theme and the 
relatively simple mechanics, but having played so many
other games by now, the dice rolling seems too simple and
luck-based. I remember one play where my character was out
of the game and my wife spent a good ten minutes rolling
dice trying to defeat the ancient one. She was eventually
successful, but rolling dice over and over in that manner
just wasn't... fun. Wasn't fun to watch either. That said,
this game is OK when the mood is right, but there are tons
of better dice-based games out there.

Another "lite" version of Arkham Horror, but compared to Witch of Salem, this game does a better job of capturing the feel and tension of the FFG's Arkham Horror board game.  More luck than I like, and I'm souring on games that are fully co-operative (vs. semi-co-operative), but it's a pretty good game overall.  I really miss the "trapped by monsters" aspect of regular A.H., and although you have decks for common items, unique items, spells, and allies, the items have little character (read: they are bland/dull) because they just give you dice or hold your dice compared to the wacky types of items/spells in A.H.

RATING: 7
I'm rating this only as a solo game. I don't see enough interesting decisions to promote discussion with more than one. Perhaps it might be nice for two.

Elder Sign is a strange bird. It's a nice, elegant litle game, a fact which is a bit incongruent with it's theme of cosmic awfulness. Oddly, the theme seems to carry it, though. This, too (!) is strange as I'll give the game credit for generating theme during a solo session, which is not easy for a solitaire game to do.

Ultimately, I can't rate this above a seven because almost always the right move becomes apparent after a moment's thought. There is some risk/reward with the dice for taking longshots, but there really seems to be a basement of mechanical depth. It is both easy to win and, more to the point, easy to know how to win. I do think I'll find myself playing and looking forward to playing it when I'm in the mood for a light solo game. I just can't rate it high enough to stand with Space Hulk or other games which pack more into the experience.

I enjoy Elder Sign, but damn can it be brutal! Like, really brutal! Not that that's unexpected from a Cthulhu game, but the dice rolling is strong with this one, and has at times been frustrating enough I haven't wanted to play it. Usually seems to go swimmingly well, or disastrously badly, never in between. All in all, a good game, but with a lot of luck in it, so not something I'd want to play constantly!

I was expecting Arkham Horror express ... what I saw wasn't quite that :(

Monsters appear, challenges appear, you can sometimes get a gate, there's a GOO to defeat. So it all sounded good, you get a unique character with mind and health, and items, spells.

But when playing a big chunk of the flavour is lost, there is no real sense of narrative for me - and the decisions are rather trivial, I certainly didn't feel I was exploring, avoiding monsters, fighting monsters in a thankless role trying to beat back the nameless dread. Probably my hopes and expectations were unrealistic.

If this played in 20 minutes it would be fine, but it takes about an hour, and the process of streamlining this far has removed the flavour leaving a yahtzee variant that takes an hour, I'd have prefered they went further and made the game quicker. 

But I love the setting, so I could put up with that adding the flavour by reading out loud the diary text etc, but it's far too easy - first game with none of us sure what we were doing we got the required elder signs in about 6 'days' - with no deaths. All rather disapointing.

Production is top notch, reused art from the the CCG/LCG, cool dice - but game left me stone cold and running screaming, for all the wrong reasons.

The board game is a better game than the iOS game that repeatedly kicks my butt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite the wonky rules this is a fun game.  It's really just another take on the Yahtzee roll and re-roll mechanic but with some interesting implementations of that mechanic on top of a solid theme.  The theme can be totally ignored but I feel you will enjoy the game more if you let yourself get immersed in the world it is trying to create.

In the end this game is quite simple once you understand it and it has lots of dice rolling.  These traits make it a hit with my wife.  That fact alone gives it a boost up to a 9 for me.  We'll see how it holds up to repeated plays.

Edited 12-12-2011:  After more plays the sameness factor is creeping in.  Also, winning is almost a foregone conclusion and this makes the game much less enjoyable.  It's harder to pull it off the shelf when you pretty much know what the outcome is going to be.  Dropped to a 7.

I love the idea of this, but the game itself can sometimes really stomp all over you.  It's probably the most Lovecraftian of all the Cthulu games, just because of how hopeless it can make you feel.

Does a fairly good job of distilling Arkham Horror into a dice game.  The problem is there is really no tension, no story, and no sense of doom.  Just the Arkham theme with a bit of Yahtzee thrown in.  Also, the game is a tad too easy to make it really exciting.

It's cheap enough to make it a worthy impulse purchase, and it does scratch that Arkham Horror itch in a lot less time.  Don't go in with high expectations, I think you'll be disappointed.

A bit fiddly with all the cards/tokens, but a very thematic Yatzhee game.  Doesn't suffer as much from co-op alpha gamers as something with action points, but could still have people giving orders based on character powers.  Great production values (FFG) but having the app removes a lot of the need for owning a tabletop version of this game.  DEFINITELY needs a playmat and/or a plano box or custom insert to help setup/takedown times, because there's a lot of stuff in this smaller box, and it will intimidate newer gamers.

10x10 2014. I guess I'm a sucker for FFG's Lovecraft games.  This feels somewhat similar to Arkham and Eldritch but it has a place in my collection all the same.  As a dice game and as a co-op I think it's really good.  Maybe the second best dice game I've played to King of Tokyo.  Great sense of tension and while there isn't as much immersion as in the other games there still is a lot of Cthulhu flavor here. (tastes like squid)

lack of feelings. only with some effort you can feel like arkham horror. the most of the play you're a simple dice-thrower. uprated to 6 or 7 if played with house rules (movement, basement, new rules for flavouring the old ones, &c.)

RATING: 8
2017 Big fan of the Arkham Files games, and Richard Launius' approach to the mythos. The themed, iconic approach to adventure cards bring enough flavor to the game to avoid it just feeling like Yahtzee for me. Despite some game balance flaws (Mythos deck too easy, too-hard adventures balanced by easy access to extra dice/rerolls through the Entrance options) I have a great time every time I play.

Enjoy this very much solo.  Basically lots and lots of dice rolling, but it's not like you don't know that when you get the game.  Themes is decent, but nothing like the atmospheric world of Arkham Horror.  A keeper, but not so much for the group=play, more for the solo aspect.

Quoted from forums:


Variant to try:

"It's very simple to implement, and makes for challenging games.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following components are used


Components from Gates of Arkham: 

The Streets of Arkham Entrance sheet
Event cards
gate tokens
seal tokens
Skill cards(combined with those from Omens of the Deep, if you own that expansion)

Components from base game+Unseen Forces
----------------------------------------
All Adventure cards from base+Unseen Forces
combined Mythos deck from base game+Unseen Forces
The Lost&Found Entrance card

*The other Entrance cards from Unseen Forces are not used

Setup:

1)Remove the following 5 cards from the Mythos deck. 

Fresh Start...Or Needed Aid
Hopeless...Or Doomed
Lost...Or Found
Unarmed...Or Unsafe
The Way Closes...Or Darkness Descends
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
2)Adventure cards are placed faceup as per the usual rules.


3)Other World Cards enter play facedown, and whenever an Other World card is drawn, a gate appears, as per the rules in Gates of Arkham.

*An Other World card will only be placed faceup if it entered play as a result of a beneficial card (such as Gate Box or Find Gate). 


4)Put the Streets of Arkham Entrance sheet in play, and place your investigators on it. 


5)In the beginning of the game, place an Event card facedown at random on two of the six starting adventures.

6) Whenever a doom token is added to the regular non-gate/non-monster space on the doom track, place a facedown Event card on any Museum adventure at random that doesn't already have one.

7)
There can never be more than 3 Event cards in play on Museum Adventures 

8) If you've failed or didn't complete a Museum Adventure with an Event card on it(after revealing the Event card), replace the Event card with a different one, until the Adventure has been resolved and/or replaced. 

9)
If you've used the Entrance sheet's ability to replace a Museum Adventure with A Midnight effect , add a doom token to the doom track.

10)When using common or unique items that add dice,you must commit to adding the yellow or red die to your dice pool before starting your resolution phase. 
[/b]

11)
Once per turn, whenever you use the yellow or red die for the completion of a task, if you roll the "4 investigation" or "wildcard" results, respectively, you may immediately take a free trip to the Lost&Found without risk of losing stamina/sanity.
The roll must be natural , and cannot be augmented or manipulated by any items or special abilities
Roll 3 green dice to see what you get. If you roll investigation results, you lose nothing. 

After resolving this, carry on with the completion of your task, as if your turn hasn't been interrupted. 
You may not use the Lost &Found in any other way, other than the one outlined above.

12)
Membership cards are not used, and any cards that denote them are discarded without effect. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've been playing with this variant a lot to get extra mileage out of the base set, and it's very fun."

Only played once. Cthulhu themed co-op where you're competing to collect thing A (Elder Signs) before you get too many of thing B (doom tokens). It was the first of many dice rolling games I played that day, and I found it pretty slow and un-engaging, despite the theme. Far preferred the much quicker Las Vegas.

This comment is based on one solo play. Actually I am quite amazed how intense I think it got. Though your fate heavily depends on dice rolls, there are still some stragedy involved. The atmosphere is found in the pictures on the difference cards and the little bit of text on the adventure cards.

When it is called "Arkham Horror ultra light", I must say that I agree.

Elder Sign is a lot of fun - it's basically a fairly simple push-your-luck dice game that plays great solo.  It has the flavor of Arkham Horror with a much shorter playing time.  As much as I enjoyed the game, though, its downfall was simplicity.  While Arkham Horror can be very tough with 1 or 2, Elder Sign is too easy!  Even as a solo game, I managed to win 80% of the time, and with 2 or more it seems like a no-brainer.  Sadly, until they manage to ramp up the difficulty on this one, it has hit the sale pile.

Dice rolling made simple and frustrating while never feeling particularly boring, Elder Sign is a nice way to get people into gaming and is still fun when you're already there. Sometimes you just get hosed and sometimes you just waltz through the game, but it's still good.

I really like this thematic, evocative dice game. After a few plays, I actually think it is a little too easy, but maybe I haven't been playing with the right Ancient Ones.

Good game that takes the cthulu mythos and turns it into a dice game.  It plays pretty well, I have enjoyed it qutie a bit.  The players are not balanced, at least from the experiences that I have had with it.  Some make for a much easier game than others.  The people I have set down with to play this have had fun with it, and are willing to try it again in the future.  It makes for some interesting odds management by using the dice to determine success at tasks.

The group that I game with have affectionately referred to Elder Sign as "Arkham Horror Yahtzee."  This is probably as accurate of a description as you are going to get.  Despite the heavy variables involved during each player's turn, the game does not feel nearly as challenging as anything else in FFG's "Arkham Horror" series.  Still, for the price, it's definitely worth the purchase, and makes for a great game to introduce newbies into the series.

This game is ok when played on the computer, but in person it takes way too long. All the little fiddly upkeep components of the game take up more time than the actual play time. My guess it's at least four times longer in person than it is on computer. To add to it, it's way too easy, my decisions feel meaningless because it seems that right decision wrong decision, I'm going to win no matter what.

2 plays. Adventure-horror Yahtzee. I like rolling dice, talking shit and hoping for the right rolls. I like adventures and killing zombies. It's even sorta kinda a smidge thematic. Grafting an adventure boardgame onto a Yahtzee engine is actually a really clever idea. Badass!

Very fun Arkham/Eldritch Horror Lite game. Gives you the flavour of those games without the cost or lengthy setup/play times. (Not for the serious gamers, probably).

The game gives many ways to mitigate lousy dice rolls, but there will be several times when - no matter what you do - you just cannot get what you need to complete an adventure.

Still, a great solo/co-op game IF you like the Yahtzee-style game play.

Multiplayer Yahtzee. I don't really see the wide appeal of this game, except for people who like to roll dice. There is virtually no strategy as all your actions depend on the luck of the dice rolls.

RATING: 5.5
I was positively surprised by this game. Having tried Eldritch Horror, Betrayal at House on the Hill and other games in that vein, I had low expectations coming into this game. However, it wasnât as bad a game as I had thought. Sure, there is a LOT of dice rolling, and if you roll poorly you will lose the game no matter how well you play. Normally, Iâm not a fan of this, but I think I didnât mind too much because this is a cooperative game, so bad rolls affected the entire group instead of an individual. Also, the game is relatively short (we finished our games in about 50 and 40 minutes), and thatâs a big plus for me. Eldritch Horror, based on the same theme, has a lower rating because it takes forever to play. 

Still, my rating of 5 reflects my opinion about the game; itâs an okay game, and I could play it once in a while, but I wouldnât actively suggest it myself. If looking for a coop taking a little less than an hour, I would pick some other game (even if it ran a little longer). The gameplay simply feels too limited; you pick a monster to fight and hope you get those symbols when rolling and re-rolling. I did like how you could buy and get equipment once youâve slain some monsters, but it felt a little weird that you could buy the necessary victory points. In my two games, we were never in any big trouble, so the ancient one never woke up (i.e. we won prematurely). I donât like my coops too easy, so it will probably take a while before I play ES again.

This game gets a 1 for playtesting because each of the games I've played have been a TOTAL cakewalk.  The reason I didn't give it 1 is because, underlying the game are fun mechanisms and items and such.  The problem is that there's almost no way for the doom track on the GOOs to fill up, certainly not with the mythos deck.  The mythos deck usually gives you an "out" for the doom token that is simple to take.  What an incredible shame.  This could have been awesome.

Update: I've begun playing with the following variants: each time you fail to complete a task, you take the penalty, even if dropping a die to re-roll; and share out monsters evenly (no piling on one poor card).  The game is now much harder, with much more interesting decisions.  Once I've tried it this way enough, I might change my rating.

A bit put off by reports of typos, but a mythos game you can play in less than 5 hours?  Win!

Win?!  Yes, we certainly won.  Now that I've played I can add my voice to the other slightly-energetic meh's being uttered.  Although the game moves quickly enough and is usually fun, there's very limited strategy.  Do-nothing turns are frequent, and while they don't take too long it's sort of a bore to accomplish nothing in a turn.  Although bad stuff continued to happen, I never felt we were on the verge of defeat, although it was exciting when an excellent die roll brought us victory.

As an aside the lack of permanent equipment really detracts, for me, from the involvement I feel in building the character up.  Although the special abilities are nice, I had very little feeling of it being "my" character.

Overall I'd play it again, and enjoy it.  It doesn't suffer from the time issues that other mythos games do, but it doesn't really shine either.

Accidentally house ruled the Doom Token at midnight variant from the start.  Can't see how you could lose otherwise.  Theme is largely a thin veneer over the game, although, Elder Sign retains that sense of dread as the number of Elder Signs falls behind the number of Doom Tokens.  Like Arkham Horror, could benefit from more teamwork actions.

It does get more to the table more of late than the other FFG Lovecraft games as it is much faster to setup and easier to teach.

Needs some rules clarification right out of the box. It's an overall fun experience - but a little too easy. 

A lot of the mechanics are derived from Arkham Horror, easy to draw parallels, but different enough to make it it's own experience. Just enough flavor text to get a small story going too. 

Looking forward to an expansion that adds more variety, a bit more difficulty and maybe another small set of mechanics, but wouldn't want it too get too much more complicated than it already is. Keep it lite!

A lighter dice game set in the Arkham universe.  It's fun trying to conquer challenges - and the game can be played to completion in under an hour.  But it isn't very deep, and certainly shares more with Yahtzee than with Arkham Horror.

The other issue is that the win percentage has been very high.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but so far it seems like the good guys have it fairly easy.  Have looked at FAQs, etc, but it looks like we're playing correctly.  Will probably look at house rules for maybe upping the challenge a little.  Or, I'm sure FFG will release an expansion at some point that will probably do that as well.

I like this game. It is a bit too long, in my opinion, but I love the fact that people can come and go during the game; we need more games like that. I hold a game night at my house, and people all come at different times. This is a great game to start with as people can just join in when they get there.

Far too easy. I have played maybe 7 times and have never lost. The only time I came close was when I had 8 people playing (the more people you have playing, the more spread out the trophies and items are, which makes the game harder). I would recommend playing with 5 or more players, but then the downtime gets a little long.

Anyway, it's fun, my family isn't a huge fan, though, but my friends like it.

At the end of the day, as neat as Elder Sign is, it really just makes me want to play anything else from the Fantasy Flight Lovecraft franchise: Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror or Mansions of Madness. Even their card game Call of Cthluhu seems to hold more appeal to me. It's not that Elder Sign is bad, it just sort of awakens my appetite more than it settles it. There's very little flavor text here, which works better for King of Tokyo than a thematic game.

Lavishly produced dice chucking fest. Scratches both the Arkham Horror and solitaire itch. A bit fiddly, and as usual with FFG, there are interactions between cards that require the odd on-the-fly ruling, but otherwise a great game. With Gates of Arkham and the thematic expansions that came after, this becomes even fiddlier, quite complex, but also a tremendous experience. Easily one of the best FFG games, and easily the best meatier dice chucker around. A personal favorite.

Elder Sign on its own:
The base game is fun a but little easy for a solo/co-operative game.  It is still possible with the locked dice mechanism and a lot monsters appearing to go from a winning path to loosing.  However the tension generated in the Arkham Horror game can be absent as you pick your way through the locations faster than the doom track can escalate.  In fact I could not recommend playing this game without the expansion it may spoil your enjoyment.

The Expansion Unseen Forces:
This expansion makes all the difference it resets the difficulty just a little higher, even if you win its does not look like a fore gone conclusion. 

Variety and difficulty win win.

Elder Sign with the Expansion:
Arkham Yatzee is the most reductive way of looking at this game.  Although this is in part quite true, this game is not Roll Through the Ages which really does feel like a unashamed re-theme of Yatzee.

Tactically this game is a series of linked Yatzee like rounds used to resolve events.  This has its appeal but it is the decisions around when and how resources should be used (spells, items, character powers, clues etc) where to go next what should be made a priority (elder signs, blessings, midnight events, resource gathering etc) that makes this game only a distant relative of Yatzee.

The selection of a srategy is core and the most significant gameplay DNA it shares with Arkham Horror.  Without this the family resembalance would largely be artwork and theme.  Tactically a intuitive or mathimatical understanding of dice rolling probabilites will be required to make the best decissions. When you a rolling muliple dice at least a command of probability can be used to manage uncertainty.  I would go as far as saying that playing this game well requires the undestanding of probability in the way that Power Grid makes demands on your mental arithmatic (command of uncertainty can be demanding as certainty).

By the end of long game you will have estimated your chances picked 6 green dice and rolled a lot.  I think that Elder Sign can outstay its welcome and the simple core mechanic repeated endlessly can be an issue.

Arkham Horror Comparison:
My biggest criticisms of Arkham Horror is slow pace which means that a plan that takes minutes to devise can end up taking hours to implement and the slow death by a thousand cuts (the game can take a long time (sometimes hours) to go from a clear losing position to game completion.  

Arkham Horror still lingers in the memory like no other boardgame, a year later you can remember a close game, characters that played well and events that spun the game around.  Variety and randomness is everything, even the enjoyability of the game can be down to cards and dice.  If only the game could detect your loosing position and finish you off quickly.

Elder Signs suffers from the same issues but on a much smaller scale.  Plan to implementation, significantly quicker but still slow.  Losing or winning position to game end very variable and potentially slow.  Elder Sign suffers from the same weaknesses and its sister game but scaled down.

The player avatars feel less well defined and many of the items simply add one dice even if the artwork and name are different.  The Yatzee resolution and the less well defined characters and items can take you out of the game world and make it the game feel a little abstract at times.

Conclusion:
This is a worthwhile if not brilliant re-implementation of the Arkham Horror paradigm.  It shares many of Arkham Horrors faults on a smaller scale and the strengths  also feel sightly watered down.  Arkham Lite just seems to fit the bill.

FFG are having yet another go at an Arkham game.  I can only hope that it has the same strenghts as its predecessors scaled up and they manage to water down the weaknesses.  Until then I will keep on watching the sky.

Arkham Yahtzee? Yes and no.  I like it.  At first I thought it might be too easy, but then I realized we were playing a couple rules wrong and that made a big difference.  Not quite as fun as Arkham Horror, but perhaps a bit more forgiving... only just a bit.

An OK game, but not excellent. Push your luck mechanics is too much randomness. Especially when some adventure require at least 5-6 dice to complete (you have only 6 dice to start with)

also, the game can get really frustrating at times, you just dont roll the symbols you need after using 3 clues and red yellow dice.

Great dice and cooperative game (also solo). Even with the luck of the dice, there are enough decisions and ways to mitigate the luck so that you have lots of control. Good decisions will give you a better chance to win. Once you get the hang of the game, it goes pretty quick. Theme works great and there is enough to really make it more than just a dice chucker.

Condenses the essence of some of the other Mythos games into a nice little dice game, but I find it really hard to get buy-in on the theme/story with most of the people I play with. A lot of gamers won't necessarily get the connection between "you need to find clues for this task" and "roll a bunch of magnifying glasses" or "this task is physically dangerous" and rolling skulls.

Cute little game that is reminiscent of Arkham Horror (which can't be said the other way 'round). Fun as a filler dice-chucker, though an expansion that ramps up the difficulty (to say, Arkham-Horror-Angst-Level) would be much appreciated. The most sensible 'fix' for single-player sessions seems to be disallowing the 'respawn'-mechanic, forcing yourself to beat the game with just the single investigator at hand. This also makes for a more interesting 'story', if you're into that at all, one of the most appealing assets of Arkham Horror that did not make the transition to Elder Sign.

Elder Sign: A family friendly introduction to the Mythos. 

A very luck based game that tends towards being far too easy, but it's quick, intuitive, and cooperative. It's a brilliant game to play while socialising with the other players. For this reason, I rate it very highly. 

I tend towards doing events in the worst possible way to increase the difficulty somewhat when playing it with an experienced group. Can't wait for the Unseen Forces expansion, which should introduce many ways to increase the difficulty.

Traded this, not sure you could call it a game. This is a very overrated game. Up to the standard of FFG, card typos, which take away from the game, rules unclear, example when do you play a spell, 6 months for a FAQ from FFG, has very little cooperative play. Basically you collect items, which you can't trade, these basically just allow you to freeze die, or small die change, you pick a adventure card and you roll until you win or lose, lose you take a hit, adventure card may get harder via of adding a monster. Cooperative play is if another investigator failed the card first, is still sitting on it, you can freeze a die on him, they called it focus. This is just Yahtzee with some cards for ever increase goals for the dice to meet. It is clear FFG didn't proofread the text on the cards before printing and given the rules, didn't bother to test play with a fresh group of players with the final draft of the rule book. Just read the rule forum posts before that 6 months FAQ came out. Only the Lovecraft, FFG and the Arkham Horror fanboys must keep this game's rating up. You can't get pass that you just reading off some probability off a card and rolling dices to win or lose, over and over, losing one or more die each roll, feels like playing craps with variable probability. The choices seem pretty transparent. Why is this fun? It feels more like a chore playing. As for cards adding theme, why, or why, do they print in fonts that are hard to read? It adds nothing to the games as the theme is oil on water. At the price of Forbidden Island this game might be worth picking up, I wouldn't. At the $30 I paid this wasn't worth it, the card typos which changed play, the poor rule book, with the FAQ, corrected info for the cards, it is playable, still not fun, and these things just adds insult to injury. I will think long and hard before buying another FFG game when it first comes out, or at all. The other game publishers just seem to put more of an effort into their products, they are quicker on a FAQ, I have seen some publishers answer questions, not so FFG, they just let you house rule it, until they get to a FAQ. It looks like FGG just phoned in Elder Sign. If you purchased this early, without the idevice app, anyone remember the question of when a spell could be used, game vs app, and 6 month in the making FAQ helping you out, this game wasn't a gaming experience as much as it was an experiment. Using early buyers to sort out your rule book isn't my idea of a good business model. This is what fresh test players are for. 

The only horror in this game is the production, rule book, game play, created it would seem via of  FGG's we phoned it in test play, which produced game playing card typos and a rule book that is only of value if you know the rules. That or they just don't care. If you turned this in as a high school project I would question if it would even get a D just based on the production. Will be glad when this one fades away.

Interesting reading comments at the 7 rating. Why do people have short reviews, like "boring watching other people roll", "lots of down time", "dice fest", "yahtzee", "after 3 or 4 games, not hitting the table, boring" and rate it a 7? Do they know what a 7 means?

Learning to take ratings numbers with a grain of salt.

RATING: 8.75
What's not to love? This is a slimmed down version of one of my favorite games (Arkham Horror) but it plays in less than half the time. There are a lot less stats to keep track of, and visually the challenges are clear even to the novice player.

I also appreciate that you keep the classic characters, each bringing a special ability which is often critical to your success. With the different big villains to fight, you have the opportunity to scale it up to the difficulty level your group prefers.  And you can play this solo.

Honestly the only real drawbacks are that the luck element is very high because it's all dice-based, and there are a relatively limited number of challenge cards.  Fortunately this is ripe for expansions.  While I still love AH, I expect will play Elder Sign far more often.

-FOCUS: Only Focus if it is a failed roll. One dice must be removed for failed before a Focus.


I enjoy both games because they differ enough to have both in my collection. The digital does not have allies and you can only play 4 investigators instead of 8. The digital has some really neat scenario driven adventures that offer new game play mechanics. The digital does not have an end game battle with the ancient one if you don't collect enough elder signs.

The 'Arkham Horror' dice game!  Short play time is a plus too.

RATING: 6.5
Like Arkham Horror without the narrative on the cards and all the book-keeping, only instead of losing all the time, you win all the time.  I mean you have to literally lose all the dice before playing to lose this.  But it's quite nice to get out here and there and just chuck some dice about and pretend you may lose.  And then win.

 Cthulhu dice saves the world! Or not?

 Arkham Horr... ehm, cooperative Arkham Yathzee, but not quite. Theme is strong, atmosphere also and itÂ´s such a fun to roll dice in attempt to save the world. Big win of this game is, that (luckily) you are not dependent just on pure luck, because you have possibilies (through cards with represent allies, magic or equipment) how to work with each (ehm, most) dice rolls. ItÂ´s much more fun than it seems on the start. And despite light horror theme, itÂ´s perfectly suitable as a great family game (with older children), which is not a euro trash nor a american trash.

 Component value is high, but not top notch (I can imagine better dice; they are quality enough, but feels light to me and not much suitable to theme). Rules are simple, but there is classic FFG "grey zone" in them, when particualy situations can be interpreted in more ways and rules doesnÂ´t give you a straight answer "how you suppose to play it".

 Only one bigger flaw is difficulty, which is too low on cooperative game and even too low for casual gamers. On the other side, system is so well conceived an open to tinker, that you have tons of possibilites to make your own house rules (or there are lots of very good variants) without changing a game core mechanism (much). Fhtagn!

Some people call this game Cthulhu Yahtzee, but I think it plays more like a light dungeon crawler. You've got health and sanity points, you've got spells and items to tip the scales in your favor, and you've got lots of dice to do battle with unspeakable horrors! With a thick Lovecraft theme and about a 90 minute playing time, what's not to love? It's a good price with quality bits, too.

This game is a huge hit with my kids and myself. We play it almost any chance we've got the time available.

Arkham Yahtzee, some have called this, and they are correct. There is a small amount of resource management, but at the end of the day you're rolling a bunch of dice and hoping they roll your way. As a solitaire/coop game the theme isn't enough (and is too thin anyway) to save this from hitting the trade pile. And I *like* Quarriors!

I really wanted to like this game. A quick game of Arkham, yes please. It just falls flat. There's not enough luck mitigation in the base game and the mechanics just aren't interesting enough to keep me. I'm told that expansion make it better, but I have to like the base game to invest in expansions. Knowing FFG, one day they'll come out with a new and improved version that costs $10.00 more and sucks less.

A game from the makers of Eldritch and Arkham Horror, Elder Sign is a dice matching game that makes it where you must match symbols on cards in hopes of getting enough Elder Signs to stop the Ancient One for the game from waking up and devouring the world. As a board game it's okay to play with people but I found that the Elder Sign game on android and iOS is just as, if not more, fun to play then the actual game. That does not mean that this isn't a good game to sit down and play with friends though.

Thematically very nicely crafted cooperative game, in which the players are investigators in the monster infested city of Arkham. A lot of different characters can be played, each with their own sanity and stamina level, and specific abilities. There are lots of different cards representing weapons, artifacts, spells, allies... Random events are taking place when entering specific locations, each 12 hours is played under specific circumstances, and on top of that a host of adventure cards are available all adding to the replayability of this dice driven game. If you don't like to be at the mercy of the dice gods, play another game, otherwise a great deal of tension and fun is guaranteed.

I didn't love this game at first -- the theme isn't entangled with the game play quite enough for my liking -- but now it's one of my favorites.  It's fairly easy to teach (unlike Arkham Horror), so it's not hard to get your friends and family to play it.

The base game itself is not that great. You really have to love Cthulu themed things because otherwise this isn't worth it. Surprisingly, there are a lot of ways to manipulate your dice results, but it doesn't always go your way. I was initially intrigued by its portability and reduced playing time, but realized I don't like that everything is so small. I can't imagine playing with more than 4 people. I feel the game is easier to beat with more than 4 people though. I wanted to like this game... but it fell short. This game definitely needs the expansions. Sticking to Eldritch Horror.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Think Cthulhu the cooperative game + King of Tokyo. A great next step game because it shares the dice mechanism. The push-your-luck is not so much in the dice like KoT but more in how you work together and decide who goes where and with what cards.

The setup is not too bad and it plays quicker than the other Cthulhu games from FFG so there's that, but you should only get this game if you like dice rolling and matching part of the game, which I do.

Decent amount of cooperation between players in combination with special character powers and reward cards.

Elder Sign is a very fun game that, despite relying on dice, isn't as dependent on luck as you may think. The only thing I found this game was lacking was a more team oriented playing style. In a less talkative group, usually the most experienced player takes over and tells everyone what to do.

Interesting in delivering the Lovecraft theme in a much shorter and more accessible format. The game leaves way too much in the hands of luck, without enough of a story experience to compensate. Most of the game you roll looking to match some symbols and are "horrified" when you don't see the symbols. Locations have some nice art but nothing else to let you know there is a theme involved.

The only thing giving this game a bump from the middle of mediocrity is the item cards that you can collect that let you bend the laws of probability. Figuring out when and the best way to use them provides some challenge. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Like this way better than Arkam horror. It's just easier to get a quick Lovecraft/solo game in. The art/ambiance is the same I think...I know others would disagree. It's just a preference for shorter games I guess

Good cooperative game with limited player interaction. The game could benefit from a turn guide to make sure that you check all conditions and effects and don't forget anything (mythos cards, adventure cards, and ancient one may have effects).

The game would benefit from more customization of the mythos cards and monsters based on the ancient one your are fighting besides the mask monsters.

The Box insert could use separate compartments for the large number of cards, dice, and tokens.

Ok...so, I play this game at least 4 times a week.  It sits on my table for easy access and it's quick fun.  it's easy to get someone walking by to play.  I also have the iPad version - which is also great.  The ipad version is a bit different but still very good.   This is one of those games that's so easy, quick, and accessible that it gets a lot of play time.  I would like to see more expansions and a few more things to do but it's great just as is.  It replaced Dominion as the quick go to game.  Love it!

For the type of game it is and the niche it fills - it's really a 10.  If you like the theme - it's a must have!

It's pretty.  I think the only reason, I spent so much time with it as a single player was I was hoping to salvage it through houserules.  The few times I was able to get an enthusiastic group to play, it fell completely flat to me and the rest of the players.  Rulebook is the worst I have ever seen, especially, considering this is supposed to be a quick pace and short game.  Way waaaaaay too many bits.  The location requirement for assist greatly limits player co-op that's already near non-existant. Should NEVER be played with more than 4 people, because between turns you have little to no reason to pay attention.

My go-to Ameritrash game.  The only Fantasy Flight Game I will consider buying expansions for.

Biggest Pro(s):  Nice art.  Compact size.  Good narrative.

Biggest Con(s):  Takes too long for what you get, which can be addressed via houserules, but this is complicated in expansions like Omens of Ice (and probably Omens of the Deep).

RATING: 9
What a game! Unbelievable how it captures the feel of Arkham Horror with a dice based mechanism. The base box is a bit on the easy side but the expansions scale up the difficulty level. All my games ( mostly solo)was tense and FUN. The lenght is perfect for a work day evening. The expansions make it even more interresting. The boring level is at zero, no downtime. I can't ask for more (except to find a decent way to pack all the stuff in a single  box!)

The original rules make this game too easy. I play with Mr Skeletor's house rules: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/720190/mr-skeletors-elder-sign-houserules

This makes the game what it should be: A real challenge to complete and the feeling that everything is going wrong at the worst times.

I enjoyed playing it once. It's a great feeling if you're able to successfully complete a card/mission, but too much is left to chance and the co-op element doesn't really help you win the game. I probably don't need to play it again.

I love that this game can play up to 8, as there aren't a lot of games  that can handle that many players. It still works equally well with less.  Now don't  mistake that to mean this game is easy to win. Oh no, far from it, but that's part of what I like about it. It requires a combination of luck,  cooperation and managing of tools to emerge victorious, but even when you lose, it's usually still a fun game. Besides, it isn't Lovecraft if the horrors don't usually win, right? 

There is one scary thing that happens though. When playing at the local game store, I usually have an employee blind pick the elder god we face. Every time the store manger has picked, we've faced Shub-Niggurath after he called it as he picked it each time.

Arkham Lite.  Cthulu Yahtzee.  Whatever clever name you have for it, it's pretty cool.  It plays much faster than Arkham, but all the familiar elements are still there. Kudos to FFG for an excellent effort at streamling a favorite game and making it better.

Still a great game, but I have grown uncomfortable with the horror/occult theme, so I traded it away for Innovation

This is a fun dice-rolling, Yahtzee-style game with some other interesting additions to vary play. There are enough different characters to play and challenges to take on that I like the variety. It is a challenging game in its own right. And yet I feel like it stays around too long and wears out its welcome. It is a well-done game, but it just doesn't play as well as I think it could for what it does.

This is a poor version of the press your luck dice genre, but it is also 10 times more complicated than your typical dice game.  The theme is horribly pasted on.  The decisions are convoluted and don't seem meaningful.  I cant imagine why people like this game.  I played it four times thinking I was missing something.  The rating is pretty high, so there are obviously people who like it, but for the life of me, I cant figure out why.  Perhaps they have a soft spot for the theme.

Note: I have only played the iPad version of the game... which has a very poor tutorial... and sometimes crashes. So perhaps that has tainted my experience a little.(but I don't think so).

Fun dice probability game.  Some people say there is too much luck, but there are enough choices in when and how to roll the dice that this is very overstated.

In fact, number of choices is a strength of the game as you must constantly analyze your odds and choose the dice strategy that gives the best chance of success at the end of the series of rolls.

That said, it has the usual coop game caveats: luck in terms of card/monster draw can make the game too easy or too hard and the actions you take to win tend toward the repetitive.

My first and most important thought was this is what LOTR LCG should be like. this game is so much fun. I can aquire gear, recruit allies, get spells,heal up, turn in points to get even more gear,  and not to mention each hero's ability is great.

There are no bad decisions to make only which of many usefull/good decisions to make to get the job done. now some would say this is too easy, but I would take none of that. I think (just my opinion) that this could be considerd easy as in 'I win every time'. However, I think the more correct way of looking at it is 'how can I get this won without taking longer to do it? 

maybe I can put that another way....this isn't pass/fail (where people want it a 20/80 to be considered difficult and challenging ala Dugeonquest). I think ES more a game of a grade: You either get it done quickly (given an A) or less so (B,C,D where the 'punishment' is a longer game to get it done) with the unlikly event of dying if your totaly unlucky and get that ill fated F grade.

The co-op is seemless, helpful, and fun to work together, the events are managable and not increasingly devasting with each passing turn (and no threat wheel).  I really enjoyed the game, and I know I loved it because all I wanted to do afterwards was play again.

I have never played Arkahm Horror, but after playing this I sure want to now.

Fun, atmospheric push your luck game of Elder horror. The basic mechanics are quite simple and fun and contribute greatly to the atmosphere (I've been cursed! THEY are trying to make us lose by not allowing us to roll correctly!) with some depth and interesting, if simple, decision making.
Played a lot of this on the iPad and it does feel quite different at a table with others. Some of the rules have been changed from one version to the other, but if you've played one, you know basically how to play the other.
Lots of material in the box which means that it can hit the table again and again without feeling too samey.

This is a fairly solid co-op that has a decent amount of replayability.

Some issues - while I enjoy the Lovecraft theme, it does make it harder to hit the table at family gatherings. Additionally, the mechanics and the theme don't align much, this is basically a more complex form of Yahtzee.

I still really enjoy the game, but there are other co-ops I lean on more heavily to scratch that itch.

A reimagining of Arkham Horror as a dice game.  Players complete adventures by rolling certain combinations of dice, receiving rewards such as weapons and spells.  Surprisingly deep and fun, it's basically Arkham in half the time and a quarter the table space.

A light game amongst all the heavy games with the Cthulu-mythos theme. Easy to learn and play and it can be played solo, wich isnÂ´t that common. ItÂ´s probably rated a little higher than it deserves, but itÂ´s a light, easy game with nice theme and I like it.

I wanted to love this, but despite all the enormous effort around giving this game "theme", it just felt like rolling dice to me.  The dice rolling mechanisms just aren't that exciting, and the card effects are meh.

D-Day Dice, on the other hand, has a much more interesting dice rolling system, co-op interactions, and card play.  D-Day Dice does this type of game right, and it killed ES for me.
 
I love Arkham Horror by the way.

Elder Sign is a cooperative game where the players work together to kill monsters.  On your turn, you can pick what you want to attack and can tailor your decision based upon your role (and special power that comes with it) and your special cards.  This game is challenging to win, but is doable.  You have one last chance to kill the main monster, but if you get to that point you are unlikely to win.  Players like the ability to chose what part of the mission they are going to go after.

I have tried to play the iPad version more times than I can count. It's extremely hard, and I can never seem to roll what I need to complete any investigations. I have heard that the physical version is easier/more fulfilling. I hope so, because the iPad version is darned near impossible for me, and every time I fire it up is an exercise in masochism.

Because of the limited interaction between players, this is better with fewer players. It's not bad as a solo game, and quite good with 2 or 3, but less fun with more.

With more players, the rate at which things change also makes any sort of planning from one turn to the next impossible, which is another mark against larger games.

A shorter more simplified version of Arkham Horror, this game does have, however, some complex dice rolling mechanics exceeding the complexity of anything you'll find in Arkham. I don't like that it confines players to a single building, though I've heard that the expansion is fabulous.

Lovecraft Yathzee and I love it. Sometimes extremely hard, other times a cakewalk, sometimes somewhere in the middle. It is a flavorful and fun dice rolling game with character. The theme and setting, it's window dressing but it makes the game appealing and gives you something more than just rolling pips. What's I find funny though is that I have Omens on my tablet and I kind of find it boring. Even though it is a much bigger pain the rear to setup and play with I'd rather sit with all the bits, cards and components in front of me. I guess I just feel more engaged and the tablet version just isn't as interesting to me.

Having never played Arkham Horror or Mansions of Madness, I will review this game based solely on its own merit, not a comparison as most people have done. That being said, I have seen AH and MoM played at conventions, and they seem really complex with lots of things to keep track of. This game, however, is pretty simple, perhaps too simple for some. This really is just Yatzee Chthulhu, thats a pretty good name for it. Luckily, I love Yatzee and I love H.P. Lovecraft, so this was an instant success in my house. What I really like about this game is that adults and kids can play it together and can both have fun for different reasons. The adults can pretend to be hunting monsters, while the kids can enjoy finally being able to play one of "Daddy's Games" without having to have their hand held the entire time.

Another thing I like about, is the rules can be tweeked. Having too much trouble, hand out some extra clues or spell cards. Too easy, add some extra doom tokens. There really is no reason to bash this game on the rules when you can easily change them and make the game better. My only gripe is the lack of diversity of your items. You get Spells, Unique Items, Common Items, and Allies, but they all basically allow you to do the same things. So, my question is, why bother with all the different kind of cards, why not just have an items pile, with all those mixed in, like Last Night on Earth?

Bottom line, enjoyable, but slightly flawed.

Una primera partida de trasnoche en solitario me dejÃ³ una buena sensaciÃ³n. No sÃ© si tuve suerte con las aventuras que fueron saliendo, si fue el investigador que me tocÃ³, si se tratÃ³ de una insÃ³lita buena fortuna con los dados o si, por el contrario (y esto es lo mÃ¡s probable), no apliquÃ© correctamente alguna regla o tal vez alguna importante la haya pasado por alto, pero lleguÃ© a sellar con sÃ­mbolos arcanos el portal del primigenio antes de que saliera de las entraÃ±as de la mesa.

Es verdad, es tirar dados y poco mÃ¡s, pero para mÃ­ sÃ­ que tiene ambientaciÃ³n y se genera tensiÃ³n con algunas aventuras. No soy para nada amante de los dados y sin embargo me la pasÃ© muy bien.

SÃ­ debo reconocer que me quedaron algunas dudas respecto del reglamento que el cuadernillo del juego no supo disipar. QuizÃ¡s allÃ­ estÃ© el quid de la cuestiÃ³n. Pero que lo disfrutÃ©, lo disfrutÃ©.

Edito: Nueva partida en solitario. No se me diÃ³ ni una tirada. En un abrir y cerrar de ojos estaba enfrentÃ¡ndome al primigenio con una mano delante y otra atrÃ¡s. Se me hizo muy difÃ­cil, a diferencia de la primera. Igual la disfrutÃ© mucho.

As is with FFG games, lots of fiddly bits packed into the box. But after one play, it goes rather smoothly. 90% through and you're thinking this is too easy but the monsters  and the doom counters have been adding up, and suddenly you have the "oh s**t" moment. Nice variety of Investigators and Ancient Ones for replay. Theme is okay. Could see this going up or down a point with more plays.

Finally a FFG featuring the same components as Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness that seems to have been designed with my group in mind!  Gripping theme, co-op, gorgeous components and was challenging to win.  After suffering through Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness, it was great to finally play a fun game with all the characters our group has grown to love.

My only complaint is you lose the humor of the character interaction from MoM.  For instance, Joe Diamond did not drop his pistol on round one and Ashcan Pete wasn't wandering the halls, insane as can be.  But then again, I only spent an hour and a half playing Elder Sign instead of half a day playing MoM or AH.

Elder Sign was Yahtzee Arkham Horror where you do generally similar things but the game loses all of it's theme and narrative arc to save time. It also commits one of the what I consider to be Cardinal Sins of game design: when a card/tile has a different name/picture than another card but is 100% identical mechanically. What is the point in this? Visual variety? Ugh! This game suffers in that regard in a major way when you look at the various cards investigators can collect. Anyway, as long as it was a 2 - 4 player I would almost always choose Arkham Horror over this... especially playing events in a 'Tales of Arabian Nights' sort of story telling. If it was more players, I'd probably rather suffer through Elder Signs.

Arkham/Eldritch Horror the Dice Game? It works, and is a great way to introduce Cthulu to a group of people who have never heard of Lovecraft.

I am generally not a big fan of coops, but this one is tolerable as far as they go. This rating really only goes for small player counts with competent players.

That said, it is a fun, light system that provides interesting decision-making points of how to most effectively mitigate the dice system. The simpler rules system does however make it inherently less thematic than Eldritch Horror, as items mostly do the same few things.

I was on the fence about buying it, but was tipped over by the marvelous trailer. It's a beautiful game, lovely components, great art, in a terribly designed box. I first started a solo run and really got into it because of the theme, and interpreting what events happened in each challenge based on what kind of dice was required.

It all came undone when I played with friends (who weren't Lovecraft fans so we didn't spend too much time on the flavor text), it became all the more apparent that I was just rolling dice and nothing much else (weirdly enough my friends were having a blast...).

A simple game but maybe too simple. It seems to devolve to just rolling good dice and hoping for the best, as there aren't enough levers for players to operate. You get to add at most two dice at any one time, few cards can change the dice roll, and where you can go is determined randomly.

And for a co-op, there aren't enough hard choices to make. Part of the thrill of great co-ops like Lord of the Rings is the dilemma of weighing the risks or the impact of bad consequences and trying to decide which is the best option. But you don't get it here. The tension relies purely on whether you get the dice rolls or not and there's nothing special about that. I can get that with any dice-rolling game.

While Witch of Salem has its flaws, the game still gives you a sense that strategy matters. Not so here.

P.S. On the rulebook issue, I was taught the game but did have a chance to flip through the rulebook. It does seem unnecessarily obtuse, what with silly terminology like "focus". And as it seems that the go-to method of learning the game is to watch video reviews, and not actually read the rulebook, that says a lot about the state of the rulebook.

Cool artwork, cool components, but the game is really simplistic and based very heavily on chance (dice rolling is the primary mechanic).  While there is some strategy involved, I like my games to be more strategy based with luck on the side, not the other way around.

Oh my, this did not go over well. Getting elder signs was too hard, the doom track filled up very quickly. But then fighting the Great Old One was too easy, ever though it took a very long time. It was a slow, boring experience. I really want to like this game, I think there's a great thematic experience in here. But the first impression was awful.

*Update: Repeat plays reveal a truly mediocre game. Not good, not bad.

Sort of an Arkham Horror light with even more dice rolling, if you can believe that.  I like it because it plays in a LOT less time.  If I had never played Arkham Horror before, I might not think much of the game to tell the truth.  The theme isn't nearly as strong as in AH.  For instance, item cards are items in name only... by that I mean the .45 pistols don't elicit the feeling that I have found guns.  They just add a different colored die - no flavor text even.  Still a very good game.  
EDIT: after a few solo plays I feel less favorable about the game than I did before.  And I have to repeat what others have said because it's true: the rules book sucks.  It's terribly written and confusing as hell.

Elder Sign is an awesome, albeit rather brutal dice rolling game.

The theming is beautiful, every component, the artwork, the flavour texts, gorgeous, even though the game feels fairly abstracted from the mechanics of the game.

The theme suffers somewhat mechanically for what is tantamount to Yahtzee, on crack, playing against the Devil; that didn't stop FFG from putting every effort and resource into making the theme as strong as possible.

The game is ultimately down to luck; the push your luck element is definitely there but you aren't trapped by it.  Players can choose their battles, collect items, and work with their character's skill to skew odds in their favour.  

If you aren't a gambler have ever wondered how gambling addicts get into deep water, play this game, "Just one more roll, I know I can do this!...  Ok, this time!"

Elder Sign is fantastic value for money and plays as well solo as it does in groups.

This has been referred to as "Arkham Horror Light" and I would agree. This is a fun, cooperative dice game with a horror theme (however, if you're not familiar with Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, it'll be lost on you). 

I've played this both solo and 2-player and enjoyed both. I give this an extra +1 as my wife loved it which surprised me because she hates co-op games. She enjoyed the luck of the dice and didn't feel as if there was there was one player running the show because the choices are often all painful and difficult to make.

RATING: 8.5
Gaming: This game really captures the essence of Arkham Horror in a much shorter game. However, the one gripe is how easy it is to beat the monsters. This can be easily remedied by simply reducing the hit/time limit on the monsters, and several other house rules modifications. Ultimately, the game is easy enough to mod in order to make it as difficult as Ghost Stories, but with even more "flavor."

First time I played the game I was nt convinced, after 3 plays I am hooked. Maybe the game is to easy, but I've been told that if you play with the gate to arkham expansion, the difficulty level is raised. Hope to play with the expansion soon.

I still adore this game. The puzzley nature of the dice manipulation, and all of the special effects and resources you can utilize to overcome a wide variety of challenges has just been so satisfying for me over the years. All the beautiful artwork and flavor text go a long way in transporting me into the Mythos despite the abstract game play.

Theyâve also been doing a great job with the expansions adding whole decks and game worlds to the explore that add interesting new elements to the game without muddying the core experience.

Plays great solo and multiplayer, and my wife likes it, too! A real gem in my collection.

Honestly? Way too long for what it brings. Best thing this game does is managing not to completely paste the thing on. The mechanics are actually its downfall : should I ever want to play Yatze again, then I would certainly not pick this one up. Basically turns a flowing (if not involved experience) into a dragging activity.
Apparently some expansions are making it better? So I would hope!

I personally think that AH is the ultimate theme i want to bring to the table but it is just never going to happen in my gamer group but I am glad Elder Sign came out, although I still wouldn't say the hype is as much compare to AH but the strategy is there and I want to point them out! Choosing the location/ Adventure can be very tactical, because each character has an ability/ carry some item that give them advantage for this specific round or even this very turn. On the other hand, you need to discuss with the team who wants to tackle the more dangerous event if you are not gonna do it yourself. I think this is truly the beauty of this game, you take on a role as a heroic investigator with some ability but most of the time you are just an useless human against all the odds, so the best way to survive in the apocalypse is man up and give all you got and go all or nothing on a mission you were sign up for. It's lots of luck but it can be blended in the theme

Fun dice rolling game.  Love the artwork and the Lovecraft theme.  The Gates of Arkham expansion has really given this game new life.  Its a little long for what it is, and combat against an awakened Old One at the end of the game is really dull.  I would like a variant or expansion for more interesting combat if you fill up the doom track.  Maybe like a set of cards that need to be completed, and monsters keep flooding through it to make it more and more difficult, all the while the Old One is attacking you/driving you mad.

This is a blast to play. If I didn't have so many other games to play I'd probably be playing it. It's a cooperative where each player uses their detective to explore a museum, kill monsters for trophies, and eventually take on the main monster that controls the museum. I liken it to horror Yahtzee in some ways. It's a whole different game though. Sometimes it seems a bit too easy to win and it is a bit fiddly with a lot of cards.

I do not understand that people like this game. Its just a repetetive childrens game with too much rules and too many components for a child to be able to play.
I think it is a good idea to use Knizia's Dice system from Risk Express (aka the Age of war)and elaborate it furhter (as it is rather too stripped down in its original form). But this game does not develop it furher. It just puts a lot of stuff on top of it,turning it in to a long and, for me, very uninteresting experience. Theme does not make a game. Especially when the theme does not connect better to how the game plays. Or are people happy just to have a game dipped in their favourite flavoured coating?

RATING: 3
This really feels like a phoned-in design that's taking advantage of a popular license.  Yes the production is top notch but the game play lacks any real tension or decision making.  

Yahtzee is a better game than this.  In Elder Sign players roll a hand of six dice against their choice of adventure. This is really where the decisions stop.  Players then look at the dice to see whether or not they have completed any of the assigned tasks on the card.  If the symbols match you rolled well.  Then you take the remaining dice and roll again to see if you accomplished any of the remaining tasks.  Rinse and repeat for rounds after rounds.  

Elder scroll offers no push-your-luck or any real decision making.  You can't decide to hold off and score your progress.  Nor does it ever really make any sense not to complete a task if you have rolled the right symbols.  Yeah okay, once in a while you lose a sanity or stamina point, or a monster appears (these are dealt with in the same way as any other task) but the game play is nothing more than rolling dice and checking the result.  All the additions just disguise the poor design here.

NO REAL CHOICES.

THIS IS BARELY A GAME.  

A major disappointment for me after Richard Launius' masterful Defenders of the Realm.  

Initial feeling was this game had maybe three or four plays in it and rated a 5.  With thought I have no desire to play again after checking the rules to confirm we played correctly.  

I rate this a lowly 3

Arkham Horror style game with a Yahtzee dice mechanic.  Does a good job with the Lovecraft mythos feel, but finding the theme in dice encounters, while fun, don't help the mood much.  While this will never come close to replacing my coveted Arham Horror collection, I like the idea of taking it on trips for a quick AH fix.  IMO, adding the Unseen Forces expansion and a few variants (like hidden rooms) is a must for the necessary amount of replayability.  Recommend unofficial variants like face down encounters and limited movement between rooms for added spice and challenge.

Love the fact that this can be played solo.  Fantastic components, very dynamic gameplay.  Really communicates the feeling of Arkham Horror but with a much shorter set up and game play.

Contrary to what others have said, I don't think that it feels like Yahtzee (although I happen to like Yahtzee).  The dice rolls streamline the process of AH, but they still feel like you're trying to accomplish the tasks at hand.  

One challenge of the game is that there are so many little nuances and details that it's easy to forget one--advance the clock, mythos card at midnight, terror effect, dice locks, etc.  Still, getting used to the system alleviates a lot of it.

Haven't tried this with Unseen Forces yet.  I've heard it really adds to the game, but I'm trying to get a good grasp of the base game before adding expansion.

Fairly light dice rolling game, cloaked in overly complex rules, lots of Lovecraft theme, and beautiful production.  The cooperative element ironically added quite a bit of downtime to each turn (unless you really enjoy group decisions in a light dice game.)  I would put this one in the Munchkin crowd of games overall (likely only appeal to RPG crossover types).  As a strategy game, it's a whole lotta yuck!

I somewhat enjoy the game, but it seems very easy.  I mostly just play this 2 player with my wife and maybe we have been on an incredible lucky streak with the dice, but it hasn't challenged us.  The expansion helps make it a bit more challenging. 

Other then that, it's a nice dice roller with a cool theme.

RATING: 7
I've been dodging Arkham Horror for a while now. I've loved HP Lovecraft's fiction for quite some time but the length of the board game would NOT go over well with my friends and it's much too long for me to play solo. 
Along comes this game. It was a bit of an impulse buy to push my order up for free shipping but I'm really glad I picked this up. 
The rulebook is one of FFG's easier books to make sense of, the gameplay is simple and I have waaay more choices available to me than Death Angel! This definitely captures the feel of a larger co-op (Defenders of the Realm/Ghost Stories) but seems much quicker to set up and finish tasks. Solo, this game may present the D&D boardgames and Runebound with some serious competition.
Addressing the "too easy" comments: this game is soooo modular, there are many tweaks you could do to add to the difficulty. Eliminate the clue tokens as a re-roll option, move the clock (turns) in larger increments (4-6 hours instead of 3)...
This game is also quite expandable. More adventure cards, more investigators, monsters...I could even imagine adding quest-like (goals?) adventure cards mixed in at fixed points in the adventure deck. Maybe I should work for FFG...;)

I suppose a game about doom is going to make players nervous. Yet, the feeling that I'm losing from the start can quickly turn my mood sour, especially if my team gets some bad dice rolls early in the game. Dice. Lots of dice. I keep giving this chances (since before I started recording plays) so there must be something I like about it. Maybe it's the darkness of the artwork and overall weird mood the game sets.

A lot of fun, especially with my daughter.  The theme is there, although it is light enough that you can skim over the text and keep it "less-scary" for the little ones.  An excellent dice game that is fun each time we play it.  Two games came down to the very last possible roll (and we won!).

I started playing Elder Sign on the Android app and was hooked instantly.  It's an intense game that's mostly luck-based but involves some simple strategy as well.  It's like Lovecraftian gambling in a way.  

I bought the base set hoping to lure my gaming groups into playing and while I got a couple of plays out of it (and thoroughly enjoyed it) it doesn't come out too often.  The group tends to want to get into the more involved gameplay of Arkham Horror or Mansions of Madness.  

Setup takes a bit of time, so even though solo play is an option I'll just turn to the app instead.

I don't know if it was that we played against the easiest Ancient Old One (Yig) or that we just got lucky, but there was no tension at all during my one play of this. It was too easy to just avoid all the hard objectives and focus on only the ones that gave elder signs. It ended before we had a chance to cash in on our trophies or got even a third through the doom track. It wasn't fun, it wasn't hard, it wasn't interesting.

I hated Elder Sign the first few times we played. Elder Sign can feel impossibly difficult, but once you've played a bit you catch on and learn some useful tactics. I can see why so many people say it is either too hard or too easy, but I really enjoy it for a quick solo Lovecraftian adventure.

NOT Arkham Horror Light. It's a dice/risk-management game with an Arkham theme. It may drag a bit at times, but in my opinion it's a really good game. Clever art-mechanic solutions and nice, atmospheric components (though some are on the small side).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is everything that Arkham Horror should have been;
cleaner playing, less fiddly, faster turns, yet wholly thematic.
The wife and I both enjoyed this much more than AH. I didn't forget anything, which I often do whilst playing AH; flip Mythos cards, resolve certain world effects, move the terror, add doom tokens, etc.

I found the pared down rules and simplicity much more engaging than AH, and there was much less to remember, calculate and fiddle with.

Overall, a very good dice game.

After a few years, and a bunch of plays, I can't seem to bring myself to like this game.
I think it's TOO random, even though I like randomness in my games. This game though, heaps random cards, on top of random items, allies, and gear, and then you randomly determine if you can complete randomly drawn adventures/quests.

There is so much random here that all expansions can do is ratchet up the difficulty each time a new one comes out. Or make it stand-alone at this point.

It's a mediocre random-fest that's not worth the effort. I've had games end after two turns due to random stacking of effects, and just the opposite - winning the game in 4 turns, which ruins the entire experience.

I'm putting this up for trade in case there's anyone out there that wants this, as I can no longer derive enjoyment from playing this.

Un bel gioco di collaborazione in cui la difficoltÃ  maggiore Ã¨ quella di ottenere il miglior risultato sui dadi personalizzati. Lo scopo del gioco Ã¨ quello di sconfiggere il Grande Antico di turno risolvendo le carte avventura presenti sul tavolo. Per risolvere tali carte, oltre ai propri oggetti (rappresentati da carte in formato mini) ogni giocatore deve sfruttare i sei dadi e ottenere gli stessi risultati presenti sulle carte avventura. Un bel gioco, dettato dalla fortuna ovviamente, che perÃ² rischia di essere soggetto a barate strepitose vista la totale assenza di uno o piÃ¹ giocatori avversari. Consigliato!

RATING: 7
Nice co op game, although I'm not too fond of co ops, maybe because there's not so much cooperation. Players fight against the game together but there are not many events where one needs the help of another. Lots of "freedom", tight as it should be. Although the dice is too much and reminds me of craps, there are mechanics in the game that lets you manage it in many ways.

First few plays. It is an OK game, nothing fancy, still have to make my mind on this. 

What I do think is: it is overpriced for what it is. 

UPDATE
It has the only merit that everyone I played it with liked it, and wanted to play again. 

UPDATE
A big demerit of this game is that it has AWFULLY WRITTEN RULES! I had to play the iPhone version of the game to understand how actually it is supposed to be played. 
Now that I believe we're doing everything right it is a hard game to win and there is a certain amount of discussion to be made at the table and there is a mechanic that rewards collaboration. 

Consequently I'm moving this up in my list to an "8". This may even go further up with future games.

Well it has the Lovecraft theme which is a plus for me.  I only wish the theme would be a little more present but it's a nice game.  I only fear that it would be completely overshadowed by games like Eldritch Horror if I had it.

Quite a lot of set up and rules for a relatively light game.  Like all dice games there is a lot of luck involved, but the key is to pick the right investigator for the right quest.  Much quicker than games like Arkham or Eldritch Horror but with the same Cthulu feel.

RATING: 7
Fun game, definitely Arkham Horror Lite. Game takes about an hour, and feels like AH. There isn't too much flavor text to read through, so the game goes quickly but at the cost of less atmosphere than I would have liked. Sometimes the game seems too easy, but it always balances in the end: winning or losing is a 50/50 chance. The game isn't fiddly, the components are nice and it looks great. A good game, for solitaire and for a small group. EDIT: the iPad version is excellent as well!

Cthulhu theme, lots of dice, and plays in less than an hour.  What's not to like!  Gorgeous artwork and creepy theme make this a joy to play.  Fair amount of re-playibility with all the different characters and encounter cards.

Nice intro the the Arkham universe for my 8 year old son.

I like this game for it's theme and fun eerie setting. Sure it's a dice chucking adventure but sometimes I don't want a game decided by pure strategy believe it or not. Sometimes knowing, much like life, that some elements of our fate are outside our grasp just makes a game that much more exciting.

Another co-op game that just feels like a pointless race against a deck of cards. I like the mechanics of the game, but not the final battle.

We knew there was no chance if this great ancient evil found his way to our world.  Azathoth could not be defeated.  
Joe felt particularly lost when he first made his way into the museum, but Kate seemed to know what to do.  He followed her lead until he started finding clues all over the museum.  Then he was finding the mysterious symbols all over the place, the signs that could seal off the evil.  There were definitely a few close calls, but the two of them made it out alive, with their souls and sanity intact.

This game was fun, tense, and played in a tiny fraction of what it takes to play a full game of Arkham Horror.  It was great with 2, though we may have "broken" the game a little.  The scientist, Kate, was the second player and therefore it was always her turn when the clock struck midnight, essentially preventing the arrival of monsters throughout the game.  We didn't encounter a single one the whole time since Joe just avoided any tasks that added them, and he wouldn't risk adding Doom tokens when a monster would arrive.  A very solid team.

Been playing the crap outta this one and my only gripe is that I haven't lost a game yet.  I played half a game trying a variant I saw discussed where the adventure cards are laid out as a "map", so players can only travel to adjacent cards, including returning to the entrance.  I think this adds a much greater challenge to 1 & 2 player games since collecting trophies is so much easier.

Officially lost solo without any variant rules except no purchasing Elder Signs.  And even if I could I would have still been one sign away.  Hastor awoke and I was Clueless...Devoured!

[i]Initial Reaction[/i]
Billed as Arkham the dice game, this is an excellent distillation of the theme and mechanisms of Arkham Horror into a pretty quick yahtzee-style co-operative game. Game balance is maintained by having mythos cards come out every 4 turns regardless of how many players there are, and the way encounters work, with the specific tasks you must complete, is very nice.

Overall it's an excellent game and I look forward to another opportunity to play it.

Cthulhu's dark answer to Yahtzee. The theme gives some depth and the way how it plays out gives a sense of urgency, but it's hampered as numbers of players increases. It's more of a timing problem rather than a game issue. Overall fun to play, even solitaire.

RATING: 3
This game tries to combine the Cthulhu Mythos atmosphere with light gaming mechanics - and fails miserably.  There is no atmosphere here, just plain and stupid dice rolling.  

At the end of the day, each and every "adventure" task of the investigators can be reduced to:  take x dice and roll y fixed combinations in z attempts.  That's it.  Meaningful decisions?  More or less non existent.  And to make a mediocre game even worse, there is way too much luck.  Good rolls accelerate the game, giving you addional re-rolls, additional dice etc.  Bad rolls deny you any resources, making the game slower and slower and more painful from round to round.  

Being a fan of games like Vegas, Kingsburg or Alien Frontiers, I have no problem with dice whatsoever but this game really drags if you have bad luck and that is a pain in the ***.

Furthermore they call it a cooperative game.  Where's the cooperation?  You can't trade resources, you can't gang up on monsters and you can pursue different ways to victory.

Bottom line: from all Cthulhu based games I've played, this is by far the worst.  Never again!

Arkham Horror's flaws are well documented at this point.  While still loved by many, Fantasy Flight has been working on a series of games that deliver the best elements of Arkham Horror without the long play, the complicated set-up, and the impenetrable rule book.

So far, this is my favorite.

Like its predecessor, Elder Sign pits a team of investigators against the supernatural horrors of the universe.  They must succeed at challenges in order to collect Elder Signs that they will use to prevent a powerful Ancient One from devouring our world.  This is done with the help of clues and magical items.

Admittedly, this games does not offer nearly the same scope as Arkham Horror.  While Arkham Horror spanned an entire city and had a great variety of items and encounters, Elder Sign is confined to a museum.  Encounters and items may have different names, but this is mostly for flavor.  Many of them are virtually identical.  The encounters themselves are all mechanically very similar.  The flavor seems to come mostly from the artwork and the text, which will come as a disappointment to fans of the original game.

However, Elder Sign sacrifices theme for streamlined play.  The core challenge system is very easy to understand.  Someone watching a group play could probably understand at least the basic concept.  Role custom dice and try to match the symbols on the dice to the symbols on the challenge.  If you fail, throw away one dice and try again.  Lose all your dice, and suffer the consequences!

While it may not be as flavorful as Arkham Horror's RPG-ish stat system, it's simplicity really plays into it's strength as a cooperative game.  Any player can watch you role for a challenge and understand how well you are doing without necessarily knowing your characters abilities.  This makes it very easy for your teammates to feel emotionally invested in the success of your challenge.  In every game I have played, players have been huddled around the board watching the dice with great interest, cheering good roles and groaning at bad roles.  This is exactly the kind of comradery you want a cooperative game to generate, and it puts the game in stark contrast with Arkham Horror, a game in which a feels like each player plays in isolation.  There may be a few moments of shared enthusiasm, but the game can't sustain it indefinitely.

Granted, Elder Sign couldn't be exciting for 6-8 hours either, but it has the good sense to end in quarter of that amount of time.

Elder Sign may not pack all of the theme of Arkham Horror, but it delivers many of the games best elements in a smaller more manageable package that, and this is the bottom line, you will actually be able to bring to the table.  If you are looking for a Lovecraft-themed cooperative game, I strongly recommend this one.

This game is a love/hate relationship. If you hate dice and the random effect that comes with them, please stay away from the game.

Mine. Obsequio del Karku.

Tambien disponible en la plataforma iOS

custom tuck boxes. que fueron un currazo. 

Buen juego de aventura y misterio, muy bien ambientado. largo como para no ser un "filler" pero mas ligero y accesible que un eldritch y desde luego que un arkham. 

se echan de menos mejores figuras para representar a los jugadores. en ese sentido debio incluir unas similares a las que utiliza el eldritch (aunque la ficha tamaÃ±o "baldosita" tiene su sentido: es para poner el dado encima para marcar concentracion/asistencia)

Al jugarse con dados para completar las tareas el factor azar es alto, aunque eso es suavizable con cierta dosis de estrategia por parte de los jugadores y uso de los items y de la posibilidad de concentrar/asistir. 

En lo suyo es de los mejores, y un buen complemento a cualquier ludoteca. 

pd. en las ultimas partidas con los hermanos vega ha resultado tremendamente sencilla la victoria.

This was one of my must-buys of Gencon 2011, and even though I paid a bit more than the online pre-order folks, I have no regrets.

Very good push-your-luck dice game in the vein of Arkham Horror.  The theme is appropriately smaller from the main game of Arkham Horror, taking place in a museum rather than in an entire town.  The tasks and pressure, however, are no less dire. 

In our first game, we won handily, though frequent checks back to the rulebook made me wonder if we missed out on a rule or two.  Regardless, the game is fun, with plenty of interesting and difficult decisions to make along the way. 

The rule book can be confusing at points, and I'm sure that a FAQ would clear it up nicely.

Right now I think I would still prefer to play the original if conditions (namely time) allowed, but this is a great lighter, quicker alternative that scratches much of the same itch.

So disappointed, because I desperately wanted an "arkham lite" or an arkham dice game that played in 45 minutes.

This is a decision free yahtzee variant with overly complicated rules.  Additionally, the gameplay is abstracted to the point where the story is gone.

so very dissappointed.

Used to love this game when it came out. However after playing some other co-op games, I realise that there isn't much co-op happening in this game. I like co-ops where you can interact with the other players which happens in games like samurai spirit or xenoshyft. 

It's greatly improved by it's expansions though. Still best played as solo or 2 players.

RATING: 6
Far, far too easy. Personally I found it nearly impossible to lose the base game, if not actively trying to. There are far too few mythos-cards that advance the doom track, so you can usually spend as much time as you want to prepare for the harder adventures. Also lacks the flavor of "Arkham Horror" or "Eldritch Horror". If you're not planning on buying the expansions, get the app-version instead.

As a HPL fan I wanted to like Elder Sign but I couldn't. It's just cards and dice (even if they are specialty dice) that don't invoke a story or a strong feel for the fictional source material. Artwork by itself does not make a game particularly thematic. This game was a disappointment.

While I don't gush over Lovecraft mythos like some might do, the theme and the mechanics within this game mesh appropriately to deliver a gaming experience that is brisker than its older sibling Arkham Horror without removing too much meat from the bones. The die-rolling resolution mechanics give me the impression that the experience from one game to another might be swingy (i.e., one game might be incredibly easy, another incredibly difficult, another somewhere in between). Designs like this make me appreciate Knizia's Lord of the Rings all the more -- because it's a guaranteed nail biter every time, all the time.

Nice game! The art is mostly beautiful and the theme is spot on. I should say that dice-rolling has nothing in common with Lovecraft....but -strangely- I reckon that in the end it is a coupling that works well. It probably has to do with the growing anxiety that grips you while you are obliged to take away from your pool one die after another, every time you "fumble" your roll. Sadly, the interaction among players is kind of non-existant, which should make this game an exellent "solo" game. Well, as it turns out, the mobile video game with the same name (still from FFG) is a better investment for SOLO.

EDIT! If Played with the "Gates of Arkham" expansion this game becomes pure gold. I'd rate it a 9 or a 10.

Perhaps the best dice-game I have. I call it a dice-game, because the great majority of things in this game are done via dice. Whether it's actions or fighting, it's rolling dice. Some could find this alienating, too much luck-dependent, and they aren't too wrong I guess. But, in a game like this, it's more like risk-evaluation, you have to calculate when it's worth the risk to do something and when it is not. And usually you have at least some tools to modify your die results or even re-roll your dice. 
Anyway, that about the mechanics. The game is Lovecraftian co-op game, strong theme of horror, mystery, occult and impending doom here. You take the role of various people, with different professions, backgrounds and abilities etc. You then start exploring Arkham Museum during night time, in order to stop a cosmic-terror to awake and stop the end of the world. Small things, eh? No pressure. So you look for clues, items and other stuff that could help you, at the same time occasionally fighting with cultists and other ugly bastards from some dusty corridors of the museum. The whole bunch of gameplay comes from moving from the room to the other room and doing all the things that are required to be done in the said room, in order to advance. Sometimes you can go back to the exit and heal yourself etc. 
This is one of those co-op's that are really tense and keep you on your toes all the time. You really have to think about your actions, because time is a great enemy. There's only a certain amount of time before the Ancient One awakens, so there's no time to loiter around. Even one mistake in this game can easily lead to at least that characters demise, but also make you loose the entire game. This game is also very challenging. The only bad thing is that sometimes you have that feeling that bad roll results of the dice are ruining your game more than failed actions etc. That's just something that has to be tolerated when playing dice-games. Still, perhaps that mechanic could have been a bit less relentless. 
As usual the game looks stunningly good, for FFG game. Cards are detailed in their art work, dice are good quality etc. Only component related complain must be given from not including proper figures. Now there's only very small and flat cardboard tokens representing your characters. Would it really have been so difficult to have figures? I don't think so.
Even so a brilliant co-op game for everyone who love the theme and doesn't mind some random elements in his survivor-horror-world-saving co-op game.

I love the thematics of this game. The art, well I've seen it a billion times in between Call of Cthulhu the card game and the Arkham Horror set, but it still looks badass.

The dice part of the game is fun. Yes, there's luck in this game, but the game is about mitigating your bad luck as much as possible. For the amount of time you have to explain the game, and the depth you get out of that, it's pretty good.

I wish the items did different stuff. I wish there was an expansion to improve parts of the game which I felt were underwhelming.

There is little reason to pay attention to other people's turns, unless you want to watch and be amused. There is no interaction between players needed, but players seem to do so anyways.

For what the game sets out to do, it succeeds.

It was an ok game. I can enjoy dice rolling games, but this one really made me feel powerless as to the outcome of the missions. There are a few things you can do to give your character a fighting chance, but more often than not my wife and I just felt like we weren't really contributing to the game. We we're just moving along doing what the most logical step was, and hoping we could complete a mission but there was little that we could do to make it happen.

This may be my favorite co-op, though to be fair I haven't played enough of my copy of Pandemic to fairly compare the two. 

I'm not a big fan of co-op -- I find it tends to be frustrating and highly random.

Elder sign is thematic without going overboard. The dice and equipment are still random, but have some interesting choice that isn't too frustrating. I think the game's iconography does an outstanding job of explaining a lot of content.

Overall the game is relatively quick, challenging, and entertaining. I'm glad I bought it.

RATING: 5
[b]Rating & comments are for the 1st Printing with the screwed up rulebook; the Revised (2012) Printing gets a 7.[/b]

[b]tl;dr[/b] â As an [gameid=15987] & dice game fan I like what it does, though rules & timing ambiguities keep it from being great.  Like [i]AH[/i] expect to play it entirely wrong the first couple times, and then find it far too easy once you do get the rules down.

[b]tl;dr After the FAQ:[/b]  A kinder, gentler [i]Arkham[/i]âand not in the good wayâthis game is mild and crazy-easy.  The first printing is a total loss.

[b]Progression through the first 10 plays with the rules out of the box (pre-FAQ first printing):[/b]

[b]Thoughts after one play:[/b]  I'm pretty sure that all the various reports of "too easy/too hard" are due to incorrect play (a critical issue with other co-ops like [gameid=823], [gameid=37046] & [gameid=30549])âmissing a single, small rule* or even just altering the order of certain events** could make the entire system cascade in one direction or the other.

The rulebook is needlessly obtuse for what is essentially a push-your-luck dice gameâ[i]assemble dice pool, roll, bank or re-roll[/i] shouldn't be so hard to explain.  We hit many, many rules ambiguities in our first play, several of which were only answered with a very careful line-by-line rereading of the rules afterward, as the answers were often a single sentence hidden inside a paragraph, and thus easily missed.  Still other questions await an offical FAQ.

Other than that the game is pretty, the components excellent, and rolling dice is fun.  Also, I think no fewer than three people got eaten by the Shoggoth in the Koi Pond.

[i]Nice.[/i]

[b]After 3 plays:[/b]  The key to all push-your-luck dice games is, of course, banking and re-rolls.  It took a couple plays to figure out when and where this is possible, as the rulebook is less than effective at spelling (hah) it out.

[b]â¢ Success = keep going[/b]
You can keep rolling as long as you are successfully completing tasks, but, of course, that shrinks the pool, making future tasks more difficult.

[b]â¢ Clues[/b]
Clues are HUGE as they are the primary mechanism that lets you bank and re-roll.  Spend a clue to re-roll any or all of the dice in the pool.  Most games of this ilk allow a certain number of bank/re-rollsâe.g., three in [i]Yahtzee[/i]âbut here you're limited to how many clues you have.

[b]â¢ Focus/Assist[/b]
You can bank a single die on yourself, or a single die on a fellow Investigator on the same Adventure card... but you must fail to complete a task first.  A small booby prize, though with the die you lose for failure you're down two dice in the pool, so it's a gamble.

[b]â¢ Spells[/b]
Cast before the roll (a dangerous gamble) and bank one or two dice out of a roll (though this could be brutally bad if you are [i]required[/i] to bank).  Post-FAQ update:  Spells are now cast [i]after[/i] the roll, to bank dice you already know you want to keep.  Does the double-whammy of making the game easier (?!) and removing any downside to spellsâremoving all thematic coherence.  Lovecraftian spells are supposed to be dangerous, but it's all happy fairy magic now.

[i]Elder Sign[/i] doesn't feel like a true push-your-luck experience until you understand how to pull off clever combos with all these mechanisms.  Then the game really opens up and delivers.

Still, as a tuned co-op machine it misfires badly if you forget the small rules*** or get the sequencing of certain choices or events wrong.  Looking very forward to an offical FAQ to clean this thing up.

[b]After [-]6[/-] [-]7[/-] 8 plays:[/b]  I [i]almost[/i] get the sense I'm playing it correctly.  Almost.

[b]After 9 plays:[/b]  Okay, I finally get it.  Elder Sign is a light, storytelling larf, along the lines of [gameid=27627], rather than a tight, cruel co-op engine like [gameid=30549].  Expectations reset accordingly. 

[b]Final Analysis:[/b]  Man, I wanted to love this game.  It's totally in my wheelhouseâLovecraft, dice, quick co-op.  [b]But the first printing is a total loss.[/b]  The rulebook is wrong on several fundamental issues (spells, focus/assist, etc.), three of the characters need to have new rules scrawled on their cards, and the FAQ changes make the game stupid easy.

Lovecraft + co-op + easy = WTF?!

A good co-op needs to have an out-of-the box win-rate below 50% in order to bear repeat playâthe tension of not knowing whether or not you're going to survive [i]is[/i] the game.  It also incentivizes "beating" the game and gives big emotional payback for a hard-fought win.  Elder Sign has none of this.  I'm not even sure we've ever lost.

Yes, I could make up rules to increase the difficulty but that's not what I paid FFG for.  If I wanted to make my own games, or houserule the hell out of the ones I own (and then blunder through personal playtesting to see if they work) then I'd be doing that.  If a game is a "make-your-own" kit then say so on the box.

[b]I'm sorry I was an early adopter on this one.[/b]  Rating dropped to a barely deserved 5.

[size=7]*Like adding a Doom Token to the Doom Track whenever an Investigator is devoured.

**Like what happens when you complete an Adventure card:

1.  Receive reward(s)
2.  Move Investigators to Entrance
3.  Remove dice & take card as trophy
4.  Draw new Adventure card

is important as monsters in the "reward" line cannot be put on the new Adventure card.  An easily missed, teeny-tiny detail.  Post-FAQ update:  Nope!  Monsters are now an exception and can be added to the new card.  This change does the double-whammy of making the game easier while adding an exception to the rules.  Just what it needed...

***"Lose sanity/stamina" is entirely different from "adjust your sanity/stamina"âthus, the stamina cost on something like the Hallway on Fire cannot be prevented with Food, for instance.  Another tiny detail that is merely implied by word-choice in the rules... and, upon closer inspection, the rules use both interchangeably.  So, the question is, can you use a steak dinner to save yourself from a fire?  Or kill a Ghost with Whiskey?  Post-FAQ update:  Yes.  Yes you can.[/size]

Replaying, rethinking, rerating the Revised (2012) Printing:

[b][thread=914653][/thread][/b]

[i]Elder Sign[/i] is really all about the pulpy, three-fisted flavor and the delicious tension that comes from a 5-in-6 chance of [i]instant doom[/i] as the lone bone rattles around in a sweaty fist and a depth of eyeballs stare...

...and for those rare moments of real catharsis when that 1-in-6 bit hits and the whole table erupts in exaltation.

[size=12][b]Investigators - 5, Mythos - 3[/b][/size]

[c]Solo - 3 (1-2)
 2p  - 1 (1-0)
 3p  - 1 (1-0)
 4p  - 1 (1-0)
 5p  - 1 (0-1)*
 6p  - 1 (1-0)[/c]

[b]62% Win Rate[/b]**

Includes:  [thing=137479]Unseen Forces[/thing], museum-appropriate bits from [thing=189807]Omens of Ice[/thing]

[size=7]*This play had an inordinate number of new playersâthree, I thinkâand we don't allow alpha-dogging in our co-ops.  A crack team of veterans would have won this one.

**Though without the solo games this jumps to 80%.  I consider solo play to be a degenerate variant as I play with a single character alone; Mr. Launius has stated elsewhere that the game is really "balanced" (or at least designed) for four characters at a time, recommending the full compliment for solo play.  I dislike the fiddly overhead of running an entire team by myself, and besides, the game is much more challenging with a single character.  And that's a good thing.[/size]

I really wanna like this more. The mechanics and theme and interconnectedness are all there, but there's pretty much zero tension. And for a co-op--and a Cthulhu-themed co-op, no less!--that really louses up the whole works. It's far, far, far too easy. I've got some house rules I'd like to try, 'cos I do think there's a sound core in there...

I'd rather play Eldritch Horror over this. I purchased the app and liked it, though. But I don't know whether the complex scenarios (Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep and Ithaqua) which are featured in the app also appear in the physical version of the game. I guess choose this over EH or AH if you are short on time!

I really thought I would like this - a simplified Eldritch Horror.  It is not that.  Even with the Gates of Arkham it wasn't a tenth as immersive as Eldritch Horror.  And the real kicker, it wasn't that much shorter either.  And it was weirdly fiddly for such a simple game.  I played 3 games and could not get into it.  I tried it on the app.  It turns out I really really hate rolling dice to match symbols as a gameplay mechanic.  The game is not for me.

Quick and easy Arkham Horror Light, It's nice to not have to go through all those cards, and it feels like Arkham. However, the game mechanic is not as visceral as the actually storytelling/role-playing feel you get from the full game. After the novelty wore off, nobody wanted to play it so I traded it.

Elder Sign is a fantastic push-your-luck dice game in the Arkham Horror universe.  Despite many people claiming the base game is too easy, it's just about right for many in my playgroup who don't enjoy punishing games as much as some others.  

Really looking forward to getting the expansions (especially Gates of Arkham).

RATING: 3
I enjoy King of Tokyo, Pandemic: The Cure and Bang! The Dice Game and I thought I would love Elder Sign, boy was I wrong. First off, dice games are fun, but they can feel boring after more than 35 minutes. Roll for the Galaxy is the exception since it's not a "dice chucker", but a literal Dice version of Race for the Galaxy that works incredibly well. Even still that game can be knocked out in 45 minutes.

In Elder Sign you have to get certain faces on your dice "yahtzee-style" to accomplish "goals/missions" on different cards. Sounds simple, reminds me of another game, Age of War. If you succeed then hooray you get rewards, such as clues, weapons, magic or an Elder Sign needed to seal away the ancient old one. But if you fail,  prepare thine anus. These effects are punishing and could result in an easy elimination, making this co-op game that much harder. Add-in the randomness of dice, having to get certain combinations to finish the 2-4 objectives in one go, having dice/items locked, having to complete objectives in a certain order, not to mention random monster spawns that make cards/mission harder and waking up the ancient one which make things, you guessed it, harder or just simply game over, and you got a game full of randomness, luck and punishing difficulty.

I know there are ways to mitigate dice, and lock in results to use in future turns. However locking a die result meant you rolled that much less in a turn or having to visit the in-game store to trade for them...and that's of course if you got them since it's randomly assorted and also wasted your turn since the clock runs three hours between turns. When the clock strikes midnight well guess what? Bad Stuff happens. Plus items are beyond basic. Roll a yellow die. Roll a red die. I mean they have common items and spells, but they're pretty much identical. 

There is a bit of nice variation with cards that can heal you or instantly kill an enemy but that makes up 4% of the cards. How about cards that allow you to not receive any negative effects this turn or prevent the Ancient One's special ability for one night or when midnight strikes? And Don't even get me started on cheap game ending mechanics, such as every time you roll a terror die, EVERYBODY loses 1 health. Wow I lost a game I had in the bag, because I rolled a terror die 4 times in a row. Stupid, Stupid Stupid random garbage right there.

The games plays 1-8 players....WHAT!!! Nothing changes either(surprise, surprise all these cthulhu crap games play ridiculous numbers). only play this with 1-3, maybe 4. The only thing that's added is about 20 minutes more per player. I can't even fathom anyone who would play this for more than 45 minutes before wanting to sacrifice themselves to the ancient ones themselves.

Sigh...I really wanted to like this game, but for what it is, I'll stick with King of Tokyo/New York and Bang! These are well played and liked in my group. Elder Sign fell flat instantly with everyone I introduced it to. Sold it and don't miss it at all. Picked up the app for 99 cents on my phone, and that is slightly better, cause I can finish it in about 15 minutes, but it can still be punishing, but for less than a buck i'm not going to complain.

RATING: 6
A basic and moderately enjoyable, if rather too easily beaten, co-operative dice game. 

There's a distinct paucity in terms of the cards provided in the base game - all the better to encourage you to pick up the inevitable expansions one presumes - but what components are included are of the usual FFG quality (albeit with a great deal of recycled artwork). 

The problem here is that the game sells itself as being "inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft" but it really isn't. What it's actually inspired by is the Arkham Horror board game, which was inspired by the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, which actually WAS inspired by the works of HP Lovecraft...by this point in the chain the theme is not so much a veneer as a vague afterthought.

This is certainly worth the occasional play but it isn't a simplified version of Arkham Horror; it's essentially a clever but flavourless dice game with an Arkham style box lid.

I want to like this game more than I do, but I fear that the theme doesn't translate all that well.  While the roll of the dice does produce a good amount of dread, I never feel like I'm really accomplishing anything beyond matching up symbols. Perhaps I don't enjoy "yahtzee" style games all that much because King of New York isn't all that much of a favorite either (though I do thoroughly enjoy the more simplistic King of Tokyo so that may not be accurate either).

Either way, I do like the game, but the longer setup time makes it hard to get it to the table for me personally.  There's a couple of expansions out there that may make the game a bit more thematic, and engrossing out there, but I'm not sold on picking them up yet.

*This does get requested from certain friends though, which does make it enjoyable that way. If others are having fun, so am I.

Artwork good and the production quality is FF good ,but the game just is too simple for me. I like crunch from Arkham Horror. 

Not a really a big fan just rolling dice.

Commenting on Solo game:

I have to say, I thoroughly enjoy playing this one solo.  It's a very light, luck-heavy dice rolling game in which you are matching dice to symbols on Adventure cards.  The rewards for matching these dice is sometimes "Elder Signs" of which a certain number are required to beat the game.

I really enjoy the simplicity of the game, but there are also lots of opportunities to break the rules with extra dice or rerolls using rewards you have earned from Adventure cards.  The only thing I don't like about the game is the rulebook, it has lots of holes and I recommend going to the FFG website to download the latest rulebook and FAQ files, I think you'll need them to play the game properly.

Definitely a nice one to keep in the collection for when you're home alone or just fancy a quick game by yourself.

Nice Co-op game, where characters go to different locations and try and complete them to progress and close a portal before a big monster comes through.
Mainly dice rolling, but there is enough items to help mitigate some luck, so not just random.

An ultra simplified, dice-allocation, version of Arkham Horror is very challenging, well paced, and can be equally exciting and frustrating depending on the roll of the dice. However, its theme isn't fully realized and player action is monotonous enough that replay-ability loses some appeal.

For 1-8 players and a great time for those that do not want the huge real estate requirements of Arkham Horror. Fun game that will have you cursing your dice because they cannot roll that one required symbol on a total of 10 rolls. Dice rage aside, a great co-op game.

RATING: 6
I don't often have time to play games that go longer than a couple hours, so when I heard that Elder Sign was a shorter version of Arkham Horror, I immediately bought it. That was a mistake. This game did not have the depth of story nor the adventure that I was hoping for. Instead, it was a grueling dice-chucker that consistently defeated me. The thing I always heard about Arkham was that it was so fun that you didn't care when you lost. It must be a lot different than Elder Sign, because there seemed to be no fun had in losing this game to me. It was too random and grinding to seem fun to me. However, I'll say this. It's a well made game that provided a decent challenge. Winning this game, unlike losing, was very satisfying- but it didn't happen often for me!

Though I did not have to read them, it did seem to be VERY light rules-wise for a FFG game, which was good especially for this title. 

I had some interest in maybe buying this as I like Arkham but not the length. I think the game delivers mostly what it intended and enjoyed it overall, however I would have liked to see the theme come out a little more here despite decent effort to have it do so. Maybe we played too quickly, not reading flavour text on cards etc, but then this likely also means most of the theme IS the flavour text on the cards, which is not a good thing imho. Also it did not help that the game was really; Pick a location, roll dice & resolve - WRR (wash, rinse repeat) until win or lose. Would play it again but won't seek it out and won't buy it for now.

Yahtzee style dice selection and resource management combine to provide an enjoyable battle against Ancient Old Ones and their cohorts in the Miskatonic University Museum. I like the dice chucking and other features/mechanisms, whilst the artwork is very satisfying (plus high quality FFG production values). The theme is conscientiously applied throughout the game, although less evocative than I expected. A key reason this attracts (by my standards) a relatively low mark is that it quickly loses its challenge in an unadjusted form. The expansions change all that, so Elder Sign remains a creative and respected starting point to a great line of game-experiences.

The first few times I played it the game felt too random, so it sat on the shelf for a few months.  I came back to it after playing a bunch of other board games and am now starting to see some more strategic elements and the game is quickly growing on me.  My main complaint at present is a lack of story to it, I like the simple events the cards offer they just feel disconnected.

Elder Sign is essentially a Cthulhu-themed co-op version of Yahtzee. That sounds great, but the problem is that there isn't much interaction in the game's fairly lengthy turns and the theme isn't as strong as this game's bigger brothers (Arkham and Eldritch Horror).

Ultimately, there is just too much downtime (especially in larger games) for me to enjoy this.

RATING: 9
For anyone to enjoy this game, you have to realize a few things.  For starters, it's not an easy game - it will smack you around a lot.  Next, you have to realize that it is a dice game.  If you love dice, great!  If you seem to be consistently unlucky at dice rolls, this game will make you want to tear out your hair.

That being said, Elder Sign is a very fun game.  You play as pulp investigators trying to find clues, solve puzzles, and seal a gate before one of the ancient Cthulhu "Old Ones" enters the world and devours everything.  You accomplish this task by rolling dice and trying to match symbols that relate to the puzzle you are trying to conquer.  What these tasks reward you with varies from bonus items to Elder Signs, the keys that seal the gates.

The theme is definitely there in the cards, artwork, and feel of the game.  The only place the theme isn't the strongest would be rolling the dice.  The task at hand may ask for very thematic symbols, such as Lore or Investigation, but whether you feel that your investigator is investigating hard enough because you roll some dice is up to you.  I still love the challenge, the artwork/theme, and the tense gameplay.

Think of this game as King of Tokyo Puzzle, Cthulhu edition, but with very dire consequences.

Easy game that's great for an H.P. Lovecraft fix without the huge time commitment that either [b][thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing][/b] or [b][thing=146021]Eldritch Horror[/thing][/b] requires, although the game is much different from either of those.

Rules are pretty clear.

The artwork is the same as AH (same characters, etc.), but somehow it's done even better in this game. The quality of the print and materials is outstanding. I have the latest [i]revised edition[/i].

Dice determine your fate a bit more in ES than in AH, but I wouldn't say that there's significantly more dice rolling in ES. (I actually bought extra dice for AH because later in the game it's not uncommon to roll 10 or 12 dice at a time.)

[Edit: After a dozen plays I still really like this game, and it's a hit with guests.]

[Edit: You know what? This game deserves a 9 (raised from an 8; my second 9 ever, after Innovation). Easy to teach, learn and play; thematic; fun.]

Wow, is this game good! I have one knock against it: the theme doesn't come through the mechanics. But those mechanics are great, challenging but not tooâI've won more than I've lost (with games like this, I'd prefer it to be about 50/50, honestly). It scales well with player count (I've played two-, three-, and six-player games, and all worked well). And nicely for a cooperative game, one player can't really dominate and play for everyone. The box seems too small for the components, but everything fits quite well in mine (and you can just take out the insert if you're unhappy). Highly recommend this one!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2015)

My initial impression isn't good. I'm a huge fan of Arkham Horror so I was expecting a very good game, however my only play (2 player) was very boring. I feel the game is now pure luck and the theme is watered down. I feel the game is way too long for what it offers and has lots of obvious decisions. Very easy to beat and very low tension :(.

The components are good as is usual from FFG but that's not enough. 

Bottom line, I'm willing to give the game another chance with 4 players this time, but I'm not very hopeful it will get better. Most likely I will sell it.

RATING: 4
Supposedly a 'light' version of Arkham Horror, Elder Sign is disappointing. The game is very heavily dependent on luck (more so than Arkham Horror) and does not possess the narrative qualities of its elder. Playing the game does not make you feel like you are exploring a museum and shooting cultists. Instead, it feels like you are simply rolling dice to get the right symbols so that you can roll more dice to get the righter symbols so that you can win. 

In short, I do not recommend Elder Sign if you are looking for a thematic experience. However, if you like dice and rolling dice, and matching dice to icons that are on said dice, then this game is for you!

One solo play, plus a number of plays on the Android tablet version.

Nice cooperative dice game with Lovecraftian theme. 

It uses the Yahtzee mechanic (which is actually fine by me - Yahtzee's OK for what it is, albeit everyone round here seems to look down their nose at it) tweaked as per Knizia's excellent Risk Express (i.e. if you can't complete a line on the target card with your roll, you lose a dice before re-rolling) and puts some co-op mechanisms on top. You may not be able to overcome a challenge on your own turn, but you may be able to help someone else do it on theirs by banking a dice or two, or even by just being at the location to support them by holding a dice on their turn.

The art's pretty good in the FFG's usual slightly over the top way, which is fine for the theme. Some of the flavour text is a bit small for my aging eyes, plus as a lot of the spells and equipment boil down to roll an extra dice or preserve a life point you don't really feel you're in the middle of a horror story (I suspect you'd need some sort of RPG story telling element for that). However it does feel pretty tense when Cthulu (or his appointed chum in your game) is ahead and the end game is in sight...roll well!

RATING: 6.5
Very enjoyable game of throwing dices, and managing them. It all ultimately comes down to your dice roll, so I expected to hate this game somewhat but able to focus your dice, or hold on to one of your dice to your spell helped me mitigate the randomness somewhat. But I would have liked to see some greater degree of mitigation of randomness - then I would have taken away the charm from games such as this.

The flavor of Cthulu theme was not very strong indeed. I tried to read each of the cards, but nothing really truly felt epic. But I knew how it sacrificed theme to convert this to dice game, thus it did not bother me much.

For you get to control four investigators a turn in a solo game, it gets a bit tiresome. And while game did not feel to drag on unnecessarily, I was surprised to find out that almost an hour has passed from my very first play through.   Granted, this includes set-up and reading rules, so I can cut down maybe 10 mins, but for such a simple game, I expected a lot less than that (half an hour would have been sweet spot).

For how small the box size is, and unique dices that this game came with, this one is going to stay with me. I can see myself playing this whenever I have an urge to throw down dices, hoping to roll the hard six :).

I've only played this once, and I like it. It scratches a dice rolling itch that has been bugging me for a little while now. Like any heavily dice based game, though, this one is really luck heavy.

We'll definitely play it again, we're just both going to have to be in the right mood.

Co-operative Yahtzee with similar artwork and theme as [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror]Arkham horror[/url].  Items, spells, allies, locations, monsters, investigators and other worlds. It's all there. Yet where Arkham Horror gives some interesting choices, this game offers almost none. Although in comparison with Arkham horror, the playing time is halved, this game is still (a long) ninety minutes of Yahtzee. Sit back and enjoy the ride (or frustations) the dice provide. But don't expect much of a challenge or the same tension as its big brother provides.

Is both simplistic and complicated in that unique way that only Fantasy Flight can design a game (that's not a compliment). The dice rolling mechanics just aren't interesting enough. For me, the dice do not translate into the actions they are supposed to represent, which kills any sense of atmosphere or immersion. The game also seems very easy to win. We struggled to finish this. No desire to play again.

Based only on several solo sessions; I really like this game. It is much more manageable and concise than it's larger "sister" Arkham Horror (which I also liked but found too bloated). The dice rolling obviously adds a huge element of luck, but there is still enough here to make it challenging.

Quite a fun little dice roller, shame the cards are so repetitive, but I've heard the expansions go some way to solving this. Not 100% sure on the final duel but that's a minor quibble

RATING: 7
Elder Sign dishes out Lovecraftian gloom and menace in generous measure. It's terrific artwork contributes a lot to its ominous mood. Add in the fun that comes with dice rolling, and you've got a recipe for a pretty cool game. All that said, Elder Sign is the absolute definition of a "fiddly game". For a design of somewhat limited depth, it has an extraordinary number of bits to handle and adjustments to be made each turn. Some will find the requisite attention to these details tedious. Still, fans of Lovecraft and his particular brand of brooding dread are likely to find a lot in this game to enjoy and explore.

What a piece of hot steamy donkey crap!  I bet this was a great concept till FF got their hands all over the rules.  Too bad, it had tremendous potential.  

There are dozens of house rules to solve the problems you say?  No thanks.  This was the last straw and I will never buy an FFG game without playing first again...never.

RATING: 7
Yeah, it's a Lovecraft theme pasted onto a Yahtzee-esque dice-roller, but I don't care. With the characters from Arkham Horror already familiar to many players, it's easy enough for anyone with imagination to weave a narrative around the dice-rolling and card-playing.

RATING: 7
I'm not usually a fan of thematic games, but found some fun in this one. It is a co-op dice rolling game where you are trying to close the gates to keep out the demon. The strategy was in figuring out the odds of the dice and the odds of closing a gate. There were also modifier cards that could help.

Ok game.  Seems a little easy.

Would a co-op dice game with a placement/blocking mechanism like Alien Frontiers be more interesting?

RATING: 8
Surprised at how many people say it's close to an Arkham Horror experience but shorter and lighter. I enjoy Elder Sign but it plays and feels nothing at all like Arkham Horror. I'm very happy it's in my collection, though, I think it's great but just don't be disappointed if it doesn't scratch that AH itch. It's a different game altogether that stands on its own very well.

While I would prefer this over Eldritch Horror, it is just marginally. While Eldritch horror feels like fan fiction, this just feels like you're reading the table of contents of an HP Lovecraft anthology. In the end, its a cooperative game with dice rolling as its core mechanic. It sounds horrible to me, and it is. Winning this game feels like winning playing penny slots. A whole lot of bells and whistles, but not much payout.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This dice version of Arkham Horror retains a good deal of the flavor of its board game counterpart in a relatively quicker package. It's a decent tradeoff between the epic-ness of AH and a shorter playing time. My biggest problem with it is the ease of missing one or more fairly important rules at any given turn, and I doubt I've played a game where we haven't screwed up at least one fairly significant thing (forgetting to advance the clock, forgetting to draw and resolve a Mythos card at midnight, etc.) or neglected one or more key elements of our character (special powers, presence of clue tokens, availability of a key item) -- and this really hasn't been a problem for me with AH, probably due to the more deliberate pace of the latter.

Recent games have been with Unseen Forces (almost) fully integrated. With these options in, the game has more variety but also a much wider difficulty range, with some games being nigh impossible and others nearly suspenseless. Still, it's short enough that the variability isn't a deal breaker.

Looking forward to the Gates of Arkham expansion.

RATING: 7.5
Number of players: 1-8

Components: (10)
Again, we're talking about Fantasty Flight Games. They always come through with component quality. This game is mostly cards and they're all of top quality. The custom dice are beautiful and easy to read.
  
Rules: (7)
FFG seem to consistently have the most poorly written rules in the industry, which is a real shame because they also produce some of the very best games. I feel as if whoever is writing the rules over there wants it to seem as if they're producing the most complex games in the history of the hobby. For the most part, this isn't true. They mostly produce beautiful games that have simple rules with terrible rule books.

Setup: (10)
Set-up is a snap. You'll lay down some exhibits (cards), sort out some other small cards and tokens and be read to go. 

Area required to play: (9)
You'll need enough room for six cards to be displayed (with space for one or two extra as the game progresses), and for a few decks to be set to one side along with a "clock" to keep track of turns and some various tokens. You'll also want to have some room in front of you for items that you've collected. I'm sure that most any table with accomidate this game.
 
Fun: (7)
I like this game a lot. I think that it's maybe a little too easy to win sometimes, but also a lot of that depends on how the dice roll. There is a good trade off in luck and decision making, however. You'll always have several rooms avaible to explore, and they'll all offer certain pros and cons that may benefit or hinder you in the short or long run.

Theme Integration: (5)
I cut this right down the middle. I really like Lovecraftian themes and this works for me. However, it could have be replaced by anything at all and would have worked the same way. It could have had a theme that wasn't as fun, and all in all I'm so glad that it has the theme that it does.


Replay Value: (10)
The random nature of what rooms come up, the dice, and the various "bosses" make this game very replayable. I also look forward to what they'll do if (when) they release some expansions.

Storage: (8)
I ended up tossing the insert. The box is very small, but it holds everything nicely. Maybe you'll need to invest in some plastic baggies.

Accessibility: (9)
This game is easy to teach and easy to play.

I'm glad I got to try this before I bought it.  It was merely...OK.

There was very little tension in my (so far) one play.  It made me wonder if it would be better with more players (we played with 4), or less players, or solo.

RATING: 3
A streamlined Call of Cthulhu game in a similar vain as Arkham Horror. Between the two, Arkham Horror is a more enjoyable experience because the mechanics work so much better there. Elder Sign takes all the problems, except time, and magnifies it. Too much luck involved. Almost no meaningful choices.

Some of the rules are vague, and the game can be too easy (add some simple variant rules to make it harder).  But in spite of these problems, I'm finding the game strangely addictive (I even bought Elder Sign: Omens for my Mac).  I've raised my rating to a 9 because I play it so much.

This is a nice quick implementation of the Arkham Horror game.  It, like Arkham Horror, can feel overwhelming.  It's hard enough beating the monsters/minions let alone preparing for the final ancient one.  The artwork and the design of the game are good though.  I prefer the full game to this anytime and honestly this is not a game I would want to play as a filler so not sure where this game would fit.  It probably won't see much play.

There appears to be a nicely thematic experience peeking out from behind the drily Kniziaesque dice-locking mechanism. Maybe you ought to support it with a modicum of acting? A lot of challenges realistically rely on hacking the die mechanism with rerolls and extra dice, which you mostly gain by completing challenges, so the key to winning seems to be getting into a positive spiral and not a negative one.

It's too slow for my tastes. The play times run into 90+ minutes without there being any real complex planning or plotting going on. I can pack several times more fun into a 70-minute game of [thing=110327][/thing] or a 90-minute game of [thing=102680][/thing] than a 2-hour game of Elder Sign. If you're looking for a co-op game with dice rolling that is a bit less time-consuming, try [thing=113294][/thing]. If you're looking for something with more strategy, [thing=30549][/thing] is a good bet.

After my 2nd play of this game and a few digital plays of the app, I've come to the conclusion that I just don't like this game. I like dice rolling and I don't mind some randomness, but the dice rolling never seems very fun (compare to King of Tokyo) and decisions don't seem very meaningful. If feels more like the game is playing you. And, even at 4 people this game is a bit of a slog. There's nothing to do when it's not your turn and what's happening a person's turn is generally not very interesting to you. I could never imagine playing this with more than 4 people and I could possibly be talked into to playing this at 2-3 players, but even then I think I could find something more fun to play. A lot of people seem to like this game, so I must be missing something.

Played with 6 people, only two of which had ever played before. Very long, with long downtime between turns. Surprisingly little choice. Lots of confusion over rules with very easily broken elements to it (placing all monsters on a "dead zone"). Lots of small tedium to track, and when losing individual combats (which happens often) often the tedium could have helped. I personally think that games so visibly defined by their errata and exceptions are poorly developed games, and this is no exception. Playing this game was one of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had.

A quicker version of Arkham Horror, and just as much fun. Which is to say, not much. Like most Amerithrash games, gets pretty reductive when you think about it. I mean, if the whole thing's just based on luck, why not just roll a d6 before you even bother setting up the game? On a 5 or 6, you win. On a 4 or lower, you lose. Or just play the game, and you've already lost.

Fairly simple dice roller that I usually just play solo. Everything I read about it says it's easy to beat, but I have actually yet to win a game. I think maybe my play is too conservative and I need to open up my gameplay a little more...

Dice rolling/Yahtzee style game, quite repetitive after a few plays. Is a tough game you need some luck to win this.  Game length is a bit long for my taste. Solo is a great option, never play up to more than 4 players.

I really shouldn't like this. I'm not into Lovecraft though my dad was and my brother is. But this is a great dice chucker with loads of ways to mitigate your luck. Usual fantastic FFG components and a good rulebook. An essential for any games collection. Base game is a cheap entry point for what you get and plenty of expansions if wanted. Some people say the game is too easy but I don't think so - besides I don't want all my games to be unremitting hard grinds. Same size box as FFG's Rune Age and Warhammer Quest ACG which I group together though different game systems. A fine set.

Very interesting dice game. I lost my first game on the last roll of the dice. I had one more doom token to remove and one more life point on my last character. That was either pretty dang lucky or a game that's pretty well balanced.

RATING: 7.5
Based in the Lovecraft universe, players roll dice to investigate rooms to get items, other world cards, or elder signs. Players use elder signs to seal in the "Ancient one"- a terrible monster. The goal is to seal in the monster before he is released. If the monster is released, he attacks and its almost guaranteed that you will lose. 

Fun dice chucking game. Some subtle rules that are easily forgotten, but the more you play the more rules you ll remember.

It seems a little easy, but it has cool mechanics, great art, and if you like Lovecraft then you will enjoy Elder Sign. People say it is Arkham Horror lite, but i haven't played Arkham Horror so i can't compare them. I think it stands on it's owh though.

Tries and fails to deliver a distilled Arkham Horror experience. There's little in the line of storytelling, little variety in item cards, and little variety in investigators.

Only worth playing with 3 or fewer investigators. Otherwise, it runs too long and you might as well play Arkham.

Additionally, it is too easy to win. I lost my first game because my (random) investigator was particularly vulnerable to the (random) Ancient One. In my second game the opposite was true, and I dominated with little resistance.

One of my favourite games ever. I am still not very convinced by the modular approach taken in recent expansions. I would have loved a few more expansions like Hidden Forces, which expand upon the base game with new stuff. However, the system is extremely addictive, easy to learn and play, and extremely rewarding once you start to figure out the strategies (mainly revolving around risk-taking and luck-mitigation). Love it.

Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.

RATING: 7
I like the idea of having an Arkham horror dice game. There was Arkham express that followed the same idea but that simply failed to be a good game.

Still, I think that there is a few things lacking in elder sign that does not make it a perfect game.

The biggest problem is the paper weight characters. Most of the strategy of the game is to use your equipment wisely to fulfill quests that are going to give you additional equipment. But if you have no equipment, then you cannot succeed anything. Since all items are one time use, you will eventually run out of items.

In order to partially solve this, a good suggestion I made is to roll 2 green dice when searching the lost and found and keeping one of the dice.

The second problem is that the strategy is pretty low. Like I said, most of the strategy comes from which item I should use and which quest I should fulfill. When you are on a quest, the only strategy left is which task are you going to fulfill before another task and sometimes you are forced to do certain task first. 

So compared to other express dice game, like Dune Express, there is not much strategy in which dice you are going to keep over the dice you want to re-roll.

I don't like the design of the dice instead of 3-1-1-1 faces where 3 have numbered faces from 1-3, I would have used a 3-2-1 model, so that there are different odds for the 2 last symbols. Right now, skulls, scrolls and Terror have the same odds to appear.

The rolls required to win does not make sense either. Why do I need 3 terror face to complete this quest?

In Arkham Express, the dice system was awesome because each face allowed you to gain items or clues and you could push your luck to change the stuff you get, but the more you rolled, the more you had a chance to fall on an encounter face which gets locked once rolled.

But elder sign does not have the same feeling at all, it does not have the feeling of risk and fear when rolling dice which you have in Arkham Express.

UPDATE: After playing the app for a many games, sure this game is pretty abstract. The die faces and the actions you are doing does not thematically make sense, but the game is still relatively good. The first expansion fixes a few things like the souvenir and a few mission cards shop while adding the blessed condition.

Another advantage of this game is that you can play rapidly with almost anybody within an hour. The dice mechanics is not obvious first and they might not have the necessary experience to play the game accurately, but it can be done. My only regrets is that the app takes so little time to setup and plays so much faster, that I prefer the app to pulling out the game on the table, especially for solo play.

Arkham Horror, the Dice Game...and much lighter.

LIKES:

* I like rolling dice.
* The different abilities of the tons of options for investigators are always a positive to add variety to the game...as well as numerous Ancient Ones and different monsters.
* Plays fairly quickly and is much easier to teach/play than its mother game.

DISLIKES:

* Felt almost too easy after one play.  
* The different card decks to assist the investigators felt pretty samey.

Elder Sign is Arkham/Eldritch Horror the dice game. It's highly atmospheric and as it's a Fantasy Flight game the design and components are fabulous. But as a game this doesn't work for me. It's one of those impossible to beat co-op games that's more infuriating than fun to play. I got this game as a present from my wife and I really wanted to like it. But after two plays I had no wish to ever play it again.

This is definitely Arkham Horror light, and it is awesome! A fun romp through a library in ye old Arkham that can bring lots of cheers. There is some worry that the humans have it too easy in the game, but let me tell you in my first game I was driven insane, and then eaten by the GOO we were up against. Our team totally lost the game, but we had a blast playing. Well I did anyway. I am definitely going to be picking this one up when it is finally on sale.

The Arkham Horror game doesn't call me.  I am wondering if it was the novel theme of Lovecraftian world or the game mechanisms.  Elder Sign and its mobile game adaptation Elder Sign: Omen appear to be more streamlined than the Arkham Horror game. Matching glyphs in the adventures seems to be testing the player's conductive and deductive abilities at the same time.  It's like finding the right keys to unlock the next level.  There are 16 characters to choose from to form a group of 4 adventurers each time.  The different combinations of characters would yield different approach and strategy to tackle the problems.  A simple combination calculation resolve that there would be 1820 combinations of characters in the makeup of the group you selected.  The random glyphs you get from the book removes the possibility of a math game.  The ultimate objective is to find the sufficient no. of elder signs to seal off the gate from which the "ancient" monsters emerge.  The characters have special abilities that can help the group, plus the artifacts they gained after successfully completing an adventure. On the other hand, I always doubt, in this kind of game, that if winning the game really requires your own mettle and intelligence to construct a workable strategy or pure luck to resolve the case.  It is a popular game certainly though. As a wargamer, it seems to be better than some of the linear plots of those Victory Point Games, say, the State of Siege series.

This game was fun the first few times we played it. It is fast to play and fast to learn, which is very convenient. However, my group has never awakened the Ancient One, though many other players I know say the Ancient One awakens half the time. After beating it maybe 7 times in a row, the replay value has dropped for being "too easy". I am waiting for the expansion and hoping that will make it challenging enough to convince my group to play it again.

Wasn't expecting to like this - thinking it would be a dice fest - but the co-operative element made it more enjoyable (I do love co-ops), and the theme didn't feel pasted-on.  Massive number of tokens was a bit of a turn-off, so am moving to the Android App.

I've had the Elder Sign iPad app for some time now, and "played" that a couple times but frankly, I didn't understand what was going on or why. Now that I've played the "real" version (and had a better teacher than the app), I get it, and I've since played (and beaten) the app (albeit with the easiest guy). I've never actually played Arkham Horror, though I'd like to, so I can't say how well this compares, but as a dice game, I thought it was a lot of fun (I'm a sucker for dice games that aren't just themed/powered Yahtzee). Still, the co-op nature lowers the chance this would get played and therefore acquired. I think I'm good just having the app, though I now think I'll get some of the upgrades to it.

I like that it's simplified a lot of Arkham Horror's mechanics, while providing a similar experience.
The dice can be a bit too random, but generally you have some control over it.

After a few plays, I think the game is getting too easy.
Quarterbacking is a thing as with most co-ops.

Fun little dice game with some Arkham Horror flavor. It's faster to set up and play than its older brother, but it also has the capacity to drag out much longer than its older brother due to a more random way of acquiring doom tokens and the simple fact that dice rolls are the only resolution mechanic. There is some tactical decision-making to be done here, but it can be hobbled easily by a string of bad rolls or bad card draws, and the random doom token generation means that you can't even be sure you'll die to the claws of an Ancient One any time soon.

I love the style and the setting of this game, but it seems to me that there's just too much blind luck in this game.

In theme with hopelessness due to inherent randomness of die rolling. This is the best thing about this game, to generate such feeling of desperation. 

I dont think that what I get from this game is enjoyment. It's an intense arm wrestling with fate with a dark theme at that to make you go insane or laugh at how worse could it get and how tough could your luck be.

However, luck factors can be minimised with careful planning and strategies with numbers of investigators.

It plays nice and fast ,easy to learn yet hard to beat, a perfect way to pass the time too.

Only played this game solo or duo. I dont dare to introduce this to my playing group. They will not be happy with how a game can randomly make you lose in a flip of some combination of cards out of no where.

The game is uncaring at best but that precious feeling when victory is earned... priceless

I would like to note the replayability of this game where I found it to be different everytime. However, I'm not the sort of player who read the same book twice, hence, never replay the beaten Ancient Ones. This may change if I can find a group that can tolerate and can be bothered to have their precious time be potentially wasted at any point in the game.

Life is harsh and it will squeeze you every angle possible.
This game is a brutal reminder of such facts...

I keep coming back to torture myself with this game only because... to win against fate is one's life achievement in itself!

so you might want to ask yourself before buying this game or any Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror etc. if your real life is already enough an intense game of fate to your liking.

Another Lovecraft based game from Fantasy Flight. It definitely belongs in the family of games with Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror, but has a different game mechanic.  It plays well though, and knowledge of Cthulhu Mythos not necessary to enjoy this.  (Though it helps a little)

RATING: 6
I'm not too sure about this game. I was quite pumped up to play with, after hearing a lot of things about Arkham Horror, but never getting to play it because there was noone to help teach, Elder Sign would have helped a new player approach the theme easily. But I found Elder Sign a little disappointing. All you do is roll dice. And then roll more dice (or less). And then you fail. Next player please. Maybe I should try to game again and with proper rules this time... . But it was disappointing the first time.

First I thought the dice luck swings the game, but after some more plays I understood that it can be mitigated through careful and optimal usage of investigators and items.

But still it sometimes makes me want to yell at the god of luck, like most of other dice-based games.

Love the theme and atmosphere of the gameplay. Good game after all.

Good game. I pretty much always die and pick up another character to the rescue! The clock is a tiny bit annoying as we keep forgetting about it! Otherwise cool dice-rolling Cthulu-themed yahtzee type of game.

RATING: 4
Nothing better than Yahtzee with cool art and flavor text. The game is much too easy (unless played with very few players), too luck based, requires very little skill, and the random quests you do feels like just that, random quests that don't tie in to sealing away an Ancient One. This game does have the plus though that it is very easy for people to jump into and out of the game without affecting the outcome greatly.

Read the rules. Storing dice on either spells or other players is extremely important. Without using this mechanic some tasks may appear impossible. Remember it's a cooperative game. Just because the first person to try fails, does not mean the next person will, given a hand with stored dice. Scrolls for instance. 
There are dice in this game. It does have a random element. It is a cooperative game. It is in the Cthulu setting. If those things don't attract you, move on. Plenty of other games out there. All those things work for me. Fun short dip. Some people think this is long with too much down time. WTF? The turns should be fast. Play with a timer or something because your fellow players must be taking it way too serious.

It's an Arkham dice-based coop romp. There are some significant decisions to be had but none that should make the game play as long as the box says (1-2 hours???). It's a 30-45 minute dice fest with all the frills, spills, and tension of the very best dice games.

It's quality in every way, my only concern being that the game might be too easy for "advanced" players, IE people that game A LOT. Two plays in so that remains to be seen.

A fast and furious cooperative game dripping in theme. With the Unseen Forces expansion, this game becomes an instant classic.

I don't know what to make of this game.  There's no real "level up" function.  Whenever you use a spell or item, you must discard it.  So most of the time you are rolling the same dice, over and over, until you fail, often not wanting to use your items until its really important.  

Other people say its a wonderful game.  I'm missing something here.

Comparisons like 'Cthulhu Yathzee' and 'Arkham Horror Lite' are both fairly accurate. I enjoy this game because it has all the Lovecraftian flavor of 'Eldritch Horror' with half of the setup/play time and requiring one third of the table space. Turns are short, so downtime is minimal for 5+ players.

iOS majority so far.
I would suggest playing it on the iOS first as this makes it much easier to tell what is happening.

Played one 2 player game (2 chars each - the 2 +1 chars + the one who can sell normal for 2 dice and the one who can do lots of things in 1 roll) which went well.
Good game, player choice and boss choice can make it a lot easier. We won against Yig easily getting 10 ES with only 4 doom.

A few lucky rolls on the character who can do multiple tasks at once was very useful as was the collection of lots of clue tokens which seem a little over powerful considering their price compared to say the price of the other things.

Revised, 1/27:  Sold as would rather play a much more direct Yahtzee title like Favor of the Pharoah or a much more flavorful title like Eldritch Horror.  Also found expansions to add too much complexity for this simple game.

Original post:

Quick-playing Arkham Horror-lite.  High replayability and maintains the tension of the original.  Perhaps too dependent on luck of dice for some people, but luck can be mitigated through smart management of clues, items, spells, abilities, and choice of encounter.  Looking forward to expansions which might add more permanent investigator upgrades and consistent story cards, as only disappointment is lack of character and story development.

Essentially, this is Arkham Horror lite. My chief criticism of Arkham Horror is that the game is so fiddly that it would have benefitted from being a 1 vs. many rather than a co-op (a la Middle Earth Quest). Elder Sign remains a pure co-op, but it benefits from significantly streamlined gameplay.

The mechanics of this game are solid, if a little uninspired. This is a problem inherent in dice games I think; there's really only so many ways to dress up Yahtzee's "roll some dice, set some aside, and re-roll for a better score" mechanic. Nevertheless, there's enough going on in terms of gameplay to keep the game interesting, and even so, Elder Sign has such a rich theme that it's worth playing for that alone.

[Played once]

"Yahtzee with Lovercraftian theme" is a somewhat apt description.
Few interesting choices, no real interaction, randomness in spades (besides the dice rolling) and way too repetitive for how long it lasts.
A standard FFG box: beatiful bits without a decent ruleset to use them.

A surprisingly thematic version of Yahtzee.  It is greatly improved by both of the first two expansions but the base game is still decent.  The difficulty levels in the Ancient Ones do differ wildly and I find it is often more fun to play against the easier ones.

One of my favorite games from one of my favorite designers. It's got the heart and soul of Arkham Horror within a much smaller and accessible dice game. While the game relies heavily on chance, there's a good amount of control given to the players in the form of items and spells that makes strategy fairly important. If you don't want to shell out the cash for the physical copy, try out the iOS version. It's missing the ally cards, but it adds a new version of the Cthulhu quest as an IAP that's a lot of fun!

I'm not a fan of yahtzee so I wasn't sure I'd like this one. Turns out I did like it quite a lot. It's fun rolling the dice and building up special ability cards which assist you and solving the tasks. Nice variety of characters to chose from. I like the theme as well. The rule book leaves a bit to be desired in terms of clarity. I had to research a few rules to get an answer. Playing the iphone version made me realize I did a couple of things wrong.

Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.

This is an astounding condensation and concentration of the core challenges and themes of Arkham Horror into a dice game. It also appears to be quite a challenge, unless fate hated us more than usual and/or we got some crucial rule wrong. Which is entirely possible, Iâm sad to say, because the rules are an unwelcome throwback to FFGâs encyclopaedic style that describes every possible situation in detail, except for the one youâre interested in.

Shame, because the game is not that complicated, and there are few instances where you have to look up anything once you properly get rolling. With a gallery of a gazillion Lovecraftian illustrations at hand, itâs not surprising that everything looks swell, so itâs all the more worthwhile to mention that there is also some very nice flavor text on just about everything â monsters, quests and so on.

All in all, a very enjoyable pastime, and if Iâd like co-ops more, Iâd probably love this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Definitely very close to being too long for the type of decisions being made in the game.  Almost every game has me feeling a bit of fatigue from doing the same actions over and over by 3/4 of the way through the game.  Start wondering how much longer until it is over.  First 3/4 of the game is enjoyable, though.

However, I really enjoy:
-evaluating which location you should attempt this turn
-pushing your luck a bit
-gaining gear that helps mitigate the luck in the game  

Now, somebody needs to design a game that uses the same dice/card mechanisms as ES, but plays in only 45-60 mins. Age of War is too light and doesn't have any gear.  
Ancient Terrible Things felt sort of ES-ish, but I still preferred how the cards are set up in ES.

We tried to play the game, but we got bored in the middle of the first playthrough. The game offerd no interesting decisions - you just rolled some dice, then rolled some more. We might have played dice instead - little difference in actual gameplay.

Beautiful components, simple rules and gameplay for what is clearly a game that newbies can play (as opposed to Arkham Horror) and this is ok for me.

The flavour is lovecraftian enough. You play around with Old Ones and monsters in a museum. I think the theme of a lovecraftian adventure taking place in a museum is GREAT !

Yet, don't expect great sorytelling, there is an atmosphere through the (great) components, but you really need imagination to get some stories out of it. Fortunately, I have much imagination. :)

Sometimes the games can be very easy, and sometimes very, very hard !!

Played 3 times so far, without coming even close to success, but I love the dice mechanic (borrowed from Knizia's Risk Express and Age of War), and it works brilliantly as a cooperative game where you are egging everyone on to succeed against the odds.

A bit too random for me.  Needs to be about half the length.  The theme is not well integrated and it is easy to skip over the flavor text, at which point the game becomes a mediocre abstract game that is a bit too dependent on luck.

Elder Sign looks amazing, it's a blast to play, and it actually feels like Call of Cthulhu -- the mood is excellent, and the play experience is improved if everyone gets into it at least a bit (which we did). I can also see Alysia liking it, which is a big plus.

After our first play, it seemed too easy -- but we were playing it wrong, letting investigators live even if health or sanity was at zero. So for our second play, we upped the difficulty by implementing three of the designers' suggestions: even monster distribution, advancing the clock by 4 hours instead of 3, and rolling a green die at midnight and adding a doom token on any investigation result. I realized my mistake re: health/sanity midway through, and even that major flub in our favor couldn't save us from the upped difficulty.

For play three, we went back to vanilla except for even monster distribution and it ran just fine. No one got devoured, but the doom track was at 6/10 and we had a monster on every adventure when we pulled it out. I can see it feeling a bit too easy after a few more plays (though I could be wrong), but there are lots of tweaks available if that proves to be the case.

I'd heard that the rules were a bit of a mess, but I didn't find that to be the case; it's a nice clear rulebook, and nothing tripped us up. (I often miss a rule or two the first time out, regardless of the game!) The only real downside I see is that fighting the GOO is pretty boring; I'd almost rather just lose if the doom track fills up. That's a pretty minor complaint, though.

Elder Sign is just plain fun to play. It delivers on the theme, mood, and enjoyment factor I was looking for, and is more immersive than I expected. This is well on its way to becoming one of my favorite co-op games.

Light little co-op.  Fast with 4p - 30 minutes.  Nothing amazing, but it is nice to have a quick and easy little co-op that isn't too hard to win.  Sometimes I just want to win.

After more plays, including the expansion, I have downgraded my rating to 6.  Game can run too long for so few substantive decisions.  Very heavy on the dice, which sometimes leads to the usual frustrations.

I had heard this was a better version of Arkham Horror. The games are similar only in theme and art work.  Arkham Horror tells a much better narrative.  To tell a narrative in Elder Sign requires a lot more of a stretch. HOWEVER, if you don't compare the two, Elder Sign is a great game.  Its a co-op version of Yahtzee with monsters and that is much more fun than I'd have thought!

Elder Sign was my only foray into the Cthulhu universe.  There's no way I was going to spend several hours of my life playing any of the other games; looking at you Arkham Horror.  I heard this was shorter, and lighter, and co-op with a single player variant, so I picked it up.  

In the game you are basically trying to roll symbol combinations that are depicted on various cards, which represent rooms.  If you do that successfully, you defeat the monster inside, or close the room off to bad things, etc.  If you don't do it successfully, then more bad things happen, such as more monsters arriving, or your character getting injured in some way.

Two things struck me immediately about Elder Sign when I played.  The first was that it is very repetitive.  You just keep rolling those dice over, and over, and over again.  Secondly, though much shorter than other Cthulhu themed games, it's still pretty long for what it is.  After a couple plays I just couldn't bring myself to go through it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
3rd best game of 2011.
Don't have time to play Arkham Horror? Well, this won't solve that problem. Go to Eldritch Horror for that.. Elder Sign draws from same Lovecraftian mythos, but it's NOT a rpg-lite story-driven horror game. What is it then? It's one hour or awesome action-packed dice-chucking fun. Theme does come through enough for it to be exciting. It's not as cerebral as some euro co-ops (this is about step below Ghost Stories), making it perfect 'beer&pretzel game'. If you love exciting dicerolls, this is like best thing ever. Highly recommended.

2-Player Comment:
Works well with two too. I'd say best player counts are 2 and 3 followed by 4. 5 is ok. It's 6+p game in name only, too much downtime.

Expansions:
+Elder Sign: Unseen Forces
+Elder Sign: Gates of Arkham
+Elder Sign: Grave Consequences

RATING: 8
well, I enjoy this game immensely. Of course you'd expect me to be predisposed toward it given that [gameid=15987] is my favourite game. However, this is not AH lite, not at all. Sure the theme is the same, but it doesn't quite tell the story that AH does. It does, however, play very well with the full complement of 8 players, something AH does not. It's a dice-based set collecting co-op that really isn't too hard at all and there's some interesting wrinkles on the whole set collecting and dice roll management shtick. Good game

Addendum: Playing Solo with the [gameid=137479] expansion proved to be a lot tougher. This might prove to be a good solo game. A second solo game proved to be a cakewalk, let's see where this goes. When solo, if you can't get extra dice early then you are screwed. It doesn't matter whether they are Red, Yellow or White, you need those extra dice. The Investigator's Special Ability can make all the difference when solo as you get to use it so frequently.

We love this game, and also hate this game. We love it because it is a challenge. We love that it is like the Fisher-Price version of Arkham Horror. We love that it is co-op. We hate that we lose frequently. We hate that if the group is not in tune with each other, a player who isn't paying attention will make the game a lot harder very quickly.

We tend to love it more than hate it though. Definitely worth picking up.

RATING: 9
Picked this up for cheap, as a way to ease into the whole Cthulhu-thing, what with Arkham & Eldritch Horror. They seem to have a lot of stuff going on, and as I play mostly solo, the setup time is critical for me - I quickly lose interest if the initial setup is taking too long, or if it's a big hassle to reset after a game. Robinson falls a bit for that, but this doesn't have that problem - it's easily setup and you'll be playing within five minutes.

The game is tons of fun, too, although, one could argue that it's pretty easy for a Cthulhu-themed game. Rarely do you get a tense experience, and the endings can be very anti-climax when it's possible to buy the Elder Signs which wins the game - 9 games out of 10 you'll be hoarding trophies to get what's needed to buy one, and the last turn you just buy the signs to seal the elder away. I've heard Unseen Forces changes this, and it's on my list of games to get.

The game has some luck involved, of course, but the thing is, you need to mitigate the luck factor by playing good, leveraging all possible advantages you may have got.

All in all, the theme is great, the artwork is outstanding and if you like to chuck some dice at your leisure, this game is for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I do like parts of this game. I love the artwork and the press your luck aspect. However, it's just that the game goes on too long for what is basically a dice game with less strategy than Yahtzee. It has very few decisions, but takes 3 hours to play. I think it really overstays its welcome and I would much rather play a short press your luck dice game or even better, just play Eldrich Horror.
Edit: Played again with the expansion... The expansion is a MUST HAVE. With the expansion, the game is palatable.
Edit 2: Just played Ancient Terrible Things. There is no reason to ever play this again.

I'm not entirely sure why I bought it, especially knowing fairly well what I was getting into. The dice game part works better confrontationally in Risk Express, the Arkham Horror milieu with the recycled graphic elements isn't really substitutes the coop experience of AH, and there's so much more better dice game out there in this category, like King of Tokyo or Ra: the Dice Game. It's fine as a solitaire game however, so it has it's place, but unfortunately I'm not into solos that much.

One of the most complex simple games of dice going. So much happening that it could take you a game or two just to wrap your head around it, but once you do, it is a pretty fun time. If everybody is into it you can get right onto the edge of your seat.

A solid dice game with an excellent theme! Probably my favorite Lovecraft themed FFG game! It is one of my favorite games to play solitaire. In fact I think it excels as a single player game (if you don't mind managing all the bits). My only complaints are that the rules are a bit scattered and the investigator tokens are small and non-distinct when placed on an adventure card. But those are nit-picks of what is a thoroughly enjoyable game.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]20-Aug-2015[/u]:  This is a dice game based in the Cthulhu mythos.  A number of investigators move from one adventure card to another trying to resolve tasks by matching dice results as listed on each card.  The players must acquire enough Elder Signs through succeeding at these adventures to destroy the Ancient One.  Otherwise, the big bad will awaken and most likely, devour everyone still in the game.

While the base game is rather simple and generally on the lower side of the difficulty scale, The Gates of Arkham expansion brings a ton of stuff to the table.  There are several new mechanisms, an entirely new set of adventure and mythos cards, new Ancient Ones, a much stronger cohesive narrative and flow of gameplay, and oh yeahâ¦itâs hard!
 
The Base game and the Gates expansion seem like two ends of the spectrum in terms of difficulty and complexity.  Base is fairly easy.  Gates is pretty difficult.  Base has a simple ruleset without much extra "stuff."  But Gates has a lot more going on, many more actions, modifiers, and interactions between cards.  They almost feel like two different games.

Right now, I feel as though I want this game to fall somewhere in the middle.  While faster playing, there isn't much thinking required playing just the Base game.  And even though I enjoy the higher interaction and enhanced experience of the Gates expansion, I think it may become frustrating for me sooner rather than later.

With that being said, The Gates expansion is a must own for this game, IMO.  It adds a [b]ton[/b] to the game in every sense of the word - challenge, components, narrative.  It really does have it all.  Overall, Elder Sign is pretty much what I wanted after playing Eldritch Horror.  Itâs smaller in physical presence, game time, and narrative scope.  The theme is still not my thing, though.

I think the Gates expansion is far and above a better thematic experience than the base game, but I really didnât pay much attention to it.  I read the flavor text of the cards, and thatâs about all I got in terms of a story.  But what I do get is that tension and feel of desperation as more of the bad stuff comes out and gets in your way.  So, while I couldnât tell you a story about my session, I can tell you it [i]felt[/i] like a story.

To my surprise, Iâve really enjoyed my plays of this so far, and I look forward to finding the âright mixâ of the two experiences I had with this game.

Played it a long time ago but finally bought it. A great cooperative dice game, that also has a great theme (basically Arkham-Horror-lite) with tension, interesting situations, risks and rewards.

I hear the app is also great, but the board game just makes me want to play it more.

A little too dependent on luck for my tastes, but still fun if I'm in the right mood. Very frustrating to blow all your Clues, Spells, Items and assists and still not get a few simple results out of many, many die rolls. Often feels like you have no control over the outcome at all. And yet, I find myself coming back to it.

RATING: 4
Probably an impulse buy at my local game store, especially considering I have zero experience with the Lovecraftian universe.  The solo game intrigued me quite a bit, and I saw it as a possible precursor to getting into the [b][GameID=15987][/b] series, of which I have read many an excellent session report here on BGG.  I gave it a fair shake, playing several times (all solo, mind you) and I found it incredibly difficult to beat this way.  In the end, I felt like I was just rolling dice and collecting cards, and I wish I had more players at the table.  It failed for me as a solo game, and I just wasn't confident I could break it out as a multiplayer affair, so off it went.

I dig it, but the cards are super small.  I would have preferred all of the item cards to be standard size, with the rest being tarot, but it's not a huge issue.

It isn't hard by any stretch, but it'll help from feeling like you've cheated.

A nice dice rolling/matching game that goes over well with gamers and non-gamers alike.  It can go on a bit too long for what it is (I think an hour would be more than enough, and it can go two), but still generally exciting and fun to play.  Just wish there was a way to 'level' a bit more or effect the dice more directly.  The new expansion might help that.

Worth a go for Lovecraft fans though, I'd say.

RATING: 6
First impression was pretty good. It's a nice, light co-op game and I love the artwork and theme (which is very pasted on). It's a game I can love in spite of its flaws, or rather in spite of its simplicity. Many of the unique and common items are samey (+1 red die or +1 yellow die) and the same with the spells. It's essentially Arkham Horror Yahtzee, but I'm okay with that.

Too easy!

We houseruled it thusly: when the clock strikes midnight, if there is no doom counter above the Ancient One, place one there. If a doom counter is already there, add it to the doom track. 

This seems to put the balance where I like it - the game is tense and difficult without being impossible or too long.

RATING: 6
Strike one: co-op. Strike two: a dice game. Strike three: a FFG game. I didn't expect much, and I wasn't disappointed. Six players is way too much; I can't imagine playing with eight. Ugh. Tried again with three players, and it was much better. This is definitely a fixed fun game.

Indifferent; Avoid with many players.

Arkham Horror: The Dice Game, in 30 minutes. A fun filler, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I would rather be playing vanilla Arkham--it has just as many (if not more) dice rolls, and an actual narrative that takes shape during play. This is sort of Arkham Horror's game play, without the narrative. And without the narrative, what's the dang point?

I'd expected to like this more, but I think my single play involved a lot of distractions, interruptions and frequent referencing of the manual which bogged down the immersion for me. I played solo with 4 investigators and barely beat Yig. My strategy was to keep all my investigators sane and healthy while going for 2-point adventures to get the 10 Elder Signs needed to best Yig. I like playing solo because it afforded me time to think about each move, but I think playing it with even at least one other person would enhance the experience and maybe bump up my rating. GB won't play this with me because she says it's a campaign game, which is shorthand in our family for "more than 30 minutes". :/

RATING: 8
I struggle with rating this game, but not because of any specific flaws.  It is beautifully designed, both functionally and in terms of artwork; it leverages a fantastic theme (though perhaps not as robustly as it could); it does a nice job of guarding against player quarterbacking, the bane of all co-op games.  Add in a challenging objective, easily scalable difficulty, and a seamless transition between co-op and solo play, and what's not to love?

Well, nothing really.  It's a great game!  But the Gates of Arkham expansion is so good, and so profoundly reworks and improves on the base game, that I can't imagine playing regular Elder Sign again.  If Gates of Arkham didn't exist, Elder Sign would be a regular favorite.  With Gates of Arkham at hand, most of the original game is relegated to a quiet but respectful respite on the shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I would actually give this a 3 because I find the mechanics mostly frustrating due to gameplay based on Yahtzee style luck-based dice rolls. I feel like a wuss saying so, but most of the challenges feel predetermined to fail. I don't get much of a sense of accomplishment when I fail over and over again (defined as 3 out 5 failed rolls) and then occasionally I succeed. Elder Signs is founded on this gameplay principle. I heard this overwhelmingly before buying it and so I should've known better going in so it's on me for disregarding that advisement. The reason for that disregard is because of theme.

That being said, I am giving it a +1 bonus to rating solely because of the Cthulhu theme. I love the theme plain and simple.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some pretty neat mechanics in this short, fun game. Perhaps a little too easy.

It's easy to try to think of this as 'Arkham Horror-lite', but to do so would be to miss the point entirely. Elder Sign is very different to its bigger brother in so many ways that the two do not really bear comparison.

Elder Sign is a short, streamlined, yatzhe-like dice-rolling Cthulu game.  I don't care for it.  It is so streamlined that the theme doesn't come through at all.

An Arkham Horror experience...the fun way. There is tension (or despair) for the last die roll that either bless or crush you. Few decisions (which card to commit? Do I use my spell or not?), lots of dice to roll (that perfectly simulate how humble human beings are nothing but puppets at the mercy of invisible hands...[i]true Lovecraftian![/i]). 
Great fun, lots of characters and Ancients to fight. Keeper.

Elder Sign seems to have been designed for those who consider Arkham Horror to be too long and fiddly. It uses the same theme and follows a similar objective overview, but plays as a simple cooperative dice game rather then AH's more in depth adventure horror game.

Its nicely enough presented (even if its art is copied almost entirely from AH) and the quick, easy play even appeals to me -an avid AH fan- from time to time (there's no denying that is quicker to play and easier to get to the table). The problem is its been boiled down so much there's very little left to really feel, and you could interchange 100 themes onto this game without notice.

The lavish Lovecraft inspired art is neutralised by the simplistic and abstract dice rolling, and along with it much of the dark and foreboding feeling of suspense that comes from titles such as Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness.

It also appears very easy- we've trashed the game a couple of times without barely breaking a sweat (the doom track not even half full both times). This only adds to the feeling of playing a woefully neutered version of AH. I'd rather achieve a hard earned victory once every 10 games then sail to an easy win every time I play.

People are lauding Elder Sign as 'Quick Play Arkham Horror' and they are wrong, this is comparatively just a light and generic dice game themed in the Arkham universe. It shares non of Arkham's weight, difficulty or thrill.

Doubt rating of 7 will maintain unless more plays reveal the easy wins to be a fluke..

Update- it didn't. 4 games, 4 wins, easy as pie. I've trawled the rules and FAQs looking for something we are doing wrong that's making it easier then it should be but there is nothing, it really is just that easy.

Additional Note- I also now have [i]Elder Sign Omens[/i], the digital version of Elder Sign on my phone and its much better! Amongst other things it has AO specific monsters, adventures and Mythos cards which saves much of the theme, and it also steps up the difficulty with harsher penalties and mythos as well as perma-death to the investigators (no respawn when you die). This makes the digital game trump the base Elder Sign hands down in all areas accept player capacity (it only goes to 4), and I'd rate it higher as a result.

Progressive rating: 7-6

I really enjoyed my game at Gen Con Indy 2011.  More comments forthcoming.  I finally got the game and played it solo after my six-player game at Gen Con.  It was still a lot of fun but was an easy win.  I'm a little concerned about that so dropped my rating accordingly.  More plays will tell.

My go to game night co-operative adventure game. I am not a huge Cthulhu geek, but this series of games definitely make you respect that genre. Super fun, only complaint would be keeping the inventive expansions in order when deciding which version to play. Affects playability a bit for me, but still one of the favorite games on my shelf.

Fun dice game, but ultimately doesn't measure up to games like Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness when it comes to the theme. Age of War is also a bit more focused of a game when it comes to the dice mechanism seen here. I'm hoping the expansions breathe some new life into this game, however, as the base game on its own is just okay.

Arkham Horror definitely provides more ambiance.  It is the slowly developing symphony (with the right group, and just a few of the expansions thrown in).  However, it takes a long time to set up, and its fiddly.

Elder Sign is a very quick set up.  Games can be played in just over an hour.  The rules are pretty straight forward, and there's just enough theme to get the job done.  Not a particularly difficult game...but that's all right because it means that it can be played with a larger range of people.

There's discussion about whether this is just a glorified "Yahtzee."  I did not find this to be the case, unless one is also going to start claiming that Dominant Species is, say, a glorified Agricola, which is a glorified Stone Age, etc.  Yes, you roll dice, and are attempting to get particular combinations.  That is the core mechanic.  There is a push your luck mechanic, too, similar to, say, Farkle.  But there are enough twists to to the dice mechanic to make the game it's own beast: spells that allow dice to be set aside, items that allow additional dice, effects that "lock up" dice, monsters that require additional dice combinations.  All of these thematic "conditionings" of the dice mechanic, make Elder Sign feel unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In the world of Arkham Horror, players are investigators, working cooperatively to destroy the Ancient One. The main mechanic in this game is rolling 6 dice (of which spells can add more dice, or allow you to re-roll) to complete tasks, Yahtzee style. Failing tasks generally affects your sanity and stamina, while being successful allows you to gain items, such as Elder Signs, which a certain number are needd to dispatch the Ancient One. The Ancient One will awaken if enough doom markers are placed on it, which it gains from investigators dying, or failing tasks. When the Ancient One awakens, you might have a chance to try and fight it before he devours you.

The dice do add a good deal of luck, and some adventure cards are much tougher than others. Worth a look if you are an Arkham Horror fan. It's reasonably fun, though it may bog down with more players as you wait for your turn. But you have to enjoy the dice aspect of the game.

Strange one this.

My wife and I love Arkham Horror.

My wife loves this game. I am not so sure.

If it was down to her, she'd rate it a 9. But I'm afraid I just can't do that.  Sure it's a bit fun, but there's no real strategy in the way I like strategy - deep, tough decisions. This is just which tasks shall I counter when I roll a bunch of dice. And shall I add an extra die to the roll.

Thing is, I do have a place for fun games. Where deep doesn't really matter (AH, LNoE etc) but this just isn't clicking with me.

Maybe this will change with a few more plays...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
That rating is based on a couple of plays in which this game produced the perfect result of co-op games, where everyone was really invested in the result of every die-roll and the tense finish induced rapid heartbeats, a bead of sweat on a couple of foreheads and maybe a gasp or two.

I've had other games of this which were a bit more 'meh', but for those moments where it all works, it really works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love it. Great quick Dice game!

I prefer this to Arkham Horror based on everything I know. Usually for a game to be mechanically simple on this level, it also loses theme and becomes less flavorful. Elder Sign is a rare game that manages to be extremely simple and easy (without being brainless) yet is still completely full of theme and atmosphere. It's difficult to pull off and it makes this game appealing more often than many lighter euro games which take about the same time/simplicity but have less theme.

Although the rule book is unclear on many things my gaming group and I have picked up on this game much faster than other games. Iâm sure weâre still not playing it 100% correctly but with the wealth of knowledge provided here we will figure it out. Itâs turned out to be our favorite game from the last 6 months! FFG has a fish on the hook for this franchise out of me so I hope they will be adding many expansions to keep this fresh.

RATING: 9
Mostly played solo, following the unrevised rules.  As a solo game, this is a delicious way to unwind by playing the odds and rolling dice.  The Investigators are terribly uneven - actually, the interaction between Ancient One, Investigator, and Adventure cards can produce an occasional cakewalk, sometimes an unrelenting slog, but generally just a unstressed romp through a Lovecraft themed PYL journey.

Multiplayer feels like it bogs down with too few opportunities to progress the game before the next Mythos event.  I've not enjoyed so many multiplayer games though, so maybe that's more down to the erratic mix of cards than to an endemic problem with the game?  Still to be seen.

There is just way too much randomness in this game for it to be interesting.  Sometimes my fellow players would compliment me for rolling a good result, but is that really anything to be impressed by?

I picked this up for the solo play. Thought the theme isn't as thick as other Lovecraft games, I do enjoy the length and simplicity of the gameplay A LOT more than the others I have played. The game gives quite a few options each turn and has the Yahtzee style dice rolling I really appreciate. There is a lot of replay ability because of the different Ancient Ones, Investigators, and Adventure Cards that could come out of it. Also, I am mainly looking for games I enjoy a lot that have a lot of expansions rather than just more and more new games. This one seems to fit the bill!

Elder Sign is a dice game not grossly unlike Yahtzee. It's largely free of meaningful or strategic decisions, since the game offers better rewards for low-probability rolls which effectively neutralizes all of the Risk/Reward evaluations a player might make. It all comes down to dice, so just roll away and try not to fall asleep. 

Rejected.

Awful game, awful rule book, several misprints on the investigators card, one on the museum card as I recall.

I don't think the Gates of Arkham expansion works very well with the original set (or dilutes the theme too much... not sure, but it just doesn't "feel" right).

Numerous sessions [~20-30 minutes or longer/game] via iOS application on iPhone.

Elder sign is a dice rolling game that is high on theme but low on strategy.  This is probably what most folks would term ameritrash.  I find it to be a lot of fun.  Players work together to gather elder signs in order to seal away the elder god before he is unleashed and destroys the world.  The game seems to be a bit on the easy side.  We have yet to lose.  Decisions come down to whether or not your character can afford to take on an adventure, and how many dice are available vs. required to complete an adventure.  Once that is decided it is simple dice rolling luck to see if you succeed.  There is a bit of suspense on each turn as the dice are rolled, but overall there is very little tension building, especially given our win record.  The game needs something more to create tension and thus bring it to our table more often.  For now, I prefer the electronic version Elder Sign: Omens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable coop game... but unfortunately on the easy side. At some point, you think your luck will run out but you always find a way out. The game would have greatly benefited from customized difficulty levels (e.g. by categorizing the Adventure cards), which currently solely depends of the selected Ancient One. For a medium-difficulty game, select Shub-Niggurath or Cthulhu; if you wanna die laughing, just pick Yig or Ithaqua!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really wanted to like Elder Sign. I love the theme, I love the era, I love the artwork, I love the flavor text, but somehow all that just isn't enough.

The problem for me is dice-rolling. Yeah, there are decisions to be made, but each dice roll just feels like another pull on an H.P. Lovecraft slot-machine. Elder Sign is easy to teach and to play because it is basically Cthulhu Yahtzee.

The cooperative nature of the game is almost nonexistent as there is little interaction between players. On the bright side, that means the game plays just as well solo as with others. Warning: Due to how the clock works, Elder Sign shouldn't be attempted with 5 or more players.

From a design standpoint, all the fiddly little tokens were a poor decision in a game with the potential for dice to bounce across the playing area. Spinners like in King Of Tokyo should have been used for player's sanity and stamina and for the enemy's Doom and Elder Signs. Plus, they would have cut down on set-up time in a game that takes 2 hours to play.

There are four levels of Cthulhu action that FFG makes available to folks: a living card game (solid but WAY too complex for casual gamers), Arkham Horror (an adventure game for people with 5+ hrs to spend), Eldritch Horror (for people who wish Arkham Horror was shorter)... and Elder Sign, the best-of-show that adds all the flavor and reduces complexity to virtually zero.  (We shall not speak of Mansions of Madness.)

If you've played any recent dice game, you'll recognize Elder Sign's core.  Prevent the Old Ones from coming into our world, or die trying.

If there's any issue to this game, it's that the "co-op" feel is thin.  You're all on the same page but there's little bonafide interaction unless you share the same space, which only generally happens if someone failed an adventure.  Also, many of the items are thematically compelling but mechanically the same in regard to bonuses.  If you can overlook these issues, you'll have fun with Elder Sign.

Otherwise, honestly, just play Call (or Trail) of Cthulhu.  You'll be happier that way.

RATING: 7
Nice mechanic that allow lots of decision making and avoid a good deal of the luck factor inherent to dice throwing.

The main drawback is that the game is far too easy (only one loss in mhy first 10 games, mostly due to back luck, and most of the wins were a walk in the park). Expansions address that.

Also, the game is a bit long (you do the same things from the start to the end).

I don't like to play it with more than 2-3 players, because of the downtime. Each player can use more than one character (and it can be played solo this way).

The drudgery has been filtered out from Arkham Horror so that we're left with a neat dice-roller.

The overall idea and mechanics are nice, but I did not play it much "on the table". It did feel like it could be a nice filler coop, but it just seems too long for the amount of dice rolling luck and a little bit too repetitive for being that filler. Also with more players downtime can get a problem and it does not feel very cooperative, it's almost more of a multiplayer solo game. 

Rating based only on the actual boardgame. I actually do like it quiet a lot when playing it solo on the tablet as it helps a lot with bringing down the playtime to what it should be.

Le signe des anciens est grosso modo une version 'light' des autres jeux Horreur Ã  Arkham (Les contrÃ©es, etc.). En revanche la thÃ©matique et l'ambiance sont lÃ . Que l'on soit fan dÃ©jÃ  du culte de Cthulhu ou que l'on souhaite dÃ©couvrir (je trouve que l'aspect coopÃ©ratif du jeu est trÃ¨s bien pour faire dÃ©couvrir justement), ce jeu est trÃ¨s facile Ã  sortir. La mise en place est relativement rapide et une fois la partie lancÃ©e, le stress est de mise :D. Il arrive frÃ©quemment que l'on hurle soit de plaisir (tous ensemble en plus) sur un ultime jet de dÃ© rÃ©ussi ou, Ã  l'inverse un Ã©chec cuisant qui va nous rendre la tÃ¢che encore plus difficile! Pour arriver Ã  clouer le bec Ã  ces grands anciens, il va falloir coopÃ©rer en bonne intelligence et calculer les coups Ã  venir en fonction des capactitÃ©s de chaque investigateurs, des aventures prÃ©sentes, des malus du grand ancien Ã  affronter et le meilleur pour la fin : les fameuses cartes "Mythe" qui apporte son lot d'Ã©vÃ¨nements parfois assez destructeurs. Pour moi c'est un jeu incontournable. Je l'ai pris avec sa premiÃ¨re extension Forces Occultes qui, je pense, une extension qui est devenue indispensable car elle rÃ©Ã©quilibre pas mal de rÃ¨gles qui donne au jeu encore plus de plaisirs :-)

In the museum a great old one is on the verge of awakening and you have to prevent this from happening. How you do that: collecting enough Elder signs in Adventures. The Game has really cool mechanics, using dice in order to solve adventures. The adventure cards become trophies you can use in order to heal, buy stuff or defeat monsters. Also you get rewards for mastering the adventures. These include the much needed elder signs. 

I really like the mechanis, with rolling the dice and forwarding the clock. The components are really cool and the whole game is small enough to take with you on a holiday (unlike Eldritch Horror). On the downside the game is easily beat, a problem solved by adding the expansions.

[b]Elder Sign[/b]

[i]Another co-op game that fell completely flat for me. Part of it may be due to how the game played out. We got the crap beaten out of us, but once the great one came out we handily defeated it [i](which felt very anti-climactic)[/i]. The Cthulhu Mythos isn't necessarily my thing, it's approaching zombie status as far as pop culture over saturation. 

There is not much else to say, the game play was kind of blah. Basically you are rolling dice yahtzee style to fill orders on a card [i](room)[/i]. Succeed and get a reward, fail and bad things happen. I can also see how this game could easily outstay it's welcome because the game play is so basic. [/i]

Lovely components and theme, although the theme isn't particularly reflected in the mechanics.  Cooperative, but not in a substantial way.  Too easy (going to try to house rule to fix this).  But I somehow walk away liking it because the parts are just so darn pretty.

Could this game be more intense than AH? When I play this game sweat drips down my brow and I barely speak a word for the full game. I was thinking when I purchased this game that it was going to be a medium to medium light dice fest with an AH theme. Boy was I wrong! This game has all the intensity and I would say the length of game play that AH has...just fewer components and more table space. Don't get me wrong...I like it...I like it alot. It is still very difficult to beat.

This will never be a substitute for AH for me though. I do feel the stories and events you read about as you play AH definitely make the experience for me. Perhaps those stories also temper the extreme intensity of trying to make great die rolls or be devoured...this is what feels to be the nature of Elder Sign. Both games are fun to play and have their own time and place to be played.

I was looking for a game that was unlike the usual games I collect. I had seen much of Arkham Horror on the geek, but had never played it. I thought about getting it, but a friend reminded me that the game takes about 4 hours to play. There is no way it would get to hit the table. Then I heard about Elder Sign & saw a few video reviews (UndeadViking, Tom Vasel) & so decided to grab a copy. Got it on the table the next day & was pleasantly surprised. It played well. Am glad to have it in my collection.

8/10/2011 - played 3 player game with gaming newbies. Wasn't sure how they would take the game, but they loved it. Towards the end of the game there was the opportunity to exchange trophies for Elder Signs to win the game, but they declined this, wanting to get a bit more of the game in.

Great thematic Co-operative game in which you sign up for missions rolling the dice. Dice luck game based. You must earn elder tokens before the monster gets the doomed  tokens. As you have different monsters and missions the game appears to have some replay ability, however my friends complained about the same character being randomly picked. And if you don't like your character you may help him die to have another one, therefore you never die in this game which made me think the game its to easy sometimes. Nice roll player game. Dice game. Light game for new and experienced gamers.

RATING: 7
Arguably the most beautifully worked theme for Yahtzee ever produced. Reveal 6 locations from the deck, each location has a series of combination sets you need to complete (some in a specific order) with your dice. Each successful roll which completes one of the sets in a location's series is locked away, reducing the dice you get to roll towards the next set. Each failure loses you one die for the next roll, but you do have the option to lock 1 die in if you want. All series must complete within the one player's turn to be successful. Each room has different penalties for failure (the inevitable Cthulhu loss of sanity and health) and rewards for success (elder sign tokens, clue tokens, which allow re-rolls, plus the familiarly based skill cards such as weapons, skills, spells and allies, which mostly provide dice addition and manipulation abilities), and draw a new location card once done. Anyway, keep going until you're done - you need a bunch elder sign tokens before the turn based timer completes, with an event card mixing things up every 4 turns. So all the good stuff in a good dice game is there, plus great theme. The only reason I haven't rated it higher is that the game simply goes too long for what is essentially just a roll-fest, where the major decision each turn is whether to use up a clue token to re-roll.

Fun and addicting! A Light-Medium Dice game where players roll dice to beat tasks and maybe monsters on adventure cards while mitigating their stamina, sanity, and other resources. This game was everything I had hoped it would be. Loaded with tactical choices, and has a lot of replayability. The key element is the dice rolling mechanisms; therefore people should see or get a demo of this game before buying it. Still, I find this game is more than the sum of it's parts.

Tough Game !! Good look and design to this. Reminds me a just a little of Space Hulk - Death Angel with a lot of dice. I like how this is challenging, yet I can still play when I'm tired. Good, but difficult 2-player. I also like how a 2 player game can happen in 60 minutes or less. I haven't tried solo yet.

Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

RATING: 6
I like it, but there is a lot more errata and FAQ needed than there ought to be....  Hopefully there will be a second edition with more attention to detail.  Also a bit long and mechanical for what it is.  Traded.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
"Not terrible, but ultimately it's too long for the level of randomness, or too random for the length. The postage-stamp monster images that you put face-down don't help the theme. The flavor text font is unreadable."

What I like:
- Pure cooperative game
- Cool dice
- Reasonable weight and complexity

What I don't like:
- The sense of frustration if you FAIL a lot of tasks
- There is very little actual cooperation:
  - "Assisting" other players is a [b]very[/b] weak action
  - No way to trade items or trophies
- Can run long. Would be best at 30-45 minutes, but can go 2 hours

It's a good co-op, but not one of my favorites. With most co-ops, you are continually making a little progress. Perhaps not as much as you wanted, and there may be setbacks, but it is fluid. In Elder Sign, there is a very discrete SUCCEED/FAIL status on each task and each adventure. We had a long series of failures in our first game, with nothing we could do about it. That was demoralizing.

For whatever reason, other "move around and complete dice challenge" games (like Star Trek: Expeditions and Exalted: Legacy of the Unconquered Sun) don't feel punishing like this one.

I think my initial rating was a 5 or 6. Then it went up as high as a solid 7. Now it's back down. 

I would put the weight at 2.5, a bit higher than the current BGG-voted value. Based on several plays of ES and several of Witch of Salem, my wife and I both prefer WoS as a light Lovecraft-themed game. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun spooky theme in the Cthulhu universe (like Arkham Horror light). Players have several actions they can take. The dice rolling system is an exact replica of Knizia's Risk Express or Samurai War.

The game is easy to pick up, has a nice push your luck element snd beautiful cards. The many investigators and GOO give it a lot of replayability.

Despite all its strengths it still only feels like just an ok game experience. Maybe something that can be improved with expansions...

RATING: 8
A nice, accessible coop with the general theme of Arkham Horror but less complexity.  The game plays easily enough and it is easy to both teach and learn.  The way that the game intertwines challenges in the museum with those in the outer worlds is a nice twist, and gives the players lots of options.

Elder sign also does a good job of getting difficulty right.  Sure, you can occasionally have games where it feels like either the players or the Old One are just cruising along in unstoppable fashion, but those are pretty rare.  The game is often a nail-biter with the outcome determined just the way you'd want to see it if this were a movie.

If there's one thing that can get out of control in-game, it's selecting the characters players will use.  Although they are generally balanced, some combinations simply have far, far more utility than others.  Once you figure those out, the game can become easier than it should be.  However, that's easy to fix by randomizing character selection to some extent so that you can't build a "dream team" every time you play.

11/02/11 - Elder Sign is definitely a lighter version of Arkham Horror but I think I have to agree with the majority and say it is too easy. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing the game and love the excitement of getting the right symbol on your last roll.

However, I never feel the dread of an uncontrollable game and the threat of the Old One is nonexistent. I hope that the expansions will raise the difficulty of the game. It's FFG, so you know there will be an expansion or two.

I'll rate it a 7 due to the fun of rolling the die and the highs and lows of the randomness of completing missions.

I would have liked a more detailed one page reference sheet on rear or the booklet.

I will use this when I am too lazy to set up Eldritch Horror :)

Add Unseen Forces. Even better :)

RATING: 7.5
Enjoyable way to scratch the Lovecraftian itch - might be too easy once you hone your focus on 1) collecting clues for rerolling dice and 2) prioritizing adventures that give Elder Signs as rewards.  On the other hand, the Allies seemed very underpowered given how hard it can be to get one, and the "dice-locking" features (adventures, monsters) were annoying, as they made completing certain adventures without "unlocking" those dice first very unlikely.  We'll be interested to see where this goes in expansions - for now, it is providing enough challenge and atmosphere to stay on the table.  Beware the Public Library!

Based on one play: A very basic and simple co-operative game that is mostly based on dice rolling. You chose a mission then attempt to roll the dice in sets as described on the card. Each character has a special ability and you can accumulate cards that add more. Simply, but not really fun as it is mostly just luck.

A great dice game with a cool theme. The co-op aspect has made this a good choice when Iâve had a group that includes people that donât normally game, plus most people understand the roll all your dice then re-roll some a couple of times. Itâs got a good balance between winning and losing and doesnât tend to overstay its welcome. Now that Iâve got Arkham Horror this doesnât get picked up if the group fancies a pulp-horror hit, but if you donât like the idea of a million pieces and arcane rules Elder Sign might be the better fit.

I was predisposed to not liking this as I do not like co-ops to begin with, but this was really bad.  There was way too much time between turns and there were way too many interruptions so gobs of text could get resolved.  This would be tolerable if it were a 30 minute game, but 90 minutes (or even closer to 120) is entirely too long.

A yahtzee-style dice-rolling mechanic integrated into a cooperative game that features both the glacial pacing and feelings of futility of Arhkam Horror.

While it's not quite dripping with them as either of it's bigger brothers, it is fun and tense when rolling dice. I think it plays better with fewer players and at most 4 players.

I'd love to see what the expansion holds. I've also heard this game is too easy, but from what I've seen, that is not the case. Or at least for me it wasn't.

Game is a 4.5 with anything other than the Gates of Arkham expansion.  Without that expansion you can win the game every time and it is flavorless.  With Gates of Arkham, the game becomes playable, is very hard with some tough choices.  However; for all of the content out there, which you lose by using this expansion, the game is just not that great.

At the end of the day though, for as long as it takes to play this lighter version of Arkham Horror, I would much rather just pull out Eldritch Horror.

Not to sound detrimental, but Yahtzee themed as Lovecraftian does not a better game than Arkham Horror make.  The mechanics don't really suit the theme in my opinion.  I know, I know... Arkham Horror has plenty of dice you say.  But somehow this is different.

Not usually a fan of these types of heavily thematic games, but I quite like Elder Sign. It's got lots of good tension with the dice rolls, and you often feel overwhelmed when monsters are pouring out or your yellow or/and red die get locked up. Go in a room, roll the right symbols (or not), get stuff to help you out, go to another room. Straight forward but the dice rolling is actually quite interesting. This game is great when the mood is right, but it can be a tad on the easy side (though an expansion would probably sort this issue out, not playing it enough to warrant a purchase though). Not a personal favorite but it does scratch one kind of itch.

This game had several things working against it - it's cooperative, but the players are all basically doing the same thing, so it feel more like a 1-player game with extra people added in.

Finally, I'm not a fan of the Chthulu theme necessarily, so that did nothing for me.

A thematic Dice Chucking game, it is sooo easy to explain and to et into. it is not as narrative as it could be, the theme could be exchanged to whatever, BUT, it feels like a great combination of theme + mechanic.

with too much players it could get a bit slow. Some rule variants can be used to make the game feel tighter, specially with monsters being uncovered.

After 3 solitaire plays: 
Decent game, which meets my expectations of an "Arkham Horror Light" dice game, though it can feel a little bit mechanical and repetitive as a solo game, and much of it is abstracted to the point where it doesn't have a very satisfying narrative arc, so I find myself wishing that I was playing Arkham Horror instead.
 
I can see it being more fun with 3-4 players, and I'm sure I'll get a few enjoyable games out of it.

After more plays:
I've come to be rather disappointed by this. The lack of thematic cohesion really hurts this game, and what I said earlier holds true - every time I play this I end up comparing it unfavourably with other more interesting horror-themed games and longing to play Arkham Horror, Mansions of Madness, or Betrayal at House on the Hill instead.

Yet another cooperative game. Game is fun but not as challenging as other cooperative titles like Ghost Stories or Yggdrasil where you can differ the difficulty level. Elder Sign has only one level of difficulty which is not really hard. Generally most of the games I've played were wins.

Also the mechanism of the game is very repeatable. It's generally chosing one adventure, rolling dices to solve the adventure with risk managment thanks to used objects. That's generally it. It's a simple mechanism for a simple dice game but included in 60+ minutes game and this might make the game a bit boring especially if you're lucky and there is no real threat of loosing the game.

Although the game has mentioned disadvantages, it has also one big advantage over other cooperative games as it might be played with 8 people what is a lot for cooperative game.

I am glad that I've spent 7 dollars on the ipad than 20+ dollars on the physical copy. I also know now that this game won't work with my game group. This game made my girlfriend yawn.

RATING: 3
Thoroughly, thoroughly boring. It's like a Friday night fashion show chick, great looks (theme), but after a night with it, you reveal a boring, bland, banal piece of tosh that leaves a bad taste in the mouth, even after you vomit and rinse your mouth with mustard. Unless you like games where you do nothing but roll dice, stay away from it and leave it to some other poor, hapless, impressionable sap to take it home.

This is a beautiful 1-8 player game!!  And I play single player quite a bit.

The HP Lovecraft artwork is premier and the game shines in replay due to the dice mechanic.  If you're a dice love this is a must have just like Ghost Stories.

The game is VERY reasonable in price under $30 !
There also seems to be a great potential for expansion.

Thank you Fantasy Flight.

Light and with tension at every roll, this games gets a lot of praise from me because it is the kind that my wife will never refuse to play. It is quick and cooperative, so it fills a very good niche for us. It also entices her to play multiple times in a row. A winner for us (despite the fact so many have not cared much for it).

I guess you could make plans but chances are you will fail and get frustrated. Might lose a lot especially with few players. 4 might be the ideal number. To me it's a bit of a betting game that manages to sustain the Arkham atmosphere. When you fail die rolls on a close call it feels like the monsters got you. I'm starting to like it more and more. Really nice to see how they translated the Ancient Ones from Arkham Horror into the mechanics of this game.

Wanted Eldritch Horror: The Dice Game and got it. Quicker and lighter game with a pretty different feel since. In this game you roll against adventures in the style of Age of War, you either solve the card or have to start over, while in EH you solve the mysteries a bit at a time.

Equipment and spells are single use and if you use them without gaining new stuff you will have a harder time moving forward.

Slightly fiddly, some components are VERY small.

Clever little co-op dice game, which many compare to Yahtzee. Rewarding to play, and not too taxing. Contains many elements from Arkham Horror (roaming between locations, completing adventures, battling monsters, working to a deadline when the GOO awakens), all wrapped up in a much more streamlined package, albeit not quite as rich/deep in theme.

Components are excellent, and nice to see a smaller box for a change which actually suits the volume of the contents.

A decent solitaire game. Decision-making is low. You are given many options, but not many choices. It's often pretty obvious what the best course of action is. However, dealing with the way the dice will betray you is still entertaining.

Also, the game is too easy. I have too high a win percentage to ever feel the threat of an ancient god bearing down on me.

I have the iPad version of this game and I actually prefer it. I have played the table version with 1-4 people (although it can go to 8), and we have never come close to finishing. It seems to take too long for what it offers, and can become dull pretty quickly. The Lovecraftian mood is just window dressing, unlike other games in the Arkham Horror line that really immerse you in the theme. I do find that the game improves with more players, so I will keep trying with more. However, I was a little disappointed.

What I liked about the game is the artwork, which is very good, although in majority already seen in Arkham Horror before. After first attraction it turned into dice rolling experience without any mood or challenge. The game is just too easy, and simply boring.

A good looking game, I like it more for the atmosphere (theme, components, art) than the actual game play. 
Mostly you are trying to fulfill a quest with dice rolling combinations. At least each character as a personal ability and you can get some equipment cards to manipulate the dice. At its core it is very luck driven. As such it somewhat overstays my interest.

Enjoyable but it seems that it may get boring after a couple more plays.

The idea of going to rooms and pushing your luck to try and succeed was fine and enjoyable. Yet when we played, I never once felt like we were in any risk of actually losing. Rarely someone would take a little damage or something. But it just didn't seem like we were going to have any difficulty in winning. For me that largely means I don't want to play this game as there is no real tension which makes me feel that poor rolls won't even matter as temporary losses just aren't a big issue in the game and there are so many resources to mitigate poor rolls or results anyhow. There feels like there could be a better game here, and maybe with house rules you could make the difficulty better, but as is out of the box, this game really underwhelmed me.

Fans of FFG's offerings in the Cthulu mythos games will find more to like here, and a lot of the familiar characters from those games come back with new tricks.  If Arkham Horror has become a chore to set aside the time and table space, this couldn't be a better solution.  More brief, less aimless, and still rewarding to those who play their individual turns well, and rewarding to those players with great teamwork.

This game was quite an eye opener when we first played. The theme and the layout alongside the objectives and the characters creates a real immersive game. Some say its too random with the dice. Rolling and adding bonuses to overcome monsters and spirits. Its really quite a smart design. Even the shape of the dice are pleasing to the eye. The events in the game are solid too. It has a distinct  presence of pressure that it puts onto players and really helps to create the atmosphere of fear and dread. This is an easy game to learn and the mechanics are simple enough too using cards as boosters for extra dice is a nice asset in the game. Tokens earned from successes and investigation bonuses. We cant praise this game enough. It stands out above many games because it has it all. A solid thematic experience great artwork and a storyline too. The Lovecraft horror manifestation in board games has really added a quite unique horror experience. Something that we have enjoyed. Even the kids. My 12 yr old daughter chooses this quite often as her first play.

When is Fantasy Flight going to craft a half decent rulebook? 

The seven page re-write of the rules in this game's file section on the Geek are better and more usable than the rules that come in the box, while in addition being shorter and more concise.  

Fantasy Flight: Stop making people skip around the rulebook to find the info they need. Stop burying important rules in some paragraph in a tangentially related section of the rules.


This game is not so much easy as it is really swingy.  The balance is just kind of off. I you have a little bad luck you can get really hosed, but you have to have some bad luck for the difficulty to ramp up.  If you do reasonably well rolling for what you need, you will win easily.  The more players there are, the easier things get, I feel.  

The item cards are just not thematic at all in this game. Laughably so.  I don't really care, but it just goes to show that Ameritrash games can have really pasted on themes.  

All in all, I'm kind of disappointed in this game. I was pretty psyched for a streamlined version of Arkham Horror and fun dice game.  Not sure that this game is either of those.  I'm going to need to play it a few more times to make sure how I feel about the game, but it's not looking good so far.

If you expect epic adventures, you will be sorely disappointed. "Elder Sign" is a bit meatier dice rolling game with just a touch of theme. It doesn't tell a story, but it allows you to kill a few monsters and kick the ass of some ugly Ancient God in a much shorter time than the sprawling thematic games like AH or EH. It's a fun, wild ride, maybe a bit on the easier side (at least without the expansion), but it still offers strategic choices and allows you to have fun in a cooperative game with a bunch of friends. I rate it highly for its simplicity and straightforwardness, which allows me to play it with my 5 years old daughter. All in all, a very good game for what it tries to achieve.

A fun fast alternative to Arkham Horror. Easy to setup and teach to new gamers. Great as a filler between more serious games. The artwork and components are nice. I expected all of the art to be recycled from past AH games, but that wasn't the case.

My complaints about the game-
1. It's almost entirely based around luck. There are strategic choices to make about which dice to keep, but once you're on your 2nd or 3rd game of Elder Sign, these choices are so obvious I'd hardly call it "strategy".

2. The game is too easy. There's a lot of potential to fix this with future expansions, but as of now there's just not much challenge.

Arkham Horror without the variety, the story-telling, or the fun. Elder Sign is mostly just rolling dice to see what happens.

Thanks Secret Santa 2011!

I wish there was more to this game than just rolling dice. The theme is interesting but not well integrated. For what it is, it just takes too long and doesn't seem to have much, if any, depth. Regardless, there are some people I've played with that really love it, so I'm glad someone is seeing something that I don't in this design.

Fun game.  Eerie theme as you explore a museum haunted by Cthulu and the gang.  Basically a Yatzee like game where you need to roll certain combinations in order to "defeat" rooms/tasks/monsters.  The rewards you get when you defeat a room help you defeat the Boss Monster (if he wakes up, you're in trouble).  You can use 'weapons' to get more dice to roll, you can use spells to save dice for future turns, etc...

Fun game, great theme....I introduced it to a group of my son's 16 and 17 year old friends....and they loved it.

It looks intimidating and rule-heavy at first, but Elder Sign is actually quite approachable. A lot of dice rolling, a lot of luck, very little strategy. That being said, you really feel the loss when you lose this game, but you'll have a great time doing it. It's a co-op game, but the dice rolling aspect helps prevent any quarterbacking. A pretty solid game. Good warmup, but I don't think it could support a whole game night by itself.

Was fun at first, but is way too easy. There's always a path of least resistance, and once you learn how to think the odds out and identify it, you can just ride it to the end, most of the times without even losing a single adventure. There are some options around the forums to make it harder, and we tried a couple, but frankly I don't want to put the effort into fixing a game, these things should have been figured out before it was boxed and sold.

I really wanted to like this as people would note I rate Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror highly but...nope.

The components are great but the theme takes a massive hit and as that is the main draw to these games that's a problem for me. Yes the game plays really quickly but I think the totally random nature of the dice rolls (yes its a dice game! but still) is actually more frustrating than anything else. Arkham Horror was quite well known for being random and luck based to a certain point but this game takes it to another level. 

Its not terrible, I can see why some people would like it but not for me!

The base game is too easy. The Mythos cards are quite weak and most locations are easy to beat or have no Midnight effect. Buying Elder Signs is the only valid strategy to win. Buying anything else with Trophy Points makes no sense. Needs expansions to be a fully enjoyable experience.

As a newcomer to the board game scene and a rather invested fan of Lovecraftian horror, I have been looking into something that could combine the two.  Arkham Horror was introduced to me at my FLGS, but I was certainly not prepared to take on such a difficult game.  Elder Sign proved to give that genuinely creepy feel of the Mythos and not bring me too far out of my comfort zone in terms of a learning curve.

This is my current solo game to play.

Ever play that one game of Arkham Horror that took just a bit too long. AH light this is not. This is a full game based on the HP Lovercrat Mythos setting. This game has all the elements of the AH in a perfect packaged sized game. There are definite decisions to be made in this game. Some may call it a dice fest, but I disagree. It's a probability management game. Also, I like dice so this is not an issue for me.
It probably would be a 10 for me, except there are some niggle rules that need to learned and kept in mind. 

Still, for the price, components, and fun playing time.. This game is a winner.

While I think this is a good game for what it is (essentially a simplified version of Arkham Horror), I personally would much rather play Arkham Horror. Arkham's enjoyment is really based on the theme and the simplification found in Elder Sign just doesn't carry the theme well in my opinion. The mechanics are fine, though it is frustratingly luck based, which is an issue many have with Arkham as well, but there I think the experience is immersive enough to overlook some of the frustration, here if you have a bad streak of luck it's hard not to feel as though none of your decisions matter.

For me, the Arkham Horror feel of this really worked.  I played this in a GenCon event and the guy running it sucked.  He gave us a very brief overview before he left us, never to return.  We missed out on learning about several rules that would have helped us to make progress in the game.  Even though we played the game incorrectly, I can see the potential of this game and it was still pretty fun.  I'd especially recommend it for Arkham fans who want a quick fix.

Takes the core of the board game (all those die rolls) and makes a game out of just that (game is just die rolls) resulting in a shorter game.  But has it trimmed out some of the the soul of the board game?  The game seems way to easy as the doom track never really fills up and we are getting the necessary elder signs without much trouble at all.  Is this the "fast food" drive-through of Arkham Horror?  And like fast food, likely to play this only when there is no other option or if asked by others to play.  Will change my mind if a variant pops up that increases the difficulty and adds back the impending sense of doom that is missing in our games as we play.

I've been playing Elder Sign for a while now as a kind of campaign game. Our goal: defeat ALL of the Elder Gods at least once. The catch: if an investigator dies or goes insane before we've defeated all of the gods, we remove that character from the ones available. If we run out of investigators before we defeat all of the gods, we'll lose.

I love the simplicity of Elder Sign, while still providing difficult decisions and a dark atmosphere. It's a challenging cooperative game that is rather dependant on having luck on your side. At least when things are going badly you're all suffering together?

Chance plays a big part in this game, more than I like, which is why I don't rank this higher; however, the theme is honored and the game plays quickly.

Perhaps, my enjoyment of the game will improve with more experience.

The dice are cool - I like the push your luck mechanic of choosing which adventure to go for and using special abilities to try to complete it.

Elder Sign to me is Arkham Horror light, or Arkham Horror version 2.0. I think that is a good thing.

Elder Sign is a pure dice game form of Arkham Horror. Players use dice to power everything in the game. However, the game is controlled through cards.

Elder Sign uses essentially the same game play as Arkham Horror. Players are still trying to stop an evil Ancient One from destroying the world. Players still travel to various locations to earn Elder Signs to help defeat the Ancient One. Players still earn various items to help them on their adventure. Monsters still pop up to thwart the adventures and must be dealt with.

The major difference with Elder Sign is that players use dice at the locations to accomplish pre-set tasks in a push-your-luck mechanic. Items provide players more dice to use. Accomplishing a task earns the player rewards, like Elder Signs and items, to help defeat the Ancient One. Failing a task damages the player.

I like the push-your-luck mechanic. I think it fits nicely into the Arkham Horror universe.

The artwork and components are well done.

The set-up time of Elder Sign is minimal. Full set-up takes only a few minutes. This is in contrast to Arkham horror where set-up is enormous.

Play time is also great reduced from Arkham Horror. Elder Sign can usually be set-up, played and cleaned up within an hour. 

The difficulty level of Elder Sign is a little suspect though. In fact, many would simply call the game too easy. The tasks at each location are easily beaten. Elder Signs are easy to obtain. Defeating the Ancient One is usually quick and painless. Without a strong challenge the game becomes dull and boring. However, by using a few alternate rules the difficulty level can be easily adjusted to make the game more difficult.

Here is will discuss the Elder Sign expansion [thing=137479][/thing].

Unseen Forces goes a long way toward correcting the small flaws in the base game.  It also adds a few extra pieces to help round out the game and complete the Arkham Horror feeling.

Overall, unseen Forces raises the difficulty level of the base game in many way.  Many new location cards have been added to the game effectively doubling the number of locations.  Most of these new locations are rough and greatly increase the difficulty of the game.  

New Midnight cards have been added as well.  The new Midnight cards are of extreme difficulty.  Playing with these mean almost certain doom and are only for the well seasoned player.

The entrance has changed with this expansion.  Players can no longer buy elder signs.  This helps increase the games difficulty.  New entrance abilities have been added and the players now have new options while at the entrance.

A Cursed die and Blessed die have also been added to the game.  This is a nice touch and helps round out the Arkham Horror experience.

Unseen Forces changes the base game enough to warrant a new scoring of the game.

There are too few decisions (1. Which card do I try to defeat? 2. Do I heal? or 3. Do I buy?). After that it's just dice. Normally I don't mind dice, but there has to me MORE to a game than that. 

A friend compared the phone app to a slot machine.  He meant it as a compliment, but I think it's a huge detraction - just luck of a dice roll and little more to the game. The "slot machine" comparison is just as apt in the board game itself as it is for the app.  

There is far too little interaction or collaboration for a "cooperative" game. 

Finally, it felt dry as the Atacama desert. Which is the driest desert on Earth.

I gave my copy away to someone who I sincerely hope will like it more than I did.

This game left a sour taste in my mouth for fantasy flight games.. After playing netrunner and descent 2.0 I felt relieved but this made me weary of purchases.
 
The rulebook is awful especially for such a simple game. The game feels way too long for what it is. The elder gods don't vary the game a lot. Too random for the sake of being random. The theme is strong in the components, but weak in the mechanics. The artwork and components are nice (would have liked a larger box with bags or a halfway decent insert).

If this game was 30 minutes it would be an OK filler.

One play.  It was on ok dice rolling coop, but nothing special, and it went on far too long - almost twice what we'd expected - we just got to the stage where we couldn't do any of the challenges, and it stalled badly mid-game as a result.

RATING: 3
It feels like the only real decision you make in this game is which location to go, and once you do that you just have to roll the dice and hope you match everything that's on that card's location, sometimes spending an item or clue to add a die or reroll.

As a result, the game feels less interesting than the Yahtzee game it got its dice mechanics from (since you could at least decide on different things to go after based on what you rolled), but has this lack of agency hidden behind all this extra rules and cruft in the name of making the game seem cool and thematic.

I'd much rather play a game like King of Tokyo where you can actually go for different results that are all viable, then this 'roll the dice and hope it matches' garbage. I've given this game a chance twice now, had really poor experiences both times, and I doubt I'll give it another.

[q=""]I don't think the intent was to allow the piling of all spare monsters on a useless adventure.[/q]

Only played it once, but if you have an investigator with a high stamina, if you pile the monsters on an adventure that has a single stamina penalty, you can essentially use the monster pile to get trophies. I found this useful when the other adventures had a sanity penalty, and my investigator was down to one sanity.

Also, if you pile monsters onto an adventure and don't clean them out, that increases the chances of the Warlock, who freezes a red die (and returns to the cup when defeated), of coming out. So I think the design is that you must eventually clear out the monsters. How soon is up to you.

Fun game. Given my like for anything Lovcraftian, this game is a hit. After a few plays I understand why people called it Arkham Horror light.  Lots of dice rolling, make this game heavy on luck and a crapshoot to win, but the luck kinda adds to the theme, you never know how things will turn out, and that's very Lovecraft.  It's fun, but I don't know how often this will hit the table.

Not really that interesting, which is unfortunate.

I know it's no more random than Arkham Horror, but it just feels as though my play is basically programmed, and then dependent solely upon the results of multiple dice. I get that I can add additional dice, or modify rolls, but for the most part, I wouldn't play this.

I really enjoyed this, although some of the rule/card combo fuzziness did begin to bug me a little. If I do ever sell my ridiculous Arkham Horror collection (ridiculous in that it is almostunplayed, I think I am mostly hanging on to it in the vague hope that my kids will love it in about 8 to 10 years time), then I'll probably get this to have some of the flavour in a neat little package. As I still have Arkham though, I find that the phone app is enough to satisfy the occassional urge to play. Nice dice, and a neat little package. Fun solo, don't know if i'd really enjoy the cooperative mode. 

I sold my ridiculous Arkham collection. This fills the niche, and saves the shelf space.

Works perfect as a solo game.

Tentative rating based upon one play.

Not the best circumstances - weirdly, my copy came with the tarot-sized cards from the "Unseen Forces" and not from the base game so it wasn't all totally functional.

I need to give this another try once (hopefully) I get a replacement deck with the tarot-sized cards from the base game.

See symbols in rows, roll dice, if dice match symbol in one row, place dice, if not lose one die and re-roll (too bad if you match all symbols in one roll, the game forces a re-roll per row).

Sometimes you make it (get cards/tokens to help move towards the game end), sometimes you don't (get bored, pass dice, wait a seemingly interminable age for them to come round again).

I've no idea why this is a game, there's just nothing to it, it's not even push-your-luck, rather do-or-do-not as there is no decision making going on.

Production is excellent but overly fiddly, the theme is such a paste job I could only smell the glue, not the fear.

Played twice (with months between plays), just to confirm my first impressions, I won't be playing a third.

This is a great game, my wife and I love to play this one together.  We use this as a weeknight game since it isn't too long.

I've heard this game called Cthulhu Yahtzee.

This game is so much more than that. It's a thematic, dice drama filled and special powers fest of a good time. Yes the Cthulhu thing can be over played but try this game out. It's coo-operative and easy to teach. This hits my table quite a bit. Hey, if I'm bored I can play this beast solo. Take that squid-face. 

Certainly worth your time and monies.

8.11.11 - (3 solo plays) I like the setting a lot. The production values are very nice for this game. The game is way too long though. I just don't have that much desire to play it again. I'd probably buy this if it played in 60 minutes.

5.5.13 - (8 plays) I like this game more for its components, artwork, and theme than I do for its game play. It really is a great looking game but I don't get enthusiastic about playing it. Bought my copy when the expansion was announced and not sure now if I want to keep the base game or even get the expansion when it comes out. On top of that I really don't enjoy co-op games, though I do want to have one in my collection. I guess I'll keep it until I find a better co-op.

This is a good little game, and the iOS version is amazing.  If you're interested in the board game, I'd recommend Arkham horror.  It's barely longer (30 mins) and the theme suffers in this version.  If you're a completist and Cthuluhu fan, you were going to buy this anyway.

RATING: 5
I have to check the rules to ensure we played everything right, because it was so damn easy. If cooperative games are the kiss of death, then easy co-ops are like kissing your sister in death.

This game made me think more about Arkham Horror than Elder Sign, because it's totally what I think Arkham Horror is (move around, roll dice, read cards, curse luck). It works here, and not in Arkham, because it doesn't pretend to be more than what it is. Doesn't hurt that there is much denser strategic value here (both because the dice-rolling decisions matter more here and because it's a much shorter game).

It's streamlined, but for the better. If nothing, the shorter game-time allows you to take a more leisurely pace and smell the roses with the flavor text and narrative, instead of needing to rush Arkham or having the game bog down.

Downtime in a co-op is a major downer, especially since there's nearly nothing you can do game-wise when it's not your turn. Want to play with fewer so there's less downtime and you can impact the game more, but seems like the difficulty goes even lower with fewer players because everybody gets more turns and levels up into a badass (though I guess it's easier to get killed if you have more turns). 

3+2

I still haven't played it live, but playing it on the iPhone has been a treat.  I wasn't sure I would like the abstraction of the items and spells into dice, but if you don't have time to break out your entire Arkham Horror set, this is a great little alternative.  I'm not a big fan of co-op games due to the alpha factor, but this is not a game that suffers from that.  I wouldn't want to play with more than 4, though.

Finally got to play this live and I have to agree with most of the folks on here that say it comes off as a bit too easy.  On the iPhone, I am usually pushed to the limit, but live, it was an easy win over Azathoth.  I agree that it might have something to do with the results on the mythos cards not being distributed well enough.  I think they should either release a re-worked mythos deck or tell us what to pull out to re-balance the deck.

A fun game which is really a dice rolling combat version of Mansions of Madness. Although the dice rolling make it look like a game based on pure chance, it is not. It is quite tactical in the way that you have to plan your actions in order to make sure you're able to achieve the quests. Player cooperation is key in this, as the clock is ticking and the coming of evil is approaching.

Ha. FFG's first attempt to make 3-3.5 hour Arhkam Horror streamlined and shorter. And they managed it with a filler type game. That only takes 1.5 hours! Uhm... Yeah, kinda long for what it is. What it is, is taking Knizia's mechanism from Risk Express and meshing it with a sorta kinda adventure game. Only there's no adventure to be had, we couldn't create any atmosphere no matter how we tried, we read flavour text out loud to see if we can create some narrative, but it's impossible. Flavour text is boring, meaningless and because of bad font choice unreadable. While it's admirable how they manage to reinterpret AH's rules in a new way the result didn't really do what it was promising too. They cut too much of it. So their second attempt, Eldrich Horror was a huge success because it cut 3-3.5 hour AH to 2.5-3 hours. Whee! But they did keep the murky browny baroque and barely readable graphic design for their entire Mythos line of games.

Typical fiddly FFG chrome and bits.

Lovecraft fans will be all over this like an Ancient One over the investigators.

Players have different abilities and equipment and are racing against the clock to stop an Ancient One from destroying the earth. How? By finder Elder Signs. What's that? It's a reward you might find by completing quests. Quest themselves are yahtzee-like. Roll dice to match symbols. You have equipment that allow rerolls, locking in dice, etc.

The iOS and Android version of the game is prefect for solitaire and saves the hassle of set up.

Upon opening the box, I thought "wow this game looks cool! Wait, what's with this insert (or lack thereof)?". Oh, and that rule book--just throw it out. It's probably worded in the most complex way possible; we found a revised .pdf of the game and printed that out instead and it even incorporated a quick reference for things (which is what one would expect in a rule book!) Elder Sign is a really cool looking game, with an interesting design, but was an absolute NIGHTMARE to try to organize back into the box. Not just a nightmare--it's impossible. We had to purchase a tackle box to store all the pointless little health and sanity tokens. There seems to be a lot of unnecessary small little cardboard pieces that are a pain to store and easy to lose. We switched out the health and sanity with blue and red d10's as that was much easier than all the tokens. There's a lot of dice rolling, and considering that dice are random, there's a lot of ways in which you can change your results. There's not a lot of strategy behind the game, it's pretty light considering how complex it appears.

A nice filler.  A bit too easy sometimes without some house rules, but it's a fun game to at least lightly scratch the Arkham Horror itch when play time is limited.  Also much more portable.  

I also have Elder Sign: Omens for my phone, and while they are similar, there's something about playing this one with multiple players that give it a little extra oomph.

When you win Elder Sign, you are really happy and a little spent, because it was an uphill battle long before you even got the box out. Maybe a little too much reliance on luck vs. skill, but it's a dice rolling game, so what else can you do?

I feel like Elder Sign is a complex gateway game. This is the game you use after introducing a person to the boardgame hobby with something like Ticket to Ride or Smallworld. When you want to teach people to play Arkham Horror, I highly suggest playing Elder Signs with them first. I think it will increase their appreciation of Arkham Horror despite its downsides. Also it is just a great co-op game in it's own right.

Love it! This game is perfect for those of us without the patience or time to learn/set up Arkham Horror or Eldritch Horror. It's a creepy and fun cooperative game. You do NOT need to be a fan of Lovecraft to enjoy it, so don't let the Cthulhu theme stop you from grabbing a copy.

This game was pretty fun, I can see with more players the monsters may be easier to kill. But I am not sure, either way the game was fun and has a pretty good luck factor with it. There are cards that help amp up your rolls by adding dice. Fun game, would like to play some more with less players to see if the difficulty changes.

I suppose Elder Sign could be considered Arkham Horror: The Dice Game. However, the game isn't really that difficult nor is it very thematic. The game supports one to a ridiculous eight players, but I'll never go past four. As with any Fantasy Flight production, the quality is good and there are stacks of cards and bits every where. Unfortunately, in true FFG fashion, the rule book is a mess with several rules exceptions not explained very clearly. Overall, the game is fun, but it can also last awhile. If I'm going to play this game now, it's going to be with the Gates of Arkham expansion. That is how this game should have been released to begin with. However, I can't bring myself to go through setting up this game and remembering all the rules exceptions. I'd rather just play something else.

I really like Arkham Horror but every time someone asks me to play it I kind of sigh because the setup and play length always feel overwhelming. Elder Signs is not really Arkham Jr. but it does seem to appeal to me for the same reasons but plays MUCH more quickly. I'm sure I'll still play Arkham from time to time, but Elder Signs will certainly be hitting the table a lot more...

Lovecraft-themed game with simple Yahtzee-like mechanics.  Not too difficult to teach to new players.  Constant threats on the board make this tactically interesting.  My main criticism is that this game plateaus once players have determined the min maxing strategies that optimize chances of success.  While the board often demonstrates tactical threats, we are rarely threatened by the Elder God's Doom track.  I would prefer to be challenged by the Elder God more frequently.

Elder Signs works exceptionally well as an Arkham Horror light. It has a lot of the same fell and same characters ;)

I love Lovecraftian games and this is no exception. Plays well both in this analog edition and in the digital iPad edition. Two thumps up to Fantasy Flight!

Update: After playing this a LOT with both gamers and non-gamers young and old I've upped this to a 10!! It is really a great dice/board/cardgame combo ;)

Unsure about this one. When we started, we didn't have a "clue" how to play. With seven players there was significant downtime for a dice game. May adjust rating after a second play. Does not implement the theme nearly as good as Arkham Horror.  And isn't that what Lovecraft games are about anyway?

RATING: 7.5
It's quite fun, but i don't like it at higher player counts at all - can get very long and boring that way. Actually i think my favorite is as either a two player, or solo game. There are some really fun decisions to make (some are press-your-luck type decisions) and the dice rolling mechanic is pretty cool. For sure not a substitute for Arkham Horror, but most people know that already. I think in the end what keeps me from wanting to play it a great deal is that although the artwork is VERY thematic, the game play is not, IMO. So, i really do feel like im playing a yatzee-type game, as opposed to playing the role of a character in a Cthulhu-world. 

Ill say this though - it is a STUPENDOUS! phone app.

With all the components to keep track of this feels a little over complicated, however still found this a nice little game that can be played in less than an hour, good for mythos fans too, the theme worked nicely for me. Although I found solo play made the game a little tricky, the addition of even a second player seemed to make it significantly easier.

Not really a pick up game, but once you're familiar with the rules it makes a nice little filler.

Just didn't really feel this that much. The dice are cool, and the artwork is great, but the individual quests are crazy difficult, and had it not been for a key weakness in the end creature, there is no way we would have won.

I'm a big fan of Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos, and the game is nicely produced and some fun, but still too much like 'co-op Cthulhu Yahtzee' for me.

I was disappointed, but lots of people really like it!

This is a game I really really wanted to be great and got me very excited, and I had the same excitement with Castle Ravenloft.  Unfortunately at this stage it is looking like this will be another CR, a grand opportunity for a great game gone begging.   I will persist with it a little longer.

My favorite feature of this game compared to other cooperative adventure games is the amount of variety it offers.  There are 16 different characters to choose from, each with different abilities and starting inventories.  This adds a lot of variety and replay value along with the randomly selected rooms each with different goals, rewards, and punishments for failure.

Of course with such a large selection of characters some certainly outshine others, but I personally like the imbalance.  I think a game like this should draw comments like "Yes, I got Mr. X" or "Crap, Mister Z again..."  It encourages new lines of thinking and strategies in order to win a game, that like most cooperative adventure games, isn't exactly easy.

This is the game that I had hoped Arkham Horror would be.  Elder Sign is a great co-op game for 1 to 8.  

I've never read a Lovecraft book but I know of the series and I really like the concept of this game.  The art work fantastic and the quality of the cards is great.  

I find Elder Sign to be a much more streamlined and less clunky version of Arkham Horror.  The game board is replaced by card that represent rooms in a museum. This get rid or monster movement and a couple other things. You don't gather clues in Elder Sign, you roll dice to compete tasks.  The cards for rooms have results that happen if you complete the task or fail.

I don't think of Elder Sign as Arkham Horror light, it is just better.  By better I mean, more streamlined and polished.  By no mean is any easier to win at, but it sure easier to teach others how to play.

The game is still quite the challenge and you will probably loose more than you win.  The great thing is that when we do win, it feels like a quality win and we worked to get it.  Once in awhile you'll get an easy win, the dice will just hit for you.   

I'm finding the game play and mechanics to be very solid.  Teaching others to play this has been easy thus far.  Game play can go from 20 minutes to an hour + in my experience thus far.  And I find it play solo just fine.  

This is a game I find myself wanting to play.

First game it happened that I lost first battle and then had some bad rolls after again. Therefore I played like five rounds and couldn't do much. Others decided the game.
This was quite boring.

Second game I got a better start. Then I enjoyed the game.

My recommendation would be if you have a bad start and lost your equipment without winning a battle, go for the risk either you win and catch up or you die and get a second character with equipment again. Otherwise you playing many rounds just to slowly catch up and finally the game is over.

Horrible, awful, TERRIBLE rulebook.  Game required a 6 page FAQ which changed at least 10%, if not more, of the rulebook while adding in its own share of new tweaks.

More egregiously, it didn't even fix the fundamental problem:  the game is piss-easy.  There's just no horror or interest in rolling dice to complete tasks.  Even the ones that are supposed to be difficult can usually be completed with maybe at most one failure.  I'm not sure if this was just because we rolled really well or if the Law of Averages doesn't work with this few trials, but after 5 games you would think we would have lost at least once.  The closest we ever came was 6 out of 12 Doom tokens on the Ancient One's track.  Boring...

EDIT: I finally played this again over four years later and I actually found it rather enjoyable. It was still easy, but I think I was too harsh on it back when I first rated it. Raised to a 6 for now with a pot ethical increase if I continue enjoying it.

It goes just a little too long, and if your individual character is weaker than others, you may not like feeling like a supporting character. However, it's a solid introductory game to both cooperative games and the Cthulhu mythos. Personally I don't generally care for the Cthulhu theme, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the game.

I really enjoy this game, and need to play it more often.  For me, this is a great way to get my Lovecraftian fix when I don't have the time and space (no puns intended) for it's big brother, Arkham Horror.

People who say that this is Yhatzee with a fancy paint job are missing the point.  Like most thematic games, you get out of it what you put into it.

Traded into FLGS for store credit. Not a big fan of Cthulhu theme.  A bit long and fiddly for my solo play tastes. Not sure if I even played with the correct rules?

Update: iOS version is great and now I'm addicted to this game - iOS version is a solid 7!

RATING: 7
My daughter (8yo) and I had a lot of fun playing this this weekend! With her real flair for the dramatic, she loved reading all the flavor text out loud, which really did help improve the atmosphere and therefor the theme while we played.  She's looking forward to trying out some other characters now.

As far as the game goes, it is a typical co-op, which fans love to deny, but is literally just rolling dice on a spreadsheet and applying various thematic modifiers.  But therein lies the fun--all those little modifiers which play to and adjust the spreadsheet, in FFG are HIGHLY thematic.  Trust me, no one wants to see a Knizia version of these things!  Elder sign, for such a simple game, is simply rolling in theme.

The board game version is quite a bit easier than the quite difficult (played with random investigators anyway) iPad game.  There is plenty of room for both in my collection though because quite honestly, my daughter wouldn't put up with the win/loss ratio on the ipad.  plus all the tactile movement of the bits, along with the great flavor text and greater variation makes the boardgame version the real winner, even though the ipad version will do in a pinch.

Elder Sign is a great way to introduce H. P. Lovecraft-type games to newcomers. The difficulty level and chances of success against the Ancient Ones are a bit easier than similar games, such as Mansions of Madness, Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror, etc.

Coop game with barely any cooperation.
Rich theme pasted on.
Elaborated rules with Yahtzee gameplay.
Even on mobile I feel the game is too long and repetitive. Can't imagine what it's like to suffer the real thing.

Only on BGG can this game be in the top 500. Funny how most rating above 7 are given by Americans and rating below 5 by Europeans. A nice showing of the amerithrash/euro cleavage.

Originally rated it a 7. It grew on me and has had quite a few plays now. Some combinations of baddies and investigators are harder than others. The inverse is also true and in those cases can skew much too easy. I haven't played the expansion but look forward to it for the added bits. It can play up to 8 but I don't think I'd ever want to do more than 4. By that point it's about the limit I'd want to wait between turns.

Besides the theme, this game basically feels like Yahtzee.  The theme doesn't do much for me so I think I would rather just play Yahtzee.  Yahtzee definitely has less down time and feels somewhat more strategic instead of all tactical.  Just not my type of game I guess.

RATING: 6.5
Ok, this is not exceptional game. There is a lot of dice rolling, only a few very shallow decisions based on evaluation of the statistical chance to win, a few small optimizations and things to remember and great amount of luck. I would give it 6 or something. But visuals, theme, pictures, setting, the game oozes with Mythos. And despite its drawback it is still quite playable. So, maybe it is not true eight and maybe it won't survive in my collection forever, but hey, I like it.

Edit: After a few plays I found the decisions are lacking too much. First impression is very good, but I miss some depth. Thus, rating lowered to 7 (what is still not so bad).

Edit: Time passes, rating goes to 6.5 and it is time to say good bye. Theme, setting, atmosphere is great, but it is not enough. So, I was right â 6 or something :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fails miserably on the rules vs depth scale.  Your decisions aren't very interesting, but there are lots of little rules to remember or look up about how things might interact.  Cooperation isn't very interesting, and luck is a much bigger factor than anything else.  It's fun enough to roll the dice and see what happens, and the art is fine, but it felt pretty long for what it is.

Still unsure about this one. The game seems fun, but the dice mechanic is ultimately frustrating. Sometimes there is no option on the board for a way out. 2 games and 2 complete disasters, with both games ending in combat with the Great Old One. Here is hoping that in a few games time I'll be more hooked.
Update - finally beat it when I realised I was playing a rule wrong, which with this rulebook is very easy to do. The game is a mess. I traded it for Fjords in October 2012.

RATING: 4
Initially, the prospect of a lighter Arkham Horror style experience that played in under an hour was one that massively appealed to me. However, I found Elder Sign to be far too easy (at least in it's vanilla form - I haven't tried any expansions). After several plays and no losses it became clear that this game wasn't going to provide the challenge of Arkham Horror. Also, the decisions are pretty alogorithmic as it's usually transparent which mission you have the most chance of completing before you roll the dice. Sold away.

Picked this up in a math trade.  I have been curious about Arkham Horror but I know that it's long playtime would not be a good fit with my family.

After a couple of plays I decided to put it up in a math trade.  I just couldn't get immersed in the theme of the game.  I wanted to feel like an investigator desperately working to save the world.  Instead I just felt like a guy rolling dice.

I have a lot of coop games that I want to play more and I am not that interested in the theme with the mechanics included in this game.


Update:  I re-acquired the game after reading so much about it on the People's Choice top 100 solo games.  I wanted to try it again and I have been enjoying it more than the first few games I had.

Mostly mindless die rolling. Fun, but too long for what it is. Something to pull out occasionally.
+co-op+

House Rules:
Speedy Signs
Investigation

* You'll need either a normal six sided die (or a few stray tokens, but I'll assume the use of a die) to track the team's Investigation score.
* When a player gains Trophies, either by completing an adventure or defeating a monster, keep the card/token as normal, but also add the trophy value to the Investigation score.
* When the Investigation score reaches 5 or more, the team automatically gains 1 Elder Sign and loses 5 investigation.
So if you had 4 Investigation and completed an adventure worth 2 trophies, you would gain 1 Elder Sign and have 1 Investigation left.
Faster Threat
* The bad new is, the threat grows much faster. When the clock strikes Midnight or 6 o'clock, add a Doom token to the Doom track.
The Museum Lobby
* When you visit the Lobby, you can take 3 actions there. Take them one at a time. You can take the same action multiple times if you want. For example, you could heal 3 sanity for free as your entire visit. Or buy 3 common items. Or visit the Lost and Found, go heal the sanity you lost for free, and then buy a common item.
* However, you CANNOT buy Elder Signs at the Lobby.
--------------------------------
Partial Binding - A Speedy Final Battle Variant
This variant is completely unconnected to the variant above. It can be used with or without it. It is less tested than the above variant, since usually the GOO doesn't wake up!
If the GOO awakens, the team loses Elder Signs equal to 1/2 the total required to Seal the GOO, rounded up. (For example, it takes 13 Elder Signs to seal Cthulhu, so you lose 6 Elder Signs if Cthulhu awakens).
If you don't have enough Elder Signs to suffer the loss, you lose immediately - your defenses are insufficient to even attempt the final battle!
If you have any Elder Signs leftover, each Sign removes 1 Doom token from the GOO before the battle begins.
However, the GOO attacks at both midnight and 6 o' clock.

The Cthulhu Mythos is daunting to the uninitiated, and games that bring it to life can be even more so.  Elder Sign ditches the complex game play in favor of immersing you in the maddening world of the Ancient Ones with a handful of dice as your only weapon. Enjoy the ride!

This one is hard to rate. The game is for me a filler game or something to mostly play with non-gamers. As that I would rate it high. As a proper game though it might have too few decisions. In a co-op game I am used to losing more than winning at first. That was not the case in this game.

Ryan's Rank (3/15) â 3.5 out of 5. This game made me tense! It was well balanced in regards to difficulty and well themed. A pretty fun game, though I doubt it will hit the table often.

This game is sort of like a simplified dice version of Arkham Horror.  Trying to defeat the bad guy and conqueror all the various rooms is a challenge when factoring in the randomness of dice rolling.  Although it is a co-op game, the players really don't help each other a whole lot despite trying to achieve the same goal of defeating the BBG.  Still I would much rather play this simplified version in an hour than the full blown game of Arkham Horror which can take 3 to 4 hours.

I have a love/hate realtionship with this game.

Sometimes it is really great and I love it. And sometimes it is boring. 

The amount of randomness in the game make for a swingy experience. If you get easy adventure cards, no nasty midnight effects,powerful items and lucky dice throws, the game will be a breeze and boring.

On the other hand, if you get hard adventure cards, harsh mythos effects, lots of monsters, terror and at midnight effects, poor equipment and unlucky dice results, the game is frustrating and unfun. 

But when the stars align just right, it provides a tense experience, with some push you luck element. Do you go for an easy cards, at the risk of losing time before the goo awakens, or do you go for elder signs, at the risk of failing miserably. Do you keep your items for extreme situations, or do you spend them now to insure easy success. 

That is the kind of decision that this game offers.

As usual with FFG, you'll get lots of deck of cards, lots of chits, temporary effects that change from turn to turn that you have to remember applying, etc. But it's much less severe than in games such as Arkham Horror.

There are many complaints about the game being to easy. But I disagree. It just depends on many many things. Sometimes it is too easy, sometimes it is too hard, sometimes it is just fine. 

I suppose it also depends on how you play the game. If you play it as a highly strategic game, doing easy adventures to get tons of loot before tackling difficult adventures, I can see the game as too easy and unfun. But if you treat it as a push your luck game, taking risks on every turn, it is a much better game. Question is: do you play to win, or to enjoy the game?

As in Arkham Horror, I dislike the fight against the goo if he wakes up. Then it just becomes roll roll roll roll, apply goo battle effect, roll, roll, roll, roll, apply goo battle effect, until you win or you die. 

I have played with the expansion only once so not much to say about it yet.

I enjoy this game quite a lot.  The base rules can sometimes lean towards easier scenarios, but they can still pose a challenge if things go down in the right order (from the board's perspective).  If you add some of the houserules that are out there the game gets more difficult, which can be fun in an experienced group.  Either way this game is a relatively quick and fun play

For a co-op game, and for a game set in this dark atmosphere, the game doesn't deliver a whole lot of suspense or dread.  Maybe I just need to mentally "get" it.  It is fun to plan a little and take risks now and then, and the final couple of adventures taken on to get the last few Elder Signs are fairly exciting. So while there is some supsense at the end when the Ancient One is close to waking, it seems there isn't as much throughout the rest of the game.  This is unlike a game like Pandemic, where you could be battling hot zones with tons of potential outbreak problems from the very first turn.

Nice, but not great. There is significantly less immersion than in Arkham Horror, as there is no need at all to read the text on the cards (and if you do, they don't make a whole lot of sense).

Arkham Horror meets Yahtzee.  Nice for a quick fix of that Lovecraft theme, though the app does it with less setup and cleanup!  Unfortunately just like Arkham it sometimes feels like it overstays its welcome.  The downtime between turns can be just as significant here as it is with Arkham.

Includes Unseen Forces and Gates of Arkham expansions.

Bought this one on Android. Port is really well done.
About this game, I would say it's fun, and has some strategy, but in the end it's still a bit too random for me. Yathzee lovers will probably like this one.

Thematic is also well implemented.

To sum up, it's a small, well-thought game, with light strategy and sometime too much luck-dependant (with way to mitigate this tho).

We've really enjoyed Elder Sign, though it's yet to put up a real stiff challenge yet. Solid co-op; low alpha-gamer suffrage. Best choice for us to get the Arkham theme when we don't have time for Eldritch Horror.

RATING: 7.5
What a shame. This is so great in many ways. Some very clever mechanics making it an original take on the Yatzhee stable, yet as everyone says, it is just too darned easy.
I so want to love this more, and I'm pretty sure there's some home-brewed ways of making it work, but it seems such a shame considering it's so well-produced to have to tinker about with it. Gonna search for fixes and rating might go up or down. from it's initial 6.5
**Edit** ahh the expansion seems to fix it. Played once and this time the elder actually appeared. Fairly easy to beat him up after that though and it was Cthulhu himself! But more enjoyable game leading up to it. Rating changed to 7.5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elder Sign is actually a remarkably fun game, though I'm aware that it has somewhat of a poor reputation. There is a lot of great atmosphere and tension here, as well as tons of different things going on at once which gives it an adventurous vibe. Yes, it can be quite easy, and yes, it's essentially a dice-rolling game, but I don't really mind this very much. My biggest con with the game is actually the fiddliness--too many small components to keep up with makes set-up and break-down quite tedious. If you're looking for strategy, this is definitely not your pick. If, however, you're just looking for some fun, Elder Sign is something you might enjoy. It's all in how you approach it.

Elder Sign is a well-produced dice game that should appeal to Lovecraft fans. The designers have added their own quirk which stutters the dice-rolling a bit, but the real issue with Elder Sign is downtime.  Each player gets lots of cards to read, plenty of chits to handle, and many modifiers to pick from.  The result is fiddly and wearisome.  Elder Sign is a strong addition to the franchise, but ordinary dice lovers should try before they buy.

I usually like dice games, but this was an exception.  It feels like a puzzle game except you never have the pieces you need.  There are ways to get extra dice and rerolls, but it's not uncommon that you reroll the die several times and the right combination of symbols never comes up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A first solo testrun and the game seems promising. Not much diverse effects with all the common items, unique items (which aren't that unique after all) and the spells, but where else to start if you want to boil Arkham Horror down into 1-2 hours? And that's something the designers succeded in. Almost all the flavor's still here and the game's balance was great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really enjoy co-op games and this, while maybe a little easy, holds up. Thematics are true to  the Lovecraft mythos. Also, I think the game is a little more difficult if there is a 'one and done' rule when your adventurer is devoured.

This is definitely one of my pet games.  While technically it is not a remarkable game, that doesn't mean it fails to entertain.  The first session my group of complaining and nobody could figure out what was going on.

It frequently gets requested on game night.

An interesting dice game but it lacks the tension I look for in a co-op and the theme is entirely transparent. If looking to increase the difficulty you can try playing that you lose if the GOO wakes up and that you have to win a final battle at the GOO's current doom track value after getting the required number of seals. This brings the challenge level closer to Arkham Horror.

Very lazy work on the item deck as well, very disappointed with that aspect of the game.

People talk about this like it's Arkham Horror streamlined... I'd say Arkham Horror light. Yes, it's simpler, faster, easier to learn, master, and teach... but that's only good if all that was cut was flak. Personally, I think Elder Sign excised all the BEST parts of Arkham Horror.. It can't feel like a story the way AH does, the sense of narrative is just really shallow in comparison. I won't say theres no fun, it's satisfying to play and win... but I suggest Arkham Horror (or something else entirely).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I prefer this as a single-player game.  Most Lovecraft stories only have one protagonist anyway, so it helps me to build a narrative out of so many apparently unrelated pieces.  

As written, it's too easy, so I use the following house rules:
1. Four hours per investigator turn.
2. No purchasing Elder Signs.
3. Get devoured, you're out.

While the setup for this one can be daunting,  Elder Sign is a fun dice roller that offers a fair bit of challenge. 

Because there are so many variables, every game is not an epic experience.  It is not due to a flaw in the game's design,  rather it is the nature of the beast in this type of game.  Speaking of the game's design,  it is well crafted and comprehensive.  Much attention was paid to detail and as a result,  the game's potential is fully realized.

As far as co-op's are concerned,  I find this an exceptional effort that,  for the most part,  gets everything right.

Very solid and fun co-op dice chucker. The dice rolls help take away any sort of alpha gamer problems as really who can predict dice rolls? and you have to take risks and get a bit lucky to win anyway. There's plenty of variety straight out of the box too with plenty of investigators and great old ones. I don't love Chthulu as a theme but this game is really suited to it and complements it throughout. Very Enjoyable.

I enjoy the Lovecraft them for games, and I like the weight of Elder Signs. The die rolling can mean that you get stuck at times, but it's not too difficult to learn how to play. I will say that there are some rules that need to be written a little bit more explicitly in the rule book, but otherwise it's really nice. I like the co-op aspect of the game and the variable player powers. It plays pretty differently every time and is tough to win.

All around great game though and satisfies that Lovecraft itch in a much faster time frame than Arkham Horror.

A fun game with light strategy and moderate luck.  My 7 year old can play it but it's also fun for a group of adults.  Games can last from 40 mins to 1.5 hours (one game lasted 2.5 hours) so that keeps me from playing it as often as I would other games but it is fairly easy to teach new players as long as someone has played it before.

Update: After about 15 plays I found it to get tedious.  It's still okay to play with non competitive people but I have yet to lose.  Since the main mechanic is dice rolling it may be more luck than anything but it still fails to keep my interests.

Great at what it tries to do- that is condense the key mechanisms of Arkham Horror into a much quicker and streamlined game. Avoids the 'annoying leader' sydrome that co-ops can suffer from by providing enough locations and randomness that you are never sure what the best move will be. 

The theme doesn't suck you in as much as in Arkham Horror. Good story telling takes time, and Elder Sign has clearly sacrificed the story telling aspect by going for a fast experience. 

I really like it.

Elder Sign is a great way to experience "Arkham Light."  The rules are simple, the play is quick, and the deaths are just as agonizing as any other Arkham game ;)

The best thing I can say about this game is the components... the has got to be one of the all-time best looking games for the $.  The cards are gorgeous, the bits are nice, and the theme is dripping.  Wonderful artwork.

Well, after a couple of plays I say this: is a good game, but is not (and shouldn't be anyway) an Arkham Horror lite.

Sure, is has some theme, but not that much. The flavor text was left to a minimum, with even the personal stories of the investigators gone.

The game plays in a medium-fast way - normally three or four rolls of dices and it is the next one turn. So even for 5 or more playes, the downtime isn't a major issue.

I liked it, but I don't love it. Arkham Horror, you're my main mythos love still! :)

RATING: 4
Abstract and luck-dependent. Partly because it's cooperative, it lacks narrative and room to do things that feel clever. Most of your "decisions" are really probability assessments better left to a computer.

It makes me admire a bit more the implementation of dice in Ghost Stories: There if you need an improbable die roll in order to make progress, chances are you can do something more useful with your turn than attempt that die roll.

The options in Ghost Stories' dilemmas also feel qualitatively different as their implications are usually too complicated to reduce to probability math.

My second play was comically stagnant. The situation on the board just happened to be so hopeless that three of us managed to burn through most of the 16 characters trying to get anywhere at all.

...I've been choosing to "watch" rather than play when this comes out. So dull and annoying.

I think of this game as "Arkham Horror the Card Game". I love its small size and huge play. There is a lot of cooperative gaming for such a small package. Bits and theme are outstanding and the game is not a walk in the park. You really have to take some chances to walk away without having given up the universe to the ancient ones.

Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.

Brilliant, tense and surprisingly dense small box game. Designed almost as 'Arkham Horror - the dice game' it actually stands up perfectly well in it own right and has plenty of unique mechanics to set it apart from its bigger relatives. Very tough to beat, and at times you will almost start to believe that dark forces are controlling the very dice themselves as you'll often find yourself just one roll short of a room victory, and will often catch yourself saying "Ackk, if only they'd rolled like that last go!" Excellent game and great value for money. Packs a lot in a small box.

RATING: 8
Beautiful, push-your-luck dice-rolling game. Played it many times and loved the cooperative component. Tends to be very atmospheric, bad things will happen and luck is a fickle lady. Quite a lot of play-throughs ended with everything hanging off the last attempt at finishing an adventure - as in - if Matej manages to solve this one and get the last Elder Sign, we have won. If he loses, the BigBad awakens and the world is lost. Even though some play-throughs were a bit on the easy side when the dice-chucking was particularly lucky (which the game easily mitigates with moving the clock faster) , it mostly ended up being quite close. The BigBad was defeated, but only half of the investigators surviving and close to death/insanity.
I had considered giving it 7/10 because I don't like that much randomness in a game, but decided to give it 8/10 just because of the wonderful art and enjoyable atmosphere of Lovecraftian Mythos.

Even though I am not a big fan of co-op games, especially when they are easy to beat (limiting replayability even further), I really enjoy Elder Sign. Why? Because it has to be one of the cleanest FFG designs in existence (short manual, only a small amount of text on the cards), and it plays like a dice game that is more involved than most and oozes with theme. However, I do feel that the game requires more luck than co-op skill. Games are mostly too easy, sometimes much too hard, depending on which Mythos cards and monsters come out. Still, a relaxing game and fun to play medium filler.

Sure the Dice are random but you can build a process to manipulate the dice in a fashion that really brings in the investigative side of Arkham and adds quite a bit of 'feel' to the game. I'm liking it.

It's a fun dice fest, and my 4p group actually had a pretty hard time beating our first game of this due to awful dice rolls. Every other game I've played has had the GOO not even close to waking up.

-UPDATE- Played a 3p game the other night and while it was pretty close it just wasn't really fun. It felt more like work than playing a good game and I found myself just waiting for it to be over by the time we had half the required Elder Signs. Brought it down a point as a result, we'll see how it fares after a few more plays.

-MORE UPDATE-
The more I look back on this game the less I like it especially now that I've played Eldritch Horror. If I can't find a trade for it I might give it another try eventually but for now it's a dud.

It's not a terrible game, but not one that I wanted to keep around to play. It's a lot of setup and mucking about for what is, ultimately, roll-roll-roll-yay/boo. The art is there, sure, but I couldn't connect with the theme.

If I'd realized that it was available as Elder Sign: Omens on my phone for $4, I probably wouldn't have impulse-bought it to begin with. So: math traded away, replaced with Android version. Android version played once. The end.

Great game!  I haven't played a game that has lead to this many cheers and groans for a long long time.  

Some complain this game is too easy and while that may or may not be true I don't hear anyone saying that it isn't fun.  That's because it is!  I for one am glad that this co-op game doesn't beat us senseless like others of it's ilk.  Arkham Horror, Witch of Salem, Ghost Stories, and Defenders of the Realm.  These games can be brutal.  I appreciate that Elder Sign is more approachable.  Each individual challenge can be difficult and that is what leads to the fun.  The designers have made a game that feels like you accomplished something without crushing your spirit.  This game will hit the table often.

I'm enjoing Elder Sign more than I really should or thought I would. Elder Sign is essentially a horror themed yahtzee based on H.P. Lovecrafts Cthulhu mythos. For such a simple game it features a lot of pieces making it look more complex than it really is. The game do however benefit from adjusting the rules and making some changes to it. Elder Sign is far too easy in it original form. It's great fun and takes not too long to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While generally our favourite games are mid to heavy weight optimizing/efficiency euros, sometimes it's just great fun to chuck a bunch of dice. And Elder Sign delivers in spades.

Gameplay is pretty simple, generally you're just choosing a room, and trying to roll the pictured dice combo. Sometimes order matters, sometimes not, monsters can come out and make things tougher, spells and items make things easier, clues allow you to re-roll dice.

One play was enough to make me ditch Arkham Horror forever. I immediately sold my entire Arkham collection, keeping only the painted minis, as they work fantastic for ES. In ES, I get all the dice rolling and decision making of Arkham, only in 60-90 minutes instead of 5 or 6 hours.

edit: Forgot to talk about the difficulty. I keep reading over and over again how easy this game is, and I keep wondering what people are smoking. In 5 games, I've had 2 massive losses (7 dead investigators), and 3 barely eeked out victories where the final seal was achieved just before the Goo woke up. And a couple of those wins are with the rules as written, allowing one card to be used as a "monster dump" when no set monster spaces are showing. With that officially changed, those 2 wins would have been sure losses, making me 1 for 5.

Gioco piacevole, veloce ma non dimenticarsi di leggere ad alta voce il testo tematico. manuale di gioco scritto veramente male.

Me: easy game to play with parents sisters brothers, if U like horror it's ok.

Luca Iennaco say:

"Yahtzee with Lovercraftian theme" is a somewhat apt description.
Few interesting choices, no real interaction, randomness in spades (besides the dice rolling) and way too repetitive for how long it lasts.
A standard FFG box: beatiful bits without a decent ruleset to use them.

Too long for what it is and feels easy in a broken way. There's only one real type of decision you make in this game (picking which adventure to play) and unfortunately that decision is pretty much trivial. In addition to that, the mythos deck is so forgiving that the Ancient One's doom track basically never fills up. 

This combined with the ability to camp out at the shop and adventures being open info means you basically never have to risk anything and never feel under any kind of threat. Which is not great for a Lovecraftian game.

The game has really great mechanics and it plays quite interesting. The only big minus are the rules - although they are quite logical and rather easy to understand I still would like to see more precision and explanation on details. 

Maybe it's my lack of experience in playing more board games or something else but from time to time I was tempted to let myself and other players "loose on the rules" and I really don't like it. That means you can alter the rules and not get penalized fro that in any way.

One of my favorites. Good presentation, good cooperative mechanics, excellent background and good art makes this a perfect pick any evening or cold winter day. Depending on playstyle and luck, sometimes the investigators have difficulties to help each other and you will end up fighting and ultimately losing to whatever Old One decided he wants our world at that hour. But sometimes you get that perfect team, and you get the feeling no Old One can defeat you. I recall when I initially started to play this game I though the possibilities of investigators to help each other are rather minimal. I couldn't be more wrong. Now I can say using the investigators skills is an essential strategy for winning this game. Add to this all the extra investigators the expansions are adding and the possibilities are endless.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATED: I love this game... But it needs a cardboard version of the iPad expansion. It's just too easy...

Probably my favourite game. I would give it a 10, but I know it's not perfect and won't suit everyone.

It's effectively a push-your-luck dice game with a Lovecraft theme. You need to match certain symbols on adventure cards by rolling dice. But good tactics are needed. You need to decide which characters to commit to which adventure depending on their equipment and special skills. For example, spells allow characters to hold back a dice that's showing the right symbol and rollover the rest. Unique and common items allow characters to roll additional dice. Some characters find it easier to commit to adventures in Other Worlds or battle monsters.

It's way too easy. We've never lost a game. But this doesn't detract from the enjoyment. It's just fun and you don't need to think too hard. A nice social fill-in game to play if you're tired.

Elder Sign is not remotely similar to Arkham Horror or an RPG. It's similar to Roll through the Ages, but with less maths.

The worst thing going for this game is that itâs a cooperative game, and Iâm over cooperative games at this point.  I like dice, and I like Cthulhu-themed games, but putting a cooperative game over that kind of design just ruins it for me.  It seems insanely difficult (unless we played it incorrectly), which I guess is fine, but I at least want to get the feeling that itâs possible to beat the game at some point.  Based on that one play, though, it seems like you would have to have the perfect confluence of events play out through the cards and dice to even have a chance.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Best described as a fun, but slightly fiddly, low complexity Lovecraftian dice fest. My biggest grief with Elder Sign is the clock because I keep forgetting to turn the bloody thing. A part from that the overall design of the game is great. The rules are easy and the rulebook is ok (Revised Edition). Components are of the usual high quality we've come to expect from FFG.

RATING: 6
I had a quick demo game of this at Gen Con and was a bit under-whelmed. I think some rules were fudged to keep it moving, because after playing it on my own I have found it to have far more decision points than I remember seeing in that first game. It's also been very enjoyable as a solo game, as the rules are simple enough for one person to run two or three heroes at a time. 

The dice are used in a fun, Yahtzee styled manner and the push your luck aspect of taking on the more difficult missions add even more excitement. The only thing missing from the full Arkham Horror experience is the flavor text. There is a small bit on each adventure card and if you try hard enough, you can certainly piece together a narrative. Still, it's nowhere near the epic stories that play out in the parent game. Fantasy Flight dropped the ball here, because if they had just taken the time to explain what the adventurers were trying to accomplish in rolling each set of symbols, the game's narrative would have been ten times more engaging.

Elder sign won't replace Arkham Horror, but it's just about perfect when the group only has an hour or so to work with. I just hope they expand it to include more of our favorite Arkham investigators and GOO's.

UPDATE: (5/13/12)

I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree with most of the game's critics and knock down my rating a notch. Elder Sign is too easy. I'm not completely bored with it, but I do think I'm winning way too much. The spells (which are usually a big part of any Mythos based game) are dull and repetitive, not to mention they also make beating encounters way too common. Maybe I just have iOS envy, because from what I hear, the Omens version is excellent in every way. Hopefully Fantasy Flight will expand and patch the cardboard game as well. If not, I'm probably just about done with it.

UPDATE: (01/06/13)

I finally got to play the electronic version on my android phone and it has indeed been improved. The missions and monsters are more challenging and the overall difficulty level of the game has been ratcheted up. How do we convince Fantasy Flight to back load these improvements into the cardboard?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent game either solo or cooperative with multiple friends.  The challenge level is not as bad as say Space Hulk: Death Angel, but still hard nonetheless.  An excellent change of pace for Cthulu Mythos fans who want a very small scale game experience without the time (and space) needed for larger games like Arkham Horror, Mansions of Madness, or Eldritch Horror.

I figured I had to get at least one Cthulhu/paranormal game in my collection and this one has the theme, dice chucking and collaborative play. I enjoy the story telling and the fist pumping, or moral demolishing moments that come with the rolling of dice.  

I actually added stickers to the back of the museum cards for both the base game and Unseen Forces so that it can be played like a medium weight Streets of Arkham and this bumps my rating up to an 8.

Really doesn't convey the same tension of "building up resources to deter/battle the Elder God" as Arkham Horror. Maybe it's too easy, or maybe equipment is too temporary.

RATING: 5
This is a fun game for the first few plays, but in the end, it's just too dang easy.  We play with the supposedly super-extra-hard variant where you have to fight the Great Old One after sealing it away, and we have still won every single time.  Without the challenge, the game ends up feeling over long and repetitive.

---

Meta-commentary rant added later:

The core mechanics of this game are borrowed from Knizia.  But instead of Knizia's mathematical insight and fine-tuning we have FFG's gobs of cards and bits.

I think it's depressing that the market (at least according to BGG) has clearly established that more and prettier stuff is more important than good design.  Elder Sign isn't a terrible game, but it seems ridiculous to me that this game has so many more owners and a higher rating than similar but smarter games like Ra: The Dice Game and Risk Express.

Knizia may be dry at times but he knows how to make a dice game challenging and interesting.

the only drawback this has is that it is a bit too easy.  you can win pretty much every time you play.... but you know what?  who cares!

Play this... you will love it!

Elder Sign started off promising a sort of "Arkham Horror Lite". Sadly, in trimming down the game, the designers have removed most of the decision-making and excitement from it. Turns are basically reduced to: "pick a mission, try to roll matching dice". There is some limited strategy to deciding what order to attempt the missions but the choice is almost always obvious. The "co-op" element is also completely uninteresting and amounts to nothing more than "keeping" another die result. Useful but uninspiring.

I made sure to play with all updates and errata which did keep the game from being a complete push-over, yet out of 6 plays I still never lost a single game and only ever failed a handful of missions. The game is entirely too easy...the death-knell of a solo/co-op game. The lack of challenge might be forgiven if the gameplay were fun or rewarding. Unfortunately, Elder Sign quickly devolves into a bland chain of dice rolls with few stakes and no tension.

The production values are gorgeous but the visuals and Lovecraftian theme don't save it from boredom and mediocrity. Though Arkham Horror suffers from its severely demanding length-of-play, it is a far more exciting and meaningful experience. Elder Sign is certainly a far shorter affair and yet the loss of 60 minutes to Elder Sign feels far more regrettable than losing 4 hours to Arkham. Not recommended.

A relaxing coop dice chucker for a variable player count.
I like the light dice chuking and the cooperative aspect. But somehow this game seems to long for what it is. It should be a 30-45 minute filler, not a 90 minute game.
At this point I would prefer some heavier games for this playtime. Also don't like the Cthulu theme.
I hope VivaJava Dice offers what I'm looking for.

RATING: N/A
A more refined and streamlined generation of the Cthuhulian dice and card driven narrative adventures. I like how the clock thematically counts down the mythos events. Location tests and encounters are completed with special dice using a focus mechanic and modified by spending item cards.  This can be drawn out which is either enjoyable and adds a dramatic tension or will seem a tedious reminder why you dislike roll to resolve games. Depends on my mood but I tend toward the latter.  I do appreciate that booby prizes are given for crud luck rolling to aid future attempts.

We're light/light-medium gamers, so this colour-drenched horror-fest really hits the spot. The more we play, the more we seem to enjoy. Random as hell, and fun as hell... in hell.

Once realised that spells, re-roll, focus and assist are your four best friends it does become somewhat solved, but the random nature of the dice keeps on bringing the mayhem along with the random draw of locations with risk/reward to calc each turn.

Doesn't offer the extra dice control of Nations Dice, RTTA or Ciub, but it does attract non-gamers in a way many boutique games couldn't ever hope to.

Elder Sign vanilla is an enjoyable experience. For those of us without a lot of time, it is a wonderful alternative to Eldritch Horror or Arkham Horror. However, it is at it's most basic, a yahtzee re-skin. The quality of the components and the fun lore/flavor text do up the ante and make this game stand out.

I love scary games and dice- so this is pretty much the perfect game for me.

The only issue I take with the game is that I cannot seem to lose, and it always ends sooner than I would like.

The randomness of dice can make the game impossible to win, but cards and clue tokens can help overcome the randomness with rerolls and ability to change to a specific result or save a die for later. I think the mechanics are sufficient to remove enough randomness that it isn't unfun, remains challenging, and requires significantly poor luck to be rendered impossible. 

Theme is present and strong, doesn't feel arbitrary. 

Would play again.

RATING: 8
A close cousin to Risk Express, but such a weird design: A solo experience broken into multiple player characters just so everyone has something to do.  This is only a coop game in the sense that four people in the same room are cooperating to fill their shared space with carbon dioxide as they exhale.

Pray that the game doesn't go long.  If it doesn't, though, it's OK dicey fun.

[i]Update:[/i]

Having played a second time, I'll admit my error.  Elder Sign is a good game that works just fine as a light co-op.

I'll even suggest that Elder Sign is a clear improvement over Risk Express, which has two common endgame issues: (1) players can spend their final turns doing nothing but stealing cards from each other, and (2) players can be unable to end the game because the last remaining card is too difficult to obtain.  

Elder Sign avoids both problems, which is a huge improvement.  Additionally, ES has its own thematic intricacies - monsters, spells, weapons, etc. - that flat-out make it a better game.

Both games suffer when the player number goes up, though.

Great theme, lots of bits and cards and more bits and more cards.  Tons of characters.  Endless variety.  And fun dice-chucking!

Down side - the dice can just be punishing, and the game usually has a kind of inertia that means once you start losing, you're probably going to continue.  We mitigate this with a "share resources" rule that's a bit more liberal than the one in the rulebook -- this way, if one person's getting stomped by locations, the others can toss some help their way.

First off, I love Co-Op and Dice Rolling Games, and this game has both... so right there is an immediate plus for this game. Not a huge fan of the Cuthulu / Lovecraft genre, but I don't dislike it either it's just ok for me. That being said this game's theme comes across very well and it's a perfect ratio between luck and strategy, which is hard to do with such a heavy dice mechanic. One negative is that it the game tends to be a little on the easy side, my friends and I and have found variants and made some house rules to make the game a little more difficult and made a good into a great game. Only other negative I would say is the price. While I love this game... it's not a $40 game. $25-$30 is probably about right for this one, but if you are a big fan of the Lovecraft theme I could see paying more as like I said above, the theme comes across very well.

I might not have mentioned it before, since it's not as big a thing for me as it assuredly is for many others, but I do enjoy my Lovecraft. With cooperation and dice (plus dice manipulation) playing an important, yet not crucial role, this sounds like a great game to pick up. Plus there's tons of expansions, so if it takes, it can stay fresh for a long time.

An odd game; a dice-based lighter relative of Arkham Horror. It's much shorter and simpler but with the same high-quality components (which is great) but it's extremely easy to win unless you have terrible luck (which means house rules are necessary).

The worst thing about it is the written rules (NB: the revised rules are much better). Unbelievably unclear and full of holes, they're only partly redeemed by the official errata/FAQ. There's simply no excuse for this sort of thing.

So, I generally end up with a huge headache when I play Arkham Horror. It's not like I play it all that often, because it takes a humongous amount of space on the table, and a load of time to place of the little bits and if you're unlucky you just end up in some corner waiting for all the other players to do their thing. 

But Elder Sign for me is my saviour. It's got the same theme (yes, I'm one of those) but it's much more slender as a game. I like the satisfaction of getting trophies as I defeat monsters and acquire locations and the suspense while wondering if we can get enough Elder Signs to defeat the monsters. It's also a cooperative game, which is something that I'm more comfortable with. 

I'd say it's got the right amount of chance and choices. Because there are different roles that you can take we'll end up deciding which locations to take depending on our abilities, even though some times the dice really have a weird sense of humour.

If I'm not in the mood for something that takes more time to set up and lasts more, this is more or less my default choice. I might also sneak it in after a longer game, if I'm not ready for bed.

Very much enjoy this game even though it is quite simple overall (not necessarily true after the expansion comes out!).

I end up playing it often because it runs quickly and let's my mind take a rest after heavier games.  Always have a good time playing it.

Good dice game that plays perfect in solitaire mode, but with more players low a little bit the experience. Really fun for a 30-45 min play but if the play runs more it becomes a little boring. Too much rely on the dice luck. But as a little brother of the Arkham series works for me.

Nice cooperative dice-chucking game that has a lot of theme, even though it is not very thematic. A great gateway with the opportunity for very much strategy but also with a lot of luck on every turn.
If you have played it a lot of times though, it gets a little too easy. But that can be helped by the several expansions.

Really enjoyed this as an Android app - bought the board game and enjoyed it even more.

After a while it began to lose its appeal. I don't think we ever lost the board game version, the app is more challenging.

It is more lightweight than Arkham Horror, but has overall the same mechanics. I like this fact about the game, also that it plays not so long. But I have never lost. I have no idea if it is possible to loose this game. Nonetheless the tension during the game is always high.

I love the Android application, and that is why I went and got a copy of the physical game.

I have a game group that loves dice games, and my family and some great friends love coops, and my oldest daughter and I love horror movies, so this game is a great fit for us.

I enjoy the Yahtzee-like nature of rolling dice, saving some results, applying others to adventure tasks, balancing rewards vs risks, and the theme is fantastic! I've been intrigued by the Chuthulhu mythos, but not in the RPG or any of the other board games, but this looks just right for my tastes. The various player roles also have such fun and different powers, that replay value is very high.

I've payed this game twice now with a fairly large group of people (7 players the first time and 6 players the second time) and both games were a huge amount of fun!  Very few co-op games that I've played are both tense and gets the entire table into every person's rolls.  In my opinion this game is much better than Arkham Horror in that it is set in the same universe with the same themes, but ends up being less involved and much more entertaining for the entire table with the same level of intensity.  Playing this game you can get the feel of the Cthulu mythos and still get to play something else that night ;)

This is a good game and was actually the first I ever purchased as a hobby board gamer. I do enjoy it, but it can be sometimes overly difficult. Randomness is the main enemy here, but that's to be expected, given that it's a game nearly entirely driven by dice. I enjoy the theme, and have enjoyed the expansions, but found that it's just very difficult to get it to the table these days. Not many in my gaming group have a strong desire for such randomness. As far as dice games, my choice would probably go to Alien Frontiers, as there are many ways to mitigate your random results, and you're never entirely without options. There's always something to do.

Never have heard of this game until last Friday. That was the day, this game showed up in our house in a miraculous way. For one or the other strange reason, this game immediately attracted me. Even before the foil of the box was removed, I started reading about this game. From that moment on, I wanted to play this game badly. I almost felt sorry that we âhadâ to go to the board-games-club in Geel yesterday. Another day that we wouldnât be able to get this game on the table. But we knew that the day that would happen would soon be very close. First thing I did this morning, after punching all the cardboard parts, was to look if somebody did a nice job for us, by translating the game-rules into Dutch.  Well, nobody did, so I started to read the English rules a couple of times. As English isnât my mother-language, there were some difficulties for me in the rules, but after looking some things up, in a FAQ-sheet Iâve found at the geek, everything was pretty clear to me, and I was able to explain everything to M. The game mechanics arenât too hard to understand, so we could start pretty fast with playing. What seemed as a pretty easy task to fulfill, turned out to be a very hard job to do. Cooperation is needed in this game. By the time we discovered how we could do that the best way, M. became insane (well, her character did by losing all of itâs sanity tokens), and a new role showed up. We knew for sure, that we wouldnât be able to collect all the needed Elder Signs. But we were lucky. The dice rolled like they should roll, the cards showed up, helped us out very well, and we barely defeated the monster.

All, I can say about this game is, exactly what Iâve expected of it, WOW! This is a whole kind of new game for us. Never played Arkham Horror before (a playing time of 4 hours is not something we like a lot), and what we have heard of the time needed to set up this game, the chance we would play it someday isnât too big at all. First game for us of Elder Sign, took us almost two hours, but we werenât bored for a single minute. On the contrary, within a curse and a sigh the game was at its end. This is one, which has the special spark, weâre always looking for in a game. Somebody on this world did a great (I should say: FANTASTIC) job, by picking this one out.

I like Arkham Horror A LOT, but the setup time is massive, the board(s) hog(s) space and players must commit hours to play through one session.  This isn't at all a problem, because the game play makes up for these inconveniences and sometimes a long, complex game fits the bill.

Elder Sign will definitely hit my table much more often though!  Not only is the setup quick and easy, a single session is short and allows more sessions to be played in one sitting.  I very much like this aspect as the gameplay feels rewarding and each session is fulfilling.

I would go as far as saying that Elder Sign is a more streamlined variant of Arkham Horror.  Although Elder Sign is much more compact in comparison to AH, I feel that everything has more purpose, items are more useful, combat is straight-forward, and best of all, the Lovecraftian theme was not reduced. 

The artwork is very beautiful and highly thematic and almost always accompanied by flavor text which draws the players deeper into game play.  I find this aspect fun, exciting and very rewarding.  Elder Sign's gaming experience is definitely memorable!

The game components are top-notch as to be expected from Fantasy Flight Games.  Sure there do exist some minor FAQ and typos, but I am willing to overlook this since the game finds its way to the table often.

Ominous Yahtzee!  while the rulebook SUCKS and the components are very *mhe*, ES still makes for a good, fun, co-operative experience.  It's definitely a push-your-luck game, but with enough decision making that you'll feel like you are still playing a game, instead of being played *Pathfinder ACG!* cough!

Beautiful production values, as expected. I wanted to love this game. But aside from the pretty pictures and a line (maybe two, if you're lucky) of fluff text on a few of the cards, there's no atmosphere here at all. It's nothing more than an exercise in rolling (and rolling and rolling) dice  nicely clad in Arkham Horror trappings but totally failing to exude that AH atmosphere. I can safely say that this is the most unenjoyable game I've ever had the displeasure of playing - I repacked it and returned it after one play. Unless you like rolling dice over and over (and are very lucky) and figuring out statistical models so you can best plan how to approach the layout, stay far far away from this piece of junk. (BTW, anybody who says this game is too easy is not playing it right - it is extremely challenging - for example, I computed the odds of completing one of the 1-trophy adventures at somewhere around 2 in 100, even properly equipped. If you're playing it right, it's a hard game to beat. What ruins it is not the challenge level, but that it's really just about stacking the odds to beat an abstract challenge, passing or failing, going back to the entrance to re-equip, rinse and repeat as necessary. There's no joy to be had here. You find yourself more concerned with beating the odds than the Great Old One...)

A nice co-op dice game based on the Cthulhu mythos. It is basically a yahtzee based game where you are rolling dice in order to complete missions. It provides a good gaming experience but it might seem quite easy for most players. Haven't tried the expansion though, maybe it makes it more competitive.

I never thought I'd say this but... Elder Sign's too easy.  It's too easy to manage the monsters onto a mission that you're going to punt, and occasionally do some suicide runs on it.  None of the hopelessness that Arkham Horror had.

A cool, heavy-for-a-dice-game affair that is enjoyable and breaks the co-op mold a bit. The rules can be fiddly, but I guess being related to Arkham Horror will do that to a game. If you like intricate dice games, co-op games, or the Cthulhu mythos, you'll dig this. Be aware, however, the theme here is paper-thin compared to Arkham Horror.

Another good difficulty boost is to have every roll you make advance the clock one hour, *instead* of advancing it 3 every time. Advance 3 when at the shop.

People don't seem enthused to play this one. Not enough attachment to the characters or game narrative.

---------

Nice fun semi-light dice rolling game. But out of the box the game is too easy (unless your initial quests are all really hard). Luckily there are many different simple tweaks you can make to make it a more interesting challenge. One that sounds promising is moving the clock 5 hours each times instead of 3.

Still undecided on the rating.

There's a fair amount of luck involved, since there's a lot of dice rolling (although it is part of the mechanics and you have options if you want to be almost guaranteed success).

Despite the fact that there's less immersion than in the bigger games it's trying to emulate (Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness), we still ended up having a lot of fun and there were quite a few very tense moments.

Will wait to play more to give a definite rating.

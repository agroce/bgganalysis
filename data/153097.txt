Heroes Wanted - a game I had backed on Kickstarter. This one has stellar production values - just solid quality top to bottom. My only take back from the graphic design is the 'types' on the hand of cards (DEF ATK, MOV, etc). These are not really used at all during typical play (I believe they are referenced by some powers in the game?). I found this confusing in general. But that aside, the game play was very easy and even simplistic. There's only move and fight - it gives the game a rinse-and-repeat feel in general - albeit both are continually modified by card play and unique powers (and there are zillions of powers in the game).

The number of scenarios is very nice - two double-sided game boards gives alot of variety here and they are wonderfully silly. You add headlines to the board as well - about 5 or so each game - that are short term scores during play. But more than all that, the main feature is the two-card set up of heroes and villains. It's difficult to say exactly how many combinations are possible - but far more than you'd ever see in hundreds of plays. This is by far and away the smartest and funniest aspect of the game.

In any event, not a bad game at all, excellent funny set ups and I'm happy to have backed it on KS.

RATING: 7.8
I actually have enjoyed my first few plays more than the rating would suggest. It's just that most of the fun in this game is kind of front loaded... Which superheroes will be in the game, which villain? The combinations are entertaining, and the different scenarios are fun. It's just that once it gets going, there isn't as much superhero feeling left. You run around and do damage to minions, over and over again, until the game ends. It's possible to build some pretty impressive combos, but... I can't really explain it... It just feels like a brawl between slightly differentiated characters. Not sure if it will hold up, despite what looks like a lot of variety when you open the box.

Also, despite the somewhat simple game in some ways, there is some complexity in the hand management which makes it a little trickier than I expected to pick up for casual players.

Anyway, Great setting, great components, fun game, but will it last?

RATING: N/A
The game was a ton of fun, with laughing and joking and backstories being passed around.  And then we started playing and it wasn't much fun.

Mechanically, movement is really tough to get and tougher to use (you will get punched and not be able to punch back since you used your only action to move), this results in fairly stale play, since everyone stakes out an area and just camps.

Game-wise, it feels like it wants to be a serious VP / set collection game, except that it isn't balanced, there isn't really much strategy, and there aren't too many meaningful decisions.  It's also way too long for what it is.

Would not need to own, and would need to be convinced to play again.

RATING: 5
1st play: The best part of this game is the setup, as the random hero/villain combinations are comical and well done.  The quirks sound funny, and for the first 3 or 4 instances, they are.  Unfortunately the game overstays it's welcome and becomes a slog of 2 actions, block, rest over and over again.  I'd love to see the hero creation mechanic here in a better game though.

Picked it up as part of the original Kickstarter.

I really wanted to like this game, but I think it really depends on the group you are playing with.  The game has a more cerebral aspect than you would at first think.  It gives an impression of being light and funny than sneaks up on you as a strategy game.

RATING: 7.1
I feel like this game really has two sides to it, the first of which is far more amusing, where you're putting together a hero out of all these silly combination cards and then getting a unique power set. Then it becomes a more drab and mechanical experience as you clear out the maps, and it loses some of that charm. That said, having the different maps for scenarios is a nice touch, and at least it's a unique approach to the superhero genre that feels nothing like Legendary, DC Deckbuilder, or Sentinels.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Not a game for me. The current (as of this writing) average ranking of 8.19 is total kickstarter hype. Where to start...

1) The quirks might be the worst aspect of the game.  They should never be played with.
2) There is only 1 additional card you can add to your hand, so basically you will rinse and repeat for 90 min.  Boring.
3) Not the designer for me.  I hated Infamy (maybe the worst game I played last year?) and this one is right at the same level.  
4) The artwork for the game is cool.  I also thought the hero building aspect was neat, but not even close to enough to make the game interesting.  Not something I am looking forward to playing again.

One of the most genuinely funny games I've played.  The hero/villain combinations, catchphrases, art style, quirks, and scenarios all strike the same goofy funny tone and it all fits and works quite nicely.  What's interesting is that it's all on top of tactical euro-ish hand management game.  The theme of beating up bad guys (and each other) does come through, somewhat, in the gameplay.  The game plays quickly and it's not mathy and doesn't require a lot of info to be tracked.  I was worried about these issues probably because they are some aspects I didn't like in Sentinels.  It does require a couple plays to get the strategy and it's definitely a game you'll improve at with repeat plays.  With all that said, I think the the hilarious aspects in this game don't quite match with the game itself and I wonder if they wouldn't be best applied to something a little lighter or more AT and less euro.

:d6-1:
This is not Batman (and having looked on it these "superheroes" feel kind of silly) but the game looks like a lot of fun. It offers solitaire gaming out of the box too. (Yes - I am aware of the aspect of scores and beating them). Also this game comes with a lot of memories and a fun story so I would like to try it.

I offered up a copy of this on GamesforGeekGold here on BGG (to get geekgold to buy microbadges) and it was won by a Swiss guy. I couldn´t buy it from a store there (or get it shipped there) so I ordered a copy here and then sent it to Switzerland (This was during spring 2016). A month later we realise it has gotten lost on the way and given I´ve just ordered another copy for myself we decided he would get that one instead. I swore to him that he would get his copy if I so had to come deliver it myself.
 
However - when it arrived here in early July he was on vacation so we decided to take care of it when he was back. Then I went to Nijmegen, met a Swiss guy and fell in love... He came here and we decided I would go to him in Switzerland early september. Three days before I leave for Switzerland the winner sends me a message that he was back (I had forgotten all about it having had the game stored in a cupboard that I seldom use). I check it up and it turns out he lives an hours ride from my partner - in a town that we were going to travel too during my visit in Switzerland...

I couldn´t get hold of the winner so I brought the game with me. Just before we left to go back home we managed to get hold of his wife (he was out for the evening) and I delivered the game to her.

So just looking at this game will bring out nice memories of my first trip to Switzerland, my partner there and this story. Not the best of reasons for playing a game but still...

It's not a bad game and is mostly fun. I really like the variable powers to help keep the game fresh.

I don't like that's it's not co-op and being attacked by other players. I understand the theme is to become the most famous, but I just have a hard time getting into that mindset if I'm playing a superhero. 

The quirks are great in the beginning but I felt they would start to wear out their welcome towards the end of the game.

Again, at a 6 it's not a bad game, it's just I won't always be in the mood to play it.

This game is just boring.  The part where you pick your character and laugh at it is fun, but after that it's just boring.

The superhero theme is pasted on worse than a Reiner Knizia game. Nothing about the game play feels like superheroes.

I hate that the game feels like a co-op because the majority of damage comes from the board,but the game rewards you for screwing over players.

Worst superhero game ever.  I'd rather play the old X-Men games.

I'm pretty sure that my dislike of this game had nothing to do with me being up for 24 hours by the time we played it.  The character "quirks" were nothing more than a way of forcing players to do something stupid in the lame attempt at humor.  I lost interest part of the way through the game.

The characters are fun to make. (or get if you just totally randomize it with dealing out only one A and B card)

The Quirks are fun. (provided you like getting into character)

Only being able to play one card, and using cards to block damage does give the game some strategic element.

I found it fun to play, best with at least 3 players or more.

Starts as an 8, at least... could go higher if I decide serious strategic gameplay runs all the way through. I suspect it does. Some rules niggles, though. Also, not sure whether Quirks will stand the test of time or just be a "first few games" gimmick.

RATING: 9
This game surprised me, in a good way.  I thought it was going to be a light, witty, super hero game.  It is a super hero game, and it is witty, but it is not a light game.  It is considerably more cerebral that it appeared to be based on what I had seen.  Since I like my games on the deeper side, this was a plus.  Although I could see some people being disappointed in this game as I think that it presents itself to be something that it isn't.

In the abstract, I have to say, this game reminds me of Mage Knight.  It is about managing your hand of cards to do what you need to get done in an efficient manner, while being able to move around the board to where you need to be in order to do these things.

The only think I don't really care for are the quirks, but they aren't an integral part of the game so they can easily be left completely out without affecting anything. 

At first, before playing, I thought it would be a little light on replayability by having only 4 scenarios in the box, but after actually playing, 4 scenarios, combined with all the combinations of heroes and villians is more replayability than I will ever exhaust.

Played at BGG.con 2014, and the only game that I felt was a complete waste of our time. Somehow the rulebook succeeds only in obfuscating the fact that the game is actually a basic move-and-attack type of thing. We seriously spent an hour and half trying to figure out how the game worked, then felt like idiots once we realized how simplistic it was.

The gimmick of building your own heroes had me excited, but you do that in the first five minutes and then the rest of the hero cards all go into the box for the rest of the game. Whoops. 

All that, and the art and components are pretty boring when you come down it. It seems that you really do need the big publishing houses to make something that actually looks like a superhero game.

Disclaimer: Participated in kickstarter

Finally got this to the table and played the first scenario.  I think the reason I'm not rating this any higher at the moment is because the first scenario is pretty weak and the others seem more interesting.  However, until I play them, the rating will stay as it is, halfway between OK and Good.

The game is extremely fascinating thematically - the idea that every player is a superhero-hopeful attempting to join Zeta City's equivalent of the Justice League is excellent, coupled with the fact that all player characters are generated by a combo of two cards.  This makes for initially-hilarious superheroes running around trying to get things done (in our game, Mighty Bullet won the day).  However, the joke wears thin after the first turn and you're off to try and KO some minions.  I mention the theme and humor first because unfortunately (thus far), this is the strength and appeal of the game.

Mechanically, the game is quite simple and has some great ideas - completing objectives known as headlines allows you to upgrade your hero over time and unlock a powerful ability or take advantage of some immediate bonuses.  Ultimately, the game is fundamentally about hand management, which is how you move about the board and attack other heroes, underlings, or the villain himself (also a random draw of two cards).  Key strategies for the game boils down to positioning yourself in the right spot for the upcoming turns and playing cards in the right order to take advantage of their abilities/bonuses.

Where the game seemed weak on the initial play is that the player turns aren't all that exciting.  Sure, you're working towards completing objectives and gathering much-needed glory points in order to win, but it's all so... mechanical.  Moreover, because of that, it seems over too fast as you only get to play one card on your turn and then the villains have their go.  Because of back-and-forth between player and villain turns, you'll find that you're racing down the turn track much faster than you'd like, and the game is over in no time.  While I was playing a teaching game, if I remove that, I'd say the first scenario (others appear more complex) can be belted out in 30-45 minutes.

Ultimately, the amount of fun you're going to have with this game comes down to who you're playing it with.  If most of your group is comprised of introverts and people who love multiplayer solitaire, this is not the game for you.  Part of the fun comes from "role-playing" your hero and the optional quirk cards (potentially-embarrassing things that players have to do if they want to score points, like make sound effects when they play cards or hand out high fives to the table when a minion is knocked out), so it's not a game for the socially awkward.

Finally, it was extremely clear that a key part of what will make or break a particular play is the cards that make up the heroes and the villain.  While the villain is what you draw, I would suggest that for heroes, people should choose the more interesting combos as opposed to the 'winningest' ones - this game isn't really about winning; it's about having fun with friends.  To that end, the game sets out what it wants to do.

It's the perfect beer 'n' pretzels game, but don't expect much more from it.

That being said, the sheer number of potential combinations of cards that can be created is ridiculous and helps with replayability - however, I'm hoping that future expansions will make more of them, like perhaps some sort of cosmic blender which forces players to swap half of their hero out for a new one (thematically speaking, this is kind of like those superheroes that reboot into new characters in the comics).

Lots of fun. Especially with lots of people. Quirks add some rather interesting (& sometimes creepy or downright annoying) elements to the game. Play is relatively simple but because your action cards are being depleted with each attack/defend phase, it requires some forward thinking to plan out your next few moves.

Backed the Kickstarter and I"m so glad I did after the hype this got after Gen Con. 

Rated a 7.5 after half a 5 player game, a full solo game, and reading through all the hero cards. Can't wait to get a full game in where I'm sure this grade will go up. Wrinkles the extremely strategic part of my brain. You really have to plan several moves ahead with how you decide you utilize your cards, all wrapped up a package that feels like Mystery Men meets The Tick. Awesome.

It can feel repetitive, and serious brain-burning gamers should look elsewhere, but the game has so much charm my casual group doesn't care. We are fans of the quirks (which many people have voiced annoyance with)--we're a social bunch and like to laugh. I bought Lego figures of superheroes to replace the player markers. More theme, yes!

Mechanics can feel a little clunky at times, but that could be because we haven't gotten used to it. Will find out with more plays.

I wasn't won over by the silly theme and the combining of hero parts. Some powers are clearer unbalanced versus others. The gameplay is fine, but kind of too fiddly and complex for what should be a beer and pretzels fun game. And I couldn't quite get into the whole "say a dumb thing to do something" idea, especially when mine came up about 6 times more often than anyone else.

RATING: 2
Too long, too dull, and just didn't feel like a heroes game.  I played both scenarios once.  

The game has some very silly rules (thankfully optional).  The first scenario has a silly premise.  I'm totally fine with that, but the game needs to be fun.  Instead, it just mirthlessly dragged.  

The card play is clever, but too clever for its own good.  Instead of playing feats of daring-do, I felt like I was... staring at cards... trying to figure out... which combo... might... yeah, I know it's my turn!...  dang, now which card was I going to play before this other one?

The two-card build-a-hero character creation is excellent.  I was genuinely excited to hit the streets with my chimera of justice, but there was simply no action to be had.

In the second scenario, you free a city inhabited, apparently, by very threatening statues.  Other than the main villain, the the bad guys don't DO anything.

Note, abstraction does not bother me.  I *LOVE* Heroes Incorporated, with its generic "Crimes A through F" meandering around the city.  That game is, in several ways, too simple; but with that simplicity is a genuinely fun game.  I also love teasing out very complex thematic games, say Insecta or most anything else by Phil Eklund, and enjoy them immensely.

This one: far too much time with my head buried in my cards and far too little POW!

RATING: 8.9
I have spent some time with the game now and I love it. When people ask me what it plays like I have a hard time answering because I have not played anything else like it. Some say the hand management aspect resembles Mage Knight, which I haven't played. I have found that as a somewhat experienced player I thrash newbies every time, which reminds me of some of the Euros I play like Agricola. I may plan a half dozen moves ahead, which is something that you can only do with experience.  Ultimately it does come down to planning and figuring out what combos work. Movement is not nearly as restricted as some would have you believe once you figure out how to utilize all of the options available (which change every game based on your hero).

Hero abilities and related cards make a big enough difference to matter and do add a dynamic element to the game. This is important since both players start with the same base cards each time. The ability to solo play is a bonus. This is a game that I will break out every now and then and try to beat my high score. It is a different experience because you don't have to consider the actions of the other hero(es). There is enough variety in the base game to keep it fresh for me indefinitely. I also have the expansions so I feel this is one of the best values for the money in my collection. The only thing that kept me from rating it higher is the barrier to entry. Now that I am an experienced player I have to play with other experienced players or else thrash my opponent which is just not that much fun. I will probably have to loan the game to my primary gaming partner and let him solo it a bit to try and hammer out a competitive strategy. If you do get the game it would be a good idea to start playing it with a group from scratch and try to keep playing with the same people so that your understanding of the game progresses together.  

Update: This is a game that has grown on us. Played it this week and agreed to play again next week, which is very rare. We almost never play the same game back to back weeks. As we continue to explore hero and villain combinations, as well as the 2 expansions that I have yet to play, the replay value seems endless. Absolutely love this game.

RATING: 5
The concept is a great deal of fun, whereas the actual gameplay can't really deliver on that promise. Sure, som fun is to be had, and the "unlocking of powers" mechanism is really neat - but the game seems too static and your # of choices seems too limited, given the fact that you always select from a very small hand of cards.

Kickstarting this. The Crits Happen preview sold me on theme and gameplay. 

This game reminds me of the movie MYSTERY MEN or The Mighty Heroes cartoon, with a little bit of KICK-ASS thrown in.

My thoughts based on previews: in the early going, for me it is already trending towards "best superhero themed boardgame ever." 

This one is far cheaper and employs better mechanics/game system than Capes and Cowls. It use the variable power combo card mechanic from Strange Synergy (Steve Jackson Games hero battle game) but with less chaos and more depth in tactics and strategy. 

It incorporates RPG elements that lend to a stronger theme during gameplay than Legendary or the DC deckbuilder. And it gets away from the CCG or LCG model of endless card-based expanding superhero games like those mentioned above and Sentinels of the Multiverse, doing so with far less expense and cards.

The optional Quirks introduce mild, accessible party game or RPG elements for those that don't like such elements (akin to how Cards Against Humanity markets its game). And the replayability with customizable villain and hero combo cards, headlines, and four different scenarios, is off the charts. With their $10 dollar "Extra, Extra" card pack add-on, even better.

Above all I like that even though it is a hybrid of mechanics and components and styles of play, it is still recognizable as a board game and one with high replay value to boot, which other superhero games have had a difficult time accomplishing with their designs. 

I am very impressed with their Kickstarter campaign and their game. It's one of my most anticipated games of the year.

RATING: 8
My rating of this game is based on one condition: leaving out the "quirks" (required behaviors when certain events occur) for each superhero. The "forced silliness" mechanic inside a non-party game is one of my biggest pet peeves in gaming. It would ruin Heroes Wanted for me, but luckily this is an optional rule - so I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist.

That's because the rest of this game is gold. The humor and replayability is great - especially the combination of heroes and villains - the map-based tactics are simple and straightforward, and the card play and upgrading of powers are engaging. It almost plays a bit like a Euro at times with it providing plenty of various scoring opportunities, but it includes more than enough direct interaction to qualify it as a thematic game as well.

But seriously, don't play with the "quirks" - other than that, this is a stellar game.

Definitely requires the right group. The highlight of the game is creating your unique character, and then playing off your quirk for the rest of the game. Honestly, if you're not willing to play with the quirks, you're missing half the fun of the game. The card play is certainly interesting, managing your individual moves and powers in such a fashion to never leave yourself in a tight spot. But it's the integration of the theme and abundant goofiness that makes this game entertaining.

Clever humour, interesting hero creation. Gameplay a little "meh". Promising idea (balancing card play vs. resting) feels too calculating for a superhero smash-em-up.

RATING: 7
09-16-2014 - Almost disappointed, but not quite yet.  There isn't much variety in the game.  Well, ok, there are a billion different possible super heroes and villains, but the actions a Vigilante takes for instance will always, ALWAYS, be the same in every blasted game.  Well, except for their one super power which will be different, but that's one action (one card essentially) out of a grand total of, what, 6 cards is it?  So you get the same 5 or so actions as everyone else, a single card unique to your faction, plus a single unique special power linked to your hero.  I regard that as falling on the southern side of "samey".

That said, the game is cute and fun.  The quirks are a hoot and there are 4 different boards (scenarios) to help keep it interesting.  But will it be enough?

I've heard they're coming out soon with a big box expansion to add more mechanics (hopefully a little more depth?).  Maybe that'll shoot the game to the 8+ I hoped and expected it would be.  For now though, I'll give it a 7 and I'm afraid I'm being a little too generous with that.

Heroes Wanted is a tactical board game for 1-5 superhero hopefuls, attempting to fulfill their dreams of becoming a member of Zeta City’s exclusive crime fighting super team: The Champions of Zeta City. Each time you play, you will create a unique superhero comprised of two hero cards. You will then choose a scenario and face a different villain (or villains), but the objective remains the same: gain as much fame as possible by KO’ing minions, completing headlines, and thwarting the villain. At the end of each game, the superhero with the most fame is the winner and joins the prestigious ranks of The Champions of Zeta City.

This is a fantastic game. Random combinations of hero powers and villain powers makes each game different even when playing the same scenario. Quirks are fun in theory, but they have you doing the same thing over and over for the whole game, so you can just leave them out.

Heroes Wanted is mostly a "race" type of game, where everyone is trying to accomplish various goals first. General PvP jerk moves are discouraged because it sets you both back and usually for no gain, but you're always watching out for that rare "opportunity" to KO a careless fellow player to score a few extra points.

There's a little bit of clever card play in this, but I feel like it would be more exciting if you had more variety to the decks.  Also, it would have gone over much better as a coop.

There is talk here of games that keep telling you no when you want to do something but the game doesn't allow you to do it. I repeatedly left like I wanted to do something, but the game simply didn't allow me to do it or even forced me to not do it. The idea is there, but this fails in being a well rounded execution of said idea. This feels like a tactical miniatures game that went goofy and cute and I have no real interest in it.

Note, we didn't play with the quirks because even the guy teaching it found those too goofy to include.

This is essentially a tactical miniatures game (except with wooden tokens instead of miniatures) in which players compete to do the most damage to a villain and his minions, as well as complete several randomized mini-objectives the fastest.  Players have special powers based on their choice of the "top half" and "bottom half" cards of their superhero; the resultant combination of card names is actually quite humorous.  Players are also given a "quirk", which makes the player perform some sort of acting/improv task or lose points--this didn't really feel like it had a place in a strategy game.  Players take actions based on card play, and you can actually set up some nice combos that reminds me a little of Mage Knight (but don't get carried away with that comparison).  So the card play was fun, but it mostly just boiled down to moving and dealing damage.

This game is fun and unlike the endless variations of the same old "new" games we see every year -- Heroes Wanted isn't an adaptation of an already done game or mechanic.  My girlfriend will HAPPILY play this "combat" (it's not really) game despite some of the drive being to attack things.  She has never enjoyed nor wanted to play again a game with attacking.  Again, it's not really a combat game, Heroes Wanted is so much more and it is something that must be played to fully grasp its awesomeness and originality.  How do you describe the taste of chocolate to someone who has never tasted chocolate before?  Exactly...

My expectations were low, and they were exactly met.  The gimmick of combining words to create a superhero name is cute, but does not carry the game.  The components are shoddy, the rulebook is poorly written, and the game itself is only ok.  During the game, I just felt like I was doing the obvious thing after doing some calculations of things I couldn't plan ahead about.  When there was planning, it was obvious.  Mostly, the game was fiddly, and took too long and too much AP for the depth it provided.  The optimization problem is ok, but without much real interaction between players or stategic planning, it's mostly just a puzzle about figuring out the optimal way to play your hero, then doing it over and over and over.

Most of this is just walking around dealing damage/taking damage repeat. The hand management isn't that interesting. Every turn feels more or less the same, unless you need to cycle your cards, but that's always the same. The Quirks are more annoying than fun. I'm not sure why heroes are trying to hurt their teammates.

RATING: 8
This game is all about the silly fun.  It's not particularly deep or balanced or engaging but it's a great beer and pretzels game if you like super heroes.

The game starts by building your own super hero from 3 different head and body pieces.  In my first game the players were Captain Elephant, Alpha Knight, Ultimate Foot (my favorite of the group), and Captain Shadow.  You also randomly build a villain in the same way, we fought against Baron Von Caveman.  Each piece of the superhero and villain also has a special power or ability associated with it so every time you play you're going to be playing with and against a different set of abilities.  This is something I absolutely adore.

From there the game is played by discarding one of the cards in your hand and taking the action on the card which could be moving, attacking, or activating your super power.  With some exceptions when a card is discarded you can only get it back by resting, essentially skipping your turn.  You also have to discard these cards to avoid or because you took too much damage.

Each time you play you use a different scenario and randomly selected set of headlines that dictate how you score points and at the end of the game whoever has the most points wins.  I like the mechanic of hand management and I absolutely adore the building of the random heroes and villains but the game itself is pretty simple.  Mostly just moving around and punching out bad guys (or fellow heroes, this is not a cooperative game) to get the most points.  This makes it accessible as well as just great fun.

The other really fun thing is you can also play with quirks.  Quirks are cards with silly little things you have to do when certain events happen in the game.  For example one forces you to clap and compliment another hero whenever they use their superpower.  If you are caught not following your quirk you lose points.  Typically I don't like being forced to do silly things like this in games, it makes it not feel natuaral and ultimately isn't very funny.  But these fit so well into the rest of this silly game that it actually works really well and just adds to the fun.

Probably the most used word in my above comments is "fun", because that's what this game is.  A really fun, great time.

I have never enjoyed arena fight games.  They just are not engaging enough.  HW just confirms my view of these types of games.  I also had a major issue with my hero in that there was no way for me to heal my injuries.  That pulled my heros point total way down but even if I could have been totally healed I would still give this game this reating

RATING: 8.5
  I think the idea behind this game; that you are a minor league super trying to do WHATEVER it takes (including laying a beating on your fellow supers), to make it to the Big Leagues is fantastic. And so much fun.

  Whenever my boys and I have played this, we just have a blast creating our supers from the Hero A and Hero B cards. It is so cool to actually create a YOUR OWN super, and then comparing your super to see what the other players came up with. Not to mention the Villian. Our last villian was 'Sketchy Ham'. How hilarious is that?

  I've heard complaints that the scenarios aren't very interesting, but to me, this game harkens back to the old D & D campaigns of my youth, where the fun comes from actually playing your character. That's the fun part, actually role playing your character, and doing what you can to mess up the other supers chance at making the Bigs.

  I just got the expansion, The Stuff of Legend, and while we haven't played it yet, I wish more companies would make expansions like this. It's like they actually listened to what the players wanted, and included that in the expansion.

  For example, there's a new Threat marker, which may not seem like a big deal, but the old one was really, really small. So...bigger Threat marker. Next is the last scenario; an epic battle against 2 villains and their undead hordes. Awesome! And more Hero, Villian, and Super Power cards. The amount of supers you could create are truly staggering!

  I expect this game rating to increase the more we play it. A definite keeper, and worth every penny.

  Last point; this is the only game where my boys and I keep track of what characters we played EVERY game. I want to be able to go back and say "Remember the game when I played American Tarantula? And you played..." 

  Great game.

Perhaps it was that I was the only melee character in my game or that I did not really grasp how to play my character, but the game did not really make an impression on me. We kind of walked around mindlessly killing enemies, planning our hands to minimize how often we needed to rest, and taking shots at the villain when he walked by. The winner was the character who could make several attacks a turn every few turns.

Preliminary rating.  This game is an interesting mix of many different types of games.  On the surface, it's a slapstick, tongue-in-cheek superhero game with a silly theme and components, and some screw-your-neighbor.  At it's core it's a pretty calculated hand management game that requires thinking ahead and planning your moves well.  Together it's a game that lasts around an hour.  The feel of it is somewhat monotonous, but the humor fills in the gaps for the most part.

I am a big fan of games with variety. With 4 scenarios, random headlines, random villains, and lots of potential hero combination, it's oozing variety. Each game will have a different feel to it from all these variables.

Humour? It's got that too.

There is a lot of strategy and tactics to be found in this game. With a limited set of cards, having to decide which card to play and which to hold for defense is very satisfying.

Overall a solid game I will enjoy for a long time.

"Imposter! You aren't fancy giraffe or you would have sidekicked."  That is a quote from a game review that pretty much sums this game up. I love the Smallworld aspect of matching an adjective to a character and I like the card management of your actions. I also like the roleplay mechanic where you lose points forgetting to perform a character behavior. But, I'm not a fan of the fun house theme and breaking fun house mirrors. Not sure on this one.

Okay it's a really funny theme and I love the diversity of heroes that you can make. That's also awesome in terms of replayability because you will never get the same hero again. The rating could definitely go up in the future because I need to play it again.

My favourite Blokus, great for 4 and 3 players.

Seems to be hopelessly unavailable right now. A friend of mine would like to buy the game...

An excellent follow-up to original Blokus.  Takes care of the 3-player problem of the original.  Feels deeper than the original, although more plays are needed to verify this.

If you like Blokus, you definately have to own this one also. Trigon fixes the problem that arises when playing the original Blokus with 3 players.

In Blokus Trigon the strategy horizon is quite limited, since it is really hard to plan ahead. There are a couple of general guidelines for maximising the open for play area and minimising the potential for negative points as quick as possible, but most of the time your decisions are tactical and you play what suits the current situation. This is fine and keeps the game lighter. 

It is also great to see, that it is always a different piece that could have saved you, which is a sign of balanced game play. In other words, it seems that there are no plays that are "musts" or "must nots" in the early game.

Compared with the original Blokus, it is sometimes harder to see which way the pieces are played but your brain will adapt quickly. The biggest plus over the original, however, is that Blokus Trigon plays extremely well both with 3 and 4, and is playable with 2 players as well. This makes Blokus Trigon the most versatile of the bunch.

Improves over the original BLOKUS by allowing three players to game together without the involvement of a clunky "phantom player". In other respects inferior: the triangular pieces cause the board to become closed much faster than the original BLOKUS, making for a less fun game.

Was never a big fan of the original Blokus because of the huge board and the fact that it virtually required four players to match my interests.  Discovered Travel Blokus/Blokus Duo and loved that for two, acquiring a copy.  I think this is the solution for multi-player blokus, worked great with both 3P and 4P IMO.  Smaller setup, quick play, everything to like.  It would be nearly perfect if there was a small-board 2P variant without playing double colors, IMO.

RATING: 7
Plays 3 players better than Blokus.  The triangle shapes cause more brainburn, but there's not enough here for me to recommend this over regular Blokus unless you play with 3 regularly.  Personally have only played 4 player, which results in 1 player being crowded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Despite being easy to explain and quick to play, it still has great strategy and tactics.  It's also quite satisfying to see what you've built by the end--even if you lose.

And unlike the normal Blokus, it supports 3 players.  Awesome game.

One play. Seems like I prefer regular Blok though. Maybe we played it wrong, but we didn't manage to get to any sort of confrontation at all until the last five or so pieces, when we hit the outer border of the board. The triangles seem to make it to easy to slip away.

[i]Posted: 11/25/07, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Blokus Trigon[/i] is a classic example of a good idea being over-exploited.  The original [i][thing=2453]Blokus[/thing][/i] is a wonderful game that many of my non-Eurogaming friends enjoy.  It has nostalgia value for those of us who remember the video game [i]Tetris[/i].  By changing the "atmoic unit" from a square to a triangle, [i]Blokus Trigon[/i] loses the sentimental value, and some of its identity as well.

The game mechanics are still the same: get as many of your pieces onto the board as possible, and one corner of your piece must touch another of your pieces.  In fact, here is one area where [i]Blokus Trigon[/i] is different: when using triangles, it is easy to have a point touch another piece.  For the simple rules, this is sufficient.  For the advanced rules, points can only touch other points.  Even using the advanced rules, it doesn't feel as hard to place pieces in [i]Blokus Trigon.[/i] As a result the game play isn't as rewarding as that found in the original game.

I can't imagine ever choosing to play [i]Blokus Trigon[/i] if I also have the opportunity to play [i][thing=2453]Blokus[/thing][/i] instead.

A bigger challange than regular Blokus, but I prefer the original. The pieces on this one are trickier to place and I have a hard time seeing moves more than one move ahead due to the strange shapes of the pieces. Perhaps with more plays, I could plan like with the original version, but I don't know if it will get nearly as many plays in my house to get me to that level.

I gave this a go with the kids, and it was pretty fun, but I'm not much of an abstract guy.  I do have a couple that I enjoy (FITS and Ubongo).  I wouldn't turn down a play if my kids requested it, but I wouldn't be requesting this one myself.

A great new spin on what is already a classic game. One of the major gripes about Blokus is that it doesn't play well with 3. Well Trigon seems to play well with 3 AND 4.

The different shapes don't seem to add or detract a great deal from the game play. As ever, it is all about careful placement of corners. There is, perhaps, a little more flexibility in being able to place corners against sides - certainly the few times I have played so far, the final board has had far fewer empty spaces on it than a square Blokus board would. Perhaps that makes this one a little more forgiving for the newbie?

Fun, light 3 or 4 player game, but definitely not balanced as small alliances are made or seemingly random placement of one person skews the board.  I would rate it a '6' for 3 or 4 players.

Unlike what some reviewers have said, this game shines as a 2 player game.  I would actually consider this a strong candidate for a tournament type game as a 2 player.  Using your two colours in combination allows some great blocking potential as well as some agonizingly difficult choices of which pieces gives the best strategic advantage.

Unfortunately, I became so strong at this game that it is hard to find anyone to play anymore.

A nice variation from the original Blokus.  Plays better with 3 players than its predecesor.  The pieces are a little more abstract so it's harder to mentally picture them on the board.

So far, not as interesting as the other two editions (Blokus and Travel Blokus), even with three players. The geometry does call for different ways of thinking, but the general strategy of playing most of the big pieces as early as possible still works.

Pretty good abstract game, and I'm usually not a fan of that genre.  Good for when you want to relax a little bit, bit still want to rack your brain a little as well.

Basically, all you're trying to do here is get all of your pieces onto the board, while blocking your opponents from doing the same, with only one rule dictating the placement of pieces.  Very simple!

The weight and simplicity of rules makes this really ideal for a family game, as you can teach anyone to play and get them rolling in minutes.

Liked this one about the same as Blokus, although it was a little tougher to envision placements than the regular square grid.  I don't really prefer one over the other though.

The orientation of the triangles gives you more to think about in this game, but that also does make it less accessible to nongamers. It's not a must-have if you already own Blokus, but it's a nice variation if you play the original game a lot. Works a lot better with 3 than vanilla Blokus.

I liked the original Blokus just fine. Here, there is a nice 3-player version (which I think really didn't work with the original).  The components are similarly asthetically pleasing.

RATING: 5
I've yet to play standard Blokus, but this Trigon version was simply ok.

The simple explanation here is that you're trying to get rid of all of your pieces. This is accomplished by placing them onto the board such that they only touch at the corners. All of the shapes are triangles oriented in different configurations, and oh yes, the other players are trying to do the same thing.

I found thinking in triangles quite difficult, and it was hard for me to see the board. This makes me want to like the game more, but I don't think it's all that remarkable. Worth playing given its length, but nothing more.

As with Blokus, Blokus Trigon feels like it could have endless replayability. However, because it uses triangles instead of squres, it felt like it was a lot easier to use your pieces. Still, it's a great game.

Nice to have a version of Blokus that works well with 3 players.  After one play, I find this one much more challenging than regular Blokus -- it's harder for me to visualize the moves with these shapes vs. the square "tetris" shapes.  Perhaps that will change with more plays.  Glad I have this version in addition to the original.

Was fun initially, but now have more games we enjoy more. Keith is prone to AP as he is essentially "counting cards" when it comes to the pieces I've used - so it turns into a game that is much too long. I think I've only won once.

Preliminary rating.  One play with two players.  Piece familiarity is critical to enjoying blokus and the trigon angles are tricky to visualize.  Processing complexity is much greater due to the 6 point intersections.  Very difficult to actually block someone in or control their motion.  I'm a little concerned about that aspect.

A bit different, and maybe not so intuitive version of Blokus. It's much easier to visualize rectangles, at least for me, so I prefer the original. But for some change of pace, and for an ability of a three player games, it is still a nice addition to have.

Blokus is back!  Game play is the same, however now the pieces are shaped in various configurations based on the triangle.  I've only played this a couple of times, however it's as addictive as the parent game, and much tricker.  Perhaps this is just me, however I find it harder to visualize the moves and rammifications of moves, when compared to playing with the square based pieces.  Marvellous game.

It's hard to say exactly how "thinky" this game is.  One hand, you just want to play your biggest pieces first and save the smaller ones for last.  That seems obvious.   You can sort of block people, but then again, they can work their way through or around you, so it's only a partial stitching-up.   I enjoyed it as a casual playing filler, I wouldn't want to over-think it.   I'm not a huge fan of puzzley games, but this works pretty well.

I docked a point on BT for changing the subtle balance in strategy in Blokus. In Blokus, there's a balance between blocking your opponents while trying to achieve a breakthrough. But in BT, blocking your opponent is more important, which turns the game into trench warfare, as opposed to Blokus' 'blitzkrieg' style. But BT has one major advantage over Blokus - it can be played with a variable number of players. Blokus is stuck at 4.

Played 4P twice. Seems a little friendlier than Blokus -- most players were down to just a couple pieces by the end as blocking is less effective. That's not a negative, just a difference. The triangle-based shapes are also feel more novel than the square-based shapes of the original. I'd probably buy this over regular Blokus for 3-4 players.

This version of Blokus is a bit easier because there are six positions on each intersection instead of just four, making it that much harder to block someone out completely. It also scales better from 2 to 4 players (by taking out an appropriate amount of the outer edge of the board).

I'm a big fan of the original game.  This is a worthy and challenging encore which will take some getting used to.

Excellent and accessible just like the square version but I think this one's a bit more difficult to grasp.

I'm feeling a little hemmed in here.  Hey, that's where I was going to put my next piece.  Blokus Trigon is for people who want to improve their spatial awareness.  It works much better as a three-player game than the Blokus original game, whose pieces are based on squares.  Blokus Trigon takes a lot of getting used to because the unusual shapes made from triangles don't quite fit how you thought they should.  Good for kids and adults alike, Blokus Trigon is a short game (less than one hour to play).  You'll surprise yourself how you can squeeze in a few extra pieces as much as you'll be surprised how comprehensively blocked you can get.  Fun and challenging, Blokus Trigon is like Tetris with triangles.

I was really impressed at how this adds to the Blokus family. 

The triangles are not just a gimick. They open a whole new set of patterns that can form and they are more forgiving than the squares. Plus, the three player game is balanced and WORKS, unlike the original Blokus. In fact, I think this is the strongest of the Bokus family.

The three player game alone makes it worth the buy.

RATING: 8
I enjoy the regular Blokus and enjoy this one too. While the mechanics are similar, this one has a different feel. It seems like it is harder to block with this one than regular blokus and the pieces are definitely harder to visualize if they fit or not. I like that you start in the middle of the board instead of the corners. That makes you get into the action from the start. This is a different version that unlike regular Blokus plays well with three players. It might feel redundant to have both if you aren't a great Blokus fan.

I find the triangular shapes *much* harder to visualize on the board than the square-based Blokus. In fact, I often have to physically place a tile to see how (or *if*) it will fit. Because of this, the game feels cumbersome and too much like work.

The triangular layout of the board does mean that it works well with three players though -- a number that the original does not handle well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A little bit of a step up from Blokus, Trigon offers the same rules and experience, but with different pieces and much better play for three. I call it a "step up" mainly because the triangle-based pieces are more unusual and therefore harder to conceptualize. The ability to touch a corner point to a flat side offers a lot more possibilities than the original Blokus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The same game as Blokus, but with triangles.  Duh.  A bit more difficult to wrap your head around at first, but leads to the same place.  The biggest hurdle for learning is the orientation of the triangles.  Overall, I'd recommend Blokus original.

The little sister of Blokus--instead of pieces based on squares, the pieces are based on triangles. It combines elements of racing, area control, and efficient piece placement, while reacting to the uncertainties presented by the other players. Very simple, very fast, yet deeply profound, sort of like Othello.  The fact that it is a six-sided board makes this a balanced three-player game, which is not the case with the original Blokus. A wonderful abstract that is accessible to young and old alike. Solid components, with beautiful pieces too.

Changing Blokus to a triangular grid doesn't sound like much of a change, but it adds an extra dimension in allowing corner-to-edge play as well as corner-to-corner.

Actually quite enjoyable!  I haven't gotten to play it's square father, but my plays of this one have me intrigued.  I enjoy that there are really two versions to be played.  Do you allow connections to flat sides or not?

It really feels like a puzzle at times, but it has solid area enclosure mechanics.  Trying to cordon off your own corner of the pasture is the heart and soul of the game.

May08: After playing the original, Trigon is just the awesome sauce.  The increased permutations of the triangle pieces just put it over the top.  I'm also coming around to appreciating the balance between area enclosure and area access.

RATING: 8
25 plays - When I first saw Blokus being played I dismissed it as a 'family' game or kids game. Although that is true, it turned out to be more than that, it makes a great gateway game or filler game. This is quite close to the original and I will echo what others have said, a little more options for placement and a little harder to block. A great weeknight game, if I had to choose only one blokus I'm still not sure which...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] I chose this game as the one Blokus game to buy. The scalability aspect coupled with that it does "feel" deeper, really the optimal moves are not as obvious so you do need to think a little more which is good. I have found that blocking is possible but much trickier which means it is quite challenging and that is also very good too. I do miss the easy chances to block a little as I think that is my favourite part of the game (WOOHOO Screwage) but in the end I think Original Blokus is just a bit too easy so this is the winner for me. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u]7.5 => 8 This is a great little game and it gets my highest rating for a filler, much better than the original IMHO and scales 2-4 perfectly. It has also started to feel a little like a "friendly" wargame where you try to section off a territory for yourself while constantly defending it and then invading others at the same time, gives that feeling of wanting to do 3 things when you can only do one, especially if 2 people try to invade on your space at the same time. Blocking is very possible but quite challenging making for some good screwage and fun :P . I was origanally worried with this purchase as I prefer meatier games but this is a very enjoyable version that I'm almost always willing to play, its hard to turn down a fun game that only lasts 15 - 25 minutes.

I consider this to be one of the best and quickest gateway fillers out there as you could convince anyone to play, teach them in 1 minute flat and play in 20, perfect for families with kids and still fun for gamers to play and introduce others to the hobby with. My only knock is they could of easily made this for 6 players by adding 2 more rings and some more pieces. As is this is a great mix of a little strategy, good tactics including some 'friendly' screwage, fun and built-in replay.

[u]Tidbit[/u] - 2 ways to play with 2 players, 2 colors each or take the 2 outer rings out of the game and it works perfectly like Travel Blokus with 1 color each (you need to start at opposite ends though). 

[u]UPDATE:[/u]With only 2 players, one colour each and taking out 2 rings, ties are possible by both running out of pieces. Easiest fix, add 1 or 2 of the other colour pieces. :) 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Finally lost steam after 20/25 plays or so, can't fault it for that as that is a pretty good number however Rumis or Pueblo takes this idea to the next level if you want a little more. Edit - Rumis is not a keeper for me, keeping this instead

I like this better than the regular blokus which is also a great game as well.This game addresses the three player problem of the regular blokus game which was the only thing i disliked about regular blokus.I also like the variant rule which allows you to only place pieces connected by the points which makes the game quite a bit harder.

Of course this is very similar to it's older brother Blokus but the different shapes make it much harder to block and therefore a little easier to get around and slip (unwanted) into new territory.  Very good but possibly slightly less mean.  I think I prefer the original more but I'm also glad to have this version.

Was great fun and exciting to screw people over. Amongst the three of us, the stronger player eventually prevailed over the rest of us noobs, so the game feels very fair, yet we always felt like we had a chance up until the end. However, have heard that may not be as re-playable because it's a solved game. Until I get to that point, would still say I rate it highly.

What a disappointment. I remembered Blokus as a simple but challenging multiplayer abstract. My first play of the Trigon version revealed the dark side of multiplayer abstracts. If the other players join forces against one other player, this player is taken out of the game. Probably not the best play for all of them, but at least, nobody of the others will come out last. Also, going first seems to be an advantage unless other players take this into account when deciding on tile placements.

I like this better than Blokus, it's definitely more challenging due to the triangular shaped pieces.  Not that Blokus was too easy, but I didn't find it very exciting.  The same thing goes here.  The idea is cool, and I bet there's a lot of room for strategic play.  But it's just not the type of game that I find myself wanting to play.  Another good use for this game would be for 3 players, since the original Blokus didn't play that well with 3.

I don't like Trigon as much as the original Blokus - but that's like saying IBC isn't as good as Sprecher Root Beer. (That means they're both excellent for you near-diabetics.) It's more difficult to contain players and the starting places for 4 aren't as equitable given the game takes place on a 6-sided figure, but the game is still excellent. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that's not bored with the original Blokus - it remains superior - but this is still a game I'll play anytime, anywhere.

Good quick fun that just about anyone can appreciate. Placing one piece on the board each turn, players try to get all of their own pieces into play before the board fills up. The player with the least un-played piece sections at the end is the winner.

I wouldn’t necessarily say this version is better than classic Blokus but it’s definitely comparable and the fact that this one works well with 3 players (as well as 2 or 4) means it gets a lot more use.

Excellent addition to standard Blokus and definitely as good, maybe even slightly better. Although clearly not original, the gameplay and the triagonal shapes are different enough to make this a challenge. Blocking other players is more difficult, but still posssible! It plays much better as a three-player than standard Blokus (no phantom color), but it seems a bit too easy with three (one player will likely place all his/her pieces - and yes, we leave out the row of tiles next to the border). A lot more tension and crowdiness as a four-player game. ***** Belgian Champion Multijeux 2007.

Plays very similarly to the original Blokus except its based on triangles.  After a couple plays, it appears that its easier to get more pieces out and much more difficult to block people than in the original.  Easy to learn, easy to teach, easy to play...

An interesting variation is to work cooperatively in an attempt to play all the pieces on the board.  I know this is mentioned as a solitaire version, but it also is an interesting exercise with a group of 2-4.

I like this much better than the original Blokus - in part it's because it's harder to analyze the board position, and unlike the original, flipping a piece over or twisting it this way and that trying to figure out where it can go is a lot harder. I like abstract games in general, but I don't like pure abstraction - I like an element of "luck".

An excellent puzzle game for three or four players; good with two. The isohedral grid can sometimes be hard to negotiate ("why won't this piece fit there?!") but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple to see what fits and what doesn't. Much harder to block than in the original. Two player variant as prescribed in the rules is probably the weakest point, but similar to the Blokus->Travel conversion you can play it on a smaller grid with one color per player.

I don't give fractional ratings, but I would rate this just a notch below Blokus ("Blokus Rectagon," if you will).  I like the fact that the shapes of the rectangular Blokus pieces seem to make it easier to block opponents, which to me is central to the game (hence the name?).

Of course, others may like the fact that the shapes of the Blokus Trigon pieces are easier to get on the board despite what your opponents do.

The best version of Blokus for three players. The standard rules of Trigon (corner-to-corner and corner-to-side connections allowed) make it easier to get all your pieces into play compared to the original Blokus.

It's still a competitive game, just with a bit more of an open feel.

Blokus Trigon is like the original Blokus game from a slightly different dimension. All the rules are the same but instead of square blocks, Trigon uses triangular pieces and and octagonal playing board. It's still fun and enjoyable but I've found that it's easier to put all your pieces on the board compared to it's older brethren, thus making it slightly less challenging fare.

If you're looking for a new twist out of an old favorite then you might want to give Blokus Trigon a try. However, if you're looking for something new (or better) than the original, I'd suggest trying a different game altogether.

There's something about the Blokus family that's just pleasing to me.  Maybe it's the cool pieces, or maybe it's the clink that the bits make when they fit into the board.  Trigon is more fun than Blokus, I think, and it plays perfectly with 2, 3, or 4, which is a huge improvement over Blokus, which is (IMO) unplayable with three.

Together with Ingenious, this one of our favorite abstract games. We like this version more than the original one because you can always sneak through the pieces of your opponent.

An OK addition to the Blokus family of games - more suited for three players than the original (duh). The different shapes of the pieces do not add much value to the original gameplay - the difference is in the suitability of the number of players. However, three players is for us a bit of an odd-one out; when we're two players Blokus Duo is superior (even though Trigon is better with two than the original game) and with more players the original Blokus is better, thus Trigon will not find its way to my collection despite being a good filler.

RATING: 7
The triangles mean that there are more orientations you can place pieces at, and it's harder to wall people off - usually the 1-piece *or* the 2-piece will let them leak through. I marginally prefer the original game because it is more unforgiving.

RATING: 7
Ive heard a few detractors say that this version is too easy to get your pieces down and too hard to block others.  But this game offers intermediate as well as advanced rules.  The intermediate rules allow corner to side placement, wheras the advanced rules only allow corner to corner.  I beleive the advnaced rules diminish the stated complaint.  I like how this game scales so well to threee players by not allowing placement on the outer ring.  The original Blokus is much more of a headahce to scale to three players, though there are a few good ways out there to do it.  With 4 players, original Blokus has the edge, but only by a bit.  With 3, Trigon is better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The pieces are pretty (translucent, primary colors, shiny) and they have a satisfying way of clicking into place on the board.  The regular, square Blokus is the same, but I think the triangular pieces are better looking.  They could have been made a little thicker, to make them easier to pick up.  I really enjoy this game.

Definitely my favourite type of Blokus. Probably because it's harder to strategize and see different patterns here. Blocking is also a lot harder. Works really well with three players also.

Of course the same as is basic Blokus applies to this also: easy to learn and play but you still have to strike in appropriate situations.

3 player only, really. Harder to rotate the pieces in your mind than with regular Blokus, as there are no Tetris skills to call on. Bit of an odd niche product, but still a Blokus, if you're into that sort of thing. And I am.

Update: I now think this is better than regular Blokus, and thus it gets a bonus point. 

Update: But it loses the point due to its annoying box shape.

I really like Blokus, and at first this version seems less satisfying, as it's much harder to block and get a grip on. But the more I play, the more I feel I get it. Add the scalability - thi plays excellently (though differently) with 2, 3, or 4 - and the fact that you can make MUCH PRETTIER PATTERNS WITH TRIANGLES, leads to the inevitable conclusion : Blokus Trigon is the one version of Blokus that you must own!
(Edit April 2011): My comment above is no doubt weighted by the fact that this is the version of Blokus I have stumbled across cheap to buy. It has all the merits I have listed, but I think that there is an indefinable something to Blokus Classic - or even a definable something, which is to say that it is easier to block and to visualise moves. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
If you get bored with Blokus, this adds an interesting twist to keep your interest.

I do think Trigon plays better with three players than the original Bolkus, yet plays slightly less effectively for four players than the original... so I suppose in the end it's neither better nor worse - just a different approach.

This is a redevelopment of Blokus using a hexagonal board and pieces made up of triangles instead of squares.  It is a little harder to play than the original as the mind doesn't match up to those angles as quickly as it does lines (well, mine doesn't anyway).  The good news is that it plays three much better than Blokus.

RATING: 7
As a general rule I enjoy abstract games and have really enjoyed the original Blokus.  I'll start by saying that I enjoy this one as well, though not quite as much.  While it is fun, it seems as though it is much more of a challenge to pin people in.  It seems to me that it takes a whole lot of effort to truly block someone off.  I'm not convinced that all of that effort is worth the trouble.  Thus, it seems to me that this is less a game of positioning than its predecessor.  It seems far more important in this game to control space.  That is leave yourself plenty of options for piece play while limiting your opponent's options.  It seems this is much harder for me to do well than the area control in the original.  It doesn't make this one bad, just different.  Perhaps with a few more plays, I will grow to enjoy this one even more.  (Though I should note, I am still happy to play it when asked.)  [06/21/2008]

Maybe with a few more plays! If you are bored with the original, I do recommend giving this a try. It is quite engaging.

Blokus Trigon, I gotta admit, you're kinda a weird kid.  All the same, when we've needed a three player abstract with very little kingmaking, you've been there for us.

This is harder (more frustrating) than Blokus or Gemblo.  In those two games, you see the overall shape of the piece, and you find a hole that matches that shape.  In this game, the shape can match, but it still doesn't fit becuase of the orientation of the triangles that make up the piece.  I found that my brain hurt much more after playing this game.  Normally, that is a good thing, but it doesn't mesh well with the Blokus "filler game" feel.

RATING: 6
The game is just like it's relatives: players have identically shaped pieces of various sizes, each composed of a number of triangles. The hexagonal board is divided into small triangular spaces. You use a subset of the board with fewer than 4 players. Several spaces are marked: your first play must cover one of these spaces. When you play a piece, it may only touch your other pieces at the corners -- i.e., no sides should ever touch each other, and a corner cannot be placed next to a flat side but only next to another corner [this is a variant of the basic rules]. Take turns playing until no one can play any more pieces. The player who played the most pieces on the board wins. Ties are broken by comparing the size of pieces left - smaller pieces unplayed (fewer triangles) = winner. There's also a bonus for playing the 1-triangle piece last.

Good version of the game, although it takes some getting used to. But we already have GemBlo ... don't need another variant.

RATING: 5.75
Let me preface this by saying I like the original Blokus, but don't love it.  I marked it as a 6.  Trigon, to me, is much less appealing -- it is much less intuitive without seeming to offer that much more depth.  I'll stick with Blokus when it comes to this series, and will certainly recommend Blokus over Trigon for most players.  Having said all that, I can't really mark it much lower than 6.  It's better than "average", and certainly not "slightly boring".  Like Blokus, I HATE the plastic board.  Production value is just garbage.  A pity on that front.

A nice bit of variety if you're tired of the original Blokus but I think the original was more fun.  For me, it's harder to visualize how a piece will sit so it takes some fiddling around with pieces before I'm satisfied I've gotten where I want to go.  This slows the game down a little.

I love Blokus, but it's awful with 3 players. I'd hoped Blokus Trigon would be just as much fun, but support a broader range of player counts. Blokus Trigon just isn't as good, though. It's harder to block with the triangle tiles, which removes a lot of the cutthroat maneuvers that made the original so much fun.

This one is nice filler. Not the type of thing that I am ever going to get obsessed about. It's quick, and doesn't require too much thought. So even though it's a spatial skills sort of game, which isn't really my strong suit, I still enjoy it.

Blokus addict here, I'm always happy to pull this out. It's been a hit for me with family and friends. Again a victim of me owning perhaps too many games, so it doesn't see as much table time as I'd like. I prefer Trigon over the squares. Blocking is definitely more interesting here. Played with two, we shrink the board down by 2.5 rows. Alternating 2 and 3 rows blocked off. The board looks odd, but seems to provide a nice tight game. I prefer a board small enough that it is a rarity for a player to get all their pieces down.

Honestly, got this version only because regular Blokus wasn't available when I was shopping.  Personally, I like Blokus with the squares better, but "they" say that Trigon's better for three players (I haven't had any experience with regular Blokus for three, so I can't say).  

Whatever version you get, Blokus is a nice, easy-to-teach abstract placement game that should only take 20-30 minutes (unless some people--you know who you are--overthink every turn).

Simple, fast playing game until the end, where it can bog down. Still, it only lasts 20 to 30 minutes and for a game without any luck or theme, it still is a lot of fun, which seems like a paradox to me.

Unfortunely, it's not good with 2 players. It's too easy to have a draw.

Just Blokus with a different shape? Well, yes, but the shape difference makes you look at things quite a bit differently. If you don't like Blokus, you won't like this one. If you like Blokus, this is a good game to break up the repetitiveness of the original. Plus, its good for three.

Blokus Trigon with triangular based pieces is another favorite space filling game for me.  I'll always play Blokus Trigon if it is offered.  Getting the most pieces played out on an ever shrinking surface is the goal. (see Gemblo.) I know I've played a few games of this over the last couple years but somehow forgot to post (whoops.)

VERY difficult to wrap my brain around the odd alignments the triangle-based shapes can make.  All games decided with fewer than 4 pieces to go.  Sooooo glad I chose this Blokus!  Plays well with 3/4P, excellent with 2P.

A good re-development of Blokus by turning square pieces into triganles. Truely playable for 2, 3, 4 players, due to the symmetric hexgonal board and the redesigned starting positions. Basic rule (which allows corner touching edge) is recommended for beginners. Personally, I more enjoy the advanced rule (which allows only corner-to-corner placement) for a real play.
Blokus Trigon should be a better choice than the base game Blokus if you plan to with 2-4 players. Blokus is however more easily accepted due to its tetric-like appearance, giving players an illustration that it is easier to handle with.

Wonderful abstract strategy game that I think is a must-have for gamers. Lovely stained-glass tetris-like pieces, and a unique mechanic for gaining space where your pieces only can touch at corners and you can 'squeeze through' the gaps where others' pieces touch each other, the goal being to place as many of your pieces (hopefully all of them) on the board as possible. This is an improvement over the original Blokus, but this one's out of print, while the inferior original version is still available. Go figure!

I've not played Blokus, but I've found Trigon to be very enjoyable. You can think you've secured an area, only to have to fend off people on two sides. Remarkably easy to play, but the shapes of the pieces makes it a little tricky to visualise what pieces go where (which I imagine is easier with Blokus). Scales very well with 2-4 players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Same simple ideas as its older brother [gameid=2453], but now with triangles.  It has a better three-player version, but what it gains in options, it loses in simplicity.  It's much less intuitive to see what piece fits where, and how to structure a cut through another player's line.  The best thing about regular Blokus is its ability to grab non-gamers, and I think this loses a bit of that charm by making the plays a bit harder to see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A worthy addition to the Blokus line, as the new shape makes for odd play mechanics not seen in the square versions.  If only it was 6-player capable or had a more balanced board...

This seems to be a tighter version of vanilla Blokus, but at the same time, it seems to be harder to block someone completely in.  Unfortunately, it's not as intuitive or accessible as the main game, since calculating the proper way to align the pieces takes a bit more time.  It's different enough to warrant owning it, but for now, it gets the same rating as its pappy and its brother.

Blokus Trigon is an abstract strategy game from the makers of Blokus. The board pieces have changed from square to triangular. Game play is similar to Blokus, as players try to get rid of all their pieces. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one of your pieces already on the board at a corner.

RATING: 8
Identical concept to the original Blokus. Vastly better with 3 players than the original; possibly the best 3-player game I've ever played. The original is a little more accessible and has higher gateway potential; this one is tougher due to the non-orthogonal spatial reasoning required.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This seems less brutal than regular Blokus, since it's a lot harder to block people. The first time I played this, all three of us had a lot fewer pieces left than we usually do at the end of a game of Blokus. Still, it's basically Blokus, and it works for 3 players. I don't know that I'd pay a premium for this, but it's definitely worth tracking down for Blokus fans who sometimes find themselves lacking a 4th. I could even see this appealing to people who dislike the blocking part of Blokus, since it's a similar feel but less aggressive.

I don't like party games at all but I can abide this one. The gambit 7 chit makes it a big lottery on the last question but non-gamers probably prefer it that way

A really good trivia game. Some of the questions are so goofy nobody could possibly know the answers. But you can make an educated guess, and you can bet on the answers with your knowledge, your gut feelings or you could be playing the odds. Whichever way you play this game it makes for a fun 20 minutes. The short playing time is also a bonus, this game does not outstay it's welcome like so many trivia/party games do. Good family game! Too bad the components of this version look really cheap and crappy compared to the original Wits and Wagers. This is not something to be expected from Days of Wonder.

[u]May 2009:[/u] Played with the french version Gambit 7 (apparently there are some nuances, I don't know which).

The game is really fun, there was lots of laughter at our game. Some people thought the rue "only under answers count" was dumb, I think this is a nice thing, it leads you to take some risks...

[u]January 10:[/u] Played again over christmas (it's my uncle's copy). I like the game a lot, however, we found that the gambit token kind of killed the game and added a chaotic element we didn't like. We houserules the token (usable only once and just multiplies by 3 your winnings of the turn with no penalty if failed) and it worked better for us.

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 6. Big change for this game. I guess my rating really was inflated.

Something about it just didn't seem right. Okay, it's pretty cool that you can win without knowing anything, but then I guess it's just too random if that's the case? Also, it kind of sucked that if you had written 80 millions, and the other players had written 1, 2 and 3, and the correct answer is 79 millions, then 3 is the right answer... That's just a bit too much; I know these are the rules, but then I just don't think the rules are great!

Trivia game played over seven rounds.  Each round a question is read out, and everybody records an answer.  All answers are numerical, which are handed in and sorted onto a payout mat.  Players then place bets using their two generic bets, or they can stake their Gambit 7 chit to try for a huge payoff or lose everything.  The closest answer, without going over, to the correct answer wins and bets on this pay out victory points.  Very fun game, but the questions are incredibly tough - much more obscure than the companion game Wits & Wagers, which at least gives you a chance of knowing.  Fun game, but this version borders on frustrating, simply due to the question difficulty.  The betting theme of Wits & Wagers leads to a more fun atmosphere, too!

RATING: 7
Les jeux de questions-réponses sont en général, disons-le, assez chiants. C'est l'occasion pour tout un chacun d'humilier les autres joueurs, de montrer qu'il en sait plus, de petites phrases du genre "quoi mais tu sais pas ça ? pourquoi cette question est pas tombée sur moi ?", et autres joyeusetés. Ajoutez à cela qu'en effet, les questions posées sont souvent d'un niveau très variable qui rend le jeu très hasardeux et totalement déséquilibré, et vous vous retrouvez avec des objets ludiques qui, s'ils ne sont pas dénués d'intérêt pédagogiques, sont en tout cas souvent dénués de la moindre once d'amusement, sans non plus proposer de la stratégie.

"Gambit 7", lui, arrive à s'imposer comme un vrai jeu avec du rigolo dedans.

Déjà, il y a le phénomène des ardoises, qui rappelle l'école élémentaire et qui apporte un vrai petit plus ludique. Mais ce qui fait vraiment l'atout du jeu par rapport à d'autres, c'est que les questions sont souvent décalées sans être saugrenues ni tomber dans le graveleux, elles titillent la curiosité. Pour y répondre, nul besoin d'être un encyclopédie sur jambes, il y a une part d'intuitif, on vise la cible complète et plus uniquement le cœur de celle-ci. Les réponses étant souvent surprenantes et inattendues, il y a également une assez forte rejouabilité, il est difficile de se souvenir de faits aussi insignifiants, on ne joue pas vraiment pour apprendre des choses utiles.

Enfin, l'autre plus par rapport aux jeux de question-réponse plus classiques, c'est qu'on joue tous en même temps, pas besoin d'attendre les réponses de tous les autres. Le mécanisme d'enchères sur les réponses et du "s'approcher sans dépasser" (qui peut se discuter : ne vaut-il pas mieux faire juste "le plus proche ?") est très futé et permet une certaine stratégie qui se base sur la connaissance des autres joueurs et qui induit une part de risque.

Le résultat, au fond, n'est pas le but du jeu. Le but du jeu, c'est de s'amuser en apprenant des choses inutiles qu'on ne retiendra pas tout en essayant de deviner qui est le plus à même de répondre le mieux, le tout en gribouillant des chiffres sur des ardoises. Un jeu qui peut réconcilier avec le genre.

Trivia "games" are inherently not games, but uncontested skill tests which compare players' abilities to memorize data which in turn tends to put players on an uneven playing field. The typical answer to that problem is to make multiple categories that no one person could be fluent in, or to add a betting/wagering system on top of obscure questions to minimize the value of memorization, but I find those solutions uninteresting. The best implementations I've found are ones that add en element of creativity via lying/bluffing that challenge players to actively use their brain and create meta-games rather than passively relying on their accumulated trivial knowledge.

The same rating and the comment as for 'Wits & Wagers':

RATING: 3
Gambit 7 is Wits and Wagers with some changes for the worse. It adds a chip which allows you to gamble all of your points on an answer. If you nail it, your points are mulitplied by 7. So the game boils down to everyone trying to horde a couple of points and then getting them muliplied by 7. For me it makes most of the game pretty pointless. I don't see any reason to play this over Wits and Wagers.

Love this fast-playing trivia game.

A nice party game where everyone gets to make guesses as to the correct answer (always a number) and then betting on which guess is closest but under. It goes quickly, the questions are pleasantly obscure, the game's good for a few laughs, and it's good value for 6 or 7 players, especially with the option to go all for broke and bet everything you have if you’re off the pace mid to late game.

RATING: 8
7+(6+); 3-21(6-7); 15mins

An inclusive and dramatic trivia style format: inclusive because young kids could possibly write a random numerical answer and bet on someone they believe may know it; dramatic because there are close calls (e.g 1 player put 120 seconds and the answer was 119.5, 0.5 more would have won him the game) and a hail Mary play (the gambit 7 chip) which can multiple your written score if correct or wipe it clean if wrong. But just as important as the inclusiveness and drama are the surprises (due to way off assumptions or bang on the money answers, or just the enormity of the answer) and the conversations the game stimulates. I also don't mind the mixture of measurements as it exercises and memorises conversion tables.

Gambit 7 is the de-Americanized version of Wits & Wagers, which I had already played and enjoyed. The betting rules have been modified somewhat and over all I think the changes are an improvement, though the board isn't as nice as the cloth mat in the original.

Trivia party game that I liked more than many trivia party games. Doesn't overstay its welcome - only 7 question rounds.

Kind of shoddy components though. The betting disks are thin slippery cardstock - real chips would work much better.

(I also played its original US version Wits and Wagers once, and found W&W to be far too US-centric, to a degree that not just the foreign player but the US players also felt that way. So I prefer and recommend Gambit 7.)

A trivia game I [i]can[/i] play with the wife!

Normally, trivia games are a no-no. With age & the ability to fake maturity comes a certain capacity to fill your head with a near-infinite amount of crap, which apparently gives me an "unfair advantage".

Now I get the chance to answer less than truthfully and switch bets late to score from other player's 'better' answers. Done skillfully, this is great fun - and gives my wife a whole new reason for refusing to play trivia games with me. They do say its important to keep a marriage fresh.

I had great hopes for this game as I normally hate trivia games as I never know the answers and often struggle with the questions.  With this game you don't need to know the answers just bet on the person or answer you think is right.  So I liked it very much in the beginning but my form of not doing very well at trivia games returned quite quickly so it's not a game I play a lot.  I do like the way the questions are so random and everyone appears to struggle with the answers at times.  And I like that each answer is a number.

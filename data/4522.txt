[Children's Game] 
Another very nice looking game from Selecta, component wise. The theme is great for young girls with ladybugs getting dressed up for the party. Be warned though, this game has lots of little pieces so keep it away from the real young ones however good luck with this since they are all in bright, attractive colors. This is essentially a cooperative game with a memory element to it. However you have to be VERY careful with the rules. If you don't do the swapping of the color pieces exactly as it says in the rules then the game can lock up to where you can't finish or at least make it impossible to win. Probably not a good choice for situations where you'll have young kids playing against each other without adults present. But if you can get around that little quirk there is a decent coop game here to play with your kids.

Very nice indeed. My 5 year old daughter loves it, and I like it too. Some kids games I have to be a bit forced to play, this one I will happily sit down and play with little hesitation. It's cooperative, so hard feelings are kept to a minimum.

Context: As a dad, I created this account solely for rating kids games as to how good they are to play with actual kids. It didn't seem right to evaluate them vs. the strategy games I rate on my main account, so if you look at this account's other ratings, they are completely ratings for children's games. Based on play with a 2.5 year-old:

The box says 4+, but this is pretty easily playable for my 2.5 year old. The board starts full of ladybugs with various colored spots. They start the game each with a set of 5 of the same colored spots, but they all want to have 5 different spots, and must trade with each other to do so.

On your turn, you spin a spinner. If you land between petals, an ant makes his way toward the party. If all the ants make it to the party before you win, the game is over and you lose! However, if you land on a flower petal, you get to move the ladybug from that petal, and put him nose to nose with another ladybug of your choice. All the ladybugs have little magnets in their noses. If they attract, the ladybugs like each others' colors, and they trade a spot. If the ladybug spins away (they made the bottoms of the ladybugs slightly convex, so they easily spin when the magnets repulse), they refuse to trade.

So, the game is a game of remembering which ladybugs aren't fans of each other. Of course, with 8 ladybugs, they simply inserted half the magnets one way, and half the other, so each ladybug will like 4 of the other ladybugs, and disllke 3 of them. It can be a bit challenging some times to remember who doesn't like who!

My son was enthralled with how the ladybugs either like or don't like each other. Not knowing how magnets work, I think he either thinks it's magic, or that the ladybugs are real, and actually have like or dislike for each other!

There are both pros and cons with this game.

First of all I am glad we own it, and I enjoy playing it with the kids.  It is colorful, has a great theme and components, and plays quickly.  I like co-op games for this age of child, of which this is one.  It employs some deduction & memory, and works with color sets.

My objections are that it is very fiddly setting it up, and the pegs are very small and difficult for small or large fingers to pick up, which also makes them easy to drop & loose.  If it weren't for this I would have rated it higher.

Initial Rating: 2.0 (May 2016)

The Ladybug's Costume Party is a children´s game and I almost never play those, so I’m not sure how to rate it. In one hand I feel it is unfair to it rating it according to my usual standard. In the other hand I feel it complicates things for me rating different games with different measurement sticks, so at the end I decided to use my usual standard, thus guaranteeing, that it will be very low rated. That’s not to mean the game is a bad game, it’s just a bad game FOR ME. As I almost never play this kind of game, I think this issue will be short-lived and I will try to comment about it every time it arises. 

The game is very easy to learn and teach. It is intended for kids of about 4 years of age and The Ladybug's Costume Party is a complete success with them.

The game components are gorgeous and each ladybug has a magnet on its nose. The game is, obviously, very easy, in fact I think it is (almost) impossible to lose and, as it is a cooperative game, all children will have fun winning it every time.

It teaches pattern recognition (colors) and it has a bit of memory as well.

Bottom line, I think The Ladybug's Costume Party is a good introductory game for children.

Rated according to my 2-year old's perspective.  I think she's a little too young for the game.  I did most of the movement and spot exchanges myself, with prompting from her.  Magnetism is a great idea that could be used more in kids' games, but I think it actually scared her a little bit.  It bothered her that some ladybugs were unwilling to exchange, yet she was delighted when they would.  I think as she gets older she will enjoy this game more.  I like that it's cooperative and can reward (though does not require) a good memory.

Nagyon jó kis gyerekjáték ez. Gyakorlatilag az első, amit a lányunkkal tényleg rendesen tudtunk játszani társasjátékként. Már csak ezért is le a kalappal előtte, nagyon jó, hogy kooperatív. Felnőttként persze nem túl nehéz rájönni, hogy melyik katicabogár melyikkel van barátságban, és melyikkel nem, de hát ez ilyen. :) Mindenféleképpen nagyon jó az alapötlet és a kivitelezés is, jópofa az időzítő is, bár szerintem kicsit túl könnyű lett. Ami mondjuk gyerekjátéknál nem feltétlenül baj.

A nice memory game with a little bit of problem solving my only complaint is the spinner, I am not a fan of them as they never seem to spin true (my one scrapes the board even though I have fiddled with it in an effort to lift it clear) and the board gets scratched very easily with lots of nails scraping the board when the spinner is flicked - a 10 sided dice may have been better (1-8 coloured beetles, 9 - 10 ant movement) however this is the adult in me, the kid in me says that is a lovely colourful game with magnets and it is fun.

Cute! The ladybugs who don't like each other and just turn away are neat. Magnetism rocks. The game - well, I guess it's not bad for the 3-4 year olds. Co-op, which is a bonus in the age group. Bit too easy when adults are playing with kids, that's a small minus.

Indifferent.

[Children's Game] Cooperative memory game for very small children. I suppose this would work very well if the players were young enough to get enjoyment and suspense from the magnetic gimmick.

Definitely needs small children to be playable, and is pretty pointless if all players are at least seven years old. I'd probably rate this higher if I had the opportunity to play this with young enough  players.

There are lots of easily disappearing tiny pieces but luckily lots of spare parts are included.

Jogo cooperativo muito ternurento e com componentes de uma qualidade soberba. A jogabilidade é muito agradável, ainda que bastante simples, sendo fácil de colocar a jogar até os mais pequenos, que não conseguem ficar indiferentes nem ás joaninhas, nem à sua tarefa de irem ao baile, para a qual têm de distribuir beijinhos da forma mais correcta. Na essência é um jogo de memória, com um twist que o faz esquecer. Foi Jogo do Ano infantil em 2002.

Kids love the attraction of the magnets and have fun trying to figure out if the ladybirds will like each other.  Game is "easy" enough that kids can play by themselves and have fun.  For adults, the game isn't that challenging as once the pattern of matching ladybirds is known - game is simply a race against a spinner to "win".  Pace of ants arriving is so slow that it is actually very difficult to have the ants win.

This is a brilliant family game!!  It's disturbingly cute, and with proper creative dialog between the ladybugs, it's quite hilarious for little kids when a ladybug refuses to swap colors.  Additionally, with the distraction of children, it can actually be a little challenging to keep track of which ladybug likes which, an effect that is enhanced by ladybugs bowing out after they've gotten four other colors.  In other words, you don't necessarily expose all the information quickly.  In a family setting with at least one little kid (my two are 2Â¾ at this stage), this is a very fun little game!  Also, except for a spinner that serves to randomly select a ladybug to go swapping and to provide tension from the game's enemy AI, the game is entirely choices and memory.

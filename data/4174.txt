Juego de multitud de puteo. Roles repartidos a cada jugador de cada personaje, con una habilidad diferente cada uno, en un bote salvavidas, con otro personaje que amas y otro que odias (en secreto) (que alguno puede ser uno mismo). Fase 1: Se roban cartas de provisiones en un draft en orden de asientos.
Luego en ese orden cada jugador puede: 
-Remar (elegir 2 cartas para que puedan ser elegidas o no al final de la ronda, que crearan heridas a los demás).
- Robarle una carta a otro, o
- Cambiar tu posición del asiento del barco (de proa a popa) 
En estos dos últimos casos si el jugador objetivo se niega, se inicia una pelea, y todos los jugadores se unen a un bando u otro, se suman sus tamaños para ver el ganador. Los que pierden reciben una herida. Y sucede o no el robo o cambio de asiento. 

Por último el jugador sentado en la popa, saca las cartas del mazo de remo, las que dejaron quien remó, y elige una: En ellas indica quien recibe heridas (por la borda, por tener sed, o por sed por tener un marcador al haber luchardo y/o remardo previamente este turno)

Al final si sobrevives, sumas los puntos de supervivencia de tu personaje + los de supervivencia del amado si sobrevive + el tamaño del odiado si muere + puntos del botín acumulado en el viaje de las cartas que conserves. Gana el que más tenga.

El juego es muy divertido, mucho, puede que los personajes estén muy desbalanceados, pero todo depende de la partida, y los roles amado-odiado que toquen. influye bastante el azar de las cartas que salgan, sobretodo las de navegación. Muy recomendable a 5-6 jugadores y sin ser jugones.

Fun game.  Took about two games before the table saw the potential.  Semi tohink you need more than 4 to play.  Although interesting both games got into a pattern mid game and so felt prolonged.

1st play: This game evoked a lot of lively discussion, backstabbing and team-building. Tempers flared a little and it was mostly in good fun. It does have player elimination which is a big no-no for me. Next time I'll have to stay out of fights a little longer.

2nd play: I enjoyed the second play a lot more. I didn't get eliminated stupidly, I formed good alliances and almost won the game. I was able to get an ally on my side and we took control of the boat. The game is still a little long, and it's a pretty mean game. I enjoyed the game, but I won't proactively seek it out.

RATING: 7
This game manages to nicely create some fun social interactions and trash talk between players as the players try to survive on a lifeboat.  This nicely thematic game works if who are looking for a light game that produces funny conflicts between players. For my tastes, the game goes on a bit too long, and as such, should probably be played until perhaps 3 seagulls appear rather than 4.

If you don't look out, this game will allow players to figure out how fights will end before they start, leading to a game where nothing happens. Regardless, I think this is a great example of hidden loyalties and semi-cooperative play. And it's distinctly thematic - you can imagine how crotchety and greedy thirsting survivors of a shipwreck would be. The characters are even more wretched than you can dream.

I see what they were trying to do here, and I love the idea of having hidden agendas.  The problem is that there are multiple ambiguities in the rules as written.  Also the game can become player elimination and certain players can end up sitting around and watching for a long time before the game ends.  The game runs on too long as well, and doesn't have enough variety to keep things interesting.  I still think there is some fun to be had with our youth, so I won't be getting rid of the game any time soon.  However, I will have to clarify a bunch of rules before trying to play again.  Not recommended for groups that can't handle being mean and nasty to one another.

Juego sencillito a medio camino entre filler y party game. Una serie de personajes han sobrevivido al naufragio de un transatlantico y comparten lancha salvavidas a la deriva en el mar. Cada jugador lleva un personaje y cada personaje tiene una carta de otro personaje al que ama y otro al que odia. si al final de la partida el amado sobrevive y el odiado ha muerto se reciben puntos.  Durante la partida se pueden iniciar luchas, remar, etc.. con ello puedes quitar puntos de vida a tus oponentes, cambiar de sitio en el barco, o hacerte con cierto equipamiento.  En cada turno hay un evento que puede hacer que algunos personajes caigan por la borda, o pierdan puntos de vida. También regula la duración de la partida.
Juego sencillo y sin pretensiones. Para pasar un rato está bien. Jugable a partir de 5 jugadores. Con menos es mejor jugar a otros juegos.

Now here's a hidden alliances game done right.  I usually stay away from werewolf style games like this, but Lifeboat is more like Bang, using cards to construct the narrative instead of petty meta-personal rivalries.  Throw in a co-op survival mission to give everybody reason to work toward a common goal as well, to look beyond just their own self interest.  This could have gone horribly wrong, but instead did many things very right.  I might buy a copy if I found it for cheap.

I enjoyed this one more than expected, although I suspect it would be less fun if you weren't either the first to choose goods or the guy that navigates the boat.  I got to navigate pretty much the entire game, so maybe that swayed my opinion a bit.  Nevertheless, half the fun is the crazy love triangles between the castaways and seeing the story of who loves and hates whom develop!  It was also fun to knock the person I loved unconscious to loot him just as the boat was about to get to shore!  It was a fine balancing act between keeping him alive long enough to survive, but also stealing crap from him so he wouldn't get too many points.  Overall, a good little game that I would rather play than Bang!

Light game with not much player control possible with some characters being much weaker than others. Can be frustrating to die early on as although you are technically still in the game you have been eliminated and are very unlikely to win and the game can drag on for a long time if no one bothers to row (and frankly why would they when it just makes you extra thirsty and hastens your demise).

Lifeboat is one of the few games I actually regret buying.  The first red flag is that it requires 4-6 players, so your 2-3 player setup is right out.  It has a weird premise that you're on a lifeboat trying to survive and compete with the other players, but it's almost purely antagonism. You spend your time bullying the other players and getting in fights. 

I've gotta say, there's a difference between trying to out-compete your opponent in a game, and just purely pummeling them.  Competition can be enjoyable when you feel like you're building up to something, but the end-goal in lifeboat, even if it is survival, doesn't feel like you're progressing your character.

None of the times I've gotten a group together and attempted to play this game have been successful.  Everyone has quickly gotten bored with the concept, and wanted to move on to something else.

This has one of the worst sets of rules I have ever come across. To be fair the designer is quick to respond to all questions on bgg. But seriously, for a really simple game the rules sure over complicate it.

Go to the files and download the player aids first!

The pyschopath seems a little too powerful...need to play more to see for sure.

Need the right group for this one - this is definately not for the player who doesn't like to be disturbed!

Great game!

Suuuuper fun game!!!

I am into this because of the deliberations and haggling with other people surrounding fights, muggings, and switching seats. And I like messing with people.

One thing that is a little annoying to me is the rules tend to be a bit vague. Usually what we do is deliberate with whoever is playing when an issue comes up, then keep that rule for the rest of the game. Sometimes we refer to decisions from previous games.

Another con: I recognize that some people do not like to be messed with in their games. Players are trying to kill each other's characters off, and when successful, can make victims sour. 9/10 for sour friends

Partijáték, hasonló, mint a Bang és az Aranyásók. A mi társaságunkban nagyon bejött és szerintem is rendben van! Mivel mindenki csak egyszer akciózhat gyors, a harcok miatt élvezetes, a téma miatt pedig hangulatos a játék. Szerintem méltatlanul kiszorult a top 1000-ből. Nagyon jó játék! :)

Update: csökkent a pontszáma, mert túl kevés akciólehetőség van, sokszor egyértelmű minden. Nehezen indul be a játék, és ha nem szerencsés a Szeret-Gyűlöl lapok kiosztása, egyenlőtlen küzdelmek alakulhatnak ki, sokszor lehetetlen feladatokkal...

(5-6 jugadors)
Després d'un naufragi, 6 persones naveguen en un bot salvavides intentant arribar a la costa... però lluny d'ajudar-se, alguns intentaran matar-se entre ells.
Cada jugador representa un personatge (públic) i se li assignen (en secret) dues cartes, una d'amor i una d'odi.
L'objectiu de la partida és tenir més punts que els demés quan s'arribi a la costa. I els punts s'obtenen:
- sobrevivint un mateix
- si sobreviu el teu ser estimat
- si mor el teu ser odiat
- amb cartes de diners / joies / quadres
Hi haurà armes, flotadors, aigua per beure (per evitar la sed causada per baralles, pel sol i per l'esgotament), es llençarà tripulants per la borda i apareixeran taurons.
Es poden donar combinacions curioses amb les cartes d'amor/odi: 
- Si t'estimes a tu mateix ets un Narcissista (i dupliques els teus punts de supervivència)
- Si t'odies a tu mateix ets un Sociòpata (i puntues més com més gent mori).
- Si odies i odies una persona, ets Ambivalent (i puntues segons fas que aquella persona visqui o mori).
- Si t'odies i t'estimes tu mateix, ets un Sociòpata-Narcissista (i llavors puntues per la teva supervivència i per cada personatge mort).

A part del nostre personatge (que cadascun tindrà una habilitat especial) podem assumir diversos rols: si som l'Oficial d'Intendència (jugador viu/conscient més a prop de Proa) podrem robar la millor carta de provisió. Si som el Navegant (el jugador viu/conscient més a prop de Popa) robarem la pitjor carta de provisió, però podrem controlar el destí del bot.

A més, hi haurà robatoris de cartes, canvis de lloc (per canviar de rols), pactes, traïcions, assassinats...

Lifeboat is an intriguing little game. There are certainly some interesting concepts there. I like the love/hate aspect, I like the negotiations, but there are stuff I really dislike. There are turns that you do nothing, you might stay unconscious for half a game and it takes forever until your turn comes again. If it was a little bit more streamlined, it would be a much better game.

This is one of the most thematic game that I have played. I really feel like I am on a lifeboat fighting for survival. The mechanics are clever and mostly thematic. It's a pretty aggressive game. (It's pretty awkward pulling someone back on board after having dumped a bucket of chum on their head. It's best to pretend it was an accident.) The fighting mechanism is similar to Munchkin. I like that the game requires some negotiation. The game is a little scripted, meaning your strategy is pretty much defined by which character you are. I feel more like I'm acting out a role in a movie than playing a game, but that's fine with me because it's an exciting movie.  It's a bummer to die early in the game, which is not unusual for The Kid. Why am I trading this game? My wife and others in my group will not play it (too mean), so that pretty much eliminates any chance I have of ever playing it again. 

Now that I go to a board game meet-up, I'm regretting the fact that I got rid of this. I think I could have gotten it played some more. :(

Basically it’s a social deduction game with only take-that mechanics to keep your head above water.  The roles randomly handed out to players also seem unbalanced.  The game lasts longer that what it should for this type of ‘party’ game and since there is player elimination, someone could be sitting out for a good 30 min+.   
If you are looking for a social deduction game, there are better ones out there.  I would recommend “Samurai Sword”(2012)/”Bang”(2002)!  I even remember Shadow Hunters (2005) being a better game than this thing.   
Maybe I’m being harder on this game than warrants since I only played it for the first time around 2013 and the game came out LONG ago in 2002.  Maybe it was fun for its time, but these days, it should go out-of-print and STAY out-of-print.  UPDATE: BUT, looking it up now, “Bang!” also came out in 2002 (I never realized that game was so old) and that game is infinitely better than this thing.   However, I would recommend playing “Samurai Sword” (2012) over “Lifeboat.”  Its time to retire “Lifeboat” to the world of terminally out-of-print games.

Neat and rather quick negotiation game (takes around 30-45 mins in my group with 5-6 players). Really a 5 or 6 player game and it requires a good deal of the love and hate cards for a really entertaining game. In essence it delivers what games like City of Horror do, but in a smaller package. Who are you going to share your limited resources with, and whos demise are you going to try and create. Lots of table talk and betrayal.

(As of [b]3[/b] plays) Amusing game. There's not much going on beyond the general squabbling in between players, and alliances, negotiation and betrayal don't naturally happen as much as they do in other, similar games, but the theme and the gameplay is inherently hysterical. It is vital to have the right kind of group when playing this. Even one or two "off" players will dampen the mood.

One play of this so far that was a hit, though I can definitely see other plays of it being a miss. Seems to be a fragile game that can be a lot of fun or it can fall flat. I highly recommend role-playing your characters using funny voices to help evoke the silliness of the affair.

First off, it’s a 6P only game to me; you want the full complement for max chaos and negotiation as that’s what this game is about. White it is a negotiation game, the aspects that make it more than just a tedious meta-exercise in who wins are: a) each player has a secret character whom they love (keep alive and get points) and another whom they hate (kill and get points), and b) the items that you get. With the love-hate relationships to other characters, you’re given a direction to follow that helps reduce the meta-game aspect that can ruin these types of games. The items give a reason to interact (you can mug to steal items) as well as bargaining chips for negotiations.

Aside from the less than desirable documentation this is a fun, simple little game.  Lifeboat seems slow but then it ramps up as people start suspecting each other of gathering too many points, then things get interesting.

I can see this being broken and dull if played by pacifist gamers, fortunately we don't have that issue!

I have played this once and I was a little dissapointed. With 5 players there were 3 psychopaths 2 of which were also narcissists. This seemed to skew the game somewhat as everyone seemed to be trying to kill each other.

We finally seemed to get this game to work well by being far more aggressive ad brutal to each other instead of playing semi-cooperatively. That amplified the fun factor quite a bit.

This has a hidden role element that is integral to the game without an overwhelming central element. So you can play it without having a game face to hold your lies in place.

678- they say that the quality of the society you live in can be measured by the fear you feel after the power has been off for five days or more. This game, in just one hour, will let you run the gamut of emotions of greed to fear and possibly to love, while stranded in a lifeboat on a wide,wide sea. Survival is primary, but other motives may intrude. Since no one knows if rescue is at hand, one expansion introduces (abstractly) the possibility of cannibalism.           bon appetit !

Well, we'll have to stop calling Rette Sich wer kann "the lifeboat game", as there is actually a game entitled Lifeboat from Fat Messiah Games. And it's pretty good, for something with Cheap***-like production.

6 players (the one problem with this game is that it wouldn't work all that well with less players) are stranded on a lifeboat - each with a known role (the Kid, the Cap'n, the 1st Mate, the Lady, the Lord, Frenchy) and two hidden goals. Each player secretly "loves" another character and "hates" another character. (Yes, there are rules if you
love & hate the same person... or if you love and/or hate yourself.) You score points for getting valuables (money or paintings) safely home with you, for surviving, your "love" surviving, and the person you "hate" not surviving.

You can fight, row, steal... it's a values clarification class in action! And it's fun. (Even if I did have a rough go of it, thanks to the odd triangle between my first mate & Lady Lauren & Sir Stephen.) I think it's print run is out, but it's worth picking up for a group who likes this kind of light role-playing card fun.

Uno de mis juegos favoritos. Diplomacia, negociación y "mala uva". Cada personaje, sus amores y sus odios, hacen del juego una experiencia distinta cada vez. Los jugadores terminan metiendose en el papel de los personajes, ya que con dos detalles logran darles vida a cada uno.

A really fun card game with all kinds of hidden information where every player has to trade off between trying to control the boat and trying to get the best provisions, all while needing to keep yourself (and the person you're secretly in love with) alive and hopefully getting the person you secretly hate killed.

Joc de puteig i negociació, molt divertit jugat de forma inmersiva. Les cartes ocultes d'amor/odi incorporen molt interés al joc, a més d'un element de deducció. Els personatges son molt asimétrics i s'han de jugar de forma temàtica.

Té eliminació de jugadors, tot i que un cop començen a morir personatges el joc s'accelera. Poden donarse combinacions de cartes de personatge i d'amor/odi molt complicades per aconseguir la victoria. Si els jugadors no interactúen entre ells i no busquen fer mal al seu personatge odiat la partida es pot allargar masa.

The game boosts a simple but yet very intriguing rules set.   Life is very interesting on this boat and everyone's got their own agenda's to fulfill!  

It's not very hard to slip into the role of your character and treat this as a  short and fun RPG session.  Highly recommend and one of my very favorites for 4 or more players!

Played once (came second in a six player game). Just not the type of game i enjoy, but I tried it. I dislike all games where you can enter into negotiation but then go back on them - that has zero integrity.

And I get that it is "just a game", but why does that mean you can act without integrity (in this case, that means saying "X" and "X" happens)? 

As I said, not my type of game. For those who enjoy this type of thing I am sure it is something they enjoy.!?

Lifeboat wants to be a game of negotiations, unique play styles, and survival. Instead, it is a highly-unbalanced luck fest with player elimination. There is simply too much randomness causing unintentional or irrational results to guarantee that every player will get to (or even attempt to) make meaningful decisions.

It is a thematic game with solid card art, but it manages to be both boring and annoying - which means I have zero interest in playing it again.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (July 2013)

At first it seemed like a great game, I love the premise of the game, it has some aspect of games I hold dear (Oriente, Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg) so I thought I was going to like it, and I did but I thought it was going to be better. The game is very exciting at the beginning, however when characters begin to die, the excitement goes down. The game can take a while, which is very bad because some players can be eliminated in a couple of turns. 

I love the negotiation and backstabbing aspects of the game :devil: but I feel something is missing from the game. However there is a caveat, It was our first game, so it is possible (and likely) that the player who explained the game got some rules wrong. 

I will give it another chance to woe me, I want to play again, but I will read the rules next time.

I finally played the game again and I had fun playing it. Lifeboat is hugely dependent on the game group, The Hate and Love cards make the game different enough for me to keep it in my game collection (for now). It is not a game to play often, but I continue to be intrigued by it.

This game has a lot of promise, but not very easy to teach for some reason.  Could be a lot of fun, but it still seems to be missing something.

Traded 11/2006 for Top Secret Spies and Expedition

UPDATE: 9/07 Bought Gorilla Games nice version. Hopefull will work better now!

Played again and it seems I have been getting a few rules wrong... Will update once I finally play with the correct rules.  (Thats what happens when you read the rules a month before you play)

You can win even if you are eliminated - and players will be - which is what makes stabbing players in the back just so much fun. Requires players to be mean and combative

RATING: 4
There are a lot of rules ambiguities, and the easy potential for player elimination is distasteful.  Still, if the group plays quickly this can be a fun little backstabbing game.  At this point I think that I would always choose Coachride to the Devil's Castle over this if I had 6 players though.

RATING: 3
Potentially a great little card game that sadly feels underdeveloped.  Some good ideas here and if it were ever re-released with a little more work on the design I would certainly be interested in looking at the new game.  The secret love/hate cards are a great game feature even if being a narcissist almost guarantees a loss.  Artwork is fun with a dark sense of humour.  Cards are fine, while the other components are on the cheap side (2nd Edition).  

Too bad that more characters were not given in-game abilities to add a little more depth. The navigator seat position has almost deity-like and unthematic powers to select who gets thirsty, who goes overboard, and whether the life boat gets any closer to land.  With that degree of power, the navigator has every incentive to stay at sea and kill off the other player characters.  Of course other players will want the navigator seat, but many players will soon discover that they have no chance of wresting the seat and efforts to influence the row stack are worse than doing nothing.  The situation can get pretty ridiculous when only two players remain in the game.  What should be light fast-paced game (particularly when there is player elimination) is unfortunately too long, unbalanced, and anticlimactic.

Despite my low rating for the official game my gaming group does enjoy the occasional game of Lifeboat (including the 1st expansion) played with our house rules to better balance the play of the navigation cards and shorten the play time [navigator randomly selects a navigation card from row stack and secretly decides whether to play it or not; if card is not played then navigator randomly selects a 2nd card from row stack (if available), which must then be played]. We also add row and fight markers to facilitate game play.

RATING: 7.5
Great fun!  We are not normally a demonstrative group, but we had plenty of hilarious roleplaying with this one!  (2 plays with 6 players)
If you come in expecting it to be all about calculating the optimal path to victory, you will grow discouraged with your lack of control; but then you would have misunderstood the game... You do have goals, and there will hopefully be a winner, but your fate is always in the hands of the other players, so it's a social game, not an optimization game.

A downside is that the game goes longer than it probably should.  I can recommend 'The Resistance' as a better group politics game for most 6+-player groups.  For 5-6, I recommend the similarly-named 'Lifeboats', which has some politics and screwage but clean crisp rules so that the game never drags like Lifeboat can.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So much good fun. There's the automatic role-playing that comes with your character card, the oddly fortuitous provisions and valuables floating by your little boat, and the surprise factor that comes with the navigation card selection. The only thing that could be better is that the fighting seems to stretch on a bit with some players preferring to remain neutral and others tirelessly trying to convince them to take sides. We've solved the problem by counting down in unison with a finger hovering over each neutral card left on the table--speeds things up a bit. And who doesn't love a Bucket of Chum for company in choppy waters?

RATING: 5.5
Simple negotiation game that involves trying to keep yourself and your beloved one alive while ensuring the death of your most hated enemy.  The twist?  You and all the other players are stuck in a lifeboat together hoping to be rescued.  The only drawback I see is that players can be eliminated pretty quickly, which can be a big drag for them.

RATING: 6
This can be terribly fun or terribly boring, and is something that completely depends on your play group. Why? Simple: this is a nasty negotiation game, so it misses the whole point if people aren't negotiating and backstabbing when necessary.

The love & hate mechanisms is terribly fun and works like a charm, as it's continuously making and breaking alliances. I have the feeling it is unbalanced, though.

Regarding the components, the ones of the new edition are superb: even the life tokens are included, instead of the "find your own way of keeping track of your stats", very common in card games.

Also, not only the theme is very well implemented but is a very uncommon one. Not many games let you throw your pal to a sea infested of sharks arguing that was your only way for survival.

So, if you are looking for a game that runs in about an hour that is about negotiation and backstabbing, give it a try.

This was on my wishlist, and I won it off the prize table at BGG.CON!  Schweet!

After three plays (always with new players), at least one player [i]always[/i] gets eliminated in the first 10 minutes, and has to sit around for half an hour to find out whether they won.  I expect this wouldn't happen so much with people who know how to play (they'd be much more cautious about exposing themselves to injury), but for new players and casual gamers, that's borderline unacceptable.  I love the way the game looks, and the gameplay is funny and engaging enough (for people who aren't dead), but the unusually harsh player elimination aspect makes me hesitant to introduce this to more casual gamers.

Update: in my first play with my regular group (6 players), it went much differently: [i]no one[/i] died, and there were only a couple fights (but plenty of mugging, and only a little seat-switching).  I think it would go differently next time, though.  We liked it & will play again.

Lifeboat is a game based on player interaction that is highly immersive and feels very real (you really feel like you're on a boat where you need to fight over everything and pretty much everyone is out to get you).
Components could be a bit better though; there aren't enough birds and damage counters.

Played once, 6p.  Wow, I should hate this game since it relies so much on social interaction, but I really enjoyed it.  More than usual, any entertainment from this game will depend greatly on the players.  This is essentially a hidden role game, with screwage, and joining one team for one purpose, and joining another team for a different purpose.  It plays fast enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome.

Interesting role deduction game in the vein of Bang/Werewolf/Kuschfahrt etc.  My one play saw coalitions arise in the mid game and the deterministic combat system meant that there would be no reason to battle for several turns while one group pushed the other group around.  I would like to see a slight variable like a 6 sided die numbered 1-3 twice give the losing side at least some incentive to try to defend themselves or change the seating order.

Player abilities seem imbalanced (especially with certain love/hate distributions synergizing/not synerigizing with the player cards), and there are way too many turns where it seems it is best to take no action at all (if you have low strength and are not the kid). Drafting mechanic helps get rid of [non player] card imbalance. Some negotiation.

Have you played Mall of Horror? Bang!? Shadows Over Camelot?  This game will remind you of each of them, but it is very tight and self-contained as a game.  The mechanics and theme fit together amazingly well.  With the expansion, it can be played in an hour with 7 players, and unlike some co-operative / secret roles/agenda games, it's nearly impossible for one player to control the game.

Theres so much negotiation, backstabbing, bribery and violence in this game and I love every bit of it.  I would actually rate it higher but there seems to be a flaw(maybe it's just the people I've played with), it seems very difficult to actually kill anyone thus making it mostly a matter of who you get as your secret love to determine who wins.  Even with this flaw though the experience is thoroughly enjoyable.

Cute pseudo-party, pseudo-card, pseudo-negotiation game of 'surviving on the lifeboat.'  Quick mechanics once a few rounds go by, although game play is fiddly and probably requires someone very familiar with game.

A better than your average card game with some cool game mechanics. One nice thing about the game is there isn't a lot of down time in between turns because there are other actions taking place that can involve the player such as fights and players trying to steal their provisions. This also isn't one of those games where the theme is just pasted on but is a strong part of the game play.

The cards in the Gorilla Games edition are very nice with decent card stock and nice artwork. Much better than the old Fat Messiah edition so folks can stop worrying about the quality of the game components.

I'm always surprised by how much other people like this game, even non-gamers. It has to be a combination of the well-illustrated character cards and the theme itself, which is a good one.

There is always a lot of table chatter with this game as people try to form alliances, accuse each other, and plead innocence. Lots of fun. Game can sometimes drag a bit towards the end as people try to prevent the last seagull from showing up in order to gain more time to eliminate players. But maybe the people I play with are just bloodthirsty.

有著維多利亞式的嘲諷漫畫風格，每個角色看起來都讓人生出一股厭惡感。感覺真的該死不可，可說是跟主體很契合的畫風。其他配件普普，但是說明書實在是很陽春，就一張薄薄的白紙黑字，讓我以為是不是買到盜版的。實在是不及格的說明書。

規則與遊戲機制搭配得很洽當。物質由船頭傳至船尾，所以後面的人越拿越爛。但是控制船方向的卻是最後一個掌舵的(遊戲設定為一個小屁孩)。加上每個人有不同的生存分數，不同的愛憎對象，大大增加這款遊戲的互動趣味性。規則算是好教學且能融入情境。

配件簡單，但要分發每個人角色卡、喜愛對象卡及憎恨對象卡，安排物資卡、航海卡，但基本上算是很好設置的遊戲!可以很快開一局。

路線:0.2
遊戲路線不多，就是如何跟一群人在船難中活下去，並且想辦法讓自己愛的人活下來，憎恨的人死掉，簡單說就是靠嘴砲。但人面對死亡威脅時還是只會想到自己所以就算愛誰恨誰 似乎還是增加本遊戲的多元路線發展

互動:0.6
這個遊戲的互動很兩極，雖然有喜愛卡及憎恨卡的設定，來增加玩家的互動，但在遊戲過程中，大家還是會以自己生存為最大目標，玩的過程中很難體會出你真心想要幫助自己喜愛的人，不過憎恨的對象倒是比較明顯可以感受到。
   此外很多玩家搞錯了遊戲的最重要目"不是活下來"，而是遊戲結時"獲得最高分"。這個遊戲要活下來很容易，但要獲得最高分卻是需要策略的。不過大部分的玩家常常搞不懂這點，只想保住自己的小命，一但存有這種想法，那麼註定這場遊戲將出現一個平凡無聊的過程，大家不搶東西、不搶位置，不害人落海，不引發衝突，只等待卡一翻出來，是誰落海?或是出現海鷗。這種玩法玩下去還是別完了。
   假如你真的懂這款遊戲的精隨，就知道要依據自己的生存目標，想辦法搞死分數高於你的人(不是你恨的人)，這才是這款遊戲的真正目的，假如藥玩合作遊戲，還是不要選這款遊戲了!

個人:0.6
想跟真正懂這款遊戲目的人過招，不然這只是一款平凡的遊戲。

朋友:0.7
大家看起來很歡樂 大概看到我被分食掉 覺得心理很爽 玩了幾次可以多人同樂 算是6人以上party game 專用遊戲

想玩:0.3 
大概只能久久開一次 　因為大家都不太鬥爭 所以沒有刀刀見骨的感覺

I enjoy the game but it may be too vicious for most in my group.  I ended up killing the person I loved just because they would not help me beat up the Kid (who he loved).  Love is a fickle thing.

I've had this game be amazingly entertaining with lots of laughter and diabolical intrigue.  But it really depends on the group of players.  And getting dealt an ambivalent love/hate combo really takes the drive out of the game, which unfortunately keeps happening to me.  But the game has such potential that I'm willing to figure out how to recreate it consistently.

A dog eat dog game, trying to survive. Everyone gets a character they're secretly trying to kill and another they're secretly trying to save, so battle lines are drawn for you pre-game. Then it's a matter of encouraging people to help you take down or save those you have an interest in, while they're trying to do the same for their secret characters. So it's a game of many temporary alliances. Each turn, cards will be collected containing VPs and save-wound type cards, so you also may want to start killing off or moving the characters at the front of the line who are collecting the best of these, which skews alliances and proposed kills in a second form. Which is necessary and clever as it fogs people's real intentions. All in all, some decent finger-pointing accusation-type whine-fest fun, which can't be taken too seriously.

An all right game, I suppose, where group think dictates what happens.  Things get stupid when everyone dies and you actually have to keep track of which corpses roll into the sea and which ones don't.  Strikes me as being similar to Mall of Horror with fewer choices and not as much atmosphere.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game quite a bit. That said, I've played quite a few times (10+), but have never managed to even come close to winning. Perhaps it is due to the "friends" I play with, but I find that I almost invariably get targeted and killed... or I try to be very meek and not engage in fights with anyone, and then I get mugged to poverty. Perhaps I just lack the social finesse necessary to excel at this game.

The game is definitely more fun with more people, and, fortunately for me, the fun doesn't usually come from winning. Because, as sad as I am that I'm always dying, almost everyone else is dying of thirst and/or getting thrown overboard (occasionally with buckets of chum thrown in after them for good measure) as well. Thus, even if I can't reap the joys of winning, the joys of schadenfreude are in full effect.

That kind of vindictive happiness isn't generally my cup of tea, but anyone who enjoys it, and has a group of friends that they don't mind potentially losing, should consider picking this game up.

A twisted little traitor game where every player has a unique goal along with the greed of gathering the most treasure. The fact that each player has someone they want to kill and someone they want to protect. Especially funny when the one you love is the one who wants you dead! It can be a bit hard to sort out allegiances among the scuffles, especially among a group that really likes to get in fights, but I'm a big fan of the kind of chaos Lifeboat brings to the table. Always a blast to see who survives the trip.

The random dealing of cards can leave some players just out of luck (if small characters love themselves while a large character hates them... game over) so it's not completely balanced.

"Lord of the Flies: The Card Game."  This game is not fair.  The secret love/hate is fun, but the luck of the draw can hose you.  If you're a wimpy character and Bluto hates you and your secret admirer is another wimpy character (or yourself, you narcissist!), then expect to get rolled for your seat and/or provisions.  But so what if it's unfair; it's fun.  I think you need a full complement of six players.

Unique selfish, every-man-for-himself gameplay and interesting theme. The negotiations, character role-playing, arguments and hidden relationships are all hilarious. 

There are however some issues with the components. The rulebook is very vague and requires a reading of a BGG FAQ. The red plastic disks are also disappointingly of poor quality. Different tokens should be given to mark a character who has rowed and who has navigated. 

Get this game if you know your group can take the backstabbing, selfish and lynching gameplay and you're willing to spend some time to fix/mod components

The random assignment of love/hate can also be frustrating for some players

I am extremely, extremely disappointed to say that I was completely and utterly underwhelmed by Lifeboat. I have read nothing but glowing reviews about this game. Multiple people have said how it's a rare gem that nobody knows about, and that it invokes terrible feelings and cutthroat actions out of the players.

All it invoked out of us was pure boredom. Nothing happened in this game, and it wasn't for lack of want and effort on our part! There simply wasn't enough to do. One player desperately wanted to move positions on the boat, but couldn't the entire game, because he never got a weapon card, and nobody helped him. That really went for everybody. There was no fighting, because only one player really had any decent weapons. After the game I scanned the deck to see if it was just an unlucky draw, but there were only like five or six weapon cards in the entire thing!

It was pure domination by one player, with nobody else able to defend themselves.

I feel so betrayed, but not in the way the game promised I would...

EDIT: It looks like we played this horribly wrong. I'll give it a final review after I play it again by the actual rules.

Got it to check out the mechanics for a gaming project of my own, didn't expect much, but it was better than I thought. The most fun part is the banter and roleplay naturally generated by taking on the various characters in the boat. Some characters are notably weaker/stronger than others, though.

Diplomacy with cards?  Maybe, but add a love/hate element, and you get a better clue.  Players are trying to accumulate points by (1) surviving, (2) killing their hidden enemy and (3) saving their hidden love-interest.  Throw in weapons, money, items, and the ability to decide where the boat goes (which determines when the game ends), and it's all about negotiation.  The best part?  The love/hate interests are unknown to the "receiver", making it a guessing game who your friends and enemies are.  Would make a great small-party game.

[q="My blurb"]You don't remember how you all got into this tiny lifeboat together. Only that you've grown fond of one of them, and you want to survive this together. Even if he/she doesn't love you back.

Even if it means kicking people to the middle of the boat where they have no power, using weapons if need be, which you stole by mugging them.  Even if it means killing everybody else who's helping row the boat. Especially if it's that guy you hate with every fiber of your being for some reason (you can't control who you Love or Hate, can you?). He deserves to be thrown overboard, and have a bucket of chum dumped in right after him to exorcise the bad juju vibes. Happy shark chow!

Let's not get started with [thing=37036][/thing], yeah?

(I am NOT talking about [thing=249][/thing], which, though it illustrates the depths of human depravity with THE meanest mechanism of all time: voting, is too bright and cheery and dabbed over in primary colors to be taken seriously.)[/q]

I always thought card games would be an abstraction that stretched your power of imagination to varying degrees. Not Lifeboat. This is the [u]only[/u] thematic card game out there. The luridly awesome theme is so well woven into this one that you can even use "what makes sense" to figure out rules you're not clear with. That is the pinnacle. If this game got on your radar because of the theme, and because you want to backstab, mug, loot and kill your friends, then eat one of them if somebody can prepare the corpse, then... you won't be disappointed!

The game mechanics are not perfect. Fights and negotiation disturbingly remind me of Munchkin sometimes with their loose free-form nature. But the game has many excellent core ideas that still feel fresh nearly 10 years after its release: the love-hate relationships, the Rowing stack etc. There are tensions to balance: how far do you want to show that you love/hate a player? Is a big stack of provisions or not falling overboard more important to you? Do you dare put cards in front of you to have them be immune to The Kid's pocketing, at the risk of having them get washed away if you fall overboard? There is enough game in here, with the opposing forces tugging at you, for the theme to glue it all together into an integrated package. Only thematic card game out there, and it puts a lot of other "thematic" board games to shame.

Unfortunately, seemed like the game could have used some fine-tuning. Provisions always seem to run out early, rowing seems to get nowhere sometimes, and the actions seem too free-form. A little more structure and tightly designed cards would have helped. I get a sense that the game relies on people actually wanting and trying to survive, whereas in games, everybody's turning heel and trying to off everybody and leaving an unpredictable winner/survivor.

Experience is highly dependent on the people you play with. Between a 6 and 8 as a result (2 to 4 rating on 'play experience'). I'll err on the high side since this game isn't getting much love.

4+4

Nagyon hasonlít a Banghez abból a szempontból, hogy egymás ellen vannak a játékosok, ki lehet esni, igaz itt a halott játékos is érhet el pontot, ami azért kellemesebb. Egy mentőcsónakban hánykolódnak a játékosok és a partraérés közben megpróbálnak minél értékesebb tárgyakat kihalászni a vízből, illetve ellenségeiknek megkeseríteni az életét, barátjukra pedig vigyázni. Ez az utóbbi két dolog teszi szerintem érdekessé a Lifeboatot. Agresszív játék, ahol a túlélés nem könnyű, de van egy hangulata. Nekem kicsit jobban bejött, mint a Bang, mégis most hasonlóan pontozom, de úgy érzem később nőni fog egyet a pontszám.

[2012-03-03]
Marad a pontszám, mert a kiesett játékos akár 1 órát is várhat a játék végére, ami lehet elég elhúzódó. Ettől függetlenül a Bangnél jobban tetszik.

Game is a hoot, and I really like the love/hate secret missions. There's a lot of room for negotiations, threats, bribery, etc. and all of its fun. There are only "pseudo-teams", because saving your love interest isn't worth dying for. Darling, I love you, but I must kill you now. It's you or me! So when played by a good group who isn't afraid to stab each other for a nickel, then there should be a lot of interesting team shifting I think

I had design rating lower at first, but turns out that we got some rules wrong and there are possible rule changes in the pipeline that address most of my concerns so I'll give it more benefit of the doubt for now. I like the free-form of the trading, etc. but wish there were a little more structure in the alliances for mugging (i.e. Cosmic Encounter)

RATING: 8
A pleasant surprise.  Seemingly the lovechild of Battlestar Galactica and Resistance it does a lot with very little which always scores highly for me.  Possibly too cutthroat for a lighthearted game with people you've never met but it satisfied my diverse group.

The one black mark it deserves is for not having enough tokens.  There are some for wounds, but you also need markers reminding people who rowed, who healed...that type of thing.  Everyone is watching their guy, but when the player in the back is looking at the cards deciding who to screw over the information he needs should be clearer on the table.

This is probably the best game on Bruno Faidutti's Nasty Games list. And wow, it truly deserves its spot--it's ugly! No matter how the opening cards fall, they weave an intricate web of hidden motives, driving players to pick and take sides in conflicts when they'd really rather shut up and row. This is definitely one to play with a thick-skinned group. There isn't a whole lot of strategy that isn't obvious from the outset, but everyone will have fun.

Lifeboat -- it can go up to a 9 with the right group of friends.  While the mechanics aren't super, the game is really, really fun and will leave you with some great memories of backstabbing and joy.  It's a bit long for what we're doing here, but you won't care if you're having a great time.  *Update* - the more I play the more I like about this little gem.

Very chaotic game of beat up your neighbor.  The new version has nice production graphics and makes it fun to play with.  The love-hate relationships are a brilliant idea.  The difference in characters is pretty extreme, and the weaker characters get hit twice - combat damage and life points.

Backstabbing games can be fun, but there's something missing here.  I'm thinking it's just a bit too clunky and the negotiations here aren't interesting enough.  Perhaps more simplified, streamlines rules would help it hold more water.

Rating might go up if it gets to the table more.  Fight for boat position to increase your loot or to steer the boat toward land.  Try to survive as each turn players may take damage do to thirst or going overboard.  You have hidden objectives where you try to save one person and try to kill one person.  Interesting little card game.

Does the kid have any option other than to get beaten up on a lot? Yeah, he can steal back again, but that just resets the situation. Also, with 'chum' it's pretty easy to kill him off should you want to.

With 5 players we also had 2 players be dealt themselves as their 'hate' target, so we had 40% of the boat actively trying to kill everybody.

In addition, with one person 'loving' the first mate and willing to work with him in fights, he was an unstoppable killing machine.

You can see that this felt very badly broken. Down to 3 players it got only worse as 2 ganged up on the third so he never had any chance to do anything, stuck in the middle of the boat (didn't get first choice of weapons, kept getting mugged and then couldn't choose which navigation card was used). This seemed kinda broken. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial rating after two plays with four players, the game shows great promise and we will use as a filler from now on. Will review the rating when we play again, this time with one player more. It's hard to keep the players playing the weaker characters involved with the game, except when being robbed and beaten, though.

A nice and easy going game with a lot of conflict. It seems easy to form pacts depending on who is helping whom, but in the long run the most tactical player will win - with some luck. It is, however, sure that you will backstab and betray to get there. Do not be afraid to crap in other peoples' corn flakes - they are plotting to do the same to you!

This game was remarkably unpleasant. It's just a long drawn-out affair of nasty and brutal negotiations without any interesting gameplay underlying those negotiations. As someone who really enjoys Diplomacy, the fact that the negotiations and alliances in this game bothered me is saying something. It's because there's no game there on which the discussion is based, unlike the tactical maneuvering in Diplomacy. It's also ironic given my enjoyment of Diplomacy, but Lifeboat took far, far too long to play for what it offered. The randomness of the card draw and the capriciousness of the players got old long before the game ended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tentative 8.5, could go up or down. Seems like a very good design, does what it needs to and not a thing more.

Ok, drop to 8 after more play. That's because sometimes the game won't be interesting and sometimes players aren't going to have anything they can do (when their position is bad). This unfortunately seems to come with the territory of not being able to directly do what you need (and probably also with the random secret goals), which is what I like about the design. If a majority of the players could pick off the rest Survivor-style it wouldn't be nearly as interesting.

...Occurs to me that you could view this as a simplified version of Junta, but with personal goals. Look at the guy in the back of the boat as el Presidente, except instead of money he dishes out wounds or birds. If you don't like the "President" you can fight him for his seat, and fighting works similar to voting.

...Played 6p. I could see rating this anywhere from 6.0-9.0 really. There is really a lot wrong with it. If you play with a full boat (6+ players) the provision deck runs out rather quickly, and once that happens, all the seats are functionally identical (and thus not worth fighting for) except for the seat in the back that gets to play the navigation card. And if you go unconscious, it's highly unlikely you'll get to keep your loot, meaning points scored off of such cards are basically gravy for those who survive the game.

As much as I'm fascinated by the way that you are quite limited in how you can set out to do anything related to your goals, it can also be frustrating. And I think that based on how the goal cards come out at game beginning, it's quite possible some players will have no chance of doing anything interesting, let alone winning.

Two criticisms of the 3rd edition components: Not nearly enough red winks for wounds, and there should be a separate component or two for noting who fought or rowed, instead of using wounds for everything. Secondly, while the cards are of nice quality, some cards are colored slightly differently from others. It's conceivable that you could memorize certain card backs to narrow down what a card might be.

Your only hope for survival is to climb aboard a Lifeboat and head out into uncharted waters. But as supplies run low and hidden treasure is discovered, the passengers start to take sides. Protect your secret love, watch out for your secret enemy, and grab as much loot as you can!

If you are looking for a backstabbing negotiation game that only takes an hour and a deck of cards, Lifeboat is a good choice. While not as refined as some other games in the genre, it is one of the more heavily-themed ones; and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It does require five or six players to get the full effect, but the shorter time frame makes it more enjoyable and allows players to get into a fun sort of mean-spiritedness that might grate after a longer period. And being the Psychopath is likely joyless in life but amazingly content as you watch the sharks eat your opponents. You can have the jewels and money; I just want to stay alive.  See my review for more details...

I played this with 6 players and we were all new to the game. I pulled the easiest to kill character in the game (The Kid) and subsequently I was out first.I didn't stick around to see how the rest of the game played out. It's basically a negotiating game which I'm not all that fond of. I'll give it another shot and hopefully I'll be dealt a stronger character next time.

Survive at sea by cooperating with and confronting your fellow shipwreck survivors.  Demand, coerce, threaten, sweet-talk, rumble your way into favorable position on the lifeboat or acquiring provisions.  Not just a matter of self preservation, but one of saving your secret crush while vanquishing the one you quietly hate.  Everyone wants to reach shore, but as the situation deteriorates how much are you willing to do for the team?

Characters are unbalanced, so players need to play to character strengths.  Throw in random love interests and hated foes, suddenly motivations aren't so clear.  The game centers on the players' ability to negotiate the tight wire of self interest and collective need.  Great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
card game with both co-op and stab in the back aspects of trying to survive a shipwreck (ala the film lifeboat?) each player loves and hates 1 of the occupents of the boat (which in fact could both be yourself!), points are scored for possession of key objects, haveing the object of your love survive and your hatred die and your own survival

This is a 6 player game.  I would not advise playing it with 5; you REALLY need all 6.  With that being said, it is an okay game.  It seems to last a little bit longer than you would like, although once someone rowed, we moved on to the next player whether the rower had chosen which card to add or not.  Probably would be more fun if the players were more into the confrontation, and once we started playing more aggressively it got funnier and more fun.  My character died and still managed to come in 2nd!

Very weird game. You love one of the characters and hate another one. You could be included as one of those. The rules about who you love and hate make sense once you understand them but I had trouble my first game. When you pass out was confusing. When you fall overboard was confusing. I need to read the rules myself. I think the game play was fun but it is just a silly card game.

Замечательная кооперативная игра, несмотря на то, что здесь вроде бы все против всех. На самом деле здесь играют связки и союзы.

После кораблекрушения выжили 6 человек, постепенно разделяя припасы и определяя, куда плыть, они пытаются выжить, но не просто так - каждый из игроков кого-то любит, а кого-то ненавидит. Кто-то из игроков может ненавидеть всех и его цель - потопить лодку, кому-то может выпасть карта нарцисса - и он не будет иметь скрытых друзей среди экипажа. Игра довольно хаотична, в ней нет смысла пытаться выиграть. Она для процесса.

A little difficult to grasp, and grasp how to do well, yet is so immersive and thematic that if one is willing to just go along for the ride, a fun time will be had. Make sure to encourage trading and negotiation, as that is a big part of the game and will not make itself apparent unless it is actively pursued.

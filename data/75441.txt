2011-06-26 (rating 8.5):

So far I have played only one game and with two players only but I liked the game a lot and wish to paly it more. Probably in future after more games (which I will hopefully have) I will adjust rating.

As for now the game seems short with only 4 turns. This is good for playing time but makes lots of limits to strategies and vulnerabilities to even simple mistakes (as there is not time to correct them).

7,5 is my initial rating after one play. I definitely need to play more in order to adjust the rating. So far so good, very promising. However I think I won't be able to handle all calculations necessary to clearly estimate company's total assets. Looking forward to more plays.

What a curious bird. A shares game that, despite an additional layer of shareholding (companies holding other companies shares) oddly lacks incentive play. While it was that aspect that drew me to the game, what is ultimately intriguing about it is the input/output engine and how it intersects scoring in the very interesting - but perhaps very flawed - market board.

The market works similarly to Power Grid with the earlier buyers getting the cheaper goods, but the goods don't refresh; they are added by the players. This creates a Container-esque buyer/seller/competitor relationship that requires careful monitoring and anticipation of production capabilities and producer needs.

What makes the market particularly odd is that the game buys excess supply at the end of the round. In fact this 'export' market is the only way to increase the value of a company. But not all supply gets soaked up by foreign demand. For each sale to the foreign market, the demand goes down; in any given round where supplied goods are priced above the downward sliding demand, the trade doesn't get done.

One play is certainly not enough to have a meaningful opinion for this one, but it is enough to know that the mechanism mashup makes for an interesting and unique gaming experience. The question will come down to whether it is worth the four hour play time and clunky turn cycle.

Falls out fairly simply.  A player either pulls off a sufficiently large scam, or they successfully prevent all other players from pulling off a sufficiently large scam and they then run the most effective engine.  Scams are far more viable (and easier) to execute than efficient engines. Neither is actually interesting.   This in turn is tied to a heavily strictured and constrained financial system that so limits what operations may be performed as reduce the game down two two questions, the first asked (variously) somewhere in the first 1.5 turns and the second asked at roughly the three quarter point.

There is a lot going on with this one, but it never really feels clunky or overwhelming. I really enjoy how all the separate elements flow together and make sense as opposed to feeling like a bunch of random things throw together to make a 'game.'

I can sum this game up neatly by saying that anyone who liked Container will likely also enjoy this title, but that anyone who disliked Container will also be repelled by this. Both games feature player dictated economies where actual money is very tight for most of the way.

MoE has a very basic game engine, with most of the game's complexity coming about due to player interactions. The companies that players start out controlling each have stocks, and can produce a number of resources that can be used to make more buildings, power factories, or explicitly to be sold. The centre of the action is the market board, where players place markers to indicate what they want to sell and buy in order. The trick is that players early in the order have to predict what their opponents are going to do when they place the markers because players buy from each other first, and then, any left-over goods for sale are sold to the game. The money is often the same for both sales, but sales to the game generate value for the company's stock which is the main way to win the game. The catch is that sales to the game can result in some of the cubes that were priced too high not being sold at all. This is somewhat difficult to explain without having the board to demonstrate, but basically, you can always sell cubes safely at one, middle of the road price, but the higher prices are risky, as unexpectedly having too many goods sold to the game can result in them not being sold at all.

The money that comes in is then re-invested in more factories, but it can also be used to buy stocks in other companies (similar to Imperial, but more constrained due to the tightness of the money, it is much harder for stuff to change hands), and as this is a stock game, it is possible for players to lose control of their starting companies.

I tend to admire austere designs like this more than enjoy them. I didn't care for Container, and though I think this game is a step in the right direction, I still think that players are nickel and diming too much, and that there needs to be a broader, deeper economy for me to really find it interesting. The individual factory types all produce pairs of resource cubes, and it seems too easy for companies to make many of the materials that they need, making it less lucrative to truly specialize early. As I said with Container, repeat play with the right group could make for a very solid experience, but there doesn't seem to be enough here to convince me that spending that kind of time is worth it for me.

An interesting economic game - mostly the game centers around money management, rather than stock speculation or board tactics like Imperial. Everyone manages a company, producing up to 6 different resources for sale (to raise share value) or to funnel back into the production cycle. Figuring out the trade mechanics and the way to maximize your points practically forces repeat plays. This a tight, highly competitive economic game that can play in about 3 hours.

I think this is going to take a series of plays to articulate why my opinion is positive. I love the presentation and packaging. I'll post more substance when my head stops buzzing.

I've recovered, I was entirely off-base, this game falls apart in the stock ownership part of the game. So many more interesting games.

Various feelings on this game...
Market and resource management are a solid 10; almost perfect, I'd love to implement it in other games.
shares system is a 7; a bit too messy for my guts, I'd prefer not to have the companies buying other companies' shares.
general management of the game is 5; realy boring and messy, please invent something simpler!!!

Juego económico puro y duro. Con un grupo de compañías que hay que desarrollar comprando fabricas. Me llama la atención el sistema de mercado, compra/venta. Con venta/compra de acciones. Reparto de beneficios y toma de decisiones que hacen que las acciones suban/bajen

Interesante

The economic system is totally ridiculous, and this can't be called a simulation even with the best of intentions. It's also clearly broken in many ways.

As an example, the flows of money involved with buying shares make no sense Something you will probably see is: Company X buy shares of company Y from the pool, threatening a takeover of Y by CEO of X, money goes to the bank. CEO of Y is either going to be basically out of the game by losing control of the company, or he must have the company buy back some of the shares held by X or the CEO of X. Money for these shares (+ a little extra) goes to the previous owner of the shares, and the shares return back to the pool. So suddenly a huge pile of money just disappeared from the coffers of company Y, while no other state changed. 

It remains to be seen whether the all the interlocking broken systems lead to interesting or degenerate play. I rather liked my one play of this, but can see it going either way on further plays.

I really like the different layers in this game. It is in most cases important to run an efficient company but there is also a meta game where you buy and sell other corporations stocks. The trade phase is excellent with great opportunities regardless of turn order. All in all a great game that will hit the game table often.

Promising design. The demand/supply mechanism seems interesting, [-]the rest is a solid economic game[/-]. Need to play to see how it works.

Edited after some plays: I still think the demand/supply is an interesting mechanism, but share buying/selling/redeeming mechanism is too weird for my taste.

played only a 2-player game. deep and heavy euro-economic. could rise above or fall on 3 or 4 player game. somehow the game instructions are sometimes confusing and could be clear. for now it seems an underrated game and some controversy around the designer should not matter when grading it, its about the game not the person who created.
definitively not an easy challenge.

I was fortunate to have an opportunity to play Master of Economy. The game was released in 2010 and is very difficult to find in the US. Well, what an incredible "perfect information" strategy game. This game has everything you would expect in an economic game and the mechanics are very tightly integrated, creating a very intuitive gameplay experience. 

Players are running companies, building factories that produce materials that are needed to fuel/supply other factories. These materials can be bought and sold in the free market and are priced based on a unique import/export supply and demand mechanic. The stock price of a company will rise has companies become more well known via successful exporting of goods.

Players can invest both personally or with their company's money in the stock of other companies. There are shareholder meeting where companies can be over-taken by other players, which adds a great diplomacy element to the game. Company leaders can offer dividends to keep shareholding happy or may choose to embezzle money from their company to be placed in their personal investment account. The winner is the player that has invested his/her personal money the wisest (most money).

This was by far the best gaming experience I have had in awhile. Perhaps because I just didn't expect it to be so good given the lack of hype of this game.

While the economic system was not perfectly realistic within Master of Economy (which is not a prerequisite for my group), we all thought that within the interwoven mechanic of the system, there was enough flexibility to control and manipulate one's objectives to accomplish a strategic goal and encourage fun interactive gameplay.

With that said, we didn't like that in order to drive up company stock price, ALL a player needed to do was export a lot of materials. This was much easier to accomplish as a player high on the turn order track. While the last corporation in turn order may have an advantage of knowing exactly how the market will "play out", they still need to have the "right set" of available resources to sell. I have been last in turn order, wanting to sell a set of a certain type of resource that my opponent flooded the export market with ... making my resources (on the last turn no less) useless. Being first in turn order allows you to place in the "conservatively priced" export positions that may not be available for players later in turn order.

We didn't like that as company President, there was no way to "tank" company stock value if you wanted to. The only way to defend company takeover was to buy back shares of stock. 

I personally did not like that at end of game, a company's stock holdings in other companies was only valued in terms of stock price and not the capital assets remaining in the invested company. I debated this with my group after the game ended. Specifically, I believed intuitively that owned stock share value, based on the distribution of remaining capital assets of each company should have factored in ALL outstanding shares in each company, not just those reflected in player's personally owned share holdings. 

While something just didn't feel right with the economic system, we all valued the gameplay experience, recognized some of the uncovered limitations and acknowledged them as just part of the playing field which we were all competing on. Perhaps this will change with future plays...

No wow feeling about this one: a lot of (little) rules/ phases (where are those player aids when you need them?) and a long gaming time; Nothing new that I haven't seen before in an economic game before;

If we played correct there is something broken also in the game: if a player/company can put down all of his markers at once during the trade phase, turn order is very important, and you almost have no ways to change that (1 lousy telephone/turn).

[thing=75441][/thing] is a fairly heavy economic game. Players start as CEOs of a company and begin ramping up resource [b]production[/b] reminiscent of [thing=26990][/thing]. However, goods can not only be sold to the other players but also back to the game (export). The [b]market[/b] mechanism is quite charming with the potential for players to purchase resources from others at a lower price and 'export' the same at a higher price. This is not without its risks as the higher priced exports may lose their demand and not sell. Finally, players and even companies buy and sell [b]shares[/b] of the companies and vote for new CEOs. Companies can pay dividends and CEOs can even embezzle funds out of their companies and into their own pockets.

This is an interesting but strange game as some features seem counter-intuitive, ie. the only way to raise capital is through selling of resources. Buying and selling shares can never increase company coffers or affect share value.

--Jan2011-- Quite a ferociously anti-intuitive title.  I'm afraid I can't claim any competence at this one, but I was compelled to buy a copy!  It's totally fascinating - though trying to evaluate the worth of a particular share at any point in time is quite astonishingly difficult.  Precisely what manner of play is effective is equally difficult to discern:  is there a viable operate-good-companies-well path that leads to victory?  Or can one only win by operating one's initial company particularly rapaciously?  Only time (and additional plays!) will tell.

A fun economical game where buying stocks in other companies is a fun mechanic. You can either build up your own company, or you could slaughter it in order to buy shares in a better company. Several ways to play this game, it looks balanced.
Few turns means it is not a forgiving game, one bad move might swing the game totally. 
Overall a nice game.

Putrid.  3 hours I will never get back.

An "economic" game where the object is to produce goods that nobody wants.  Additionally, you can destroy another player's chances of winning by buying lots of stock in his company.  Finally, huge turn order advantages.

Mix in bad rules and you get . . . putrid.

(I did play it.  Almost threw the board across the BGG.Con main hall, but I did finish it)

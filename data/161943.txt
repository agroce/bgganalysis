I thought Koryo was an OK game.  Choson is basically the same game, with complications added by events.  There is a fair degree of chaos, but each round presents decisions about consolidating majorities, seeking to grab new ones, or triggering an event and adding only one character to your tableau.  Quick and fun with a few things to think about.

Production quality of the cards is good.  Some player aids would have been really useful - I have downloaded Lines Hitter's from the files section, which crams an extraordinary amount of information into a tiny space.The artwork isn't quite as striking as Koryo's.  The rules are too brief, as all the questions in the rules forum testify.

Small card game with relatively intense strategy. Doesn't take long to play, but oh man it can be thinky. Kind of like a heavier and more demanding Love Letter.

RATING: 8.2
The perfect evolution of Koryo. Choson is more complex and gives you more possibilities to suddenly turn the table.

If you enjoy minimalist games from Asia like Love Letter, Lost Legacy, Koryo, etc, you WILL like Choson.

I really like this game. It's quick and there's a ton of player interaction. I think it's really interesting and fun.

Unfortunately, it has a high learning curve for such a short game, and I don't know if I'll be able to get it to the table with one of my groups again. It really needs a player aid (I started one before I introduced it to my group, but I never finished it; hopefully someone more talented than I has made one now). If we played more often, then it would work, but every time we try, it's like we're learning it for the first time again.

Also, it seemed a bit unbalanced with three people, because two tended to gang up on the third, but maybe that's just the dynamic in the group I played with. I don't know how well it would work with just two players, but I have high hopes for four. Not that I'll ever have three other people willing to try it.

RATING: 6
Similar to Koryo but with more interesting gameplay.  The interaction of the "comes into play" powers with holding majorities is interesting and can result in some clever plays.  I like it better than Koryo, but it still isn't one of my top choices for a filler game.

RATING: N/A
Pros: Gorgeous art. Interesting majority battles/powers, especially due to the constrained # of tableau cards kept round-to-round.

Cons: No hand retention means purely probabilistic planning and a lot of luck. Reshuffling and redealing each round means the game takes nearly twice as long.

(Being able to hold onto cards in hand looks like it'd warp some of the game dynamics in pretty fundamental ways, though, by letting you deliberately keep cards out of circulation.)

Better than Koryo, but there are rules ambiguities. In the end, I'm getting rid of it in favour of Lords of Scotland. LoS may be longer, but I feel it's worth the extra time due to the fact that it doesn't suffer from rules ambiguities, or less choices as the game progresses.

RATING: 4
Scoring cards in a game based on their frequency is nothing new (one "1"' two "2's" three "3's" etc.), nor is variable card powers, and putting both together is a great idea; however, the delivery system in this game failed me. It was far too wonky were card powers changed seemingly for no reason based on how they were played. Also, ditching your hand each round took away the ability to work towards something, creating a senseless luck of the draw.

I suppose once you master the learning curve the game would be OK, I just didn't feel another play of it was warented for me.

RATING: 7.5
Seemed cleaner than Koryo, but it's been a while since I've played Koryo.

update: This game is pretty good. Has some interesting decisions. Takes a bit to learn how all the cards work, but there seem to be quite a few different strategies that are viable.

RATING: 7
I totally love playing this game. It uses a pairs deck (quantity of card = value on card)and has great mechanisms. It's just a fun experience. Don't expect great balance though, unless there's something I'm missing anything can happen in the last round and totally change the whole game!

Sequel to Koryo. It allows more options than its predecessor. The rules are more complicated, but not too overwhelming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The sequal to Koryo, which I like a lot, and it's very similar to that. The main difference is that each of the numbered cards can now also be used as an event, if you have an event card to combine it with (the event cards are all identical and don't have their own power). Most of these events are attacking other players, so the game is more interactive that way. Overall I'd say it's a somewhat improved version of Koryo. Sadly, this game is also lacking player aids, which was a terrible ommission from Koryo and even harder to understand here because now each numbered card has two powers (one for majority, one when combined with an event card). Expect to spend a lot of time passing around the little rulebook until someone makes a good player aid.

Enjoyable game, the sequel to Koryo with which it shares many similarities. Majorities in numbers and the numbers have special abilities that you can use when you have the majority at the end of your turn. I enjoyed it, although there is quite a bit of luck involved too. Not sure if it really is an improvement of Koryo.

Like King of New York is the better version of King of Tokyo, this feels like the better version of Koryo, as it has more bells attatched to it. I wished designers would make 'the best'-version right from the start :s

The only thing this game needs is 4 overview-cards which is handy when you play the game for the first time.

A really rough ruleset that is hard to teach to first-timer with lots to remember.

Choson is a mishmash of different little idea (set collecting, majority, variable power, card play, etc.) that forms a coherent game. I'm just not very compelled to play again considering what is available on the market.

RATING: 7.4
This feels more complicated and involved than I recall Koryo being, but I still enjoyed it. What it does need though is for all players to understand what they're doing and what their cards do.

The iconography is decent, but has that annoying tendency of only making sense once you know the game and so don't really need it...

The decision space of trying to score easy sets which don't score many points, or harder sets which score lots but can more easily be attacked or overtaken is enjoyable as is the choice between playing sets of characters (for majorities), a mix of character and event cards (for activation abilities) or event cards (possibly for a lot of points).

After 3 Games (2x4players and 1x3players), i have a very good impression. I've put 8, but it's probably gonna go up, just waiting to play more games. Rules are easy to catch (after 10 minutes explanations and 1 games with probably a few minor mistakes, everybody had it clear).

It's a cheap and small game with a good amount of complexity and tactic. Worth your $ ;-)

Essentially the same game as Koryo, but with some mechanical changes that shake things up. There are now generalized Event cards that can trigger the Event icon on the regular cards (rather than having separate event cards worth negative points). And special power tokens allow for more fluid shaking up of other player's tableaus.

This is probably better than Koryo, but it's much higher on the icnongraphy despite having more streamlined gameplay. Hard to make a choice between them.

I was torn in the rating for this one.

The rulebook is nothing short of awful, and I probably would have given up if I wasn't reviewing the game. 

But I was, so I kept going. And I found a really fun, creative game. It would be so much better if there were words on the cards.

I like how your choices narrow as the game progresses. The powers on the cards are balanced with the number of them in the deck.

This is intriguing and there is a surprising number of paths to victory for such a small card game.

Full disclosure: I got a review copy of this from the company.

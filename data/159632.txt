Try this experiment: shuffle your deck of champion cards and play them randomly.  You probably won't win, but you will annoy your opponent and you may be surprised by how close the game is.  

I think there are several reasons for this.  The obvious one is that the two players hold exactly the same cards.  Added to that, the cards are well balanced; there are usually several good cards to play to a location and there are never any certain winners.  Add to that the combined effects of four different special powers in deciding the result of each combat.  You know what three of those powers are, but the fourth (on the card your opponent will play to this combat) can make a dramatic difference and is not predictable until the very end of each round.  This creates a degree of chaos that renders calculation beyond "my cards may give me a decent total strength" redundant.  So, to summarise, I believe I have found that the margin for skilful play in Strife is small.  That's a shame because there are a couple of nice ideas in this design - the tie losing dice that also grants vps and the last card you played having an enduring effect.

Production quality of the cards is reasonable and the artwork is very nice. The rules are clear enough, but it strikes me that they don't cover all situations that may arise.

Really neat little card game with great artwork, it plays a little like Omen: Reign of War, but has a tighter design. You set up Champions to face off against one another in different locations, and then shift them over to a Legacy pile, sort of emulating a passage of time. The cards will have Legacy and Battle abilities that are resolved in different phases, but the sweet spot is that there is a d10 'Fatestone' which you pass off as a tie breaker, but also advances a tick each time, so it's sort of an added layer of strategy, who will get those extra victory points? Cool, portable, easy to teach.

After the first round we tried that one player select the heroes randomly and the other not. The random player won with a big diference. That shows that card powers are stupid and that Strife it's a game that seems to have strategy but it really doesn't.

I backed the Kickstarter for this game and was happy to see all those stretch goals met.  The artwork is beautiful, and the tin box and "fatestone" (a d12) are of fine quality.  The cards themselves are slightly thinner than I had expected, but I was planning to sleeve this set, so it was not an issue for me.  The gameplay is smooth and fun.

Don't be fooled by short playing time and relatively low table footprint, this game is far frome being a filler. Surprisingly complex gameplay with simple rules.

Recommended as an interesting alternative to the typical gateway games (meatier but not overwhelming). Also an excellent choice for the single game you take with you on your vacations (it's tightly packaged in a small tin box).

If you like the game, consider also Vampire Empire - very different mechanics and style, but very similar format.

So tense,full of decisions,gains value from the experience of your opponent.The fact that you have access to all your cards from the beggining of the game adds a lot of analysis paralysis to the mix.

[b]My thoughts on Strife: Legacy of the Eternals[/b]
A perfect information strategy card game with cool mechanics and great artwork. Each player has 10 identical heroes in hand, each with a battlefield ability (which activates when played onto the battlefield area) and a legacy ability (which activates when the hero is on top op of the discard pile). These abilities can combo off each other, allowing a lot of tense moments of deep strategic thinking (and AP). Both players simultaneously select a hero from their hand and play them on the battlefield. After the cards have been played, the battles seem a bit anticlimactic, as it is just a matter of determining player order and executing the abilities on the heroes on the battlefield and in the discard pile. Also, during the course of the game, your cards get played and your options reduce. So choices in the beginning of the game greatly influence your options in the late game. I appreciate the design, but I don't really enjoy the game. This game is probably best when both players are really experienced with the game.

This game has such a simple concept, but it has an amazing depth of strategy. I'm still learning the best strategies, but even new players can keep me on my toes.

Drawbacks: only a two player game so I can't play it as often as I'd like. It's hard to introduce to new players because good play requires a good understanding of the cards.

Interestingly, I've found that my brother and I often select the same cards. I'd love to learn more psychology to explain that.

Demoed and bought at GenCon 2014. 

Great game with a lot of tough choices and deep thought. The art is also great.

The game has some minor intricacies between character abilities that the rules don't clarify and it isn't clear how things are supposed to interact. I suspect this will be tidied up for the actual release and/or kickstarter. Clarifying these issues can easily push the game to a 9.

Overall, one of the great unexpected finds for GenCon 2014. Looking forward to the kickstarter.


Edit - 20140914 - I reached out to the developers about the rule issues I had encountered. They had already cleared up many of these and released a new PnP version. The game runs much smoother now.

Pushed the score up to 9.

Interesting two player duel of creating card combos each turn between characters played as "champions" and the "legacy" character card atop one's discard pile. Each player uses a similar hand of 10 cards, played one at a time in whatever order they wish over three rounds, to battle over locations worth between 1-4 points. A surprising amount of variety results from the interaction of just these ten characters, each one worth between 1 to 10 strength and having a unique ability to alter conditions in the head to head battles.

The artwork on the oversized cards is gorgeous and helps to draw one into the game's theme. The inclusion of a d12 fate die is the most elegant solution to breaking ties I've seen in a game: the player in possession of the fate die may break a tie in their favor by passing it to their opponent who then increases its value by 1, and at the end of the game the player still in possession of the fate die adds that many points to their overall score.

Imagine if R took forty-five minutes instead of forty-five seconds, and featured cards who have abilities that only trigger when they're on the top of the discard. Locations with varying VP values and game modifying abilities (in the base game, this consists solely of modifying the number value of different played cards), and events that can change how VP are earned or turns are won. After three rounds whoever has the most VP wins, and the cards used for tracking VP can go up to 69, which is very curious because it's a 2-player only game and even with me playing pretty toughly I only had 32 points. It's got the right layering of interactions where I can track what I need to do with the cards in my hand, but requires a smidge more because of the cards potentially in your opponents hand, and their interactions with the legacy cards. This game did everything for me that R did, but with so much more game.

I'm really enjoying Strife, and I'm very glad I backed it.
The level of polish on display here in terms of both production and design is simply masterful.

To the uninitiated, Strife can seem daunting.  
Each round, players simultaneously play a single card, who's effects chain with the effects of the card played in the previous round.
The core of the game is in finding clever combinations of cards, and understanding what sequence to play them in. 
This is a wonderful little puzzle, but does require that players read and understand the mechanics of every single card in their 10 card hand.

That said, it's not as terribly complicated as it seems at first, and after a few rounds you'll get a good feeling some of the stronger card combinations and tricks.
This is where the game is at it's strongest, as players begin the mindgame of predicting each-other's movements.

Awesome artwork.  The playmat is really nice.  A wide variety of choices and possibilities each turn.  Playing the same deck of cards blind against your opponents and seeing what they've played over time leads to interesting deductions but still leaves an element of chance/risk that I like.  The powers of the various character combo really well in some very cool ways.  The manual is not entirely clear on some of them but BGG has clear info on all the ones I was confused about.

RATING: 4
Tremendous disappointment. Advanced version of R/BraveRats: each player has a set of 10 cards, and each turn will play one face down. When revealed, the highest (subject to various modifiers) wins that confrontation. As in R, each card has a special battle ability that may affect the outcome; an extra complication here is that the card played the previous round also triggers its "legacy ability". Locations and random event cards provide additional modifiers.

It's got lovely art, and the fatestone tie-breaking mechanism is a stroke of genius. I thought it was worth trying because I'm a big fan of R, but the charm of that game is that it's relatively simple to narrow your opponent's choice down to a few options -- the game is in the bluff and doublethink that ensues. Strife is much too much: too much to remember, too much to calculate, too much time.

It's possible that it will reward extended play, i.e. perhaps memorizing all of the card powers will improve play. It's not going to get that here.

RATING: 7.65
The premise of Strife is a very simple one: play a card from your hand, resolve some abilities, score victory points. What's more, there are only 10 "Champions" in the game!  

However, on top of this straightforward foundation, designer Christopher Hamm has built an incredibly strategic game of card combos and head games with much more depth than its small package suggests. With that said, the game's greatest strength (its strategic depth and complexity) is also its weakness in that the game requires a certain level of buy-in. 

While the initial learning curve here is a bit high, if you're interested in this style of game and have a semi-regular gaming buddy who also digs these sorts of games, I think you'll find a lot to enjoy in Strife and something a bit different than a lot of other H2H battling card games on the market.

Awesome art is just the extremely pleasant addition to what's already a great game.

Beautiful art but the game demands analysis paralysis until players know the cards really well (and even then it is  a real possibility).

Definitely not my kind of game. Too many texts to read and remember: you start your first game and you need to spend 10 minutes just reading cards, when you reach the last one you forgot (if you are anything like me) the first five.
During the game 8 of these texts on 4 cards need to be read again.... i ended up basically playing randomly.
Probably after a dozen games, when you know by heart all the powers, you start enjoying the game... but i dont feel the need to play a second game.
The art is gorgeous and the cards are of the very good quality.
The priority mechanism with the dice is quite nice and the idea of the "legacy" isn't bad at all... after all the game just works but it's an exercise in reading powers and this devoids it of fun, i am sorry.

An excellent two-person card duel, with lots of really neat interactions between the different cards.  I like the mind games that come into play when you face off against the other person, and the interactions of the current card and the legacy card are great.

I liked this game a lot. Very tactical and interesting at all time. I like the choices you have as the player. Only minus is the lands you battle for have somehow boring abilities, or at least repetitive.

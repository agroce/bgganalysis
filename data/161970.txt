RATING: N/A
Rating based on one partial play of two hours after a one hour rules explanation, after watching a few videos.

Wow. This is heavy. Heavy to learn. Heavy to play. Heavy to work out if there is a strategy. Heavy to have the time to finish a game.

I think a couple of my game group thought it was too much like work.

I'd like to give it another go, but I think it might be too much for some of the group and maybe for me.

I demoed this one night as we went through the rules, and was kind of "meh" on it after a lot of initial excitement. But my wife was really excited to play it. I have to say that the Rahdo walkthrough videos are a godsend! I read through the rules again by myself and watched his videos, and was able to easily teach the game by ourselves. It is a great game, though a little cut-throat with only 2 players. We may have to house rule a few things to allow us to live in the same house afterwards.

most innovative game I've ever tried. best game in my collection so far. I have tried it with both 2 and 3 players and I liked it with both counts i prefer it better with two. deduction mixed with worker placement. very very nice

RATING: 9.5
Gave a 9 after the first play. I want to give it 10 but while it's been a blast so far I'm not 100% convinced it's an evergreen.

I did wonder whether the deduction side would become a routine exercise after several plays and become less engaging, and not everyone will enjoy the possibility of your whole game tumbling down if you mess it up, but for me these two things counteract each other. I just find it ridiculously fun and exciting. And once people start publishing... for a thinky Euro this game has drawn the most trash talk out of our group outside of The Resistance. But of a different flavour. "That can't be right! Someone debunk this garbage!" "Oh, but it is right. I think it is YOU who should check your working..." (aside: this is mostly my fault because in the first game I thought it'd be a good idea to rush grants with dodgy research, not realising how the end-game scoring worked...) 

edit: 10+ plays in and still love it, I think it's earned its 10

Spillede Alchemists for 2. gang i fredags. Har kun spillet det med min kone, men jeg må indrømme at jeg heller ikke er super interesseret i at spille det med flere. Det er et eurospil, med en god omgang deduktion smidt ind i spillet. Og så er det nødvendigt med noget elektronik (vi bruger vores iphones, 1 til hver, det fungerer rigtigt fint).

Man bruger sine cubes/workers til at købe ingredienser, opgraderings/bonus kort, brygge potions, sælge potions og lave "afhandlinger". Deduktionen kommer ind når du har de forskellige ingredienser, og du så skal regne ud hvilke egenskaber de har. Det er rimelig kløgtigt, men det gør også at der skal tænkes utroligt meget. Vores 2 personers spil har taget omkring 2 timer, men vi tager det så også meget afslappet. Jeg kunne bare forestille mig at med de folk vi normalt spiller med, så vil et 4 personers spil nok tage det dobbelte, og det tror jeg ikke spillet kan bære. 

7/10

Juego de fusión de tablero con app móvil. Original en ese aspecto, no sé cómo no han salido más juegos así al respecto (esperando el Épica de Fenolín junto a la tablet :) )

El juego es de deducción, probando combinaciones de 2 ingredientes para ir eliminando los resultados erróneos. Detective alquímico xD. Y también de adelantarte a los planes de los contrarios, o fastidiarles demostrando sus errores en sus publicaciones XD

Con la mezcla de 2 ingredientes, creas pociones, que las puedes vender a aventureros, dárselas a probar a tus becarios xD, o bebértelas tú mismo para ver cuales son sus efectos, y con todo ello ir publicando teorías sobre los ingredientes o refutar las teorías de otros, para ganar como alquimista reputación o hacérsela perder a otro xD. También puedes comprar objetos mágicos que darán ventajas y/o puntos de victoria que junto a la reputación, las teorías correctas y las becas que hubieras conseguido, determinarán el ganador. De 2 a 4 jugadores, funciona perfecto, si bien con más jugadores hay mas piques :)

Discovered this game while in PhD thesis, loved the theme *(alchemy with a focus on experiment and peer reviews !) 
The app integration is well done, but the game in itself is not for everyone - you basically solve your own puzzle, with little interaction with the other players except in a worker placement way of "I am here so you can't be here too".

+ The deduction element in this game is unlike anything else that I have in my collection; The components are theme-rich and help to draw you into the game you're playing.
- For what it is, this game feels like it goes long each time; If there was a way to shorten it up by 20-30 minutes, it would be a huge hit.

Finally got this one to the table. Really interesting deduction game. I definitely need a couple more plays (and a better read through of the rules) for things to fall into place. First impressions: I like it and can see it growing on me.

Second game (upgraded to a 8 from 7.5): oops - I managed to flip a sign when putting it into the board which screwed up my deductions :P Was still a ton of fun and plays really quickly. I like the app integration with this one. It works really well.

Note: Have yet to try the master variant. Also, we've been playing 2 player. Will attempt to introduce to friends this weekend.

1st play: Brain-burning deduction game that played very slowly on the first run through. Needs to be played again soon so that I can figure out if it's a keeper, because it needs to be a little shorter, and I'm not sure if the artifacts will vary the game up enough between plays to make it replay-able. Really high barrier of entry makes me reluctant to teach it to new players.

2nd play: I really enjoyed the second play through, even more than the first. Teaching it was easier this time and we were able to explore the game more. The actions flow together well and the theme blends with the mechanics smoothly.

Mind blowing.  Incredibly steep learning curve, requires heavy deduction (some people will not be able to handle it!)  Artwork is fantastic.  Player screens are the most amazing player screens ever.  

The game does an amazing job of capturing the theme.


It should be stressed that the learning curve is very harsh, and your first game is very much just a learning experience, and you need to give a thorough tutorial on how the alchemy laws work before playing.

Would be higher, but there is something I really dislike about how selling potions works. Getting beat out and not being able to sell a potion when you want to feels bad to me and this seems to happen a lot in two player games.

The game is also quite the heavy game.  It is basically two entirely different games to teach.  The deduction portion of the game can take a lot to teach for people not used to deduction games, and then the worker placement part of the game is quite involved as well, and does not follow standard worker placement 'norms' for how they resolve and where the 'workers' go.  Oh, then the publishing and debunking which almost feels like a THIRD game to teach.

Once the rules are done and around turn 3 or 4 when everyone understands what is going on, the it is GREAT FUN!  Game 2 with new players is WONDERFUL, but getting through game 1 is a huge hurdle, especially as our gaming nights usually involve alcohol, heh.

Juego muy temático para ser un euro y muy intuitivo a pesar de que aparente farragoso. Un diseño de sobresaliente. Mecánica principal de puntos de acción. La deducción es importante para la victoria pero quizá juegue un papel más importante aún el faroleo y la picardía del jugador a la hora de publicar/refutar teorías. La única pega quizá la poca variedad de cartas que vienen en el juego.

It is quite common for cooperatives titles to offer systemic difficulty for the players to grapple with. After all, game systems are the only divide a player normally has from success. However, it is the rare competitive game that taxes players with a similar sense of difficulty, and for this Alchemists stands almost unique in my collection (Trajan and Macao are two others which spring to mind).

The balance between mastering the systems, and besting your competitors is perfectly honed in Alchemists. The cheeky humor, tight action selection options, and persistent desire to do more than you can manage makes this a stellar example of 21st century game design.

Provisional 8 after one play. There is a lot going on here, and while picking up a new game usually comes very easy to me, I know this one needs additional plays before I can really give a fair review. I won with like 39 points (39-38-36 final score in a 3 way game) and we all made a TON of mistakes, including forgetting to score the high number of seals a couple of end rounds, and lots of just suboptimal plays. That being said, I really can't wait to play it again and I'm glad it's on the 10x10.

later: multiple plays, still quite good. Early publishing is important but risky. I've lost games from an incorrect hedging. I need to play more often to see if a metagame evolves.

I love this game because it's a great and unique mix of worker placement, resource management, and deduction. The use of the smartphone app to run the game is fun, and not seen in many other games. I've never seen any other game like it, and the potion mixing and deduction mechanics make it really special. The potion academia theme also tickles my fancy too. There's a higher-than-average learning curve to figuring out how the deduction works, but when you get it, the game is truly brilliant.

Nice deduction game using a worker placement mechanism with variable player order. Players gather ingredients and mix them in potions using the game application. They can sell potions to various adventurers and use the money to buy artifacts with special abilities. The goal is to deduct the elements of each ingredient and publish your theories. The artwork is great and helps you get into the theme.

I really admire many things about this game: the depth of the deduction challenge, the excellent art, the elaborate cardboard components, and the evident dedication to implementing a very strong and creative game design concept which, in this case, includes interfacing with an App.  

However, playing the actual game was simply not that much fun, and for me on my first time game, felt more like a chore than entertaining.  Sure, I want to solve a puzzle tonight as much as the next person, but do I yearn to solve a singular puzzle sitting on my cellphone screen, or would I rather have fun playing board games tonight?

It is my sense that this game is going to fall flat with many gamers who play it for the first time.  Some, like myself, will have problems with key component readability in low light, trying to discern the difference between a plus and a minus sign within a small blue circle, etc.  Some will want to really solve everything on their turn, and run through all the permutations, and thus be gripped by times-a-wasting  AP, which will anger the other waiting players.  

Others will mistakenly place a "result circle" in the wrong place on their deduction grid and thereafter completely screw up their theories, feel like they wasted three hours due to a mere clerical error. And some first timers will simply give up trying to figure out how the combination cancellations and neutral results occur using colors, circle sizes, and plus and minus signs. Who really cares about abstract colors, circle sizes, and signs combining?!  I do?  Not really.

I do like the betting on other people's theories aspect of the game, the student experiment mechanic, and the discount bidding spot.  

I feel like I should want to play this obviously very interesting design again, but for better or worse, I actually do not want to play it again, so gonna have to give it a 6.

This game has two extremely unbalanced cards. The one where it gives you information once per round on an enemy's potion is just broken at 4 players, and extremely strong at 3. At two players it may be ok. The other gross one is the one that allows you to keep one ingredient instead of discarding both.

To give you an idea of how broken they are, in a 4 player game just having one of those meant having full information of every ingredient by the end of the game, while i had information on about 2-3 out of 8 ingredients. And every play I made was on getting information about ingredients for the whole game. Having that item means having at least 250% information compared to another player.

The explanation takes too long and the game could have been made simpler. Ingredients should have been free for instance. Otherwise, to fix the game as it is, just remove said cards or increase their cost to at least 5.

RATING: 7
I was a bit disappointed with this one after my first play. I didn't like the king making aspect of the "sell a potion" action when you choose which potion to sell. Secondly, I also didn't like the level of randomness that comes from: 1) the artifact cards 2) the degree of luck in the potion making. In my first game I managed out of pure luck to gain knowledge of two theories that could be debunked on the following turn. That won me the game, but felt anticlimactic.

I liked the the czech games edition humor that is also prevalent in this game. The worker placement aspect of the game is decent.

This game is a jewel and one of my favourite. It's challenging, its clever and probably the most thematic game I have ever played. The integration with the app is outstanding and actually fun. I adore it. The only real downside is that takes at least one or two games to really understand how it works. There is a lot of risk taking, bluffing and lying involved in the game. I have also the impression that some special items may be too strong. But it doesn't matter, the whole experience is brilliant. Downtime is not really a problem as, during other's people action you can scribble your notes and mumble like a proper alchemist! Brilliant!

Very fun game. The companion app works great. Wouldn't play the game without the app. This is definitely a brain burning deduction game with worker placement. If you screw up on identifying the different potions it can be really hard to recover. This can result in some AP. This game will really give your brain a workout so plan on playing something lighter after playing this one. PROS: app, deduction aspect, worker placement choices. CONS: hard to recover if you make the wrong deductions.

A clever game of mixing potions, deducing the alchemical properties of the ingredients, selling said potions to adventurers, publishing your theories, and then scoring at conferences and a final round exhibition. The mechanisms for player order and placing action cubes are nifty, and the app works rather well for the potions once you wrap your head around the idea. Excellent, colorful artwork, good components (including elaborate player screens with their own deduction boards), and the rules have a little of that CGE sense of humor you'll recall from Dungeon Petz, etc. I do feel the game is already substantial enough without the Master Variant for debunking theories, but otherwise it's pretty damn good and the variation of ingredient properties with the app gives it hefty replay value.

What a depressing experience. 

On the good side: the theme is very interesting and funny, the mechanics and fluff go welltogether. Also, at first sight, the illustrations are quite nice. The app works as intended, with a little fiddling even in low light.

But on the bad side, where do I start? It's basically some kind of single-player deduction game with a tacked on board game to force player interaction limited to "I want to do the same thing you do but I cannot", a ton of unintuitive rules, way too many components. It is a big mess. Feels as if there was the App and then they built a game around it and did not care about making it even slightly elegant.

It takes ages to explain, but there is not a lot of complexity, mostly it's just complicated. :(

Easily the most overhyped game of 2014.

With 4 it is gift from heaven. Clever, unigue Nd compelling gameplay. It haves enormous depth and at the same time guge amount of humor. But with two player the spots are to tight. It’s possible to have turns where you litteraly can’t do anything. Just watch your opponent play. Play it with 3 or 4.

RATING: 4.8
Initial rating, based on playing once. I'd rate the game experience by itself one point higher than my rating here; that point difference is for the app-requirement.

The game is gorgeously put together, with a lot of love and attention to detail. Sadly the game experience flows haltingly, slowing down to all the deduction and choices depending on the choices of the previous player, so you can't plan far ahead. Also, the app works pretty badly when the lighting isn't optimal, taking forever to recognize the cards (we switched to manual input after about a third of our first game), which makes things drag on ever more. Several actions in the game can be incredibly punishing when you've made a mistake, or just timed badly and are prevented by other players from taking the action you were hoping for. Also, if you're good at logic puzzles (as I am), you have an immense advantage over players who aren't. (I won 47-19-5 in my first game; that's not the type of score which makes for a fun game.)

The rulebook is "funny", but incredibly longwinded. Everything could've been explained much more succinctly, making it much easier to look up specific rules.

Reminds me in many ways of Dungeon Lords - and that isn't a positive recommendation for me.

Very original and refreshing game! Very surprised with the quality of the components, excellent! One of the best deduction games out there!
The app is really necessary in this game. This seems to have a bit of the CGE's game mechanics in here, and also artwork. The artwork is from the same guy who did "Dungeon Petz". The select player order and draw cards accordingly is very similar to "Last Will". The sell to adventurers potions is very similar to sell petz to costumers from "Dungeon Petz". Vlaada did have a participation on the game after all.
Despite complaints have not found this game to be too long, nor does it drags itself. It plays at a very good pace, the typical round goes like this: usually all players go for at least 1 ingredient card (takes 20 secs for all players), then 1 player uses the sage (takes 2 secs), then 1 or 2 players sell, (takes 5 mins max - because of dedution aspects), then the artifact buy (takes 30 secs - reading included), debunk is not often used (not on the first 3 out of 6 rounds), then 1 or 2 players publish or endorse theories (takes 1 min), then players test on student (may take 10 mins if all players go there), and lastly the drink action, just 1 person usualy goes there (takes 1 minute). So I really don't see how the game drags. This game is underrated here on the geek.

My first game took so long!
It's fun to try to deduce the materials, until someone messes their board up... Then you wait hour for them to backtrack and try to find the fault... Which then turns it into a less fun game. :)

-The actions and the wake-up method is nice.
-Board art is a bit wonky. :)
-The favor cards are not varied enough I think and most are very situational.
-I don't really understand the point of the rule that you can only place 3 workers on 1st turn.

Szerintem ez az egyik legfigyelemreméltóbb eurogém az utóbbi időben. Az már önmagában kuriózum, hogy egy telefonos alkalmazást hívunk segítségül. Féltem, hogy nem fér majd meg ilyen módon egymás mellett a technika és egy társas, de szerintem ez bőven belefér, érdekes színt ad az egésznek, egyáltalán nem zavaró. Másrészt a játék témája, mechanizmusa egyedülálló, már a szabály olvasásakor átütött az, hogy nagyon egyben van az egész. Letisztult. A végén azt írja a köszöneteknél a szerző, hogy Chvatil is ránézett, ez érződik is szerintem. Többünknek is beugrott róla a Dungeon páros. Talán a grafika hasonló, talán egy kicsit a sorrend sáv, a humoros körítőszöveg stb.
Az egzaktság, amit már írtam, azt hiszem el is várható egy ilyen témában. Egy olyan keverési mechanizmust talált ki a szerző, amiben néhány alaptételből következik minden, és az összes akciótípus ezekre a keverésekre épül. Ha két összetevőt összekeverünk, abból 7 dolog jöhet ki végeredményben: 3 jó, 3 rossz és egy semleges. Ezekből aztán rengeteg dolgot ki lehet következtetni. Végeredményben a cél minél hamarabb beazonosítani, hogy melyik összetevő melyik vegyületnek felel meg a 8-ból. Szerintem a tanonc fokozat nem lehet nagy kihívás, de a mester fokozatnál a cáfolás már nem mindig evidens. Matematikai logika órán jó szemléltető játék lenne szerintem. De nem feltétlen győz a logika, a játék sava-borsát az adja, hogy a lehető legjobb időzítéssel, esetleg némileg kockáztatva tegyük meg tétjeinket a megfelelő alkímiai elméletekre. Bízzunk a többiek tippjeiben? Vagy csak a saját következtetésünkben? Vezessük félre a többieket, bevédve magunkat (ez a bevédés a tévedés ellen zseniális szerintem)? Esetleg ők vezetnek minket félre? Nagyon sok finomság lehet a játékban, de az alapmechanizmusokra gyorsan rá lehet érezni.

Hogy rosszat is mondjak: A könyvelésre nagyon oda kell figyelni, az esetek kizárása azért nem csak annyi mint mondjuk a Cluedoban. A matekon kívül alaposság is szükséges szerintem, könnyű téveszteni, és sokat bukhatatunk rajta. Az újrajátszhatóságot nehéz felmérni, mester fokozatban szerintem benne lehet 10-20 parti, de több nem hiszem. Az eladás akció nekem túlbonyolítottnak tűnik, valahogy ezt feleslegesnek érzem, vagyis nem jöttem rá miért gyúrtak rá erre ennyire: a 4 smiley-s kártya, és a hírnév sávon a fokozatok... Kicsit túl van lihegve szerintem ez az akció.

Összességében egy nagyon jó és szép tematikus játék. Igazi jóféle, egyedi, de csak azoknak ajánlom, akik a dedukciós matekolást szeretik. Nem egy rövid játék, és nem könnyű.

Quite thinky, ends a tad faster that I probably would want, leaving you with a feel of not having done all you could. Simulates a funny academic world quite well and with a very humorous manual, speaks volumes to those closer to the research sector. Paying extreme (and i mean EXTREME) attention to the colours at all times is of the outmost importance, otherwise one mistake might easily ruin your whole game experience (and it is not a very fast game so..). Components are nice and the app is working, although having more than one smartphone/ipad is recommended since the app is used frequently, which renders passing just one device around the table a bit   unwieldy.

RATING: 5
This was taught to me with the caveat: "This is a worker placement game with a deduction element."  That's exactly right, but the truth is you can know NOTHING and still win this game.  It's WAY too much work (brain burning) for my taste.  The pressure of 6 rounds and "publishing for points" is very smart design, but (for me) not enjoyable to play...nullifying the value of deciphering the ingredients/potions makes it a card-drawing luck fest.  And it takes longer to learn than it does to play, which is annoying, IMO; you're learning a bunch of stuff that doesn't help you win.

People can have different opinions about the guys at CGE, but nobody can state they don't think outside the box!

Alchemists is set in the same funny and clever world of Dungeon Petz and Dungeon Lords, a world that seem imagined by the genius of Terry Pratchett. The rulebook explains a quite heavy game with the usual humour and covers rules in such a way to let players have no doubts: there are many details, but everything makes (in a weird nonsensical way) sense. So, remembering the details is less difficult than on would believe.

Of course the selling point of the game is the interaction between the app and the physical game. I was skeptical, but I must admit I am very impressed: the app is just a "helper", assigning an "alchemical combination" to each ingredient, and providing a smoother and faster resolution to the combination of ingredients.

The game is challenging and interesting, and very engaging like almost any other CGE published game.

A final note on the production value: it is a gorgeous looking game, with lots of detailed artwork. The box is literally full of thick cardboard, and the player screens are very cleverly designed.

One of the highlights of 2014!

Took way to long for what it is.  I especially disliked the randomness of the positive / negative results.  Sure it's more thematic, but it also feels gimicky.  Gold is tight.  If you're LUCKY, you can get a lot of it early by selling a potion to someone.  However, you need to get LUCKY in having the right card combinations to test the mix and then have the same mix to sell.  Some artifacts were stupidly overpowered, such as Periscope.

Alchemists. The game that makes grad students everywhere cringe because it's just tooooo real.

Fun game, bit of a brain burner, but I came out feeling like it was more complicated than it needed to be for its complexity.

RATING: 4
:d10-4:
UPDATE: What a rating drop! 8 after the first play, 6 after the second, and now down to 4.

There isn't enough room to deduce information from the other players, and optimal deduction strategy is contingent on good luck. The board play has a mess of problems, from redundant actions to non-interactive worker placement (a contradiction in terms?), to swingy randomness.

If this could be played in an hour, it would still be a 6. But at its current play length (~ 2 hrs.) and its underlying problems, I would reject an offer to play.

OLD COMMENT: MUCH better than expected! I'm hesitant to recommend it long-term, as there are a few niggling issues:

1. The logical deduction was pretty interesting (it felt like those intersecting row logic puzzles you can buy at the grocery store magazine rack), and I can see player reading bringing even more into the deduction once you grasp all of the mechanics going on and you begin tracking ingredients taken. HOWEVER, if the deduction becomes rote once players figure out optimal strategies, all that will matter are the other game mechanisms. This would take away one of the most fun portions of the game and contribute to the second issue. 

2. The board play is very fiddly, and there are unnecessary mechanisms (artifacts; one of the two potion tests) that could (should?) have been excised from the final version of the game. On top of this, random chance can leave you in a poor early position due to lack of gold, leading to a runaway leader scenario.

That said, the game was interesting enough that I would be happy to play it a few more times with an equally experienced group to find out. I don't think I'll be buying it to discover this for myself.

{2P: 7, 3P: 9, 4P: 8}

[i]Alchemists[/i] is one of the first "app assisted" games I have played.  I love the simple way players can coordinate the initialization of the app and then start to use it to examine outcomes.  Even better, there is actually a compelling game here beyond the app-gimmick.

On the surface, this is a very straightforward game: collect ingredients, mix them together, and try to figure out their "natures."  Now add in some tougher elements such as selling potions, publishing theories, and the last round display of your alchemical prowess.  These are all opportunities to prove you know what you're doing.  That money from selling is useful because there are money considerations including buying artifacts!  And one-time abilities called "favors."  And the competitive nature of space selection is all gated by the opening bid for player order.

In short, there's a lot here beyond just scanning cards with your phone.

When describing the game, each of those mechanics sounds like it was just bolted on.  When playing the game, they all melt together and a seamless experience emerges.  It has taken me several plays before I finally feel like the deduction algorithms "clicked" in my brain, and even still I loved playing this game. 

The only things holding me back from a higher score are the intimidation factor for new players (there's a lot to this game), and how brutal the game can be with respect to action selection.  I also suspect that the game doesn't scale down as well.  I think it may be best with 3, still great with 4, and not as good with 2.  I also fear that the app may one day be abandoned, but it's still working today after nearly 3 years.  There's also an analog capability, but then you need a moderator.  Play this one while you can!

This game really combines deduction and action selection really well together. The deduction aspect in this game is crazy heavy, there's just so many things to consider just from the apprentice variant. There's really no other game like this, an absolute bear to teach but so much fun when light bulb start clicking in everyone's heads. You can have so much fun trying to deduce that you lose track of the goal which is actually to gain points instead. 

I play board games to get away from technology, so my biggest fear was the usage of the app detracting from the experience. However, the app is essential and enhances the gameplay tremendously. This game has potential to really be one of my favs with repeated plays.

One of my best purchases of 2015 and one of the most interesting mechanics I've ever encoutnered. The mobile app works great and I must honestly say that I was terribly wrong about it before I actually played the game. It's the best thing about Aclehmists and the sole reason the replayability of the game is endless. The second best thing abotu the game is it's theme. It has one of the strongest themes I have ever seen in a game. Beside that, it's simply as very good worker placement game. Everything works fine.
It IS a hard game to play tho. It can seems scary to some people. When we play it we are able to wrap it up in around 2 hours but the fact that it's moderately hard is the reason it does not hit the table as often as it should. Probably because one simple mistake made during the game can absolutely destroy your whole gameplan. This game does not forgive. Any mistake a player will make will have brutal consequences.
Second thing I tad disliked is the potion selling. I don't really understand why we have to additionaly bid discouts when we allready chose the player order for the round.
Beside that it's great. It's also a bang for the buck. You really get your moneys worth. The game is quite cheap for the ammount of stuff that is in the box.

A deduction game with a unique and clever smart phone interface that feeds back anonymous information on card selection. The question has been raised is this all gimmick and no game, well after one play I think the use of an iphone is essential because the idea of a player sitting out to neutrally decipher the information is unacceptable. I'm sure many games will follow this idea.

 Yes the game has a high luck factor, but you must be prepared to take a lot of chances otherwise a safe strategy will bring you in last.  Unless you chance new card combos, you won't get the results, unless you dabble with the bonus cards you won't get the extras that can make all the difference. Artifact cards that give a huge shot in the arm from game start or nothing at all except dubious point bonuses that don't compensate for the gulf between first and second place. My issues with the game are that this luck will reward you or punish you. There is no middle ground or way to odds things either way.

Too complex for a gateway game, too random for the gamer who prefers a heavy experience. Great production, great gimmick, massively random game that I wouldn't want to play again.

*Tentative rating* This game combines deduction with worker placement; two of my favorite mechanics. However, after one play the game didn't resonate as much as I was hoping it would. It's a solid game and I see why people like it. The components and quality are very good. The use of the app is very well done. I also like how selecting turn order works. The penalties for guessing wrong on theories or drinking negative potions can be pretty brutal considering you are often working from "guesstimates". The game is also super-tight with money and actions which combined with the luck elements and length of the game don't quite sit right with me.

A multiplayer deduction game with secret information (ie. Clue). Finding a balance between doing actual research and just making wild claims (which is the easier way to get points points) means players can play the same game fairly differently. 

It is worth noting that if a player makes a logic deduction error in this game, they are absolutely hosed. You can recover from a calculated guess, you can not recover from an actual error. Playing out a game once you've realized the error is pretty close to the opposite of fun.

-i cant imagine boring another person to do the analog play
-mediocre workplacement mechanics
-the parts are fiddly.when you get up to see the actions 
on the board or artefacts cards you will always bump into your screen or see other players note.
-zero player interaction.you can be silent the whole game.
-playing this game is like a math class in elementary school.did you like math?
-unintuitive rule set and almost none thematic sense.its a very hard game to get into your head.
-if any hobbyshop employee recommends this as a family game slap him.

A core of interesting kitsch with a lukewarm game built around it.

The central bit of deduction is the strongest part of the game; the fast pacing incentivizes players to put some guesswork in before committing, but the punishments for getting it wrong are quite severe, and can create a large amount of swingy-ness to the game by getting it right (or wrong) early.  Hedging bets seems like a waste of time (just one point), beyond getting the per-turn thumb bonus for the last few rounds.

Most of the worker placement/turn order sub-mechanics are interesting, but nothing new or particularly clever.

Taking random resources seems like a consistently bad idea with rare exception; getting specific resources to do specific tests is the most efficient way to gain as much information as possible with as few tests as possible.

Each of the artifacts is extremely powerful, with some being more powerful (conditionally) than others.  The villagers are completely dominant over the random resources (for action selection), and might not be properly adjusted for in the ranks.

In the one game I played, I was able to deduce every single element by turn 4, due to both my experiments and other players' results/bunking/debunking.  

I find the iconography of the symbols very poor, and rather too small.  I could not imagine playing this game very well with bad eyesight.  Something other than the large/small sizes should have been used, probably two unique shapes.

Interesting worker placement and deduction game, but a little too long, a little too fiddly and analysis paralysis inducing. Complex for complexities sake.

The app is innovative, nicely done and enhances the experience, but replay-ability is suspect.

[b]Have not played yet. Want to.[/b] I saw a run through by Radho, and this looks clever. I typically like more interaction between players, so I'm hoping the deduction element would keep me engaged enough. I'm a little concerned about replay value as well, especially after hearing some criticisms about the deduction part...

I felt so stupid the first time I played Alchemists. My wife and I both agreed that six rounds wasn't enough time to figure everything out. But the more we play it the faster we become at determining the chemical makeup of each ingredient. It is a fun (even though we can suffer from AP once in a while) thematic game. Not only do you feel the pressure from the other players, but you always try to beat your personal best with each game. I always want to play again and try to figure everything out faster and better. 

Always a great experience.

Actually there is not very much game in there. The deductive system is well done and interesting, but not worth the playtime. Some rules are unnecessary strange and some players have a hard time understanding them. The componenents are annoying at a few points. Overall the game feels slow and too long.

Good game but the potion selling is weak and not much fun in a 2-player game.  3-4 player is better. In addition, luck can partially derail a game in a way that is not fun (especially for a game of this length).  Lastly, the game is fragile.  Make the tiniest mistake on your deduction sheet and your whole game is off.

Fun logic puzzle buried in a worker placement game.

The app is easy to use and really adds to the game. Well worth the investment.

// This was a gift from Secret Santa for Christmas 2015. 
Finally got a chance to play it after a lot longer than I 
want to admit - but I liked it quite a bit. More of a 
brain-burner than I expected. Not particularly complicated 
as far as the concepts are concerned, but some tough 
decisions to be made. The only detractor that keeps me from
 rating this higher is play length... but hopefully the 
game will speed up a bit as I learn it better.

With The King's Golem expansion.

Theme of this game is brilliant and it has one of the more fun to read manuals. The mechanics of alchemons and finding their corresponding ingredients is a really unique and fun puzzle. It makes first part of the game quite long with each player solving their own grid where they take notes of what they already know.
The second part when everybody knows most alchemons is faster and game changes its pace as everyone is trying to publish what they know and gather ingredients for final challenge. Artefacts are not well balanced and can change the game drastically. The app is a must have but it's one of the examples of good use of an app in board game.
For now I have a lot of fun playing it but I'm afraid it might get monotonic after more plays.. we will see.

This game is so thematic and so smooth. All the actions make sense, and it fits together so well. The deduction element is so much fun but the real key is figuring out how to turn your information into scoring points by publishing and debunking theories. I can't stop thinking about this game.

One downside to this game is it is difficult to teach. The selling potions action, the theory board, and the deduction elements are difficult for new players.

Este juego lo diseñó algún profesor de universidad, tiene los mismos componentes que el mundo académico, con sus publicaciones, refutaciones y por último un gran congreso donde todos deben demostrar lo buenos que son investigando. Publicar (incluso tonterías) sirve para ganar puntos, aunque el que te refuten (si lo hacen) te puede costar mucho. La cuestión es protegerse (en plan... "No estoy seguro"), pero entonces no podrás puntúar.
El pero, a veces se hace pesado y repetitivo, sobre todo cuando no hacen más que tocarte las mismas cartas.
Tampoco me gusta la poca interacción entre jugadores, pero será que a mi me gustan los Wargames.

Definitely a deep game which at its core is 'Mastermind'. A little too much fluff which I think if it was streamlined away would have made for a better game; too many generic worker-placement action choices each turn which distract from the deduction-core-mechanic. Still, the heart of the game was fun enough and it's very much a steep learning curve. Looking forward to seeing how it plays the second time when we play again in a few weeks.

This is truly horrible. Any game that needs an app to perform basic functions is ill-designed, to say the least. It's a mess of stupid little chits, unintelligible cards, a board that is almost impossible to read from any angle, and ludicrously overpowered bonuses that obviate 90% of the "choices" you make. It's a terrible, terrible game and everyone associated with it ought to be ashamed.

Very cool, original game. I'm not crazy about the app dependence (and I have major worries that I won't be able to play this in 10 years), but the game itself is really interesting. The deduction mechanic is far, far more interesting than what you find in most games (e.g. Clue), and the art and theme really bring the game to life. 

A couple of logistical problems I had: 1) the photo recognition on the app doesn't work well unless you have good lighting, 2) tokens fall out of the player screen easily (our first play was completely ruined when I accidentally knocked my screen and all of the tokens fell out!). The rules for disproving theories (and "hedging against" a color) are also really confusing, and I still don't think I quite understand them.

Really a great deduction game.  It's a bit of a brain burner, but playing on the master level really flushes the game out.  You almost always have to bluff and hedge your theories, which makes the whole game much more interesting as the other players try to disprove you.  The humor in the game is great too.

Well, Alchemists hit 10 plays, which is pretty awesome actually. But having now played those 10 games, I actually don't have much desire to play it again. It just became too rote, too routine, with some nasty coarse-grained luck and not much game-to-game variability. I'm still keeping the high rating because the play experience really was terrific for those first 8, 9 games, I easily got my money's worth, and I'm sure I'll continue to play it form time to time. But it's not the classic I somewhat optimistically hoped it might be.
---
Pretty sure the Magic Mortar is too strong. I've banned it in my games, at least until we're seasoned players. I would definitely recommend removing it for at least your first few plays. It may be balanced in the long run, but for beginners, I think it's extremely strong and you'd do best to play without in the short term. Every one of my first four games was won by the player with the Magic Mortar, and it wasn't even close. The game feels much tighter without it.

I really enjoyed this - my favorite CGE game now, even probably ahead of Galaxy Trucker! Of course, you have to like deduction games obviously - it's not going to likely to change your opinion on that count.

Pure deduction on its own is not, in my opinion, enough to support a meatier game. This is why I like Sleuth for its brevity and economy, but am not enamoured of games like Black Vienna or Code 777 which try to be more interesting by simply making the deduction logic excruciatingly hard. The Alchemists OTOH takes an interesting deduction "engine" and then blends it with a real resource management game: you have to manage your cash flow, your supply of ingredients, you have to keep pace on publishing papers, and so on. If you suck at deduction you can't bail yourself out by managing your money wisely, but neither will your deduction skills save you from poor cash management.

The alchemical rules have taken some flak for not being intuitive, and it's true they aren't. But while not intuitive, they are not complicated either, and you just need to be really sure you understand them clearly before you get started. The combinations that create water are the trickiest, and the key piece of information (not super-clearly highlighted in the rules unfortunately) is that adjacent similarly-shaded rows on the sheet make water. Once you understand the engine here I don't think The Alchemists is actually as complicated as all that. But you do need to get it.

CGE games have a history of being hopelessly overwrought, but despite similar appearances, The Alchemists is actually pleasingly economical in terms of doing what it sets out to do. It's still complicated of course, but all the complexity is in there for a reason which can be easily understood and so the structure of the game is not hard to grok and - importantly - remember once a few core ideas are understood. The rulebook itself is a vast improvement over previous CGE entries, the jokes have been limited or sidebarred and it's more effectively focussed on communicating the actual design.

(I should say though that I haven't played the Master-level debunking rules, which seem to add a substantial chunk of complexity)

Anyway, I have a mixed history with both deduction games and with CGE, but this game I liked quite a bit. It is a CGE game, and it is deduction game, so obviously it's a niche. But it's also artful and well-executed.

Interesting deduction game, original, with a well integrated theme. It uses technology in a clever way, which is rare and nice !

The deduction is extremely layered and complex, and it is fantastic. I wish deduction was more prevalent in the game. I usually win the game by focusing on 3 elements, publishing theories (mostly with hedged bets because I am not 100% sure about the composition, and it is a race to publish first), and obtaining relics. 

It is an very good worker placement game, with a strong excellent deduction element to it.

RATING: 7
Usually I'm not one for games of this weight and length, but I love deduction games and the theme feels tailor-made for me, so I took the chance. I'm pleased to report that I find the game pretty damn enjoyable.

Figuring out how to most effectively deduce anything in this game allows for some really clever little tricks. It's less in the thought process for deductions and more in how to optimize your plays on the board for maximum deduction efficiency.

In general, the way you score points is all pretty fun and interesting stuff. The fact that points have an in-game use is nice, but moreover the strict turn / action limit means trying to score as much as you can as fast as you can makes for really nice pressure throughout.

The two player game and four player game are pretty different (I've not tried 3p yet). 

Four players feels more interactive, but also just feels more like a standard worker placement game. You can do less deduction individually and have to rely more on the greater WP strategies in order to succeed. I'm also kind of put off by the uneven number of player turns in 4p - this is not the kind of thing I usually gripe about, but in a game where turn order is [i]so[/i] important it feels wrong.

Two player feels a bit more relaxed as you have more time just to do your own thing and deduce things for yourself. As the deduction aspect is more pronounced with 2p, the game feels a little more unique here.

Controversial opinion time: But I think that because there is so much going on in the deduction portion of the game [i]and[/i] the severe turn / action limit you're up against that this isn't a game that really even benefits from increased player interaction. There's [i]so[/i] much going on in your mental space already that the mere thought of [i]someone else beating you to your latest deduction[/i] can send you into frothy rage. This is when the "race to see who can do something first" style of player interaction really works - the tension is ALWAYS high, even when formal interaction is low. Scoring points is precious, and seeing someone just just [i]one more[/i] causes some real anxiety in just the best way.

A complaint: The artifact cards just seem TOO powerful. A lot of the best cards are the first batch of cards available, putting you at a severe disadvantage for the whole game when you're NOT the one to acquire the best card. I know it's supposed to be incentive for competition, but the fact that in our two games so far the winner was someone who'd been helped along the entire game by a really great artifact just left a sour taste in my mouth.

Right now I'm really liking this game, but I'm not sure how much it will hold up over the long haul.

Also I can't get enough of that cat. Look at him! LOOK AT HIM. HE IS RIDICULOUS. When I am a mad, yet genius alchemist someday I will have a cat just like that.

Love this game!! Such an interesting mix of deductive reasoning and strategic risk. Every new player I have played it with goes through the same process. At some point in the 1st game they stop and go "Oh...I get it!" Immediately after the game ends they want to play again now that they have a better understanding. After the second game they want to play again because now they know it well enough to apply strategy.

One of a kind type game. The deduction is fantastically good in this, and I don't mind the app one bit. The deduction will lead to much AP, there's a lot to take in and figure out. Turn order is extremely important and the art is awesome. I really wanted to like this more but I fear it won't come out often. Mainly because the game runs a bit too long and it's difficult to pick up and play. I also question if this will hold replay value over time. Overall, I did like it and wouldn't mind playing more.

Gameplay alone wouldn't be an 8 for me; probably a 6.5 in that regard. However, great artwork pushes it higher, as does a bunch of fiddly bits and the fact that you are never bored, as you are always trying to figure out the game's central puzzle. The board, gameplay, and even winning feels like an afterthought in this game, which is what makes it excellent.

I was highly skeptical of the whole smartphone integration, but it really works in this game. It is a cool way to automate a "game manager" (someone could do this boring job if no smartphone). The smartphone randomly matches alchemicals to ingredients and its your job to figure out what is matched with what. The gameplay is worker placement with some Fresco thrown into the mix. Most of the game you will be mixing two ingredients together trying to gain knowledge about the hidden information.

This is truly a unique gaming experience. I've not played anything else like it. And, I can't imagine that anyone could conceive of a game like this without the benefit of all the creativity of modern board game designs in the last 15 years.

This is a tough, unforgiving deductive game. There's no way you're going to introduce this to casual gamers. Plus, there's more to the game than simply the deductive puzzle. Turn order matters... racing to claim artifacts and other scoring methods matters... yeesh.

I'd happily play this again. The app integration is genius. But there's no way I need to own this. Who the heck would I play this with other than my own gaming group?

I absolutely loved this the few times I have played it.  Teaching is always a bit of a chore, but the players tend to get into it once they get past the learning curve.  I love the different ways of going for points, and the artifacts really change up the game, although they might feel a bit too powerful sometimes, I can't say I've needed them as the only path to victory.

Combination of clue-style deduction with resource management, play order bidding and possibility of bluffing for prestige and to mislead others. Does require significant thought to play but it's well worth the brainpower investment. The use of a phone-based app to assist with the game is excellent fun and a satisfying game element that makes this easier to learn. The game play itself is not too hard to learn but the strategy and tactics are very sophisticated (I haven't fully figured it out yet). Only downside is you do need to be in the mood to make the brainpower investment, not a game to play when tired or tipsy.

This is a hard game for me to rate. 

On one hand, I have the utmost respect for the design of Alchemists. The deduction is incredibly clever and the worker placement aspects are unique and interesting. By itself the design is a 10.

However, I feel that once you understand the puzzle of the deduction the appeal starts to wear off. It then becomes more like a 2 hour Sudoku puzzle which requires you to fill in the starting numbers yourself. 

After a few plays, I'm just not sure I need to play it again so I think a 7 is more appropriate.

Cons:
- Takes a long time to teach.
- Some aspects of the game seem convoluted or poorly signaled. (fake publishing papers)

The main joy of Alchemists is in deduction. You receive new information as you progress and try to understand what is what. All the selling potions and publishing papers is just an extra strategic layer on top of this base joy. Sometimes that extra strategic layer doesn't feel compelling either. It's not immediately when it's worth it to publish a fake paper, for example. Were items really a necessary aspect of the game? Does there really need to be two different way to test potions (on yourself and students)? Some of these actions seem like complexity for the sake of complexity; it definitely doesn't feel elegant. On the other hand, without them, the game would just boil down to sudoku. So while both the deduction and strategic aspect of the game is enjoyable, neither are really that compelling.

In my opinion if logic puzzles are not fun for you then this won't be either.

Remarkably astute microcosm of academic research. No individual aspect of the game is overly complex, but there are a ton of rules and mechanics that you need to learn before you can play. 

Not a point-and-shoot game. Game play lasts well over an hour, despite the small number of rounds. Extensive planning effort is rewarded heavily. Several good ways to win, seems to be well balanced so far.

Liked my first play more than expected. Tempted to buy it. The app also worked better than expected, and doesn't make the game not feel like a board game. Although it's completely retarded how the app can reveal everything in the middle of the game. Yes, I know, don't play with cheaters and all. But I prefer a "trust but verify" approach. I am terrible at deduction, and would probably never win, but I found it much more interesting than the last deduction I played: Sleuth.

I enjoyed it but my fellow players did not. It is a bit too complicated for what it is.

Enjoyed this game, which utilizes smartphones to good effect. Having a smartphone is not essential, but if no-one in the group has one, then 1 player must be a 'games master' and sit out from the actual gameplay! Uses logic problem solving as it's core mechanic, so if this is not your thing then I would suggest it's not suitable. This is combined with worker placement and hand management, and can play reasonably quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
If you stop at deduction you will miss the layers of the game.  You need to time actions well with your worker placement to aid in your deduction. Some strategic guesses in the middle game before you have completed your deduction can be a key to higher scores. 

Why I got rid of it - Too much to teach and too long to play too often.  This means I must learn it again and teach it again.  Aghhhhhh

I was a bit skeptical towards the app that has to be used with this game, but it worked out surprisingly well, and quickly became one of my favorite features. Really dig the theme in this game.    
EDIT:
After 3 plays, I still like the game, but it has some serious flaws. Some of the artifacts are crazy overpowered, like the one that let's you keep one of the ingredients, or the Periscope. You can also get screwed by the draw of the cards, you can either get a great hand, which makes you practically unstoppable, or you can get stuck with crap, which puts you out of the game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I quite like: that the deduction isn't all of the game (just one driving factor); the publishing/debunking wars, (particularly the pressure to publish even when possibly (or definitely) wrong); the use of an app to avoid needing a moderator/GM for a hidden-information deduction game.

I'm lukewarm on: the deduction itself. It's clever in its nature and a fair bit of fun, but can also be pretty AP-inducing, and lucky hits early on can give some players much more information than others.

The rest of it... functions, and serves the game well enough, but doesn't feel especially coherent? Or maybe it does, but just doesn't grab me. A dash of blind-bidding for the potion sales, an artifact market for another way to use gold, Do A Special Thing cards... There's also several value cliffs (enough gold for an artifact, enough unused cubes for DAST cards) that felt more frustrating than interesting. The initiative mechanic is neat, at least. And there are some nice thematic touches throughout - expecting more from higher-Reputation alchemists, etc.

I have gaming friends who rate this a 10, and others who rate it a 3, and I can kind of see where they're both coming from. I'd play again if offered, but only if a turn timer or hard game-end deadline were involved.

Components: Gorgeous artwork on the board and cards. Fun little potion bottle pawns. The app works fairly well.

Experience: First game at just over 4 hours, not counting rules explanation. That's way too long for what it delivers.

The core mechanism that attracted us, of trying to deduce the alchemical for each ingredient, is only a small part of this very complicated game that has bidding, resource management (the ingredient cards), worker placement, variable player powers (the artifacts), take that (some favors), and area control (publishing). Way too much going on for my tastes. If the game were a third as long, with half the complexity, I'd try it again.

Reminded me a lot of Dungeon Lords, in that the new, exciting mechanism (building a dungeon, deducing ingredient alchemicals) is overshadowed by a complicated worker placement game.

Played once at Draughts. Lost by an embarrassing margin after completely misunderstanding a rule - I think I would have still lost - but by a much smaller amount - if I hadn't. I'd like to play this again, but am concerned that there is a bit too much luck in the potion-making - if you get the right cards early on, you'll find it hard not to win. Update: Played a second time and if you make an error with your logic, you can't do well. No recovery mechanic really harms how good the game is

Quite a polarizing game.  Our group played two games simultaneously.  About half said they would never play again, a few liked it and the rest were ambivalent.  Our game with 3 players, with two new players, took 3.5 hours with rules explanation.  The combination of deduction and worker placement tries to wed two almost-satisfactory elements into a greater whole, with mixed results.

I think the game would play equally well without the theme-infused elements like the artifacts and the negative effects of drinking your own potions. 

I would be curious to see a different game with the same deduction core.  Take out the fantasy theme and the workers, and just use the app and the ingredients.  You could make a 45 minute game out of just the deduction bits.

So this is the sort of amazing Euro that mixed in a theme and *WOW* the theme really carries through. Great art aside, you really feel like a near-charleton level Alchemist/Academic exploring your "Art/science" trying to lay the groundwork to advance ahead while committing slap dashery snake-oil level crimes.

The humor comes out in the play and not just the presentation, which is a good plus. This speaks of truly inspired and skillful game design, IMO.

Setup time and putaweay time's are beastly... Just beastly, but this gets better, like any game, as you get to know it.

The components can be a little bit fussy (the cauldron especially), but the APP used in the game really is clean and works well.

Rule book has maybe two minor problems: YOU GET 2 GOLD TO START... but is otherwise well written AND entertaining, which is another rare combination. Truly good game. Rating may go up if it has legs.

Honestly I think it's overated. It takes a long time to setup, it takes a long time to play.

The biggest pro is the price. You definitely get a lot of thinks for your buck.

Not only the theme and the visual aspect, it´s also the concept that makes Alchemists a game to look for: The search for the solution of the "puzzle" about the components of the ingredients follows the footsteps of the scientific research, with the reprodution of the experiments (through smartphone), with the hypothesis, the refutations, etc.
Although a bit luck dependent (if you get only water from the experiences you make), or a bit awkward (if you refut you are not allowed to publish in the same item) this game still has a lot to justify its appeal.

Great parody of the modern scientific process ('publish or perish'), wonderful artwork and great mechanics - even the app is superb. I don't have much to critisize other than the fact that an early mistake can easily cost you the game and the start can favor the lucky (at least I felt horribly far behind after brewing 'soup' for the second time).

It is also quite long for a 4 player game. 

For around 30 Euro, you won't find much better games of this size and heaviness.

+ Awesome melding of deduction and worker placement
+ App keeps one player from being a woefully bored GM
+ Beautiful artwork with good piece production quality 
+ Moderately simple mechanics, yet deep enough to make each game challenging
+ Game duration/number of rounds is the perfect balance of being able to potentially discover all the components stats, but does not gaurantee it every game
+ Little to no turn downtime
+ High degree of replay-ability
+ There is a plateau at which a veteran player can reach as far as strategy, however, given the randomness of the resultants for every game, a newer, or even first time player can easily win against someone with multiple plays under their belt


- So many little pieces, with a lack of decent method to sort them with what comes in the box
- Sitting your cards on the cauldron screen is finicky, with cards falling through the slot more often than is acceptable
- Potion result tracking board does not hold the tokens quite snugly enough, causing any bumps to your cauldron screen to be catastrophic (which is bad if you're a klutz like me)
- The app camera CAN be finicky, but I've personally never had an issue with it. Keep your area well lit and it should never be an issue

I like [i]Alchemists[/i] although I seem to be very bad at deduction. I struggled through the whole first game just trying to deduce anything. It didn`t help that you also have to pay attention to the worker placement part of the game. The alchemists is one of these games that needs repeated plays in order to get the whole experience and this might proof to be a problem since there is quite a lot of rules overhead. This means it might not be that easy to get it back on the table which is a shame since I`d like to explore it a little more.
At least, I`ve played the deduction part a few times solo so that I won`t be totally clueless the next time I get the chance to play. And I do really want to give it another try!

:star: Hard to teach. Like in most CGE games, there are a lot of little rules. I guess they are necessary to keep the game interesting once you`ve figured out the deduction part. But this makes it hard to get new players interested in the game.
:star: The app is more of a tool than the central element of the game.
:star: The color choices of the playing pieces were a bit problematic for some players under bad lighting.
:star: The two hour playing time on the box seems to be correct after one or two games.

[2016-04-04 Second Impression]
It's been quite some time between my first and second play. As far as I can see, there are two reasons for this: 

First, this game is a monster to teach. The second time I needed nearly an hour to explain it to a seasoned gamer. It's not that it is very difficult, there are just a million little rules to explain. This is a huge hurdle when trying to get it to the table. At this point in my life, gaming time is very limited for me and my friends and sometimes we don't have more than two hours to play games a week. So, a long game with a long rules explanation just doesn't hit the table very often. This might not be a problem for you, but for me and my group it is.

The second point may be of more interest to anyone interested in my opinion of the game. I just feel that Alchemists could have been more streamlined. I'm a huge fun of games with little rules overhead and a lot of depth. In both my plays of Alchemists I felt like a hodgepodge of ideas was put into the game but somehow they do distract from the fun core of the game. Maybe most of the stuff might get valid and second nature in your tenth play, but currently it just keeps my friends from requesting the game again. A common complaint I've heard: "The game isn't rewarding enough for the time that is needed to play it".

Don't get me wrong: I'd still like to give a few more tries, but I fear that I won't get the chance to do so.

Fun games and 13+ are a good recommendation because you need to think and develop a theory.

A lot of investigation to fully understand all rules:
A video on how to *plan* for the last round or better instructions for the last round is needed, all videos out there "mysteriously" just jumps over that part ... with the words "I got x many points"

A very enjoyable game, though quite tricky to get your head around the first time, once you have played it through however, it does all become clear.

You play a wizard, or alchemist, who wants to be better at his job than the other alchemists playing the game. So you must decide how best to spend your time in order to succeed at this task and decipher the components of a handful of spell ingredients and then publish theories about them. Be careful though as a challenge from another player could result in shame and a bad reputation.

Phenomenal deduction game. If you're at all a fan of deduction, but wanted more substance than just gradual sharing of information, this is the way to go. Game end is always exciting, during the 'reveal festival.'

While the app is a mandatory element of the game (ignore the non-app variant - it's mandatory as far as I'm concerned,) this is by far my pick for 'best implementation of an app in a board game.' Seamless, fun, engaging.

This, I think, is about as close as a board game has come to approximating what real science is like.  You're in a race against the other players to probe, test, and experiment your way to understanding a part of the puzzle.  There isn't time to do the whole thing, and you need to get published to secure some of that sweet grant money, because funds are always tight.
It's difficult and thinky, and not something I'd want to do all the time.  The fact that you need an app, or to have one person sit out and be the moderator, is kind of annoying, but it wouldn't work otherwise.  If you're in a space with lots of games going on, you might be able to ask someone at the next table to take a few minutes out of their game when it's not their turn to help you.  And most everyone has a smartphone these days, so it's not such a huge problem.

Not really sold on some of the mechanics.  In our first game, I bought the coupon that discounts magical items, then nearly won by just collecting crap instead of playing the rest of the game.  But money is tight, and if the customers come out at the wrong time, you won't be able to sell them something they want.  
Also, the system for placing claims on the board is a little unintuitive.  You can either publish and score points, or hedge your bets and put out a placeholder.  The placeholder will get you grants, and let you publish, but isn't worth any points.  But you could also just take a 50/50 shot and put out your real one, gambling that your guess is right and risking losing points.  And if someone else puts out something you know is wrong, you have to burn your precious actions and resources disproving them and submitting your own claim.

I want to give this a few more tries and see how I feel about it then, but enjoyed it pretty well the early times.

A very good combination of worker placement and deduction, it went over well with everyone I've shown it to so far. The one downside is the game is just a bit longer than it feels like it should be and it feels like the worker placement just slightly takes away from the deduction elements and that the game might be a bit more fun if it focussed more on the puzzle solving aspect than buying and selling potions and artifacts, etc.

Still a great game though and the ability to find multiple paths to victory is a good side to the worker placement areas I mentioned above.

I enjoy this most because its good satire on academia. A funny and clever is possibly slightly over done game. At its core you are playing something similar to Sid Sackson's Sleuth except you need to indentify the three colour constituents for each ingredient by combining them in recipes. Over the top of this is a fairly full on worker placement game which meters out actions such as selling your potions getting extra ingredients and publishing your theories on the properties of a given ingredient for academic prestige. What makes it really great is you can sort of lie and get away with it in a game that isn't really about bluffing.

I hated this game the first few times I played. The game made me feel stupid because I had a tough time working with the deduction portion. Combine that with the punishing scoring whenever a mistake is made caused me to really dislike the game.

However, after giving it a few more plays, along with lots of strategic discussion with my wife, I have very much changed my tune. The game is hard, but very fun. The academic theme is incredibly on point, especially since it has such a light-hearted take on the theme. The deduction aspect is fun, and not as gimmicky as one would expect. The app integration is smooth and doesn't hinder or distract from the game. The game also has many more valid victory paths than I initially thought.

I look forward to playing this more and more.

2015-05-12 : A simple deduction game with a huge luck element that takes twice as long to play as it should “thanks” to the iPhone gimmick. There are games that are really enhanced by having an app – games like One Night Ultimate Werewolf – and there are games that should have been designed without one – such as this game.

Basically this game boils down to : pick 2 random cards – check what the combination-result is – rinse & repeat. If by simple deduction you’ve narrowed the choices down somewhat, then is the time you need a specific combo of cards to get any further.  And those cards will or will not be available. If they’re not you can either do nothing or gamble. Gamble correctly and you win the game. As a deduction game this is worse than Clue.

And if the game didn’t have enough problems already, it’s pretty clear the sell potion / adventurer part of the board was already drawn before some last minute rule changes were implemented.  Not that those changes worked because adding another random factor - the discount cards - to an already random game really doesn’t help.

Most overhyped game of 2014 – by a mile.

Picked this up at pax east 2015 and it quickly became a love at first sight game. I love the art and its such a great deduction game of deceit, bluffing, taunting, and just general good fun. 

I know it uses your smart phone or mobile device but I quickly got over it once the awesome flow of the game became apparent. I've played it 4 times since I've bought it and can't wait to play it again. I would warn you this is not a game for those who don't like to use their brain a lot. The deduction can be unforgiving if you make a mistake.

Everyone seems to have enjoyed this game. Everyone seems anxious to play it again. I was worried this game would end up being to complicated for a lot of people. That hasn't seemed to be the case. Or at least even the people who don't truly understand how to use their information (which seems to be the majority) still enjoy the game despite not fully comprehending it. It has a very Dungeon Lords feel to it, yet not as confusing. I love that the core of the game is a logic puzzle that you are trying to piece together and then leverage for points. 

Very neat design and good use of an app, that seems totally interracial to the game without being excessive. I will warn that I've seen the app mess up a few times, so make sure to double check your picture. And also make sure to double check your ingredients before taking the picture. Once you take it, you gain information, so you can't really take it back.

One of the most puzzle-y games I've ever played. I love the deduction, guessing, and sometimes bluffing, that occurs with publishing aspect of the game, but the game as a whole feels rather rigid. Actions are incredibly limited, and money is tight, forcing you to make decisions with limited information. Granted, that is the point of the game, but I wish ingredients and money were distributed more liberally. For a fun solo experience, open the app and play through the chemical/ingredient puzzle; it is very fun even on its own.

In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories – correct theories, that is — and therein lies the problem.

The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards. Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.

During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.

Let's make things clear. It is not a board game by pure definition. In practice it needs app to work. Nontheless it is pretty fun and interesting to play. Also, it is one of rare cases where euro mechanics fits perfectly for a theme.

Update: Unfortunately this one doesn't have much replayability. After 10 games strategy starts to look the same each time you play. In this regard it is typical euro with this huge flaw.

In theory, I still think this game has too much going on with a surface-level deduction "gimmick".  In practice, I'm still enjoying it and actively seeking more plays.  It does have more moving parts than the decision space justifies, but the deduction element, as well as the "race to publish" makes it tense and interesting, even if there's a falseness to its depth.

I love, love, love:
- the application of testing and deduction and the scientific method (especially in Debunking)
- the nod to the current state of academia
- the wonderful humor of testing on students, buyers, and ourselves!
- the art, personal cauldrons, and deduction trees
- the thrill and trepidation of publishing theorems you're not always totally sure about
- spying on your archenemies with a Periscope, seeing them lose reputation as they frolic naked in the streets, and more
- the bidding war for the opportunity to sell to a willing sucker--I mean, well-informed buyer
- the WP mechanism of choosing all actions last to first then carrying them out
- the theme of alchemists, alchemicals, magical items, and academics
- the equal focus on a Euro game and a deduction puzzle
- the relative simplicity of the deduction puzzle
- that there's a Master variant to make the game harder
- the rulebook is funny and very well written

I dislike:
- that the deduction sheets are not very easy to see

Final verdict: Great mix of humor, theme, worker placement mechanisms, planning, and deduction.

A constantly confounding balancing act of deduction, resource management and bluffing. The best deduction game on the market, by far. Thematically, and narratively, interesting and engaging.

Alchemists is a very unique game which combine euro with deduction and the use of smart phone app. Because of this combination, Alchemists can be played as the original game ("complete" as it is), a deduction game (stripped the board and focuses on mixing the potions) or a pure euro game (using the gamemaster board to provide players with the alchemical formula and eliminate deduction).
While without hesitation I'd say that the original version is the best, the other variants are still interesting to play.

Alchemists is one of the most AP-inducing games I own, to the point where I am terrified of the prospect of playing it with the full player count.  It blows the AP of Five Tribes completely out of the water.

Still, the deduction game of figuring out the alchemicals is really engaging, especially when played with the advanced rules where some educated guessing becomes more necessary.  The game is also richly thematic in a way that brings me great joy.  As a former academic myself, I chuckle a lot when teaching the game - I love the little touches like testing potions on students, but the students want payment once something bad has happened, or the way you can knowingly publish nonsense and it's OK unless someone else questions it.

So, I rank the game very highly for the theme and the unique deduction puzzle.  However, when you start to master the deduction puzzle, other parts of the game start to show some cracks.  The worker placement can feel somewhat fragile, and the early game can be dominated by luck.  If I happen to make a potion in round one that I have enough ingredients to duplicate, and a hero wants that in the second round, I've got a huge leg up on all of the other players.  If I take a gamble on testing on a student, and someone else makes a bad potion first, I could be falling way behind in my knowledge of what's happening.  It can feel pretty arbitrary and random sometimes.  I also find the potion selling space to be the most frustrating in the game.  I really dislike the way bidding works, and how the space is limited so not everybody can sell potions.  It gives that one step of the game a mean streak that feels different from the tone of the rest of the game.

Still, despite the flaws, I find Alchemists really fun, and think the theme is delightful.  I don't play it frequently, but appreciate it as a really good game when I do find the time to dedicate to it.

RATING: 7
Wow this one is thinky, and brain burning. The alchemical matrix is straightforward but there are a lot of options as each component is one of 8 alchemicals and you are hoping to narrow it down by testing the ingredients in pairs.

I actually really enjoyed the deep brain burning level although even halfway through the game I had to keep asking exactly what my results meant i.e a positive potion means that the two ingredients both have a positive for that colour and one is big and one is small. It is actually a lot to keep track of and you have to be very careful because if you mess up what your test result means it can send you off down a completly wrong track.

The rest of the game consists of ways to gain money which in turn allow you to publish papers and gain reputation (victory points). money is scarce and victory points hard earnt. 

I really really enjoyed this one, (and a big thank you to Paul Grogan of CGE for teaching us how to play)

RATING: 4
While the deduction aspect is interesting, the artifacts and grants seem tacked on.  Showing other players your result didn't do anything for us since everyone always had a few different ingredients and we never knew what they were testing.

Overall I wasn't too impressed.  It's got a few interesting choices, but you still have to get ingredients and test, which is most of your actions, so you don't really have time to do much else.

If I want a deduction game I'd play Sleuth.

I loved the deduction puzzle in this game and the theme and art are all great. But the worker placement part of the game is so-so. The grants are nice in concept but didn't really work that well in the games I have played.
However what killed it for me was that I don't want to have to explain this game to new players. Getting everyone the understand how the puzzle works is just too much work for me and drains the fun out of the game.

Replacement +/- tokens received from CGE so I've removed my 1 rating based on the first print run production issues.  I still think the new tokens should have been made smaller still.  They are an exact and tight fit so are easily damaged when trying to remove.

I've managed two plays now and I'd say we're still at the learning phase.  Both games went down very well and  everyone liked the potion mixing, the deduction and the worker placement.  We didn't publish many theories in either game but I guess that'll come with practice.

Tentative rating based on two enjoyable plays.

The thematic mechanics and high end game components make this game pretty incredible for being a dry game at heart. If you take the time to translate what you are doing, it is a highly immersive game which is cool for such abstract mechanics (kind of reminds me a bit of Troyes in that regard). The game is a lot like what I want Clue to be: a clever puzzle/deduction game.

It would not be possible to play this without the interactive phone app, but I really don't like mixing digital tech with my board-games. In spite of that, it is too clever and fun to not enjoy.

I wasn't immediately interested in playing Alchemists when it was released because of the smartphone integration, but after coming to realize that the game is playable without the app (but avoids requiring a human player to DM the game) I knew it wasn't going to be an issue.  And, it wasn't! The app worked seamlessly with the game and Alchemists retained all the "board game" flavour that a box of cardboard and plastic should.  I know about myself that sometimes I really enjoy deduction games and other times they don't fly for me, so I was unsure whether Alchemists would work.  I really enjoyed reading the manual, however, as the humour did help digest a rather beefy game.  Upon play, I found I was rather overwhelmed by all the + and - symbols everywhere and began to go cross-eyed as I tried to figure out which ingredients reacted with other ingredients to create which colours and polarity symbols.  Plus, there were little fiddly things to remember about some of the WP actions, so that also frustrated my ability to keep everything in check.  By the middle I was getting it though, and the deduction element was intriguing.  It really is a game that has to be played once before you truly understand all the things going on and how they interconnect.  By the end, I felt the game definitely worked, but I was slightly more underwhelmed than I though I would be.  There was just enough in Alchemists that I found wonky that it fuzzied my enjoyment of the pure deduction parts of it - which also didn't build the way I thought they would.  There were several times when the deduction part really took a back seat to the bluffing, which was unexpected.  Anyway: Alchemists is a fine game but didn't create that sense of enjoyment in me that I think really should have been stirred given the theme.  I'd play again, though.  Not sure if my rating could go up, however.

This is a fun game, but it needs the right group: a group that already knows the game or who consists solely of people very good at fully comprehending new games.

Unfortunately, I don't see getting a chance to play this with the right group anytime soon.

First of all I would like to say that there is a lot to like about Alchemists. Theme drips from the game like water from a wizard’s beard in a thunderstorm. Furthermore, the artwork is great, the rulebook is well written and humorous and the game scales well at all player counts. I am also not one of those people who see the merging of board games and electronic devices as heresy, on the contrary this is what really drew me to the game.

However, having played the game a few times I have realised that despite all these good points Alchemists wasn’t for me. See my review if you want to find out why.

- I'd rate this game between 5 and 8 depending on the playgroup.  5 with casual players. 5 with slow gamers.  8 with fast gamers.  But, in the right circumstances, I must admit I really like this game, even with all the downtime and solitary gameplay.

- My first game (3,5 hours) I ended with 36 points, the owner of the game ended with 15, and another gamer (his 3th game) ended with 8 points (he bumped his player board by accident).  You start the game with 10 points...

Edit: I'm increasing my score because I can't stop thinking about this game - the theme, the components, the gameplay, it's all so good! One of my favourite games!

It's a great puzzle to solve and the worker placement shell around it just adds to the strategy. The components are magnificent, the little shelf for your ingredients is a wonderful touch. It's on the heavy side and you really have to pay attention, but it's not "mathy;" if you take proper notes everything should be clear. The only thing holding this back is the length, however it doesn't feel long while playing. In fact, the turn limit is excellent and ends the game just when the puzzle is starting to get solved.

Wartezeiten, Integration eines Handys ("oh, jetzt ist mein Akku leer...", "Mist, jetzt werden die Karten nicht mehr erkannt"), hoher Glücksanteil: Nachziehkarten (!!), Auslegereihe, gewählte Aktionen teilweise nicht durchführbar; kein Eintauchen in das Spiel thematisch möglich; Bluffen und einfach Mitgehen bei sicher wirkenden Spielern kann den Sieg ermögichen; Die zwei mit Abstand erstplatzierten Speler hatten deutlich weniger Information gesammelt, als die beiden anderen: Der Deduktionsaneil (das Herzstück des Spieles) ist also nicht relevant. Drei der vier Spieler heute fanden das Spiel schlecht- Rekord für ein abendfüllendes Spiel.

We received Alchemists this summer as a gift, and while we love it, it tends to hit WAY TOO CLOSE TO HOME as scientists - we're both PhDs.

The publishers hit the theme on the nail, as none of our science friends will play with us. They all say something along the lines of "I want to play a game, not relive my nightmares."

It's a great game though! We highly recommend it, just don't ask a friend to play who's paper was recently rejected

Very innovative deduction game. Works excellent although some things maybe could be thrown out (like bidding for discount in Sell Potion area or whole artifacts cards, from which some maybe a little bit over powered). Mobile app, which is almost requirement to use with this game (playing without is possible, but I would not recommend) is very simple and nice. It still doesn't steel anything from board game. This app is just helper - addition to board game experience. Overall - excellent game!

Rated as a 9 after my first play (2p) as this game is full of theme, appears to be balanced and has a nice mixture of deduction (potential for bluffing) and worker placement. 
The game plays well and the app is brilliantly intergrated with clear and logical interactions that make it easy to use. Its a shame about the print issues, but the gameplay clearly overshadows those (and replacement tokens are onroute to me) and after a few more plays i feel we will be able to put the rulebook to one side and really be able to enjoy this game to its full. 
As with most CGE productions the game comes with "expansion modules" in the box, so once you have got to grips with the apprentice game, the master version is just waiting to be explored -  this also allows for experienced and newbie players to share a game together; as these varients can be selected on a player by player basis if needed.
All in all, a great game that i hope will soon become a 10 for us. (December 2014)
* Rating Revision * - jan 16 ; score dropped to 8 as it just hasn't hit the table, be this due to game time, level of complexity meaning it's a task to teach to some newbies and the need to have an iPhone fully charged. We generally have struggled to get a game with our longer games and if we do get one to the table it's more likely to be caverna over this. Still a great, cleaver game but it's just a game we have struggled to play regularly.
Feb 17 - dropped another 0.5 as we haven't played in ages (like most of our games) and would need to start from scratch to learn how to play again really.

After playing once, I lamented that bluffing was so obviously not worth it-- it took most of the tension out of the game. It turns out that I missed a rule (the most-published player is supposed to get points a few times during the game) and that the "Master Variant" makes debunking harder. Knowing CGE, I assume the "Master" rules are actually the game as designed, with the others meant as a tutorial.

Would play again, but even if the risk/reward ratio for bluffing were more tempting, it's hard to get excited about the bog-standard action selection mechanisms when half the game's appeal is innovation.

Played the prototype back in April 2014.
The smartphone gimmick worked really well: set up a pair of ingrediens behind your screen and take a snapshot. Then the system will tell you the cross-reading of the match. Unfortunately you still have to mark the result on a board, but I see no reason why this bit couldn't go digital as well.

Obviously you still have to work out the relationship between the variables yourself, and this is where my brain refuse to play. So despite a simple and clever system, I didn't have much fun playing it.

Deduction game w/ worker placement. Fun but not what I'd want to play frequently.

RATING: 5
Incorporates action selection and deduction. The deduction is less pure than others, but still has enough substance to be engaging. It is an excellent game made worse by requiring each player to have their phone and app out during play. Additionally, solely as a worker placement it is lacking, same with a sole deduction game. Together the parts work together well enough. If players' can manage smart phones, there is something good but a bit too long with a bit too much added in here.

I mistakenly punched out the ledges where the cards go before seeing the instructions in the booklet.  Always read the first setup instructions!

Fortunately, a slip of paper in the slot makes the same bridge for the cards and isn't really noticeable.  Folding the paper so the point is in the slot and the two ends stick out at the player works best.

Juego que sigue la dinamica de "emplazar trabajadores" pero con una tematica original (desarrollar pociones), profundo, bastante elaborado y bien implementado. 

Es un gran juego. Calidades excelentes y una mecanica rica y elaborada... donde yo le veo cierto defecto es en el ajuste. 

En mi opinion, lo que ocurre es que la parte de la formulacion (la de los ingredientes y sus compuestos) es demasiado compleja. no me entiendan mal, no estoy quejandome por lo dificil, pero si opino que el juego se desarrolla a lo largo de muy pocos turnos como para que puedas conocer bastante bien la "piramide" de formulacion para esa partida (que ademas, y eso esta muy bien hecho, cambia de partida a partida), y a la vez la mayoria de acciones de emplazamiento del juego en cada turno (que a veces no lo parece, pero el juego no consiste solo en hervirte el cerebro con combinaciones de hierbajos y patas de conejo) son muy dependientes de que te enteres con la formulacion o no, y de que consigas los ingredientes que necesitas (para hacer pruebas o pocimas) que salen de un pool comun... 

en resumen, que te puedes pegar media tarde con la cabeza loca de que ingredientes necesitas para hacer la pocion tal o de los compuestos que forman la pata de rana... para que en el ultimo turno no puedas hacer la pocion para la exposicion porque el que va delante tuya se ha llevado el ingrediente de la pila que necesitabas. 

Asi que si me preguntan... "buen juego?" si. lo es. sin ninguna duda. "lo aconsejas para que me lo compre?" pruebalo primero. 

yo particularmente, para jugar una tarde... propondria otro juego. me van de un poco menos "peso" :D

My head asplode.  I love the deductive component of this game, blending ingredients and trying to identify combinations and publish theories.  I don't like the rulebook and I don't like some of the euro elements.  The sell potion component in particular is OVERLY complicated. Debunking and conflict are very nebulous and I wonder if the conflict piece was to cover some hole in the mechanics.  This game has an apprentice level and master level and I think I'm going back to apprentice level.
Regarding the rulebook, they don't lead with the object of the game(how to win) which for a heavy game is important to know as you try to absorb the mechanical rules.  Also, the rulebook is full of fluff narration-type text which again in a heavy game is just annoying.

Euro de col·locació de treballadors i de deducció que fa servir una App de móbil per generar els resultats de una combinació de dos elements.

El joc crec que es poc rejugable, i segons la sort que té cada jugador amb les pocions que fabrica pot quedar fora algú de la partida aviat. En alguns aspectes (dificultad, interacció, ambientació, etc...) em recorda al Dungeon Lords/Dungeon Petz.

Neat deduction plus action drafting game that flows well when you know what you're doing but is a bit of a bear to teach. I think it's a good game but the bluffing aspects for me are brought down by the length - it's hard for me to get excited about bluffing when if I am wrong or someone calls me out quickly I can suffer for another 2.5 hours and not catch up unless the leader messes up too.

I sort of wish there was a game with similar mechanics but played in half the time, but then it would lose a lot of the character this one has, perhaps.

The game is very hard to teach, takes up to an hour to do it. Maybe better if everybody playing has read the rulebook beforehand???

The game is beautiful, and components atleast OK. The deduction-sheets are crap, but fortunally there are better ones downloadable here on BGG.

Really like how they have integrated the deduction in this game with the other parts of it, and it doesn't feel like any other game I have played. Unique, mostly streamlined and very thematic!

Overall a good game, and after 3 plays I just want to explore the possibilities in this game more...

Update: 
After three plays in two days, I'm lowering my score to 8.5. This is because I know of no other game that I have played that has so many small extra rules, and every time I play, there is something new I discover (only three cubes first round, only first player to exhibit a specific potion in the exhibition gets a point for it etc etc...)

Update after 10 plays:
Never played the Master variant, as the debunking there seems to be hard to wrap your head around. For a game of its length, there is quite a bit of luck in it, which is unfortunate, but tolerable. No downtime to speak of, because when an other player takes a long time, you can take that time to check the boardstate and work on your deduction-grid. 
A heavy game in quite a few regards, but to be honest it is not really very deep. It most certainally works as a game, but definetly not for everyone...

RATING: 6
The learning of the rules/set up took about 90 minutes, nearly equal to the play time.  I really like the idea of using a logic puzzle as the foundation of a eurogame.  However development on this game ended up adding too much complexity to really be broadly popular.  Does seem like there is a golden ring there though if someone can manage to simplify the trappings.

Also, gorgeous art/graphical design, as CGE is generally quite good at.

This one I consider the most brilliant, thematic, strategic game I've ever played. Yes it's hard to teach and takes some time to play through and understand it but it is so much worth it. This game has everything I like in a game. The worker placement is great, the decision making is great and the deduction puzzle thing is amazingly good. The only downside to this game is that it's hard to teach and it takes time to learn it but you can't have everything I guess.

Lovely worker placement game with puzzle/deduction elements. Needs proper explanation and understanding of unlocking formulae to open the gaming experience.


Also, I like how players are unable to "block" others and deprive them of spaces like a traditional worker placement game, but going first still creates a massive advantage and is worth competing for.


Great and unobtrusive use of digital technology to enhance the experience. Also, not compulsory for purists :p Just get a friend to adjudicate (not that we've ever had to resort to that).

The app gives the master of decryption - so all players can participate in the game. To get your own overview you have to work with a sheet of paper - the app does not help you. In this case, the app is a meaningful supplement to the game - not a gimmick at all.

Very impressive and quality design. It's just very difficult to teach. The rules for alchemy take a good bit of explaining. The game can be punishing and it's absolutely brutal if you make an error in either your bookkeeping or logic, since early mistakes become the foundation for later deductions and cascade. Still, I feel like this could be a fantastic game if everyone is willing to suffer through 2-3 learning games first. Because most people won't be, I have to begrudgingly drop the rating for this one.

一個放在兩個探險者後(第三張)
一個放在最後一張探險者前(倒數第二張)
***5.每位玩家起始2元，行動方塊是玩家(6-5-4 for 2-3-4 p)，
第一回合都使用三顆，抽兩張幫助卡棄一張，
原料卡學徒模式抽三張，大師抽兩張，

推理內容其他都是公開的，神器卡不算。
7.理論版放置贊助板塊以及一個計分指示物，
藥性指示物放置一旁，鬥爭指示物大師模式才會使用。
8.使用APP共同輸入密碼。
遊戲進行:
1.遊戲總共進行六輪
A.由起始玩家開始輪流放順位軌並拿對應卡片或者幫助卡，
選擇第一個須付1元，抽卡都是從牌庫抽，之後順位照順位軌，
回合結束起始玩家標記向左傳(若玩家麻痺，則起始繼續左傳)
B.反順位軌放置行動方塊，一次全部放完，每人一排，從最下面開始放
C.所有行動從右下角開始順時鐘結算，每個行動先照順位作，在到第二排
**若反悔行動或不做行動可以將方塊移動到未使用區，
每兩個方塊可以抽一張幫助卡
行動說明:
1.採收原料:抽一張卡片，可拿翻開的或盲抽，不會馬上補完，全部做完後剩下的移除再補五張
2.提煉金錢:一張原料卡換取一枚金幣(蓋住棄牌)
3.購買神器卡:卡片左上角為所需支付金幣，右上角回最後額外分數，只有在第三輪會議結束跟第五輪會議結束會清掉換下個時代的神器。
4.實驗: 選兩個原料卡並用APP看結果，結果要公開，並放兩個對應的符號，一個到自己的公開圖版，原料卡蓋住棄至棄牌區，另外一個在自己實驗室圖板標示
**學徒試藥免費直到第一個出現負藥時之後都要付一塊錢
**自己試藥  若副作用藍色(失智藥水)扣一分聲望，綠色藥水(麻痺作用)順位軌變最後(多人照放進來的順位，起始玩家標記當輪跳過此人往左傳)，紅色藥水(免疫變弱進醫院)下輪該方塊移置未使用區，玩家少一個方塊
----------第一回合僅開放動作以上行動--------------
5.賣藥水:每回合一開始新的探險者會出現，決定賣的藥水種類(需兩個方塊)。
****賣藥水順序(若有多人要賣藥水)
在開始賣藥水前先用特價格決定賣藥水順位，每個人祕密出一張特價卡卡，如果平手就照原順位，決定順位是看特價卡上笑臉總和加上目前的聲望分數所提供笑臉(笑臉愈多代表賣給客人折扣越多，他越開心但你賺比較少)。
****聲望分數:
綠色區域(14~17分)加一笑臉，扣分也會多扣一分
藍色區域(18分以上)可多賺一元，扣分多扣兩分，
紅色區域(6分以下)少賺一元，扣分少扣一分
決定順序後，輪到你賣藥水時執行以下兩步驟
步驟一、先的人先選擇要賣哪個符號給冒險者(只能賣人數減一個，三人時，前兩個一組)，將其中一個方塊放置到該藥水下方空格，若無空位賣出則將方塊移置到未使用區。
步驟二、再選擇要配到什麼藥水品質程度，將另一個方塊移到標示上(每位玩家可重複採)
a.完全正確(顏色、符號正確)=>4元
b.＋－正確(顏色不對、符號正確)=>3元
c.中性藥水(中和標記)=>2元+扣1分
d.錯誤藥水(顏色、符號不正確)=>1元+扣一分
賣藥水跟試驗一樣，根據結果拿對應標記放在自己圖版 
**若你選擇C屬性但是配出AB其中一種只會得到2元不會扣分
6.發表論文:
 a.新論文:選擇一個成分標記放在一個元素格上，並放自己的獎章面朝下放在最上面，付一元且得一分。
b.支持別人的論文: 放獎章在該格下方並付一元給銀行，一元給前面的獎章所有人，不會得到一分。
*分數獎章猜對遊戲結束有分，元素獎章如果顏色對，猜錯不會扣分
***最先完成贊助版塊中兩個以上的發表的人可以拿走該版塊跟對應金幣，之後要完成其他贊助版塊就要三個都有發表才行，同時完成兩個的只能選一個拿。
7.反駁論文:
用APP反駁學徒模式只要指出一個元素不對即可，成功反駁加兩分，失敗扣一分。
****被反駁的如果獎章使用顏色跟反駁色相同不扣分，其他扣五分(不同色及星星計分)，所有獎章移出遊戲(反駁自己論文分數總和在加減)
****如果反駁成功且有行動在發表論文(下一格行動)可以馬上發表，但要是你反駁的元素或是藥性組成(可以將藥性組成移到正確元素上)，該行動方塊使用掉。
*大師模式必須指出哪兩種原料回合成出指定的符號，不管反駁幾個都是兩分，被扣分者若被扣10分只會算一次，如果發現兩個結果衝突，放衝突版塊在兩個元素上，且上面的獎章不能拿贊助，此兩元素也不能在被支持，直到其中一個被拿掉則衝突標記就移除
***一輪結束 
獎章發布最多的得一分，平手都一分(有紛爭標記獎章不算)
未使用區行動方塊每兩個抽一張幫助卡 
移動醫院內的方塊到未使用區
移除原料卡 補上新的5張
移除使用的探險者，開著的那張移過去並開新的
****如果是研習會議版塊，移到對應位置，下輪結束會開會議，並開新的探險者版塊，如果有開會議就跟據卡片上獎章數量加減分(有紛爭的獎章不算)
***會議結束放新的神器卡，之後起始標記換手開始新一輪
***最後一輪開始時放展覽會版塊取代測試藥位置
展覽行動更測試藥一樣，只是變成決定要你產生出什麼藥，成功加一分並放在大拇指向上的區域，只有第一個有分，如果該顏色兩種都產生就放在下面，加兩分，結束後一就會進行獎章最多的加分跟抽幫助卡並進入最後記分
*最後記分
1.所有名譽分就變成分數
2.加總神器分(魔鏡先算分)
3.加贊助分
4.幫助卡換兩塊錢，三塊一分
5.獎章根據結果記分，錯誤的扣四分(顏色獎章如果錯誤跟顏色一樣不扣分，超過兩個以上錯誤就扣分)，扣分跟顏色區域的額外扣分無關了
平手比錢

There's actually a good game here...but trying to teach this. I may just send a video to people I plan on playing this that explains the game a week before we meet up. 

Sadly it's coupled with the fact that one game will take 2-3 hours. Getting a game group isn't hard but playing one game for that long, they will punch me. 

I love the mechanics and  the app integration is great, but the game's length and rules throw me off. Sadly this is another game that I was sure of would be a hit, but it failed due to the fact that I will never be able to get a group to play this. This game could've used more streamlining and shaving off about 45 minutes from its playtime. I love the deduction aspect of the game and finding which combination of ingredients make the different potions, but the worker placement aspect and publishing theories...just made the game so overwrought. It's just too much in one game for me for a game honestly. Like I said heavy streamlining would've been welcomed.

This is a really cool idea; I'm kind of enchanted by the attempt to integrate deduction into, like, an actual game.

Oh, and the theme is awesome. The bluffing aspect muddies the waters a little. (1 play)

After my first game: Nice production quality (artwork, sturdy cardboard), but the fiddly bits are also a huge downside in my opinion. The screens are rather high, you constantly have to reach around or over to access the main board without throwing your bits around. Teaching the rules takes rather long, gameplay drags on for quite a while, too. I prefer games that are easy to start and show their depth and complexity during play. Alchemists boiled down to learning a number of rules, drawing cards (element of randomness/ luck) and some deduction. During the game, many choices appeared that were not particularly interesting since I either had no way of determining which would be better, or the best choice was pretty clear right away, devaluing the decision-making. Lots of ballyho, but mediocre gaming experience.

Has Vlaada Chvatil been using an alias of Matuš Kotry lately? :)

I don't like deduction games and if the deduction was all there is in Alchemists I wouldn't have valued the game highly and I would've got rid of it right away.  Fortunately there is more to it than just figuring out how to link 8 potions' ingredients (feather, toad etc.) with 8 particles (so called 'alchemicals').
There is a whole layer of euro-game out there: a competition for order of play and a fierce struggle for profitable spots on the board (this part reminds me Dungeon Petz) like the ones which allow you to perform lucrative sales to customers (and earn scarce gold) and buy artifacts.   
You gain VPs from different sources (publishing/debunking theories based on your deduction (or guesses :) ), artifacts, grants, conferences, exhibition at the end etc).  So – as you can see – there are many aspects of the game into which the deduction is merely (but skillfully) interwoven.  Still, one could argue that everything revolves – more or less remotely - around the results of deduction (or guesses :) ) anyway.  But these other aspects are interesting by themselves and make the game a siginificantly different experience than a usual deduction game.

An innovative, fresh and satisfying design.  Exactly as Chvatil would've done it ;)

This is one of my earliest Euros when I got back into boardgaming in 2015. I remember watching Rahdo's playthrough and so surprised at how the app works for this game. And the whole deduction part of the game works so well for my gaming group back then since we're more analytical players. We played this thrice within the week I bought it and this game quickly solidifies itself as my earlier favourites. 

The game in its core is a worker placement game. But throughout the game you're playing a mini game of discovering alchemical properties of 8 ingredients. That keeps players who "get the game" engaged since we're always wanting to find out what's the chemical components of all the ingredients. This works particularly well for an academic like me since its doing what I do in real life - publishing theories and debunking each others while working in the grand scheme of discovering the truth in each ingredients. Brilliant game.

Wow did I hate this game. Honestly based on my memory of the game the 4.5 I gave it seems pretty generous. My major problem with the game is the level of randomness. It's not necessarily the case that there's a lot of randomness but it has this odd dynamic where a small difference in outcomes can lead to a huge difference in points. And then this compounds, where if you fall behind you have to take bigger risks to get back in and then when those most likely fail, you're even farther behind.

It also has this odd feel where making some early guesses on the deduction before you've figured everything out is pretty heavily incentivised, but then you're in the dumb position of standing to either gain or lose a ton of points if you happened to guess right.

Though I guess they needed this system in place because the actual deduction is incredibly simple and so the challenge of the game can't come from there. I think I had everything figured out by about 2/3 of the way through the game, but then whether I could do anything useful with that came down to how well the adventurer happened to match with the ingredient cards that were available (or as was often the case, were top-decked).

So overall I think I'd say that this is a game with a really weak deduction system bolted on to an incredibly half-baked eurogame. Awful. I have no idea how this game isn't ranked in the thousands.

Alchemists is not the best pure deduction game ever, but it might be the best overall game featuring deduction out there featuring it as a major mechanic. The game provides opportunities to focus less on deduction and score points that way, but even players that focus on that aspect of the game will find the need to make some leaps of faith to get the answers they want. Featuring great presentation, great theme, and an app that fits naturally into the game, Alchemists is a unique game that is worth exploring.

Probably one of the heaviest games I own.  It is great though!  I think it has some incredible social game elements in it, which I feel is rare for how heavy of a game it is.  I am excited to get some more plays in and discover more of the bluffing elements of the game. The alchemical chart is intimidating and ultimately makes this game a game I would likely never introduce to a green gamer. After some more plays, I will provide a fuller review.  Right now, an 8.5.

I've only played once and I intend to keep it that way.  

The ipad mechanic is awful.  It slows down what would already be a drawn-out game (and that was just 3-player). 

There might be a mediocre-to-dull worker placement in there, but the components are a major barrier to playing.  They may look exciting, but trying to balance oversized cardboard counters up against undersized holes led to the inevitable clumsy hands (plus earth gravity and cardboard's low static adhesion properties) knocking them all on the table.  I couldn't remember where most of them went, but by that stage it really didn't matter.

The game taught me that I have difficulty distinguishing between slightly different shades of pastel colours, and difficulty recognising the difference between white plus and minus signs on a pale pink background.  Luckily those are skills I've never needed before, and if I avoid this game, I'll never need again.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (March 2014)

I was expecting a very good game from CGE and Alchemists doesn’t disappoint. Deduction is one of my favorite game mechanism and it is very well implemented in the game. 

The art is great, from the pretty player boards, to the colorful game board, the art really sells the theme. It has some resemblance to Dungeon Lords/Petz but that’s logical as all three games were drawn by the same artist (David Cochard). The game components are awesome, great quality cardboard.

When the game was explained to me, I thought it was a Vlaada game (but it is not :D), Alchemists has a similar feeling to some of his games.

The theme is great and the game mechanics do support it which is a rarity in an euro game.

Alchemists can be explained under 25 minutes and play time is around 2 hours. I have only played the apprentice version, but I really liked it. It has easy rules (lots of them), but the gameplay can be deep (medium weight) and it offers lots of interesting decisions each turn (which order of turn should I choose? Where to put my workers? Should I try the potion with my apprentice or with me? What ingredients should I mix?) with very limited resources so it has lots of tension. Money is very scarce and all the important actions require it. In particular I like to test ingredients so I can deduce what their composition, when you test there is a lot of tension in the table, I love it.

I also liked the game app which is definitively not a gimmick. We played it with an iPhone and 2 iPads and I have to say the pattern recognition seems to work better on the phone but it works very well on both devices. On the other hand, I really dislike that it is VERY easy for someone to cheat as there is a button in the app to reveal all the relevant info. Using the app for the game is mandatory, I know you could do without it, but then the game would be diminished. Another advantage the app has is that the game no longer can be broken due to a procedural human mistake which is a weakness most deduction games have. In Black Vienna if you give wrong information the game breaks, in Tragedy Looper if the Mastermind forgets to do a mandatory effect the game breaks, etc.

On the negative side, some artifacts seem overpowered, in particular the one that lets you retain an ingredient and the other that lets you peek at one ingredient of your opponents, not sure if that’s the case but I will play more to verify. It also has some luck of the draw with the ingredients but it doesn’t bother me yet.

Bottom line, Alchemists is a very good deduction and innovative game and one of the best 2014 games I have played so far. I’m glad to have it in my game collection. I can’t wait to play it again with my girlfriend who also loves deduction games. I’m also eager to see more games from Matus Kotry.

I like this game a lot, but I wish I loved it.  I love the deduction, theme, artwork etc. . . but this is primarily a different game with a deduction sub-game.  It's possible to win the game without knowing much of the underlying puzzle.  It has a lot of depth, the potential for double-bluffs when players have experience, and it's a tight game where you can get hosed by turn-order.  Still a very good game!

2016-04-10 - This is a really fantastic worker placement/deduction game. The integrated app is really great and really helps facilitate what would otherwise be a virtually unplayable game. The worker placement is really good; kind of reminiscent of Caylus or Yedo. The deduction is interesting without being too terribly mind numbing. Definitely worth checking out.

2017-02-03 - Alchemists is just flat out amazing. I love it so much. The deduction puzzle is always interesting, and the worker placement perfectly compliments and makes a game out of it. I've played this more than 10 times now, and I'm still excited every time I start a new game.

I like deduction games and as such suspected I would enjoy this. I did not expect that I would feel so much like an academic trying to discover and publish my findings prior to my rival academics! While the app is novel and well-implemented, the rest of the game holds its own. Maybe I'd prefer a little more tightness in the action selection mechanism. I am most impressed with how the drive to publish and endorse for quick points very much tempts you to publish findings you haven't quite proven...

It played a bit long, especially with teaching the rules, which can take a while, but the game flew by and I didn't mind the length at all.

At first glance this appears to be a logic puzzle, and it certainly has that. But that's not the game. It also has what appears to be a gimmick, a smartphone app.  But it's implemented very well, and merely lets the game work without a GM.

The logic puzzle is enough to scare a lot of potential players off.  But if you get your head around it there's a whole game built on top. 

This game is a parody of Academia. You are supposed to be on a search to identify the 8 alchemical reagents in the game, but what you really do is race to publish your findings, ideally before you're even sure yourself. If your peers make a misstep, you can score a few points by rubbing their noses in it. And you make money by trading on your reputation, selling potions of dubious quality to transients.

Excellent game that saw non-stop play during the Sasquatch 2014. If you like deduction you will love this game. Very smart and novel design with loads of tension and excitement.

-----------------------------------------------
Read rules Sept 2014

This is probably my most anticipated game of Essen '14. I really like deduction games and this one has a unique spin on the genre. Most deduction games have information on cards which the players see only some of. Additional information is gained by slowing seeing more cards and of course, deducing things! Alchemists uses an app (or web based program) to portion out the information. At first it may seem cosmetic, but it isn't. Accessing the hidden information in this way completely changes the type of deduction that is possible, and the dynamic between the players. Alice and Bob no longer have information you don't have, we all start the game in complete ignorance and must learn together. Of course, during the game we will learn different things.

The game is centered around 8 ingredients which are secretly mapped on to 8 'alchemicals'. Each alchemical has a red, blue, and green particle, each with a charge of either + or -. Hence there are 8 unique alchemicals. During the game you can mix two different ingredients together and the app tells you the result of the mixture. There are rules for how alchemicals react that I won't explain here. You privately note the results and make whatever deductions you can given the other experiments you've tried. Layered on top of this is an action selection system similar to worker placement. There are 7 different actions to choose from. Some help gather ingredients, some let you publish your theory of which alchemical a certain ingredient is. There are also special powers in the form of artifacts that you buy during the game.

It's a slightly complicated game. Medium, verging on medium-heavy. There are a lot of sources of victory points and ways to turn your deductions into winning. The art and presentation are top-notch, what we've come to expect from CGE. It's amazing the amount of excellent games they've published.

This game is a little Rube Goldberg-esque .. but I totally dig it... it's got an engaging little deduction system at its core .. but set in an interesting worker mechanic ... with enough wacky elements going on so that the whole thing is not "just" about the deduction play.  To me, the gamey bits and pieces work thematically... and keep it all really interesting.  Not everyone's cup of tea... but I would play this anytime...

RATING: 7
The integrated app is a true innovation and the main reason for playing Alchemists. Testing ingredients creates an astonishing tension. Drawing the right deductions from the information is challenging. Mastering or even understanding the puzzle is difficult on first play. Add to this an enormous amount of upfront rules overhead as well as a long playing time (>3 hours) and there’s an high entry hurdle. To work out as a game in the long term, Alchemists has to prove that the deduction part remains challenging and not too luck-based while hopefully playing out in a shorter time with experienced players. Not sure though this will happen as the cult-of-the-new likely will slur over this game.

Good game, but my god is it fiddly.
Explaining & teaching all the game mechanics and the deduction process is quite a chore. I wish the game came with some sort of cheat-sheet or reference for the deduction part.
I get the feeling there's too much going on, too many mechanics, situational rules and systems forced into one game. Oh and one mistake on your grid - and your are screwed for the whole game

But... great components, some clever ideas, just doesn't quite pull it off. With a bit of streamlining this could be a classic.

La parte de deducción, publicar teorías y refutar están muy bien, pero el tema de compra/venta de ingredientes, y sobre todo los artefactos, me parece que recargan el juego demasiado para lo que es en realidad.
Con ganas de probarlo de nuevo.

There are quite some game rules and components to get acquainted with. However, after that, the rules seem quite obvious and actions self explanatory. Of course, the cool app adds to a game charm. But the most interesting part is the logics of the alchemicals and how they match to form potions. Its not that trivial to deduce the information, I have still much to think about. I haven't read the suggestions in the rules, and I'll try to think of my own deduction rules. Although, the game contains some push your luck (or rather publish although you are not sure) elements, and you must do that, it doesn't ruin the game for me. Because of my conservative mind, I might be the one who doesn't win the game much.

Žaidimas turi pakankamai nemažai taisyklių ir komponentų, su kuriais reikia susipažinti. Bet po to, taisyklės atrodo pakankamai aiškios, o veiksmai lengvai suprantami. Žinoma šauni programėlė prideda žaidimui žavesio. Bet pati įdomiausia dalis yra alchemikalų logika ir kaip jie kombinuojami gaminant stebuklingus gėrimus. Ne taip paprasta gauti išvadas iš turimos informacijos, man dar yra daug apie ką pagalvoti. Taip, aš neskaičiau patarimų taisyklėse, bet aš pabandysiu sugalvoti savo išvedimo taisykles. Nors žaidime yra tam tikras savo sėkmės išmėginimo (arba kitaip rezultatų publikavimo, nors nesi tikras) elementas, ir tai iš esmės privaloma daryti, tai nesugadina man žaidimo. Dėl mano konservatyvaus charakterio, gali būti kad nebūsiu tas žaidėjas, kuris laimi daug šito žaidimo partijų.

I am really conflicted about this game.  I admired the design because I always thought it would be neat to have a deduction game where the deduction helps you toward winning but does not absolutely determine the winner.  I also enjoy the humorous commentary on the publish or perish nature of academia.  I was also rather obsessed with figuring how the deduction system work (mostly because I made some deduction mistakes in my first couple of games that I was eager to overcome).

However, the deduction element went from brain-melty in the first game to "solved" after playing around with the deduction system.  So what is left is the worker placement part of the game--while it is interesting, I don't know if it can carry the game.

The first couple of games took way too long (4 hours) because everyone was struggling with the deduction system.  This might be a reasonable game if it took an hour, but I don't know if the game can be brought to that length with experience.

RATING: 9
My only complaint is a possible lack of replayability - I'm not sure if the difference in the artifact breakout would be enough for me to stay interested ten or twenty games in.

Let me add that I'm one of the cranks who was skeptical about the app. Even though before playing this, I complained about having to download something, believe me, I don't think that aspect should affect whether you play or buy this game. The app works well, it's necessary, and it's not over-relied upon, either, and the game makes it waaaay worth it.

The deduction and strategy are both intense and completely intuitive. People might refer to this as a puzzle game like Mystery of the Abbey, but for my money, the incredible implementation and the surprisingly subtle analysis of how science works make it far more engaging. The gameplay, too. You aren't just asking questions; the game requires bluffing, double bluffing, keeping careful track of what you're revealing (or not), what your opponents are (or not)...

I really liked it. I think it's ripe for an expansion, though. I think the strategy is straightforward enough that if everybody just adopted the attitude that they're trying to win by finding out the truth and using deduction (rather than playing a social game), it would wear out its welcome, and that does seem like the best strategy, so...

One of the best games out there.
I see that many people have a lot of complains about it.
Most of them hate the fact that it requires an app to play well. (techphobs!) Silly reason imo.
Others cry about it's worker placement mechanism. Yes deal with it it's part of the game.
And many complain that it's a luck based game. It really isn't...

Play it more than 10 times and you'll realize it's brilliance.

Well balanced. High replay value game. Worth every cent.

Who will create the potion of victory?! Alchemists is a PVP deducing euro-style game that will have you wanting more! As an alchemist you mix potions to see if they produce results or cause your assistant to go a little batty. You deduce your way through potion after potion until you get the right recipe to props a theory and the one with the most victory points at the end wins. Get out of the lab if you can't stand the heat in this one! This is one of the more tedious to learn games but PHENOMENAL to play!

I like Alchemists. The way the Mastermind aspect interacts with the gameplay is really great. That said, it tends to go just SLIGHTLY longer than I like (most of my favorite games take 2 hours with setup, this takes 2 or more without counting setup). For being so long, I dislike how thoroughly a single mistake can screw you. Fail to recognize you're making an assumption somewhere? Prepare to lose ALL your points. Accidentally mix two ingredients you've already combined before? Prepare to fall hopelessly behind. Still, it's a great experience despite that.

Edit: Bumping this up to a 9. I see now that a single mistake doesn't screw you so badly as I thought, because you can get a TON of information just from other players' theories, even if they might not quite be right. Meaning you have somewhere to start from even if you bunk up your deductions. The increased pressure to publish in the advanced version of the game means more info flows into the game, and it is extremely fun!

If you liked those grid-based logic puzzles as a kid and want to turn up the heat to 11, try this. Don't let the app novelty fool you - it's not the focus of the game. Deductive reasoning will win (or lose!) you this one and the extra layers of academic simulation and themic hilarity make it that much more appealing, but as with most CGE games, it's a brain-burner. Also extremely unforgiving if you make a mistake.

Realmente es uno de los juegos de colocación y gestión más duros que he probado. Su fuerte componente de deducción lo hace ser un juego único.

Great game, unbelievably produced and sold for great price for what's inside. It's also full of theme and has beautiful, consistent artwork (kind of sweet but fitting).

The only problem is that it's heavy, really. Not in a sense that it's very hard to figure any good move but because you can make no mistake in the deduction step. You'll probably lose if you do. It's time consuming and demands concentration because it's easy to miss something in the process. Moreover, the actual game is a cool euro worker placement - around the information you got, it's not really a deduction game.

Also, it takes really long to teach the game properly. Like 30-40 minutes. That's why it doesn't sit on our table too often :(

A nice brain churner with mechanics that blend well with the theme of the game.  A little guesswork in the deduction might be required since it only plays in 6 rounds but I'd rather have a game that has some hint of luck than a game that is purely just solitaire deduction.

Would like to play a session with 3 or 4 players as the Selling Potions action in a 2 player game makes 1 player often lose out an important action.

Hmm... a bit confusing first experience: I really liked how the smartphone app works (but still I hope that these devices won't come part of game more often). Otherwise couple of MAJOR usability issues: 1) those little chits won't fit into the deduction grid holes. 2) such a small +/- icons in deduction sheets and poor printing quality 3) a lot of small little rules which means that teaching this game to the new players takes 60 minutes - which is too much I think. So some more streamlining and I might fall in love. Now Alchemists isn't that exciting and I prefer some other deduction games instead of this. Updated: because all these flaws I was ready to move forward and sold my copy after three games played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories – correct theories, that is — and therein lies the problem.

The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.
Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.

As a fan of deduction games I thought this might be the next great thing to get a fan of. Unfortunately my expectations were too high and it fell back in my rating due to simple gameplay problems like: too much that you can do in too little time, a bad structured manual that is just funny but somewhat comfusing and the deduction part becomes boring after some time since its always the same. It's okayish but nothing more.

RATING: 6.7
This is a Czech board game that feels in many ways like Dungeon Lords – funny fantasy theme, overcrowded board with somewhat fun illustrations, some worker placement-ish (but not really wp) mechanism, some heavy puzzle-solving and lots of fiddly rule details. The latter made it less enjoyable for me even though the idea is interesting – mix components to see the result of the mixes (trying them on an apprentice or yourself – bearing the consequences) ; make assumptions about the components’ attributes based on the results and get famous if you are successful. My only problem is that from the start of the rule explanation to the end of the game 4 hours passed – so even though I quite liked it, I’m not sure I want to try it again.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I enjoyed my first play but I have some uncertainties about the game.  I am unconvinced that some of the artifacts aren't potentially overpowered.  Money is potentially very difficult to come by. Don't be afraid to publish and even be wrong - just make sure you hedge early in the game.  In the same frame, don't hesitate to gamble a wee bit with your publishing of theories either.  I'm not certain one can really find out everything so focus on a couple ingredients early if possible.  The first game will take some time and rules can take a while to explain if you teach from the rules.  Our first game with four players and rules took us around 2.5 hours.

Alchemists has a lot going on. While the worker placement side of the game is fairly easy, the puzzle and deduction element of the game is pretty heavy.  During our first play, most of the time,  players were huddled behind their screens with pen and paper trying to solve the puzzle. This didn't make for a very interactive gaming  experience which is definitely one of the weak points of the game. But the puzzzle, the integration of an app, the design are all fantastic. I wouldn't mind playing this one again.

the fact that u need to find out what's the composition of each compount itselfs makes it very different each time u play(the app randomly devides the possibilities amongst the compounts). in the end u are most likely to set some untested potions to the  final test. this can lead to a unexpected faillure or such a releave when u find out that your test proved right in the end. i'm very willing to play this game each time, even more times after eachother right away. It makes me feel like a young wizard myself.

Originally I was concerned about how well the app (free) that is required for this game, and whether or not it would ultimately... well suck. Eventually my curiosity won me over and I bought Alchemists anyway. A pleasant surprise! The app works flawlessly and adds an interesting accompaniment to the game play. The game is both visually appealing and intellectually interesting. If you enjoy deduction and worker placement games I highly recommend: Alchemists!

Really this game almost needs 2 rankings. One for the deduction game and one for the game itself.

I feel that the deduction game is brilliant. Always enjoy cracking the puzzle, and the use of the app is fantastic.

On the other hand, I kind of feel like there is too much noise in the rest of the game. The special abilities, the researching, etc, feels a little flat.

Still a solid game. One I could see myself parting with, however, if the price were right.

Gran juego. No tiene demasiada interacción directa entre jugadores, sino que se trata de planear una estrategia con un ojo en tu zona de juego mientras que con el otro intentas averiguar, y si es posible echar por tierra, las de tus rivales al tiempo que evitas que ellos hagan lo propio contigo.
Hay que estar muy concentrado durante la partida pues hay que tener en cuenta bastantes factores antes de poder elegir la estrategia a seguir. Cualquier distracción o despiste puede echar al traste una ronda de juego (tiene 6). No es un juego rápido de jugar, pero sí muy inmmersivo y adictivo.

A la hora de crear pociones es conveniente seguir un método: realizar pruebas consecutivas donde al menos una de las cartas se repita permite descubrir con relativa prontitud qué especie alquímica está asociada a qué ingrediente. De esa manera se podrán proponer teorías certeras que nos darán PV al final de la partida. 

Proponer a sabiendas teorías incorrectas a modo de cebo para que otros jugadores las refrenden y pierdan PV al final de la partida es otro de los aspectos que me han gustado mucho.

La fase de vender pociones aporta un aliciente añadido al juego, pues entran en juego unas cartas que pueden modificar el orden de juego. No todos los jugadores pueden vender pociones en la misma ronda, luego las peleas por ser el afortunado que consiga vender las preciadas pociones están aseguradas, ya que es la mejor manera de conseguir Oro, muy necesario en el juego: comprar artefactos, crear/refrendar teorías/ crear pociones...

Es un juego lleno de posibilidades donde cada partida es diferente gracias  a la aplicación del móvil, todo un hallazgo.


Nota: 
Q dice que no le gusta que una teoría propuesta por un jugador pueda ser utilizada por el resto de jugadores para puntuar refrendando esa teoría. Cierto, pero el jugador que propone una nueva teoría disfruta de beneficios exclusivos.
Creo que el hecho de poder refrendar una teoría ajena no afea en absoluto la mecánica del juego, pues se pueden proponer teorías incorrectas a propósito para engañar a los otros jugadores.Además, el jugador que propone una teoría puede estar equivocado y arrastrar involuntariamente en su error al resto de jugadores que hayan refrendado su teoría, lo que puede dar sorpresas inesperadas al final de la partida.

El juego funciona muy bien con 2 jugadores, pues permite pensar estrategias a corto/medio plazo. Con más jugadores aumentan las variables a tener en cuenta y por tanto se pierde control. En estos casos, la mejor opción consiste en ser flexible y aprovechar de la mejor manera posible la situación cambiante de la partida en cada ronda.

Incorporar mayor cantidad de cartas de guerreros y de artefactos habría aumentado todavía más la rejugabilidad, lo que haría subir de nota al juego. Quizá posibles expansiones del juego solucionen este punto negativo.

Sept 2015:

Having only played this game twice I'm giving this a initial rating of 8. It's a bit of a bear to teach timewise, but once the game has been grokked it's surprisingly simple.

There are so many ways to deduce the various alchemistry of the ingredients and that alone gives this game a very high replayability. Add on a very solid and rather tight worker-placement game and you've got a dynamic experience.

I think this game has an excellent narrative throughout the gameplay and there is a satisfaction as it wraps up.

The app is perfect and handles the load of randomizing the keeping everything smooth and honest. I'm looking forward to seeing where games go with app inclusion from here.

RATING: 5
A very unique game with its deduction and innovative with its use of an app to facilitate it. This game's theme feels as much about academia as it does about magic (in a good way), as the whole publishing of results and debunking feels a lot like research papers. 

I would say that there aren't actually that many rules in this game, it's just how it works is so different from anything I've experienced that makes it so difficult to grasp. 

This game is more to me an action point allowance game than a worker placement, because you can't block people off a spot usually, it's just that turn order can be really important in this game.

The rules say not to mention the debunking, publishing, and the selling potions at the start of the game, but I would mention that the potions are a really easy way to get gold. You can actually get a lot of deduction from seeing what other people debunk rather than performing your own research, or sometimes even guessing when you are selling potions. Note that since you can only score at most 5 of the ingredients (besides the grants) getting points for reputation can also be quite important.

EDIT: The novelty of the app has worn off a bit and I dislike how much you are incentivized to do 50/50 guesses in the beginning of the game to get the bonus scoring and the grants. This takes away from the importance of deduction in this game, and while I don't mind 50/50 guesses as much for games such as Tragedy Looper, for a heavy Euro that is not ideal. I'm not sure exactly what to rate this, I made a major mistake that really screwed me over and had a terrible time because of it, but was already seeing I would not enjoy this game as one I rated an "8" beforehand.

EDIT 2: While the app is really well integrated I dislike how you can for the most part play this as a straight Euro, especially the need to "publish" early just to score points. That really pulls away from the deduction of the game (which also is starting to feel a little bit samey) and the feel of discovering a new element, and makes it feel much more ingrained in the lows of academia. Overall innovative, but once the wow factor wears off not as much fun for a person who likes his Euros less dry.

One of the first games that uses an app that I ever played, Alchemists uses logic and reasoning in a way that I rarely see in games. The entire game can be made or broken based on how you piece the clues together. Even picking the ingredients to test is a crucial element of the game. And being able to debunk people that are incorrect is a brilliant way to set up the game, particularly since you can hedge on colors when you publish a theory.

I wish I got to play it more often, but Alchemists will always hold a spot in my heart and on my shelf.

I could see this getting boring as people work out how to deduct more efficiently, but that would take a while. This was a very interesting game and quite enjoyable. The worker placement aspect really works and makes for some interesting choices when picking your actions. The App turns a clunky system into a pretty flawless and streamlined one. Would not play it without, enough people have smart phones it should not be a problem.

RATING: 8
Score is for 2-player game, and it seems like it'd be a solid 9 or higher with 3-4 players. Super cool deduction game with nice component quality. Overall it has a great blend of game mechanics (primarily deduction and "worker placement") so that you always feel like you're doing something meaningful. 

Pros: Unique deduction design that feels engaging and exciting, tight gameplay so that each turn feels like it really matters, minimal randomness with solid avenues to mitigate any randomness that does come up. 

Cons: Very steep learning curve/drawn out explanation process -- it takes a minute to pick up the "potion-making" pattern and even after that you have to explain the overall gameplay with lengthy descriptions of each action & its specific rules/exceptions/etc. It plays smoothly once you get it, but the overall "teaching" process to new players takes forever. Also, it's somewhat lengthy; it does depend on familiarity with the game & number of players (and honestly it feels like it goes fast) but you should expect at least 1.5hrs. We took 2 hours to finish our first 2player play-through. 

I'm eager to play with 4 people as I expect it'll be more cut-throat and challenging to take advantages with the added competition. I could potentially see the game losing its enjoyability if you played it super often (unlike games like, say, Codenames that are built for replayability) but it seems to have enough variation built-in that it'd last you a long time if you played semi-often and forever if you play less often. 

8.5/10!

I love logic puzzles and this is what you have here with some game mechanics sprinkled in to help out and make it a competition. Timing is really important and figuring out ways to get that extra research in. I've heard that there are concerns on how well the game will hold up under multiple plays. The aspects seem mixed up enough that it would probably be fine. Even so I'm sure that giving it a rest for a while will rebuild interest in it.

A solid worker placement game with a mighty dollop of deduction.  A fantastic game with great production values.  After I finish a game I want to set it up and play again.  Amazing game.  And the use of the app only adds to how interesting and unique it is.  I can honestly say I've never played a game like this before.  A little heavy for new players or people that don't play designer games often.  This obviously would not be for them.  But, I love it.  Can't wait to play it again.

Neat little game, but requires a free app. Kind of trial and error thing where you combine two things and the app shuffles what the recipes result in. You're testing the potions on students, paying for things, there's a little worker placement, and trying to make money by the end, including a little convention thing at the last round where you try and prove you've come up with a potion. Can have really funny results as things fail, and a neat little logic puzzle, and since it's shuffled and never the same. You also can "publish" recipes, and get prestige, but you can often do so without entirely being sure. Also more about the qualities of the ingredients rather than strickly X + Y = Z.

Interesting game of deduction with nice theme and components. The whole eduction aspect of making potions and figuring out what the ingredients are is quite fun, however the game isn't about finding all ingredients but only a few in due time, which left me feeling like things were unresolved. The reputation bonuses and penalties around the track felt really too harsh and left all players with a sour taste. Fun, but ridiculously long for what it is.

SUPER difficult to wrap your head around the base concept of deducing ingredients, but once that bit clicks (and it will after a game or two), it's not bad. It smacks slightly of "euro game" with some of the mechanics, that being a plethora of choices but limited resources and time, which means that by the end of the game there will be a laundry list of awesome stuff that you wanted to do but couldn't. And that's anyways something that bothers me in games. But that being said, it's alright.

The most complicated version of Sudoku I have ever played. 

This game seemed to run a bit long because there is a lot to learn and understand.  Overall it didn't seem horrible, but I won't be asking to play it again.

However, if you make a mistake in your record keeping (esp. with the chits) then you are pretty much out of the game because it undermines any logic you apply to deduce something.  If your chits are right, you should be able to accurately rebuild most of your worksheet, but if your chits are wrong, well...  sorry... I hope you enjoy hanging out with us for the next hour.

This game should be required first week of graduate school.

It basically plays like academia, with running experiment, publishing, going to conferences.

That being said, its a lot of work especially if you're a perfectionist and want to get the formulas correct before publishing.

It's pretty involved and takes quite a while to play so set aside at least 2 hours. The app is nifty and the components are beautiful. I think we'll play one or two more times but its not an everyday play kind of game.

The theme is excellent and nicely implemented. The feeling of academic community in general (not only alchemists) is really there and I love that. The competition, the joy of publishing a theory, the even greater wild joy of debunking a theory, the academic pride, the conferences, the eager and not so eager students; It's all there! 

But other than that, "Alchemists" is your typical worker placement game with a deduction element. Although, I have to say that the deduction part is very well crafted and is very appealing to my kids. I also have to note that while the debunking of a theory is very neat when it happens, hardly ever happens.  

My rating reflects my admiration for the implementation of the theme and the extremelly well written rulebook.

BGG Secret Santa gift from the wonderful and overly generous Ann (who I'm still awaiting an Geekmail from!!)

(12/16) 9. Really, really enjoyed my first play of this.  I generally enjoy deduction games and actually won in a four player game where two players had already played before and were almost certainly playing better than me but were unlucky while I fell into a nice engine that pushed me far ahead.

However, even with the victory, I definitely still don't grasp the intricacies of this game yet, and I'm very excited about that.  Looking forward to diving back in soon, though I'm slightly worried by how intimidating this might be for players not already familiar with the game.

Oh, and I LOVE the app aspect of the game.  Very useful and clever.

(10/17) Drop to 8.  A game that I love that feels especially difficult to get to the table given how up-to-your-neck deduction is involved.

This one has a lot going on mechanically, and the board is busy, but the artwork on it is well done, and there's a player screen that gives a great visual appeal.

Really unique game. Not for everyone, however. At its core, this is a deduction game. Everything you do is geared toward deducing the two agents (called alchemicals) that make up each potion. 
I personally like this one a lot, but even I recognize there’s crunchiness here that is both good and bad. I think the alchemical concept could have been done better. If you can’t eventually wrap your brain around it, you’ll probably be too frustrated to appreciate the game’s other shining features, such as the testing on yourself or a student, and the place last, act first worker placement mechanic. 
So this one’s like a Terry Pratchett novel: has a lot of talent in its making, but some people are just not gonna dig it. 
I personally like it very much.

Normally when I don't like the game, I just move on and leave it behind. In this case however I can't.
How can this be, that such a mess is rated SO high. I might don't like all the games from the top of the ranking but it's due to personal preferences. Here however, the game is just weak.
I don't want to write a long rant here, so I'll just highlight the issues.
- Too LONG for what it is - I'm a wargamer who is used to play 12h+ games, but this has to be rewarding time, here it wasn't. Too long for a game of this weight.
- Messy, I'd cut out everything except for really cool potion making.
- The coolest part - the potion making - is suddenly less important for winning than crappy worker placement. When I sat to this game I thought that this is the main focus of the game, sadly no - what wins is workerplacement, artifacts and theories played in most gamey ways.
- Artifacts seem unbalanced.
- In 3+ Players games, there usually is one obvious loser determined around middle of the game. 
- Luck dependent.

Shame, I wanted to like this game, but it turned out a huge disappointment, and now because of its high ranking I will be constantly reminded about it, while I want to forget it.

A very thematic deduction and worker placement game.  I love the deduction aspect, but the designer may have been a bit overly ambitious.  It seems there is a little too much in this game.

Tight worker placement that alllmost gives as much pressure as Dungeon Lords and Agricola (almost). It distracts you by making you solve a Sudoku while playing a WP game with very limited actions. Players will really have to compete in every area and race to publish without making mistakes. Perhaps very slightly too complex than needed but it's fun.

Very unique game, and I've enjoyed my plays.  I'm curious to see how the replayability will be.  I know that the games will technically play out differently, but I wonder whether the rest of the game is interesting enough to keep me intrigued with repeated plays.  I honestly wish the deduction element of the game was heavier than it is...

My one play was moderately fun.  The app works really well.  The deduction burns my brain.  The theme and art are nifty.  I have trouble understanding when some strategic options the game gives you would come into play.

However, it was an immediate purchase because my wife was nuts about it.

Ow my brain. I played a three player game of this that went a little something like this. Hmm this deduction is kinda screwy, oh no, it's cool I've got it, pfft totally solved the ga...OH MY GOD HOW COULD I BE SO WRONG! Which really added to MY enjoyment of the game. The app integration worked well, but it added a lot of extra time to players turns which slowed the game down. Overall I had a really good time with the game in part because of the novelty of the system.

Pros:
Art is VERY good. 
Pieces are plentiful and seem high quality.
Being an Alchemist is FUN! The potion making mechanic is fantastic.

Cons:
The potion making mechanic is a tiny part of a long, slow, boring game.
The turn order and worker placement mechanics are the biggest culprits.
Also, because the winner is decided by victory points (YAWN) and not by potion making, you have to play to earn victory points not to make potions.

Por mi experiencia limitada en este mundo de los juegos de mesa, me costo bastante pillar la mecánica al juego.
El tema de las deducciones es simplemente genial, aunque al principio nos costo bastante asimilarlo.
Puedes diseñar tu estrategia como quieras dedicándote a resolver fórmulas, acumular dinero, refutar o publicar teorías o simplemente entorpecer a todo el que se te ponga por delante.
Mi hija de 7 años, que como se puede suponer en el tema de deducciones no lo puede asimilar, se lo pasa estupendamente creando pociones.
La mayor de 14 esta enganchadísima y le encanta.
La verdad es que al principio no acababamos ni una sola partida, ya que siempre habia alguien que se habia equivocado al tachar las diferentes formulas, pero aun asi y ante mi sorpresa, mis hijas me pedian de nuevo jugar.
Le doy un 10 ya que ha conseguido que toda la familia nos lo pasemos genial.

A game that does so many things right, while mixing it with some completely new and unique features and technologies. Not one game has been played correctly so far, some mistakes are always made in the notebook which detracts from the feeling of completion when you finish the game as it's often hard to figure out where you went wrong.

While playing though, the game is a lot of fun!

Worker placement game where players are trying to create potions. Now, to create those potions they collect ingredients and then use an app to see how those ingredients mix. The answer to the results are a secret, so players keep track of their knowledge to try to figure out the secret to the potions. I liked it, there's a bit of scoring luck in whether players debunk your potions over others. If others score with lucky guesses, etc. Perhaps it takes a few more games for all the players to totally grok it.

My wife loves this game! This is probably the heaviest game that she is willing to play with me as she tends to like cute, lighter games such as Takenoko and Sushi Go! I'm pretty sure its the cat on the box...

I also really like this game, especially the deductive nature of finding the alchemical symbols. The app used with this game is super handy and fun. I also enjoy how much strategy the game offers with worker placement, especially in the later rounds. The game also has a small push-your-luck aspect when testing ingredients on yourself, or when you try to sell a potion off that you're not quite sure is what the buyer is looking for. I've often found that the Debunk Theory spaces are not used often as most players I've played with try to wait until they are sure of the ingredients prior to publishing.

The only thing I don't like about the game is teaching it, especially to people who don't play many heavy board games and can't wrap their heads around how the deduction works. Its a minor set back though, it just means I will only play this game with specific people which really is to be expected for this type of game.

(Based on 1 play with 4 players) A hoot and a holler. Took a beastly long time to set up, explain, and play our first game(3+ hrs), but man it was fun.  It was a lot of fun especially if you get into the role a little bit and act all confident when you publish a theory that's really not ready or correct, or you pretend you're selling battery acid to an adventurer or that you're paralyzed from the waist down because of a potion you drank. Really love how all of each player's research is hidden, and you don't quite know what they're doing.
In all, a blast to play, but maybe too heavy for some.  Will be hard to find times to play this for me and my groups.

Very irritating game. Not enough time to figure out more than one or two combinations unless you are lucky enough to get enough repeats of 'known' ingredient cards. But of course you need those to sell as potions to have enough money to pay for everything. I prefer my games to have less random luck and more chance of skill. And the need to have either a dedicated game DM or a modern phone to run the tests is also irritating.

A beautiful looking game. They took Clue and put it in a cauldron with Agricola, and out popped this game. I liked the deduction and the theorizing/publication.

The deduction puzzle and mobile app at the heart of Alchemists are really excellent, but the worker-placement game makes you feel like you are participating in 2 completely different activities and the scoring system is simply broken: it powerfully disincentives publishing early - which should be the challenge of the game. More than any other game I've played, I want to find a variant or set of house rules that fix the game because the deduction part is so fun & appealing.

Clunky, unpolished, slow, too long, could use streamlining etc. I like the theme, art, components and such but this is just so slow and tedious that I'm afraid I won't be playing this again.

I kind of like that there's no catch-up mechanism in this game but I just can't understand why any modern designer would ever want to include rich-get-richer mechanics in their game. Don't fall back in this game or you'll be facing another 2 hours of zero chance of winning.

The smartphone app makes this a unique game that immediately draws in the newcomers.  Of course non-gamers will quickly realize this isn't an introductory (gateway) game by any means.  There is a lot of chrome (perhaps too much) added on to the basic goal of identifying the alchemicals associated with each ingredient.

I worry that the novelty will eventually wear off, but for the time being I'm having fun showing this off to friends and family.

RATING: 7
FIRST THOUGHTS: I quite like this one, though it feels (in its base form; have only played the expansion once) a little underbaked in spots. If players accidentally stumble in rounds 2-3 on the correct alchemical for several ingredients, the solving portion of the game becomes very dull, and it turns into a worker-placement/optimization game. [This is changed in the expansion of course.] -- This is a game where player count makes a huge difference: in 2-player or 3-player games there is less scrutiny of theories because there are simply fewer eyes on them/cubes for publishing and testing, so the chance of last-minute reversals is much greater; in 4-player games anything erroneous is likely to get debunked quickly. -- That said, it's a fascinating puzzle at times and I like games which reward risky play rather than safe play: taking a chance on selling an unknown potion or publishing an early half-proven theory is often better in the long run than boringly waiting to nail the facts down, and you can also just play to accumulate money and artifacts and swoop in at the end to drop 5- and 3-point ribbons on theories that other players have worked so hard on.

FURTHER THOUGHTS: 2-player is kind of frustrating: given how essential money is in this game, it's vital to claim the Sell Potion spot every round: either sell a potion or offer such a steep discount that the other player has to offer -2 or -3 likewise just to sell one, and then you get a free favour card for your trouble. You can't afford to let the other player sell a potion for 3 or 4 gold (or maybe 5 in later rounds!!). -- So there's a forced move EVERY ROUND which is problematic in terms of game design. Am I missing something? 3-player seems ideal.

Also: one key to playing this game is to watch other players' moves carefully, and hide your own as much as possible. Try to avoid letting people know too much about the cards in your hand (by claiming ingredients via the turn order track or drawing blindly from the deck). Otherwise sharp-eyed players can make free deductions based on observing your actions. (e.g. if you let your hand go down to 1 card, then grab Scorpion and sell a potion successfully, then other players know something about Scorpion without going to the trouble of a test.)

The artifacts are.... interesting. Initially the Boots of Speed, Robe of Respect and Magic Mortar seem terribly overpowered but I've found that on the whole you can win without any of them. Grab them if you can, don't kill yourself if you can't (but don't let someone pig out on artifacts if Crystal Cabinet is coming out later).

MORE THOUGHTS: I play this mostly online; playing it in person, it's clear to me that playing this well requires you to engage as fully with the social deduction game as with the pure deduction game. Track the ingredients players are snapping up, the potions they know how to make, and it's easy to get a ton of information without having to pay for it with ingredients or money or action cubes. Take a spare sheet and in addition to marking down theories, mark down how many ingredients players have at the start and end of rounds--you can then deduce what experiments they are doing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a great heavy euro, with in my opinion the best app integration in board games. The app is not intrusive, easy to use and very intuitive. The game mechanics itself is not heavy, but the combination of the action spaces where you mix the potions and deduction element (finding out which ingredient matches which alchemicals) makes for a very challenging experience. There is an aspect to pushing your luck with the publication actions, but hedging  against the correct colour would be wise.

The only negative I have about the game is maybe the playtime.It is not that we felt that it was too long, but 2 hour games mean it might not get to the table as often. This is also why it is in my opinion best with two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Well, this is an interesting game. The deduction portion is sort of like a "game within the game", as it took some time to understand how that part works separately from the rest of the game itself.

It's a fantastic game. Of course, the deduction is the star of the show. But what makes the game really interesting is attempting to infer information from what your opponents are doing. For example: my wife published a theory on scorpion. How confident am I that she actually knows all 3 ingredients? If I am confident, then I can endorse that theory (for points) and perhaps infer information about other ingredients. But of course, she could publish a theory where she only knows 2 of the 3 ingredients, knowing that may cause me to make an incorrect reference if I believe she actually knows all 3. So while the interaction in the game is indirect, it's always present and something one needs to think about.

RATING: 8.2
What a game! There are two parts to this game: the Mastermind style puzzle and the Worker Placement actions. Both parts mesh together really well giving the feel of a single gaming experience.
After a false start where I had misplaced a token on my board and then re-starting the game, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that you need to play this in a relaxed manner where if someone says they need 5 minutes to consider their next move, then let them. Trying to hurry the game along will ruin it. That said the 2 player game ran in around 2.5 hours.
My concern with the game is that if you make a mistake with deductions, you can start with a new sheet and rework all your logic, but if you put a token in the wrong position it is unrecoverable. So place carefully!
Great game, and I am looking forward to my next session.
After playing a 3 player game where someone misplaced a token and trashed their game....the warning is all the more important.

What a game! Every time I have opened this game I have had so much fun. From the absolutely sheer terror of finding out that mixing a crow's foot and a cane toad together creates a potion showing an aspect you already knew. To the thrill of disproving your friends published work exposing him/her as the fraud you know them to be.

This game creates tension though publishing academic works first, proving that you're the smartest alchemist in your gaming group. High risks have high rewards but even higher penalties. Being the smartest alchemist makes more, earns greater reputation and generally makes you look pretty tough among your peers. However errors are penalized at a greater extent, scrutiny and pressure bare down upon you as you try and impress your peers at the exhibition. Overall this is a delightful puzzle game with enough competition to get my laziest friend off the couch and joining our gaming group.

I know this is a better game than I rated it, but after my first play it just didn't quite click with me.  Part of my problem being that I didn't fully understand the deduction mechanisms.  Definitely would be willing to try again, and I'm pretty sure my rating would go up, if I had a better idea of how to take notes and make use of them.
The app (Android/iOS/PC) works quite well.  One thing I am certain of, is this is a game I don't need to own.

Truly innovative game. One of the best of the last Essen (2014). The smartphone application not only doesn't complicate things, but it adds to the game atmosphere and mechanics. Great game on any aspect. Perfect as a deduction, smart and thematic as a worker placement. I want mooooore plays...!!!

Excellent blend of mechanics rooted in an fantastic deduction system. The gameplay feels mostly familiar, but the deduction element introduces a fresh twist. Learning the deduction seems tricky at first, but it isn't too bad once you get the hang of it. Extremely innovative with the companion app.

This game has got mixed reviews but the mechanisms of deduction, bluffing and building on hidden information did appeal to me. The deduction game is simple once you understand how it works - simply mix ingredients to find their common elements until you're ready to deduce their composition. However, game is not only about mixing and deducing but rather about knowing when to take which actions to be ahead of the other players. This is particularly true when it comes to publishing your findings, where you can bluff and then debunk your own theory to earn reputation and, more importantly, confuse your opponents.

There are some aspects that concern me, like the lack of a rubber band mechanism, some potentially over-powered artefacts and an anticlimactic last round when (as it happened in my game at least) all compositions are known and the rest of the game is about maximizing points. It may also be too long for a game with so many random elements. Nevertheless, the game experience is fun and that's what counts!

The most innovative deduction game until now. Very cool components, a very good production and a very helpfull and good application that is important for the game to play. As for the gameplay, it has very nice mechanisms of worker placement and some bluffing but the game is actually all about deduction. It has a very reasonable way to find the structure of every element and the way they are excluded every time you find something new. It is all together a great game and it is a must have for deduction fans. A beatiful job for a new come designer.

At this point I've watched a LOT of videos about this game and despite my reservations about the need for a SmartPhone app I am relatively keen to have this one. Not only are the theme and the production exceptional, but the combination of a logic deduction and work placement game is hugely appealing.

I love the unique theme, and the theme is strong. The art and pieces are of good quality. With such few rounds to figure out the chemical components, a good strategy is key. However, it is a rather lengthy game and takes some thought and a little luck.

Alchemists is a game where you use deduction skills to reason out the base ingredients of the games universe. With a hint of worker placement to give you slight advantages in certain areas over your opponents. Game is enjoyable and like it when we have 2 hour blocks open to try and whip this game out.

The three-way balancing act between gambling, bluffing and information-gathering is the real hook of the game. Emergent gameplay seeps through every design choice, and the game is definitely not centered around deduction at the expense of other fun factors. One round you feel like being at a casino at Las Vegas, and the next round you feel like a mathematician in a chemistry laboratory -- but not at the game's mercy, but rather through your free will to choose. The 'crazy world of academia'-theme is very funny and realistic. I'd say that the thematic immersion is some of the best I've experienced (and I'm in academia in real life): the players really become one with their characters (more than mere role play) and get sucked into the twisted psychology of this universe. Components are beautiful, the elegant app works like a dream (and adds to immersion even more) and game length is perfectly optimized to tell a story of many surprise moments and surprise discoveries, from zero knowledge to complete mastery. Artwork and components are the best imaginable (except for color misalignment on the deduction board). The design is like an elegant mathematical proof crossbred with a street magic trick. Playing this game feels like living in a fairy tale and truly becoming part of it. Where else can you publish nonsensical theories, get fame for it, spend the money greedily, plan to debunk your own theory and then race with others to do it, guess in advance how a theory will be debunked when first 'supporting it' etc.? It is marvellous and a lot more intuitive than it sounds. Exciting times are guaranteed.

Really enjoyed this game and its use of deduction.  I really liked the gameplay and did not find the learning curve to be a harsh as I have heard from others.  However, I wonder about the game's shelf life.  It feels like once you come up with a strong method to determine the chemical aspects of each ingredient, the game will just become repetitive and luck dependent.  Time will tell.

I like this game just fine but it can grind to a halt if players get too invested in their own deductions. I generally prefer the game with two players because of that and I absolutely would not play it with more than three. The deduction is star of the show. Everything else is so-so at best but I do like that the game gives the opportunity to score some points based on the deduction of others through the endorsement mechanism. It's a fine game but it runs way to long when players get into their own personal sudoko puzzles. Definitely not for players that dislike multiplayer solitare style euro-games.

RATING: 7.7
A disappointment only because I expected more. A simple worker placement combined with simple logic deduction.

Most of the time you are just crossing alchemicals off a chart, there isn't any logic deduction to it. There are a few leaps you must make with logic deduction, such as with neutral potions, but even these are simple after playing a few times.

Overall a wonderful game and lots of fun, I was just hoping for more of a logical thinker.

This game is good to play once every 3 months or so, but by then I've forgotten the rules.

I will almost always pull another game out first.

Played a late stage prototype.  The concept and implementation with the app is brilliant, hands down.

It loses points for me because the marriage of logic puzzle with highly interactive worker placement strategy will naturally lend itself to significant analysis paralysis, and is not really avoidable if you want to play well.  A secondary concern is a fair amount of luck in what you can learn.  You are limited to learning about the aspects of the cards you have drawn, which won't always match up with what you would actually like to know.

Definitely try it for yourself - the experience is like no other game out there.  But for me it is a miss for the above reasons.

Diversity - this is what this game brings to the table. The rules are simple, albeit bearing a fairly complicated concept to grok, and the artwork is laugh-inducing. I have fun each time I play, always worried and laughing about how many deduction and connection mistakes my friends and I will make in one match. The great concept, however, is also its weakness: after a while, you just feel like you're playing a one never-ending, big game. Play it moderately and be always happy about it.

Love the central deduction piece, but there's a bit too much fluff around it. If it could be winnowed to remove the need for money and the favor cards (thus removing the imbalancing aspects), it might play more quickly and be a Clue killer. Still a great game -- for the central deduction concept -- but the extra-ness of it is a turn off.
-----
There's just way too much bloat, and too much that hinges on guesses. To illustrate the latter: I could spend my first turn narrowing down an ingredient to one of two alchemicals. On the second turn, publish a theory about the ingredient, making a 50/50 guess. Now, do I hedge my bet with 100% safety, or go for the points? What I do here is a game-deciding move, so early on. If I am wrong, then hedging my bet provides 3 rewards -- I can debunk my own theory in the 3rd round for 2 points, I won't lose points in doing so, and I can re-publish the correct theory and get 5 points from it. OTOH, if I am right, then I must bet 5 points on the theory, or else not derive any gain from my research at the end of the game.  What a stupid non-dilemma. There's no strategy in the decision, just a wild guess. Or is the strategy to purposely publish the wrong theory and pursue avenue 1? Downgrading from 6.5.

Hard to explain well but addictive as can be, Alchemists mashes up worker-placement with old-school LOGIC PUZZLES and wraps it in a parody of Ivory Tower academic publishing.  Absolutely insane in scope.  Plays fast (once people know the rules).  And the public “oops” moments make for a fun group experience.

This is not for everyone, but if you’re a logic puzzle fan you NEED to try it.

The art, CGE style, is very cool and the design is not great, but attractive for sure. The manual is fun and didactic, CGE style as well,.

The deduction part is not complicated, but at least is more complex than anything I have seen so far in boardgames. I guess this is so because otherwise, it could create huge differences between players. But the deduction is only a part of the game. The worker placement part is also very important. It starts with the initiative system from Fresco and takes it to another level creating an order of resolution in the actions themselves; this way, you might get penalized for not being first or even some action could become speculative.

The game is thinky (especially until you master the deduction part), but interesting and fun.

My biggest issue is that I have serious concerns about the replayability. The game works very well, and I'm sure it will keep working well forever, the games will be different, but once the deduction part becomes natural and effortless, I might not want to pay it again (or yes, who knows).

I'm not convinced by the refutation mechanic. Once the game is advances, it's very difficult to find the coloured tile you want, it will probably have been used for another element, and you night not have enough information to refute it.


Still, right now it's a breeze of fresh air in my boardgaming life.

So far, the best deduction game I've seen!

RATING: 4
Strong contender for Worst Usability of the Year. Microscopic icons, half of which have insufficient contrast. Tiny text on cards. Inefficient board layout. All of which does not really matter since you can't even see the board from behind the massive player screen. The potion counters do not fit in their respective holes in the player screen, and the card holder is almost equally as fiddly. Can't really be played without smartphones, preferably one for each player. Still uses the bloatware approach to rulebook writing, with essential tiny rules hidden in weird places within giant walls of text; They really should outsource their rulebook writing. 

All of this might be tolerable if the game was actually interesting or fun to play; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.

Long, but I do enjoy it. Cool mix of deduction, worker placement, and more. The theme really works. NOT for non-gamers.

But, I do think there's a bit too much in there, and the icons etc. do not make it easy to remember all the rules. I wish it were just a bit more streamlined and intuitive, because I really do like the deduction aspects and the app. Might be better as a video game!

RATING: 10
I usually do enjoy logic puzzles and there are already a couple of games that use them as a game. This is however the first one where it feels to me like the puzzle is really integrated into an overall game and it's not just a puzzle with some sot of scoring added on top. 

In addition to this the theme is just what makes me really love this game. I work in research and so many of the mechanics just deal with this in a very ironic and almost satirical way, which gives it this additional charming thematic flavor. 

I guess for many people downtime can get a problem here (especially when people take a while to scan their cards), but to me it's just one of the games where I know it can take a little longer and if I'm up for this type of game, I don't mind it at all. It's just a game, where I'm aware it has this big logic puzzle and thinking about my own experiments, what I can deduce from them, which experiments I should do next, which theories of others I might be able to prove wrong, gives me enough to think about, while it's not my turn that I don't feel bored during downtime. 

And of course a comment on the app: I was actually more sceptical about it than excited at first and what draw me to the game was more the theme than the app. But I do think it is well integrated here. It's not just a gimmick but really makes the gameplay possible smoothly without needing a gamemaster and there is enough going on on the board and with the cards, cubes, tiles etc. that it doesn't reduce the feel of a boardgame for me. 

So overall really great game.

Mi hijo (de 12 años) es un gran fan de este juego, incluso siendo que aun no es capaz de manejar correctamente todo el proceso de pensamiento lógico que el juego conlleva.
Yo, por otra parte, no estoy tan interesada en el juego como él. Este es un juego apropiado para jugadores "avanzados" o al menos experimentados, ya que la complejidad de sus reglas extiende en hasta 3 horas su aprendizaje. Dicho esto, creo que cuando jugamos las rondas del juego se me hicieron pocas, y cuando estaba finalmente encontrando las pistas (esto depende mucho de las cartas que robes) el juego se terminó!  
Fue un sabor amargo el que me dejó, luego de 3 horas de juego, el no haber tenido forma de recuperarme de una mala decision tomada al comienzo.
No creo que vuelva a jugar esto de nuevo, pero por alguna razón parece ser un juego tipo Lo Amo/Lo Odio, y yo definitivamente No lo Amo.
----------
My son (12 years old) it's a great fan of this game, even though he can not yet manage correctly all the logic thinking involved in it. 
I, on the other hand, am not as keen as him towards it. I must say this is a game for advanced or at least experimented board gamers only, as it has a complexity of rules that can take you up to 3 hours to just pick up the game play. With that said, I thought I was left with very short amount of opportunities in it's rounds and when I finally was picking up the clues (as it will depend a lot on the card drawing) the game ended! It is a bitter taste you're left with when you've spend 3 hours trying to do something and because of one bad decision you are helpless and unable to pick yourself up.
I don't think I'll be playing this again, but for some reason this is a LOVE IT/ HATE IT kind of game and I'm definitely not on the Love-it side.

Such an innovative game. Can seem somewhat fiddly the first few times you play it. But third go around really starts to shine. Hoping that the constant consulting of the rulebook diminishes and game speed picks up. But just love the theme of passive-agressive academics sniping each other. The game board art is really capitvating. It has that Vlaada Chvatil style rulebook with humorous asides. Some people get annoyed by these and I do agree from a quick reference standpoint the narrative style can be a bear. However the flavor text is in italics and can be safely ignored but I wouldnt. It actually is a great teaching aide by really infusing the rules with theme. For example you can test your potions on students. The first time someone poisons the student with a negative potion in the round his enthusiam for science greatly diminishes, you now have to pay him 1 gold to for him to agree to remain your
 guinea pig. If the rule was delivered in a dry no nonsense matter sure its easier to lookup later but I argue because of the fun and thematic flavor text you will never forget the rule in the first place.

RATING: 7.5
Nice game, with very simple deduction (almost a sudoku type puzzle). It is more about misleading others and planning the workerplacement piece. The deduction puzzle itself is easy and not adding too much value. The mobile app is fun, but distracting sometimes and a little a hassle too.

Alchemists is one of the first app-integrated games, which makes potion-making easier for everyone. And the game is atmospheric and gorgeous to look at, too. It's one of those perfect games where theme meets mechanics effortlessly. The basic concept of the game is Clue with worker placement: there are eight mysterious ingredients with magical properties to be solved by the end of the game. Players gather then mix the ingredients to make potions with positive or negative effects. With the results, players can then trace back which properties belong to which ingredients. But don't be tricked into thinking that you automatically win by solving all eight ingredients; it's just a distraction. The reality is that the player who best utilizes their limited but correct information about some of the ingredients is the winner, by making a claim on a particular ingredient, endorsing another player's claim or debunking false claims. At it's heart, Alchemists is a victory-point-driven Euro with inventive mechanics and it's balanced for different strategies. The board, components, and overall design of the game are beautiful but set-up and teaching can be a bear. Luckily, turns flow nicely and are intuitive. Don't be fooled by the box art and cute rules! There is a lot of strategy in Alchemists!

This game will appeal to all those smart phone addicts out there, the ones you see forever texting with silly grins on their face, imagine sitting around the game table with those kind of people , there are enough addicts out there to make this game a success but i prefer the traditional board games with a bit of interaction as far as i'm concerned board games and apps dont go together let's hope this is not a sign of things to come.

Wow this game is immense fun! But be wary of teaching this to non-gamers and be ready for a long explanation process as there are two parts to teaching 1: How the alchemist process works and 2: the Worker Assignment/game board part. I would highly recommend devoting time to let the new players test and experiment with the Alchemy process before teaching and playing the rest of the game. You really need to have the alchemy process down in order to understand the decisions you are making in the game when it comes to the worker placement section of the game. This is very tight, extremely balanced, well made and produce game!

High learning curve. Nice theme but takes a lot of time to figure out on the 8x8 grid with all these  plusses and mins  if you want to do a move. Espescially when searching for a result. Don't Like market system at all. First you need to bid on place and then you must bid again with the risk to gain almost nothing. Theorie board is ok. Artifacts is the way to go for points besides theorie board. They could have left this out. Testing potions on yourself is a huge risk.

A pioneer of using an smart phone app to play the game. At it's heart it is a deduction game with a worker placement system. The deductions are essential but need to be coupled with a good strategy as you win by scoring reputation points rather than mastering all the elements.

First of all, let me say that the rule book didn't make this easy.  I am sure that on the first play we missed a few things.  There is a lot going on in this game, and there is no doubt that subsequent plays will be easier simply because of the learning curve.

Second, the integration with the app is a pretty cool feature.  

Third, the deductive nature of the game seems to be fairly straightforward.  On our first play, we were all too tentative to bluff or to challenge others for bluffing, and I misread my own notes to where I thought someone else was bluffing only to discover I agreed with them completely.  We did not race to publish, and I am sure that once you see the need to do so, it gives the game an extra dynamic.

When our game ended, I really wanted to set it up and play again immediately, but did not have the time to do so.

Very solid worker placement game with deductive elements.  Throw in the clever use of a smartphone app to streamline the game, and the quality is quite high.  The publishing/debunking mechanism is really interesting, particularly when you figure out you need to debunk one of your own theories to replace it with a correct one.

The fact that the rules provides for two different levels of play (Apprentice/Master) should broaden the game's appeal, although I've never played the Apprentice game so I wouldn't be able to state how significantly is changes things.

The deduction part is innovative and good.
It just didn't convince me to have a heavy deduction mechanic combined with a workerplacement mechanic. I still give it a solid 7.

Although most people will focus solely on deduction element of the game, it is just one aspect of the game. Worker placement element is very demanding because there are so few rounds in the game and so much choices.
Currently I feel that with time, I will rate this game lower. Although I like punishing games that sanction one's mistakes, it is really hard to come back from mistakes in Alhemists. Therefore, very rarely the game and score is tight and mostly one player runs away with it with some margin.

Alchemists is a competitive deduction game in which players are trying to figure out the composition of various alchemical elements based on the effects they produce when mixed together. The game uses a mobile app to randomize the setup and administrate the game (alternatively, a non-playing person can do this). Combined elements (called “potions”) can be tested on students (who may charge you), yourself (which may have very adverse effects), or customers (who cost more action points and may either give you money or cost you points). Either way, the resultant potion will have a color and a sign, which can be marked in your screen. Once you have enough information about a given element, you can choose to publish your findings for victory points. There are incentives to publish before your information is complete, but if you’re wrong then other players can choose to debunk your research which gives them points and costs you points. On top of this game lies an action selection system that’s very reminiscent of Dungeon Lords or Dungeon Petz. I enjoyed the deduction elements of this game, but some of the chrome didn’t sit well with me--the publishing system had a “get there first” kind of feel, and action selection mechanism seemed a little overwrought and fiddly.

Quite the interesting game. It's part deduction and part worker placement. I do find the worker placement probably the weakest part of the game, but the deduction is quite fun. The worker placement part of the game just felt slow and a bit strange at times. Almost clunky.

The rulebook was both amazingly wonderful and horrible at the same time. I found a lot of useful information in learning the alchemical properties and deducing things, but a few spots the rules seem quite vague. The first game also blew my mind in terms of trying to solve things. I think I have a pretty good grasp of it now and I'm still quite enthralled with it. I fucked up big time my first game in crossing off things and we ended up with only partially correct theories. 

A solid deduction game even if it's a bit slow in spots.

Side note, but I was [i]this[/i] close to tearing one of the cauldron shelves off. I mangled the red one slightly thinking that I was supposed to be punching it out and had a shitty cut. The rules don't mention this anywhere and I was glad I stopped where I did.

[b]Update[/b]: I worry that I might be too good at this game. I was able to solve most of the alchemical properties within the first few turns and if my opposing player was correct, I was able to knock them all down to correct answers within those few turns. Not sure what I can do to hinder that. I suppose I did get slightly "lucky" with testing a few potions on myself, but more often than not, I was able to reduce down things fairly easily. Still a fun game, but I'm worried that I'll crush a new player.

I'm also unsure of how better to publish theories. I was correct early and often and I had no issue hedging bets against one that I thought might be wrong or I knew was wrong only to debunk it and republish it later. I wonder if more players will force me to strategize differently, so I look forward to a 3 or 4 player game.

A [b]heavy[/b] deduction game, worker-placement in its heart. It's revolutionary for its (almost mandatory) digital aid and would appeal to people that like deducing information based on partial information of their own and partial information given by others, voluntary or not. It's very AP-prone though and would take more than 3 hours with slow players.

I feel like this game attempts to do a lot of things all at once and kind of steps on its own toes with some of its major design elements.  The game puts on itself a turn limit based around there is only so many turns one would need to figure out which ingredient does what and with that limited time limit it sets on itself it kills some of the viability of separate strategies one may have in this game.
  
It has the makings of a really good game, but items and/or money in general needs to be worth more or there needs to be more of a reward for using the market or selling potions for it to be worth not finding out more information about the ingredients which ultimately leads to winning the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is great! The logic puzzle is a hurdle to most people looking into it, but that is really just a smaller component of the game. The real meat is the crunch of 6 rounds and which actions to take. Alchemists is a joy to play now-and-then. Eventually I want to buy special velvet bags and cool token holders and everything to really bedazzle my copy.

My only issue is just how it takes a long time, and there is downtime when you have to deduce things and make decisions. I am pretty patient though so this is fine. You couldn't have this great game without the downtime.

Some day eventually, after I've mastered Master mode, I definitely want to try the King's Golem expansion!

I like the core deduction mechanic, and the 'race' makes it interesting. But the worker placement stuff really ruins it: there's too few rounds, too little money, too few potions being made, pointless items, random ingredients etc. In general, too many rules and regulations from what could be a relatively simple competitive deduction game.

If they got rid or completely redesigned most of the worker placement aspect it might be a good game.

Great theme and gameplay. The player interactions, the way you analyze the plays your opponents do, the way you deduce the potions that you have created, sold, and tested, everything about this game, I love. 

It doesn't help that I'm a sucker for the fantasy genre. Even though it's a bit of a long side when trying to explain new players, once the mechanics of the game kick in, it just clicks with them.

Great, great game.

One of my top 5 board games that I like  a lot. 

I really like eveything in this: the theme, the complexity, the artwork, the components. 

A hard game that need knowledge of logic and deduction, obviously, it's really don't necessary but they simplifies many things. 

A long game the firsts time you play it (like many euros) but with many game it's going to be easy and short.

The use of an app in this game blowed up my mind the first time LOL. That was really cool, I've never seen something like that before. 

PD. Sometimes you will feel some cards are needed in the game (different that the ones in the game) and some of them unbalanced the game but it's ok.

This is a deduction game that uses an app to randomize the answers you are looking for with each play. It's an interesting idea, and I didn't mind the app being part of the game design. The issue I had was that the game, outside of the goal of deducing the potion results is very finicky with a lot to remember. There's not much time or ability to deduce, and the things that punish you most are like, you forgot you needed 1 gold, or you forgot you needed a worker in two different spots to do this action/combo thing. 

There is also some "double dick-punching", where if you publish something wrong, which you have to do unless you are nuts lucky, then someone can knock you off, and you lose a ton of points, and THEN take more damage from a round event that hurts you if you don't have X published theories. 

I liked the deduction part, but by the end the other rules frazzled me that I mixed a invalid potion that I already knew how to make because I got the ingredient colors messed up. I had set the correct cards I needed to mix the potion in front of me so I wouldn't forget, and then pulled two wrong cards from my hand to make the potion and failed. This of course isn't the game's fault, but my point is just that the game requires you to remember a lot of stuff that isn't related to the deduction part of the game... and the deduction part of the game, you actually barely make progress on because of lack of available actions and a lot of dependency on luck.

I played this at DGM the week before BGG.CON and then again at BGG.CON. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Solving the logic puzzle was a lot of fun for me: I did a lot of logic puzzles as a kid. But it had a really neat game around that: in both games, the winner was NOT the same person who knew the most about the puzzle. I was really engaged in both games, and I could hardly believe how much time had passed. I would gladly play this again any time.

(The app integration is superb, and it's really got me thinking about how I could use an app in a game design.)

Szóval kiemelkedő darabról beszélünk és, ami tuti, hogy játsszuk még mostanában, hogy belejöjjünk kellőképp a - sokszor túlzottan túlbonyolított - szabályokba.(pl.: az eladás, garancia és a kedvezményadás.)
De leszögezhető, hogy olvasva durvább, mint játszva. :)
Gyors update: másodjára még jobb, de még kaotikusabb. Meg kell találni, érteni a következtetéseket, mert ha hibát követ el az ember vége, belekeveredik és annyi. Mint ma én!:)

I enjoyed the parts of this game but on the whole there are some issues that make it more frustrating than fun.  The deduction aspect can be swingy - some players may get much more information than others by performing the same amount of tests.  There is a lot of "push your luck" on the board that is also very swingy.  If things go your way you can run away with the game; if they don't, or if you play it safe, you may find yourself struggling to catch up.

This game is brilliant for people who like deduction mechanism. Although the quality of the components is not the best, the price is also very cheap compared to most board games with this level of content.

RATING: 6
Pros:
1. Worker placement deduction game.
2. Interesting way to score points. Competing over publishing and capitalizing on other player's mistakes is fun.
3. Every game can be a little different to the variability that using an app adds.

Cons:
1. The app is both a pro and a con. I like the variability it adds, but it is annoying to have to have your cell phone out and to download an app. 
2. Nothing revolutionary about this game. Using an app increases variability, but I wouldn't call it a game changer.

Summary: Solid and fun game. Willing to play again, but not likely to purchase myself.

The deduction puzzle that's central to this game is absolutely fantastic, and I love the mad scramble towards publishing one's theories - often having to make the terrible decision between expediency or accuracy.

However, the euro part of this euro game is lacking.  The worker placement element is clunky and unintuitive, which when combined with inconsistent iconography and a visually noisy game board makes the game a bear to teach. 
Also, I feel that having the availability of basic resources be random in a competitive logic puzzle is poor design.

If Alchemists received a second edition that streamlined its iconography and board mechanics, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

The first play of this was mind boggling, but once it clicks Alchemists is full lf puzzley goodness, and really isn't as taxing as it orginally seems. More pattern recoginition than brain burn. A little bit of push your luck involved in racing the other opponents to publish first means the game will never have the problem of being "solved". In the end, this was a real winner, and a great unique game to squeeze into my collection.

RATING: 10
My current addiction, it's such a fun and satisfying game. The deduction becomes straightforward after a few games but that just opens you up to the capacity for inference. Red picked up a toad, did he use it this turn? Did he use two toads? Is he holding it to mess with you? Green says mushroom is +++, do you trust her enough to use that information in your grid? 

The worker placement component is IMO as robust as any other non-Uwe game. I have to put my cubes down before Blue, will he snatch that sweet item I want? Will he debunk Red's preposterous theory of fern before I get a chance to rub his nose in it? 

I've seen some people complain that there aren't enough actions. Your opponents don't have enough to do everything they want either. Scarcity creates tension. You don't need to prove and publish every theory on the board, you just need to score more points than the second-rate scholars across the table.

This game is too complicated for what it is. You feel action starved the entire game. The fun parts of the game are overshadowed by complications. I had really high hopes for this game, which might be why I'm so down on it.

I feel this game would be 200% better if it only had the Forage, Artifact and Experiments actions (with minor adjustments to how you gain gold).  This would give you no complications with all the deduction and fun.

Very excellent executed mix of decuction, worker placement and also a bit of push-your-luck (publishing theories on which you are unsure). Teh app integration is very good and is just a little tool and not the main aspect of the game (it totally feels like a board game, not a video game). It is a bit luck dependend, but I actually enjoy that. I love the theme and the illustrations. Some of the artifacts feel a bit unbalanced to me (boots and mortar), so I play with other artifacts.

The Golem expansion is extremely good, but also turns this game into quite a heavy beast. It adds basically two dimensions to the deduction, but also has only some smaller modules which you could add independently from on another, if you only want to add a little to the base game.

When you understand the deduction......, the game is more or less broken in a 2 or 3 player game....!! Everybody plays on save, so no use of debunking!! No one ever tests potions on themselves, useless action space!  Only diff is who takes the best favor cards or the best artifact, and that's the winner! 

it is a pitty! The art is awesome and also the theme is great!

7.1 after first play. Felt different from anything else we have.


7.4. After 3 plays.  There are two games here, one is the deduction race to determine what components make up each ingredient (or sudoku on steroids as one friend commented).  The other is the worker placement aspect, which has a touch of fresco about it.  The random draw of the 8 ingredients can reduce the options you wanted to take.  
Artifacts can provide an element of interaction.

why this is in my collection
A competitive deduction game.

This was one of the Essen releases I was most looking forward to. A year later, and I've still only played twice so far, once 2p against my wife and once 3p - the other player in that 3p game didn't seem to really "get" the game or enjoy it, which I think is the main reason that we've not played since.

To be honest I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as I expected, but I can still see plenty to like in the game, and I'm still keen to play again. I'm particularly intrigued by the deduction elements alongside the fact that you are encouraged to "publish" when you may not yet be sure of the theory you are publishing, which opens up plenty of opportunities for interesting play. Definitely a game I feel I need to explore more.

RATING: 8.3
(+) Immersive theme: this game truly feeds your hunger for experiment and discovery

(+) Exciting boardgame experience: it has every player involved from the first minute to the last

(+) Beautiful artwork: the game looks and feels fantastic

(+) Familiar game mechanics drive the core of the game, but they are presented in such a way, intertwined with deduction aspects to make for a very original game experience

(+) Humor, always a big plus

(+) Very reasonable game time, little downtime, smooth game flow

(+) An additional plus because the game made me feel 'happy' for a number of non-specific reasons :) It is such a cute and charming game!

(-) Some luck dependence with early experiments. You want to make sure to get some insight into blue, green and red aspects as soon as possible and in the beginning of the game you will have to realize this with trial and error. Such luck-dependence usually puts me off, but in the case of Alchemists I can easily put this aside as those early 'trial and error' experiments are fun to carry out and fit the theme of the game perfectly. Furthermore, luck dependence creeps into the core of this game as it is all about taking (really thouroughly calculated!) chances. Furthermore, some luck dependence which can not be mitigated enters play with some artefact cards, drawing favor cards and obtaining the right ingredients (limited open card row).

(-) Quality of components is actually rather good: thick cardboard, beautiful artwork, very sound and beautiful player screens. However, I 'm not sure how many game sessions they might last: the way the player screens fold kind of freaks me out, I'm not sure how long the result-tokens will last taking into account you need to punch them in and out of your triangles each time and they only delivered a notebook for 25 4p-game sessions...
-> CGE has put a webform on their website with information on how to obtain 2nd print result markers which fit the deduction triangle better. More info over [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1254086/problem-counters]here[/url].

Tips:
(*) An early publish of a wrong theory is risky, certainly in the apprentice variant. If others have already experimented with that component and they have knowledgde of an aspect of which you are unsure, chances are big that your theory will get debunked in one or two rounds. Don't waste your action and money on an early publish unless you can use it to snatch away a scholarship.
(*) It's easy to go low on money in the game. It is difficult to obtain money. (selling requires the right ingredients, preferably a place early in turn order and 2 action cubes!). You need money in order to publish theories (and you will need more money of you publish later than necessary) and if you want to buy artefacts.
(*) So far we have only played the apprentice variant. I think the master variant will be much better, giving a better dynamic of the debunking action.

I fell in love with this game when I tried it at a friend's house. It´s a game with a beautiful graphic art, I like a lot its  illustrations. All the different components of the game are superb, with a high quality material, and everything at a good price. Mechanics of the game work, adapted to its theme, in an perfect way. Without a doubt, it´s one of the best games I have in my collection, and both my wife and me love it! I remember that, at first glance, I wasn´t convinced about its digital application but, once tested, it´s a great success, and it´s implemented in the core of the game in a great way (it isn´t the protagonist: it´s just a little part of the whole). Definitely, an original, difficult (to learn), and outstanding game.

05-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Relatively heavy eurogame which combines worker placement with a deduction element. 

In Alchemists you are trying to correctly mix potentions and determine which ingredients can be combined to make a positive, negative or neutral potion. Then, you try to earn points by making potions and positing scientific theories on the polarity of the ingredients. This part of the games uses worker placement.

We played using a misprinted Essen copy, but otherwise the components were fine. One 'geekrage' eliciting aspect of the game is that an APP is used to determine which the configurations of ingredients are. To me, that's no issue and if you find someone willing they made a cardboard version who a dedicated non-player can be used to replace the app.

The app implementation with visual card recognition is very well done.  Unfortunately, it's not a good deduction game if that's what you're looking for.  The deduction part is very simple and easily solved if you invest your time in testing, but the game is really won on establishing hedged guesses early, endorsing others, and being most efficient with your action cubes in converting them to VPs (with gaining ingredients and testing being generally an inefficient path to VP).  Unfortunately, the hedging isn't that interesting either; since hedging wrong is a significant VP loss, you're only going to do it when you're confident it won't be wrong (you know 2 alchemicals and just unsure about the third).  This is very different than the feeling of risk in Mystery of the Abbey where you may risk declaring a prophecy when you are just playing the odds hoping that the murderer is fat or bearded for example.  Personally, I just wish the game had been much more difficult in the deduction part (more ingredients, more complex interactions between ingredients, mixing of 3 or more,...) and had more development in the types of testing (different students you can test on, carryover effects on students positive or negative from previous rounds, drinking a good potion yourself giving you a bonus, instead of selling a potion for gold there are a variety of different wizards that appear each round that will answer different types of questions about the ingredients Sleuth-style, just to name some random ideas) and really centered around testing and deduction.  I really wanted there to be more meaningful ways to gain information from the results of other players' testing/questioning.  And the different + potions have names (IIRC speed, power, and ....) but these have no relevance at all to the game!  I want the potions to be cool and meaningful.

Oh, and I like the Fresco-like selection of a wake-up time for turn order, but unlike Fresco where this interacts with the tension of trying to second guess where other players are going to place workers, this has a weird theme-disconnect where the player waking up latest places his worker cubes on the board first, but those workers will activate last, so the other players can easily just block that player by going before them, but the late riser's first worker gets to go before the early riser's second worker, and selling a potion turn order doesn't matter as much because you're all going to bid for the highest discount, and.... it just is a real mess thematically and using secret simultaneous cube placement like in Fresco I think would have been a great idea and much faster.

This one is a very heavy Euro with a good 120 minute investment required. That being said, it is a very original and unique game, that mixes really cool worker placement mechanics with a deduction element. What's especially good about the game is that it rewards different styles of play.

RATING: 9
The first time I played this game, my brain nearly melted. I had to ask how deduction worked over and over again. Nevertheless, I was completely enamoured with Alchemists.

App implementation is brilliant, it's neither a gimmick, nor is it distracting you from the essence of gameplay. Without the app, this game would not be possible (even though the rules give you an alternative in which [-]your worst enemy[/-] a non-playing friend can take on the role of the app.

The deduction feels like a sudoku puzzle. The first few games, the thrill of deducing as much about as many ingredients as possible matters more than scoring points. The action selection/worker placement is great, you'll always wish for just one more action. And failing at the deduction doesn't mean you don't stand a chance at winning the game. There's many ways to score points, even when you have limited knowledge about the ingredients. Each time you play, you notice you've done better than the previous time you played.

Oh, and the artwork is great too. I can't help but think about Unseen University from Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, when I look at it.

Experienced players do have an edge over newbies, though. But the aforementioned fun of deducing the elements will matter more to new players than actually winning the game. I recommend new players start out in a 2-player game, as you'll have more actions and thus errors are less punishing.

But all things considered: I love this game!

There may be other games which rival it in coolness of theme, but I don't think any game achieves the marriage of theme and mechanics so well as Alchemists. I love that when I say things like "I'm not sure whether I want to publish this theory based on only one experiment and the as-yet unproved research of my opponent", I am describing exactly what is going on both in theme and mechanically

The game runs so well, and the deduction in the game is an ingenious design. It's a fantastic feeling when you take two ingredients which you have never mixed before, yet you are able to predict the result based on the relationships to other ingredients you have worked with. The worker placement aspect of the game is fine, and is a good enough backdrop for the superb systems for which it serves as a backdrop.

This game made fun! Rather innovative mechanisms, especially the app-driven chemistric mixery part. Artwork and parodistic theme are typical for a CGE game and could have been a product of Vlaada Chvátil. The "Clue" style however can ruin one's results for several or all potions if you make one little mistake ... like I did in my first game: I mixed up two lines and everything was faulty in the end.

A great way to add a logic puzzle to a worker placement game. You really have to like logic puzzles to enjoy, and even understand, this game. Once you solve the puzzle, I'm not sure there is much replayability left; but we haven't tried the master version yet!

This game ticks so many boxes for me. I love the almost sudoku like puzzle to figure out the components, and the app is really wonderful. There's also a lot to this game.

Growing up one of my favorite games was Clue. I loved the deduction element, and I really enjoyed trying to use what I could infer the other players know to make my own guesses better. There is a lot of that in this game. This game is also one of those rare games where the game experience transcends the competitive nature. While I like to win, I do not care if I won by the end. If I successfully figured out which ingredient goes with which properties, I feel like it was a successful game.

I love a lot of the aspects of this game. There is always enough to think about while others are taking their turn that it seems like it goes faster than it does. The deduction aspect and device app integration is fantastic. The only reason I didn't rate this higher is that sometimes I may not be in the mood for a euro-y game quite this long. Definitely want to play again soon. The screen/card stand leave something to be desired, though maybe a piece of tape or something across the slot would keep cards from sliding out better.

-Teach time is far too long. The CGE [u]employee[/u] who explained the game to us took 60 minutes. An expert teacher could probably do it in 30 minutes, but it's still far too high of a learning curve. I have no interest in spending over 20 minutes to learn any game, no matter how good it might be.

-The game itself is far too long for what it is. Lots of parts feel convoluted, like they felt like the deduction game wasn't enough, and started to just throw in other mechanics (worker placement, auction, bluffing...etc.) to add more "game". Every Euro mechanic but the kitchen sink made it into this game.

-Artifacts seem wildly unbalanced and untested, even some fans admit this.

-The most unforgiving game I've ever played. The smallest of errors means 3 hours are down the drain. I am okay with a small error destroying you in a deduction game, but don't make it take 3 hours if it's going to be that unforgiving.

-Even if you make no actual "mistakes", the game can come down to one or two 50/50 chances you take. The game is waaaaaaaay too long for this sort of coin flip to victory.

Overall, the length is the main problem here, and most of my problems with the game stem from that.Too long and unforgiving.

I believe this is the heaviest weighted game we have in our collection at the moment. I see many people trading their copies of Alchemists, many unopened or unpunched. I think this is a huge mistake! This game is incredible. It is equal parts deduction and worker placement. The rules are quite intimidating but the game offers 2 variants for players just starting out and players who are more confident with the gameplay. This game's use of smart phones/tablets/computers is awesome. All players can share on device or use their own personal devices by inputting a shared code that is randomly generated. This code is linked to the game's deduction element and ensures that all player's combination of ingredients generate the same potion results. This game is definitely for experienced gamers but it is one of the most beautifully striking games we own. This one definitely needs considerable table space though!

I love this game. It's a Euro. It's worker placement. It's deduction.

But doesn't it fail the glance test mentioned in 7 Wonders? Kinda. Each player does have a public board to display resources and vague information they have gathered. What the game does have is what I'll call the Tank test - the player has to go into the "Tank" of their mind and sort out what to do. And this game demands that from the player because you can't really get much help with the information behind your screen.

Note: 7 Wonders does this too, but feels like more of Glance game than a Tank game. Maybe the best way to define the difference is in how a game allows players to respond or compete with each other. Do players need to keep glancing to calculate a response or to go into the tank to calculate one?

Timbuktu szebb kinézettel és komolyabb körítéssel. Egy dedukciós játékot kapunk, amibe belecsempészték a jó öreg munkáslerakós mechanizmust. 8 főzetről kell kiderítenünk a három pontos alapanyagát. Ezt úgy tudjuk megtenni, hogy kísérletezünk adott kettő összeöntésével, ami után egy app megmondja, hogy a kettő milyen kölcsönhatásban van egymással. Ebből következtethetünk a két főzet egyes összetevőire. A munkáslerakós rész csak körítés tulajdonképpen, a lényeg a kevergetés. Miután egyre több információnk van megpróbálunk javaslatot tenni a pontos összetételre. Ezt tehetjük blöffölve akár rosszul is, ezzel megkeverve az ellenfeleket, de mehetünk tuti biztosra is. Véleményem szerint a tuti biztos stratégia egyrészt unalmas, másrészt szerencsével verhető. A játékban van két fajta bónuszkártya. Az egyik kisebb segítséget jelent egy-egy körben, a másik fajta pénzbe kerül és érzésem szerint elrontja a játékot a túlzott beavatkozásával. Hihetetlen erősnek érzek egy-egy ilyen kártyát és négy játékos esetén csak három szerezhet belőle az első körben és akkor sem biztos, hogy a véletlenül felcsapott három mind erős. Azaz adott esetben csak a kezdő játékos kap jó kártyát. A másik gondom a játékkal az újrajátszhatóság. Elsőre persze érdekes az apphasználat és a kevergetés, de többedikre én unalmasra saccolom. A játék szép, a téma mondjuk átjön, de valahogy nem éreztem átütőnek az összképet és rontó dolgok is voltak, amikről írtam. Ha valaki hibázik benne, akkor azzal elszállhat az egész játéka, nem megengedő a hibák terén. Érzek benne runaway leader problémát is. Nem rossz, de én köszönöm nem kérem a gyűjteményembe.

Two of my favorite things combined... Worker placement and deduction. I think the flavor of this game is awesome (aided by a GREAT rulebook). What really set it apart is the publishing theories aspect. You're encouraged to publish early because whoever has the most theories/endorsements gets a bonus point at the end of every round. But you're also encouraged to debunk theories to gain 2 points. So when publishing early theories, if you hedge your bet correctly, you can gain 4 points from one ingredient (at the cost of 2 gold).

I've really enjoyed my plays of this. It's a euro at it's core and I like the take on worker placement. It's a cool theme and most of the game makes a lot of sense thematically. I enjoy the deductive element a lot and I think the use of the app is implemented very well. That said I think this is a game I need to be in the mood for. The main reason is the length as both of my 3 player games were 3 1/2 hours plus. I know this is because we are learning the game but honestly I don't see this game getting below 45 mins a player. It can also be a bit overwhelming when you are trying to do deeper levels of deduction while keeping the game moving. Despite this I expect it to get it's fair share of table time.

You can add this to the list of games I adore despite not necessarily being something I often gravitate towards.  I'm not the biggest fan of deduction games but despite that I was always kind of excited for this game because of the integration with an app that is actually far from just a gimmick but makes each game variable.  I love genuine replayability in my games and this one offers a lot of that in a really beautiful, elegant, and fun package.

As stated above, this is a deduction game.  The players are all alchemists and the game includes 8 ingredients.  Each of these 8 ingredients is made up of a set of 3 properties.  When combining two ingredients it makes 1 of 7 possible potions and this information allows you to deduce the properties of each of the 8 ingredients.  The actions in this game are all taken via pseudo-worker placement.

I really love the turn order choosing phase of this game.  Very much like Fresco you can choose where to go in turn order, going later gets you more stuff than going earlier.  However, they beefed up the advantage of going first, not only do your actions resolve first but you also choose your actions last so you get information on where all the other players are going as well.  There are equal number of action spaces for each player, which is why I call it "pseudo" worker placement, but many of the spaces have advantages to going first.

The game is bright, colorful, and pretty.  Everything feels really sturdy and functional and the game even has a lot of thematic flare.  Also, the app integration is certainly not just a gimmick, it allows the aspects of each of the ingredients to be determined randomly each time you play without the need for a game manager who doesn't get to play.

I find the game not only extremely cerebral but fun and this combined with the unlimited replayability, beaufiful appearance, and reasonable ease-of-access make it a nearly perfect game.

I really enjoyed the deduction part of this game and the theme was really integrated into the mechanics for a euro game (testing the potion). The app was an excellent addition to the game in order to check a combination of ingredients. Unfortunately, the unclear rule book took away from the enjoyment as I think some things could have been more streamlined.

A very fine that I'm still trying to parse. The problem is that the CGE rules, as with virtually all their games these days, are simply ridiculously laid out, and missing a lot of useful data.

Clever deduction game where players are alchemists working to deduce the interaction of various components. It's an expensive life, so it's possible to earn money by (for example) selling potions, but the ultimate goal is prestige, accrued most notably by publishing theories (or disproving others' flawed ones). 

If I was left lukewarm is because this is all managed through a worker placement mechanism -- turn order is important etc. -- and so it's about as impure a deduction experience as you can get. The fact that it's possible to publish incorrectly, either deliberately as bluff or by erroneous educated guess, makes for a fascinating intersection: the reputation earned does have benefits for your engine, so even an incorrect guess may provide short-term benefits.

Unfortunately the result is reasonably complex and long enough to outstay its welcome. If you game as a social experience then it's important to know that this is not a game that may be problematic for players lacking attention to detail; the length compounds the issue common to most deduction games that incorrect record-keeping can easily put a player out of contention. 

There are also some mildly frustrating random elements (e.g. available artifacts) which may or may not reward turn order.

The novelty which attracted the most attention on release is the use of an app to provide appropriately partial information about how components interact, whether a theorem is proved/disproved etc. It's extremely well done, with an excellent interface, image recognition to avoid data entry etc., and so the game is worth playing if just to demonstrate how apps really can seamlessly enhance a social board game experience. The requirement to have a human moderator has always been a problem for hidden-information games.

My main criticism is, as ever, that the mashup of worker placement and deduction is less than the sum of its parts. It's enjoyable enough a combination, but I'd prefer to play a purer deduction game, like Letters from Whitechapel, Tragedy Looper or Hanabi, or an efficiency game without the deduction.

RATING: 6
The deduction challenge at the center of this game is really obfuscated by the "big/little" and "+/-" differentiators.  The visual challenge of distinguishing between the faintly printed, tiny plus and minus signs didn't improve the situation.  A reasonably clever and interesting game if you can get past that and get your smartphones synched.  On second playing:  Dropping the rating by a point.  There is too much stuff going on in this game, too many rules.  Granted, in order to make a game out of an exercise in deduction, they needed to throw some rules at it.  But they've overdone it.  For example, in the last round (and the last round only) there's an option to fulfill a recipe for a point, and to fill the recipe for the +/- of the same color for another point, and if you can fill them both, it's worth two points.  But you have to be the first one to do it to get the single point for fulfilling a recipe -- but you DON'T have to be the first one to do it to get two points for filling them both.  Nothing about this brace of rules improves the game; it just slows down the learning and the playing.

This is a fun game with more strategy than is first apparent.  The rules are a bit more complicated than they probably need to be, but the rulebook is so cleverly written that it is a pleasure to read.  The game combines resource usage with deduction and bluffing.  There is a bit of a steep learning curve for first time players, but the game has a lot of good replay value.

The deduction mechanic is pretty interesting and novel, but the rest of the game is bog-standard worker placement and doesn't push the game out of been-there-done-that territory.

[CGE 2014 Edition] {Alchemist; seduction, action-point-allowance, variable-player-order; optimal 4p} I start to admire the design of CGE games - usually novel and refreshing.

Alchemist is a pleasant surprise.  I don’t much about this game but it got high rating among my buddies.  After reading the rules, it attracts so much as I like deduction games.

Unlike other deduction games, this is not really a puzzle solving exercise.  There are interaction, competition and resource management.  You can’t just be the logically smartest to win this game.

The game design and components are wonderful.  The theme integrates with the game so well.

Love it immediately.

The single biggest problem is how can I teach the game easily to my friends.

I played this game 2 times (3-player, apprentice) now and it intrigues me. I like the fact that I could win without doing a lot of deduction and the fact that I could not do that a second time. I am not sure if I want to play this often, especially when I'm done with the gorgeous artwork, the cleverness of the system and the humor in the rules. I will drink a random potion if this reaches 10 plays. I will update when I play another player count or the master version.

After getting my head wrapped around the rules and the logic sheet, the game became very fun. I do a lot of logic puzzles, so I don't know why all those + and - signs gave me so much trouble. I finally got it all sorted out in my brain, but for me the symbols weren't intuitive. The game itself is a lot of fun, but we have never had much luck with the final exhibition.

Really love the deduction component of the game and how that works, but the rest of the game feels so clunky and tacked on for semi-thematic reasons (like poisoning students and drinking potions yourself that hurt you). Just feels weird and hard to remember so many little things that are going on when I just want to play a competitive deduction game. Also, with very good players, it seems to boil down to whoever gets lucky on the first few turns and can get a good cross section of components and potion types. The whole "catch up" mechanism where you lose more points if you're farther ahead is annoying as well. Finally, there is a decent amount of downtime as people have to plan out their whole turn instead of just each taking turn placing workers.

Like, there are so many niggling things that on their own might not be problematic, but when they all add up over the course of the game it becomes taxing. The game overall is fine, and I'd play it again, but I wish someone would just take the app and the potion components and make a better game with it.

Alchemists is really reliant on it's gimmick - but what a gimmick! Try to deduce the contents of the secret formula - but walk a fine line between guessing quickly and guessing well.

A disappointment because I expected more. A normal worker placement combined with very simple logic deduction.

Most of the time you are just crossing alchemicals off a chart, there isn't any logic deduction to it. There are a few leaps you must make with logic deduction, such as with neutral potions, but even these are simple after playing a few times.

Overall, it just felt like a normal worker placement game with the use of an app.  A revolutionary idea, but not fun.

Wow. This game has to be my favorite one right now. I love logic problems, and the logic and deduction in this game is phenomenal. It fits in extremely well with the overall theme of the game. The app integration is what makes this game solid. You can have a randomizer that hides the information very well.  I really hope to start seeing more and more games that integrate with phone or tablet (and with a valid reason to integrate with something like this). Our first play in apprentice level took close to an hour for rules explanation and then about 3 1/2 hours to play. There's a touch of AP, but not as much as I thought there would be. You get delayed more by doing your reasoning and deduction than really getting AP, which I'm fine with that.  I'm ready to get it on the table again!

We played it two times in one evening - and that's quite telling, since the game is a real brain burner. I quite enjoyed the deduction, and I was pleasantly surprised at how the game pushes you to publish theories before you're ready - and how that affects the game. You know that the theories out there probably aren't entirely correct, but you can still use it as a guideline. The master rules for debunking are great too. All in all, a great game that I look forward to play again - with the right group, mind. If you or anyone in your group don't like thinky, brain-burning games, stay away.

tl;dr: solid, intriguing design.
Some people hate having electronic elements in board games. I'm not sure if I like the idea, but it works in this game as it's simply there as a way to avoid having someone - who can not partake in the game - looking up results all the time.
This is a game in which you deduce formulas in order to use what you found to score points. On this first play however I was so caught up in deducing stuff that I missed most opportunities to score points. For one thing, I only realized late in the game that you should put a banner on the board each time you have only 2 possible results for a certain resource. That's a good way to score some points. It didn't help that my first 3 combinations resulted in zilch. Other players where building up information and I had close to nothing.
I liked the game and would be happy to play again, but this first play was rather frustrating. Still, a solid design!

I had a lousy first play of this, in part from some bad luck in the early mixes I made, but it felt a lot as though it was a mediocre worker placement game with a lousy deduction game bolted on to it. 

The random factors also seem to detract from it as does the overwhelming ability to get screwed out of something just 'because'. An example; I was interested in picking up an artifact, but the player going last (I was third in placing) also had enough money to buy it, so I did other things instead. Next turn, that same player has spent his money, didn't seem to want the artifact last turn and is again the only player placing after me, so this time I place a worker to buy the artifact. The player after me places a worker on selling a potion and then places above me to take the artifact, leaving me with nothing. 

Too much noise and randomness for me I suspect, where there's little to read other players' actions.

I'll be reading the rulebook shortly and I'll try it again to see if it was just an isolated experience, but this gimmick failed to excite or entertain me.

RATING: 8.5
I love this game so much! I really enjoy the simulation of academia (probably not that surprising since I am in academia). Everything is so thematic while still having solid euro mechanics. I love the logistics of collecting your resources for the experiment, testing your potions on a student or yourself (and maybe suffering the consequences!), and using deduction (and sometimes induction) to determine the composition of the ingredients to publish your theories. I also love having to reason about what kinds of ingredients your want to publish on so as to establish yourself in the field and get grant money. It's especially great that even if your theory is debunked, you still get to keep the money from the grant!

Like I said, I love this game. However, the deduction aspect gets a bit easy and repetitive somewhat quickly (especially if you have familiarity with formal logic). I will probably be picking up the expansion soon in an attempt to make the deduction a bit more challenging... or at least make the decisions of what to research more challenging since you'll be spread a bit more thin and you won't have the resources to do it all.

The game play is very unique and I can't really compare it to any other game.  The deduction was fascinating and really kept my brain working.  I love how publishing theories works in that you (A) don't need to be 100% sure, (B) you get grants and reputation for publishing, and (C) you can use other people's theories to your advantage if you believe they are right.  The whole theme is great.

I also like the worker placement in this game.  I know it's not the usual "action denial" style of worker placement, but honestly I am sick of that kind and it feels like lazy game design at this point.  The player order in Alchemists is very important and it makes the worker placement very interesting.

The artwork is fun, and the mini-game deduction works really well. The app really adds to the enjoyment and artwork is beautiful. I don't think its a downside rather then just because the game has a learning curve but its hard to introduce this to new people since they spend one game not really knowing what they are doing. However, if you can get past that, it is a blast.

Very interesting and unique game of deduction and calculated risk taking.  It's like Clue on steroids.  The theme is awesome, the integration with the smart phone app is brilliantly done and game-play is engrossing.  I've only played it once and I enjoyed it, even though I really didn't have much clue what I was doing.

Essentially you are trying to figure out which compounds make up which ingredients.  You accomplish this by mixing ingredients and seeing what they make, thus allowing you to slowly eliminate possible compounds for ingredients off your deduction grid.  It's basically a big logic problem where all the unknowns are randomly generated by the smart phone app and clues are slowly given out throughout the game, by the app.

But there is a lot more than just a logic problem going on here.  It's a clever worker placement game as well, filled with bluffing and trying to outmaneuver opponents.  And the point system highly encourages publishing theories before you are sure of something, which adds luck and the penalty for guessing wrong can be pretty steep.  But it's all about taking calculated risks and hedging your bets correctly.

I did very poorly in my first game and found out we had played part of it wrong so I left with a skewed impression of it.  But now that I have played a few games on boiteajeux.net (great online version of it) I feel more at ease with the game and look forward to trying it again with our gaming group.  But be warned, there are a lot of rules in this game (even though the rule book is well written and even comical) and you will find yourself going over a section of the rules several times before you wrap your brain around it.  I would recommend trying it online first.  That is the best way to learn it.

I'll be revisiting this review after a few more plays with my game group.

Would probably be a great game for Ravensburger's Tiptoi (but on the other hand their target group are families with kids). Some players have difficulties to understand the deduction mechanic, and then the game does totally not work for them when they always mix random ingredients and never get the intended results.

This is so unlike anything I've ever played before. I applaud the designer for trying something new and creating a worker-placement sudoku-like deduction game that feels somewhat "solitair-esque" but that oddly enough runs by fast and you never feel like it overstays its welcome. That being said by someone who usually isn't fond of deduction games. There will be downtime at first, which is a result of the new kind of approach this game takes and requires, not because it's prone to AP by nature. All this combined with Cochards artwork and the lovely details (The discworld references for instance) make this a very enjoyable experience that I am looking forward to delve into much more.This is wonderful

Played it twice, very nice.

It's novel combination of several game mechanics, and it works out well. The basics are 1) worker placement and 2) deduction a la Cluedo/Clue. In addition, the game uses a smart phone app which plays the role as a gamemaster of sorts, the only one knowing the makeup of each ingredient and thus the resulting effect of mixing two of the eight availible ingredients. The app worked well for us.

First impressions: Correct deduction is the key to winning, and some amount of bluffing is therefore essential versus experienced players, If your opponents know that you are never bluffing, it will be too easy for them drawing conclusions from your actions. However, each bluff is risky since you can and will get debunked. Aquiring a reputation as a some who bluffs all the time, though in practice you actually don't, seems like good strategy to win the psychological game.

I won my two games, scoring above 30 and 40, and I believe that the only thing I did better than my opponents, who were all experienced gamers though new to the game just like myself, was drawing conclusions from their actions. I always published lots of theories that I wasn't sure of, but guessed based on my opponents actions, and ignored artifacts until the final round where some optimization (Agricola-style) is required to maximize your score.

After two plays: 
Excellent integration of technology into a board game without being gimmicky.  The deduction element isn't as straightforward as it first appears (or as complicated, either).  Turn order is essential at some stages, so the two-tiered worker placement is a welcome implementation.  The artwork and components are top-notch, which is icing on the cake.  Some frustration has been expressed at the randomness of the card draws or of someone taking a stab at a hunch and inadvertently blocking your sure thing, but neither has kept the game from being fun for me.

This is certainly due for an update after a few more plays to see how it holds up.

An amazing new generation game that flawlessly combines euro and thematic elements while efficiently exploiting a smartphone application to minimize bookeeping.

This is a heavy strategy game, one that combines action selection with heavy deduction, minor bluffing and push your luck in a way that truly delivers. The theme is the game, and you really feel like an Alchemist, agonising for the result of every expiriment, trying to figure out what is what by pushing your students, your clients and even yourself over the limits all the time. The whole publication "mechanism", full with its grands and diprovals is simply awesome. The interaction in this game is great, as half the game is action selection with an extremelly important player order and the other half is trying to understand what the other players really know and use it to your advantage. Downtime is a non-issue for anyone who is interested in the game, as the deduction part is so engaging and logical that you can get lost in it even if your opponents take an eternity to play. (which is not the case anyway - the actions are simple enough for anyone with half a plan). The application solves like magic the issue of complexity, and since the bookeeping is also solved with excellent components the game really sucks you in it.

So anything to complain about? Well, this is not the game to take with you in the deserted island, as with no power supply you just can't play it. :) For all those app-haters, please think of the app as your automated "dungeon master": It builds the world for you and reavels it gradually, based on your actions - it really serves the boardgame. I can see people hate this game however - whoever finds the deduction part tiring and uninteresting will have a 2.5h ride of pure boredom.

This game amazed me, even if I didn't really expect it.

What I like:

-The deduction aspect of this is nothing short of brilliant. New puzzle everytime made possible by the app. It's such a great brain exercise.
-The theme - I love being a scientist in games and this truly replicates and imitates the feel of the pressure to publish and research but also the glory of making the big breakthrough versus incorrect and replaced theories
-The look and humor. The clear colors and the style of painting is beautiful and the jokes are funny and help immerse me.
-The fact that you can to choose to instead go for money and artifacts and do semi-gambles with your academic theories based on other peoples' work make the outcome unpredictable until the very end and it gives even new players a chance to win if they are willing to take chances. 
-Scales well 

Absolutely my favorite heavy deduction game

What I don't like: 
It's a little hard to teach since you have to teach both the deduction and the game. Also I would have preferred if it was just a bit shorter.

I was interested to see how effective games that implement digital apps can be. Well, this game was really fun! It can feel a little bit gimmicky, but I think overall the application can make some tense and exciting moments. Also a great game of bluffing and misdirection.

I knew going into this game that it was "the hotness" and that at least one person needed an app to play it. I was a little worried that it would be hokey because of that. As it turned out, I rather enjoyed that aspect of the game.

We're alchemical researchers who are gathering ingredients, testing concoctions on students (or in dire straits, on ourselves), publishing theories (where you want to be first author for more reputation), debunking other's theories, and selling potions to whoever will pay.

The game is a fairly standard worker placement game, but there's a turn order auction every round and you have to place all your workers out in one go, in reverse turn order. So going last means other people can swoop in after you and make your placements look stupid. And then there's the app/deduction aspect.

A large part of the game revolves around a deduction mechanic. And this is where the app comes in. When you drink a potion, you place the two ingredients on the table behind your screen and line the app up over them. It tells you what potion you've made. Poisoning, paralyzing or driving your student insane means they'll need to be bribed to quaff any further potions (so being the first to conscript the student for the round is a good idea). And drinking something vile yourself has dire consequences.

Once you know what potion you've made, there's a pyramidal chart in your player board that you plug the corresponding chit into. And you have a sheet with a table where you can mark your inferences. You'll want to deduce the properties of each ingredient which lets you know what potions it can make with other ingredients (or vice versa, knowing what potion two things make can tell you the properties of those ingredients). For some reason this part of the game didn't click with me until halfway through the game, but it's not particularly difficult or onerous. Figuring out what potions are shouldn't be too much of a problem.

At the end of the game there's an exhibition, where you can demonstate which potions you've figured out, but only the first person to display a potion gets any fame. And at the end of the game all the theories are evaluated and you get points for authoring correct theories.

Initially I liked this game a lot... I loved the theme, and the deduction aspect was an interesting twist to the game. It really added to the feeling of being an alchemist figuring out how to make various potions.  But the more I play it the more I realize that I just don't like the deduction part of the game.  It's like you're playing a worker placement game while solving a puzzle, and I just don't have that much interest in puzzles.

There's a good game here, you just have to be willing to scale a mountain to find it. First-time players are essentially expected to learn two games at once. For many, this is too much. Even after a couple plays, juggling the two intertwined games is a challenge bordering on overwhelming and this stifles social interaction at the table. Ultimately, I traded it because of the difficulty in teaching it and its tendency to overwhelm/intimidate players.

Really enjoyed my two plays of this. There's a lot going on for rules compared to the other euro games I've played recently, but it was such a unique experience. I will say that my second game felt similar to the first that it makes me wonder whether there's enough variety game to game. 

I've also seen mixed reviews about apps being used in table top games, and I didn't mind this part at all. It's a small part of the game, and it worked well. It makes it seem like you're actually in a lab mixing up potions. Plus if you don't want to use the app you don't have to, you'll just need a gamemaster that's happy to not play and watch the other players slowly try to decipher his puzzle.

We're finding the game on top of the logic puzzle.  It seems interesting, but I'm not sure about the balance of the various artifacts.  More games required.

I'm feeling there's not much of a game below the deduction.  It tried for greatness but fell rather short of expectations.

RATING: 2
I really wanted to like this game but I just had a terrible experience for a variety of reasons-- some of those my fault, some others, and some the games.  I don't know if I'd call this bad game, but it's definitely not a good one.  Just a mediocre game in a good looking game's disguise with a slick app.

I played this at BGG.CON 2014 and my first problem was the two people teaching us-- they were just bad teachers.  Not the games fault at all, but it took them about an hour and a half to teach us the game when it shouldn't have taken more than 20-30 minutes.  It was almost comically bad how bad these two people were at teaching games.

Anyways, within the first turn I was already in trouble.  See, I had the misfortune of going to last and the two people that knew how to play had the luck of going first.  One guy immediately bought the artifact that essentially double his points (gleefully pointing out that the item won him the last game he played) and the second guy happily bought the artifact that let him throw away only one ingredient when mixing potions.

Lets just take a moment to marvel at how broken both of these items are that you can buy on the *first turn*.

On one hand, you have an item that essentially doubles your points (until the very end of the game).  That is just completely ridiculous.  The only way you can even compete with that is if you have something that miraculously gives you elements...like an artifact that lets you keep half your ingredients.  Yes, we had one person that doubled their points every time they scored and another that had to forage only half as often as everybody else.  Needless to say, me and the other person were hopelessly behind.  Even worse, we were hopelessly behind for no reason other than we had the misfortune of not being first.

And that brings about the next problem-- there's no rubber banding in this game.  Games like this need rubber banding.  A game like Power Grid lets the person in last place do everything first because otherwise the person ahead will just get further ahead and leave everyone in the dust.  That's what happened in my game!

So anyways, I was last which meant I got to experiment on the student last.  Which meant I had to waste gold on that.  Which meant I to transmute more elements.  Which meant I had to forage more often.

So what do you do when you run out of gold?  Well, you experiment on yourself!  Unfortunately this game has a large luck factor in those beginning rounds and luck was not on my side.  See, I had this fantastic ability to only find green negative potions when experimenting on myself...which meant I still was last even when I was first player.  So I was behind the whole game and it was miserable.

To make things worse, I messed up marking the results at one point and didn't realize until an hour later.  When I realized this, I of course checked my sheet and everything seemed right, which meant I put a peg in a wrong spot.  Yes, it was my fault but that one _easy_ mistake meant it was literally impossible for me to compete because everything I knew was wrong, I would have to retest *everything* to get valid information again, and it was just hopeless.  As complicated as this game is, it needs to handle player mistakes more gracefully.  When it's getting near 12:30AM and you just realized you've lost all chances of even coming in third, you really start questioning whether you want to ever play that game again.

So I sat there miserable for the next hour watching the two people who got the good magic items compete and I realized something-- there's literally zero player interaction in this game!

All three other players had their heads buried behind their screens the entire time looking at their sheets.  I constantly had to remind them to go (because I for sure didn't want that game to last any longer).  Again I bring up Power Grid, but at least in something like that you're competing over space or auctioning, in this, there's really nothing.  The person who places cubes first just accepts they're screwed and then goes back to fiddling with their sheets.

So I know I started off saying this game wasn't terrible, but the more I think about it the more I realize I hated this game.  It's just not a good game, it only looks like one.

RATING: 7.5
Wow this game has a lot off layers.  Not just the testing and deduction, but the race to publish, the battle for turn order, the mini game for selling potions, different paths to victory... This game can make your head spin. At the same time once you start solving the puzzle, you're grinning ear to ear at your own ingenuity.  

What a great and thematic spin on what is basically a worker placement game at it's core, with deduction worked around it and some neat action space mechanisms.

Bonus points in that I don't think I've ever had so much fun discussing a game after the fact.  The theme is worked into everything.

There is a fair amount of downtime, but I never for a second felt bored since there was always things to plan ahead for future turns and educated guesses to make on the deduction screen.

The downside of the game is really in how long it takes to teach, how many different elements there are to wrangle in your head, and therefore how difficult it is to pick up in your first play.  It takes 2 plays to really get on the same page with an experienced player.  the game can be very unforgiving where one deduction mistake or misplanned action can really ruin you.  It can be a bit too stressful for that reason so it's a game I'd have to be in the mood for.

One of the most interesting and unique games I have ever played. Deduction problem combined with worker placement.

At 4 players becomes an incredibly tight worker placement game with lots of opportunity to block people. It's a bit more open with less players, but at 4 I would call this by far the most player interaction I have ever seen in a euro.

The race to publish results first provides excellent incentive to guess or bluff allowing players to create a rich layer of intrigue of thier own. Do you trust something others have published? Do you know that something published is wrong but your not quite confident you can prove it? Do you just blatently make stuff up in order to win prestige and grants at the risk of losing face later?

The theme is excecuted magnificently and the game is genuinely funny on many occasions.

Only flaw that holds me from playing more often is that the rules are a bit bloated and teaching the game to new players can be annoying. I would put this in the "gamers only" category due to complexity and difficulty. Would have been perfect if they could have streamlined a few things just a little.

Expansion added some great mechanisms for variable resources I consider these modules auto includes and a must buy.

RATING: 3
Sudoku for imbeciles deduction game driven by a mediocre worker placement game buried in randomness, more randomness, and even more randomness.

A game of pointless deduction, mediocre worker placement, and random randomness with randomness on top.

Looked interesting and it is worth a try for the innovative phone/tablet app integration which works well, but unfortunately the game sucks. Basically advanced "Mastermind" burried under a mountainous mess of mechanisms and randomness upon randomness drawn out over 2-3 hours.

Interest dwindled rapidly already during the seemingly neverending setup and rules explanation.

Components wise, the illustrations are great but the board is far too busy and looks like a mess. The player screens are completely moronic with vertical deduction boards where the markers do not fit in the holes and are bound to fall out; and a tiny ledge where you are supposed to balance your ingredients cards for tests and then photograph them with the phone/tablet app which is an utterly pointless gimmick that is vastly slower than simply tapping on the two relevant cards in the app. But apart from this useless gimmick, at least the app works well and it would probably be a nightmare to handle the test results manually.

A completely and easily, methodically solvable deduction puzzle only limited by eventual initial ignorance of the steps to solve it; and ultimately by the randomly available/drawn ingredients cards, and the random "+" or "-" outcome of lab tests where "-" may arbitarily cost you a penalty, and the outcomes of uncertain client test may randomly give you more or less useful test results and eventually rewards or penalties.

When you know something from your tests, then the random test results and the randomly available/drawn ingredients cards may or may not match the randomly drawn client tile needed to get the gold needed to place your deducted solutions needed to score points.

What it boils down to is lucky draw of ingredients and lucky test outcomes to get a headstart through the run of the mill worker placement part to place the first, cheaper deduction results and pick up bonus scoring tiles. That is not much of a game for 2-3 hours.

.....

Clearly, I need to practice my getting random results skills:

My first round's two tests both completely randomly gave "-" results which are arbitrarily punished with a penalty ("+"/"-" are not "good"/"bad" but could just as well be "x"/"y" or anything else instead - the arbitrarily penalised "-" are simply defined as being poison for thematic fun).

My first round's two tests were also completely randomly both "blue" which gives you less information and which reduces your chances of matching the subsequent rounds' client demands.

The second round's completely random client demand tile happened to want "blue+" (or something red or something green), so no way for me with only two "blue-" to make a certain bid for a full reward but would instead have to settle for a partial bid for only a small reward, or to simply make a random two-to-one guess and risk another penalty.

Anyway, even the two-to-one guess was not possible as none of my five randomly drawn/available ingredients cards matched my test combinations' previous four ingredients cards. So my only option for a good reward would be a completely random fifty-fifty guess and risk another penalty - or do some additional testing instead and wait until next round where things were bound to be better .....

Yeah, right .....

Four of my first five test results all completely randomly turned out to be "blue-" (and a "green+") for further penalties and reduced information from another double "blue-" test. Seven of my nine test results all completely randomly turned out to be "-" for yet more penalties throughout the game.

The third round's completely random client demand tile again happened to want "blue+" or "green-" (or something red), so again no way for me with only four "blue-" and one "green+" to make certain bid for a full reward but would instead still have to settle for a partial bid for only a small reward, or to simply make a random two-to-one guess and risk another penalty.

Again, none of the third round's four randomly drawn/available ingredients cards matched any of my previous test combination's ingredients so still only possible to make completely random fifty-fifty guesses for client demands.

And blah blah blah .....

Knowing the correct, full solutions for six of the eight recipes after four (three and a half) rounds of absolutely no value scrambling to finally get the ingredients to get some gold to publish my solutions, many of which by now costs extra because of other players' already published solutions.

.....

At least there is half an hour or so of fun to be had by figuring out the few simple methodical steps to solve the puzzle part, and fortunately you do not need buy or play this very poor game to do so - simply download one of the deduction sheets and the iOS app. You can squeeze out a bit more fun also figuring out probabilities for yet unsolved parts. But after you have figured out these simple steps (and optionally probabilities), the deduction part of the game will be purely mechanical and of absolutely no interest, leaving you with just a very random, mediocre worker placement game.

I really love this game.  Having played several games, with scores all over the map and varying outcomes every time, I feel that it provides plenty of variability, even after players have become comfortable with the rules.
The margin for user error is very high, with the deduction grid for starters, and also the strategic planning to stretch your ingredients and gold through each turn.  But it's this constant challenge that makes the game so immersive and so exciting.  Often you find yourself realizing a plan you put in place several actions ago just crumbled at your feet, and just when you think you have it all down pat, an opponent disproves your theory (which you were quite confident in) and suddenly you're struggling to regain composure - and points!
Alchemists also has one of the most entertaining instruction manuals I've ever read - its both witty, and does a fantastic job explaining the thematic elements of its rules.
A truly fantastic and whimsical game.

The deduction puzzle, the thematic worker-placement, excellent bidding ruleset, the app, the art...
This game was the most popular game at Essen 2014, and with good reason!
Its highly original, extremely well designed and an absolute joy to play.

What a great idea for a game! Letting an App control the clues and information in a deduction game is a stroke of genius. When you are learning to play and just wandering around in the dark, the game is both intriguing and fun. 

I haven't played it a lot, so the rest of this is purely conjecture, but I suspect repeat plays will yield diminishing returns. Once everyone understands how to manipulate their clues, the game will be less about deduction and more about racing and pushing your luck. There is still a solid worker placement engine underneath the deduction stuff, I just think people will tire of trudging through foregone conclusions just to pull the levers beneath, over and over again.

I could be wrong though...as I certainly haven't mastered it yet. Neat game, at any rate.

I think the phone implementation is a genuine joy of playing this game, it shouldn't be discounted - things like this are fun to play around with. Unfortunately for me I don't feel the rest of the game lives up to how cool it is to be messing around with the app.

When I was in elementary school I was obsessed with the game clue. I would solo play that thing to death. The deduction intrigued me, and it's why so many years later I picked up this game without reading into much of anything. 

Then I opened the box, saw the weight of this game, and shoved it away. 6 months later my wife and I finally decided to put this on the table, and to our surprise, this was a really easy learn! It took us about an hour to have the rules completely figured out. 

The key was to understand and engage in the flavor behind each action. The rules to alchemists are so masterfully designed and fit the narrative so easily, that we were able to play the entire game after one rules read through and not refer back to the rules until scoring.  Read the flavor behind each action, come up with your own flavor where necessary, and you won't question any rules!

I don't like a lot of Euro style games, but this one tickled me in a way where it just felt like so much more than your standard euro. I love the way my wife and I interact when we play this game. She even found herself contesting her own results on her first playthrough! Which I found hilarious.

A fun deduction game with a neat app implementation. Players gather resources and use worker placement mechanics to create potions, the major goal being to figure out the alchemical makeup of different reagents. Players will publish their findings and sell their potions for extra cash, ultimately striving for a high score and reputation.

You are competing to be the most prestigious Alchemiet, by publishing your theories, debunking others theories and generally showing off.
A worker placement game, combined with a sudoko like logic puzzle. You combine two cards to make a potion, and try to figure out what the true nature of an ingredent is. The game uses a smartphone app to combine ingredients (by scanning th cards) and to randomize the solution to the puzzle for each game.

[i]Rating after one 4p game (more plays needed for final rating):[/i]

The worker placement part of Alchemists falls flat to me - it's probably the least interesting implementation of this mechanic I've ever encountered. I can't seem to get much enjoyment out of this game and the thought process behind everything doesn't seem to click with me. 

I'm sure many people will enjoy Alchemists, it's just not for me (which is a real shame, because I thought I would love it). Maybe I'll give it another try someday.

But I have to say that this is the best bang for the buck in terms of component quality I've ever seen in a board game. It looks absolutely amazing.

I was really excited to play this game because it looks so fabulous and it seemed to be "logically interesting".
I won my very first (and only) game.
Despite these two very favourable conditions, i really didn't like the game.
The biggest problem is it's sooo terribly complicated and inelegant. The rules for matching elements are quite tricky and the explanation takes soooo long that i was already depressed before actually starting.
The math behind  the game is sound and the deduction process is working. At the end of the game we pretty much knew a lot about the ingredients despite "only" 6 turns.
Components are very nice to behold but the disks are difficult to handle for inept people like me.
I hate to be dependent on a smartphone to play a boardgame but i understand the need for a "master"...still, i prefer to play a master-less game if this is the condition to avoid a smartphone.
One of us got two neutral potions in the first 3 experiments... his game was ruined forever.
Luck plays such a big role that i really feel i don't deserve my victory completely.
The theme is of course nice and interesting but the gameplay is scarse under a number of aspects. 
All in all, a bad experience.

Provisional rating. Low desire to play, since it needs either somebody with a smartphone or a non-playing master. Another drawback are the non-fitting tokens in our copy.

Oh, look, already a promo expansion for a brand new game? Call me out. I might play the game, but i will not buy it.

Rating reduced. No desire to play it. Nobody in the club played it more than once.

Woooo boy, this was one heck of a game. I knew going into it that this would be meatier than most games I play and that analysis (paralysis) was part of the game. I had traded for it and it just sat on my shelf for weeks and months before I even decided to try it, but when I did I’m glad I spent the time learning it.

I’m not going to go too deep into this one because it’s pretty hefty, but you’re an alchemist and your job is to figure out what ingredients do what so you can publish theories, sell potions, and show off at the exhibition. You’ll do this by trying out your potion on customers, students, and yourself by combining two ingredients using an app on your phone or tablet.

In two games my wife and I have each won once, both times within one point of the other and both times we’ve really enjoyed it. It’s one of those games that captivated her after our initial play and she’s now looking for chances to get it to the table. I’d recommend trying this game first, but it’s definitely worth that try.

Budding alchemists in a race to discover the ultimate secret of the mystical arts.  A worker placement deduction game that relies heavily on a smart phone app to manage the mixing of potion components and privately revealing the clues in solving the puzzle. Fun theme, gorgeous artwork, and well thought out. It requires use of huge player screens to keep track of your deductions which I'm not a big fan of.

The use of technology to manage randomness and privately sharing information is clearly more efficient and vastly superior to the old fashion boards and bits, bags and dice.  But, one reason I love board gaming is to get AWAY from computers and cellphones.  People are already way too obsessed with using their phones to do everything.  I hope we are not seeing the writing on the wall--the future of board gaming will be on smart phones. At the very least, we are well on our way to a hybrid group. I'm sure the gaming world is big enough for all of us. Just please don't let the temptation of slick tricks of technology replace the joy of fiddling and social face-to-face interaction. Resist becoming a society of electronic interfacers.

This score is not based on the ability of this games mechanics or creativity.  The reason why I have give this a 6 is because of the fun of the game battling against the problem solving part of the game.  What I mean is I have won the game from deciding what all of the elements are but never felt like a bumbling, silly alchemists.  The reason was because of the fear of losing my creditability.

This game is so much fun. However it can burn your brain out at certain points with how much there is to pay attention to. Also if you mess up recording a potion result at some point you will go insane trying to fix everything.

The app I think works really well. It's extremely simple and easy to use and eliminates having to have a player sit out and be a game master.

RATING: 7.445
The heart of a Alchemists is a deduction puzzle similar to Cluedo but more interesting and with more of a learning curve.  Instead of Cluedo's roll-and-move mechanic (worst thing about Cluedo) you have have a worker placement mechanic instead... and it is not simple.  You will be buying and selling ingredients, making potions to test theories or sell to adventurers, buying items that give you special bonuses, publishing and refuting theories in order to gain prestige and academic grants, all leading to a convention where you can try to prove yourself the best at alchemy.  I really like this game, but the steep learning curve can make it tricky to introduce to new players.

Whoever thought something like a logic puzzle and a worker placement game could have this much theme and fun?

It's a game where you have to be VERY careful as it's unforgiving to major screw-ups, but it's SO satisfying when you figure things out and use what you've learned to your advantage.

And while yes, there is a phone app, it really allows the game to be more complex without having to slow it down.

Very good deduction game in the middle of a very good worker placement game. There are several ways to score points and some of them do not involve deduction. You can publish incorrect information and throw off your friends or try to be accurate. Both have their place in this game. Playing order is important but even that can be overcome with the right special cards. Lots of fun.

Deduction/worker placement game where the object isn't to figure out the most things but to score the most points!

Super thematic with fun & goofy art, but the underlying game is intense and will require your thinking cap. I really enjoy this one, especially with the harder Master variant (although that can add AP as players try to figure things out.)

Definitely requires multiple plays to discover advanced possibilities for deduction and strategy. Unfortunately not colorblind-friendly at all.

Great design, as always from CGE; but the deduction technique really is "solvable".  Once you know how to correctly follow all the possible consequences of your experiments, the fun of that part of the game sort of disappears.  What keeps you guessing is observing the outcome of *other* peoples' experiments while trying to remember the cards they've been taking from the offer.

4 after 1 play.

The game comes with huge amounts of downtime and very low player interaction. There seems to be a lot of parts that can be cut out from the game.

Firstly, selecting player position every round before actually placing your workers. That can be removed and just have players place workers in sequential order, but one worker at a time.

Secondly, collecting ingredients to sell by converting to gold or to adventurers for a small amount of gold, which one needs to publish. Why not just remove the need for gold to publish and remove the roundabout?

Thirdly, one may even simply remove gold from the game and make the deduction part of the game as its centerpiece.

Last but not least, it is rather sad that a board game requires a mobile phone app to play. The checking required during testing of ingredients and selling to adventurers induces more downtime and further inhibits interaction.

The game's components are high quality, though over-produced. The top piece above each player's screen is not required and blocks out part of the view of the main board.

A good deduction game. I made the odd mistake here and there but it didn't punish me too heavily.

I love that solving the ingredients puzzle is not the whole of Alchemists, but rather part of the game. Usually deduction games fall apart because if one person accidentally gives a wrong answer, the game is ruined for all. Mess up an answer here, and you're (generally) hurting only yourself. I know Alchemists is on the heavier end of the spectrum, but I think it plays lighter than that. The decisions are straight forward, and there's a fun logic puzzle in the middle of it.

RATING: 9.2
One of the most rare elements in an Euro game is a theme that actually works. Well, with this one it really works. When playing, you are the guy on the cover of the box. You are mixing all those ingredients trying to find all of the solutions. Having said that, there is also the big minor point with this game. And that is the app. Everybody will say that you won’t have to use the app to play the game. Well, they are absolutely right. You won’t need an app. But when you don’t use the app, you will need somebody who is willing to stare at the gameboard for two hours. Watching every move that is made, doing nothing until somebody asks “What do I get when I mix Mandrake root and scorpion tail?” He can say two words then, and then, just wait again, until somebody will ask him a result of a mixture again. And all the time he’s just sitting there. Staring and thinking: “I want to play along!” To be short. Using the app will make the game easier and more fun for everybody. And that’s where another concern comes in. How long will the app be usable on a phone. I mean, 10 years ago nobody heard of an android OS. What kind of OS will a phone use in 10 years. Will there be an app for that OS by then? I really am afraid that there won’t be an app for it then. On the other hand, it shouldn’t be too hard to make a table with all the possibilities in a spreadsheet yourself. Just fill in the ingredients on page 1, and click on a button and that will give you the result. Is using the app necessary? Actually, yes it is. Enough about the app. It isn’t a novelty, but the implementation in the game is just great. It works perfectly (if you have enough light in the room you’re playing).

A 20 pages rule-book almost automatically means that this isn’t an easy game. Well, it isn’t easy, but it isn’t hard either. There is just a lot of keeping track of. The rules are written very clearly, and after reading them once you should be able to explain the game to somebody else. Please take in count that you will need about 30 minutes to do that.

Playing the game is quite an experience. It might take a couple of rounds before you understand the game, but then it flows naturally. The deduction part of the game is the main mechanic, and to us, it was completely new in a board game. After playing the game, I was overwhelmed by it. In a good way. Wow, this is just refreshing. This is something different. Let’s play it again!

Played once with two players: it felt like working, instead of playing. There was not much interaction and it felt like solving a very expensive sudoku. I hope that with more players the game will flow better.
Another complain is on the "results triangles" component: not a very smart way to keep track of important information, since the tokens do not fit into the holes!

This is a great deduction game, possibly the best out there. It's a race to try to solve each of the eight ingredients and then publish those results, which leads to some interesting choices: should you try to publish early on a 50/50 shot of getting it right or wait one more turn to make sure you're correct, but also risk having someone publish that info before you can? The extra options like buying artifacts and selling potions make for lots of strategy since you can only do so many things per turn.

I was surprised at the weight of the box, a little disappointed it was entirely due to the player shields, but impressed by how good everything else looked. A couple tokens tore the punchboard when they came out, and the DM board (when you don't have an app, and you do have a friend who wants to be involved but not actually play) is quite wrecked, but I wasn't planning on ever using that, so it's in a drawer. I appreciate the number of bags, and also the two little plastic containers that I have assumed are for the potion tokens and money.

Quite interesting. First game was mostly an exercise in Clue-like deduction (albeit far more complicated than Clue), however looking at how much you can risk guesses or coast based on others' published revelations, and how the advanced game rewards higher risk approaches, I think further plays will be even more interesting. The app integration is fun.

A bit of worker placement, a touch of deduction, and an app for your smart device that essentially just randomises the puzzle. Really lovely components make this a feast for the eyes, and the game itself is at least intriguing, and at times very good.

I have a few concerns as to its longevity however, as I can't see how you'd approach the game too different time after time, but right now, I think this is a really solid one, that meshes board game and technology really well.

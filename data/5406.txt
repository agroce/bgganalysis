OK Game. 3 player results in a bit too much land to expand in and cards to select from. Scores always close which either means the game is well balanced or your choices actually have little impact in the long run - I haven't worked out which one yet. Plays quickly though.

Easy going tile laying area control game that can get real tight for space as each family grows. Works really well as an intro into eurogames. Needs good strategic play with 4 players.

A nice development game. Getting land tiles to rush for the area is important in the beginning, but having other type of developments give you great advatnage as well. The game can be played in a fast pace. No down time at all!

RATING: 7
Game nicely combines an auction with an area influence mechanism.  The auction results indicate not only the player order, but also the cost of the player's actions for that turn.  Thus each turn, the players must decide not only what tile and/or card they want, but also how much each is worth.  This makes each turn unique and engaging and drives the players to constantly rethink the strategy. Plays quickly, even for beginners.  A solid game that is almost a great game, but falls a bit shy.

RATING: N/A
Fun and light tile placement game. I am surprised this wasn't a bigger hit as it seems not that many people know about it. This game has an interesting auction-like system for getting tiles and cards. Each player takes a chip ranging from 1 to 10 in turn order. Higher number buys their stuff first but has to pay the number taken for each thing they buy. You are trying to get tiles of matching landscapes next to your starting tiles and then use cards to turn them to their developed side for VP's. You can also get cards that allow you to add pilgrims, barns or ships to undeveloped tiles that give various bonuses (extra income, ability to hold cards, etc.). Board is very tight with 4 players and not so much with 3. I am really on the fence as to try to trade or sell this one. Let me know your thoughts about what I should do!

Not a bad little game.  There is definitely some thought required when picking how much you want to spend per token, and then figuring out which cards/tiles are the best ones at the time, but it's just ok.  Good land tension with 4 players, far too open with 3.  Play with the variant setup for 3 players.

I disagree with the comments that say this is not a three-player game. At Halesowen Boardagmers we have played several three-player games; all have finished within a few points of each other and have gone to the wire. In some ways, three player is better because the board is not so crowded at the beginning.

RATING: 8
This game has a lot of tension and is the perfect length (less than 1 hour).  It is a little overwhelming for some and the players really do need to understand the frequency of the building / development cards so their land expansions aren't silly. There is some luck involved in the card draws, but like all deck-based games the distribution is balanced through the course of the game. I do NOT like choosing bid tokens in clockwise order... If there was an easy mechanic for selecting bid tokens in the PREVIOUS turn's order, that would be more balanced: A player who bought first last round has to pick bid token first. etc.

RATING: 8
In the trio of Princes of Florence, Puertro Rico and New England, this was the only one I really liked. The key differences to my mind are:

1) A shared board on which the challenge of creating geometrically suitable real estate is concflict of interests, unlike the solitaire effectors of Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico. By and away my greatest issue with those latter games.

2) A wonderful bidding mechnaism. FOolishly simple yet combing cost and return in a really useful way.

3) General simplicity. The only thing it pays to know is the mix of cards that are available and they are few. A summary is easy to note up front, and for those of poor memory to write down or download any number of variants of. You cna learn to play and to play a reasonable game very quickly and from there progress into exploring options. With Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico on the othe rhand, there is such a welth of knowledge to collect about available resources that there's a significantly steeper learning curve.

SO, it's a simple game, easy to explain, quick to enough to play, beautiful tom look at, uses some charming play mechanisms and is on shared real estate (as opposed to a recent fashion of multiplayer solo board games - with the game played on your own board and interaction restricted to the acquisition of things to put on that board). 

A wonderful game.

I found it interesting at first, but after several plays it has lost much of its appeal.  I like the purchasing mechanism, but the overall game play is fairly analytical and static.  The elements of the game are similar enough to others I have so I see little reason to play this one anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played once, but it seems like a good placement scoring game. The territory grabbing can be more tense than in Oasis, but the luck of the draw with the development cards has a much larger effect here. It's very important to go for at least one of the bonuses (ships, barns or pilgrims), and to break ties and stay ahead whenever possible for multi-point swings.

RATING: 5
I've knocked my rating down to a 5 from when I first played it ... New England is a decent enough game, but given the other games I have on my shelf, it has zero repeat draw. There just isn't anything in there that encourages you to come back ... it's dry, the decisions aren't that interesting, there is hardly any tension; I can't help but think of it as a poor man's Through the Desert. Sure, Through the Desert doesn't have auctions, but the auctions in New England just don't present tough choices, so it largely boils down to a tile-laying game. Through the Desert is similarly dry, but has so many interesting decisions - while New England is just pedestrian and hardly engages. Dwarfed by Domain, a game of similar complexity (which has perhaps slightly more raw rules but a cleaner system), but vastly more interesting play. I was lukewarm about trying another Goldsieber big-box game, and it turns out I was right ... New England is the only game I've ordered direct from Germany this year that I've modestly regretted purchasing. Oh yeah, and combine all this with the fact that the three-player game basically doesn't work at all.

I've only played one game to date. Again one of those many solid games which however fails to stand out among all the quality games out there these days. The theme is very light and it might have been just as well a game set on Mars. Really, a pity as the pilgrim theme as such is pretty cool, IMO. Well, what does this mean gamewise? That it's pretty dry. And neither the bidding nor the action choices lead to great excitement. Interesting decisions are sure part of the package, but it feels in terms of excitement as if you're just plowing along. Fairly pedestrian. I also concur with an earlier poster that the game ends a tad too early. I would prefer the game board becoming much fuller and thus reward/penalize those more who've handled that part of the game well or badly. But that may be not such a problem with four players. For three players going for a variant reducing the available items seems the way to go.

And, oh, I think the game could have looked far nicer had those been good ole handcrafted artwork than computer-designed stuff.

This combination of auction and tile-laying isn't a terrible game, but it's not a very compelling one either. It's dry and overly analytical, and there aren't really all that many decisions of import to make. The auction phase also isn't particularly interesting, and the most significant tension - competition for board space - only ramps up just as the game is ending.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Production: High quality production, but the artwork is too drab for me, especially on the starting tiles, which are difficult to differentiate.  Play: It is essential for players to know what tile configurations are present in the cards for each of the three land types (see player aid section).  The auctions aren't particularly interesting, and although expanding one's plots is tactical, it is very dependent on what is available each turn.  (2+1+2) (2 plays)

This has a huge number of different mechanisms thrown in (bids, tile-laying, cashflow, resource management, set collecting) with lots of decisions to make and tight parameters to work within. But it still flows along at a decent pace. Not a deep or complex game, but good quick fun.

Very much in love with the turn-order-cost system.  Makes it very interesting.  But the land development half of the game didn't feel as satisfying.  I think maybe the board is too big, so there isn't enough fighting for land space.  The only land fighting is fighting with yourself to have enough land for add-on pieces.

Players reach the New World in 1621 and start building and developing farms.  Undeveloped farms can hold ships, barns and pilgrims (all worth points and special bonuses), or they can be developed for bigger points.  The mechanics involved are very straightforward - a simple pay and play two actions.  Nice light game.

RATING: 4
Not an abject failure, yet hardly a rousing or stimulating. The game hinges on the bidding phase, yet this is the most boring and least interactive part of the game. Yet another attempt to toss a bunch of Euro mechanisms in a blender and call it a game, but where is the strategy? Where is a single clever or new concept, or an ounce of fun? Not in this box, I'm afraid.

Great game. Tense and close with interesting decisions all in a fairly short time frame. What more could you ask for? I agree it does lack that something special (fun factor or whatever) but it is still a very decent game. We tend to use this game as a filler of sorts using it to start an evening while waiting for others to arrive. I've taken my rating down from an 8 to a 7 as this game is not getting much playtime and is rarely requested.

In New England, I do like the way in which you pay the same amount of money you bid for your actions. It's an interesting way on how much you need a particular tile or card. Very good game mechanism. Deeper than I first though after playing 2 games in two days.

You want to do two specific actions and play first, let`s see some cash!

Upgrade from a 7 to an 8.

I see what people mean by a "soul-less" game as that's how I feel about this one.  It's so dry, so lacking in tension and difficult decisions, so mechanical (I do this and you do that and I do this and you do that until the game is over), that there's no fun here. Dull and soul-less.

This game is not helped by its coma-inspiring artwork, and the dry mechanics don't help you transcend the aesthetics.

Played 4 times. I really hope my opinion changes, but right now I am quite indifferent to this game. I like the auction mechanism, but I just don't find gameplay tense at all. I think this may be because I played it twice with people who were all new to the game (including myself) so maybe we didn't fight for the good items enough or understand the importance of valuing different items, but the game just felt abstract and sort of obvious. Will play again. No lower than a 5 -- right now I don't like or dislike this game. There's not much too DISLIKE, and I hope I will find more to like upon further playings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This rating may change, but is unlikely to rise.

I expected more than I got out of this game, so perhaps my rating has been affected by my expectations.

I found the game to be just ok, nothing to write home about. I have only played three players, so perhaps I missed some rule somewhere which restricts the area three players use.

The game just seemed a little dull; perhaps four players would liven it up? 

Update 02SEP05:  Played with four last night; it took some doing to get this back to the table after last time.  The game did seem better with four, but I still found it to be quite dull.  I think it could grow on me, but I can't see it lasting in my collection just on the basis I played once with four and it was alright.  I have lowered my rating of this one to a 6 - future uncertain.

We played this game at game night last night, which is one I&#039;ve been waiting for since first mentioned. Being from New England peeked my interest even more.
   It was alot of fun and one I&#039;d jump at playing anytime it was pulled out. Many choices, which makes it fun and frustrating, (in a good way) at the same time. I would highly recommend this one and since no german on the cards, it&#039;s a game you should go ahead and get. Also got great reviews from Rick T. at the Gathering, which didn&#039;t surprise me. Buy it; you&#039;ll love it. Easy play, with some tough choices and mod. time length.

RATING: 8
Rating based on about 5 playes.  After the first, I felt that some cards and tiles (15 tiles/15 cards) should be removed to create the resource scarcity that 4 player games must have.  The 3-player game with this alteration worked better, IMO.  With four players the game is at its best.  

Here is my variant: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/169366

One gripe: Why is it that the pilgrim bits supplied with the game do not match the meeple images on the cards?

Obtained in trade for my copy of Australia and found a 2nd copy in an Eastpointe, MI thrift store.

No regrets, although Australia is really not so bad.

Almost 400 years ago,the English (Pilgrims) landed at Plymouth to make a new home in a land they called "New England". You would expect a game w/ that backstory would be full of building & hunting & plowing & inviting the Indians over for lunch. The art on this games's boxtop would certainly lead you in that direction. Be prepared for  surprises: #1 the sturdy board primarily contains an 9X11 grid of plain squares, #2 the only indication on the board that has anything to do w/ New England is the splash of Fall colors on the grid's lowest side And a tiny notation of Plymouth Rock, on the top right corner, #3 there is not a savage or wild animal in sight.    So w/ that dramatic reduction in eye candy, it follows that the game would be somewhat mundane or boring. Right?......Wrong! This tense bidding game also requires  high quality tile laying skills. Plus, outcomes are not usually determined until the very end. Result: cries to play again!

RATING: 5
New England interested me for a couple games, but I've been gradually less impressed after each playing.  The coolest part is the bidding system.  There's little reason to play New England now that we have Santiago, which uses the same bidding system in a much more interesting game.  New England's central problem is that it lacks tension because the items available for purchase are too balanced.  The game should have included an aid indicating how many scoring cards there are of each color and configuration.  It plays poorly with three, and should probably be considered strictly a four-player game.  The three-player issues could have easily been solved by Goldsieber by scaling the play area and card selection to the number of players.  Not doing so is a pretty big gaffe, but then again, they're Goldsieber - we should expect this sort of thing.

This is a good game that deserves to be played more. The "bidding" mechanic that allows you to bump up your turn order by paying more per action is really interesting. I think this game was unfairly overlooked when it was released due to a lot of other good games coming out at the same time.

Rated a 6 based on the 2 player variant posted here on the geek, though played improperly.  Rather improperly.  I couldn't find it written in the rulebook what you're meant to do with the leftover development cards and land tiles until we'd finished the game.  Since we'd left them on the board (instead of removing them from the game), it limited our game dramatically as the ship cards piled up.  I think the next game will be much better, played properly.  I would even agree with the creator of this variant that it improves the game, but like he, I haven't even tried the game as it was designed to be played!

OK, marking this high after my first 2 games.  All 3 players seemed to like it, it was tense and the games were decided by 1 point in each case (with only 3 or 4 points to third place too!) Lots of money control, bidding tactics, tile/card draw shenanigans, good stuff!  Am afraid that it may decrease in enjoyment with further playings (but maybe I'm just being pessimistic...;)  Oh yeah, it's ultra short too, we played our second game without 1 reference to the rules in about 25 mins.  With this and Union Pacific Mr. Moon is heading towards the top of my game designer favourites list!  Additional: Played 2x 4 player games now too and everyone was very impressed as well (different group from the 3 player games I played).  So far this is looking very good, even the replay value is staying high!

New England is a game with relatively simple rules but it is well-themed and provides significant player interaction. The bid token mechanism is the engine of the game and works quite well. Due to the card and tile-drawing, chance plays a fairly significant role: occasionally a good scoring card can appear than only one player is eligible to use, or on the other hand a player can be waiting for a particular scoring card that never appears.

Theme did not work for me at all.  Seemed more like the Oklahoma land rush than some 100 odd settlers trying to survive their first winter in the new world.  And where were the Native Americans without whom they would never had survived a second winter?  Where'd the cows come from?  That aside, the setup allows for real problems for the players placing their start tiles last.  The different shapes for scoring in the 3 land development types is confusing, unnecessary and counter-intuitive.  If the theme is a throwaway, you can't justify it that way.  So why?  Ultimately, it ends up being to predictable.  You set yourself up to play the development cards then do small things to enhance your score and save your money until the cards you need show up.  I did not find this interesting or challenging.

Nice set of mechanics, especially like that during bidding that your bid is what you pay for tiles/cards as well as turn order, so you have the typical trade off as well as trying to out guess what your opponents will do (some of which is a given as all information is public which I also like).

Can suffer from a bit of luck... I won the last game I played (4 players) because with my most ships I twice drew an extra card that was a 6 point scoring card I could buy/develop.

After repeated plays, I find this to be a rather lackluster game. 

The more I played the more I realized how few real decisions there are to make. The only real thinking exercise in the entire game is deciding what bidding token to take and even that had little impact in the end in any of the five times I have played. You just buy the best available land/progress card. Yes, there are some choices to be made but I never felt like any of them made that big a difference. The very first time we played I felt like I was way behind the entire game and I was as surprised as everyone to find that I had won. So, I figured that I would love to play again knowing what I knew now about the game. I came into the next few games focused and fully aware of all the rules and a few strategies I had been working on. I again won the game...with the exact same score I had when it was complete luck. Ok, I figure it's a fluke. Three games later, even games I didn't win, I still get the same score, plus or minus a point. This is even after trying wildly different strategies (not that there are very many).

My choices, even when radically different, still resulted in roughly the same amount of points everytime; even when I was last every bidding round I would still end up with the same approximate points. I just never felt like any of my choices REALLY mattered.

It's not a BAD game. I just don't think it's a very good one either.

This was a great thing as I began the playing hobby. I never hesitated playing this with four, playing in 30-45 minutes with a smart auctioning system and decent quality components. The game runs quickly enough to not get repetitive. The box and board of the game, however, are way too big. They should have cut the auction and offering tracks from the board. The most important thing when considering to get NE to the table is to have four players. This is NOT a three player game. With four the board, the auction and the money management are so much tighter that it is almost a different game. The four Marker Tokens included for aiding development of land are funnily some of the most useless game components ever.

The correlation between price and turn order (the "auction" part) is nice. When it comes to preparing tile shapes, though, you're largely groping around in the dark unless you memorize the tile count and keep track of the discards. Ships don't seem too useful.

Acquired in 2004 and only played several times the first couple of years and haven't played since. The game looks nice, plays smoothly, has some strategic and tactical choices, but has no build-up.

My only question is: Why the need for 10 bidding levels in a four player game? Just in case someone is feeling sarcastic? In the games I've played, if someone really needs to guarantee that she goes first, usually it only takes a bid of 5 or 6 and then if someone wants to beat her it goes up by another one or two. If all four players are vying for control it still only gets up to 8 or so and by that time it just makes sense to count your losses and take the 1... let the other suckers pay extravagant costs because they'll most likely only be able to buy one thing anyway, giving you a nice selection. Okay, with that said, I like the game a lot. The fact that it looks beautiful with all the autumn leaves is an added bonus. I like the game much better as a four player game but it can also act as a three player friendly filler game as well. Easy to play with experienced and non-experienced and easy to teach even to younger players.

Played 3 player - a fairly light land grab game. Victory points come from various sources but mainly from collecting victory point cards and claiming land in specific shapes. Bonus abilities come from Pilgrim, Ship and Warehouse cards. The bidding system for turn order is interesting but generally punishes the first player in the round, but as this moves round all players will suffer equally. The basic turn is bidding for playing order, then in player order take 2 items (a card or tile) from a selection of 9, this is not replenished until the next turn, so the last player in a 4 player game will have a choice of 2 from 3 left available. The game can end abruptly without warning which for some people can be irritating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In some games, a number of players end up sharing the "most of" point bonuses, while in others, certain players advance far ahead early in the game, making it too hard to compete for those bonus points.  It's interesting to see how a given group will play it out.  It's also interesting how some players will hoard money and use the threat of overbidding just to make people waste money.  There are definitely some mean bidders among my friends.

The long time since my last play (and maybe some nostalgia) has increased my desire to try it out again.  The connection between order and price really is clever, though the range may be a bit large.

Excellently balanced game for 4 plyrs (usually highly difficult to runaway with the lead unless someone's asleep at the wheel). Comebacks from last to first are very possible in tight games, where it will likely come down to the wire.  Has a fabulous unique bidding mechanic I find similar to my favorite dual-usage card mechanic (which incidentally is found in Capitol which is also designed by Mr. Moon & Mr. Weissbaum).  Best with 4 players b/c the tension of board tactics is maximized...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The mechanic of bidding for turn order and then the actions costing the amount bid was intriguing to explore in this game.  The interplay of the ships, barns, and colonists intermixed with farms, villages, and industry AND the ability to cut opponents off from potential scoring opportunities presented many options on your action phase in which a person is limited to two. However, I don't ever really feel compelled to play this game nor a desire to pull it off the shelf although I would play if someone suggested the game.

I was very disappointed in this game. The gameplay is very dry and mechanical and the theme feels pasted on.  The turn order system is mildly interesting, but the gameplay just falls flat.  The fact that it is difficult to ever get a clear picture of where you are in the game (due to everyone owning similar color tiles) really detracts from the experience. Because of this game, I have completely shied away from other Eurogames that appear to be too dry.

Plays 3-4. Tile laying production game. Mildly boring with three. There isn't much tension or competition. New England has a very interesting bidding system. You bid for initiative order. High bid goes first. Your bid is also the cost per item for purchases (2 max) However the bidding is usually 3-2-1 with 4-10s being used seldomly. 

 Would like to try with 4.

The newness has now worn off and New England has completely stopped hitting the table.  The rules are clean and the mechanics are smooth, but there is simply nothing memorable about the game.

Hmm ... based on 2 plays over a weekend, I was not as blown away by this as I expected to be. I expected more resource management, and less control-of-space, but this game seems to be nearly all about getting the right tiles down in the right places, and biding your time for the point where you can bid the limit, take a 10-point scorer or maybe two 6-pointers, and then defend your lead. Not much you can do to someone who pulls this off after the fact, so you have to stop them beforehand by ... uh, getting the right tiles down in the right places.

New England is a very solid game. It's not dramatically deep but it has enough interesting decisions per turn and throughout the game to keep interest up and the biggest thing is that the game doesn't outlast its welcome. Playing with 3 is good but with 4 it's even a more crowded affair and the bidding is that much tighter as well.

Overall a fun game where you have limited choices yet gives that customary "Eurogame" feel of wanting to do several things but only able to do a couple each round.

I like that the bidding is simple yet effective. The highest bid chooses 1st but you may be able to do less if you pay a lot. The lower you bid... you get items cheaper but you may not get the "good stuff" either. One of those games where you walk the line judging what you need to do the most... and how much you are willing to pay to do so.

Overall a fun, fast playing light Euro that is probably somewhat underrated.

Good four player game from Alan Moon. Theme is based on families in 1621 New England competing for resources. Novel mechanic here is that you bid for turn order, but your bid is what it costs for each of your actions. I like this better than Amun Re and Dschunke, vaguely similar games with the VPs scored for having a particular pattern of things. But here, the scores are related to how one expands their land, with tactics, strategy, keeping one's options open to account for the different discovery cards that come up. As a stratgy game, could be Moon's best so far.

Tile/card drafting game in which players bid for turn order by selecting their price for goods. Basic, in some ways, yet the game gives you a lot to think about between its economic incentives (placing pilgrims), its ever-tightening map, and its strict scoring timing (you can't usually buy an item that you can't immediately use). Very good with 4, acceptable with 3.

I enjoyed my second playing more than my first, but the game just doesn't grab me. I'd gladly play if it's requested, though. I would like to see this auction mechanism used in a game that accomodates 6 players (or more).***Update 2/25/04*** This game has grown on me with additional playings. As to my wanting to see the mechanism used again, it works beautifully for up to 5 players in Santiago, one of my new favorites.

A game that time may have passed by. Some interesting decisions to be made, and it has a nice mix of abstract, indirect conflict, and auctioning, but it feels like a throwback.

Interesting auction game with many choices to make.  Can be a bit on the dry side, but that's more likely to influence how frequently it hits the table and not how you view the game.  Good competitive aspects with many paths to scoring leads to a decent balance.  Not hard to teach, and it won't take lots of plays to understand how to do well.

RATING: 6
Cannot say I really enjoyed this game. You select a coin value, which determines you turn order and then pay that much to take up to three actions. You build up the territory and then try to get the right card to develop the area and gain points. All while trying to get people (for money), barns (to store cards) and ships (to get an extra card or tile each turn). But the game does not seem to flow well and the barns are almost a waste as the game is short. The highest coins are also never used as they give you so few possible actions, since it costs you that much per action.

RATING: 6
In this game you bid on draft order, with which you can draft either tiles to put on the board, cards to score certain groups of tiles, or other cards that make your tiles useless but give you other benefits like extra income for bidding.  This is very much a "right place at the right time" sort of game, as you want to have the right tiles and enough to bid high when scoring cards (which were not as common as I would've thought) came up.  It being a once-around bid, turn order is a huge factor as well.  I didn't particularly like this game--it seemed difficult to really have much control over what happened.

Gameplay was probably tainted by the very slow pace. All 4 of us were 1st time players. Have not played since.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First play with 4, and I can't imagine it would be better with 3 as there would be less tense competition for resources. Nice dilemmas whereby ships on your coastal plots may give you the chance to draw another tile/card but at the cost of reducing plot size i.e. less vps. Changing turn order and tile/card draw can screw you, as well as other player's tile placements. Bids dictating cost of your actions is novel. What is up for bid is (interestingly) made variable by the 1st turn player. What to bid means assessing the needs of each player, taking into consideration their spatial situations, which can bring the pace down but at least evaluation happens almost simultaneously. But here again your score is fractured and if a scoring track was added this would made the game more exciting and would have upped my rating.

The game has some nice mechanics but just has no soul.  It is very dry and the theme could be anything.  The 4 player game is much better than the 3 player game as there is a struggle for space.

Auctions, claiming territory and a constant shortage of money. The best feature is the much-lauded bidding mechanic. It definitely elevates an OK game into good game territory.

Finally got around playing this one. I wasn't too excited. The art is clip-artish but the theme fits well.

This is a somewhat interesting tile-laying game.  I like the "auction" for turn order, though I think there are way too many options.  I think this choice of position is really the most important part of the game.  Once this choice is made, you get to choose what you will do, which will depend on what is left for you on your turn.  These choices, though, are not all that interesting.  So not too bad, not too good.  [03/13/2011]

RATING: 7
New England -- Played once; four-player.  

Not unattractive (as images of the game had led me to expect).  Bidding is perhaps the most distinctive element.  One bids for tokens which determine both play order and per-item-cost (with higher numbers going first).  But allowing the start-player to determine the ratio of Land Tiles to Development Cards available for bid is also a rather distinctive element.  Play options were tight, due to the requirement that players may only place figures (Pilgrims, Ships, and Barns) on undeveloped land.  Furthermore, a player can only develop land unoccupied by figures.  Developed land can bring in more victory points, but the figures offer functions which are practically necessary for advancement in the game.  While Pilgrims and Ships can be relocated to other unoccupied land, barns cannot, making their placement (and the placement of the land they will occupy) particularly strategic.  Of course, because a player may only purchase and use two items (Land Tile and/or Development Card), every action required a level of strategy.  Ours is a slow-playing group, but we still finished in less than 90 minutes.

The game features typical Moon/Weissblum elements: auctions and variable turn order but also features some new ideas: tile laying, scoring with ships, barns, pilgrims, etc.

Though the theme of the game of the game (settling the land in New England) works, the game flows along TOO smoothly. So much so that it becomes a rinse and repeat processional affair.

An obviously well playtested game but it may be too smooth sailing for some (not many hard choices to make).

A fun, light, easy going game that is not entirely without tension. The auction system is interesting and works best with four players. Then again, even with four players, the full 1-10 range is underutilized. I think New England is a good transitional game for new gamers, about midway between Carcassonne and Puerto Rico. I like the Autumn colors, but why don't the meeples match the pictures of the meeples?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the auction mechanism and the dilemma concerning adding infrastructure or cultivating, but I dislike the settlement cards:  the difficulty in making long term strategy and the fact that you really should know what the cards are and how many are left makes a clean game a little chaotic and fiddly to me.  However, with more playings and experience this problem may fade away.

  Terrific game; one that is more easily and readily explained than discerned from the rules. It possesses the delicious agony of tough decisions at every turn, followed by the necessity of living with your choice as its consequences play out on the board. It takes a while to grasp the visual architecture of the developing tiles and the way it affects the quest for Victory Points, but once you've figured it out (one game is all it takes), you're up, running and competitive. You get anxious quickly for another "go" at it. Rating could rise with further play.

Abstract, ameri-trash w/ pasted-on theme.  Has some nice components, attractive artwork, and an auction system 1-10 which determines turn order but also player's cost for acquiring land tiles and production cards.

Enjoyable game.  Interesting auction mechanic in this one as the highest bidder gets to go first, but also pays more than the other players for each action.

Having two turns of cards and markers face up so that you can see the next turns offerings and plan for them may make this one more platefull for me.  I know I am in the minority but I am getting tired of the mechanic.  Wait till this round, see what resources are availbe and do the best you can.  

There is forward planning but that is minimal.  All there is that I see is making sure you ahve the board location to build what you want.

I really would like to see another funkshlaug or Civilization, Britaniz, 21830, Titan.  These games where luck is truley minimized and advanced planning over MANT turns is recognized as a useful game mechanic.

"Elasund Lite" is how I describe this game, even if there are many mechanics dissimilar between the games.  It just feels like a lighter and faster version of Elasund.  That's not a bad thing or mark against either game.  In fact, I like having a game like this that can play in 60-90 minutes but with interesting decisions.  Have only played with 4 and suspect you need to remove some tiles with 3 players.

This fits with Tikal and Torres for me in the following category:

Games that are better than I rate them but are simply not as good as other 3-5 player, 1-2 hour strategy Euros.  

Basically, I feel that 3-5 player, 1-2 hour strategy euros are like power hitting first basemen.  There are a ton of them and they are all pretty good, so you really need to stand out in order to make the hall of fame at that position.  

As such, I enjoy it when I play, but see no reason to play this over... well Princes of Florence in this case.

New England demands a delicate balance of keeping undeveloped tiles for useful stuff like Pilgrims, Ships and Barns, and developing tracts of tiles for Victory Points. Because Land Development needs to follow a particular configuration, it is entirely possible for someone to screw someone else over by placing his tiles over land that his opponent will need to develop his land. 

The Bidding Token mechanism is a refreshing balance of spending more to get what you want, or spending less to buy the dregs that other players have left behind. All in all, I find New England to be a well thought-out game that rewards forward planning and prudent money management.

17-Jul-10: Played a lunch game of this with the guys. Now that I'm more aware of the limited number of land configurations there are in the deck, the number of viable options in the game seems to have diminished, given that developing land is the primary way to earn VPs. Have decided to put this on the trade pile.

There are a lot of little things I like about this game. The best is the bidding/cost coin part. I like that pilgrims and boats can be moved, but sometimes getting a place to move them can be difficult. Then realizing that you were too eager to develop some tiles.

Need to find a way to have 3 players feel as constricted as 4 players.

After a recent playing I find that I still enjoy the game, but don't have a real urge to play it a lot. Probably because it's "I extend my green area to block your brown area. Our green areas can't touch" kinda game. I've found others like that which I enjoy more (Reef Encounter) so I get my fill of the type of game from those. However, the bidding mechanism is still a reason to play it.

Maybe it's the drab theme, or perhaps the corresponding bleak color scheme.

While some of my friends find it too dry and unoriginal, I really enjoy this game.  While the theme isn't particularly compelling, and the pieces aren't especially attractive, I like the unassuming nature of this game.  It seems rather subtle for a Moon game, with layers that you'll discover as you play more.  Plus the pilgrim, barn, and boat meeples are especially cool.

The game is dry. Very dry and theme just does not work. Exactly the same comments and criticisms as other gamers. With three players, flow of game was fast, which is a plus, but competition was thin and the oomph factor just was not there. Drawing last tile or card to end game just does not work.

Very nice game with some interesting choices.  It has a unique bidding mechanic that combines price and turn order as one so that you raise the price of your own items if you want to go first.  I enjoyed the game, but it wasn't a "must buy" until I picked it up for $10. (Played with TSG)

I played it again with the regular group, and it fell flat.  I still think the mechanics of the game are good and well balanced, but for some reason the game fails to interest me.

Auction driven tile placement game that intrigues me to no end. Simple enough to understand but, putting it all together to create a winning strategy is another thing entirely. Interaction level is solid. Between placement and purchases, someone is always in your way! While good with three, I think that it really works better with four. 
Hopefully people will play this more than once before passing judgement. It really gets better everytime we play it.
Also, gotta love those Goldsieber production values!

Bland and uninspired.  The twist for this game is the auction/action buying system, but it's not granular enough to make it really interesting.  Most of the time, everybody takes the lowest stuff they can, because money's simply too tight.   I didn't find this game very compelling, nor did the rest of my group.  It's rather abstract and dry.  Might be the type of game that I would enjoy it more if I played it more, but it's hard to make a case for any game that fell so flat in three different plays.

I got this from Funagain long before I knew that there was a ThoughHammer (my FOGS of choice). Games Magazine rated it #1 so I picked it up. After finding BGG and reading some of the reviews it didn't sound like anything I could teach my family so it sat in the box. It's still there because by the time I hooked up with all the gamer friends that I have now I've got many games that I would rather play so this one may never hit the table.

Anyone who likes Alan Moon's designs is almost sure to like this game: it's very typical of his designs.

An archetypal Eurogame: 45-60 minutes, easy to learn rules, money management, light conflict to control area, more intense (yet abstract) conflict when bidding for turn order, bonus points for having the most of something. Very good for introducing newcomers to Eurogames due to the simple rules. Better with four players than three as there's more competition in bidding and for land.

Auction style game laid on top of a tile placing game laid on top of a cardgame all wrapped up with some sticky wickets.

RATING: N/A
There are three types of land in the game, land for settlements, land for crops, and land for animals. Every round, players bid to buy more land, to build cities, to plant crops, and to graze herds. There are also ships to buy and Pilgrims to entice to your land. You need money for everything of course, and you never have enough!

This has been one of my most played big games this year, and it's become one of my favorites. It is at heart a very simple design, which makes some people call it "flat". Yet the tile placements are crucial, your bidding choice is crucial, and your decisions will make or break you in a hurry. These are the Pilgims for goodness sake, how flashy and showy would you expect them to be? Perhaps my favorite Alan R. Moon game, (it's neck and neck with Union Pacific).

Well, that last sentence isn't accurate anymore, with Ticket To Ride and Incan Gold moving ahead of this and Union Pacific.

hmmm.as usual, I initially rated this game higher than I think it's real worth. There's nothing here that is particularly exciting here (much as many of the games in 2003). Although the game mechanic bidding aspect is original, and the game seems to work fine...there's nothing that makes it stand from the crowd. Also, I hate the artwork. Looks like they went down to some old pioneer village and got everyone photographed in them old duds! blech...Also the type is ugly on the cards. I think if there was possibly more thought into the art and design of this game could be what may have helped lift it from what I think is an average game thus far. 06/2004 ratings have dropped 2 points as no plays requested from it...
06/2005 after another play, we are all agreed there *is* something to this game. The bidding mechanic, various strategies..(money, barn..shipping..land placement). we all had a pretty good run with this. I'm going to bring it up to a 7! UPDATE: brought it back down a notch..just doesn't get enuf plays, gfx still very ugly IMO, although i like the board.

RATING: 7
Lost in a steady stream of game releases, this one is sadly overlooked.  Even now, I wonder why I don't play this more often.  

Positives:

It's short and easy to explain.  As a bonus, it also has a fresh auction system.

There are multiple opportunities for strategy, interaction, and hosage, including: (1) in the "advanced" game, players choose their starting locations, (2) the starting player (which rotates from round to round) can strategically choose the relative number of tile and development cards up for auction to minimize the possible benefit to others, and (3) players can intentionally expand their land developments near other players' holdings, thereby preventing future scoring opportunities.

The negatives:

For the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the game, the bidding system tends to degenerate into the same low numbers (1-4) being chosen every round. Only towards the end, when cash is more plentiful, do the higher bid tokens typically get chosen.  That's not enough to spoil the game for me, but I can see where it would annoy others.

Also, New England is only worth your time with exactly four players.  Any fewer and you're asking for a snoozefest.

RATING: 8.5
A lot of strategy in a 45 minute game. Players bid to acquire new land tiles to expand their settlements or development cards, to turn their settlements into victory points. Your bid determines both your turn order and your cost per resource. In addition to the land development, you may acquire: pilgrims, which get you more money,  barns, which allow you to store cards for play later, or ships, which give you more tile choices... but playing these pieces ties up valuable land space and prevents it from being developed.  Tough choices and quick play make this a favorite of mine.

The neat play order value as the tile cost aside, I've found New England to be mostly a procedural game where nothing surprising ever happens.  Round to round one basically try to pay as little as he can for the lands while saving up to get first pick for the big scoring developments.  Pilgrims seem to be particularly more useful than ships or barns since their reward is immediately felt after every turn, rather than situational as in the other two choices.  Average gameplay results in a mediocre experience.

I like it...and it's neat to experience the mechanism where "if you want it, you're gonna have to pay".  Still, not a whole lot here clamors for me to play it again (based on 3 playings).  Not when there are other...more interesting...games that are able to hit my table.

My first variable board, hidden turn-cycle strategic war game. Plays like a much lighter version of risk. Glad I own a copy!

RATING: 7
Rating is for the short game. Lots of cool stuff here - a modular board (before Settlers); differing strategic/production terrain values (before Vinci); and best of all - the random number of turns and random turn order, which adds a whole new dimension. OK, there are issues - kingmaking, luck, balance of the tiles, elimination - all of which would, I imagine, grate considerably in the full length version, but we had fun playing the shortened game.

The game that started my infatuation/obsession with games. Played it 25 times before i had a win in my sights only to be cheated by an opponents incredible luck with the dice. 
Game is Risk in a grid with event cards. Played it many times over the years, and it has never disappointed.

Great game, I think it's a very underrated game.  The board looks a bit like "The settlers of catan", but the gameplay is more like "risk".  It's a game where you need some luck, but it's one of those better "luck games".  I like it, especially for a game designed in the 80's.

I didn't care much for this ... admittedly, there are some cool ideas - the variable turns are good, and the event cards both work well and how they come out is neat. BUT, the game is still just Risk, i.e., it is decided not by skillful play generally but by diplomacy/whining, and who is beat up less on the last turn. Also, how the board layout ends up is huge, as the tiles themselves are not really balanced - high tactical values are also the highest levy values, so the best tiles are the most defensible. All in all, if you are a 12-year old who enjoys Risk, Targui will be a big improvement. If you've moved past the Risk stage of your life, Targui is one to pass on.

If you're lucky to visit Spiel in Essen, you'll notice that there are always mountains of this game to be found on the second hand market. I've always wondered whether or not I should take home a copy: it is an older title, and made by two Dutch guys too. (It was one of the last big games made by Jumbo, the company soon withdrew from the 'big' boardgame market and focused on puzzles and the like, although the occasional kid's game filters through from time to time.)

In any case, while playing the other day, I discovered that Targui is in essence a game of Risk, but now set against a background of warring desert nomads who decimate camels instead of armies. The game board is modular and therefore different each game. Movement and combat are simple: moving just takes players to a neighbouring space, while combat is a war of attrition fought with 1 D6 on each side. There are tile-based modifiers in combat which basically act as a guaranteed knock out of a small number of camels of the opponent every time the player throws his die. Support is handled through money, and money is handed out at the end of every game round based on the economical value of the tiles occupied by a player. But you only get money if your home tile is still yours. Then there is an interesting turn mechanic plus a deck of event cards which interject some randomness into the game.

All in all, the core game isn't bad and is clearly a step up from Risk. But it is all rather pointless. The rules suggest that play must proceed until a single player remains, or until a player-decided amount of rounds have been completed. There are no objectives, and that is a shame as that could have brought the game truly out into the sunshine instead of condemning it to a dark grey twilight. The only way to 'kill' a player is by amassing sufficient camels to attack and hold on to his home tile until the next economic income phase. Then he is sufficiently weakened to be vulnerable. In practice, owing to capricious dice (ergo, not a member of the Dice Done Right Club™), that leads to endless see-sawing back and forth over the same terrain with no player gaining a clear advantage over another unless they gang up for a while. There is no strategy to be had here unless you want to equate mob mentality with strategy.

In any case, the game just fell flat for me, and for once not because of the dice but simply because of its pointlesness. The game does not deserve the low rate I'm awarding it, but in its current state I will simply refuse to play it anew.

A nice enough game, but marked down by me because players can be eliminated. Your tribe has a village and some camels, and sets off to conquer areas, which can gain you money at the end of the round to buy more camels. There is a deck of hazard/gain cards and this forms part of a clever turn order mechanism. Apart from that it's basic dice-rolling to win battles. The board is made from tiles showing different types of land and the game plays well with 3 or 4 players, although even the 8 round game will take hours. Your moves are very simple, you decisions tricky, often depending on who goes first.

RATING: 6.5
Risk, but in the desert and slightly better. Although it is played with dice and has some other random elements, they are not entirely unpredictable and can be used to gain an advantage. Terrain can actually be used to swing a battle in your favour, making winning less dependent on luck and more on your positioning. Games can take a long time if everyone attacks the player in leading position (which will happen a lot) so imposing an 8 or 10 turn limit might be a good idea.

Targui is for sure a free-for-all king-of-the-hill Risk-like, with most of what that implies in terms of leader bashing and kingmaking. If that doesn't lead you to automatically dismiss it, you may find there are mitigating and even endearing elements. Eight-way movement contributes to the mobility of armies and fluidity of territory. Tactical considerations are complicated by variability in ordering and frequency of actions between reinforcements, forcing some tough choices. As usual in games of this type you need to pay attention to diplomatic relations and relative standings, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, and the game is guaranteed to end. Also, your armies are chocolate camels. Suggestions for best results: 1) Play with four if at all possible. 2) Definitely remove the 1-4 round cards, then remove four more cards at random for a short game. 3) Make sure each player has a single oasis in their homeland, and that the remaining two are not on the same border. 4) Maybe reduce the number and variability of turns in a round somewhat, e.g. by rerolling ones and fives.

Risklike game that's better than Risk...

Rulewise easy "wargame" with player elimination.
The random decision of rounds and playorder gives good turn-angst.

Played once in 2005 or 2006, before I joined BGG. Logged 1 play in 2006 to keep it from my unplayed list. Played it again in 2010 after buying hundreds of games and still liked it. Even though it's a dicegame which I'm not fond off.

NL: De betere en agressievere variant van Risk. Je bent een woestijnrover die met zijn kamelen de ander van het bord probeert te meppen. Vooral leuk omdat de speelvolgorde niet voorspelbaar is. Spannend, en nog gemaakt door een Nederlander ook!

The board is a 7 by 7 grid that is populated by randomly placed tiles of various types. Tiles have an 'economic' value (which give income at the end of a round) and a 'strategic' value (which give an advantage in combat). Starting with 10 camels from your respective 'corner' settlement, you get to move once each turn, generally to either take an empty tile or to try and take another player's tile through combat.

Combat is simply adding a die roll to the strategic value of the tile you're attacking from and removing half the camels (rounded down) from the defense tile. Defender gets a return volley if they have camels left. Repeat (if desired) until camels are gone. Attacker moves in if they win.

Some tricky decisions on whether to leave camels behind for defense, do the Kingmaker tactic of creating a huge hoard and move around causing havoc and destruction, or create a number of mid-sized hoards for creating middling havoc.

A round is randomly determined - roll a dice, each player puts that many tribal cards into a pile, add in a random event card, shuffle them up, and turn them over one by one. Each time your card comes up, you get to launch one move/attack, after which you can buy more camels into any one territory you own. After the round, each player adds up the 'economic' value of the tiles they own and get that much gold - with which to buy more camels next round.

So in a round, each player will have the same number of goes, but you don't know in what order they'll occur. They may be evenly spaced, or all in a row. So you have to plan for both.

One thing you have to be mindful of is losing your own starting settlement. This is bad - you get no income at the end of a round.

Whoever is leader is ganged up on by the others. So most of a game can be skipped and played out over the last two rounds. 

It's a big dice fest and the random turn order and event cards add to the luck. It's probably a born table-talk game.

Dutch. "Targui is a "Risk in the desert", and tuareg tribes are fighting for squares of strategic - hills, oasis - or economic - oasis, mines - value. Players use their pawns to control squares, they can attack adjacent squares, the goal is to conquer territories, fight issue is determined by die roll, with a bonus for the most numerous - all like Risk. Minor concession to politically correct, you kill camels and not men. Camels will like it. Targui is however much better than Risk, for two main reasons. First, it has a true theme, which creates a true ambiance. Even when pawns are just plastic half domes, the graphics, the story, the systems, the oasis, ergs, regs and oueds, all this make for a strong theme, which existed from the beginning of the design and was not added later like, say, in Durch die Wueste. Furthermore, some clever little mechanics make the game light, straightforward and dynamic. The board is modular - long before the Settlers of Catan - which makes every game different. The order of turn taking is unpredictable, and a player may even sometimes play two times before another one plays, and this makes for many reversals during the game. Last, the necessity to buyn armies - oh, no, camels - brings a small and light management element in the game. Despite all this, the game is so cleverly designed that it feels more simple, fast and evident than Risk." -- Bruno Faidutti

If you want a game that is just plain fun you'd be hard pressed to do better than this. Deceptively simple, great theme and a really well made game. The first race you play you'll feel the need to really slam the accelerator. After that, you'll learn to be a little more cautious and learn from the scratches that you get to keep on your boat for the next race.

New, in shrink. Not yet in my hands, but on the way.

I really enjoyed playing da pyrate's copy of the game, and sourced my own copy of this long out of print game.

The components, especially the magnificent 3 sided dice, are terrific, and the game is challenging, but very quick and easy to learn.

RATING: 6.5
Reminds of Formula Dé. The gearing system is more original than that of the car racing, and allows more control in parts of the game.
Otherwise it's simpler. A little less interesting thus, but on the other hand quicker to play.
Not very deep, tactical and strategical possibilitiesaere quite limited. Also suffers from the drawback, that teh one who gets the best start and takes the lead, is hard to catch.

Fantastic the first time we played, but now getting a bit stale. Usually at least one person rolls a poor die and ends up being forced out of the race - not a lot of fun.

Quick race game with elegant rules. This game is won by getting on those long and straight ideal lines. In this, luck is a factor. Maybe a rule to allow side-slipping instead of turning would reduce the luck level?

A decent-to-good race game.  Use of the 3-sided dice for the throttle is a nice mechanism.  Gives you a feel of inertia as you try to navigate the course.  Honestly, it's a fine race game - I'm just not a big fan of race games.  Plus, this one didn't have enough to it to make it a "must play."  Give it a shot if you like/can, but I don't think it'll rock your world.

RATING: 5
Powerboats is a simple race game.  The central mechanic of adding and subtracting three-sided dice and then re-rolling or keeping them the same is vaguely reminiscent of what Formula De achieves with a variety of polyhedrals.  It's nice that the board is modular and that buoys can be set to make more or less challenging courses.  

Some thought is required.  Yet the decisions aren't particularly interesting.  And Lady Luck can torpedo your chances with a single bad roll.  Like other commenters, I find three races altogether two too many.  As a short, light filler this just about passes muster.

Rules that can be learned in 5 minutes, surprisingly deep tactics considering it's basically all dependent on the roll of a few  three sided dice, and an absolutely fun experience. As a race game for me it is second only to Formula D, but much easier to bring to the table for non-hardcore gamers.

Someone brought this game, which he had been looking for two years. It racing with powerboats in a lake made up of hexes of water with small random island in it. Players will have to round various per-determined boats to make a circuit. Your speed is determined by three-sided dice (IIRC, they're 4d with one side sanded off). You can choose to add or subtract one dice, and then role any number of dice. There is actually a bit of strategy in this game, as you really have plan your direction and speed carefully. Somebody comment it feels a bit like what a space exploration. It's fun, but I don't know if it worth that time and effort ...

Essen '08 release, but didn't buy.  Played subsequently and very pleasantly surprised.  Much better than expected.  Good fun manoeuvring the boats.  For a single play I think the crash rules need mitigating.  Maybe you just loose your dice.  Restart with a '1', and go from there?  Nice game for non-gamers.

My favorite beer & pretzels game.  Buy at least one copy of the expansion to add some variety to the races.  The modular board + the expansion means you'll never race the same course twice.

My only criticism is that they should have included 3-4 extra dice.  In 6-player games we usually have a couple people run out of dice.

RATING: 9
Combines the best parts of Formula De (dice rolling, risk management) and Bolide (low luck, finding the best "line"), with few of the shortcomings of either game.  It's a shorter game, player turns are very quick, and you aren't limited to two tracks out of the box -- there's a nice variety in the modular board.  This is absolutely a keeper.

This gets compared a bit to Snow Tails because they came out same Essen.  While Snow Tails introduces some new ideas, Powerboats is an evolution (and, for me, almost a perfection) of older racing game ideas.  If people want a racing game, I usually direct them to Powerboats, unless they're looking for something a bit different or "gamery", then it's Snow Tails.

Besides Snow Tails, this is the best race game I have played, Snow Tails does it with cards, this one with dice.

The push your luck factor here is very interesting and quite a few times you even don't roll your dice. I love how even playing with 6 players there is almost no downtime between turns. The dice gear mechanic is wonderful.

Unfortunately Teresa didn't like it at all. So I traded it to my buddy Jokin.

Fun racing game,rather than a serious racing game, if there is such a thing. The neat "add or remove dice, keep or re-roll dice" mechanic is basically all you need to know to play the game. Still, there's a risk-reward balance to strike and if things go wrong, it tends to go really, really,awfully badly wrong. Which is usually very funny indeed.

I'm not a fan of racing games with dice, but this one has some PROS: A) cool 3-siders  B) the ability to keep rolls for turn after turn  C) the requirement of only 1 die up or down.  I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this one to someone who has not yet tried it.

I'm sure people who like Formula D (and the original Formula De) will love this. I don't like those games and I don't like this one either.

It really boils down to rolling the right dice at the right time, or not rolling the wrong dice at the crucial point.

For me an oddly unpleasant mix of frustration mixed with apathy when I play. Much prefer other race games such as The Mississippi Queen, Ave Caesar, Snow Tails ...

I really don't like Mississippi queen, snow tails, or Formula De, all games that share similarities with this one.  They are a little too complicated for what's at the core a very simple racing concept.

I think powerboats is probably the best of the genre alongside Ave Cesar.  Powerboats is braindead simple, yet has some minor elements of tensions and risk.  It also plays quickly.

I can't imagine playing the recommended 3 rounds in one sitting, but playing one round every few months seems like a good time to me.   Initial rating a 7.

Sweet, I'm a huge fan of racing games, and this one really offers something different!

The movement system is simple, yet pretty awesome, as you can either keep the dice from your last turn or decide to re-roll any number of them, while also having the option to add or subtract one die from your pool of movement dice each turn.  It gives you a much higher ability to plan ahead than almost any other dice-roller racing game, as you're often looking 2 or more rolls ahead.

The modular system is extremely awesome, with thousands and thousands of possible board set-ups from race to race.  I would say it's likely impossible that you would ever race the same course.  All in all, an extremely good racing game that is nearly my favorite game in one of my favorite genres.

RATING: 8
This game gives more control than Formula De (the only other dice racing game that I have played) while using a similar mechanism.  Additionally, in my experience Powerboats plays much faster than Formula De which gives it an edge over it in my opinion (unless you are a F1 fan.  Im not).

Powerboats can be taught in less than 5 minutes and an individual race with four players who have played even once before can be played in 10 minutes. No exaggeration here, it is literally that quick.
This really helps to make the game feel like it is an actual race, rather than a drawn out experience watching people counting spaces (like Formula De can sometimes be).

Obviously there is luck involved but there are some decisions to make, enough in fact to keep it engaging for the short play duration.

A thoroughly recommended quick filler racing game.  A great frame to build customised elements (guns, ramps, mines etc) into too if you are that way inclined.

The last couple of months have shown that I actually like racing games. Not that I love them, but I like them more than I would have thought I would do. However, whereas I liked Das Motorsportspiel, Asteroyds, RoboRally and Ave Caesar, Powerboats fell flat.

The first round was pretty funny, but after that round it’s exactly the same you do in the next two rounds… Of course, the buoys are placed in different places along with the starting/finishing line, but it is still the same concept. It’s different than Ave Caesar and Das Motorsportspiel as it is three separate minigames (without the time element of RR and DM), and I don’t think this concept is suited for a game with a playing time of an hour. It’s simply too repetitive. Furthermore, to me, the scoring system doesn’t work. In our game, the last placed player after the two first rounds (he still had 0 points), were actually capable of winning the game if everything worked out if I remember correctly… This seemed rather odd; yes, it’s a catch-up mechanism, but still! What’s the point that you can play very well in the first races and lose everything in the last simply because it grants so many points compared to the first two races?

I did find the mechanic about how you speed up and down depending on which dice you keep/add/discard neat! You cannot just accelerate a lot or decelerate; the speed depends somewhat on what you did in your previous turn. As you can keep your previous rolled dice, the luck is somewhat mitigated, which is great, but luck is definitely present. Maybe the game would have been better if you just played a single race, but on the other hand I guess it would lose something else, and the game could definitely be decided by chance or unfortunate circumstances. It was rather easy not to crash, and even if you did, I cannot imagine anybody would actually crash completely out of the race.

Because of the too repetitive gameplay (compared to the length), Powerboats wasn’t a hit. I do suspect the game will be better with more players as I guess more players = more chaos = more fun (as in Das Motorsportspiel and other racing games).

Recommended only for players who thrill at the idea of rolling amusingly shaped dice.

Powerboats is a medium weight racing game that has drawn inevitable comparisons to Snow Tails because of its Essen 2008 release date.

Powerboats takes place on a large hexagonal board. The goal is to race around a number of buoys and to be the first one back to the finish line. You accrue points over a series of three races and the highest score wins.

The board in the game is semi-modular (modular, but big chunks) and the starting line and location of the buoys can be changed up for each race pretty easily. The action is all dice driven, and the dice are odd pseudo-3 sided dice (3 sides in that they have 3 numbers they can land on, not in that they have rounded edges to facilitate their 3-sided-ness rather than defying the laws of 3 dimensional space...pity) that change the speed of the boat.

Play is fairly straight-forward: on your turn you choose to either keep the same speed you have, add an extra die, or subtract a die. You can always re-roll the current number of dice you have, or keep some of the ones that are already rolled and re-roll some of the others. You can then rotate the boat one hex side and then move it straight forward for its full movement allowance. This movement scheme is effective in the game, because it often forces extremely sub-optimal moves into the hinterlands which we have taken to calling trawling. The movement is completely bizarre in that it makes your powerboat feel like it is steering like an ore ship with nitro boosts though, but it makes for more compelling play than an appropriately manoeuvreable boat would, so I can't blame them. 

Going too fast can mean that players end up having to shoot off into the weeds to keep from crashing, which can lead to some amusing slow turning and recovery. Sometimes, even turning into the weeds won't be enough, and the boat crashes. Doing this 3 times will take you out for the race, and some damage will carry over to the next round of racing as well.

If I have any qualms with this game, it is mainly the scoring. The first race is just worth normal points (i.e.: 4 players: first gets 4 points, second 3 points and so forth) but then the next race is worth double, and the final is worth triple. So basically, your first race performance is useless. If I played this with 3 races again, I would probably suggest flat scoring, because otherwise the first race is just for amusement. Another, better option that we've started using is just playing this as a one race filler type game. The game mechanics seem better suited to this than the 3 race system and I prefer to play it this way.

Overall, I like the game. It has an odd feel, and the 3 race set is a bit much for my tastes, but it's enjoyable enough, and pretty variable because of the ways the boards can be reconfigured. I'm not crazy about the amount that the game relies on timely rolls, but even having to go off into the boonies can be amusing ("Out trawling again Tony?"), so I won't harp on the point too much. For my tastes, Snow Tails is a better game, and is certainly the title I would want to play more often, but this isn't a bad choice if you're crazy about race games and need another medium weighter. Definitely better as a one race filler than as a three race main event though.

It's a die rolling race game. It's okay, but not great. Do not use the scoring variant even for a two-player game. It's annoying to keep up with, and it makes the loser feel very defeated and dislike the game even more.

Wow. Maybe my favorite racing game night now. I really like how even with 6 players it's not crowded, because people can go all sorts of different ways. And people are passable. But there is player interaction in that you can't stop where another player does. But that's it, so people are definitely playing for themselves, and not attacking other players. Love the speed control. And love the risk for trying for the right spot, and having to go the wrong way if it doesn't work, or blowing up. Loads of fun.

The problem I found was that it seemed that to weave between the islands, rolling exactly the number you needed was often critical, one over or one under could result in crashing into an island or having to stamp on the brakes such that you lose vital momentum.

Powerboats is one of the best racing games around. It's fast, furious and fun, but at the same time very tactical and not as dependent on luck as one might expect at the first glance. The rules can be explained in 60 seconds, which is almost a trademark of Cwali games - simple rules, interesting gameplay. If you are even a little bit interested in racing games, this is an absolute must.

RATING: 7
Players race powerboats around various courses.  Nicely presented game, where players roll dice to set their current speed.  Acceleration and deceleration is nicely handled by adding or subtracting one die per turn.  Dice can be held at their current results (to maintain present speed) or picked up and re-rolled to potentially change speed.  Really elegant system... and the D3 dice are nifty!  Overall, quite a simple game to play, very easy to explain and takes about 30 minutes to play all three races.  It reminds me a lot of Mississippi Queen, with the wheel taken out and the dice inserted.  Very good race game.

My favorite racing game, as well as my favorite Corné van Moorsel design. The player can actually manage how much "luck of the dice" is involved, and although it's possible to roll lucky and win, superior skill manages to win more often than not. I can't point to any flaws in this brilliant design.

One three player game (probably not ideal; more seems better).  I did enjoy the movement mechanic but the scoring seemed unsatisfying in that it was too strong in the last round, and everyone agreed that some scoring opportunities during the race would be interesting.  I look forward to the new expansion tiles that add new elements to game play.

Very fun, light and quick racing game. Some nice dice management possibilities, I like the opportunity to not have to reroll them every turn but just keep them instead. This gives the game a nice balance between some light planning and luck. I also like to possibility to build your own courses, high replay value. 

Didn't play this for a long time as the artwork isn't that exciting (as with most Cwali games) but the game underneath is (as always with Cwali) pretty solid. This has become a hit in my group now. Very happy I (re)discovered this accessible little gem.

My first play of Powerboats was a fun one. Like the d3s too. As of now this is my go to racing game. 

My favorite part about Powerbutts is the route finding nature of the game. Pretty much every other racing game I've ever seen has a preset race course, how you get there is by staying on the track. There is no track in Powerboats. How you find the best route is up to you, and with different speeds, the true 'optimal' path is subjective, and very difficult to find, and if the dice do not decide to cooperate you're back to square one.

I've taught this a few times, but we played a full three races for the first time today. Great fun, very fast as you pick up the tactics. Even poor dice rolls don't hamper good decisions. The courses are so unpredictable, that good numbers on this turn are bad numbers on your next move. We only thought in the last race to drop speed to zero and pivot one face on the spot. This would have secured me a few more points, but not the win. Fun fun fun, and it works much better than most racing games.

Looking at this game as I passed it during Essen 2008, I was in two minds about it.  It looked too much like something governed by semi-controllable random factors.  However the designer has clearly got the level of control correct whilst allowing risk and reward.

Being a race game I was a little wary of the theme too, but it's quite a brilliant tactical game regardless of theme.  I think this could be deserving of a nine after a few more plays.

Powerboats is a race game similar in style to Formula D/Dé. On the plus side, it offers a bit more control since you can use multiple dice that you don't even have to reroll if you don't want to. On the negative side, however, it lacks the opportunities for blocking or slip-streaming. While rolling too high in Formula D often means you'll just spend a brake or tyre point to keep on track in Powerboats it often results in dropping out of the race completely because you have to use up all movement points if you can, even if that means going in the opposite direction of where you wanted to go. There's pretty much no comeback from such a situation.

This makes Powerboats a much more defensive game; taking risks is rarely a good idea. So while the game makes the dice rolling a bit more manageable it also lacks some of the excitement of a race.

Excellent game with ease of play. A very ingenious use of the dice for controlling the speed of your boat. I might even of considered giving this game a 10 if it weren't for the flimsy gameboard pieces. One of them were torn already when I opened it, and the way they fold it doesn't seem like they will last too long. Also I had to glue the buoys to keep them from falling apart. Other than those few issues this is really a fun game. It is awesome to see all the different approaches to the next buoy and then to see someone have to dart off in the wrong direction due to speed is priceless. Especially at the finish line lmao.

Oh and it has 3 sided die. That's original in itself.

RATING: 7.5
I love the way the dice are used in Powerboats. You've got a pile of 3-sided dice. Each turn you can keep the same number of dice or add or subtract one die. In any case, you can keep some or all of your dice rolls from last round, and reroll the ones you don't like. This makes it possible to plan several turns ahead because you know you have certain numbers locked in. It also allows you to manage your risk based on how well positioned you are in the race. If things aren't going smoothly, you may want to reroll a lot of dice or make risky moves.

The only thing I don't like about Powerboats is the scoring system. I prefer to score all races equally, with ties broken according to order of finish in the final race. This makes the first race more meaningful, at the expense of a greater likelihood of someone being out of contention before the final race. I also think two heats is enough for most groups, rather than the suggested three.

I don't understand the popularity of this game. You get in boats and drive around a track with no extra cards to do anything interesting. Just you and adjusting your speed and trying to not get stuck in a clump of weeds.

As you can surmise from the name, Powerboats deals with racing fast boats.  Fortunately, more than the type of object being raced is different, as the game does involve a clever system of adding and removing dice to regulate movement.  Is that alone enough to make the game substantially different from the dozens of other games in the genre, thereby making it worthwhile to keep?  Sadly, I don’t think so.

I am disappointed that Powerboats did not generate more excitement.  The designer has invented some very clever and original games that usually contain some highly interesting mechanisms or twists.  While the dice mechanism here is different, the remainder of the game feels all-too-familiar.  That’s disappointing.

This is a good game although I don't agree that the 2nd and 3rd race should be worth more than the 1st.  I understand that this artificial catch up mechanism is there to help players feel like they're still in it if they aren't competitive in the first race but I just don't care for it.

I think Race games just aren't my thing so this is destined for a trade.

Very impressive design - gives the feeling of boats, the momentum and turning circle, with very very little rules overhead. Positioning very important, one hex off can be important, and managing dice to get the right line is interesting, but not overwhelming.

I don't think I would want to play 3 courses like the rules suggest, 2 feels like a more reasonable length.

Corne van Morsel has to be the master of making games that have an incredibly old school aesthetic to them while still feeling fresh.

Another excellent game by Cwali. People compare it to Mississippi Queen and certainly there are elements of that but this game is a totally different beast.

Played a second time (17/01/09) and it wasn't as fun as the first time.

Interesting solo puzzle game.  Definitely a system on the best way to race the course that I did not figure out, but can see it now. Not sure if all the players were experienced if it would not come down to simply who rolled the best dice.  Unfortunately there is really almost no player interaction here. This is what is keeping it from being a good racing game even if it only had short term appeal.

Rating is based partly on the online version playable at mastermoves.eu. There it is only a 2-player game which is a lot of fun. However, with 2 players a winner is  at most times decided at the first buoy. The board game offers more fun, especially with more players as the board is much more crowded.

My one play of this was a good finisher to a big day of heavy games.

It worked well for that purpose but I won't seek it out again.

Afterwards, we discussed the idea of some simple rules for mounting machine guns to our boats.  That's a normal thing to think about, right?

There were a couple of things I really wish were different in the rules, namely the part about if you can avoid crashing you must.  Rather than take 1 damage I had to go the entirely wrong direction and practically lose the race.  But, overall, it was a good racing game.

A fun little dice-based race game with good replayability. I wouldn't play the recommended 3 race series as that makes things go on far longer than such a simple system calls for. Lots better than the similar Formula De as the track isn't fixed and a race is done quicker.

This has to be close to my favourite racing game. Just like Streetsoccer, there is a deceptive amount of meaningful decision making that decides the game more than the luck of the dice. I don't like the sound of the scoring system but you don't have to use it - either use equal scores in each race or just play each race as an individual game.

RATING: 5
This is a boat racing game in which you can increase and decrease the number of dice you use, adjusting for speed and trying to get around islands.  It's pretty good at what it tries to do, I guess, though I  haven't played Formula De and suspect that's probably more interesting.  For some reason, this game is played in three rounds.  I really don't see the need for more than one.  Even within a round, it kind of drags once people start crossing the finish line. (1 play)

One of my favourite racing games. It uses a unique three sided die system to simulate momentum and determine how far your boat will move on each turn. The result is that players often take different routes in an attempt to be first. Excellent design although it is sometimes tough to catch the lead boat. Usually best to let three races determine the winner. TOP#9

27/05/12 Met Evert DG en Ward; met powerboats om het snelst in de juiste draaizin om boeien en over de finish varen op hexagonaal watergrid met eilandjes. Trage wendbaarheid en acceleratie-effecten worden verrassend goed gesimuleerd, waardoor je geregeld ongewild uit koers geraakt. Verschillende spelborden mogelijk; elke ronde worden de boeien willekeurig geplaatst. Tof, snel en gemakkelijk spel.

Goed spel voor Pepijn (6j)! (al is verliezen soms nog lastig)

Two plays only. Fun racing game with a decent amount of replayability through the configurable board set up. First game ran a little long for what it is - we only played one race which people enjoyed but we didn't really want to play more (the rules suggest a 3-race tournament), second game a lot quicker.

You need to watch excessive speed - slow(er) and steady is likely to prove more successful (if a little less fun!) than flat out everywhere

Confirmei o que tinha lido. Este jogo é refrescante. A mecânica é simples mas original. Tem uma longevidade assegurada e parece-me ser capaz de pôr a jogar mesmo aqueles que não são muito dados a este tipo de entretenimento. A competitividade que fomenta é salutante, sem prescindir de uma sensação de liberdade que é facultada ao jogador. É um dos bons jogos de corridas, do qual certamente não irei prescindir de ter comigo. Não dá que pensar muito, mas dá pano para mangas. Dada a pouca utilização e eu não o querer vender, diria que é um jogo de culto. Recomendo.

Un juego de carreras bastante original, que aunque se resuelve por medio de dados, sí que se puede tener el control de tu velocidad en gran parte.

Tus dados indican tu velocidad, que se mantiene a lo largo de los turnos, salvo que se modifique. Cada dado tiene una puntuación de 1 a 3 casillas, y en cada turno puedes volver a lanzar una vez los dados que quieras, o bien añadir un dado o bien quitar uno.

RATING: 7
Fun race game with unique dice, and an interesting push your luck mechanism as you roll a number of dice based on your current 'gear'. Messing up and running aground will frustrate and aggravate you, and will grant an advantage to experienced players who know when and where to down shift on their turn. Modular board setup allows for variability in race routes and adds to the longevity. While not as in-depth as Formula D, nor extendable to include as many players, Powerboats is still one of the more accessible, entertaining race games I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Having played the two-player-only online version at mastermoves a lot before and always enjoying it, I was keen to play the board version. My first live play with four players was good but it dragged a bit and I'm not sure how much the other players enjoyed it. Three races feel like too much and the increased scoring from single points in the first race via double points to finally triple points makes the last race too decisive.  The other races just feel like a long setup period. I will always use the optional scoring rule to add a point for each round you are finished before the last player comes in. Nonetheless, still one of the better racing games out there and especially for fewer players which most racing games don't handle well. It even gets better with less players.

Finally tried this after having heard so much about how great is was.

Played 3 rounds and the first was quite fun, the second was meh, while the 3rd was lets get this over with.

There is no catch up effect, if you are behind, then it is very difficult to change the status.

Heard afterwards that there is a variant that allows for blocking the other boats, not sure if that changes anything, but must try that variant the next time.

I tend to not like race games, especially ones where you have to repeat the same course multiple times.  But Powerboats is quick enough that it is interesting and worth playing every once in a while.  I like the way the dice have you locked in at certain speeds, making it harder to speed up and slow down quickly.

*Update* This game has been getting more play lately and I've been enjoying it and playing more than ever.  It really is a great game.

RATING: 1
Never have I played a game I hated so much. Well, pursuit of happiness came close. I was completely done with PB after the first practice round. I will never play this ever again unless at gunpoint.

The rules, man, the rules, the game centers around rounding buoys, right? Well, these have circles, and you are supposed to go round them, but there is NO RULE in the entire manual that describes what is allowed and what not, how far to get from the buoy and how to move. We had a huge discussion about it and in the end we got to a ruling that you had to draw a line with a pen over the board without releasing the pen from your start point to over the buoy and your boat had to be inside that -  just in order to get it going again. The designer seems to assume some prior knowledge about sailing that you are SUPPOSED to have and apply. Well, I do, but I expect from a game that the rules spell out exactly what is allowed, and good gameplay follows from that. Game rules left out by a lazy idiot designer is simply unforgivable and should not be rewarded. 

The components are lame, the game space is huge and the boats are tiny, and ugly. It looks like a game from 1960. The dice are awkward and don't add much. The boats look nice on bgg image but in reality they are dull. The scoring markers are actually different color and shape. When setting up the game you need to lay out the borders, and after first time use they already were weak and showed wear, the jigsaw ends did not fit nicely.

Then the gameplay: with 5 players (forget 6) the downtime is sooo long. And then on your turn you bump into an opponent, and cannot move. 

So: it looks like crap, your box is only air, it takes huge space, rules suck, takes forever.

I feel sorry for the tree that was killed for it.

If you are not convinced yet, take a look at his website, to see that this Corne designer has no idea about beauty: http://www.cwali.nl/powerboats/powerboats.htm

Like some parts of it but it wasn't hard to work out the best plan - then hope to roll what you need when required. don't make any mistakes and whoever gets the best start wins? 

we played the 3 races as instructed and each time the winner was the person who had the best start location - unless you mess up a move it seems like it's a procession. 

anything else to it??

Played twice, 4p, 5p, one lap each.  Racing game, better than, but clearly inspired by, Mississippi Queen.

While I enjoy the game, I do believe playing three races is overkill.  The buoys are very fiddly and a pain in the arse.  In retrospect, I believe I would recommend that you stick to two races with both races being worth the same amount for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  The increased scoring for each race in the original game makes the first race pointless.

2nd update 7.5 to 8.5; Continues to improve.  An engaging game where you have to sustain your concentration.  A race game which requires your full attention but does not overcomplicate with unecessary detail.

1st Update; Played with four and the realities of racing remain.  A good starting line is importtant and sometimes the less travelled channel is the best.  Recommend for people who like the more considered racing game (rare to say when movement is dependent on dice)

Have only played as one of three players on the 'advanced' board and found it enjoyable with enough theme and aspects of racing reality - a good racing line, controlling of speed, the importance of efficiently maneuvering around buoys and movement off the start line are all essential - which raises the game above a simple who rolls highest wins game.  In fact, on the advanced board, who often rolls lowest wins.

I think the luck of the dice can spoil things a bit, and in a given race there can be a real runaway leader problem. It's tough to play quickly as things can change radically before your next turn.

What seems like a pretty simple race game turns out to be a contest of dice rolling. You just position yourself as best you can and hope you get the numbers you need.

Formula D is a better game, but it takes longer to play. This is a good substitute when time is of the essence, and it also manages to play well with fewer players.

In my first play of this, we misread the rules, and were rolling all dice every turn (you can choose which dice to keep and which to re-roll). This had disastrous consequences as people lost control of their boats, but it was also incredibly fun. Unfortunately, with the rules as written, players sometimes become a bit conservative, going slow but steady instead of taking risks. I've suggested a variant in which at least one die must be rolled each turn, but have yet to test it.

I’m still waiting for the racing game that manages to overcome my ho-hum disposition towards this genre, and Powerboats isn’t it. The escalating speed dice are charming, but on the whole, this game failed to really grab me. Maybe the problem is that the disconnect between playing a racing game and actually racing a boat (or a car or a horse or a log raft or whatever) is so very big. This would be substantiated by my dislike for sport games. Maybe a couple of machine guns mounted on each of those boats would help matters ...

The powerboat racing theme seems to fit the mechanics of this design well.  The game looks beautiful and the numerous board configurations will really help replayability.  However, I found that the penalty for risk-taking to be too high.  A poor role can really set you off course, possibly knocking you out of the race.  Additionally 3-races seemed too long.

Very easy to play with fast player turns even at high player counts, which is impressive by itself. Variable course creation and simple rules lend themselves well to the risk management/push you luck that the strategy ultimately boils down to. Recommended.

RATING: 8
Powerboats is another racing game but with far more control than titles such as Formula D, thanks largely to the dice mechanic.

The game uses D3s and on each turn a player can increase or decrease their speed by 1 dice. The aim is to navigate around 3 checkpoints before crossing the finish line.

The soul of Powerboats is about finding the perfect racing line through the course (which is punctuated by islands) and then executing a dice strategy that will allow you to hit each mark smoothly. In this respect the game actually feels more like an abstract game than a racing game.

I love this and highly recommend the mastermoves.eu website where you can play the game online. Very addictive.

RATING: 7
Endearing race game with a novel and interesting use of the (three-sided) dice, doing a good job of conjuring up the feel of powerboat racing.  Not at its greatest with two, when the scoring feels decidedly iffy, but might work over a single race with, say, three boats each, rather than the three-race, one-boat format.

Modular two-sided boards change the difficulty and lend this maximum replayability.  Currently out of print, but worth seeking out if you like race games.

Not a bad racing game. You have to avoid taking risk all together in this game as it is pretty unforgiven. The problem of this game is common among the all racing games. Not much player interactions and there is no catching-up mechanics. Too bad because I like the system of the game.

RATING: 6
A light racing game.  Players roll 3 sided dice every turn to determine how far they travel.  Your boats cannot turn in the middle of a turn and you can decelerate or accelerate by adding or subtracting dice respectively.  A game lasts 3 rounds, don't hit obstacles and stay ahead of your opponents and you have a chance!

I would like to play this a few more times, but it does seem like an enjoyable racing game for 3 to 6.

I like the movement rules here. You roll three sided dice and you can always gain or lose one die before your turn. You can also choose to holdover any roll from the previous turn, so you can keep the same roll and have no risk if you want.

RATING: 8
First impression (4 players): It's a racing game with lots of dice. I really like the basic mechanic as you can either keep your previous roll or roll any amount of dice and/or add/reduce one die. This way you can take chances with the dice but there are times when you don't need to if you have the right dices rolled previously. 

The rules suggest playing 3 races that score increasing points in every but it also works as a filler when played for one round only. This is simply an excellent racing game, one of the best.

I gave this one a 7 to start with after my first partial game (2-player, only 1 race).  After some more racing with more people I have bumped it up to an 8.

I can see the charm of this with lots of players.  With only 2 players we may use the advanced scoring for future games.

It plays fast enough that it is almost a filler game.  Or that game you play while waiting for the full contingent of your gaming group to show up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well, this kills off Mississippi Queen. It's the same decision process - speed up, speed down - but it's a lot more fluid, there are better decisions to make and the dice make it more fun. Racing around the 3 buoys, your move is to add a die (they're d3), lose a die or stay with the dice you already have, then choose to either keep each die as it is or re-roll it, rolling any new die obviously. Each move you can only make one 60 degree turn, so rounding those buoys is gonna take a series or moves, setting up for the next straight. Lots of islands scattered around the board make it a constant decision process on whether to go faster and possibly hit something (4 damage points and you're out) or stay safe and constant with your known speed. Things can go beautifully, or go oops when you're rolling, resulting in recovery turns - but it's always your risk to assess and play. Each race is only 15 or so minutes long, with fast turns, so it works really nicely as an opener or a filler. Not sure I'd want to do the recommended 3 races each game - just play once or twice and keep it fresh for next time.

Based on one play: Like most games of the genre you roll dice to move and can re-roll or reduce (gear down) or increase (gear up) the number of dice you have. A lot of luck, a lot of frustration, but not a lot of fun. You can go save or take risks hoping for the right dice roll but at the end luck proves the determining factor. I have no issue with luck, but the game is not very fun to play.

I'm usually not a huge fan of race games, but this one was a lot of fun.  The use of 3-sided dice limits variability, which means that you can (and should) plan multiple turns into the future.  You really have to know which direction to go (unlike many race games, the map is pretty wide open) and whether you should be speeding up or slowing down, which really depends on your plans for the next couple of turns.  Being able to play well with 6 is a plus for me.  And the variable map setup keeps the game interesting through multiple plays.

Powerboats is a racing game that looks like The Mississippi Queen and plays a bit like Formula Dé. But it's quite a bit faster than Formula De, and very playable with 6 players. The official rules suggest a 3-round race, but that adds nothing to the game, as all three rounds are played the same way. Of course, playing only one race means that luck becomes more important compared to skill, but the game is light enough that I can accept that. There's still plenty of skill involved. Highly recommended, as are several of Corne van Moorsel's previous designs. He's quickly becoming one of my favourite designers.

RATING: 7
Probably the biggest surprise this year. This game is really awesome!

The board is double sided and very large. Too bad that it won't fit on just any table (for example in the coffee house). Well, anyway, the large board isn't a big downside since the game itself is just mind-blowing!
The dice system adds a luck factor so sometimes you really have to jeopardise your race and push your luck in order to win. Otherwise, that dice system is just brilliant (and the dice look better than original D6s).

The scoring system needs a bit more. The current system is just dull since a player with only last positions on two previous races can win the game on the third race just too easily by being first.
Another stupid rule is that you can't voluntarily crash. Well, ok, it must be because of some balance issues but a race can be totally ruined by the fact that you could be hopelessly out because of a single bad roll.

Ok, the bad things can be fixed. Fixed or not, this game still rocks and can really be a thrilling experience!

I like race games (simple victory condition of first past line), but so far I have not come across a design that is speedy in play. Dice rolling before you move and counting spaces as in Formula De isn't conducive to fast play befitting a race game, though Powerboats could well be faster as the movement range is only from 1 to 9. Yet for a race game I think Leader 1 may hold more promise in terms of management skills required

June 2017: Downgrade from 8 to 6. Racing board games aren't that great in general. As with many racing board games.
* End games are not dramatic
* There's player elimination that's unfortunately necessary as it gives a deterrent for those players who push their luck too much
* Next to no player interaction, which means there's little interest to pay attention to your opponents

I've never played three races in one session, as the rules suggest. One is more than enough!

I compare this to a maze game. However, like many maze games, planning a route is way more fun than actually navigating through it.

Dec. 2013: One of my favourite racing games ever! The rules are incredibly simple yet the game offers meaningful (but a bit simplistic) decisions.

Very little player interaction. However, the push-your-luck and route planning mechanisms make up for it.

I have a soft spot for this designer's games - they're deceptively simple and there's usually more to them than meets the eye - but I'm not really a fan of this kind of racing game. Neither am I at all sure about the 'play three times in a row' rule in the manner of Winner's Circle; it's justified in the latter game because of the fact that you're betting against your opponents. The scoring needs to be reconsidered IMHO.

Nicely done racing game with clever acceleration 3-sided dice system.  Nicely done modular maps and flexible race course design, plastic boats, cheesy cardstock buoys that fall apart and fall over.  We all enjoyed it but also all felt like it's not the kind of game that makes you want to play it again right away.

After my 2nd game 3 months later, I think I want to like it more than I do. The system is too catastrophic in the sense that a random difference of one die point often has huge consequences. I wonder if I'd like it more if it was a pure strategy game, in which you choose your dice rolls.

--Apr2009-- Finally found a copy.  (I'd stopped in Ashland back in December of last year, but Funagain wouldn't sell me the copy I found on their shelves because someone had already bought it on the web!  No complaint:  they behaved entirely correctly.)
As to the game, despite the fact it's a roll & move, there's a great degree to which one's destiny is decided by decisionmaking rather than randomness.
I'm very impressed with the design.  It plays very quickly (we ran through a 6 player game the other night with none of the participants finding it too slow) and there's a surprising degree of interplayer interference possible despite the simplicity.

The dice movement is a simple and clever idea in this game about speed management and manoeuvring - gosh, just like real powerboat racing. As soon as you realise that the low number dice can be as valuable as the high numbers, you'll be on your way to pulling off some tricky turns between the obstacles and avoiding the dreaded crash or going way off course. The pace is quick because on your turn you're only looking two or three turns ahead and only a misplaced opponent in your way can slow you down. Decisions are limited to whether you take the risk and pick up another dice, or roll again, or not - depending on where you stand in relation to your opponents. All in all there's more control here of your (car) boat than any other racing game I can think of.

Good entertainment value if you play one or two races for the fun of it. The game shines with the right group looking for a bit of quick fun and a bit of schadenfreude.

My copy of the game was came with no white boat and two purples, so time to take the white paint out and get to work.

RATING: 9
This is a racing game on a hex map. Each player has a boat and must take it around a set of randomized buoys and islands. Each boat has a certain speed, represented by zero or more d3 dice in their speed box. You start out, of course, with no dice. On your turn you may remove any one die from the speed box, or add a newly rolled die, or neither. You may also reroll any of the dice in the speed box; if you reroll the existing dice and add a die, you should roll them all at once. The sum of numbers is your speed and the distance your boat will travel. Before moving your boat, though, you may adjust course, rotating it 1/6th to the left or right.

You may pass other boats, but if your boat stops on a space with another boat, you must move it back along your course until you hit an empty space. You may not pass through land or buoys, and attempting to do so will knock you backwards along your course to the first empty space, remove all your speed dice, and award you a damage marker. Four damage markers and you're out of the race. First to the cross the finish line wins.

The map and random course makes each race unique. There is no one best path through the course, as the variations in your speed may make you veer a different way than you'd like to go. I thoroughly enjoyed Powerboats, despite putt-putt-putting my dinghy into last place. Looking forward to another play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's a very tactical roll and move game. After only one play there are two rules that need changing.

1. If a boat is eliminated, allow the player to start from the start line again with a new boat. It saves a player having to sit out for, what could be, most of the game.
2. If you prefer to take damage rather than go totally off course, allow it!

RATING: 9
This is an excellent, quick, fun, tactical racing game. The dice mechanism for controlling your boat's speed works very well, there's risk management involved but it gives you pretty good control, and it fits the theme extremely well; you can't stop a speeding boat on a dime so you need to think ahead about how you're going to be able to slow down and maneuver around the buoys or islands when you start adding dice to pick up the pace or catch-up to another player. Picking the better "line" is crucial, and overshooting that line can be a game breaker unless you have time to recover, so you need to take care of how fast you're going. You'll want to get some 1's down to help maintain control, and give you more options on how and when you'd like to slow down for a narrow turn, but you'll also want some 3's to help kick things into gear when you need to get moving quickly. It's very tempting, and a lot of fun, to ramp up to 4 or more dice to get your boat flying along at higher speeds, but you have to balance that against how quickly you'll be able to drop all of that speed back down to handle the hair-pin turns that are always lurking ahead. 

I definitely don't recommend playing the full 3 races as a single game; play one race as one game and then, if you have time and feel like it, play as many more "games" as you want. Otherwise, I think the game would quickly outwear it's welcome - especially with larger numbers of players. Also, I prefer to play without the rule that limits your choices when deciding in which direction to turn your boat: If I have a better chance of winning by intentionally allowing my boat to take damage, then that's what I want to do; don't force me to go careening off-course to fall hopelessly behind....

My quest to find the best roll-and-move racing game has ended. Powerboats offers a phenomenal amount of control with the dice, great implementation of theme with the buoys and steering rules, literally allows you to find your own path to victory (or to the bottom of the sea), and offers so much replayability with the modular double-sided boards. It's also really easy to teach, and the flexibility with the races means you can abort the game after a 15-20 minute race if people aren't getting into it. If they like it, you can hash out a 3-race series in 1 hour! That's how a race should be: fast and frantic! Formula who?

Read my positive review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/405464]here[/url]. It elaborates on a defining characteristic of Powerboats: this is an original dice puzzle game, not a true board game.

Powerboats -- Played once; three-player.

Good enough, but not a stand-out.  The advanced boards might engage my interest more, as they look like they reduce the straight-aways and require more judicious manipulation of the dice.

Unlike other race games, the "track" is fluid.  No, I don't mean that it's water (though it "is" water).  I mean that instead of driving within lanes, players can vary their route, with the only restriction being that their boats must pass around buoys in the labeled direction -- by whatever route works with their speed and direction.  This gimmick works.

Very cool racing game.  

First I'm going to say that Knizia really corrupted the industry's ability to let a short game remain short.  He set in play the trend to play the same game three times in a row.  I feel the same mistake is being made here. Play it once, finish the game.  Play it again if you want.  But one of the reasons it works so well is because it is short and variable.  It will only outstay its welcome in any collection if it forces players to play this three times in a row.

Anyway, the momentum (dice management) is great.  You can make your game deterministic or you can push your luck to get ahead.  Very fun.

The only thing I don't like about the game is that the rules force you to take longer routes rather than taking damage to stay on course.  I much prefer to give people the choice.  That's what makes games like Formula De fun.  I say scrap this rule.

Very fun race game with a humorous side.  Good laughs when others (and yourself) crash the out of control boats.  Feels similar to Formula D since you decide to risk big rolls or play it safe.  I like how the board and setup are variable.  This game will make waves in most game groups.

a fun and unpredictable racing game, with very little rules overhead

this game is hilarious. this is either a great game, or i had a really good session of it. the game does a marvelous job of simulating how difficult it is for a novice to command one of these speedy vessels. there was lots of careening into land the first round

I understand that there are many games in the racing genre. There may be others quite like Powerboats. I have not played them. 

The idea is to race around a series of buoys on a board composed of adjoining hexagonal spaces. Throw in some dice and you have the game. It's a simple idea, even an obvious one. It's kind of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice race game (yet another from Essen '08!) with simple rules. Despite all the dice, there's obviously a lot of tactical decision making in the race. Also, it feels like you have much more control than in Formula Dé because your speed is more predictable -- each die only ranges from 1-3 and you can save them from turn to turn!

I think it may run a bit too long, though (but not like Formula Dé!)? Need to play it again.

--- Summary ---
The full game is a race over 3 courses, randomly set up (places for buoys are marked on the board ... you randomly place the start, finish, and marker bouys). Players start the game with no dice. On your turn you may pick up any of your dice from last turn, add a new d3 or discard one of these d3, then roll all these dice. You must move the full sum of all these dice if possible -- are allowed to make a 60 degree turn before moving. If you run into obstacles (board edge, buoy, island) you take damage and run aground -- must start with just 1d3 next turn. Get points based on finishing position each race; most points after 3 races wins the game.

RATING: 6
It seems very cool and inventive at first, and I love the 3-sided dice, but after a couple of plays it becomes boring. It seems like the best strategy is to go slow to have more control; like the tortoise and the hare, you'll likely come out ahead.

I have no desire to play it again. I'd rather play Snow Tails.

I like Powerboats.  Yay!  I wish the English rules translation were better -- better enough that it sounded like it had been written by someone who spoke English -- but the rules are fundamentally sound, simple, and sufficient unto the details thereof.  Zooming around in this little lake with the plain steps each turn of find your speed, choose your direction, and move your boat is really fun and challenging.  I suppose it's the finely tuned use of d3 that make it work so well.  I expect to play Powerboats again and again.  P.S. I do agree with the prevailing sentiment that a "game" is rightly regarded as a single race, and that running three with doubled and tripled rewards is mere foolishness; it's not as though it's feasible to target a particular player whose score you need to catch.

[1 play] Initial Reaction Rating.  Just didn't seem like a good well balanced game.  Normally I like race game too, I enjoy racing themes and game play.  This game just felt really hard to pass.  The lanes are so narrow to get around the islands and there were so many boats always in the way in the ideal spots once I was behind.  Maybe it just was a bad play, but I could be talked into trying this game again, but really am not planning to go out of my way for it.

RATING: 5
Nearly better than average racing game. The ability to "lock" in die rolls really gives you the opportunity to plan ahead. Careful attention must be paid to getting around the buoys. If you overshoot your mark you can kiss that race goodbye. By the time you've maneuvered yourself back in position, the other boats are miles ahead. I'd play it again, but I probably wouldn't request it, and I definitely don't need to own it. Still, a solid effort.

Played 3+ times.  It's a good game.  There's an opportunity for luck to play a part, but with careful planning you don't actually have to roll that much and you can be in complete control of your deceleration.  Very nice.  Probably won't get played a lot, but I'm happy to have it.  Faster and a little less fiddly than Mississippi Queen and seats six out of the box

So underwhelming.

I was expecting so much from this and it is a poor cross between Mississippi Queen and Asteroyds (I'd guess).

Possibly my least favourite race game so far.

Update: Okay, I might have been a bit harsh all those years ago. The risk management in this is actually quite clever, to the extent that I wonder whether we even played by the right rules last time. It's decent, three races felt a little too long, but there is some real promise here.

Rating up from 5.6 to 6.5.

Played once with 6 players, twice with 2 players and once with 3 players. Sweet spot is probably 4-5. Too much down time with 6 players. Very nicely produced boat racing game with a modular board and 3 sided dice for determining movement. There is an awful lot of luck in this game and just one bad roll can put you out of the running for that race since it is a very difficult game to catch up to a leader. Plays faster than Ave Caesar, but it might be a little long for three races still.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
On paper, Powerboats is a knockout. The endless die modifiers of race games like Formula D have been replaced  with a clean upshift/downshift mechanism built on adding/removing 3-sided dice. Genius! Yet the result is astonishingly bland. A small expansion adds more lake flavor to the blue grid, but the real issue is that this is a very pure roll-and-move.  I wonder if it would be more fun if all players rolled real-time, over and over again, until somebody crossed the finish line.

RATING: 8
Excellent race game.  The ability to save dice gives players much more control and much more interesting decisions.  The modular board and flexible buoys and start locations makes each running different.  Running three full races consecutively is usually overstaying its welcome, but sure helps balance things out if anyone is keeping score.  I think it would be better to just keep a running tally over several game days.

owerboats was one of the many racing games that overstayed its welcome. I just got through espousing the wonderful design of StreetSoccer by Corné van Moorsel in my last column Varsity Geek (see http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/tom_rosen_varsity_geek/), but this time Corné isn’t taking home the gold. Powerboats is a motor boat racing game that was on my list to try because of the intriguing three-side dice but just like Niagara, the gimmick wore thin after the initial excitement of the innovation. Powerboats is a three-lap race around buoys that you set up differently for each lap, scoring points based on your position at the end of each lap (with each successive round worth more points a la Family Feud or the BGG.CON Game Show), and tallying the score at the end. The gimmick is that you use three-sided dice to determine your speed. It’s reminiscent of Formula Dé because you can shift up a gear, downshift, or stay the same each turn by either adding or removing a die from your speed or staying put, and then rolling any new dice and re-rolling any existing dice that you choose to re-roll. The most interesting aspect of the game is actually the fact that you must move the full distance if at all possible, which may result in you shooting off in the completely wrong direction and having to backtrack a long way to get around the next buoy. In the end, Powerboats fails to stand out in a crowded field of racing games, a genre that I’m not predisposed to in the first place, but if you can’t get enough of racing games then you may want to check this one out to see if it’s your cup of tea.

I have to begrudgingly give Powerboats an 8.  I rejected it at first without playing, but once I did it won me over.

Of all race games, I so wanted to love Snow Tails. Except there's one problem. The #1 ingredient in a race game for me needs to be speed of play/turns.  I'm sure there are experienced Snow Tails players who are very fast. That doesn't work when you're playing with people who might see an individual game maybe 3 times a year. The game has to go fast.

On this Powerboats delivers.  Fewer rules than Formula D as well.  As far as I'm concerned, even though I suck at it, Powerboats is the go-to game for a light racing game for a group of six.

Note: I've yet to try Ave Caesar which I understand also has fast turns. Unfortunately, the most desirable edition of this is OOP.

I've played a forum game here on BGG, but this was my first time playing the actual game. Something just seemed to be missing to me. The turns were pedestrian, I'll add a dice, move 4, your turn.

As in the forum game, I just don't see how to play this game well. If I play safe, I finish near the end of the pack. If I take any risk at all, no matter how small the dice hose me and send me off into a far corner, and I finish last.

I love the way you set speeds and move the boats.  It actually feels like boat racing to me (given my exceptionally limited knowledge of the subject).

However, the scoring is flawed.  The ever-escalating scores for winning later races means whoever wins the third race wins, unless a different person won both the first and second race, and then it's only a tie.

I actually liked this one a lot more than I thought I would after I read the rules.  While it is a dice fest, there is quite a bit more strategy than in, say Formula De, as the variability of the dice is a lot less since they are (1) d3s, and (2) retained from turn to turn.

Similar to Mississippi Queen or old war games that play on a hex map. The 3 sided dice represent how fast you can go. You can add or subtract one at the start of you turn. Your problems are always slowing down before you crash or the turning radius if you are going to fast. Worth checking out.

This game is exactly what I want it to be.  A race game of strategic movement with just a touch of press your luck thrown in.  It looks great on the table and the turns move fast enough that you really feel like you are racing.  It even scales very nicely. More players runs slower, but feels more racey as the ships bunch up together at the turns.

Are people really serious?  Powerboats is anything but quick, and depending on how the buoys are set up, you could find yourself circling the board several times to complete the track.  All the movement and accelerating/decelerating mechanics are similar variant of the ones seen before in Mississippi Queen and Formula De.  There is nothing new or inventive here.  I could be convinced to compete in one race, but never again will I participate in the full game.

A light, simplistic, dice management racing game, that plays with little to no downtime & involves less luck than you may initially think.

Unfortunately it's not terribly exciting.

The races are usually very tight. Even large errors can be corrected to make for some astonishing comebacks.

Using leading boats as 'air brakes' instead of dropping dice can be very rewarding when rounding buoys. As is intentionally slowing down to scupper other boats positioning.

[i]The Buoys let the product down. They would have been better if they were made of plastic, or even just red wooden disks with numbers on the top/bottom & direction arrows around the side. As they are, the loose fitting cardboard buoys constantly fall apart, & really need to be glued together.[/i]

I ended up making [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/11080/powerboats-boy-oh-buoy]my own buoys[/url] which I like a lot better.

Also the occasional 'newb' 6 player race can leave you short on spare dice to roll, so you'll need to keep track with either pen & paper or an additional 'three?' proxy dice in some games.

A great game to play with small children; there are some decisions that still exist in terms of income probability and abilities to steal income, but its a roll then pray sort of game after that.... Best with 3 players, otherwise it really seems to overstay its welcome on the table.

RATING: 6
Really cute game! Scratches the same itch as Catan IMO. There are a few things that are naturally flawed with this game. 
1) Strategies really don't change between people or games. More variety of buildings = more wealth and then concentrate on just one type. 
2) A lot is left to chance
3) Frankly a little boring. 

Would play with first time gamers.

Find it really hard to care at all while playing this. Too simple and too repetitive, and although the Harbour expansion takes care of that problem to a degree, the game just seems to lose direction instead, at least to a player that finds it so boring...

Enjoyed the basic concept of the game.  Simple engine building with dice.

Didn't enjoy the take that aspects of the game (Red cards).  Just seemed to make things difficult, also the red cards would be more powerful then the green ones in multi-player games.

I was hoping for more of a gateway game in this, but it is not present in the game + expansion.  It may be there in the base game though, so I'll need to give it a try.

Fun little game, but with minimal replay value. (I've played maybe 6-7 times and am pretty done with it). It mainly suffers from the fact that the most effective ways to play are pretty boring (just buy all of the same thing). This is alleviated somewhat by house-ruling the marketplace, but that still doesn't really solve the issue.

Still gets a 6 rating because it's a really nice little gateway/non-gamer/family game. Easy to pitch as "all the fun bits of monopoly without any of the boring bits". Everyone gets it straight away, and actually, for inexperienced gamers who don't immediately see the broken-ness of it, I think it's an interesting puzzle.

RATING: 6
5 plays / 3,4,5 players. (some w/Harbor expansion)

LIKE: Quick and light! The expansion rules to setting up the rows are a must-use in my opinion. It's fun to hit big on a good roll, which reminds me of craps at the casino.

DISLIKE: Bad rolls can slow the game down. The game can be a little boring if people play too nice.

OVERALL: Get the attack-y cards to make it interesting, or pile up on one card to push your luck. Otherwise the game can be dull and frustrating. It should play quickly. The game is very swingy, but oddly entertaining. I like it if played casually.

This is a fine filler/gateway game. It plays so easy and is so easy to explain - and in my opinion makes no pretense to be anything else. There's preciously little strategy in it and it does punish players who are behind (this one encourages taking money from opponents - so the rich do get richer). The variants of dealing out 10 unique cards makes the game set up and play with more interest. Over all, I like it.

RATING: 6
Has a lot of potential. However, I am not entirely convinced. There seems to be quite little incentive to move to the higher cards and I suspect there is a couple of dominant strategies. Furthermore, the game apparently has a tendency for abrupt endings. Nevertheless, quite entertaining and creates a feeling of making progress. This is achieved with the rather short playing time.

RATING: 5
*Rating based on one play of a PnP copy.

I had heard a lot of buzz surrounding this game, so I was interested in giving it a try.  It was quickly clear to me that this is not a game for me.  There's just too much randomness, too much screwage, and not enough decisions in the game.

+Fun artwork and theme

-Lots of stealing from other players.  Normally I would put this as neither a positive nor a negative since some players like this kind of thing, but in this game I think it's just a negative.  With all the cards that take money from your opponents, you pretty much have to spend all your money as soon as you can, or else risk losing it, which I think detracts from the decision making in the game.
-Highly luck based.
-Has a snowballing, rich-get-richer issue.
-Takes a lot of table space.

A sim city builder that involves drafting cards that represent different parts of your city that produce a certain amount of currency or special power based on a certain die roll. More tactical than strategic this game is fast and light but with just enough decision making to keep even "eurosnoots" interested, min maxers min maxing, and AP players overwhelmed. Always worth the real estate in your bag of games on game night.

Nice little filler game. The fact that most people get money every round after a while keeps things going and fun. Unfortunately, there really seems to only be one strategy, as I keep doing it and I have yet to lose a game. Although I have come close to not winning a couple of times.

Needs more cards for variety though. Maybe expansion will fix that. I have also read about the 10-card variant. I should try that one.

Played it 3-4 times.  Extremely luck based.  In half the games we found combo's that basically broke the game.  If someone can break a game with a certain dice roll there isn't much skill.  I don't mind dice or some luck, but it's 75% luck, 25% skill imo.  Replayability is extremely low as well.

Pretty fun and light dice game to play. You use the dice or die to see what card(s) pay out on each players turn. Shine cards pay on your turn only, some on anyone's turn and others only if other players roll it. The base game is good but some buildings are over powered in my opinion but I can't wait for the expansion which is supposed to solve this issue. I feel like this is a great game to play with people that don't play games much or are new to the hobby. Easy for all ages with minimal help for younger players. A must try unless your group is heavy gamers only, then you might want to pass on it before you try it.

Quite a fun little engine-building game.  The similarities to [b]Settlers[/b] end at 2d6 distribution.  It is random, sure, but you can "bet" so many ways on the die rolls: 1 die, 2 dice, bet on yourself, bet on others, multiply buildings or diversify.  It's a simple, yet clever design that deserves its popularity, not unlike [b]Splendor[/b].

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Machi Koro is one of those games that got quite a deal of buzz when it came out. However it never really caught my eye, probably because I'm not a big fan of its artwork for some reason. When I finally got to try it though, I definitively understood why this game is so popular.

Machi Koro is in fact one of the best light/family games I've ever played. It's super simple to explain, it plays smoothly but it still offers a good amount of decisions, strategies and tactics. The game is also very engaging, because what other people roll on their turn might affect you as well. This is all so very clever! Yet my favorite thing about it is the fact that you can unlock special powers, as you build the big buildings. This adds a level of depth to the game-play, in which you need to decide what special ability you need to unlock first.

Machi Koro is a great title for those situations where you need a filler game... and it also comes in a quite portable box. DO NOT however play it with the expansions, because they ruin everything that is so fun about it. They just make the game more convoluted and stupidly random. The game is a very well put-together product as it is and it's one that I will enjoy playing every now and then.

Rating with the expansions: 3.5

A light filler game indeed. 

Rolling the dice and building up your city at its simplest form. Strategy is light enough for a younger group of gamers or beginners to games. 

There are limitations to the basic box. As the number of different cards do not give much options. Extra cards from expansions will make this game better. 

Strategy is random and dependent on yours and others luck in dice roll. There is really no strategy to prepare. It's all in the die rolls. 

Quick, light, kid friendly game. Pretty good.

Went to my FLGS to buy Tash Kalar, but somehow left with this.

Gorgeous theme and fun concept, but seriously lacks variety. 2P suffers from a dominant strategy (single dice, convenience store), and 4P games all seem very similar too, usually coming down to a Cheese Factory rush. The expansions may fix things, but don't want to throw good money after bad, considering I paid £25 for an enormous, mostly empty box. The game really should have been £15 in a slipcase.

Traded away. Wish I'd bought Tash Kalar.

в целом с драфтом немного повеселее (драфт вынуждает придумать, как наиболее эффективно распорядиться картами в наличии; плюс не дать полезную карту другому), разве что с толстенной колодой нужно что-то придумывать.

First, the negatives: a dumbed-down version of Settlers of Catan. Strategic thought is necessary, yes; but the strategies are pretty obvious (and by-the-by, playing with either one die or two can be game-winning: it all depends on the cards you've got). It's an engine-building game; but it is so stinkin' short that game-end leaves one feeling like, "Wow...I was just getting started, and now it's over." There is a definitely a runaway leader problem.

But in spite of all that, it's fun! Machi Koro is the perfect game to play with non-gamers. And, in spite of my complaint about its brevity, being such a short game is a plus, because you can then play something better!

Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on his own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than his rivals. On his turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, he gets the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of his city on future turns. The first player to construct all of his landmarks wins!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In some ways Machi Koro felt like a tableau building version of Settlers of Catan. But it's so much quirkier and has different, neat ways the dice work. I like it for that reason. But the base game is virtually the same every time you play it, unfortunately. If you add the expansion, I would call it a good game. But the base game on its own is just okay.

The game that I would say it most closely competes with would be Catan. If you're trying to decide between those games, definitely choose this one.

But for me, it's pretty unexceptional. It's a variant on Dominion (sort-of), but with sufficient dice action to make it winnable by almost anyone. I generally like games with a race-to-the-target ending, and I appreciate how easy this game should be to teach (though the guy who taught it to us was impressively tongue-tied in his attempt to do so). I can see why it's popular. I'd play it again. But I'd rather play Carcassonne, Metropolys, or Junk Art if I wanted something fun to play with people who don't play games and want something they can learn in 2 minutes.

As everyone says, Machi Koro is reminiscent of both Settlers (roll a dice and collect resources - well just one, coins) and Dominion (buy new cards).  The aim is to be the first to build four costly advanced buildings.  There is a big dollop of dicey luck, but this is a quick filler so we'll not worry too much about that. A more serious criticism is that there just aren't many card types and therefore few strategic options.  Yeah, but this is a quick filler and quite fun.

A nice light game, easy to learn but over a little quickly. I found the base game on its own too predictable and liable to favour whoever knows the optimal winning strategies. Adding the harbour expansion means you are playing from a random subset of the available cards, so players have to plan using the cards available and may not be able to use any of the standard winning strategies.

Απλό καρτοπαίχνιδο με ζάρια που κινείτε πάνω στον βασικό μηχανισμό των Αποίκων. Κάθε γύρα ρίχνεις ένα ζάρι και ανάλογα με το αποτέλεσμα ενεργοποιούνται κάποιες κάρτες και παράγουν λεφτά με τα οποία μπορείς να αγοράσεις καινούργιες κάρτες ώστε μελλοντικά να έχεις μεγαλύτερο εισόδημα. Νικητής είναι όποιος καταφέρει πρώτος να χτίσει και τις 4 monument κάρτες του.

Ουσιαστικά είναι ένα engine building παιχνίδι αλλά η υπερβολική χρήση του ζαριού το κάνει πολύ luck dependant. Οι κανόνες είναι εξαιρετικά απλοί και ο ρυθμός είναι γρήγορος. Μια παρτίδα 4άρων παικτών μας πήρε 45 λεπτά. 

Υπάρχουν διάφορα κτήρια/κάρτες που μπορείς να αγοράσεις. Άλλες λειτουργούν μόνο στη γύρα σου, άλλες μόνο στις γύρες των αντιπάλων και άλλες πάντα, όμως γενικά πιο σημαντικό είναι να έχεις το ζάρι με το μέρος σου. 

Απλό, γρήγορο, εύκολο και με χαριτωμένα γραφικά. Κατάλληλο για casual παίκτες αλλά δεν βλέπω πως μπορεί να  ικανοποιήσει τους hardcorάδες.

Dice rolling, city building

Welcome to the city of Machi Koro, the Japanese card game that is sweeping the world. You've just been elected Mayor.  Congrats! Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower.  A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die. Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region.  You will need to collect income from developments, build public works and steal from your neighbor's coffers.

It's great. I waited bloody ages to play this as it was nearly impossible to find and I was surprised that when I actually sat down to play it lived up to expectations. It's by no means a mind-blowing game, but it looks wonderful, stays fun and gives you plenty to think about. I wonder if it'll feel samey once you've figured out an optimal build. I'm sure expansions will fix that as the system itself is good fun.

RATING: 7
A worthy gateway game that might be considered in the family of Settlers of Cataan in that it allows players to roll the dice on their turn, and have their roll affect every other player's fortunes, which of course, is a desirable design feature to keep everyone interested in every roll.  This attribute explains, in part, the success of Settlers.

The design also cleverly includes a progression from rolling one die to two, and card capabilities/rewards split between those that apply when the player rolls, and those that apply when other players roll.

Is this a gamers' game that I am going to want to play often?  No, not really.  Nevertheless, this game might serve nicely as a gateway game, and please a lot of non-gamers.  I certainly prefer this dice roller to Yahtzee, and I might even prefer it to Settlers at this point in my game playing history.

Light and fun, but I wish there were a few more decisions to make. Too many turns spending rolling dice, hoping for a good roll, then doing nothing. Or alternately, getting a good roll and only being able to buy one thing anyway. 

Plus, snowball effect is a very real thing. It can be hard to get out from behind the pack if you miss the better early game cards.

A fun little dice rolling/engine building game that plays fairly quickly. Expansion makes the game more interesting as it changes the market from being static to being completely random. The cards are incredibly flimsy and should have been made of a much more durable material considering how often they're used. Game really suffers from a rich get richer problem while poor players just sit back and watch the runaway leader eventually win. The game becomes really boring and unenjoyable when it reaches that point.

FINALLY! We had seen this game played by so many reviewers online but it took so long to get we though it might just be a huge internet/gaming hoax. But it's real!
And a very good game to boot. It incorporates many mechanic and styles of play into a small box. It feels like a civilization building game,. plays like a deck builder and works like set collection. A lot of game in a small package. The art is whimsical and the game play is easy to follow. It took a while to get it, but it ain't going nowhere.

RATING: 6
A light engine-building filler with good player interaction and fun artwork that plays pretty fast.

I find that the engines are a bit too obvious. In Dominion, a different set of cards will come out in every game, making each game different. In this game, all the cards are used, so in theory, you can use the same strategy every time. This also hurts the game's replayability. Some strategies seem stronger than others, and I don't really see a reason to buy cards that only give you money on your turn when you can buy cards that can give you money on anyone's turn.

Instead of being "Roll and Move", this game is "Roll and Generate Money", so there's an enormous luck factor at work here...

... then you buy buildings with the money you (hopefully) rolled, and create your economic engine...

... and finally, you do this over and over and over again, ad nauseum.  That's it, that's the entire game!

This game isn't just dry, it's arid.

A fun game, sort of lives up to the hype though there seem to be easy winning strategies (personally I think the second die rolls and higher building numbers are too much of a risk, and have won sticking with a 1-6 range and getting those 6 buildings that grab money away from my opponents). Like the artwork, and am excited to grab the Harbor expansion which hopefully fixes up some of that easy strategy while bringing more depth and options.

There is a strategy that initially seems counter-intuitive but has been successful in every game I've played.  Never roll 2 dice, only use one.  This mitigates the element of chance and forces every turn to be profitable.  Playing this way may make the game feel broken however.

Like settlers (produce on dice throws).  Like Dominion (buy cards).  Nice graphics,  good length, simple.  Much going for it,  but it's still a dice game, so essentially luck-driven.  If it were £5 I'd buy it for the occasional outing, but at £25+, no way.

An engaging little dice and card game, where your dice roll generates income from your or your opponents cards.  Income is used to acquire more cards.  Each card has a trigger number similar to Settlers.  The winner is the first to complete (buy) their four objective cards, one of which allows you to upgrade from one dice to two, with the knock on changes to the probabilities of rolling numbers in the 1 (none) to 12 (1 in 36) range.  I played the 7 strategy which failed first game and won the second.  A nice filler - if only I could get hold of a copy from somewhere!

RATING: 7
A light and charming game that borrows from Settlers of Catan and Dominion.  It's actually seems a little simpler than both.  While the gameplay is refreshing it doesn't come off as clever as I think it would like to be.

Worth owning as a solid, fast playing game that will delight casual gamers.

In dire need of an expansion to keep the game interesting over multiple plays.

Jópofa kis konfrontatív játék, amiben Dominion szerűen ki vannak pakolva a kártyatípusok, amikből vehetünk, de itt nyílt paklit építünk, és nagyon jól behatárolhatóan 4 féle laptípus van: az egyik pénzt ad a saját kockadobások után, a másik az ellenfelek dobásai után is, a harmadik az ellenfél bizonyos dobásainál rabol az elenféltől, a negyedik típussal meg saját dobásainknál lehet szemétkedni.
Dinamikus, pörgős, élvezetes. Keményen szerencsefüggő. Kis túlzással partijátékba hajlik szerintem, néha annyira röhejes fordulatok vannak benne:)) Furcsa kicsit, de a kockadobásokról a Catan jutott eszembe, mert itt is van olyan, hogy mondjuk egy 3-as dobásra mindenkinek a 3-as kártyái/területei termelnek 1 pénzt. De itt változatosabban van megoldva a dolog, pont a 4 típus miatt. Egyébként ha jól emlékszem, 12-es dobás nem volt az egész parti során.
Néha már annyi fajta kártya van előttünk (az alapjátékban 15 fajta lap van, plusz mindenkinek kezdettől 4 olyan, amit fel kell fordítani a győzelemhez), hogy volt hogy elfelejtettem behajtani a jussomat, pl. ellenfél 9-es dobásánál több féle lap is jövedelmezett volna, de én a kékekről mindig elfeledkeztem (kb. 30-40 pénzzel rövidítettem meg így magam:)), de az a kategória, ahol ez nem zavarja az embert:)

I took a punt on this thinking that it would be a good game to play with the fiance who isn't into games in the same way I am.

When I explained the rules she likened the game to Dominion but after the first game said it lacked depth which I have to agree with.

We'd rather play Dominion which is only slightly more complicated and has a similar play length.

Expansions might change this view if I pick them up.

RATING: 6.5
Machi Koro is the epitome of the filler: plays in 30 minutes, light but with some choices (when to switch to two die; spreading numbers vs bet on some for big turns), apparently random but with lots of odds management...

Production quality is definitely pleasant: great tin box, huge clunky dice, thick cardboard money. The only sub par component are the cards: they are flimsy, but are not to be shuffled, so who cares?

The game plays at its full potential with 4 players, it is still fun and ok with 3, but definitely lacks some excitement with only 2.
Rating is probably 7 with more players, but it loses at least a half point for playing poorly with 2...

I am eager to play it with my gamer friends as the closing filler, as well as with non gamers and my daughters.

Initial Impression: This is a dice and card based racing game in which you build a tableau in order to take advantage of dice rolls which trigger resource gains. The card art is simple but functional, which mirrors the overall gameplay. My feeling is that the key to doing well in this game is timing when to use 2 dice as opposed to 1, and when to commit resources to obtain the goal structure cards rather than resource engine cards.

RATING: 7
An interesting, quick game that is a good combination of luck as well as strategy (Which card(s) do you want to buy?  When should you roll one or two dice?).  However, we've found, when playing with two players, the incentive to roll two dice is minimal, thus reducing the game to who is going to roll a 4 (the "convenience store" number) first.  The game is also not typically interesting after this point, as the lucky player is virtually unbeatable.

Game is more interesting with 3 or 4 players, as the incentive to roll two dice and diversify what cards you own is much greater.

Fun little dice filler with some fun decisions to make. The different buildings allow for interesting combos and varied strategies, and the die roll leaves everyone holding their breath and hoping their buildings generate income. Nothing deep or super impressive, but breezy and fun.

My kids (ages 8 and 9) LOOOOVE this game and would rate it a ten right next to Bohnanza and Galaxy Trucker.  I think it's a bit too predictable and provides only a few ways to win.  It's still lots of fun, though, especially with four players.

RATING: 7
Easy to explain, understand...  but something about this sort of ran a little long in 4 player.  For all the dice rolling and getting money, something was a little bland.

Solid gripe - pretty blatant on the "we're going to sell expansions" front.  Giant box, hardly any cards, and you can totally see the room for variation on games if you've ever played Dominion.  If you sold Dominion with 1/3rd the cards, that's about the same effect buying this empty box has.   NOW, On the other hand, I do agree with limiting the initial experience to a very specific and small subset.

I really like this game but I hear you either like it or hate it. dice rolling is the key to getting tokens in order to buy cards to help you ultimately win. you can steal other players cards and vice versa. while game play remains the same it's up to the dice to win the game.

Takes the mechanics of Catan (Roll a die and take resources) and takes away the negotation, but adding some element of "deck"-building / card drafting.

Works quite well, is short and engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lightweight, high-variance game with enough depth to be interesting and that plays fast enough to avoid wearing out its welcome.  Not my favorite, but it's a fun little devil just the same and looks like it would make a pretty decent gateway game.

RATING: 6
A simple yet fun game. You can create sprawling economies and... that's pretty much it. It can be a lot of fun to introduce non-gamers to Machi Koro though, if it had more elements to it then I would rate it higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Machi Koro is a tableau-building, dice-rolling, engine-creating card game, wherein you build up a little town of building cards, and each building does something on a certain die roll. You can try to cover all possible dice roll outcomes, or you can focus on just a few numbers that will offer big payouts, but after all's said and done, the luck of the dice is going to be the deciding factor. I've played it twice and I feel like I've seen absolutely all there is to see here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Machi Koro has a fun theme and is a great game to introduce to non-gamers. As a strategy game, it is too dependent on dice rolls and the game gets repetitive after several plays. I am not a fan, but this will stay in my collection as a gateway game

I like the simplicity of this game, combined with the variety of strategies you can attempt. It was funny because no matter how strategic I thought I was being, plans always seemed to backfire when it came to the roll of the dice. Yet all of us were close to victory at the same time. I'll be interested to play this game some more in order to explore what strategies are most effective. It can get a little nasty particularly when you start stealing stuff from your opponents, but since it's luck of the dice most people probably won't take it personal. Now that we've played once I hope that the game will go quicker and we'll be able to enjoy it in a more reasonable amount of time. This is a keeper.

A dice chucking luck infested simple game that is fun with the right group and serves as a filler or a quick playing game with non gamers. Although usually not my type of game, I had fun trying to roll for the big payoff to win the game. The game states 30 minutes for the playtime, but our second game came in at about half of that quote.

I haven't played with any of the expansions; so I cannot comment on them.

Apparently this is "hot right now". Not for me it isn't. The cartoony graphics are nice and it could be a sweet, little engine-building filler were it not for its reliance on dice. The first few rounds of a short engine-builder can be hugely important, so why make them luck dependent? A few crap rolls at the start of the game and you can spend the next 20 minutes watching everyone accelerate away from you..

Despite looking like a simplified The City with dice, Machi Koro lasts too long for the filler it is: were it shorter - half its current playtime or even less - it might be fun.

RATING: 9
Initial Impressions:

Really fun mix of Dominion / Catan.  The base game is good by itself, but will feel "samey" quickly.  The expansion is a must for this game, and the best way to play is where 10 types are available per turn from a deck of building cards.

Update 1:
Dropped to an 8 (from a 9), because I feel like the only way to really play the game is with 3 people.  4 player, the red cards are too powerful, and in 2 player they are too weak.

Update 2:
I think the Machi Koro expansion fixes the issues I had with the previous expansion.  I only will play with the variant of randomly having 10 buildings available at any time, however with the Machi Koro exp, this variant was even more fun!  This is one of my favorite games, and even though it has a ton of luck, I have so much fun playing every time we bust it out.

horrible rich-get-richer mechanic (king maker)

Lots of attacking (there is no winning strategy that doesn't include attacking), can go from rich to broke in one round, several times.  Based on dice rolls, you can basically not play a game while others have no problems. 

Bad game in a pretty wrapping.

This is one of our favorite family games. We play with both of the above expansions, and I would recommend playing with at least 1 expansion, as they add more variety and force you to adjust strategy to the available cards. With just the base game, once you figure out the strategy, you just use the same one each time, which makes it boring.

2012.  A light (30 min), dice-rolling, set collection, and economic card game that feels a bit like a deck-builder without the deck since all of your purchased cards stay face-up and active.  Ultimately, the game is too simple and luck-heavy to keep my interest, even as a filler game and even with the expansion/advanced types of buildings mixed in.  It's an interesting concept/mechanic, but having almost every turn hinge on a die roll is not incredibly fun or satisfying.

Others say: Settlers of Catan "Light" with special powers... okay but probably don't need to own.

This is an ultra-light roll-and-buy game. Roll dice, get or pay money, maybe buy a card. Really, there's not much strategy to be had at all, simple maths tells you which cards are the best.
Plus, the game drags and drags and drags, because many rounds, you'll roll, your number doesn't come up, you get to do nothing. It's really not the 30 minutes on the box, more like 60, and each and every one of them is boring and tedious.
The only upside I see to this game is that it's realistically age 6 and up, so if you want a gateway game for kids, this might be it.

Mix the dice from Catan with Dominion-like card choosing and what you get is a bland luck fest with a runaway leader. 

Okay, on a positive note; It's much shorter than a game of Catan and you don't need to shuffle constantly like in Dominion.

It looks cute and maybe is more catered towards the less die hard gamer, but if that's what you look for, there are so many better games to choose from. Try Sushi-go Party, Stone Age, Kingdomino, or King of Tokyo as some random relatively light suggestions.

Fun game as it is, but gets even better when you add the Harbor expansion!

Overall I can see why this game is popular. That being said, I did not enjoy my first play.

The sheer amount of cards available for purchase right from the start was overwhelming. It caused a lot of AP around the table. The other complaint I have with having all the cards available from turn 1 is that there's probably 1 strategy that's better than all the rest that is just waiting to be discovered. It feels way too static.

I will gladly play it again if someone wants to (because I haven't figured out the puzzle yet) but now I have no desire to buy it or suggest it.

It's been a while since I've played a game that made me this angry, and in returning to this rating I've actually dropped it lower; now the challenge is to try to avoid ranting and raving uselessly and stay constructive. 

The luck in this game is infuriating. Part of that might be that the Take That style cards should just be out of the game... but even without them, this game's resource system is like Catan. That's the only description I can use, and most people would agree that the resource system is the most outdated and infuriating part of Catan. But in this game... it's nearly the whole game. I hate how much power the luck has here. And yes, I acknowledge, that if I make a bad city, it's my fault, and I may lose from that. But the game also kicks you when your down, and rewards one random player amongst the three that have built a good city. When I lose it feels like you've failed to crawl out of a tar pit, and worse than that, when you win, it feels like you mised the win on a lucky roll anyways. I feel bad when I'm losing, I feel bad when I win (oops! Sorry, I guess I have enough money to win now), I feel bad watching other people losing, this game is just WAY too full of feel bads. Not denying that there are fun parts to this game, but there are way better tableau builders than this. I will attempt to never play this again.

I don't understand the hype for this game right now. 

The game has essentially two viable strategies to play or you can just buy a bit of everything and lose to a focused strategy.

This game might be better with the expansions but as is there is so little to this game other then choose your strategy and hope for luck with the dice. 

At least the art is rather cute...

I ended up trading this. It's just kind of a pain to set up for such a fluffy filler game, and I don't feel like having to buy expansions for the game to be worthwhile.

At two players, it really wasn't fun. For example, the "Convenience Store" card (priced for 2 coins), is extremely broken. If you roll a 4, then you get three coins. Buy 3 of these, and a single 4 can get you over 1/3 of the way to the most expensive utility. 

Perhaps if I played with more people, or lowered the availability of certain cards, it would be better. But I still don't like the heavy reliance on luck-of-the-dice. I think it could be fun with younger kids.

Suddenly one day it was standing in a drug store for 10€.
And then... I can't remember how... Somehow the game ended up at home.

A nice little filler but nothing special. Time will tell.

Played a couple of games and had a good start but couldn’t capitalise on it. Experienced players have the advantage. Has some “take-that” mechanisms and a lot of maths. Maths doesn’t bother me but I can see this as a game you have to be in the mood for.

I've got pretty mixed feelings about this game... On the one hand its a pretty solid design and I can see it getting really good down the road. On the other hand it was very heavily hyped and doesn't really meet my expectations... Overall I have to say that as an idea I like this game, it's fun to play, easy to teach and it looks great both in the box and on the table. Where it falls short though is replayability... I would have been very happy to pay double the price for this game if they would have doubled the amount of cards avalible. As it stands now the game gets very flat and one dimensonal after a few plays.

It was pretty enjoyable but I can see it getting old fast. I really want to try it with the expansion, I hear that it adds quite a bit of replay value to the game. As it stands it is definitely a game I will be excited to play here and there but I don't think I would want it hitting the table on a weekly basis.

RATING: 2.5
Full disclosure: I've only played this two-player, and as a 2-p. game, it is awful. The constant tug-of-war with two makes the game annoyingly long, and it is much harder to get an "engine" going when one player is consistently stealing from you and only you. 

The biggest problem is that the game simply plays itself. Sure, you can choose diverse numbers that will be activated differently, and you can try to get cards that will combo well together, but ultimately, the main mechanic is just "take money" or "lose money" for a much longer time than I'm willing to tolerate.

EDIT: Finally got to play this with three. Truly terrible game.

Nice little family game.  In the end, it really comes down to the roll of the dice.  However, the game makes you feel as if you have your destiny in your own hands.  Fortunately, it is short enough that the luck doesn't deter the gamers. Unfortunately, the expansions made the game longer. It's a little more interesting with the expansions, due to the variance of buildings. It's still a luck based family games. The AH-HA moments bring this one up a notch.

RATING: 5
A pretty light engine building game of building up a tableau of cards that trigger on die rolls.  Most cards earn you money when triggered, which you can use to buy more cards.  Your final goal is to build a set of 4 cards (each player is given an identical set of these 4 cards at the beginning of the game, on their unbuilt side).

I typically enjoy engine building games, but for some reason this one just felt kind of ho-hum to me.  However, it works really well as a filler that has a little but of meat to it since you can pick a strategy and roll with it.

I thought this game was very good, while at the same time being easy to teach to newer gamers.  The mechanics are simple but strategies can still be made.  If I had one gripe with the game it would be that if you are the last player certain cards may have been already bought up by all of the other players putting you at a disadvantage that you cannot control.  However this is fixed in the expansions by only having 10 unique cards and the rest will trickle in at any point in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Don't get the buzz on this one; I suppose if any game is light, cute, and basic strategy easily grasped it's a hit?  The strategies are limited to spreading out your numbers so that you hit on most turns and mixing in a tiny bit of deviation.  Choices are extremely limited and you can't focus at all.  This results in likely heading for the same bland soup-line strategy every game.

In some strange alternate reality where Settlers of Catan was never designed Machi Koro would deserve a modicum of recognition.  I don't live in that world.

The base game is alright, provided you've got more than two people. It has the same roulette-type excitement of Cataan, but isn't prone to dragging out too long the way that game can. 

Unfortunately, there is a bit of a runaway leader problem. Once a person gets ahead (which may have happened through shear luck), it's really tough to catch them.

RATING: 6
Quite light. Quite. I enjoy it, but I'm not sure if it's because the game is all that good as a goofy little engine builder, or if it's just that I enjoy calling out "Everybody wins!" on certain die rolls.

However, the Harbour expansion makes the game much worse for me. I won't play with it ever again.

Why?

Well, it adds many many red and purple cards which don't add money to the game, they simply pass it along from one player to the next. Not adding money on die rolls slows the game down (as does adding a fifth player and more mandatory buildings needed to win). The game is a fun thirty minute game. It is a very very long game when it takes over an hour (or worse, over two hours).

The random release of buildings makes this now more of a tactical game instead of a strategic game. It also, adds luck to the game, in that some players will never get a chance to buy the good cards.

It also can result in a very slow game if the purchasable cards are all late game cards (7 or higher) and you are in the early game (it happened to me...), or half of a combo cards (you know the ones, the cards that aren't good on their own).

My long winded way of saying, that the game increases the luck, and adds frustration, while at least doubling, more likely trippling, and occasionally quadrupling, the play time.

2-4, but expansion adds to 5

Fun, possible to have comebacks even though I se no mechanism for that. 

Can be slow, especially with AP. 

Update: after several plays of this with Harbor expansion, my friend has settled on a strategy that we can't seem to beat. The best chance we have is to copy his same strategy. So then we have all 4 players copying one strategy, which isn't fun. Downgraded for now. Will try with other friends to see if the same strategy dominates.

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

I am not really as enamored with this one as I thought I would be. It's cute enough, but the combo-building the game relies on just wasn't really doing it for me. I feel like I'd rather just play Dominion, etc.?

And even though I benefited from them hugely, I'm not really a fan of the "take that!" nature of the aggressive cards. There's no real defense, so I don't want to feel like I HAVE to take them in order to do well. Eh.

And not to point out the obvious, but the fact that the market is the same every game feels like it would give this game super crappy replay value. I can see why they added the expansion.

Also I don't know what we were doing wrong but our game [i]really[/i] dragged. Something like 45 minutes in someone asked "HOW long is this game supposed to take???" and I just sighed.

I like Machi Koro as a nice 20-30 minute filler. It is fun and easy to pick up on. I could see non-gamers enjoying this, much more so than something like 7 Wonders anyway.

For gamers, I do think it is a game that will require expansions, since playing with the same cards every time seems like it could get stale and obvious. As is, it certainly feels trivial to play relatively well, and then it is just who rolls well early enough to ramp up the quickest.

RATING: 2
i don't know what it is with me and Japanese games. They're charming in their way; Machi Koro especially so, with its cartoonish card art and general breezy approach. But this one's just too lightweight for my tastes. MK technically rewards strategy in the sense that the player who approaches the game with some sort of plan will outdo the player who moves totally at random, but beyond it being worthwhile to have that some sort of plan in place it seems to me that the dice determine winners and losers.

Dominion is a similar game in some senses, but what makes Dominion a far superior game to MK, in my opinion, is three things: one is that Dominion's kingdom cards vary from game to game and thus no two games play out the same. The second is that Dominion's varied kingdom cards have real (but non-obvious) synergies between them that work out in ways that surprise and delight the player. The third: one essential aspect of the Dominion experience is that success in VP gathering ends up being a drag on the means of future success, since most green cards are useless in game. Machi Koro is strictly win-to-win/snowball effect.

Part of the problem may be that I experienced MK in a period when I was obsessing over Mottainai (similar playtime) and Suburbia (superficially similar theme), both of which are far superior gamer's games than Machi Koro is or (to be fair) even tries to be. 

But mostly it's just not what I'm looking for in a game. I was not expecting something super-deep but I know that it's possible for a game to be both mechanically simple and strategically interesting. Machi Koro [i]could be[/i] but [i]isn't[/i].

I bought into the hype that SU&SD had for this, and I really didn't see what they saw in it. It's basically Catan (with the die rolling aspects) and a deck builder like Dominion (with the... deck building aspects) It was okay? It was completely okay. But I don't like having games that are "just okay" in my library, so I got rid of it.

[thing=143884][/thing] is a very welcome, light, bone tossing filler with some interesting strategies that range from 'all in' to 'hedging your bets'. 

This game may be, naturally, compared to [thing=13][/thing] in the sense that they are both [b]dice rolling[/b], then collect resources/income based on the dice roll games. Rather than expanding your network on a board (like Settlers), each player in Machi Koro drafts cards ([b]card drafting[/b]) from a common pool and adds in to their own tableau. The cards drafted help the players earn income throughout the game, which is required to construct the necessary buildings to win.

Playing [thing=143884][/thing] is like being at a hot table of Craps in Vegas with lots of group cheering and upbeat energy!

A nice little city-building deck-building game.  It's is limited without the Harbors expansion and wouldn't buy the base game alone.

Eh, it's just okay.  Game can get lopsided pretty quickly with consecutive bad rolls on your turn.  Or you can have a huge boom and hit big each time.  You can also get targeted by thieves which can make it even harder to get anything started.

Feels too much like "Baby Catan" and I'm always on the lookout to replace the original Catan.  For Trade.

I need to stop listening to hype. The game a decent little quick game. Somewhat like a deck-builder, except with a die to determine which of your cards hit. And (almost) all of the cards are just about making money.

Settlers, stripped to the core resource gathering and turned into a dice-game (sort of). Cutesy art, reasonably priced and sized.

A cute little filler game, but it's very light and very random.  The way that the dice give you resources reminds me a lot of Catan, but it doesn't give you the same amount of depth, strategy, or fun.

I'd heard a lot of buzz for this game, so felt I had to try it out and ended up getting it as a birthday gift from my brother. It's a game that was right up our alley.

The game itself is relatively simple - roll the dice, collect income from your buildings that match what you rolled, and then buy a new building if you want (and can afford it). Eventually you try to earn enough to be the first to build 4 landmarks.

There is a lot of chance here, and it's really more a game about gambling than strategy. But it's a lot of fun if you just expect that you might have a string of bad luck.  A fun game for families, but not for the risk-averse.

No way to compete against Catan and C&K expansion. But still fun when needed to take a break from Catan. Problems: 1) limited number of card choices reduce replayability; 2) there's nothing you can do to counter the "Cafe" card; 3) randomness of dice roll seem to be more determinant than Catan.

Great game! Very reliant on dice. You roll for resources (gold) just like in Settlers of Catan. It's pretty much a deck-building game, but it's all out on the table instead of in your hand.

Was interesting to play for a short while but sadly a 5 player game turned into a 'yawn-fest' as I got stitched by the dice rolls and just passed the time waiting for somebody else to win.
It is clear that the expansion has altered the value of some of the original cards so that they are wrongly priced - poor design.
I suppose as a light game it would be OK but it took far far too long to be a filler.

Build your city by buying new cards from a panel of 10 different types of buildings. Each building has a specific financial effect. Some cards generate money in your own turn, others in anyone's turn, and yet others in individual other players' turns. Players depend on the throw of the dice, which can lead to some frustrating rounds in which one can't do anything.

I guess I was expecting more?  Then I played it.  It was a lot of fun.  I'm partial to engine building/economic snowball games, so I really enjoyed it.  I can't wait to play it more.  I didn't feel like the decisions were obvious, although the overall strategy of only rolling one die seemed to jump out, but I doubt this will be dominant as we play the game more and try other things.  I can see this getting old rather quickly, as the short play time will see this getting table frequently until it is "played out."  But I've read that there are at least a couple of expansions so this might alleviate that problem if it should ever occur.

An added plus, I can play it with the kids.  They can grasp the concepts, and the length is within their attention span.

Damn the dice to hell. This game is totally about getting lucky when activating your cards. In our 4 player game, I built what I thought would have gotten income but didn't. Making matters worse, I ended up always rolling a 3 to pay everyone else at the table on my turn. Not too much later, I find myself with no money and no one rolling my numbers of a single six sided die. Without any way to work out of the hole, I was forced to endure the rest of this luck fest until someone one. Would not recommend unless your idea of gaming is a Vegas slot machine.

I do enjoy playing this game, but it does get stale quickly. I have not yet expanded the game, but there seems to be only a couple dominant strategies (and the dice determine which of them will win every game). Would love to see some more feasible strategies. 

It does not play fantastic with 2 players... Playing with 2 players basically leads to both players hoarding different types of cards (ranches and cheese factory, forests and furniture factory, etc) and whoever gets a lucky roll first wins. I think it needs some kind of victory condition at the end to mitigate the impact of one lucky roll.

I honestly think with optimal play the game is just horribly broken and takes waaaaay longer than the advertised 30 minutes.

There are so many rolls where no income is generated, and instead it is just passed around among players.  No one dares save $$ across rounds because it just gets stolen, so this drags the game on because it's a generally bad strategy to save up for city upgrades.  

The strategy is paper thin, and while there is nothing wrong with that, this game can be painfully long.  The harbor expansion can make this already broken game even longer. 

Play Kings of Tokyo instead.

Great 20-25 minute game.  Multiple strategies to try, although I haven't quite figured out an optimal one.  Very slick, quick game.  We never play just one game at a time.  I'm hoping for an expansion to add card variety, but even without it, it is an easy go-to game for almost anyone, non-gamers as well.  My 8-year old loves it and it is one of the very few games my wife will play.  A must-have for a game collection.

While I like the light engine building aspect of Machi Koro, I still prefer other light filler like [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37380/roll-through-ages-bronze-age]Roll through the Ages[/url] more. I can't really put my finger on the reason for this, but somehow we always had some rounds in Machi Koro where there wasn't much progress and the game stalled a little bit.

This is a very light game, but fun. I highly recommend playing with the shuffle and deal until you have ten buildings variant from the Harbor expansion. Can feel a little long for what it is and it is heavily luck dependent. Both of these things mean this game has a bit of a limited shelf life.

RATING: 3
Everyone loves this game. Not a ton of depth but very fun dice-chucking, money-making action.

EDIT: Will probably drop below a 6 with further plays. Way too long for a game that is almost entirely luck. Really brings home the fact that in a small sample dice will not conform to probability. There will be way 'too many' of some numbers and very few of others. This will often lead to a run away leader problem.

Most sessions of MK are extremely boring.

It's ok with kids if you take out the two most expensive objectives to keep the length down.

Edit: There are much better games to play with kids. I'm glad the average on this has finally fallen below 7. I hope people continue to revise their ratings after more plays. MK makes a great first impression but soon becomes remarkably tedious. Glaring design flaws (clogging, runaway leaders, seemingly endless loop of money passing in the late game) quickly become apparent and have not been fixed with expansions. A very cute, very bad game.

Hopefully Card Kingdom of Valeria, Dice City, or another of the imitators will find a cleaner implementation of the 'shared dice/tableau activation' concept.

The art and theme drew me in, but the game itself is fast-paced and lots of fun! Quick enough to learn that it's been a big hit with my friends who prefer very lightweight games.

I highly recommend the Harbor expansion, which remedies this problem by limiting the available establishments to ten at a time, all randomly drawn.

Adorable little die rolling, money making game.  Players on their turn roll a die, which triggers income production off held cards (in Settlers of Catan fashion).  Every player can possibly earn income on any player's turn.  The player who rolled the die then may purchase a new card to add to their portfolio, or one of their four Landmark cards - which grant a power for the remainder of the game.

Brilliant little filler, instantly addictive and leaves you hungry for more.  Some tactics and strategies to explore too.

A very nice engine-building filler with excellent use of colors and art.   Will inevitably be reprinted and made widely available, but I hope that the art and look of the game remains untouched.   Dice rolling is used to generate money to buy cards from a center pool (shades of Dominion).   There is a fair amount of money stealing and the it takes up a lot of table space for such a quick and simple game - those are my only two minor complaints.   An unexpected hit for me.   It strips all of the work out of engine building and leaves behind only the fun.   (I'm surprised how many people compare this to Settlers.  I see why, but find that misleading).   

The 10-Pile variant is good for mixing the game up, and thwarting dominant strategies and 1-track-minded players.  Maybe adds a little length to the game but can be worth it in that situation.

Machi Koro is a strange beast. The game is random on extreme levels, your victory entirely decided by the dice. Your decisions are generally split into two broad categories: reduce risk for minimal reward or increase risk for greater reward, the former being more successful unless the latter pulls off a number of lucky rolls.

Despite this, there is an undeniable level of fun to the game. Perhaps it's the playful art style or the satisfaction of setting up your city so that you win very big on a certain roll and then getting that roll three times in a row. Depth may be minimal, but you'll still find some goodness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This rocks (but only with the Harbour Expansion for more than one or two replays). A true gateway game and everyone I've introduced it to has loved it. Doesn't get a huge amount of big ups from reviewers but you need to play it a few times to really get the depth of what's going on. And the theme and mechanics integrate beautifully. Would be a 9 with the Harbour Expansion.

First play of the base game was with the Harbor expansion, and that gets a rating of 4. Rating of 5 is a guess based on how it would work without the expansion. Engine-building snowball problems appear due to limits on interaction. Tactcial decisions aren't rewarded at the end of your turn. Strategic decisions are rewarded randomly. The harbor expansion's 10-stack limit means some players will get uneven access to the cards they want, leading to a stalled engine.

Machi Koro. WOW! What a game. Sometimes at Essen there is hype generated by scarcity (this year 2013 with Patchistory), sometimes there is hype generated by something innovative (Tzolk'in), sometimes by a near-universally acclaimed great game (Terra mystica), and sometimes, just sometimes, all three join together into an unstoppable gaming phenomena which takes the world by storm (think Love Letter). I would not be in any way surprised if Machi Koro follows this path. It is a gem. 

Part Settlers (dice determine the cards which are actioned), part Dominion (buildings are bought and form a deck but which is constantly in play via your tableau), part The City, but actually none of these as it feels so refreshingly new. 

It plays in 30 minutes max but time flies by and so it feels really really fast. And there is always something to do: on others' turns you may be taking money from the bank if their roll activates your building, or you may be stealing from them, and on your turn a whole host of actions become possible as your city grows. Yes it is true that the outcome is determined by dice, but you determine which dice rolls work in your city and you manage your own probabilities. And after playing a couple of games you realise how cleverly the card numbers and probabilities are worked out. 

I could go on but suffice to say it is a game which brings a smile to the face just thinking about it. Nothing I can think of packs so much punch into so short a time. And that's enough for me. One final comment: this will get picked up by a major publisher but let's just hope we get to see the lovely fresh artwork and that it isn't ruined in a Trains or Coup fashion.

It's like the center card market of Dominion mixed with the die-rolling-for-effect-ness of Catan, but without the annoying bits of either. Highly random and super simple. It's a really nice light game.

However, the first expansion really should be rolled into the base game. Without it, it feels like getting the Dominion base set if it came with only one of the "recommended beginner" lists.

Machi Koro feels like taking the first phase of some larger game and making an entire game out of it.  That's not to speak ill of it, either; instead of putting together several clever mechanics together to form a larger game, this one is all centered around one clever mechanic and all the ways it determines what happens on the board.  Great fun, plays quick.

This game is both fun and annoying.  It's fun when you're always able to do stuff when you're turn rolls around.  It's annoying when your aren't coming up and people are snatching your money left and right.  Regardless of the outcome, I always feel empty and unsatisfied at the end.  

I enjoy the Bright Lights setup a lot better.  A decent variety of numbers will always be on the table, and the take that cards are limited to two stacks making harder to build up a steal from everyone else tableau.  It feels like a lot of the wrinkles have been ironed out, and what is left is pure gambling fun.  My rating might be a 7 or 8 now.  I'll have to give it a few more plays to be sure.

Machi Koro is a fun light-weight tableau building game where players are competing to build up their cities the fastest.  There is a lot of luck in the game as dice rolls pretty much decide what is going to happen.  

However, there is enough decision making in the game as players have a choice in terms of what cards they want to buy to combo with the other available cards and best cover the dice rolls.  Players also must decide if they want to progress to rolling 2 dice or stay at 1.    

I truly feel the game benefits tremendously with the Harbor expansion or should at least be played with the  setup style in the expansion (starting with 10 unique stacks of buildings).  This way the available buildings at the start are always different, thus changing up the available strategies each game.  

The game plays in around an hour and although it may start a little bit slower, the dice rolls near the end are always highly anticipated, and are often accompanied with cheers and groans.  If luck doesn't bother you and you aren't looking for something deeper, this game is highly recommended!

Still early days, but we have been enjoying this game quite a bit, the wife and I. We play in 2 phases: in phase 1 we play as normal, trying to buy the major development cards for the win. Once one of us has done that, we play phase 2; first person to $50 wins. It keeps it interesting, and it allows you to use the system you have built up, whereas when you only play phase 1, by the time you have built up a nice little tableau, the game is over! 

This game has a tacked on theme, and the #6 cards are nasty, so we avoid them. The card stock isn't great, but since all the action is with the dice anyway, maybe it won't matter. Fun little game, looking forward to getting the harbour expansion.

RATING: 6
Quick, light, easy to teach game with appealing graphics.  Few interesting strategy decisions; may be too luck-driven for some tastes.  Not all cards offer the same expected return for the price; possibly a game balance issue for the math impaired; also a fair number of cards seem very unbalanced.  A good gateway game or filler. The harbor expansion absolutely is needed to maintain interest; Millionaire's Row expansion adds a few useful cards, but is mostly worthless.  Rating a 5 without the expansion; with the Harbor expansion, 6.

Update: Arrggh!! Arrggh!! Arrggh!!  Too much $@&^*#)% luck!!  Update update:  you can play well or you can play poorly, but the dice will determine whether you win.  Frustratingly luck dependent.  Further update:  EGAD!  This game can be extremely frustrating due to the luck factor.  Strongly considering trading.  Arrggh!

Update update update:  I've relaxed a bit.  This game can be fun once you accept that die rolls can defy probability for a long time.

Without the harbor, try randomly populating the market before the game by rolling a die for each type of establishment; on a 1-2 place one fewer than the number of players, on a 3-4 place establishments equal to the number of players, and on a 5-6 place one more than the number of players.

RATING: 2
Super super random. Very little control as to how much you effect the game. The die is king, all hail the die. Pretty much each turn you can go anywhere from paying money to everyone else to collecting tons of money, all are valid options depending on a six sided die. Probably should be a 1, but at least its kinda quick.

Good gateway, but gets boring pretty quickly as you learn the different combinations that work.

It's a game that I'll only take out with beginner gamers, but I've already had a strategy that beats them every time. The luck factor just isn't enough to make the game fair & even. 

Once everyone is familiar with the game, it's usually time to move along to something else. Similar mechanic to Splendor - but I would pick Splendor every time.

Welcome to the city of Machi Koro. You've just been elected Mayor. Congrats! Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.

Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!

Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on his own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than his rivals. On his turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, he gets the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of his city on future turns. The first player to construct all of his landmarks wins!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Machi Koro is a simple and elegant game. You roll dice and get money according to the result. With that money you can buy more cards that give you more money. You can start an engine by combining different cards. Very enjoyable game. I would like to try the Harbour Expansion.

I have been told the expansion fixes a major problem with this game: the strategic choice of never upgrading to rolling 2 dice is (was) too strong in the base game.

This game needs at least one expansion added onto it to shine. Otherwise, it's very easy to play towards the statistical probability of the dice and steamroll your opponents. The expansions make the available cards randomized, so it's much harder to pick up cards that will get activated frequently.

Great little dice game, that is so simple to explain and play, but highly enjoyable. Improved enormously by playing with the 10-deck variant, which helps to prevent players picking a certain strategy each time (eg Cheese Factory).

RATING: 8.5
Dice-rolling city-building game.  Machi Koro is reminiscent of both Settlers (roll a dice and collect coins) and Dominion (buy new cards).  No spatial element, and no trading; some take-that and randomness, and possibly limited replay without an expansion, but it's a fantastic light dice-rolling game that plays in 15-20 minutes.

One play. Seems like it would get same-y very quickly once you figure out the basic strategy but I guess the randomness of dice would keep you coming back to keep trying. I got hosed in my one game by rolling a 6 five friggin turns in a row (with one and two dice!) with nothing produced for the roll. There's definitely an arc you need to keep up with and little you can do to catch up if you get left behind.

I have only played with the integrated harbour expansion which I believe changes the game significantly as cards are shuffled together and there is a river of 10 to buy from rather than a tableau of cards a la dominion style.

Actually I quite like this. The four card types (blue, green, red and purple) are actually quite clever and especially the red (steal card) and blue (make money) cards trigger in any turn when their number is rolled therefore you do watch what other people are doing.

The end game race to build condition feels a little forced but I am not sure what other mechanic for end game could have been added as there are plenty of cards and we only saw a fraction of them so playing through the deck would drag this out considerably.

Summary: Ultra-light economic engine game with cutesy kawaii graphics: the UNO of euros.

Rating history:
1st play: :star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:
2nd play: :star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:
3rd play: :star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar:

2p - Not interesting.
4p - Too long: coins get stolen often.

1st play: DEC/14. I read the rules and knew what to expect, but even with that prep, this game was lighter than I expected. Go for a nice spread of numbers or focus on a few with big payouts. I really need to try this again with less than 4p. 4p wasn't much fun even within the context of the game.

I feel that with the expansion and the 10-card draft, this game would be much more to my tastes. At that point though, it's a $45 (online prices!) game.

3rd play: DEC/14. Lowered rating to one star. Without an expansion and draft mode, this game isn't even interesting as filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
A speedy, card drafting game, and a good gateway game for Valeria.  It's all about money that is determined by the roll of the dice, but offset by satisfying and easily grasped, strategy.  It's good to know the cards & card combos, so I am looking forward to repeated play.  Might even buy this game.

Dice rolling game with the luck element inherent in this method, but by building a balanced portfolio you can keep money coming in to buy more cards.  Quick to explain and pick up so it's good for family gatherings or friends who are not really into games.
There are a few different strategies to try out.
The box is unnecessarily big for what is essentially a pack of cards - you can easily put the component parts in your handbag or pocket so it's a good game to take on holidays.

This is a very simple and easy game to pick up.  IMO, it seems almost too simple.  My housemate and I don't play 2 players anymore.  We discovered a win every time unless you have VERY bad luck strategy with 2 players.  And it really is whoever gets to it first.  There isn't much of a way for one of us to stop the other once they go for it.  So that's a downside.  Otherwise, a fairly nice game.  You don't need to be a game nerd to enjoy this one.

Un juego que no para de recibir palos en la BSK pero que a nosotros nos encanta y nos ha hecho pasar muy buenos ratos. Claro que tiene azar, pero también se pueden tomar decisiones importantes a la hora de acudir al mercado.
Su mecánica principal recuerda mucho al Catán, pero sinceramente, me quedo con éste. Su efecto bola de nueve y la velocidad frenética a la que se juega lo hacen mucho más ameno para mí. Ojalá saliesen más expansiones en castellano.

I'm fascinated that a few folks rate this game a perfect "10."    There is just so little game here.  I love the production values and the game is a fun, light simplified Catan.   I give it a "7" instead of a 5 or 6 because of the production values and because my 6 yr old daughter likes it and can play reasonably well as I try to move her from "kids games" to "real games."  MK is a nice step in that direction.    

BTW, this game is not a "Deck Builder."  You only have the cards you have purchased in your tableau and then you roll dice and buy more.   This game is much more closely related to a self-published game called "In the City: Origins."   If you like this sort of Tableau builder then you should check out "In the City" --as there is much more strategy and no dice.  (one downside- the production values of "In the City" are quite low, with public domain art that sometimes doesn't seem to really have anything to do with the particular card it is illustrating).

My 11yo daughter is obsessed with this game. It's exciting to see her strategize, and while the game does often hinge on the roll of the dice, there's a strategy to covering your bases. Do you want to play Aggro or the Long Game? While the expansions leave a little to be desired, there's some nice mechanics of property selection we've adopted in the regular game now that makes it more interesting.

Interesting mix between engine building, leeching and hurting others. A lot of randomness but still charming, and the random rolls actually feel meaningful since they're very simple: I roll a 4 I win, and I've got a re-roll so I get a 1/3 chance of winning. And yet there's a surprising amount of strategy, and group think to boot!

It's a tad too slow to be a 7, or a tad to light. But if it could be played simultaneously then the game would be a 7 or even an 8 for me.

Base game was ok, but each expansion adds too many cards and the suggest market mechanism leaves a lot to be desired. I'm still trying to work out a variant that will make it good. Obviously it's just a luck based game anyway, so there's not much that changes that but the market system with the expansions changes it from I'll buy x card because it matches my strategy to, I'll buy x card because it's the best one available and all I can afford.

A harmless filler-type game, sort of an aggressively stripped-down Settlers of Catan. A few different paths to pursue, yet strongly dependent on dice rolls, but also over in 20 minutes and therefore not much of an issue.

I strongly prefer the variant with the random market that was first introduced in the expansion to the standard form of play in the base game where all cards are available right from the start.

Im Grunde ist MACHI KORI ein komprimiertes, auf den Kern von MONOPOLY gebrachtes MONOPOLY: man latscht mit dem Würfel auf Häuser (Karten) bekommt Geld (Miete) oder zahlt Geld (Miete) und versucht über den Kauf von Karten (Häusern) seine Einnahmen (Miete) zu erhöhen. Wer zuerst vier Prestigeobjekte in seiner Stadt gebaut hat, hat gewonnen. MACHI KORI zeigt, wie langsam Spiel zu Zeiten von MONOPOLY gedacht wurde und wie sehr sich das digitale Zeitalter der Komprimierung von Datenmenge auch im Brettspiel widerspiegelt und die Geschwindigkeit forciert. Als MACHI KORI macht MONOLOPY richtig Laune: ein schnelles, trashiges Glücksspiel, das gleichzeitig Städtebauspiele auf die Schippe nimmt wie in einer Kindersendung auf Kika. Das vollendete Glück an der Oberfläche der Spielewelt sich zu bewegen, nimmt dieser klassische Absacker im liebevollen japanischen Art-Direction-Kimono dabei gerne in Kauf.

I feel slightly disappointing by this game. While I love the artwork...and the game design is good enough...It just left me wanting more. More cards to choose from, more build up...more player interaction.  I am entertaining the idea of getting some expansions for this, and hopefully it will improve for me...as it is now, it just feels bland.

Edit: I have lowered the score from a 7 to a 5. While I am still completly charmed by the artwork, I just find this game to be too boring and random. When my collection starts to get too big for my shelves, this will probably be one of the first to go.

RATING: 5
It's a light, fun game. Play it with your non-gamer friends. There are some different strategies to try out but don't expect too much of it.

I recommend playing this with slightly different rules. Instead of having all cards available, make three decks. One contains all cards that activate on 1-6, one all cards that activate on 7-14 and one all purple ones. Draw from each deck until you have two different purple cards and 5 (4 if you're playing 1v1) different from the other two decks available (put multiple copies of a card in one pile). This is your market place. Refill up to the same amount of different cards as needed.

Without the expansion this will get boring FAST.

PS: The table space needed for this tiny game is RIDICULOUS.

Within a few plays this becomes transparent as a race for a starter set that will give you something on almost every pip first. Toss in one or two red "take that" cards to slow the opponents, then race for combo sets... and cross fingers. 

Any perceived "strategy" where you are banking on one particular range or combo of pips will mostly fail and occasionally pay off (so basically it's an illusion of a strategy). That's it.  All of the randomness of Catan in less time.  Yay?

Particularly boring with two players. 

I wish some of the gushing video reviewers of this game had played it more than a couple of times before praising the emperor's new clothes quite so much (I'm looking at you Shut Up & Sit Down). It's just ok, in my opinion. I would play [thing=70323][/thing] over this any day.

The Harbor expansion is not a panacea for the mediocrity of the core game. It takes the randomness and cranks it up to 11 with a random building market, transforming a mostly innocuous humdrum game from amusing trash to intolerably drawn out, pseudo-strategic trash.

Red cards are a$$holes.

The artwork combined with its simplicity make it very approachable to casual gamers. However, the game suffers from a rich get richer problem. If you don't get a decent engine going early you've pretty much eliminated yourself from winning the game. This can be a very big turn off.

This is about as light of a game as it gets.  There isn't a large amount of strategy to it, but the colourful art and simple rules means it will probably get played a lot more than the heavier games.

I use a variant marketplace of randomized piles where copies of the same card get stacked up on each other as they are revealed.  

This game has some design and balance issues (that the expansions deal with) - but despite it all, it's simple, the art is great, the theme is engaging and it's always fun, win or loose.  This is not a heavy euro, but for a lighter family friendly game it gives you lots of interesting choices.

The theme of Machi Koro is ostensibly city building, but I would argue that die rolling is its own theme in board gaming, and this applies here.  You certainly won't feel like you just grew your city by adding a bakery, for example --it's just another roll to get income (similar to Settlers of Catan). 

While the luck of die rolling is by far the biggest element to this light filler, there are statistically several areas that make the game more interesting than just rolling dice (for example, "upgrading" your city to roll two dice, changing both the distribution and available outcomes.  No amount of skill will overcome luck though, so if you tend to either: dislike rolling dice to do well, or dislike luck playing a large part in determining the winner, you may want to avoid this.

If you know much about statistics, you may find yourself actually calculating the value of cards under each path (one die/two dice) to optimize your buy pattern (assuming you get income from your die rolls).  However, because individual players may make suboptimal decisions, a player can hurt themselves while hurting you.

The quality of the components is below average, but not terribly so.  There's also a lot of air in the box, perhaps making you think there's more to the game than just a deck of cards, 2 dice, and some money tokens.  Or maybe it's an attempt to make room for expansions, turning this light filler into a potentially more expensive and profitable game.

If you enjoy rolling dice to find out if you succeed,  or playing around with probabilities to optimize strategy, you might find this game a bit addictive.  There aren't a lot of cards or strategic possibilities, but this is the first game I've seen take the approach of adding dice to change the distribution of outcomes, potentially for all the players.  As a filler, I think it succeeds, although I wish the cards were a little sturdier, there were more interesting cards to buy, and the strategy more developed.

As anything more than a filler, I think it fails, simply because die rolling, especially early in building up your engine, really makes the strategic aspect minimal in comparison to the luck.  As an all ages game that can include younger children, I think this is good.

RATING: 6
Like Catan except you build your own tablue of cards rather than expanding on a board - abilities/resources on the cards are triggered by the dice rolls.

There is an ability to expand and use 2 x dice to access a wider range of buildings but this appears to be a losing strategy as the turns required to obtain all the resources needed to obtain all the additional buildings to cover the numbers 7 to 12 is way to long and your single dice opponent will have won easily - hopefully the expansion will address this.

Dice rolls will aid and hinder you and can determine the outcome so VERY luck dependant. Light, quick. Ok bits.

I like it - don't love it.  obviously a lot of luck involved, but don't get confused - it definitely is not all about that.  You need to build something that has the chance to net you a bunch of coins at some point to actually buy your expensive buildings.  Small, incremental engines don't see to work here.

I'll be curious if it can take on more of an engine building feel with all the expansions, and then choose 10 cards at random and try to find combos.  I'd be much more interested there.

One five-player game with the expansion. Not sure if it was the expansion's fault or the fact that there were five players, but the game was quite long and not very interesting. Money was constantly being handed back and forth, making it impossible to plan from one turn to the next. Overall seems like a weak Dominion rip-off with cute illustrations.

Has some of the charm of the Settlers board game. Better than the Settlers card game. Begs an expansion to add variety. Jan 2015

*UPDATE* 10th time playing and first time my partner has joined in. It is ages since we all got together around the dining room table and this was the perfect game for the occasion. Upping my rating from a 6 to an 8 but only if I am adding in the expansion and I will not be wasting the time of gamers proposing we play this as it will be too random for them. March 2015

Simple, colorful gateway game that is easy to teach and play. It's so based on the dice rolls that it might frustrate the most cerebral players, but my family loved it!

It comes in a box that is far too big for the components inside. I've heard good things about the expansions but I wouldn't like it to get too big, as it would make it harder to transport, teach and set up.

I previously felt the game was broken—really after my first and second plays. Despite that, I bought the game because of its beautiful motifs and because the gameplay was adequate.

That said, I tired of it because of what I considered to be a Halifax Hammer-type game breaking strategy. In my first games, I purchased as many gear-symbol cards as I could and then bought as many factory cards as I could. As soon as I or someone else upgraded to 2 dice, I was able to occasionally generate a lot of revenue (I remember receiving 42 money in one die roll once).

I think I may have mistakenly given Machi Koro short shrift. With strong players, the game balances much more easily as I found out yesterday (7/29/2015). Also, the expansion does use some randomization to ensure a different balance and gameplay style is necessary each time the game hits the table.

Good game.

The worst part of playing this was that you have to pay attention during other people's turns (in case their die roll affects you) but you don't really *care* (because like all outcomes in the game, it's just luck).

I played a version printed elsewhere that came in a tiny box and was obviously supposed to be fluffy. I can only imagine the disappointment I would have felt had it been marketed as a medium-weight game the way it is in the US.

Its okay.  The components kind of suck, ESPECIALLY the oversized box.  WAY too expensive, The game really should just be in a card deck box like star realms.

For a light filler this is a nice game.  Constructing buildings to play the odds in a specific way is a nice way of mitigating the randomness of the dice which can be satisfying even if the game is 99% luck.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Filler molt simple on es tracta de construir abans que la resta de jugadors un cert nombre d'elements. Al principi del torn es llançen dos daus i s'activen els "poders" de cada jugador que coincideixin amb el resultat del dau (normalment, cobrar o robar monedes). Després es construeixen més cartes de un pool comú que afegeixen més poders.

Molt atzar, la generació de recursos al estil Catan em sembla poc interessant... Sembla que hi ha un important factor "snowball" (es a dir, un cop un jugador es destaca després resulta imposible agafarlo).

Machi Koro is a really fun game to play a few times. Having only played twice, I already get the sense of sameness and the need for more and more expansions. Not in a good way, (because you love it so much). More in the way that it would start to feel very stale without them.

That caveat aside, I really do enjoy the way this game works. You are rolling dice, drafting cards, and building an engine towards acquiring the really big stuff. Certain die rolls affect your opponents too, but other rolls do not. The cards are well-illustrated and it moves along at a nice pace. Definitely worth a play or two, but I can't vouch for the longevity.

Nice concept and art, but promised more fun than it delivered, mainly because early luck is important, and it's very much a "rich get richer" game where an early lead can become unstoppable. There is no balancing mechanism for players at an early disadvantage to recover, and no way for players to effectively gang up on a runaway leader either. So, overall, not a well designed game. I'm not saying this from sour grapes because I was the runaway leader in this game ...  One other player could do nothing on three consecutive turns, another player had his (very few) coins stolen which deprived him of the opportunity to buy buildings. Note: this comment is based on a single play with only the base game. But I can't be doing with games that are badly designed from the outset and require an expansion to play well, so will be unlikely to play again with the expansions to see if it plays better.

A light-medium game which has a clean mechanic.  There is a bit of "take that" (Coffee and purple buildings).  Players gradually build up their Town, and the first to complete the construction of 4 pre-set buildings (everyone has the same 4) wins.

There is some randomness, but it can be mitigated by the cards you purchase, which trigger on different numbers, and may or not not trigger on other players turns.

A nice filler to end a game day, or while you wait for players to arrive.  30-45 minutes.

A simple dice game that involves rolling dice to see what triggers on your turn, you and maybe others acquiring benefits depending on what was rolled, and using money to acquire more buildings that increase your possible benefits.

I don't like games that try to be both strategic yet benefit from directly screwing other people over.  Let alone that these screwing-over decisions are not made strategically, or even tactically, but rather by a roll of the dice.  There is no way to really mitigate your luck, no catch-up mechanisms, and a nasty runaway leader problem.

Stone Age mitigates luck by letting you assign the number of dice as well as the target resource.  Most Euros for that matter allow you to make tactical decisions that can be risky but pay off handsomely.  Any choice you try to make here is reliant upon lucky or unlucky dice rolls, and I would guess that in most cases, the first person to get a shopping mall is going to be the victor.

Felt like Ameritrash without the fun.

Machi Koro is a cute little, dice driven game that has some strategy as well as luck.

Players roll, and cards matching the roll activate, generally providing money to the rolling player, but sometimes to all players.

There are certain combos which are more effective, with good rolls, so players will want to watch anyone aiming for a fools mate and build leetches.

Players build monuments and establishments. Monuments give special powers, and completing all monuments is the game end trigger.

It's a quick playing dice and card game, with fun fairly abstract art.

Not bad. It's like Suburbia light, but with the resources generated by a kind of settlers like mechanic. So it all sounds good right?

Fun combination of card and dice game - I don't really like dice games, but Machi Koro made the cut. Might well make it outside Japan in the near future.

Update after trying the new Kosmos edition: Yes, this game works really well. An instant hit with my wife as well, I expect us to bring this out once in a while. 
But what on earth happened to Kosmos? Somebody must have passed out during the translation and the proofreading process. I don't just mean the ridiculous plural of Stadion, but the style of the card texts is also rather awkward if you ask me. For a game that will sell hundreds of thousands of copies (great value, after all), this isn't such a good idea in my opinion. But the rules are easily understandable, so no problems from that side.

(10/19/2014) Comment based on one play and one abandoned play.

This is a light, trivial, random, economic snowball exercise in boredom and frustration. It is perfectly suited and family-friendly to newbies and casual gamers that enjoy the randomness of Settlers, triviality of Munchkin, and card buying of Dominion, but offers little to veteran gamers and has very little replay value.

Our first game started out innocently enough, rolling a die, getting money (sometimes), and then buying buildings. Two of us ended up buying the Stadium (hits on a 6), and then proceeded to roll sixes on our turn, stealing from the third player, who was then perpetually broke all the time. We called the game right there. Strike one medium/heavy gamer off the fan list. Conclusion: lousy rolls equals lousy game. This was beginning to remind me of Kingsburg, which is another horridly random design, but the cuteness and frivolity kept me interested and willing to give it one more shot.

We played a second game to completion. One player quietly and quickly bought all of the ranches (hits on a 2), while another bought most of the forests (hits on a 5). Through great struggle, I bought most of the grocer stores (hits on a 4). In this game, I was the one who couldn't roll a "4" to save my butt. The player with the ranches then bought most of the mines (hits on an 8), before getting the second die. At that point, it was meaningless for me to get the cheese factory (hits on a 7), since I only had one ranch. From that point it was an economic snowball, and there was very little to do but wait for the sweet release of death to this boring, frustrating design. Thankfully, it only lasted 30 minutes, but this was 25 minutes too long. Started out cute, but got nasty and pointless after 10 minutes. Strike two medium/heavy gamers off the fan list.

It is an interesting, simple design, that is clean, and seemingly fun to play, with cute art and graphics. But, there are few meaningful decisions to be made, and most of it is scripted and decided by how the die falls (on every player's turn). There are limited buildings, and the point is to "cover your numbers" on the 2D6 bell curve of Settlers. You will start with a 1D6, so there is no curve at first, but a quick dash to get as many 2s first, then possibly 4s, then 5s, since these make you money on anybody's turn. Getting a farm (hits on a 1) is okay when rolling 1D6, but then is out if you start rolling 2D6, so why bother? The ranch hits on a 2 and costs the same, so this is a no-brainer. Then, if you have enough cash, start buying the 7s and 8s, which are dependent on the number of 2s and 4s that you have. The stadium hits on a 6 and steals from others, but seems pointless, since most players will be spending as much as they can. Then, get the second die, and you have covered the most probable numbers. If you hit first, then it is economic snowball from there. Rinse and repeat. It is a "6", with room to go down quickly, unless we get an expansion, because the base game's buildings don't provide enough range of strategies.

(02/21/2015) The Harbor Expansion definitely saves this borderline broken game. The larger variety of buildings, along with a completely new way of introducing them into the game, are necessary fixes. With the expansion, it is now somewhat enjoyable and fun to play. However, due to the new way where only 10 building types can come out at any given time, the game has a rather slow start. Then, there is a knee in the curve, and the game goes into overdrive, full of large swings in income, and abruptly ends. Not bad, but not great. Somewhat overstays its welcome by 20-30 minutes. The base game is now a "2", as in I'll never play it again, but with the expansion, it is a "7".

Pretty good when played occasionally and briskly as a social gambling game* akin to craps; less good when played too much, like twice in a row or even the next day.  It's a big, fat, grocery store cupcake that's mostly greasy frosting; you know that while one might be okay, two or three will just make you feel gross.  So, less is more here, on all axes:  [i]session length, number of plays in a week, expectations[/i].

It's best when played as a party game with chanting and fist-pumping and exultation or slumping shame and mock table-flipping.  And lots and lots of storytelling about precisely how so-and-so bankrupted themselves by eating at every family restaurant in the tri-state area in a single, terrible evening.

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  Better with the [thing=143789]Harbor Expansion[/thing], though you'll want to use the [thread=1315037]3 Deck/12 Pile variant[/thread] for that.

[size=7]*Not that you're risking ostracism if your number doesn't hit, and, yes, I realize there are no actual stakes—or at least not ones you're aware of while rolling those godforsaken dice.[/size]

I have very few gamers in my immediate entourage. This game falls into the right niche, I have a great time with it and it will see the table with my relatives. Machi Koro is a fun engine builder with a great theme. The catan-like feeling is extraordinary for my peers who enjoy those classic and I really like seeing my town becoming more and more efficient.

Recently received this as a gift and have played it quite a bit with the family.  The kids love this game.  The mechanics are simple enough that my 8-year old really likes it.  Unfortunately, some of the strategy is a bit over his head, so he doesn't really do very well. You really have to have a good idea of value; when is the right time to buy the second die and when should you actually roll it?  Is it better to have one card covering every possible die roll or is it better to really throw everything at just a few combinations and wait for them to trigger?

My wife and I enjoy playing it with the kids and trying to teach them some of that strategy...up until now, though, I don't think the kids have won any of the games.  They've come in second plenty of times (dice rolling helps to mitigate some of the strategy) and that is keeping them interested enough to want to try again.

For my wife and I, I could see the game getting a little stale after repeated playthroughs.  It seems like there are only a few really viable strategies and once those are mastered, it may turn into a "going through the motions"-type of experience.  I may look into the expansions to see what they add to it.

The resource generation works like Settlers; roll a die and see what you get.  It's also a little like Dominion because you buy cards and add them to your empire.  The decision of when to switch to two dice is an interesting one.  I wish the game had more cards instead of using all of the every game.  (1 game)

I really want to like this game. In fact, I usually enjoy playing it for the first 3/4 of the game.  Then, invariably, the endgame comes down to who gets that one lucky roll that pushes them over the top.  There doesn't seem to be a reward for good choices. Perhaps an expansion will fix this?

I enjoy playing this game; I am not opposed to being subjected to luck of the dice.  The dice mechanic feels very similar to Catan. The cute, clean art and straight-forward rules make it more accessible to kids, and the game is a good intro lesson to probability.

After playing Machi Koro Deluxe, this version of the game isn't as fun. After two or three plays, it's easy to figure out a strategy. Once you're in the lead, it's easy to stay in the lead and win the game. The graphics and color scheme are nice and it's a fun game if you have 30 minutes to spare, but I prefer the Deluxe version which requires a bit more thinking and strategy.

A fun little game of its type, where rolling dice gives you money to buy stuff that gives you more money and so forth.

Fun little game but doesn't have much replay value as there isn't really any kind of randomization element to keep people from just buying the same exact cards every time.

July 2015:

Not sure exactly how strategic the base game is, but it is fun to build up and root for that exact number you need.

I'm hoping the expansion will mix it up; especially as it has you only see a random subset of cards at a time.

Dec 15:

Expansion did not really save the day.  It improved variety, and stopped some AP, but it also showed that this just isn't that interesting.

Might work as a non-gamer thing, but that's not what I want.

Won in a giveaway, plus it's a game I can demo via Envoy program, but I'm just not interested in it at all. I mean, the art's nice, component quality is alright too, that insert sort of blows, everything falling all over when you store it one it's side. I think it's the having to lay out all those stacks of cards so everyone can choose them is the turn-off (there are variants for that, but as I'd likely be demo-ing the game I couldn't use them).

After a second play it's fallen from "meh" to actively offensive. Randomly losing stuff feels awful, and rolling a 3 early on when people have been buying tea shops can set you back by turns. It's not "broken" and it clearly has decisions, but the decisions aren't all that significant. Avoid.

(One play.) Highly random; the strategy seems to be along the lines of randomness mitigation, in whatever flavor you prefer. It's not offensively bad but I'm not clamoring for it.

Machi Koro is a light game with that offers players some interesting strategic choices that make it closer to gambling than any other "board game" that I've played. It can be a lot of fun when you are getting the rolls you need, and I really enjoy building up my town, but the luck can also make it somewhat frustrating.  The art is just okay in my opinion, and the cards are low quality. 

Update: The added the Harbor expansion, which really adds to the game and improves the game play and replay ability.  All plays going forward will be with the expansion.

Very light game that manages to take up a lot of space.  Quick and fun.  I was actually surprised how much my friends liked it.  Sort of like a combination of Dominion (assuming you play with the variation where the cards are different each game) and Settlers (because you get stuff for rolling dice).  Fills a cool niche - not quite a filler but still plays in 20-30 minutes.  Same category as Splendor in terms of weight, maybe a big lighter.

Very nice idea for a game, and the art looks great, but predictably it's just not very good. 

With the strategy in the base game being too easy given that the setup is always the same, it just comes down to luck as to who wins.

The expansion 'fixes' the game with a more cards, and changes the game so that instead of dominion style where all decks are available at the start, the expansion puts all cards into one deck and only 5? random cards are available to be purchased at any one time.

So now as well as the game being a luck fest with the dice, they've now added another layer of luck in what cards you are able to buy on your turn.

I once heard someone say Machi Koro is a game built around the worst part of Catan: the luck of the dice rolls providing resources. Except now, collecting the most resources determines the winner of the game.

That's a very apt description. There really aren't any interesting decisions here. Players should just go for the building of their choice and hope the dice rolls fall their way to win.

Such simplicity might be fine for kids, but there are so many other great entry-level and filler games out there to choose from where players make decisions that actually matter.

was talked into playing thinking this was a "filler"... wrong... took way too long for what it is... too much "take that" (back and forth w/the money), dice are random (I rolled 7 four turns in a row, I should have been playing craps!), and too much to keep track of (every die/dice roll everyone has to check if they've got built cards that do something on the number rolled).

update: on a 2nd play I bumped my rating up from 5.5 to a 6.... don't know if it made a difference but was playing the published version this time vs print/play.  I won this time... but lots of folks were rolling 4's early on and I was the only one who got a coin on a 4 (in a 5 player game)

This game would play very differently with different numbers of players as the relative powers of the different cards are more or less useful with different player counts.  it is really an engine building game with dice to control what gets activated each turn (like Setters of Catan).

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2014)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had fun playing it. Machi Koro is a light game with lots of luck, but still fun. I feel part of the luck can be controlled so it doesn’t bother me much, however the game retains a high degree of uncontrollable luck no matter what you do. It also has a couple of interesting decisions (how many dice to roll?, what card to buy?) but they aren’t deep in any way. Reminiscent of Settlers of Catan and Dominion.

Easy to explain. The art is ok and the gameplay is good if players keep the game going at a fast pace, due to this I think it is best with 3 players, with four players there is downtime and the playtime is too long for what the game offers. Some cards are very powerful so I think there might be balance issues.

The game came in a big box with lots of wasted space (for the expansions perhaps?).
 
Bottom line, an ok family game I would play from time to time. Perhaps I will buy it in the future. 

Current Rating: 6.0

I bought the game last month because it was on sale. After more plays I’m enjoying it so for now I will keep it but I think the game needs an expansion urgently, each game has felt very similar and is only the uncontrollable luck which has brought some variability to our plays.

Also own Harbor and Millionaires' Row.  Not happy about the card size inconsistency.  We are currently trying variants to prevent market lock out.

We like 15 unique piles: 5 green, 4 blue, 3 red, and 3 purple.  So when a card is turned that is already on a pile, it goes on top of the other copy of itself to keep all piles unique.  If a pile runs out, then there are less piles to choose from.

Played the basic version of this game for the first time (i.e.-no added expansions).  I can see why the expansions were necessary... a long run of bad luck in a five player game can be devastating!

There appears to be a bit of a runaway leader problem, too.  And considering that there aren't enough disasters to mitigate the problem, it can make for a very long 90 minutes...

My 6 rating is being generous only because this was my first 'basic' game.

2015-01-22 - Machi Koro is a really nice light tableau building game. To me, it feels more like Dominion than a more traditional tableau builder like Race for the Galaxy, though.

2016-01-07 - I'm lowering my rating from a 7 to a 6. Machi Koro is a fine game, but it just takes longer than I would like.

This game succeeds well at its goal of being a light, quick, and enjoyable. There is enough happening to make for an entertaining session if it doesn't run too long. While the die rolls determine the heart of the outcome, you can set yourself up for success with a variety of strategies. It doesn't feel thematic or like you're really "doing" anything, but it delivers in the right mood.

Wow.  Machi Koro immediately jumps in to my top ten favorites.  I love this idea of building your city with cards and having everything come down to the roll of a die.  Begging and pleading with those dice to "pay" you has a fun appeal for me.  I also found that I'm really good at buying buildings that never pay me back.  That being said, it's a blast and a new favorite.

A delightful game that works well with non gamers. There's enough luck in the die rolls that give non gamers a chance against gamers although maybe gamers can mitigate the die rolls with better strategic play - need to play more to assess this. Needs quite a bit of table space to lay all the cards out.

Fast, easy to teach and play filler with cute art, little strategy and very high luck dependency. This game gets compared with [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/settlers-catan]The Settlers of Catan[/url]. I can see where this is coming from as you throw dice and get resources. This one might play a bit faster, but it misses that oh so important negotiation and trade aspect that Settlers has.

Ultimately, the game follows a very predictable path and is too luck dependent for the usual game night crew. Replayability with that crowd would also be very low. However, I like it as a family-weight building game to play with the kids. My 13-year-old son particularly enjoyed it.  Expansions add needed variety but also adds to game length. Might be best to add the Harbor expansion and call it quits. That's probably the best this game will get.

one play with 4 so far.  Very much enjoyed it.

Turns move very quickly and still maintains some level of involvment on other's turns, which makes for a very involved game from every player.

It can be difficult to remember to keep all of your bonuses straight-- especially near the end, but I think this will ease will more plays.

Overall, a very good game that goes over well with my kids, non-gamers, and even for gamers once in a while.  

looking forward to getting expansions to mix it up a little perhaps (or playing with the much discussed "epic" variant.)

RATING: 6
I'm torn whether I like Machi Koro or not. The artwork is appealing, it's a quick playing filler game. At first, there seem to be a few different building strategies to win. But after some games, I'm more annoyed than convinced. The culprit is the production roll of a single die. The worst part from Settlers is taken while essentially most of the elements to mitigate unlucky rolls are taken away. The only way to protect against bad luck is to spread cards across all numbers which in effect will be beaten by any focused strategy with the right rolls.

My wife loves the game, and I think it replaces Settlers of Catan for the light dice rolling resource gather elements it has. If I want a strategic Settlers, I play Terra Mystica, which I prefer, but I definitely don't mind this one. I'm just a little disappointed with the lack of variation. It seems like there's a winning strategy, with the only potential losses coming from statistically improbable rolls.

Thought it was going to be a Catan killer, but it end up being even worst than Catan.

Way too many aspect that make the game uninteresting. (Green cards too strong in 2 player, too weak in 4 player, clunky card synergy...), you can easily win the game sticking with 1 dice. Even with the unofficial 5-5-2 variant, the value of some card just doesn't seem to make sense, so you end up buying the same card anyway.

Also, very minimal player interaction, as if you're playing monopoly without a board. (You roll this number!? give me $2, and that's all there is between you and other player.)

Just as I had estimated beforehand, there isn't much of a game in the box. And in the case of IDW version the box is ridiculously oversized. The game is basically Settlers of Catan express. The board and most of the interaction has been stripped away. What interaction is left comes from depleting building stacks and some take that buildings. The game is also a lot more random than SoC. There's the engine building aspect, but you can still lose to sheer bad luck and most of the antagonism is just random.

Meih! It was a game that I wanted to like but played it with two players and in my opinion there is no game.

But on the other hand, when I have only 30 minutes there are much better games out there...

If you think that Settlers of Catan is as basic as it gets and that it can't be distilled any further... you haven't played Machi Koro.

It condenses the basic mechanism of Settlers into two dice and a pack of cards and squeees it into a very small time frame.

For such a simple gateway game I like it a lot. Worthy SdJ-nominee.

I enjoyed this more than I expected to. There are a few discoveries to be made regarding how buildings work together, whether by mathematics or simple observation, prompting purchases to prevent monopolies and in turn revealing other successful options, and one can imagine that after a number of such iterations you'd still have a non-trivial money engine game. Managing all the little random payouts is also less fiddly than it first appears. What holds the rating down for me personally is the fact that once potentially high-yielding investments are in place, the actual outcome can so easily and abruptly be determined by a couple of lucky rolls. The card-switching power also goes against the concept of getting to build your own slot machine.

Very pure dice roller.

The game's decent enough as a filler though not necessary for your collection if you have something even just remotely similar.

The main strategy is one I'm quite fond off: properly play into the decisions your fellow players make. Most importantly with regard to the double dice power.

I have heard the expansions are actually rather good.

There are lots of good dice rollers out there though... so I'd suggest you try this game and then move on to try some more. You'll find the one you like. And hey, perhaps it's this one :)

The cards themselves are cute (as is the game’s art) and their “powers” or mechanics are pretty interesting. The problem with this game is that is has all the randomness of a true dice game like Yahtzee. Your dice rolls completely control what happens. By logic, my husband should have won. He had the best cards in multiples, he had strategy, but I had better dice rolls. So by complete luck of the dice rolls, I won.

For me, almost any game with dice rolling will do. This one has a good dice roll mechanic in a not so long time frame. One of wife's favorite game.

I enjoy the base game quite a bit. It's fun to be able to gain money through multiple means, even while it's not your turn. The replay value is not fantastic with the base game, as what's available is always the same. It's a very fun, light-hearted card/engine building game.

2016-03-13 - 4 - The game works, but the first part is very boring and the second suffers from huge snowball effect. I played with Harbor expansion, which is included into the base game in Poland. At least the game is quite quick.

RATING: 8.5
A quick game of buying cards to build up your town to then earn more money to buy more cards.  The catch is that your engine of town cards only fruit money if you roll certain numbers on dice.  Therefore, there is some luck, but also a strategy as to how you want to focus your purchases.  Do you spread it out, so that most any roll will give you something, or do you focus a lot on certain cards, so that certain numbers will REALLY pay off?  Also, some cards will allow you to steal from an opponent if they roll a certain number on their turn, and other cards will give you money if anyone rolls that number... even outside of your turn.  Other cards give you new powers and eventually give you a win if you build the four big structures for your town.  A clever and quick game.  The 10 card variant shakes things up a bit more. On its own, I give this game an 8, but with the Harbor Expansion, it jumps to an 8.5.  Just get the expansion with the base game.

I should also note that early printings of the game have slightly longer cards than those that come with the expansions.  This makes shuffling a bit annoying when they are mixed.  This happened with my copy and I reached out to IDW and they replaced my base game cards very quickly and kindly; the cards now match the size of the Harbor Expansion cards and any future expansion.

This game can become stale after repeated plays, but the dynamic is initially fun, and plays well with large groups. Easy to pick up. Rules are straight-forward. Various age groups may be accommodated. 
Still maintains game play with only 2 (although diminished).

This game is a bit of a disappointment.  The artwork and simplicity of play made this a much anticipated game and it would have been an automatic buy if I hadn't had the chance to play it first.  The game is susceptible to huge randomness and luck of the dice where one player can absolutely dominate by constantly getting money from the other players leaving these other players unable to accumulate any money to buy useful cards.  Such a game is frustrating and ZERO fun for the victim giving the impression that the game is broken.  Fortunately however, this is not the normal situation and given the relatively short play time, such a game would be soon over.  Usually the games are more balanced but still, the winner will likely be the one who throws his optimal die roll once or twice before anyone else.  It’s a fun and relatively fast playing game which I’ll gladly play again but probably wouldn't suggest it and don't need to own it.  Also, getting an expansion to fix the problems of the base game makes no sense.

This is a horrible non-game and 99% pure luck. You can save a lot of time by just rolling a die and the player with the highest roll wins.

No decisions in the game matter at all. It doesn't matter if you diversify or specialize. It doesn't matter if you buy sensibly or randomly. 

Only the luck of the die roll decides the winner. 

Absolutely worthless game and a waste of time and space!

Played once with five players and the Harbour expansion. Seemed like far too much luck, barely any catch-up, and missing turn after turn for being unlucky while opponents gain income off your rolls was utterly disheartening. Catan gets away with it because it has trading, but this just seemed like a rich-get-richer race to the top.

So disappointed by the games expansions as they completely break the game (I rated them both a '1' along with the Deluxe Edition.  The base game is really all you should ever play.  Even then it becomes very stale and repetitive quickly due to it having very limited strategies.  As random as it is its made only worse by the added randomness of the marketplace in ANY expansion.  Still you will often either have a runaway leader or winning will be determined by who rolls the number they needed first.  I love many games with dice and don't mind randomness at all.  But there is little satisfying about this game play experience once you realize the game is mostly just playing you.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Machi Koro:[/b][/size]
- The game lacks meaningful decisions because there is no way to mitigate bad dice rolls. You also have no control over who your die rolls benefit. I consider this a flaw of the game.  
- The game drags on because the winner of the game is obvious early in the game.

Nice light filler/fluff game that takes Catan-esque dice rolls to generate money and puts some city-building theme to it. Best part of the game is honestly the artwork.

High marks for accessibility but not that much to offer in replay value. Our first games had someone hitting the obvious Cheese Factory strategy and everyone chased him for 3 games. Not a great impression for some.

This game was WAY overhyped. Three major complaints:
1. It's all about luck. If you don't roll well, you get nothing.
2. NOT a city-building game. This is a dice-rolling, coin-collecting game whose goal is to buy four cards.
3. Red & purple cards steal coins from other players. When you only get coins due to chance/luck, it's a terrible system.
Machi Koro is ONLY for gamers who enjoy gambling!

RATING: 7.6
excellent filler. one of the best games i have played despite that it is pretty light. sometimes dice rolls cqn be off and when that happens well it isnt a nine than. luck of the roll will determine outcome. we had a game were three players were rolling for the victory.
despite that building your income engine and watching yours and others work is a joy. 
because of the luck i cant rate it a nine. but i cant see me tiring quixckly of this game. meaning i will have to sleeve this.

Played this a lot more than my three logged plays would suggest.
It is a bad idea to play with all cards of the expansion at once. Everybody is free to do what they want and setup combos.  You should draft the cards as it says in the rules.

Played vanilla with two and with two this is a four.

It's a 7 with three
a8.5 with four
and back to a 6.75 with five

Dice-rolling and tableau building. Buildings are triggered by the dice result, sometimes by other player's dice as well. Highly luck-driven, but there is a room for strategic planning. Indeed, rolling two dice is qualitatively different from rolling just one. Buildings with numbers 6, 7, and 8 seem to be crucial to win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on his own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than his rivals. On his turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, he gets the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of his city on future turns. The first player to construct all of his landmarks first wins!

A deck building game that is packed full micro choices.  The caveat to these choices, that potentially prevents you from steam rolling everyone, is a dice mechanic that keeps the game light hearted and zesty.

I have played this 3 times so far, and I can see how there is definitely a way to bring strategy into this quick dice game. The key is to monopolize high probability buildings (like catan). Can this game be figured out? Maybe at some point, but so far I haven't found it, and until then, I enjoy it.

This becomes less interesting/fun after several plays and people continue to take time to consider card purchases, etc...just not enough game to keep my attention. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Fun, light filler that plays a little like Settlers except you start with rolling only die and likely will move to two dice making early game buildings less productive.  Nasty cards exist which allows theft of money and buildings.  First to build the four gray buildings wins!

I loved this when it came out and I played it nearly 30 times. Then I bought the Harbor expansion which killed the game completely for us. The 10 card stacks rule did notvwork at all had to be house ruled with the now official 5/5/2 variant. But the expansion made the game too long. Around that time I bought Splendor and that game did everything Machi Koro did but better. I still like to play this and a lot of friends own copies. But I sold it in 06/2017

[u]Comments:[/u]
From the first moment I saw an image of the Machi Koro box I knew I had fallen in love. The illustrations for this game are absolutely perfect, and the other graphic design choices just follow from those. I was lucky enough to have a friend win this in tournament at GenCon 2014 which gave me a choice to play the game a few times at the convention. At first I struggled with the dice rolling, and I started to wonder if I had made a mistake pre-ordering the game from my FLGS, but then I remembered it was a silly dice rolling game that and I should just enjoy it for what it is. After I told myself that the game really kicked into high gear and I started seeing how awesomely simple and fun Machi Koro is. I am so glad I ordered this and I can't wait to get my copy in so I can play the crap out of it. Its extremely simple to teach and so tense when playing. You pray for that big role to come up that will feed your need for buildings those wonders. When you finally do get a big roll you always feel like shouting and carrying on like a madman, and feeling like you are the smartest person in the world (which you aren't, just fyi, but that doesn't stop you from FEELING that way). I can't think of another game that is more up my alley than Machi Koro. Okay maybe if there was some shooting of lasers or negotiations it would be even more up my alley, but for what it is, it is simply awesome. Japan must be, much like Poland about five years ago, game design Valhalla.

It's OK, but you just don't have enough control. If you roll badly early on and/or get stung with the red cards you can be out of the running for the rest of the game.
The Tuna Boat seems a bit overpowered. That said, it's quite pretty and is inoffensive. Rubbish without the Harbour though.

This is a game I want to enjoy more and maybe I will with a higher player count. But, as it stands, I do not particularly like it with just 2 players. Shut and Sit Down's review of this game had me excited for this as a 2-player game, but it didn't hold up very well. I may update my thoughts after some 3/4-player rounds with the game.

A game I was really excited to try because of the theme and similarities I saw to Catan. After playing it, the game feels like the player who implements the 1 winning strategy first will always be the winner. Feels like an expansion is really needed for this game.

A fast and easy little card game whose cuteness hides the potential for some screwage. It's going to be a pretty big hit, but I kind of wish there was a little bit more in the base set, as the paths seem limited. An expansion is planned, but I think a better way to go would have been to have more cards in the set and only use some of them each game, Dominion-style.

A fun, easy to learn and play card game where you buy various types of buildings/establishments in a city.  Each card has a number at the top which corresponds to the roll of a die or dice.  If you roll that number on a card, then that effect takes place.  I did notice that if you focus on buying certain cards (like the Cafe), you can gain an advantage early on (anytime anyone else rolls a '3', you get a coin).  The goal is to be the first to build your four landmarks first.

I really enjoy this game, so long as I use a house rule.  The house rule is fairly straightforward; we just play with the rules for piles that's in the expansion, except for we play with 8 piles instead of 10.  There simply aren't enough different cards in the base game to do 10 piles.

To expound: instead of starting the game with a stack of each type of card, all the cards are shuffled together in one giant stack.  Then, take cards from the top.  Every time you take a new type of card (the first Ranch, for instance), place it in a new pile.  Every time you take a card that already has a pile, just place it on that pile (the second ranch, the third ranch, etc.).  Continue until you have eight piles, then stop.

Throughout the game, whenever a pile is depleted, start drawing from the big stack again, following the same procedure.  So there's always ten piles of different cards.

If you've played the game a few times, you'll find there's basically four strategies (cheese factory, shopping mall, fruit & veggie market, and furniture factory), and because all the cards are available to be bought, there's no reason to not simply do one strategy and nothing else (barring someone else trying to do the same strategy, and depleting a necessary pile).  Once other people have started to figure out the game, it gets even less fun.

BUT, if you play with this variant, you don't have any of those troubles.  First, it's not usually possible to do strictly one strategy, because after you buy the cards available, they usually run out.  So you have to blend strategies.  Also, you don't know which cards are going to come out, so you have to weigh your risks.  You start thinking about how well a card will perform on its own if you never get the other card that combos with it.

Now granted, this variant means that there's a lot of randomness to what things are available.  Some games have a lot more red cards so there's a lot more stealing.  Some games take a while to get going if most of the piles are high numbers that no one can roll yet.  

But regardless, I still find this way much funner because a) every game has a different setup and you have to develop different strategies to deal with it, and b) the landscape of possibilities actually changes as you go through the game, opening and closing doors of opportunity.

Is it still a game of chance?  Yes.  But now there's a lot more variety instead of monotony.

Machi Koro is a short dice-rolling light strategy game.  And if you like light quick games, and you play with this variant, then you can get a lot of plays (and therefore fun) for your buck.

Oh yeah, and the components are not high quality.  They're just ok.  Especially the money cardboard uncentered tokens, bleah.

Some people have called this game Catan without the board and I can see where they're coming from, as the way to trigger getting money is the same. Too me this game is way too light and too prone to the whims of the dice. There is also quite the snowball effect since if you get lucky early you can buy more buildings to further increase your odds, although the game is short enough that it doesn't last much longer once someone is clearly going to win barring some terrible luck. Different buildings become weaker or stronger depending on the number of players. I'm not completely sure how balanced everything is, but it seems like every building would be at least situationally viable at some player count.

Ordered from Amazon Aug 2014 with in-law gift certificate, received Oct 2014.
After 3 games 2 player, I am a little underwhelmed. Even after 3 games, it feels like the arc of the game will proceed on a similar course each time. I guess that is OK if that is all you expect from it, but I was expecting a bit more from it, given the BGG hype. 3rd game we limited the number of buildings to 4 per pile, which improved the play but still, it feels like there are things you will do every game and a bit of variation in the dice and which order you buy things won't make much difference. Would like to try with 3 or 4 players though. Update: we did try it with 4 and it was not a hit with anyone really. Don't really get the excitement for this game - on the trade pile.

The thrill of gambling with cute little pictures! It's a crowd pleaser and I can't argue with the amount of fun it delivers in such a short time. It doesn't feel like a city building game. It feels like roulette. What handicaps it is the fact that even good players can have "nothing" turns because the amount of chance involved. This balance of lucky and unlucky rolls is what makes it a good starter/family/young kids game since it's just as likely a younger player will beat an older more experienced one in a given game.

It's really the dilution of Settlers of Catan into what the latter game REALLY is, but streamlined, substituting card drafting for area control, and better because of it (and I feel more honest of a representation of the game having no balance designed in whatsoever outside of the external factors of players feeling sorry for the disadvantaged players and ganging up on the advantaged/ahead ones).
  Roll dice to see how much money you get (like resources), build a tableau of cards that then get you more money for those rolls (like building towns/cities), keep going.  Simple family game, but doesn't have that initial two choices in the very beginning of Catan that determines one's build rate for the entire game, but rather everyone at least STARTING evenly with the same two buildings.

Will really try and sell Pop on this, saying it's just like LCR (but with actual decisions) and just as easy, and will leave it with the family who will hopefully play it a lot.
-- Failed. Just can't get the parents to play games. Sadface.

Traded away at Origins'16 Math Trade to hopefully someone that can give it more love.

One of the few games I played where you can literally have many rounds where you don't get to play, especially at the beginning, all it takes is having the wrong resources and the wrong die roll.  Nice components, and easy to teach, but that is not enough for me to want to play it again.  I prefer games where everyone feels involved all the time and where there is greater interaction among players.  At least it's quick!

Only played once with Harbor expansion. Idiotic dice game with wild swings of luck. Prone to hate drafting the player clockwise from you into perpetual poverty. Several broken cards like Tax Office and Publisher. No amount of good play can offset someone who rolls well late. Took almost two hours to play so unless our game was an anomaly, the game with expansion total garbage...

UPDATE: Apparently they didn't test expansion because many people complained about the above issue. They have fixed it in latest versions so I significantly raised rating. My first play was a perfect storm of unfortunate luck that made our group hate the game unjustly.

Way too luck based, plus a very obvious winning strategy - and WAY TOO MANY mean cards - makes this a very frustrating game at the two player count which is what I generally play.  This may have been rectified somewhat by the expansion - but the expansion cards are of different sizes (and quality) which makes the process of shuffling nearly impossible and very frustrating.  Plus there seem to be even more mean cards in the expansion.  Very unfortunate, because I feel this game has such potential.  Update:  quite enjoyable at the three player count!

What can I say, this game just "feels" good. You build your own little world, its quick, you'll want to play again, and gimme those queen coins! Or King coins! Either way, its just really rewarding (even if you don't win). The art is "cute", but also cool looking. I love Japanese stuff. The box is a little bigger than I expected (but not big by any means). Comes with room for the expansion(s). Looking forward to picking that expansion up! Just keep track of all of your cards and what they do. Your first game may have some hiccups. Red takes coins only from people who rolled that number, blue takes from the bank regardless of who rolls, purple takes from everybody BUT you if you roll. Green gives just you money when you roll that number. We were treating red cards as purple and by the time we noticed the game was almost over. Pick it up!

Machi Koro blends strategy and luck in the right way. Every time you establish a new building in your town, you're selecting your strategy. Then if you get lucky on a die roll (not necessarily your own), your strategy pays off. But your choices are not black-and-white, all-or-nothing. You get to build a different building each round, which lets your fine-tune your strategy.
The game is over quickly. I wish it lasted a bit longer.

I did not enjoy my first game of this, even though I won in the end. In the beginning my dice rolls were appalling and I couldn't tell if it was that or bad decisions on cards that were making me lag behind my opponent - it felt like Catan all over again! Equally, when I then won, it felt like it was more due to a couple of very fortuitous rolls on my part than any real skill. However, I do like resource building games, so given its reputation I would play a few more times before I wrote it off altogether.

I wasn't sure if MK would be too light for me, but I was optimistic that it would work out -- and it did! This is a cute, fun little game with lots of charm and a solid amount of strategy, tactics, and interesting choices for its play length. It's also easy to teach and fun to look at.

MK reminds me of Dominion and, for some reason, Settlers. Both good things! Its balance of luck, strategy, and small footprint should keep it in the mix for some time to come. It would easily pack down to a deckbox and a small baggie for travel, too.

At age 7, my daughter asked to play this. She had fun with it, and asked to play it again. Her strategies aren't the best, but she's getting better -- and she has fun playing it, which is the important part.

Felt like they hadn't play-tested this at all. The cards were incredibly unbalanced. The cheapest buildings are the best. Why would you ever buy the expensive ones? Or more importantly: Why would you ever switch to 2 dice, when it's much more profitable (and safe) to keep using 1 the entire game? The premise of the game is really good, but the execution is just horrible. Would love if someone could do this right, as it is a really nice idea.

This is a fun game. It is easy to teach and looks user friendly. The art is colourful and quirky. People enjoy it and it does remind me of Catan's gameplay in a way. It can be taken with on a trip as it is just cards, you just need enough table space. Easy, relatively quick and interesting.

RATING: 8.5
I like it. I like it quite a bit, actually. There are certainly some familiar elements. Machi Koro feels like a blend of Dominion (communal card decks that are purchased and combined to create synergy), Atlantis Rising (building specific card-based buildings to win the game), and a bunch of other familiar dice-based games. This familiarity is not a negative, as I quite enjoy how all of these things come together to make a quality game. The dice also make the end-game exciting. You can have all the money you need to build and win on your next turn, but if someone rolls a certain number on theirs, they can steal the win away from your. FUN!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Love the cute artwork on this game. It's a good balance between the strategy of how to tune your engine building mechanic, versus the luck of the dice roll. And as such, this game has a little bit for every kind of gamer. And this might sound weird but it's probaby a Catan killer for me.

RATING: 4
Underwhelming to say the least. Its popularity befuddles me as I see nothing here that warrants replay. Even the guy who owns it and was teaching it to people openly admitted how lacking the base game was.

Expansion makes it slightly more interesting but adds unwanted playtime to what should be a quick filler game. Still seems incredibly unbalanced even then. I might rate it a 5 with the expansion, but that's it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Fun light, dice-driven card game of starting with a couple of building cards and rolling one, then potentially two dice to activate the buildings you've built (which grant money for you from the bank and other players). Some buildings earn you points on other players turns when they roll specific numbers or provide multipliers when rolled in conjunction with other owned cards.

Might feel really same-y after a few plays but great for that wind down time at a con when it's 2am and you just don't want to go to bed yet! :-)

Played three times. The game is way too random, destructive and long, especially with the expansions. In our third game, player A rolled a 5, which gave him nothing but player C (me) got 2 coins from Forests and took his 5 coins with French Resturant. Then player B rolled and took 7 coins from player C (me). That was not a fun turn for anyone except player B, who also finally won the game. I wanted to like this, I like cards with buildings, but I rate this a 3.

I was struggling to decide between a 6 and 7. Once you and the people you are playing with have learnt the patterns there are essentially two routes which will increase your chances of winning and everyone will just follow them. So if you start well you can be set up for vicoty. However sometime the dice have something different to say and who wins can be entirely random. It's quick and quite fun rolling the dice so the fact it's a bit random isn't too much of a problem.

RATING: 5
Machi Koro is a very light civilization building game.  Players start with a couple cards that represent the basic building blocks of their society.  Several piles of other cards are placed in the middle of the table which can be purchased by the players.  Every card represents a building, or place, that can be added to your society.  All these cards have a special power, usually involving getting money either from the bank, or other players.  There are still other cards - four of them per player- that they must buy to win the game.

I found there to be a few problems with Machi Koro.  First of all, turns are incredibly repetitive.  On your turn you roll one, or two dice, and take the actions that correspond to your roll, if any.  Then you buy a card if you want, and are able.  That constitutes your entire turn...every turn.  Secondly, because everything you might be able to do is dependent on a die roll the game is very luck-based.  Lastly, it looks like there's a real possibility of a runaway leader problem.

I can't recommend this game when there are so many other great games out there.  Don't waste your time on this one.

Cool tableau-building game, bit like Catan without trading. Let's be honest though, trading is best thing about Catan.. Why does this work? Well, it's faster, has better artwork and there are interactive cards that let you steal coins from others. With expansion the replayability is good (at that point you've paid big box price though), otherwise bit disappointing.

Must play with the variant in which all cards are shuffled and dealt until 8 types (or 10, if using the expansion) are revealed. This saves the game.

Now that I've played with both expansions mixed in, the game is much better. The base game without the variant is a 5 at best. Using both expansions with random stacks of cards brings it to a 7.

A nice group game that keeps everyone engaged. There is some strategy, but high dice randomness keeps the game from being more than light fun. Has a definite slot machine feeling of rolling the dice over and over and hoping that a jackpot will come up based on the cards you've invested in. Does not play as well with fewer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very neat, simple core mechanism of rolling dice and buying cards to optimize income. Similar to Settlers in regard to income based on dice rolls, but offers some interesting decisions in regard to card combos, as well as different amount and possible frequency of payouts.  The game plays quickly, which makes it very approachable but also seems to prevent pursuing some deeper strategies.  Most games seem to come down to someone getting a good card combo early followed by a few lucky rolls.  Still, a unique and fun little card game if you're okay with the higher degree of randomness you would expect from a dice-centric game.

I know a lot of players really like this, but it plays as a combination of Settlers of Catan with deck building elements.

In this game you are building up a tableau of buildings that can be activated either on your turn only, your opponent turns only, or on any player's turn. To activate the buildings dice must be rolled to the sum of the building in question.

The goal is to earn money in order to build each of your special buildings, which both will grant you new abilities, but also take you one step further towards winning the game, as the player who can build all of their special buildings will ultimately win the game.

It's an enjoyable game, but I have to say I much prefer Valeria: Card Kingom, which has a lot of similarities, but expands more on the idea. This is the tighter game, the more cut throat game, and you can really get screwed over by the dice rolls, either by triggering opponents ability to steal from you with their red cards, or by opponents grabbing all the blue cards before you have a chance, making their turns essentially useless for you. And I personally just prefer the smorgasboard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Easy game to learn.

Balance evolves with numbers of players since some cards have effects during all rounds, some don't.

But replayability is not so good and luck is too strong in the game. When a player takes the advantage, he often keeps it and increases it.

This is a good gateway game.  It works for gamers, but there are issues.

I play with the Harbour Expansion and use a modified setup.  This helps the randomness, but there are still issues when the right cards pop up for the right people at the right time.

Still, the game plays quickly, and keeps everyone engaged.  You could do a lot worse.

RATING: 3
Well, it's better than Dominion. Which as far as praise goes is like saying being peed on is better than being pooped on.

Oh, how the tension and excitement build as you roll a die or two, pick a card and put it in your tableau, or whatever they call it here. Probably tableau because that's a nice-sounding word that makes it seem like something elegant is going on.

And then you hope that the random numbers other people roll will be the numbers you need! Whee!

I'm not even convinced that it's actually a game. I mean, sure, it's technically a game in that it has rules and you compete against other players to win. But there isn't really a strategy (you can specialize or diversify, but either way you just hope to get lucky.) And trying not to doze off isn't really a skill.

The best thing about it is that it's short. That's all I've got, sorry.

Love this game... played it 3 times with family around Christmas, and everyone had a blast.

As others have noted, this feels like a descendant of Settlers of Catan.  It scratches the same gaming itch - it is a family-weight, short length, dice driven game (heavily luck dependent).

It really lends itself to quick, somewhat strategic decisions, humerous "take that" moments, and a desire by the players to immediately play again and so that they can try a different approach.

RATING: 5
Great fun game with very simple city-building mechanics. I like to call this game the Modern, stream-lined version of Monopoly. It has similar concepts (dice rolling on your turn, building stuff you or your opponents get "hit" on when you roll the right roll of the dice, and making enough money to eventually win the game. It also has the same "pull away" swing factor for someone who gets money, tends to make even more money and thus win the game (normal for many Eurogames as well). 

Newbies can easily pick the game up in a few turns, and figure out good strategies after just one game. The base set is a little lacking though and I wouldn't recommend this game without the Harbor Expansion.  It's far too simplistic without it. With the Harbor Expansion, rating goes up.

Exceeded (low) expectations. I've only played with the Plus/Harbor expansion, but quite fun 2p. Roll a die (or two), collect some coins. It's the divergent engines built with purchasing different cards from the tableau that makes it compelling. Only one play but I enjoyed it. I'll definitely pick this one up.

Only the base game. 

It's really swingy, it looks pretty and that's about it. It's pretty simple, has little downtime and introduces themes and actions that more complex games use, so as a gateway, it could work pretty well.

Not my favorite, but I don't hate it either.

In Machi Koro, players roll dice, and if they have a card that corresponds to the number shown on the dice, they get that card's effect. (More often than not, it's a few coins.) They can then use their coins to buy more cards, which let them get even more coins!

Machi Koro has a cute theme, and it's very easy to get into.

On the fence. A simplified Catan style card buying game, with a healthy dose of luck and which may probably already have a correct 'answer' to the best play (one die, convenience stores etc).  It is accessible, but will need to play again to see if it works as a family game. Will try the 10 card variant. And will probably end up with the expansion also.

I was really looking forward to this game but after our first plays it seemed like there is an obvious strategy to go for with the cheese factory and the cattle stock. We only played it with 2 players though so maybe this is less easy to accomplish with more players. I also read about a 10-card setup game, need to check this out, but for now not all of my hopes have been fulfilled.

Update: the more I play this one, the less I like it - I already added the harbour expansion to make it more interesting but then with the variable setup it makes it even worse, lenghtening the game and adding more luck to an already have-luck based game

Well, the expansion makes the game a little better but I have revised my rating of the game... this isn't very fun to play... the game suffers from a very serious runaway leader problem... once someone manages to get some money and gets on the lead it's almost impossible to stop them... the rich get richer and hammer the poor to the ground...

This allied to the complete luck of the draw of cards and the luck of the roll of the dice that can't be mitigate ruins the game for me... don't invite me to play this again...

I have only played Machi Koro once, at a local games meet-up but I rather enjoyed the game. It’s a good fun game where each player attempts to develop their town by building infrastructure (represented as card in a player’s tableau) to allow them to purchase the landmark buildings that win the game; the first player to build all the landmark buildings immediately wins the game. 

Cards are activated when their number is rolled, even if it’s not that players turn so there is the challenge for players whether to not to spread their options so they get a little something with most rolls or just to go for a ’big win’ when their lucky number comes up. Throw in cards that attack other players (usually taking either a small amount of money from everyone or a larger amount from one player) or can backfire and cause the player who holds them to lose money and there is a fair bit of fluidity to the game.

This game is well worth considering and I hear good things about the expansion.

UPDATE:

Played more games at Cancon and purchased. This one is a keeper.

Not the game for me.  I was "meh" on it 2.5 years ago when I think we either played the base game, or with one expansion.  

Played today with multiple expansions mixed in and giant deck with random (constantly changing) 10-card tableau, and it was just painful, random and not fun at all.  It isn't about winning or losing, it's about at least getting to play the game?  

Maybe there are ways to configure it where it would be more fun (ensuring that there are actually low-number cards to buy at the beginning, and not all purple/red cards, etc?), but I think I will just refuse to play it again.  Too many actual fun games out there -- why torture myself with this one?

This is a card and dice game. You purchase cards which have a number on the top and activate when that number is rolled on the dice. Some cards only the person rolling can activate, others when someone else activates. The cards can stack to increase their activated power. There is a lot of interaction as you can buy cards that “attack” other players.
This game improves a lot when coupled with the Harbour expansion.

Machi Koro will always create fond memories for me, being one of the games that got me back into the hobby. However, there is no denying that as time has gone on I have wanted more from my games than Machi Koro delivers, and while the game has undoubtably been improved by expansions the added length further distances me from the game. Dice City almost pushed it out of my collection but Valeria Card Kingdoms was the final nail in the coffin. Good bye old friend.

RATING: 7
Machi Koro really feels like a stripped-back Settlers of Catan in card form. This is in relation to how players gain coins each turn based on the activation number of each of their town additions (cards). 

There is some room for interesting play but when all player's are relatively matched in experience and 'gaming smarts' then the dice are going to decide the outcome in most cases. 

I can see why this one was so well received in 2014 but I also think that has a lot to do with the broadening of the hobby-base. This would not have attracted much more than a sniff of interest back in the early to mid 2000s. 

That is not a snobbish comment as I enjoy the game enough but without expansions I wouldn't want to be playing it more than 3-4 times a month otherwise it would begin to outstay its welcome. 

Good stuff for families though, the time-poor and the gateway crowd.

[edit: Yep, dropped to a 6]

I suspect that the rating of this game will drop to a 6, but for the time being it is a very pleasant game.  Easy to teach.  A vague sense that your accumulated tableau acquires a personality -- "My town is all about the mall.  My town is cranking out furniture."  This personality combined with the luck of the dice, provides a vague sense of narrative, as well.  Yes, luck is going to be the primary determinant on who wins.  If you played this game with someone who is hyper competitive, you are in for a miserable play experience.  As a family game, it's nice.

Finally, normally I don't particularly care for games with "card-conditionalities."  Keeping track of when this card does what based on these other cards.  What's nice is that Machi Kora has this, but only to a very, very modest degree.  Further, the conditionalities are thematically supported.  The furniture factory and forests go together.  The cheese factory and the dairies go together.  Etc.

During their turn, players roll 1 or two dice. They then use coins to purchase buildings. Some buildings allow you to get coins during your turn, some earn coins during other people's turns, or some allow you to take coins from other people. The first player to build all 4 landmarks wins the game. 

This game has been compared to a lighter version of Settlers of Catan. It's a fun filler, and you can choose what strategy to pursue. You do need some luck for your buildings to come up. Some people think there is too much luck. I'm certainly looking forward to more plays of this.

Machi Koro epitomizes the use of dice I despise in games: Plan first, then roll to see if you succeed. A good roll and things work, a bad roll and you've wasted a turn.

Granted Machi Koro's purchases allow a player to try and mitigate bad dice rolls by improving the odds of success, but its still a chance game. If you consistently roll poorly, which is a statistical possibility, all the planning in the world won't save you.

The more I played, the more I began to realize I should have taken Machi Koro's childish art design as a clue to how simplistic and bereft of depth the game would prove to be.

I was not a fan of this one.  Not only was it pretty random, but when it's your turn...it's boring.  You get a bad roll, there isn't really much to do but wait until next turn, or hope your opponents roll the correct numbers to give you stuff.

Frankly, I'd rather play Catan...and I'm not a big fan of that one either.

This is a nice light game and anyone playing it should be prepared for how light and random it is. While the Harbor Expansion makes it a better game, imo, it also makes it even more random. Not only will the dice be random, but the cards will also be random with the expansion.

So it's a game where you either thank or curse the dice gods and enjoy the ride. If you are expecting strategy, you'll probably be disappointed.

Fun and quick engine building game with dice randomness. These kind of mini-engine building games seem to be coming into vogue these days (e.g. Splendor), which I quite like. The dice add some randomness but there is enough control to make it enjoyable.

I do wonder about replayability; there seems to be a fair (though perhaps not huge) variety of strategies but little variation within a strategy. I'd have to play more to tell, though.

I might be a bit biased because I won my first and only two plays with what turned out, quite accidentally, to be ideal counter-strategies in hindsight.

RATING: 7.35
I had been following this game for a long time. I was planning to do a print and play version, until I heard was going to publish it in Spanish. Then I decided to wait... and they have just published it, and we got to try it :-)

The rules are super-easy to learn. It's everything in each card, but even if the cards have text, you don't need time to understand then, etc. The setup is also fast. Even if you're a noob, in 5 minutes you can be playing.

It is a fun dice luck filler with a speedy gameflow; even if the luck is definitly the factor, you can make nice combos and do some strategy with the buildings you choose. Then it can work or not, depending your luck with the dice.

The game will finish fast enough for you not to annoy if Lady Luck does not smile upon you.

I'm quite geeky with dice games and I was worried the cards could not be balanced (in fact, they can't be balanced since some of them work on your rivals turn, and they will be more or less useful depending on the number of players). Also, there are some cards better than others, but everything is quite balanced.

Maybe its replayability will suffer on the long run, because even if there is no small number of different cards, their count is not very high either.

Overall, a very fun dice filler :-)

PS: I was also concerned about the snowball effect: for the moment, I didn't see any worth mentioning.

Money falling from the sky Catan-style, distilled to the bare minimum. No way of catching up, so this has to be played fast to be worth the time spent.

Might not have that much replayability without randomizing the card market but  that can be easily done, especially with the expansions. Also, the rulebook in the Kosmos edition already includes a variant for randomization. 

Very simple and instantly recognizable card effects, so buying the tiny Kosmos edition is not a problem at all. In addition to being in a very conveniently sized box, the Kosmos edition is printed in Germany and also has an extra icon telling whether a card works on everyone's turn or your turn only, so even the need to memorize the card color has been removed. 

Still, I find it a bit silly to have any text on the cards at all, since the effects could be very easily communicated through simple and large enough icons, making the cards even more easily recognizable from the other side of the table. Of course, the expansion cards might have too complex effects for this to work.

With the Harbour expansion, this is a 9+.  You ideally should use the 5x5x2 card set up variant rules suggested by the BGG posters.

This has replaced Ticket to Ride as our Number 1 gateway game and is going down extremely well with casual gamers, friends/family etc.  Some more serious gamers have not liked the randomness of the dice rolls but it gives everyone at the table a chance of winning which is okay with me.  It also has just the right level of interaction/take that - plus I love the city building theme.

We've not found it to be too long or unbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This city building game provides for a light and enjoyable 20 minute game. On the weekend we opened it, Machi Koro effortlessly took the top spot and was played at least a dozen times a day with different players rotating in and out!

Players take turns throwing a die, collecting money from the buildings they have, sometimes collecting money on other players turns (blue cards) and then buying one new building on that turn. The goal of the game is to flip over and construct the Train Station, Shopping Mall, Amusement Park, and the Radio Tower.

This is a fast game and easily understood. I have played it with the whole family from a six year old to sixty year old. It’s one of those games where most players are able to look at what they accomplished at the end of the game and be happy even if they didn’t win. Then they want to play again.

Each player only starts with a wheat field and a bakery. Players throw one die and the result may give them more income on their turn or on other players turns. You then buy new cards that will expand when and how you get money. You will even be able to steal from other players. Eventually, you can throw two dice and access the more generous and powerful cards that activate above 6.

This game does have some runaway mechanics in it that rely on luck, especially in a 2 player game. Once a player builds multiples of one card or gets certain powers, they are much more likely to compound that benefit for a victory. This is countered in games with more players by the fact that there are only so many of each card and that the purple and red cards allow others to steal from the player that is furthest ahead without making it a Catan-like highway of frustration for the leading player.

[i]Wow, I really dislike this game. Yes it is supposed to be a light filler but there is too much downtime between turns. Maybe it was the people I played with, but this game dragged. It is also extremely luck dependent and while I don't mind that in a quick filler like Qwixx, Machi Koro is long and in my opinion quite boring.

I agree with those who say it's a simple filler and those expecting it to be some kind of deep strategy game are not evaluating the game on its merits. However, to play it with non-gamers or as a simple, pleasant filler or warm-up game, it fills those niches. 

The rules are underwritten in that aspects of various rules aren't fully explained. Although the rule book is short, it could have used less artwork and a smaller, tighter font, with fuller text and more examples of play. This is evidenced by the extensive listing of rules questions on BGG, despite the game's relative simplicity. Once I wrote out my own version the game wasn't hard to understand. 

Purchased February 2015. Subsequently purchased the Harbor Expansion after reading many comments about how it improves the basic design. Would like to get non-gamers or light-game gamers into this one to see how well they like it, as well as to gauge how it plays with several people.

Simple concept but well executed. I've only played the base set with the expansion drafting rules (10 available card types at any one point). Buy cards into your tableau, roll dice hoping to activate your cards Roma-style. Each card type has a different way to earn money, be it you only, on anyone's turn, steal from other players, etc. So there's choices on whether to spread across the numbers or invest in a few numbers and aim for jackpot turns. There's combos you can shoot for. Every turn buy another card to add to your tableau (or save up for a better turn, but risk losing your money to other players in the meantime), so turns become more consistent and "bigger" as the game goes on. All good stuff. Turns are fast, there's plenty of cheer factor in the die rolling, and you can always blame the dice when you lose. Which will probably be true anyway, but it doesn't pretend to be anything but a meaty filler anyway. Happy to play.

"Money Engine - The Card Game".

A Blast ! Very Cute Art !  City building card game with no hand management. Easy to learn, play, and teach. I love how all the information is open, and all buildings are available (until they're gone). Fun as 2-player, but better with more. My gaming wife kicks my butt at this one.

Potentially contains the same dice mechanism (and thus downtime) as Catan, except you may roll a single die if players choose to on their turns. However, games do move along well enough.

Though I love this vanilla, I think the expansion makes it better.

It's OK. I'd play it again if you forced my hand, but it takes too long to setup, takes up too much table space, and it's just really not that interesting.

I don't understand the hype around this game. Played it twice and gave it away. Maybe with the expansions (never even got to those because my GF hated this game so much; she gives it a zero) it's better and worth a look.

SOLD March 2015

I found the base game to be repetitive and vulnerable to one optimal strategy (rolling just one die the entire time using 1-6 buildings).  My hope for the expansion was that it would add more options, but it instead added many more options for stealing money from other players.  This lengthened the game and made it much more take-that to the extent that my kids would never play with the expansion.  They still like the base game, but I was bored with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's fun, fast and light. It's been a great success with some of my family, include my young nieces. It's cute and it works well for what it is. But ultimately, it's been a disappointment. It's too light to hold my interest and really there aren't that many options for you to go for and everybody is doing basically the same thing. Also,  it really doesn't work as well for two players - it makes green cards much stronger and red cards weaker and it limits even further the options the game provides.

The whole point of a good gateway game is that your family can enjoy it casually while you, the gamer, can enjoy the strategizing that's mitigated by the dice. Machi Koro succeeds in the first and fails in the second, as it really doesn't give you much to play with in terms of strategy.

I'm looking forward to trying it with the expansion, which I heard fixes some of these issues and will make it into a game that I can enjoy while playing with people who are more casual. However, any game that _requires_ the expansion for you to have fun with it - is flawed in my book. This is a shame, because it really is a cute and attractive theme that's well produced. 

Also, the money tokens are pretty bad and the box is really huge for no good reason. True, there might be lots of expansions but even with the one that'll be shortly out, this box would be much too big. I would have preferred to have the bigger box come with one of the later expansions.

Based on one play: My first play was with many expansions and I found the game to drag a lot and thee was many times where no one wanted any cards so everyone was just rolling and hoping for a specific number. I hear that the base game is more structured and less random. As you collect cards, you get money from rolling certain numbers or when others do so, this lets you get better and better cards till you can trigger the end game. The mechanic is nice and the cards are interesting, but the expansion removes the card order so you get cards that no one can use often. Looking forward to trying the base game.

It's much faster Monopoly without a board.  Few people are willing to admit it, but that doesn't make it less true.  There are some pretty serious runaway leader issues with the game (only somewhat fixed in the expansions), and the "much faster" bit is vital to getting it to hit the table, but in the end I feel that it comes down to luck more than skill in almost every game.

I'll still play it occasionally, because it *is* fast, and there's something to be said for building your city with all of its sweet sweet hotels, er, cards, but deep Machi Koro ain't.

Machi Koro is a quick dice-based filler.  You buy cards from a Dominion-like market that tells you what you get on various die rolls--dice rolls here affect all players like Settlers of Catan.  While enjoyable, I found the game to be lacking in depth and variety.  There's only one resource (money), and the cards that you can buy are fixed, so you're presented with the same choices in each game.  Additionally, some of the cards featured take-that abilities that I didn't care for.  The system has potential if the game had a Dominion-scale assortment of cards to choose from, but as it stands, it's somewhat bland.

Played with the Harbor expansion.

The game was an interesting city building game, somewhat of a cross between Catan and Suburbia.  I liked the different building powers, the interactivity, and how the dice were implemented vs a Catan.  It was nicer than Catan as well.

There seemed to be too many card interactions on some dice rolls and got a tad clunky.

We had watched it played in a three player game, and both agreed it would be more fun and have a little more depth and dynamic to it as a 3 or 4 player game.

*Edit - got it in front of the family group and just as I expected it was an enormous hit!  They could not get enough of it and played three straight games in rapid succession after I taught them.

Aggresively "rich get richer".  Original rules make for a scripted game and expansion rules are swingy and frustrating.  Like many games from Japan could use a little more development since the core idea is pretty neat.

This game was quite delightful. It draws comparisons with Settlers of Catan, and I think the comparison is justified. The thing that soured me on Settlers was how trading dragged the game to a halt. I think this was the result of the group I played with more than anything, but nevertheless it made for negative play experiences. Machi Koro distills the random resource production and engine building of SoC down to a 20-30 minute light game. I could see pulling this out with almost any group, and I am looking forward to the US release.

Good game. Light, fun, fast, but with enough reward for forethought when purchasing buildings. I bring this to almost every game meetup that I attend. However, there are some glaring flaws that make this only good instead of great. The game has a huge footprint on the table. Also, the game's luck is such where a new player can get super hosed on his first game and never want to play again. Other little niggles bring down a game that should be 8 or higher.

I had this game on my wish list when I first saw it on Eric Martin's preview. Then I read the base game has limited replay-ability so I finally removed it from my wish list. It turns out that I was right in my judgement. After 3 plays I think I've had enough of the game. Dice can make or break someone's strategy and I've found out already that I am not a dice person as a mechanism for randomization in games. It's a solid game but not a keeper. I am glad I tried before I buy.

A fun, fast "deck" building game that has a cute theme and surprising depth after the first few games feel like nothing but lucky dice rolls. One of the biggest single improvements is to shuffle all the building cards into one big deck and then randomly turn over ten unique cards at a time. It's in the harbor expansion rules and makes even the base game WAY more interesting.

Just got a copy and played it once today on its Playmat. The feeling is so good. Pretty artwork, smooth flow, interesting gameplay. Will play it with all of my friends.


2014-6-9: 
I decided to buy a copy of it just after my first play on a friend's PnP DIY version. After played 4 or 5 games with friends on this PnP, they all like it and want to play again. I found there are a lot of space for this game to add new cards in its expansion. Simple rule, interesting artwork, short game time, a lot of choices, cannot think of a reason not keep a copy at home.

This game is a very strange combination of deterministic gameplay and sheer randomness. When played according to the base game rules, each player essentially follows the same path with very little strategy involved. The only difference between players is the luck of the dice. The winner tends to be the person who happens have the lucky roles needed to repeatedly steal all of their opponent's money. You win by ensuring your opponent can't really do anything on their turn. The game plays better with 3 or 4 players than with 2. Note that the game is improved somewhat by the Harbor Expansion.

Very good game, lot´s of card´s with excellent look´s, it´s a city building, rules are very easy to learn.

This version comes with the Harbor Expansion that makes it a very more solid and it´s a must have, because it completes the game adding more options and a 5th player.

RATING: N/A
A delightful game of economic competition.  I highly recommend that even if you don't own the Harbor Expansion, you play with its "marketplace" rule anyway.  I also recommend splitting the deck into properties with die value 1-6 and properties of 7-12 and dealing each of them to its own five-slot marketplace, to avoid the early game gumming up on overly expensive properties.

(Also, if your playgroup includes younger children, you should remove the Business Centers before play.  Exchanging your Wheat Field for someone's Mine or Forest is just so oppressively harsh it can rob the game of its light-hearted nature if all players can't take such a blow with aplomb.)

Ah, dice-generating-resource games… how frustrated I get with thee! However, at least you can cover your bases in MK and - apart from #5 - I managed to be getting something on almost every turn and fought off a strong challenge for the win with a 7 dice roll. A very slow start to the game (possibly because of the Harbor expansion?) didn’t help first impressions, but I preferred it to Colt Express which beat it to the SdJ. (Oddly, though, I think I like THE GAME more than both of them!)

City building, Dice fueled engine builder. "Catan-like/light" dice rolling to determine which resources (buildings) trigger; OR Monopoly-like dice rolling to trigger opponents buildings.  Varied ways to build your engine. Fairly light and quick playtime.
-Unlikely dice rolls can may play a prominent roll. Not regarded as well with only 2p, need more interactions. Some fairly cutthroat ways to approach the engine building.

This is a light game where you roll a die and then resolve the effects of cards in front of you that match that die face. As you play the game, you buy new cards, so you can diversify your numbers to get effects more often, or you can stack copies of the same card (with a few minor exceptions) and hope for the best. In our game, I diversified, bought a second die to roll (so I had cards for 1-12) and wound up 1 turn behind the other player who stuck to only numbers 1-6. It's a cute game but it has a real lack of re-playability. I wanted expansions to help that but the expansions are so poorly designed that it honestly ruined the game for me.

A clever, good looking hybrid of Settlers and Dominion.  I like the minimalist art and the simplicity of the gameplay.  Makes for a fun little filler.  Might not be the best choice for gamers who are adverse to a little screwage, but I think it adds to the experience. The randomness will likely turn off "serious" gamers, but it was fine for me too.  
Looking forward to the expansions!  

PS  Nice insert.  I appreciate that.

Machi Koro wasn't as good as I'd expected from the rave reviews. I think I'm generally not a fan of card games where all the options are set out from the start (Dominion included) - perhaps the expansion helps with this. Lots of dice luck and the interaction is rather obvious.

Simple and anticlimactic. Roll, gain money, buy a card. Pretty simple and would be a good gateway game. The part that makes it somewhat interesting is that the cards for different number/die rolls are different actions/amount of money; also that some cards effect die on on others' turn in addition to own turn.

Perhaps a dozen plays between the original and expansions; plays fairly quick, at least, and sits a decent number of players.
Falls under the category of boring for me.  Too often the decision you're making is "do I buy the one thing I can afford, or wait and hope?"  No meaningful theme.  I've been known to call it two dice Yahtzee.

The base game is a nice filler - abet a bit longish for a filler. Reminiscent of Settlers of Catan without the map. You acquire money via a die roll and the buildings you have purchased. As you collect money you buy more buildings to enhance your engine and to make enough to unlock your victory buildings. So what is missing, trading. 
It left me unenthused, definitely not on my wishlist.

July 2015: Bought this from an auction. It included Harbor w/o the expansion box. We played once at HTG and I saw it as a gateway for some of the non-gamers I'm around - fully interactive and quicker if you use less cards.

I will probably vary the goal cards to keep the same game-length. I haven't looked at any 'perscribed' variants for card reduction and if there aren't maybe I'll be early.

Oct 2015: It's just so boring without a fun group. A fun group will add 0.5 to my score. Rolling 1 die is /yawn and rolling 2depends on what everone bought.

Very cute game of trying to build target cards before everyone else, using a dice roll mechanic to trigger income. Quite a bit of luck so that when you lose you can blame the rolls of the dice. There's a few things to think about though, so when you win you can claim it was due to your brilliance.

I love the artwork of this Japanese marble. The game play is so lovely easy. A player rolls a die and then look up your cards if one of them generates you income. Some cards generate income at any person's turn, some at your turn only or a few even only when somebody else rolls.
Income is in coins and at your turn you may purchase a building. You can pick any building from the middle of the table or you may build one of the four own unfinished buildings where you started with. The first player to complete there four buildings wins Machi Koro!
Great lovely artwork, nice, easy and engaging game play. Awesome!

Settlers of Catan rage x 55. I absolutely loathe this game. Nothing interesting happens except I go mental when I can't roll a 6. Not enough to do on your turn, not enough interesting decisions. Just try to make a few (obvious) card combos and hope you roll well. At least it was quick.

Way more fun than the sum of it's parts. This game is so simple, but there is something very satisfying about the escalation in cards and money. Knowing when to bump up to multiple dice can be tough. The game is light that when other player's cards pay off while yours sit by useless, it's hard not to just laugh it off. Basically, this an excellent filler. I can't wait to add expansions.

Extremely simple game.  It's hard not to fall in love with Machi Koro on your first play.....but you may get bored relatively quickly.  Few combos are hard to ignore (buy ranches/cheese factories or buy forests/mines/furniture factories...then roll 7s and 8s).

I haven't yet tried the Harbor expansion, but hope it will add replay-ability (via multiple paths to victory).

I see this as a great gateway game for people who enjoy rolling-dice.  Less barrier to entry than Catan (and less time to complete the game), but you still feel the power of building an engine that will launch you to victory.

Whether or not you have the expansion, I would strongly recommend using the 10 cards available at any time (rather than having all the cards available) variant.

Recommended.

The box is HUGE considering what you are actually getting. No idea why it's so big. Hopefully it's for expansions.

The game itself is pretty decent. You can explain it in about 2 minutes and just start playing. Decent amount of luck, without a lot of strategy. Kind of like a Catan-lite. I like it though. I'd recommend it.

RATING: 6.8
this game is a streamlined game or card drafting with dice rolling.  At first there doesn't seem to be much with the game as it starts a little slow but interesting decisions begin to develop as you decide whether to roll one or two dice and which cards to buy.  There can be a defensive aspect to this thought process which is where the puzzle aspect begins.  Now it's probably not a game to take too seriously because you are working with probabilities with a die or two but entertains non-the -less.  Probably needs an expansion or two as you use every card in the base game each game which will get old quickly.   The Harbor expansion rectifies the clunky start and changes the set-up to create more variety.  Make this original game seem complete.

I've only played this once so far, and while I doubt it will be our last time, nor will I 100% refuse to play again, I won't ever do so willingly. I can best describe this as a card-game version of Settlers of Catan, a game I intensely dislike - it has the same dice-based randomness, and much of the same "take that". It's a bit more interesting than Catan - at least it feels that way based on 1 play of Machi Koro and many of Catan - but still not something I would ever choose to play.

Variação do Catan, é dinâmico e interessante. Um dos caminhos para a vitória parece a princípio ser o mais certo, e precisa ser bem marcado para os demais jogadores terem chance.

I enjoy this, although I think the base game is a tad predictable (I love Mines), but my partner LOVES it.  Very easy to pick up and play with new people, and offers a similar experience (in terms of mechanics) to Settlers of Catan in about half the time.  I would rate it higher, but I prefer a bit more complexity and a little less luck.  I would definitely recommend the Millionaire's Row and Harbour expansions, as these add a lot of replayability (if a little too much randomness for some tastes).

Beautiful cards and is very cute. If playing with standard rules, the experience will easily feel dull after multiple plays.

Great gateway game as it is really light.

RATING: 5.8
this game kills Monopoly for most people i've met (although i chalk this up to demand for good games among muggles going unmet for so many years and familiarity with "roll two dice, get money, build a house"). we very much enjoyed the base game, but it got very stale ("the twos are gone so it's time to see who'll be first to roll a four and buy a seven"). the Harbor expansion's new market layout was quite refreshing, but would often really swing the game. even using the Bright Lights modified layout with Millionaire's Row cards wasn't really enough to bring back the magic. my number of logged plays probably has more to do with this being a quick, accessible, replayable game rather than it being good. Card Kingdoms Valeria beats this game hands down for gamers' light engine building filler. Machi Koro still wins out the "family theme" battle, but i'm not sure i care to keep it around another few years just in case my in-laws need a non-Monopoly gateway dice chucker.

Simple fast light random fun. Reminds me a bit of The City (you gradually add more and more powerful cards to your city).

It seems to risk "runaway leader" syndrome as the rich get richer, and it can take longer than I'd expect to get enough money to finish, as it can be hard to save money over several turns for the high cost cards, due to lots cards which let someone else steal some money from you. But despite this, I still found myself wanting to play "just one more" because it's fun gradually building up your city. :)

Uses a lot of table space if you want to keep each of your types of collected cards visible and separate in a row. So far I played only 2-player and our fairly large table was very crowded and we kept having to rearrange our ever-growing city...

27-03-2015. Rerated from 4 to 3 after playing Harbor expansion. Wow. I dislike Machi Koro even more with Harbor than without. I thougth I'd like the drafting version of any game better, but here I just feel it increases the randomness and game length up to such a ridiculous point. While the game first was a quick race with a clear path to victory, it now is a long, drawn-out snooze fest in which if you are not lucky what comes up in the random market.. 

26-01-2015. Rated after 4 plays. Machi-Koro is the hotness.. or was it a short while back.

Machi Koro is an extremely easy game in which you build a city. Each round you roll a die (or two dice depending on an upgrade) and see if you get resources. All buildings have a value on the top that, if that number is rolled by the player, it triggers. Some buildings give you as active player money, some buildings give all players money and for some cards you have to pay when you roll it.
Whomever buys their 4th town upgrade first wins. 

The game is ok. I liked it as a very short filler. It's ok, it's decent.. but there is not much here. This game is INCREDIBLY light.

RATING: 8
**NOTE:  People I know who own this game said that several modifications and adaptations to the rules/setup were needed to balance out the game play and flow of the game in order to make it reasonably playable.  My review is based on using those mods.

Pros:
- Easy to learn and play
- Strategy with luck
- Nice artwork and theme
- Fast setup
- No wait times -- some cards are in effect on everyone's turn

Cons:
- The luck part can be pretty inconvenient.  You may be unlucky enough to never have any of the cards you need available on your turn for purchase.  You may also be unlucky enough to not have your numbers rolled very often though that can be compensated for by making sure you have diverse cards (assuming that you are able to buy them on your turn, a catch-22 thing).
- If you have a slow start, you fall behind, or if you're unlucky, it can be really hard (if not impossible) to catch up to the lead player, especially if you do not have any of the red cards.

RATING: 5
Seems like half a game to me.  There's just not enough going on.  I was really hoping for more depth, such as a spatial component a la Suburbia in placing buildings, dice manipulation, end game scoring, something. The win condition of racing to complete your landmarks is very boring.  I understand there's an expansion about to come out - not sure how it improves the game.

Very enjoyable light game, with familiar elements from games that I know and love. It has the Settlers element, of start your turn by rolling dice and see what players get. It has the Dominion element of a market of cards available for purchase, and the cards, if added to your "deck" give you additional powers. It has the Splendor/Saint Petersburg element of engine-building, with the strategy of timing your transition from the engine-building to the VP chase. All in all, a very solid gateway game that plays about 10 minutes/player, and plays very well (while differently!) with 2, 3, or 4 players. I have not tried the expansion yet.

UPDATE: I've now tried the game with the variable set-up, and expansion. I quite like the variable set-up. I found the expansions, while interesting, made the game drag on a bit. So a trade-off there.

This is sort of like Settlers of Catan with the following changes:
 - Board and spatial elements removed
 - Resource cards replaced with coins
 - Basic building tree replaced with a "market" of cards with more interesting abilities

So, it's not all that similar to Catan, but it keeps the core of rolling dice each turn and triggering things for everyone, not just the current player, which I think is a major draw to Catan.  I would most often choose this over Catan, even though I value lower luck and do enjoy spatial elements to games.  I enjoy the control I have in choosing which cards to buy from the varying market, and the satisfaction of having these chosen purchased cards activate on the dice rolls is just a lot more satisfying to me than the resource gaining from terrain in Catan.  

The game does have its flaws; I'm not sure the cards are particularly balanced, but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that all cards are up for grabs by all players... mostly.

The more I play this game, the more I like it. It's so simple. Just roll the dice, earn money, and buy more cards. Finding cards that work together, and then getting the die roll that makes them pay out is what the game's all about. It's super fun. I see my rating rising with repeated play.

I don't usually mind luck in board games, or games with an obvious dominant strategy that has to be blocked. But both in the same game, with not much options to mitigate either?

After some games, the most impressive assosiation with this game is its huge randomness: you might not be able to do things for several turn in a row, while your opponents develop and build their city. Sometimes you can catch up after a bad start but in most games one player was left behind with no chance of winning. One game was esspecially bad, where the last player  could finally safe some cash, but everything was stolen before he could use anything of it and the guy who stole everything won.

RATING: 4
Light and silly, but the sudden end just seems a bit anticlimactic. Choose from a raft of buildings and hope to roll the right numbers a lot. I'd prefer a Roll for the Galaxy type finish where the fourth landmark purchase triggers the end and then players count up the worth of their buildings (perhaps a 1-3 VP rating for each building).

If you're looking for a light family game dumbed down from Settlers of Catan then this is it. Trading is gone. Resources types have been consolidated into one - money. The race for position on the board is now just a grab for certain cards. It's a decent base system that could easily have been jazzed up a bit without adding much complication. Instead it's just too simple for me.

Really needs the harbour expansion to take it up another notch.

The most simple game of putting together a money machine that allows you to buy the basic buildings needed to win. Probably it suffers of a snow ball problem, but the game is light enough to still be fun and enjoyable.

RATING: 5.5
I don't really get the hype with this game. It's REALLY light, and doesn't really have any interesting decisions to make. It's just roll a die, see what you get, buy a card... which Dominion does without the dice, and gives me a better feeling to play. I'd try it again, but it's not really for me.

RATING: 6.5
For what this game is, it does it very well.  You roll just one or two dice a turn, and hope that you have buildings that match the number to give you income to build more houses and get more income.  It's not much more than that, but that's all it needs to be for quick, easy fun.

RATING: 7.9
Tremendously fun and easy to learn game. Machi Koro delivers an approachable experience with more depth than it seems at first glance. 
We found the basic game (where all buildings lay open in piles) a bit too easy to rig, quickly determining the most optimal course of action to maximise profits. 
The version with two rows of six is our favourite, as it caps the freedom of choice and forces you to optimise with what you have in front of you. 

All in all a solid game, great as a gateway for the more inexperienced gamers out there.

Love the quick, simple gameplay and the nice artwork. Would be nice if game publishers could start keeping red-green colorblind people in mind, but oh well... At least there are other ways to tell what's going on.

Biggest complaint really is the endgame conditions. I like the 4 special buildings but I don't know, it seems like so much of the point of getting them is using their powers and there will always be one that you never use except to end the game, and probably another that gets bought up only a couple turns beforehand.

This game just... doesn't work for me. It's so simple my fiance and I quit halfway through because it was boring for both of us, and funny thing she's the casual gamer not me.

Mechanically this game is a money-collecting dice-roller, plain and simple. I wouldn't accept an argument about it being anything other than that. You roll a dice, collect money, buy things to get you more money, get enough money you buy things that let you win. That's it. Snore.

The components are actually really nicely packaged, the money pieces are really nice, and the cards have absolutely amazing art. 

This game meets a certain type of audience and setting and that just isn't mine. Ridiculously Casual, Rules so simple kids could play. To a lot, that's an amazing plus and I would play this again but only WITH kids and only if a huge collective of my gaming group has some undying thirst to play.

As it stands I only have the vanilla so I can't say how much improvement the expansion will make (I will never purchase the expansion unless it's less than $5USD). 

Sorry Masao Suganuma, you just don't appeal to me with this game.

I was looking for a game that had a simple mechanic, simple scoring system and a moderate amount of luck so that my daughter and wife had a chance of winning. This game fit the bill in spades. A fun town building game that always seems to humble me due to bad dice rolls. We play with the random 10 card variant that the Harbor Expansion introduced even when playing vanilla. The game feels broken otherwise, new people love this game and it usually gets a few play throughs on game nights.

Machi Koro --

Played three-player.

Simple mechanics and interesting interplay.  In the basic game, I found myself selecting which cards to purchase based on the dice value which would activate the card and on the number of cards remaining of that type.  When playing with the expansion, the cards available were so random that I could not afford to delay the purchase of a card for fear that another of that type might not become available soon.

I really liked both versions of the game.  The basic version is more elegant, but the expanded version introduces more interesting interactions.

In both cases, the game starts a bit slowly, but as the game progresses, each player builds momentum.  I don't like the snowball effect when it is limited to the leader, but in this game, everyone will develop their own momentum.  Fun.

Machi Koro is a cheerfully illustrated fusion of [thing=13][/thing]'s dice activation system and [thing=36218][/thing]'s customisable combos. Players build a tableau by buying establishments, and race to construct all 4 personal landmarks before anybody else. 

The game's charm lies in creating combos and the interaction which keeps players involved throughout. However, there aren't sufficient incentives for players to roll two dice as opposed to just one. This is a major issue, because it effectively halves whatever strategic depth that the game offers. [i](Disclaimer: I haven't tried the expansion variant in which the set-up is randomised.)[/i]

There are other minor problems which are easier to rationalise away. Luck can snowball to crown a runaway winner or freeze a player out, but that's acceptable for a light dice game. The game also has a tendency to drag with 4 players. In short, Machi Koro is fun to explore for a few games, after which its static set-up and lack of card variety drags its appeal down sharply. Its expansions do address the base game's more glaring issues though.

Players are involved in everyone else's turn, as the payouts happen randomly. Player choice and strategy boils down to: when do I want my payouts to happen. If there are a lot of players, you want payouts on other people's turn. If there are few, payouts on your turn start getting more interesting.

I have found this game outlasts it's fun, but the recent official variant (separate markets for low, high, and special buildings) does a lot to fix that.

This game is a good synergy of cards and dice.  It's a bit like a modern version of "The Settlers of Catan" played only with card and dice.  I like it.  There are various strategic routes that can be taken to win.  I'm really looking forward to this being release in 2014 from AEG.

Vaguely reminds me of a stripped down "Dice City". The aforementioned game offers more options and complexity but this one is easy to grasp after just a few turns. Having said that, I think the path to victory becomes somewhat scripted and not sure if this will hold my interest long after 15-20 plays...perhaps the expansions will add more strategic options? With only a few games in I am giving it a stronger rating of 7...but that might drop over time w/o an expansion or two in the mix.

So I really wanted Machi Koro to be my Catan/Dominion hybrid that would be the best of both worlds, but alas it was not. Machi Koro has a major problem that we ran into in the first game and the problem has been in every game since. Sticking to one die ALWAYS beats out rolling two dice. So the second one person realizes this the game becomes a rush to buy all the low level buildings which is really repetitive and not much fun. The art in the game is great and the idea is great I just feel like a little more playtesting could have really helped this game out. I'll hold onto it for now and hope that a future expansion fixes some of the games glaring issues, but until then I will not be touching this game again.

Vicces kis játék a Machi Koro, kockás Dominionnak nevezném, bár itt nincs tényleges kártyakeverés, minden megvett kártyánk végig előttünk van. Mindegyikhez tartozik egy szám, amikkel ha körünkben kockával dobunk pénzt szerezhetünk. Pénz pedig a négy fő épület megépítéséhez is kell, amivel meg lehet nyerni a játékot. Vannak olyan lapok, amelyek minden játékos körében tejelnek és vannak, amik csak sajátban. Gyors, pörgős, egyszerű játék, de talán sokadjára már kicsit unalmas is lehet. A kiegészítője ezt javítja azzal, hogy mindig mások a megszerezhető piaci lapok, az alapjátékban ezek fixek.

RATING: 5
A simple dice rolling game that is heavily predicated on luck. There are a limited amount of strategies that seem to work in practice, with most games determined in the transition from rolling 1 dice to 2 dice.

The art design is good, and certainly makes the game attractive. The box is significantly oversized for the parts in it. 

All in all, it gets a little bit dull after a few plays as once someone has pulled out a lead it does become hard to stop them and there is limited options for different play styles.

Machi Koro recipe:

Step 1: Start with one part Dominion

Step 2: Mix in two parts Settlers of Catan

Step 3: Remove the fun parts of both games. Done!

You buy cards to... get more money to buy more cards with. Sound like Dominion? Yeah, except there aren't any cool combos and you never really feel "powerful"

You also roll the die on every turn to see who's stuff activates. Sound like Settlers? Yeah, but you won't be doing anything fun like trading or blocking people or interacting really at all.

Rolling the die and waiting for stuff to happen just isn't fun.

An excellent concept marred by sloppy rules. The original game had a dominant strategy problem which the expansion fixed.

Competitive dice-rolling, tableau-building game.  Machi Koro plays very quickly and is easy to teach.  The game involves a lot of luck, but that doesn't bother me as much as I initially thought.  The game is essentially gamer craps with a customizable payout scheme.  It's fun, but a little too high variance for my personal preference.

Is this broken? Might sound like a lot of dice games (even though this isn't really a dice game), but this game needs more choices for winning paths. Perhaps the expansions "fix" this problem.

Surprisingly good and pretty elegant. Essentially, you are making bets on which numbers get rolled through your purchases. There can be a bit of a runaway leader issue if someone gets a couple of lucky rolls and can prevent other players from amassing much of a bankroll, but fortunately, the game is pretty short, so it's not that bad. I think what really draws me in is racing to get some buildings built that give you money on common rolls and then seeing those bets pay off. It does a nice job of keeping everyone involved, as some of your buildings pay on anyone's turn.

UPDATE: The Harbor expansion really balances things out quite nicely, as it adds some wronky cards in the middle ranges, as well as some interesting options where you can turn 10+ into 12+.

For me, this directly replaced Catan. While my family enjoyed playing Catan, I found pretty much every experience frustrating and tedious. Waiting for the statistically likely numbers to come up...nothing doing...sitting there for a couple of hours watching other people not doing much.

Machi Koro feels like the more fun elements of Catan (dice rolling, collecting a resource to expand your empire) without the board and without the unnecessary length of playing time.

*Given away. The lack of mitigation for poor dice rolls has limited the fun for me so I've given it to me my parents who enjoy it more.

Because nothing says fun like rolling 3's all day long and being broke to the point that you don't even have the money that you were supposed to give other players. 

This is just a card version of Monopoly and is just as bad. Ultimately a chance-based game with no skill involved, just the illusion of choice.

RATING: 6
1 play, 4er

The game feels a bit like a light version of Settlers with special powers: you roll 1-2 dice, collect stuff (money), and use it to buy other stuff. And you generally want to spend what you got, so other people don't steal it from you! Going through the rules, it seemed like it might be fun. The early game, however, was disappointingly uninteresting: everyone pretty much acquired the same cards and had basically the same tableau. 

I'd like to try it again -- it's quick enough, at least -- but not sure that this would be a keeper.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player starts with 2 face-up cards and 4 face-down objective cards. The display has several copies of 15 or so cards. Each card is color-coded and numbered (1-12): the number(s) tell you when that card activates, and the colors tell you if they activate only on your own turn (green), on other players' turns (red), both (blue); or if they have a special power (purple). 

On your turn, roll 1 or 2 dice (your choice, once you've built one of your 4 objective cards). Cards with that number (or sum) may activate, earning their owner money or taking money from other players. Players may earn coins based on the roll. Then, you may purchase a card from the Display, or flip one of your 4 objective cards (the first player to buy all 4 wins the game).

RATING: 4
Yawn.  Imagine taking one of the mechanics of Settlers of Catan, rolling dice for resources, and stripping almost everything else out of it.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this game, it's just a bit boring because there's not much there.  Each turn a player rolls a die.  To start a roll of 1 gets everyone a coin and a roll of 2 or 3 on your turn gets only you a coin.  With this money you buy new cards that give you money based on other rolls.  Some reward whenever anybody rolls a number, some only when you roll it, and there are even two kinds of attack cards that steal money when either they or you roll a number.

The goal is to save up enough money to build four structures.  Each of these structures also gives you a power with the cheapest one allowing you to roll two dice opening up the options for which numbers are rolled and which buildings you should purchase.

There is only the smallest amount of strategy in which buildings to buy.  Obviously when you unlock two dice the numbers with the highest probability (7, 6 and 8, etc.) are the most worthwhile to pay attention to but other than that this is really just a game of luckiest roller wins.

I had high expectations for this game as it seemed as popular as Ticket to Ride and Catan or at least popular enough for it to be found at Target. I didn't mind the luck of the dice rolls as it is a short game. What did bother me about this game is that I don't see the point in upgrading to two dice. You already started building your tableau based on one dice, now half way through (or more) you are going to start rolling two dice and now decrease your chances of rolling 1-6, but have few cards in the 7+ range? The probability just doesn't add up for me :(

Have to agree with the reviewers who think this game drags too long. I can't recommend it at higher player counts. 

As it is mechanically similar to Catan, it suffers from the "Catan Rage" syndrome where if you are unlucky and keep getting bad rolls, it can really really suck. 

However, if you enjoy Catan but dislike the Negotiation elements and enjoy 7 Wonders without the complexity of hand management then this game is for you.

Variant for improved game with Machi Koro: Harbor Expansion:  Use a 3 Deck draw pile: Cards 1-7, Cards 7-12, and Purple deck. Initially draw 4, 4, and 2 purple. Also, play only with 3 or 4. Don't play with 5 people. Perhaps remove the Airport landmark for everyone. Also remove the Gaming Mega Store as it blocks a better card.

Beautiful artwork and nice, simple rules make for a very fun, light game. There are a couple of cards that are really overpowered, but there is a lot of dice rolling in the game so it's possible to beat them if they don't get activated. In the end, though, it's still a great game.

Very fun and quick city building game that uses some familiar mechanics but is a lot of fun nevertheless (or maybe because of it?). Dice activate the cards which can bring you income which makes other cards affordable and steadily you build up your way to open all 4 winning landmarks. Simple and simply fun! I really enjoy light and quick games that have still some bite to it and this one falls into that category. 
Only played with 2 players which works perfectly fine but I am very curious to see how more players charge up the dynamic of the game. 
3 and 4 have different dynamics, meaning the cards way in differently, I enjoy all possibilities of player numbers to play it with. Very light, fun game; pretty much 50/50 balance of luck and strategy which I personally like.

The mechanics are good; they encourage thinking about basic (1-3 six-sided die) probability and progressive gameplay.  It takes up a lot of table space for a card game, though.  Fun and quick to set up.  Game play length varies on strategy; usually less than an hour for two players in my experience.

The score really reflects the publisher more than the game.  Will likely never buy another IDW or Pandasaurus published game again.  Terrible communication, terrible quality assurance, terrible production decisions.  Just terrible all around.  Their print runs apparently differed such that the cards are DIFFERENT SIZES, which means that they're impossible to shuffle without clumping together.  Contacting them via email leads to nothing, and their sockpuppet on BGG doesn't address this at all.

The game itself is very mediocre.  Probably a solid 5.  Not short enough to fill the same niche as Love Letter or Lost Legacy, not deep enough to be worth playing over other games in the 30-60 minute slot.

Okay this is a 9 because we bought Metropolia which comes with the harbour expansion. I played it without this expansion for the very first game - my impressions were very flat - the game was okay I guess. 
We used the harbour expansion in the second game and the game just clicked with us. This is the game I will always recommend non-gamers to get. People who ask if you play Monopoly - I now reply that this is the game they need to get to play with their family.
The game is fantastic with any number of players and the randomness of which cards appear keeps you on your toes.

It is the game Monopoly should have been. It just feels like all the good bits of Monopoly to me without any of the bad.

Must have the harbour expansion though. Otherwise its a 6.

pretty decent dice game.  Runs a bit long with the expansion and 5 players, for the depth of the game.  Quite a few of the buildings are highly annoying.  There can also be a problem if someone gets stuck with just one coin and rolls 6s during the beginning of the game--then that is compounded if that person later gets hit by red buildings.

Takes long for the first play through or so, because no one knows the cards yet...is the game worth playing repeatedly in order to learn them and speed up play?  Leaning towards no, because we played it a couple times right after getting it and no one's requested it since.

The randomness to length ratio is poor.

This was a neat idea, but I think the attack cards prolong the game in an unpleasant way. Trading coins back and forth is not actually fun. If the game played much faster than it does, it might make a great filler. I picked up the first expansion because I thought more cards would offer more options. Unfortunately, it dramatically changed the flow of the game and made it even longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The base game by itself presents a case of great potential and clever mechanics faulted by the presence of a dominant strategy - the well-known Cheese & Factory as well as Convenience Store strategies - that are probabilistically much more viable. While this can be mitigated by all players going for the ingredients for these items equally, that merely moves the 'equilibrium' to another backup strategy, basically rendering the game 'solvable'. Future expansions are expected to fix this problem especially with the updated rule of only displaying a given number of unique establishments available for purchase at a time, but the base game as it is resolves to little more than mindless dice-rolling that rarely proceeds away from a 1-dice strategy, rendering half of the cards useless and the excitement of figuring out a tactic or strategy nearly non-existent as players can keep perusing any one or two build orders they devised in their first couple of plays.

Catanominion: purchase cards, which produce when specific numbers are rolled; there are various possible strategies and synergies.

The comparison to Catan does that game a disservice as Machi Koro is substantially less strategic; a lot depends on rolling a particular die on your turn. The totality is tedious and random.

Like Dominion, I'm willing to believe that bells and whistles in expansions will make the system as a whole worth playing, but the base game is not.

[Go Kids 16 edition] {City; dice-rolling, card-drafting; optimal 4p}  I got this game as a gift from a friend.

Machi Koro is a little dice game. I don't think it's a filler because the setup and the game play is not really fast-paced. In this game, players try to build their cities and buildings.  Each turn, the active player roll one or two dice and then players may collect income.  Afterwards, each player may buy one buildings.

Player interaction is fair because players can collect income in other players' turn or steal money from others.  A typical game can be fun and engaging, but I don't think replayability is particularly good.

The strategy is simple; try to maximise your income in a single roll.  I don't think spreading the buildings across different numbers is wise.

It is easy to teach the game.  My daughters can understand the game immediately.

The game component is so so.  The card illustration is cute, but not attractive.  The box is absolutely larger than necessary... BAD!

Most important thing to mention when commenting about this game is the fact that I had a lot of fun in a short time. It's always hard to compare games but I felt the Catanfun of throwing the dice and hoping you get your numbers and I felt the Dominionfun of choosing which cards I would put my money on. I must say there is a lot of luck but surely also a bit of tactics, I like the dosage for this style of game. It also builds up to a nice finale, with the 4 big buildings.

Machi Koro is a good introductory economic game - what could be more simple? Buy small buildings to make some money, use that money to buy bigger buildings which make more money, first to hit a certain amount wins the game. There's dice rolling too, which levels the playing field between skilled and less skilled players, and adds a certain level of obfuscation as to the best strategies. 

Unfortunately, the long-term prospects of Machi Koro aren't so good. It becomes clear after a few plays that certain strategies are better than others, and any solutions to this problem (as in the expansions) simply add larger amounts of luck to the game to try to hide this fact. 

In the final analysis the nitty-gritty balance of Machi Koro is not well designed. After maybe five plays I was done with it. Out of my collection it goes, which really is unfortunate - it could have been THE go-to gateway economic game. It could have been a contender - but, no.

While it has the buzz, I would really not recommend to play this with 5 players.. Game was drawn out to a stunning 3 hours, which is about 2 hours too long for what it offers. Roll, recalculate, (hopefully buy), pass the die. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Awful.

However, played this one before with three, and for 45min, it really shone. This game is meant to be fast and engaging. Its mechanics can hold that for up to an hour, after that it really fades away fast.

As a result of my 5p experience, I don't see this game having a lot of staying power once the buzz wanes.

[Edit aug 2016] we played this again with 4p and it was an enjoyable experience. I realised my bad 5p experience was with the expansion using rules as written. Now, however, we played base only with 10 slots open variant. Will never play otherwise again. It transformed this game from a dull dominion type ripoff into a enjoyable accessible game. In fact, my kids were so interested that i bought a copy myself and we have enjoyed quite some pleasant afternoons playing this game. Solid family game IF: play no more than 4 AND use 10 slots open variant.
Rating revised upwards by one point.

For me and my girlfriend it is a great short game. We still need to play it in more players to exploit the cards that require two dices, as in two players usually the one dice cards are enough for a quick victory.

This game caused quite the hype when it first came out, and now it's finally available to a wider audience, which is why I finally got to play it.
The goal is to build 4 cards before anyone else does. To build them you need money. To get money you buy cheaper cards that give you money. So all you do in this game is spend money with the hopes of getting more money. But there seems to be only one strategy: get cards so you get money on as many die results as possible. Then double up for some combos and hope for that roll that gives you a lotta mulas.
I'm not sure how much depth is actually here but it sure is enjoyable to play.

A perfectly charming and pleasant way to spend 20 minutes, but it doesn't really stick in the memory.

Essentially, your decision space in the game comes down to this: "Do I think I'll be consistent and able to roll the same number frequently?" If so, buy multiples. If not, buy a spread.

You may notice this isn't something you can control...

You're skimming this list to figure out if you should buy it.  Yep, you should.  I'm now a believer.

Machi Koro is perfection!  I currently own nearly 400 games and have played nearly 800 different games.  Um, I can't think of the last time my heart pounded as I set up a mechanism and rolled a single die (maybe 2).  

The artwork is super family friendly and inviting.  

I never wait for expansions, but on this one I can't wait.

My wife just REQUESTED it!  Nothing says more.  We play games in 20-25 minutes.  There are many routes to winning.

Amazing!  Superb gateway game too.

For a game so charmingly illustrated, it's a yawn. How sad. Even with the Harbor expansion, which seems absolutely necessary, I found myself wondering where the interesting decisions were hiding. There are certainly decisions to be made, but the game does its best to make everyone feel like they are accomplishing something each turn even if, in the end, you're merely building up a tableau of more powerful cards. It's a snowball of a game, where momentum is everything. The dice add a touch of randomness, and you'll need to spread out your buildings such that you cover as many numbers as possible (thus ensuring you collect something each turn), but the probabilities are hardly challenging to anticipate. For a game that is about racing to build your prestige buildings before anyone else, there was no tension until the very end -- and then the game was over. Where's the race? Where's the jockeying for cards and position?

In the city-building genre, I'd much prefer the new Quadopolis for something at the charming introductory level that is about optimizing points, or Suburbia for something at the advanced level that is about card/tile interactions. Neither game captures everything Machi Koro is about, but they each stand apart as better games. And that's the disappointing thing about Machi Koro. What it attempts to combine is interesting, but it never manages to rise about the level of interesting experiment.

RATING: 3
I played this game once with 4 players and saw no hope for the game. This is strictly a dice rolling game. It doesn't matter how good your strategy is, unlucky dice rolling will doom you. The strategy feels like it will be the same thing in every game. There was way too much "I rolled and received nothing. My turn is over." You know how that happens in early-mid game Settlers and then you have to wait for a couple of minutes while your opponents successfully roll their number and have to make decisions? Yeah, same thing here.

This isn't the type of game that I enjoy. Elder Sign is the game that I immediately thought of and compared this game to. I strongly disliked Elder Sign at first, but much like eating a food you don't enjoy, the more I did it, the more tolerable it became. I can now tolerate Elder Sign (though I don't enjoy it). That's what this game feels like - I hate it at first, but if I play it a couple of dozen times, it can become tolerable. 

This game is all about dice rolling. Sit around and watch everyone roll dice! Woo!

Machi Koro is pretty much Settlers of Catan but without the trading.  It has the weight and strategy of a filler, but takes the lengths of a light weight game.  It's OK at what it does and I could see it being appealing to non-gamers.  But we already have Settlers for that.

Good filler material!

RATING: 7
Settlers of Catan is brilliant in it's mix of easy to learn, deep to master; complex enough to satisfy hardcore gamers, approachable enough to involve your family members. Another good thing about it is it's a mix of strategy and randomness... Odd tile or number placement could result in some very strange and uneven turns, leading to lead upsets and keeping things interesting. While that part of the randomness is nice, on the other hand, being pigeon-holed into having resources denied to you is an easy way lose for sure, and really frustrates.
Machi Koro has all the same virtues, some randomness, plenty of strategy, fun for hardcores and casuals, dead simple to explain and learn, constant room to vary your strategies. It takes all that, and improves it... remarkably. 
First off, you always have access to all buildable structures. The only resource is money, and you use to build everything/anything. As a result, you have CONSTANT control over what your strategy is... no having to make a plan B because you can't get access to Stone or whatever.  You chose to rely on certain numbers or diversify. There's a random element, but it's basically all on you... Rarely did I feel cheated by the dice.
Also cool is no tiles... I don't know if some people LIKE tiles, but to me, they're a necessary evil... a randomized terrain is a super cool feature, tile decks are a way to make it happen, so you put up with them... but lord, what an awful way to simulate it... nudge anything and the whole board is a mess, the play field keeps trying to wander into player spaces or off your table, and it's a pain to put down and clean up. Machi Koro ditches all of that by reducing it's entire game to a set of cards, a pair of dice, and some money tokens... and a piece of scratch paper or a notepad program on a smartphone lets you ditch the token. As a result you can carry this game in your standary deck box. Love it. I can (and do) bring it everywhere, I always have a board game on me. Freaking brilliant.
If you're a real hardcore nerd type that likes everything better if it involves some elves and magic swords, you may want to consider looking at Card Kingdoms Valeria instead (as a slightly more deep/fun but also dorkier title) if your purse strings are tight... personally I think a good board game collection could make room for both though.
My one note? Think carefully about expansions. Like Settlers, which it bares so much resemblance to, I advise against the expansion packs to date... It's true they add a few nice new cards, most notably the expanded win condition cards, dragging out game length (which I like... again this game is pleasantly fast, sometimes it feels that just as things were getting truly exciting, someone is in striking distance of the win inside a turn), but they aren't terribly necessary and alter some of my favorite aspects of play for the worst.

RATING: 3
The amount of luck is huge. Sure part of the game is deciding whether to spread out on numbers 1-6, or start rolling two dice and go for 6-8, but still the person who has better luck will always win.

Also, at least in the base game, there seems to be a dominant strategy. You buy as many of the number 5 cards as you can, then eventually you buy the card that gives you extra money for having the 5 cards (I think it's Furniture Factory). This has won every game I've played, and it just comes down to who rolls the dice they need to trigger that combo the fastest. I've gotten over $50 on one roll with that strategy, which is enough to win the game, and there's really no counter to it. I'm hoping the expansion fixes this issue because I really want to be able to approach this game with different strategies.

Update: The expansion somehow made the game worse. I thought the variety would help, but I didn't consider a couple of things: luck can be an even bigger issue because now if one of the really good/overpowered cards comes out then whoever gets it is at an advantage. The game is also even longer because a lot of the buildings just don't synergize very well so you end up just collecting a few dollars at a time, hoping for a good building to come up.

It seems that there is just no way to make this game fun, despite the premise sounding fun.

Sold.

This high rating for Machi Koro is strictly for the base game with the 10 pile rule and with 3 or 4 players - played in this fashion,  it is an absolute blast,  with diversity in each and every game. 

The base game itself - with all buildings available,  is an average game,  at best.  played this way - my rating is 5.  Concerning the expansion, it is not only unnecessary,  it's actually a game breaker. You have been warned.

This game reminds me why I'm not a huge fan of dice games. Some dice games give you ways to work with bad dice rolls. This game leaves you waiting for your next turn if you don't roll anything helpful. Also, the variant with 10 random buildings is much more interesting than starting with all the buildings out. That should have been the original setup instead of a variant.

We have fun with this game generally....my daughter gets frustrated/annoyed when someone (usually my son) buys up a bunch of "red" cards and she ends up having to pay out her income to him again and again.

With the "base" setup it was usually pretty easy to quickly push for "the" winning strategy so we usually play with the random setup laid out with the Harbor expansion.

I've been waiting nearly 3 weeks and all I've got is an automated reply. Terrible customer service and quite a few people can attest to that.

Machi Koro is a very light dice rolling game. You roll some dice and score some coins, which you use to buy buildings... which help you score coins on dice rolls. And eventually someone gets enough coins to build all their "special" buildings. And that wins the game.

So yeah... there's some strategy here... but it's mostly just luck of the roll. Even for a short game, this was a little too random for me. It's not horrible, but there's not much that made me want to repeat the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Machi Koro has a limited number of solid strategies for buying establishments, which becomes evident after just a play or two. Once a player decides on their strategy, they'll simply buy the establishments that fit in with that strategy as they can, and then hope the dice rolls favor their numbers more than their opponents'.

The synergy of some establishments is so strong that a lucky roll or two can supply enough coins to buy all the goal establishments and win the game. I would prefer if the 'right' answers weren't so extremely right, I guess.

We've also drawn a deck from the base and two expansions a la Dominion, which worked well.

The box size is much too large (hate it a lot when pressed already for shelf space) and I added extra dice so four people don't have to share the single set that was included....

Look forward to the expansion so any 'obvious' strategies are tempered or fixed

After 5 plays or so, still not sure what to think. It's cute. My kids enjoyed it. I kind of wish it was more (I'm perfectly happy with light fun games) but then playing with the Harbor was laborious. I want to like it more than I currently do.

The Harbor expansion, so far (2 plays) takes a good idea and pushes it too far. Or maybe it widens the gap between how much I wish I liked the game (even more) and how much I actually do (slightly less). The idea of dealing out 10 cards for the market seems great, but almost "always" (tried 4 times) seems to create suboptimal choices and half-hearted strategies. The new cards are fun.

This is an ultra-light city building game that's fun on occasion.  All you do on a turn is roll the dice, check to see what you get from your buildings, and possibly buy another building.  It is a bit too simple to keep me engaged for long, but I'd still play it every once in a while.

RATING: 6
After a few plays with just the base game, I don't feel there isn't enough variety to keep it from getting stale. Adding in the Harbor expansion helps in some ways, but also creates other problems. I just don't feel much like pulling this one out to play anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Limited replayability for the base game. We are looking forward to getting the expansion to improve the replayability of the game.

However, this game has proved to be very popular among families and friends who do not play games as frequently. My parents and brother love this game and I definitely look forward to more of this game with them!

Downgraded it from 7.5 to 7. It does not scale well with 2 or 3 players. With lower player count, it is best to stay at a 1 dice strategy and buy lot of bakery and convenient store. The base game is more suitable as a four player game. Hopefully, the expansion can rectify this issue.

Machi Koro is a fantastic game for all the uses. The only thing that bothers me is why they use such a huge box for this tiny game.
Machi Koro uses a system very similar to Catan, but it improves this system by adding some new strategies with different card uses and colors that may be useful even if it's not your turn.

There is something very zen about the gameplay in this. It's not frantic, there's very little player interaction and for the most part, fate will decide on whether your little bakery driven town will thrive or not. But sometimes, that's what you want in a game - at times it feels like 2 games of solitaire where someone will eventually win. None of that is a criticism, I liked the frustrating gentility of this game and the artwork alone is really engaging. Highly enjoyable, looking forward to the Harbour expansion.

Together with Blueprints, the best filler dice game of Essen 2013 IMO. In this game, you build a small city with building cards, in order to obtain more and more money on a certain dice roll. There are multiple buildings of each type in the game, and they sometimes combo with other buildings, so the game offers decisions akin to any deckbuilder: Shall I take another one of those cards before the pile runs out? Or is this the right time to go for the victory cards? And all of that in a 30 - 40 minute game. Magic.
UPDATE: After playing the game many times more with two, I am looking forward to the expansion. Without it, there seems to be an optimal strategy (or two), and the game is getting a little same-ish.
UPDATE: With the Harbor expansion, I am rating this game an 8.5! Great stuff!

I am breaking with tradition. This is one game where an expansion (Machi Koro Plus) is a must for an enjoyable game. The expansion introduces a new method of playing using a random pile of 10 buildings available for purchase each round that is constantly being replenished. This randomization is key in making the game more fun and variable, not to mention more strategic. The static, basic core setup gets stale extremely fast as the opening moves for each game seem limited. Using the randomized setup, players must adapt with what is available on the onset and also react to how other players are setting up their economy engine. Fun! The ratings with the core set is a 4 while with the expansion, the game becomes a 7. 

I rarely if ever endorse an expansion. This is a rare exception and one that is crucial for a gamer to enjoy the game.

I have to laugh at all the critics of Splendor who claim it's too full of luck. The two games are quite similar - building a point generating engine.  I hear people defend Machi by saying it's a filler.  Well, so is Splendor.  And Splendor is even more simple to play and teach than Machi.  But it has less luck and more strategy.

Not impressed at all.  Baffled by the popularity of this game.

I'm not sure what the hype is around this game. My rating may be affected because I took the advice of Shut Up & Sit Down, who made this game sound like you'd be at a casino.

Definitely doesn't do it for me. The only viable strategy is to buy buildings with as many numbers as possible and race to the end.

It's okay. I like it better than my husband does. He hated it when we first got it. Now he sort of takes it for what it is, but neither of us ever seem to feel like playing.

Birthday gift 2016! If someone gets ahead, they tend to stay ahead. I can see why people dislike this without expansions, as there are only a few strategies, and it's mostly around cornering the market as soon as you can, assuming the dice roll in your favor to have enough money to do so. Enjoy it, but want to try expansions to see if there is more depth, and more variety of paths to victory, offered in them.

A fun, light game that's fast to learn.

Unfortunately, the base game has a huge flaw in that it's very easily mathematically "solved" (you aren't guaranteed to win as it's still random, but the best play is clear). This isn't a complex affair, either -- it was evident in the first few games of playing it, and after some googling to make sure I wasn't crazy, I found people statistically confirming it with play simulations and everything.

So, you need house rules to solve that. I never really tried any and the game ended up getting shelved after 5 or so plays until we got expansions. Still, it was a fairly enjoyable session and a cheap game, and house rules wouldn't be terribly difficult to implement.

This game took the random die-roll resource generation that annoyed so many in Catan, and made a simpler game out of it.  There is a little bit of strategy in how you build yourself up, and when you make pushes for bigger cards, but it's all just based on rolling the dice and getting money.  Can't say it really interests me at all.

Machi Koro is a very good game for occasional players. For more hardcore gamers, the base game is "limited". Let's explain it.

Let's say the game is in part hasardous because of the dice. Ok, it's not a problem when you know it and accept it. The winner can be chosen by a dice, sometimes ...

The problem is that it is an equilibrium game. You should never let a player empower in a strategy (the cafe/restaurant strategy or the baker strategy or ...).

So playing with people that doesn't know the game as well as you became boring ... cause they let you make your big combos.

BUT ... with extension, you break everything, because you can't choose your card as freely than in base game. So, use the extension ;-)

Fun at heart, but unfortunately never changes. Interesting to build an engine based around either one die or two and to choose which combination of cards you'll build around. However, since all of the cards are brought out in each playthrough, replayability is severely restricted. Strategies to winning are limited. Once you see someone going for one of them, all you can do is choose another one and hope you roll your numbers. Cute theme and somewhat fun engine-building, but only gives a brief window of fun.

There's a lot of luck involved, but also a lot of subtle strategy that can be explored. Don't get me wrong -- this game isn't based on luck, but rather, the adaptation of your spread to account for basic statistics and odds. Very unique and good-looking. It breaks out of the fantasy mold well but isn't completely abstract, either.

RATING: 6
The jury's still out on a final rating, but I was a little frustrated with being boned on the die roll so many times.  "But," I hear you saying, "you should have bought one of each possible die roll!"  Yes, but when I rolled three for three turns straight and had to give my money to all the folks with the Cafe, it was pretty damned annoying.  I like the way you build up an engine, and the way the game entices you to spend all your money each turn, but I'm not fond of the aggressive cards.

UPDATE: The game improves by adding Plus (the stacks of cards is variable each game, preventing a lot of scripted beginnings to the game), and also by playing with fewer players.  In fact, this might be a best-with-two game.

3 play: 4 players

There's no difference between this rating and the rating of my DIY copy, but IDW should be ashamed of themselves for this printing.  The cards are thin and wimpy, and a good number of the cards in my copy have ink stains on the backs of cards, or smudges on the fronts where the ink didn't take.  Is this a result of rushing the game to market, poor QC, or just that they don't care?

Once you figure out which cards work well together all you have to do is buy the cards and wait for the proper number to be rolled a couple of times and you win. The expansions fixed this somewhat but I still find it too easy to get the combos.

Macho Koro is a great game. It is sort of a modern day version of Catan without the board. The game revolves building a tableau of cards which collect coins based of the roll of the dice, and the first to complete a collection of 4 landmark buildings wins. The game is easy to teach and fast to play. There is a degree of luck involved, but there is also strategy involved in the choices of which buildings you buy in what order and it is a lot of fun.

RATING: 7.5
This game is fun. I really like the way you roll dice and pick cards to help future rolls. Luck is a big factor but depending what cards you pick is how your game will play. Plays fast. Wish you had more chances to get higher cards. By the time you can buy them the other players are almost buying the final card to win the game. I think the Harbor expansion coming out will make it better from the reviews I watched.

Dice and card drafting city builder with some interactive screwage. Quick fun. I like how the game plays. Roll a die, get paid, buy cards to better your odds to make more money to build your engine to buy the game winners. So simple but how much do you value the card price with the payoff?  Captures some of the excitement of gambling without the loss! The great thing is the Catan aspect where every player roll can impact several player thus holding everyone's interest. And, it is addictive buying cards for your city. Buy general cards that hit on every player roll or just your own, or cause them to give you points--love that decision and play interaction.

I liked the game after a single play, but there doesn't seem to be much available for variation in strategy.  Everyone wants to buy the same buildings and then hopes for the same dice rolls.  Players who get lucky upfront end up buying bigger buildings, making them even more prone to luck and wealth.  The game may be better with expansions if those expansions offer alternatives to earning money, but there simply is not enough depth here to merit many plays.

I really, really want to love Machi Koro. The aesthetic design is to die for, and it's a lot of dice rolling fun. But it feels so imbalanced against two dice strategies that I feel like I am getting only half of a game. So if everyone is on the one die strat, this game is a solid 7 for me. It almost is anyway, because I love the components so much.

I can not quite understand why people compare this game to Catan. It is also not a real city-building game. It is just a simple dice-rolling game about building up a set of cards that let you acquire money and have some special features. So the important thing is to buy cards that fit your strategy and that work well in combination with each other. 

What I like about this game is that you can use cards from the base game or from one of the expansions just the way you want to. If you dislike a special card, just do not use it. Balancing is not affected in every way, it just makes the game longer. This also opens up the game for custom or special cards. If the players know how every card works the standard rule where every card is available anytime may be quite interesting and the game gets very fast-paced, but may also become a bit boring after some plays when everyone uses the same strategy over and over. So we like to put some scarcity into it by only having five or six randomly drawn cards available to buy at the same time. The popular 5/5/2 (or similar) variant from the Harbour Expansion still offers too many different cards to buy in my opinion, especially in a two player game. I like the idea to buy a desired card as soon as it pops up before someone else does it.

This game does not have any special mechanisms and can get a bit dull, especially wth two players. But it is cute to buy yourself the same things over and over again that give you the benefit in the game you want to have over the other players. Not special in every way, but entertaining and with some personality to it.

Perhaps it is because its release date is semi-coincidental with the time my BGG adventures began, but it would appear to me that one cannot be a geek for more than a year and not hear about Machi Koro. And experience supplies the opinion that when this much buzz is happening around a game, it is one worth taking a good long look at.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Machi Koro has a couple key issues that make it hard to recommend over other similar games. At it's core, it's a gambling esque dice roller with basic deck building elements.

It's very basic and easy to understand the basics however there can be lots of confusion with the different types of buildings. With just 4 basic types it's a bit of a shame and people I've taught have trouble keeping track even after a game or two.

The biggest issue with the game is how difficult it is to strategize. The random nature of the game leads to quick games but you never really get a feel for why anything happens. As a result, the pay off for good rolls is much less satisfying. Usually players have a bit of everything and just about any roll will be middling to good for them.

For short dice rollers this is a suitable game, however be prepared for a mostly random game.

Machi Koro got quite the buzz, but I don't see it. Luck of the dice rolls determines how much money you have to spend, and choices on what to do with your money are not very interesting. 
Also, for such a simple game, it can look a bit daunting to new players, because all the cards are immediately available.

Very light and random. Plays okay with 2 but probably needs 3-4 to really shine.

A friend's description of this game reflected my thoughts quite well: 'It's fun... if you're winning.' To me, that really is Machi Koro in a nutshell. If you get lots of coins and have all these options to buy new buildings, it's great, just like in Monopoly or Catan. But if you barely get any income, this game is a slog, and it's nigh impossible to catch up. That's ultimately what this game comes down to: the player with the most luck gets more coins, thus more opportunities to build better buildings, thus even more coins, etc., etc., while the other player(s) can barely do anything to improve their position(s). And this game is MEAN for such a cute and fluffy-looking game: those red cards are absolutely NASTY! Those rounds where you throw a certain number and three players instantly hold up their hands like hungry pigeons because they all have red buildings that equal that number. Sigh... This game just feels unfinished to me. Like, 70 or 80% of a whole game. It misses some little extra to make it more interesting to keep everyone continuously involved. Because after a while, it's pretty obvious who's winning in this game! Less may be more in some cases, but Machi Koro could definitely use some more polishing to grab my interest.

2-5 players worth of city building, dice rolling fun. Players buy buildings from a randomized market, then throw dice to determine which of those buildings activate.

A nice twist to the dice-rolling genre, which helps to reduce the luck in a pure die roll and includes a little bit of strategy in the buildings to build. Interaction is reasonably high, but replayability is definitely on the low side. 

The game is not scalable despite the box saying 2-4 players. With 2 or 3 players, the green cards are too powerful. As one may expect, the blue cards get stronger as player count increases. This suggests game development may not be complete. To make it truly scalable, the benefit to price ratio has to change with different player count and different colour cards.

Component quality is decidedly below average and the game overpriced.

Machi Koro is very much a family game, and mostly for casual players. It is also better with fewer players. I play with the recommended five 1-6 cards, five 7+ cards, and two purple cards layout, but even then found that the game is horribly chaotic with five players. I may have to add more piles to five player games, or of course (as I am now) avoid playing it with so many players.

I may have come across this game too late in my board game life, but would not mind to play it every once in a while with family, or casual friends.

Next time I want to experiment with the latout of cards available. Perhaps try five Blue, five Green, 3 Red, and two Purple cards, for a total of 15 available for purchase. I will also try having twelve piles of cards for purchase, separated by the minimum roll required to trigger the card, so there would be piles from 1-12 of random cards. In combination I may steal a mechanism from my Thunderstone Epic rules, and allow each player to take one card on top of any pile, and put it on the bottom instead, although chances are that this will mostly be used to dick with each other.

I don't see the draw here. Cute and Japanese? 

Roll and move. Except you don't get to move. You always start on the 0 space and take the action of the card you moved to.

Okay so I'm being harsh. You get to build the spaces on your imaginary board. It still feels like a roll and move that isn't good enough when there are so many good games to play.

Machi Koro might not be something I'd request a lot at game night, but its a very nice light family style game that I'm happy I own.

Very random. The "go for other players" is too dominant and every game turns out the same

RATING: 6
With vanilla rules it's flawed, almost broken: just one "strategy" to win (buy all the convenience stores and keep rolling one die).
With the added rules from the expansion it becomes a stupid but funny dice game.

Decks replaced by IDW to match Harbor Expansion.

Game's short, but fun. Warning: When someone gets the Airport, the game ends quickly!

Sometimes you bump into a game, you’ve never heard of. A game which you didn’t notice in any geeklist at all. A game that, after you’ve played it, you’ll know that this will become a hit. A game that leaves you behind with a WOW! Such a game is Machi Koro. This might be the ultimate gateway game. Take a bit of Settlers of Catan (resources that will become available after rolling the dice), a splash of Dominion (card management) finished with a tuft of Carcassonne (city building), and blend it. Machi Koro has nothing to do with nor will it give you the feeling of any of these games, but it’s great in it’s own uniqueness. It’s easy to explain (each player rolls one or two dice on his turn. If the number of the building that a player owns matches the sum of the dice rolled, he gets the effect of that building. Then, with money in hand he can build a landmark or a new building. 1st player who completes 4 landmarks wins the game), has a lot of interaction in it, and it will provide you with a lot of fun. Also the artwork is very nice, and will let you smile. Too bad, this one sold out at Essen already on Friday, but I’m pretty sure a big publisher will pick this one up. Let’s hope he uses the artwork of the Japanese version, and he won’t ruin the rules.

I looooooooove this game, but after 4 plays I'm finding that there is only one strategy. I'm really looking forward to trying it with the expansion, I think that will turn this game into a must have.

This rating my change with more play (I could see the games becoming "same-ish" until the expansion comes out). But so far, I'm really impressed. The art is charming. It's simple to teach. The perfect gateway/family game.

I really enjoyed this game! It requires a decent amount of luck that can be mitigated with a good planning of your city.
After the first game, the game play is fast, but gives you the feeling of building a well oiled machine.

The base game is fun but a bit repetitive. I enjoyed the fist 10 plays but after that I'd rather play other games.

The expansions make the game way too long and some cards are too strong at higher player counts. Maybe if you customized the deck...

Surprisingly fun, despite it's obvious lack of strategy.  Playing with the Harbor expansion and alternate play rules makes a difference though

Simple with a lot of strategic choice.  However, you quickly arrive at optimal strategy unless you randomize the piles (like the harbor expansion tells you to).

We initially liked Machi Koro as a base game and ran into some problems playing with the expansion and it's setup. Although you get a more variable setup, you sometimes get stuck with a lot of cards you can't afford or aren't useful to you. Try playing it with the new setup from the Bright Lights set, which you separate the cards into 3 decks, cards that activate from 1-6, cards that activate from 7-14 and the special purple cards. That helps a lot.

The idea is fine, but the game is full to the brim with broken strategies and it's pure snowballing after the first time someone gets one of them going, as there is nothing to stop winners from winning more. The game is basically about who gets one of the broken strategies first, and then  it's a long slog until that inevitable victory becomes reality while the others are powerless to do anything about it.
It's full of bad design choices, buildings cancelling each other out in annoying ways, building combos of the same time/money cost varying widely in power, etc.

While the art is nice and cute, the production value of the "deluxe" version we played with is ATROCIOUS. It came in a dented tin box, first of all. All the cards were strongly bent in various ways, making it impossible to put them in a single deck. Many of the supplied landmark cards had the wrong card back printed on them, which made it impossible to deal them out correctly and made correct tracking of them an infuriating chore during gameplay.

Awful game, don't waste time and money on it.

Very enjoyable tableau building. High luck factor (dice activation à la Catan). 
If managed, a lot of pleasure is provided by a well rounded tableau. Getting stuck, however, can last a whole game, in which case, not much fun.

Hübsch illustriertes Kartenspiel mit Glückselement, aber auch taktisch. Schnell erklärt und deshalb gut für Leute, die nicht so oft komplexere Brettspiele spielen. Zu zweit nicht so gut wie zu dritt oder viert.

I feel like the harbour expansion is almost required (otherwise, the base game quickly becomes stale, since nothing ever changes so you have almost no reasons to change your strategy).

Still waiting a couple more plays before deciding on my rating.

I feel like this makes for an excellent introductory game, nonetheless (it's fairly fast and it's super easy to explain).

The gambling element plus the cute art makes this game a hit to casual players

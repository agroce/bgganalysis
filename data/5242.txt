RATING: 6
Like Hex - the game lacks character.  Only lines and dots are present.  Like chess - I won&#039;t play with someone who takes long turns.

I love connection games, and this one is excellent.

Very Good abstract connection game.  Can be played with pencil and paper which makes it quite portable.

Nice, fairly quick game. Kind of expensive, but components are outstanding and add to the experience(gotta love go stones on wood).  Worth adding to a collection.

A very involved, and involving game that takes Hex and grows forward with it. Excellent gameplay.

RATING: 9
Provisional rating since I've only played a couple of games, and on a small board at that.  But I enjoyed it as much as Hex, and maybe even more.  Since both players have the same objective, it had a different feel to Hex; it seemed like I often had more interesting options each move.  And it's even more elegant than Hex, since there is no distinction between sides.  Among "deep games," it may be the most elegant there is.

Good game, beautiful board, and rules for additional games. All of these descriptions apply to many games from Kadon Enterprises (//www.gamepuzzles.com).

Connoisseurs of this genre of games probably can point out the strategies that distinguish Y/Hex/Havannah one from another. I enjoy them all, but they feel pretty much the same to me. The Y board is small; an early disadvantage is hard to overcome because you don't have the opportunity for counterplay at the other end of the board that some of those other games give you.

I printed out a ton of Mudcrack Y boards for travel and it's my favorite "airplane tray table" game.  Elegant, simple to teach, and strategically deep.

I like the Kadon (non-uniform) board.  Have not played by email partially since I think the regular board is less interesting.  Generally I mostly play Unlur when I play connection games.

I use a homemade 19-hexagons-wide regular board.  The curved ones with pentagons mixed in just seems wrong.

RATING: 10
Addictive abstract strategy, with mathematical elegance that cannot be matched. It's impossible. The connection games (also [gameid=4112], [gameid=2759], [gameid=949], [gameid=3826]...) appeal to me because when they're done, they're done - no keeping score. This is my favorite of the genre, both players have the same goal (not quite true of Hex) and someone has to win (Sperner's Lemma). 

Can be played with pencil and paper, but the Kadon board is exquisite. Generally, my ratings take into account the physical product not at all. I rate the idea, the thought processes that one goes through while playing. On strictly that basis, I am no longer certain that Y is actually a better game than [gameid=34221]. Honest. For all I know, [gameid=11997] is even better. The attention-getting wood board though, the black and white stones, the 'clack' - that all pushes it up for me. The published version also differs somewhat from the version you'll find online. The seeming curvature introduced on the Kadon board has more than aesthetic significance: by shortening the distance along the edges relative to the distance from the center to the edge, the power is spread more evenly throughout the board, which makes for a game where the hot spots can move around quite entertainingly. (And it also looks cool.)


I'll mention here that the book "Mudcrack Y & Poly-Y" (which is not in the database, because it is specific to one game) has an excellent discussion of strategy. Like everything that I've read from Ea Ea, the themes of that discussion can be applied elsewhere as well.

Good connection game, but loses out to hex in terms of simplicity and elegance.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: Connect the three sides to win. A little more complex then its cousin of connecting two sides since you cannot forget about any side, but still leaves you wishing there was more to it.

RATING: 6
(The rating is an average of two different forms of the game.)

I actually think I like Y a bit more than Hex, but it needs to be played on a large board (like, say, 13-17 to a side) to really shine.  At that scale, I think Y is probably a high 8.  In its most common published form, it's a take-it-or-leave-it game (a 5 in BGG parlance) in that any single misstep can cost you the game, and going first almost guarantees a win.

So: 13/2, or 6.5.  I'll round that down to a 6, since I actually spent money on a nice Y board... that is the clearly inferior form.  Sigh.

Homemade version -- plastic sheet protector, printout, and dry-erase markers. Also own book "Muddcrack Y and Poly Y." Tricky to create aesthetically pleasing board with graphics programs.

RATING: 3
degenerate first player advantage.  Using pie rule is unsatisfying and the state state is still too small to be interesting.

update:  the game is mathematically interesting and adds some core mechanics to the connection genre, but that doesn't save this particular instance from being boring imbalanced computation

Comes with rules for:
1) The Game of Y

3) Singularity
4) Leap Over
5) Tetra
6) Quinta
7) Sexta
8) Solitaires

Very similar to Hex, one of my addictions. The Kadon board is very aesthetic. I would prefer an even larger extension of such a grid, however. Maybe 17 points along each edge, 345 total...?

Debate continues over whether this game is better than its great-uncle [I]Hex[/I].  I vote "yes".

RATING: 6.1
In a way, the rules are simpler than Hex. However. there are more symmetry axes which allow less variety. If you want to avoid swaps, there are only 2 (!) opening moves in Y compared to at least 5 in Hex. Further, the edge areas cover larger parts of the board than in Hex. Games are shorter in Y than on a Hex board of a similar size (e.g. Hex on 11x11 and Y with an edge length of 15). The two effects together leave Hex as the richer game.

The strategic advice contained in books like "Mudcrack and Poly-Y" is trivial at best. The designers do not understand their own game. This shows in board sizes that are too small for meaningful play, especially when played as Master Y, and in board geometries that cannot be balanced by a 1-move swap rule.

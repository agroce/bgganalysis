RATING: 5
Rating reflects interests in further plays, not whether or not I think the game is "good" for lack of a better term.

I corralled two wonderful, deceitful, negotiating type people for a game. It was our first game, and we triggered VC2 (we also didn't keep visual track of scoring so you couldn't sit and math out what your position was in an attempt to encourage gut-feeling based play). Three things come to mind. First, it's most interesting aspect at first blush is the novelty of actively working toward giving your opponents VPs instead of giving them to yourself. Second, with VC3, I think the game sort of falls apart from a historical perspective, but works better as a mechanical game aspect (although, does sort of work contrary to some of the constraints like "must try and advance" and all that stuff). The incentive structure if you get ahead is to sabotage the war effort and in our game that was very possible. VC3 gives you an out to still blow past and win. The die roll at the end was wholly unsatisfying for everyone and I can't think of an occasion where I wouldn't just use tourney scoring in the future; easier if nothing else. As a result, we didn't have much negotiation or manipulation in our game, you just sort of do your own thing as it didn't seem like the conference worked for what we anticipated would be involved in negotiating... I find that we spend more time and effort with political machinations in Fire in the Lake (even PBEM) than I did in our Churchill game and that surprised all of us. Third, it left all of us with a "hmm/huh" type feeling at the end. I don't know if it's bleh or brilliant. Not the first time I've seen a game turn out this way on the first play, Mottainai took me until game 8 or so to really see through it and decide whether I liked it or not. I readily profess that I don't understand the majority of the decision space and I can tell that because I can't seem to find any sizable one to start with... 

On a different note, I wonder if the game is delicate in the same manner that A Study of Emerald can be. It's not that I'm against that, I just don't understand yet what Mark Herman is trying to get players to do, there seems to be some contradictory factors at play that caused all of us to sort of plod along. I also think that I have this reaction as so much of the game is based around the conferences, and I didn't find them interesting from a negotiation standpoint (maybe that it's referred to as a negotiation game is a mistake on my part and our expectations are unrealistic). I do agree with the prevailing wisdom that you have to play all 10 conferences; less and it's almost too little setup. The VCs are interesting, and from a design perspective it's an interesting addition. I'm not sure the rest of the game warrants an almost 5-6 hour play time for us though. 

Last, the solo game left much to be desired... As with many other games that shine at 3p, do so.

Mechancially quite simple with a programmed approach to the phases. Strategically deep and as good quality wise as anything GMT have ever done. Major issues with the endgame. Will need a few more plays for a better judgement.

EDIT : Had time to think about this game a lot. 3 nights and over 10 hours play for the mess the end this degenerated into makes me put this firmly into the "interesting but flawed" pile.

RATING: 9.5
The most accessible game covering (the last three years of) WW2 at the grand strategic or geopolitical level for adults I’ve ever seen. The amount of interactive detail it packs with historical flavor is astounding but at no time is anything complicated. An experienced player should be able to teach it in five minutes.

A three player game playable solitaire against “bots” programmed for each side and controlled through a simple single-paged chart of priorities. And with components so well thought out.

Rules organization could be tweaked but all issues have been well answered by the designer on the forums. Read these rules literally, only what’s there, not what isn’t and things should flow well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Solo play is a bit disapointing.  Bots are not really AIs but more instructions on how to handle missing player's hand.

Otherwise, the game is very thematic and the mechanics are very good.
Hoping to get to played it with 3 devoted players someday.

RATING: 9
Another gem from the greatest game designer in the industry and all-around great guy.

This may move up to a 10 for me. I like to get in enough plays to feel comfortable before I do such a thing, but I can tell you that I had great fun with this.

The game has 2 parts: a debate track, where you "debate" certain topics. And then there is another part, where you take the results of the debate and manage the war.

It's really not your classic wargame, any more than, say, Cassablanca is a war movie. Both have WWII as their backdrops. Managing the war is really more about managing your resources.

But this game shines in oh so many ways. The debate track has a lot of feint and bluff in it and with 3 people doing it, you have to outmaneuver two people.

I think my favorite part, though, was the war track. I don't know -- maybe the wargamer just runs that deep with me.

But here's the kicker: if you win in a rout, you lose the game. You have to win, but at the same time, all 3 of you have to "win" in that you are going to compromise and not get everything that you want. This part really bugs some people. I suspect that is for those who want to play a game once, figure it all out, and move on to the next thing. This is not that game: it is not going to reveal all of its secrets that quickly. You are going to have to spend some time with it and experiment. Once you have that down, THEN you have go out and beat the other two people. When you play this enough to get it all down, then you will certainly have enough plays and time invested to have got your money's worth.

And yeah, yeah, I'm Mark Herman's biggest fanboy... guilty. But I like some of his games better than others. Overall, his body of work is amazing. Where will this fall? I don't know: it's too early to judge. I doubt I will ever love it the way I love [thing=38996][/thing] and [thing=11825][/thing]. Those games are as close to a religious experience as one can have in board gaming. But Churchill is one danged fine game and I suspect it will proudly take its place alongside [thing=2076][/thing], [thing=833][/thing], [family=120]GBoH[/family], and [thing=5656]France 1944[/thing]. No matter where it falls, I think this and [thing=620][/thing] are the most radical designs Great One came up with in his illustrious career.

This game is really very interesting. Different from anything I ever played before, it is a game about discussion, decisions are made based on the plots discussed on a round table. The political and military accuracy of this game is impressive and the feel of this game is that you are an Ally leader discussing the decisions taken in the war.

The results are incredible and I want to play the complete game one day.

RATING: 8
Preliminary rating after two plays, one of which was riddled with errors. 

There seem to be correct ways to play the conferences, at least for the Soviets and British. British seem to need to go first in the majority of conferences and the Soviets need to make use out of as many of their bonuses as they can, especially the Nyet bonus. Debating can be hard to pull off as the Soviets if the US and Britain want to fight over stuff.

Players really create the board state, which in turn heavily informs the conference play and so on, creating a nice cycle. The random events seem incidental, which is nice. 

I'm not really sure how much I like it yet since the first game was full of errors and the second was a bit lopsided. Right now I find it more interesting than enjoyable and I don't know which direction my feelings will swing as the game tightens up.

Update: this is a solid seven. I love the conferences and am underwhelmed by the map/resolution phase.  An excellent game for a new genre but it comes up just a little bit short.

Update: further play brings further appreciation. Up to eight.

RATING: 9.6
What an incredible simulation so deeply steeped in theme! In spite of the abstracted (and rather fiddly) Decision Segment, most of the time you feel like YOU are there, at Quebec, Yalta, Potsdam, etc. And there is so much uncertainty as to what your opponents are going to do next that almost every turn you'd like to pass; and most of the time, you're not allowed! Yes, it's that painful. I just can't imagine any two games of Churchill being alike. And how to balance the distribution of your won resources: you just never have enough to do everything that needs to be done.

I'm of a divided mind on the question of keeping a running score. By doing so, it will indeed make the game-ending anti-climactic; but by not doing so, the game can end with the horrible surprise of learning you were doing much better than you had thought; so good, in fact, that you've lost the game! Maybe it is better not to have an ongoing tally of the VP; and besides, the provided score-track is an example of terribly unclear graphic design. As are some of the colour choices: for those of us who are troubled by such things, the blue and green Clandestine Network markers are very, VERY difficult to tell apart. And what's with the POST-WWII map of Asia and the Pacific?

My rating is for play with humans, as opposed to bots alone: playing the bots is rather tedious, and gives a human player far too much intel about how they will play. We use a much simpler and much more random system for the bots; and although I would play solo again, it is a shadow of the experience you get with at least one human opponent.

My rating would have been a 10, if not for the large time commitment required, and the difficulties in finding two willing human opponents. Definitely one of the best historical sims ever made!

A lot of wasted typeface on how this game is 'broken'. It's a fun game, particularly with the right people. I don't think the victory conditions are quite spot on (scoring on the Med) but equally they don't ruin the game.

RATING: 6
1/21/18: I'm feel that this is more of an experience game than a "play to win" game.  It can be real twitchy on who ends up winning.  I'm sure that with more plays it will evolve more into who has the best strategy, but it seems to be quite a bit of which person was leading and got pulled back allowing another to win.  At 6 hours per game I come away feeling a little disappointed.  On the other hand, maybe this is just the nature of three player games.  So far the Soviets do feel like they are the least fun side to play.  (Yup, have played them multiple times, and don't enjoy it.)

:star:  There is no other game that will cover WWII, and the struggle for post-war dominance like this one. 
:nostar: Snide remark. Any time you play a game and at the end need to read multiple paragraphs and spend 10 minutes trying to figure out who actually won, something is wrong.  Apparently its somewhat smoothed out in the second edition, but it clearly is a problematic mechanic.  But the ugly truth is that this isn't the only wargame with victory conditions bolted on to the game.

9/17/15:  I've got mixed feelings about this.  It seems good as a tool for learning some of the history but the victory conditions seem a little wonky.  It does a good job of highlighting the squabbling and maneuvering that took place.  There doesn't seem to be much to encourage you to winning the war, and that does seem that it should be your last priority.  

As a Western leader, it seems that you should do everything possible to keep Russia from getting started with their offensive.  Ignore creating the second front, and you can additionally hose the Russians by putting Soviet directed offensive on the table every time.

It's very possible that my thoughts are based on playing with other people who are new to the game, and that my thoughts will change with more experience.

A multiplayer game where the person ahead won't necessarily win and the game provides a reasonable thematic explanation  for it. That twist is interesting but can be confusing due to the many ways of scoring, which requires a lot of experience to tell who is actually leading. I'm still mostly confused but do appreciate what it is representing.

Update: After three plays I've concluded the game is really about calculating point differentials between the players and I don't have a lot of fun playing it.

The image illustrates where the doubters and naysayers go because they differ with those who worship "The Great One."  A pretty place, indeed, and it beats getting lost in Chicago.  

The rating represents the behaviour of certain Churchillians--Churchellians--toward those who do not bow at the alter of this game.  Please do not judge Churchill on the basis of my rating.  

Among wargames, I have never come across such a vindictive and mean-spirited effort to attack Churchill's critics.  Those people like Chris Farrell are accused of losing a sense of perspective, but it is some of the Churchill Gang, which includes some normally nice people, that are leading the personal attack--and attack is what it is--against certain critics of the game.

This is NOT to say that Chris Farrell is correct when he calls the game "broken."  Even he seems to be in a bit of a fix as to what he means by "broken."  When I think of the term, I think of trash like Ticonderoga, which is totally unplayable.  People have every right to love or dislike Churchill.  Those who say that it is broken have the burden to prove it.  I did not--do not--believe in things like "The Halifax Hammer," which, like many an urban myth, is now "fact."  And I still think A Few Acres of Snow is a great game.

The Churchill Gang is like a 21st century version of the Salem Witch Trials: let the burning of the nay-sayers begin.  And here is a comment left by Rusty:

"When someone says "I just didn't stick around for the debate after it seemed to be going toxic pretty quickly," and the reply is insults & weirdness (were you stalking him at GMT West?), you make him look right."

Mark Herman has it easy.  He never has to dirty his hands, or his reputation, because others are more than willing to defend him; and the best defense is to attack.

If there is a negative in Churchill, it is those devotees who have lost their perspective--their minds, too?--when it comes to defending Churchill against the minority who do not like it.  Some defenders manage to state their case without getting nasty; others just get nasty, and then get more nasty.  Why would anyone in the minority want to stick his or her head into a verbal meat-grinder?  The personal attacks are a way of stifling free speech because you are going to need a thick skin before you go toe-to-toe with these "gentlemen."   The 1 rating is not the game, but these people who are simply "awful" and "defy description."

December 2016.  I gave the game away to someone who is a Mark Herman devotee of a different order, and who will, I hope, appreciate the game more than I do.  I mostly gave it to him because he is a hell of a nice guy who has had my back, while doing much heavy lifting for the wargaming community.  Mark Herman's effort at AI is light years behind what other designs offer, if, perhaps, only because most other games offer nothing.  But I never found the gaming "narrative' to be enjoyable or convincing.  I cannot imagine my game club at school doing anything other than looking at Churchill with the same expression my Guinea pig often has.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After a few more runs of this game, both in solo mode as in 2 player, I think Churchill is simply not a good game. I REALLY wanted to like it as a Consim like Labyrinth the War or Terror or Twilight Struggle but it doesn't.

Also while it is being advertised as a 1-3 player game its solitaire rules are VERY thin and the AI bot is nowhere up to Labyrinth's solo play.

At the moment it is to be AVOIDED as a pure solo game.

---- Here are some points why the game is not so good:


1. The standard game is way too long (5 hours) to sit through in one session with 3 people. The Campaign lasts 10 hours even.

2. The Conference table is pushing abstract issues up and down each player's space with cards. Sorry but the system looks and feels dry. There is a difference between putting influence counters on countries like in TS or Lab and making a game where the decision making around a conference table is the main gaming mode.

3. The different WW2 fronts are almost there as an afterthought. A few spaces deep and that's it. ONE DR decides if you advance or not one space ... after you pushed issues on a conference table for almost 45 minutes per turn...

4. The game does not lead to a debating afterwards between players because it lacks both thematic story telling AND the VP's awards system is a mess.

5. Talking about that scoring system: you have 26(!) different ways of scoring points. And when you win with too many points the second player actually wins the game. In other cases the leader substracts points on a DR, while the last one adds points from a single DR.

Excuse me ? But that alone is a terrible end for a game that lasted ... 5 to 10 hours.

Quite frankly the game with the current VP system is broken because the VP handicaps are strangling the game on historical facts.

Even winning the War is not a priority IF you want to win with the mind of a Euro player.

Of course Mark Herman is a living legend within the industry but Churchill is not his master piece, sadly.

------

My prediction is that the game will sell very well (it did already) thanks to the name and fame of both GMT and Mark, but it will not see much play from many players afterwards.

I think you can find a lot more and better games if you have 5 hours and 3 players around a table.

I'll rate it a 4.5 because of the initial innovative ideas, but I don't see me playing it much in the future despite the awesome historic theme... and I am sad for that ...

Things to change:

1. Standard game should be around 2 hours with the long term campaign taking 4 hours.
2. Change the VP system or end game awards.
3. Do something about the War Fronts and apply some more than a single die roll.
4. Create a decent solo game with - if needed - different mechanics of card draw so players don't see the cards from the AI until the very last moment.
5. Keep this basic idea and create another historical setting but with much less conferencing and more war mechanics.

An interesting political / area control game.  The playtime in the 5 round version is probably perfect for me, but wouldn't mind trying the 10 round version soon.

Having done only a few rounds so far to get into the rules, what has been presented is enjoyable, nail biting and consistent. The randomization is not over the top and the conference between the players really makes a difference.

Somehow this game never clicked for me.
There are a lot of cool concepts in it, but for me it felt much more like a game and never gave me the feel of WWII at the grand strategic scale.
The diplomatic conferences are very well done and they effect the situation on the board, but I really felt I was missing more interaction the other way around as well.
Playtime for a anything but the intro scenario is also far more than I had thought it would be, which for me means it wont hit the table often (which again means further increased playtime as players are less experienced)

Very interesting game with a great innovative concept. You really feel like a nation´s leader struggling for your own goals and political influence against your allies while you still share some common interests. The only issue for me is its length. To get the real WWII feeling you must play the full campaign, wich means 10 conferences. The game lenghth itself is not too bad, but it gets a little repetitive after conference 6 or so...

I did not read the rules but picked the game up very quick and found it all quite intuitive. Need to play more to understand the game and the victory conditions which seem quite detailed and subtle. I was coming last at the end of the game but we all rolled some dice and I ended up winning.

After three plays, I doubt there'll be a fourth.  I still have little idea how the tactical decisions fit into the strategic.  As such, I don't yet know whether there's any strategy.  Beyond that, I cannot identify a thing that I learned about the subject.

First play was intriguing. Tournament, played as US. You get a rough feel of what the 3 leaders are supposed to push, US - A Bomb, Churchill - colonies, Western Front(?), Stalin, A Bomb(?), sneak out conference wins?

Looking forward to more plays. More interested in playing the other countries, but friends are interested in playing the full scenario, which I can imagine will be quite interesting too. 

Whilst not a wargame per se, this has rekindled my interest in the topic, which is what many experiential/procedural wargames are about, in a sense.

I'm sitting here after gaming at the GMT West Weekend at the Warehouse, and as is my wont, I've been sort of iterviewing people on their experience with Churchill, just to figure out what's going on with the game (Pericles is just out, which gives me an opportunity to grill people). It's still popular, but a lot of people are playing solely against the bots, or not actually getting enough play in that I would consider their opinion of interest (just a couple games). However, I have talked to a few people who have really enjoyed the game, and the theme seems to be that a) they play the full 10-turn game, and b) they play that unless the Axis is defeated, everyone loses - either as an explicit rule or as the metagame. I think there are good reasons to dislike the game anyway (and I actually didn't see that many people playing it this time - Triumph & Tragedy was more popular) but I can see that this set of house rules would be a much more viable enterprise.

Even before this it did annoy the hell out of me that the rule book protested that the shorter games were totally tested and balanced and were fully developed in their own right, when the game was *obviously* designed around and optimized for the full 10-turn game and the tournament scnenaro was just a truncated version. I dunno if I really want to put the time in on the 10-turn game (which seems totally excessive) when I could be playing Greenland or Neanderthal or Triumph & Tragedy, but I admit to some curiosity to give it a try under these conditions just to see if it doesn't suck as hard.

Good lord, I can't believe I'm wasting all this ink on this game. But, here is another piece of analysis for your consideration. Wargamers who I've played this with have been generally OK with it. They treat it in sort of the same was as the COIN games, they ignore or play down the point scoring and victory conditions and play with historical motivations and the game engine comes out with a pretty much random result at the end, somebody wins, nobody thinks about that too much, and everyone goes home (reasonably) happy. If you stick to the history and don't look at the victory point schedule too closely the game sort of works. But none of the people who play games other than wargames who I've played it with have thought much of it, because the design is aesthetically such a mess, because it rewards such ridiculously unhistorical behavior, and because - let's face it - the history is pretty bad. Some gamers have found it completely broken (I think I'm in that camp now), some have found some elements interesting but the game as a whole unsatisfying.

This doesn't change my rating or analysis below in any way. But the game clearly does have a metagame sweet spot where it'll be fun, and obviously people are finding it. But you will have to stick to that metagame, and I think that's going to be extremely difficult long-term.

---

Oh dear. Play 5 completely broke the game. I was playing the game intuitively, trying to win the war and play historically by default until I had fully grasped the implications of the obtuse victory condition and scoring rules. This, unfortunately, gives the game way too much credit. As soon as I got it in front of player who was actually, like, playing to win from the get-go, he clearly demonstrated that the scoring and VCs were in fact completely skewed (it's a clear and simple fundamental principles argument based on available VPs which maybe I'll post). The UK/US in fact have extremely little incentive to invade France or defeat Germany in the Tournament Game, the Soviets are incapable of defeating Germany on their own (again in the Tournament Game), and from this the entire game collapses.

I think there is a simple fix: just play that if the Axis are not defeated, all players lose; if you win the war by conference 10, the players win, and the individual victor is just the player with the most points. No screwing around with the insane and obtuse VCs in the RAW. And you need to be very explicit: if the players don't defeat the Axis by conference 10, that's a worse result then losing on points at the end. I think that'll do it. But honestly, I don't have a lot of interest in finding out at this point; I feel like I'm doing the work the designer should damn well have done himslef.

I rate the game out of the box a 2 for the ridiculous VCs. You might be able to fix it up into something decent with the right house rules, and those house rules might not be that complicated. I'll consider revising my rating when the game shows signs of having been playtested.

---

Last comment on this game for a while:

First, I suspect this game might be much improved by simply going back to what was an apparently an earlier iteration of the victory conditions, where the players simply lose if they don't defeat the Axis by the end of the game. With defeating the Axis in a timely manner optional (and actually not in the interests of one player, probably), there is very little pressure on the players to do historically rational things.

Do try to avoid playing the Soviets. They have little to do and their sucky conference leaders combined with no military options makes them tedious. Also, unlike the US and UK, their position is fragile because the other players can pretty much totally screw you by putting your own Directed Offensive on the table. The UK also have limited options, but at least their ability to usually set conference agendas gives them some control. The US is in by far the most interesting position, but the military drain will make it hard for them to win. Without a requirement to defeat the Axis, the Soviets seem pretty screwed.

Start with the Tournament scenario. The learning scenario is only for teaching at cons; it's pretty trivial and almost totally uninteresting.

Like many of Mark Herman's games, I find myself taunted by the game this could have been, but stuck with the game that it is. I think what it is, is an interesting idea that's fun for serious gamers to play with just to explore as a gaming idea, but not a very good game.

---

I respect Churchill a lot for trying something really interesting and worthy. I just don't think it's that good, mechanically. It's crazy-random in ways that are annoying and frustrating (especially for the Soviets, who seem to have a variety of issues); the victory conditions are weird and opaque and random; a number of the elements of the design are just weird (mandated offensives, the total equivalence of all minor nations, the fact that none of Britain's colonial interest are actually in British colonies). And despite the rulebook's protestations, the 5-conference game is just not all that interesting. Too many options are off the table, options are too constrained, the wild randomness doesn't have enough time to come out in the wash, and a number of design elements become even more random. But playing 10 conference seems like it would be a slog.

So I dunno. I think I'll probably keep playing it a bit because it is unique and the idea is quite clever, but this is an idea which could have benefited from more robust development. Keep trimming it down a bit, prune a few more ideas, cut the playing time by 30-40%, fix some of the dubious historicity, tune the VCs a bit (I like the idea behind them, I'm just not sure they work in an interesting way as calibrated right now), maybe you've got something really good.

Played twice; enjoyed, so there's that. I like the decks of different personalities with their different strengths and weaknesses on various issues. The agenda/issue/debate mechanics are simple and while not hugely inspiring they do basically work and give a rather nice historical feel to how the issues played out. The "wargame" side plays fast and while the flowcharts for reserve allocation do not seem to be written in English, it works nicely.

The things I'm really scared of are the victory conditions and final turn. The different last turn conference set-ups are insanely swingy; if Churchill gets reelected that's huge for the British, and a Soviet Directed Offensive in Manchuria is doom for them if they haven't won in Europe already. If the Soviets get a bunch of staff that given them extra offensive support markers on the last turn they may have a chance to get into Germany; otherwise probably not.

And the victory conditions. Oh, the victory conditions. I see what he was trying to model, and it's cool in theory. In practice, it means that a player who's winning by a lot is strongly incentivized to torpedo the war effort. A player who would go from first to first loser under condition 2 (because they are too far ahead) can guarantee the win by simply throwing the war. This is not that hard to do; the Soviets can sabotage the A-Bomb fairly easily with Stalin, and anyone can fairly easily upset the delicate Japanese surrender timetable. Given that it's not that hard to kill the war effort, I fear the whole thing will just degenerate into Pol/Mil and Global issues while exerting minimal effort on the war if players play to win too much. It'll be interesting to see how it works. You'd think it might be self-balancing, two players could check a runaway winner who is tanking the team by simply winning the war, but I don't see how you can make the points work out. I'm not saying this is definitely a thing; I could be wrong on this. But it definitely worries me.

Anyway, this is one of those games where the process of playing is fun, so the victory conditions can be a little wonky and the game can still be fun. I'm worried though, and I think there is a chance, that they might just not work at all.

Last thing, the designers notes protest that the "real" game is the Tournament game, but I think that's not really true. The game clearly wants you to play the whole 10 turns; there are a lot of things (staff death, the Mediterranean VPs, the CBI track) that only make sense in the context of a 10-turn game. 10 turns looks like about 5 hours. That's not terrible actually, but probably longer than the game wants to be. The 5-turn tournament scenario is fine, but honestly doesn't have a ton of breadth.

I played a very early playtest version of this and wow, it was direly bad, but I downloaded the just-published rules and it looks like it's been totally overhauled. That's good. After reading them I was intrigued enough to want to pre-order, but then I saw the price - $89 retail? $60 pre-order? That seems nuts for a 3p card game that doesn't have a ton of rules or components. Phil Eklund did Greenland for $35 retail. I guess they figured out that Mark Herman's name justifies a big markup after Fire in the Lake, but I'm going to need to wait at that price.

I feel compelled to note that Mark Herman continues his flirtation with dubious history; the design note on page 5 is misleading in my opinion. While it's true Churchill would get bogged down in Mediterranean side operations later, he did not delay D-Day in order to "enable his Mediterranean strategy"; he and his staff focussed on the Mediterranean because they felt, entirely reasonably, that the US staff had no idea what they were doing and that D-Day in '42 or '43 would have been suicide (a view vindicated by the various tactical and operational debacles in North Africa and to a lesser degree Sicily) - and the Mediterranean was the best way to take the war to the enemy. To assign selfish motives to Churchill for this decision seems wrong.

I liked the theme and the card bidding was interesting enough, although sometimes that seemed to break down as cards became worthless. I'm not wild about negotiation in games, but this was OK. Mastering this seemed kind of dependent on really knowing the point valuations for every action, but I'm not a big GMT person in the first place, so I'm probably never going to come back to this unless really pushed.

This game absolutely achieves what it sets out to do: instruct you in the ways that Grand Strategy elicits both cooperation and competition between The Big Three.  It goes beyond 'theater of the mind' and allows you to explore the give and take (and take, and take) that upsets the delicate balance between so-called allies, leading to less than optimal results in a post-war (soon to be Cold War) world.  This is not a game for 'gamers'; it is a 'not-so-distant' mirror of dynamics between those who wield great power, those who can send thousands of men to struggle and die with a flick of their hands.  Look beyond the game into the meaning behind the game, and you will find that Churchill is one of the most revealing strategy games that has been published in years.

Very innovative game about Big Three struggle for supremacy during and after WWII. 
Interesting discussion segment, when we debate various issues and in what way issues support war and politics goals. 
Game is rich in negative interactions, short-lived agreements and alliances. Ultimate winner is that player, who win other players against themselves.
Full Campaign game recommended (10 conferences).

Okay, let's start this with a hesitant/hopeful 8.  After one play I'm of two minds on the game:

1. I'm worried that the various victory conditions are two unstable and that there are simply too many moving pieces.  The game seems to force you to play sub-optimally.  I'm fine with this but in practice it just keeps everyone in contention till the end.  Does this mean the game has little strategic dimension?  

2. On the other hand, this game is fun-as-hell.  I love the theme and am always happy to see games tackle the bureaucratic dimension to politics and war.  The gameplay is smooth where it counts, but the myriad phases and algorithms can be a little overwhelming.  I hope that part gets easier with repeated plays.  

So, in general, the game has my attention.  We'll see if it can keep it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A controversial game, and one that I want to dive into before making up my mind about it. No doubt this is not your average historical sim, spanning instead many different genres. The game resembles a continuous tug-of-war between 3 people that want to move a boat in the same direction, but want each to captain it at the same time. There are many interesting things, the turn order and the way it intertwines with the advancing/debating mechanism, the asymmetry of the 3 factions, the push-pull of the junior partner based on the incentives of the others . Placed in an intriguing historical backdrop, this is primarily a negotiation game. It is also a long and fragile one, and makes no excuses for it. Whether it is well-balanced and as deep as Mark Herman suggests in his strategy articles, and eventually worth the time investment, only time will tell. For the moment, things are looking good. Don't buy it for the solo version though, until someone comes up with a proper context-aware AI app. Recommended.

+ Unique theme, and very pertinent to a negotiation game
+ The turn order and advancing/debating mechanism are very well done
+ Working actively to improve the position of the junior partner is a cool novelty
+ The rules are simple (but awkwardly phrased) and easy to get back into
+ Despite other opinions I have read, the decision space is not trivial at all
= It is a long game, even wth the tournament scenario
= The game requires repeat plays to see the nuances and parse the board situation
= It is a fragile game, it requires all 3 players to be of equal experience and ability
= The victory conditions are a steering tool rather than an evaluation, and should be viewed as such
= The luck of the draw/roll is not a concern for me, since the triad self-balances
- The game was too expensive for its components
- The rules should have been better written

After a browse on the GMT site, I thought this was going to be too abstract and of little interest.  It turned up on Thirsty Meeples retail shelves. A GMT game in a euro store gets my attention  and I bought it straight away.

This is a great point of view game.  It puts you at the peace conference held betweem 1943 & 1945.  The focus is the interation between the big three conducting the war effort and preparing themselves for the post war balence of power.

The war itself is abstacted but this is appropriate.  The big three had become more hands off by 1943 and were setting the agenda not dirrecting the forces in the field.  The very act of removing control from the players makes the game feel more real.

This semi co-operative game plays well over the longer scenario.  This gives beginers like me enough time to mess about but to still win the war.  We failed to win the war three time when we played the shorter scenario, you cannot afford a single slip up.  I'm sure this is the source for the nay sayers on this game.

The rules are fairly straight forward and after watching a couple of videos I was confident that this was playable.  Mastery is clearly another matter but the mechanics are teachable in a short evening.

By chance this ended up in my collection and a friend Tom showed interest in it straight away.  This became the only game we played face to face for a whole month (three of us meet up once a week at the Thirsty Meeple) this has never happened before.

This may not just be a my game of the year but also looks like a contender for my game of the decade.

This has changed momentum on the game table.  We have now scheduled Fire in the Lake for the next two weeks after a rules learning session.  My gaming world has just taken a heavy and historical turn for the first time in the last 20 years. Viva Herman and viva GMT.

Interesting game. While it felt a big long at times, it was interesting to see how the war unfolded. I did not like the way the board was set up. I felt it should be more like sitting around a conference table. Since most of the game action takes place during the conferences that should be the center. The placement of them map gets in the way.

I found some parts of this game to be very interesting, but the amount of rules and subtleties are hard to master. Unfortunately once I did, I found very few choices to make. I mean, your leader will dictate your strategy, your cards the issues you can discuss, the board where you should fight, etc. The only item that I found should deviate me from my strategy is where I was in VPs. But then again unless you're scoring after each conference, you don't really know where you are. There's also too much dice rolling for my personal taste. In conclusion, the game could have been much better.

Arrived!

This game is, without question, my most anticipated game in many years. Like another BGG member has said, I can be described as "quite obsessed with this game". After three completed games, several thorough readings through the rules, and reading every AAR and comments about the released version this game is a solid 8 ... possibly going to a rate a 9 at the end of the day. Excellent game with a dynamic back-and-forth gameplay that I find exciting.

This game offers paths to victory for all players, and more importantly a deep, rich and tantalising strategic gameplay created through remarkably simple mechanics that can not be fully understood by playing the game only once or twice. I have finished five complete games now and have only started to glimpse how amazing, deep and wonderful this title is.

I was also allowed the opportunity to create the official Vassal module for the game.

---------------------

There is, unfortunately, a false [b]and many-times refuted[/b] suggestion by one commenter that the game is broken, and this is patently untrue and stunningly unfair to Mark Herman and this game. It's a shrill and immature attempt to ignore facts by that singular commenter who steadfastly refuses to change their viewpoint based on demonstrated truths they obviously don't like. And when you can't respond to facts, starting a second or third thread beating the same dead horse does nothing to bolster your claims ... in fact, it makes you look even more ridiculous. In the end, you can have your own opinions, certainly, but you can't have your own facts. This game is [i]not[/i] broken, any more than Agricola is broken.

Bought this on a lark. Don't disappoint me Herman.

Update: A couple plays in. Eh, it's ok. Beyond the thematic disconnect of the VP system and the actual accomplishments on the board, I'm just not finding the game to be all that engaging. You debate some issues, you plop some production on the fronts, roll the d10, and hope for the best.

To be fair, there's a bit more to it than that, as you have to carefully select which issues are important to you and weigh that against the strength of your hand. Still, it ain't much, not for me anyway.

Overall, it's not bad, but it definitely feels like a eurogame as designed by a wargamer, a similar experience I had with [i]Pax Romana[/i]. Anyway, this is a game I would play if someone else wants to play, but probably won't suggest again myself.

Played the full scenario, really enjoyed it until the end and we started doing up the scores. Really annoyed with the scoring - just did not make sense. 
Read Mark Herman's blog to try and understand it and it made a lot sense. Would love to try it again now that I understand it better but the scoring at the end put off some in my group so may be difficult to get to the table. 
A long game, so you really need to understand the reasoning behind it before making the commitment.

Engages extremely well with the theme and is innovative and fun to play.

I am not completely convinced about the somewhat obtuse victory conditions - particularly the 2nd place wins if there is a spread of 15 VP between 1st and 3rd. It feels a little contrived/gamey and designed to create game balance - I would prefer it if the incentive for the W.Allies to assist the Soviets, emerged from historic realities reflected in the game rather than VP balancing. 

Also, with fairly large VP swings being possible based on losing just one Global issue, trying to finesse greater than a 5VP margin over 2nd place but less than a 15 VP margin over 3rd, may render the end game a bit of a lottery.

On the other hand these could be unfounded suspicions and the victory conditions could be genius - time will tell. 
The first play was enough fun to be keen to play again to find out.

Second play update - perhaps a little too much luck inherent in the system for such a long game. Rolling well for a breakthrough is big and rolling badly for an odds-on victory can be bad, especially for the USSR. A bit like 'No Retreat' not enough dice get rolled for the evening out effect of the luck of the dice. Losing Roosevelt early is bad for the US as Truman is flawed and a lot of US cards are powered by Roosevelt.

The game really relies on experienced players to achieve balance (Churchill is favoured without US & USSR correction).

I'm intrigued by this game after 1 play.  Easily my most interesting play of a recent gaming convention.  But I can't rate it any higher until I understand the rules better.  The moving around of issue markers is pretty fun.  The scoring is crazy/strange.  I can't quite decipher the method to the madness yet.  But I think, after reading the rules myself, things could click and it would be amazing.  I have a feeling this rating will go up with my next play.

Intriguing take on the various conferences between the Big Three, during and post World War II.  Players play through ten conferences, which involve card play ("debate") and resolution.  The outcomes directly influence the prosecution of the highly abstracted World War II game.  

I enjoyed the game mechanics and the narrative, but I'm less enthused by the plethora of victory points available, and whether one player can beat off two players who jump in bed together.  Great attempt, and easy to see why gamers are getting starry eyed over this one.  Time will tell.

As a veteran teacher and WW II aficionado whose always been fascinated with the history of the second world war I purchased a copy of the game to see if it at least captured the "feel" of the wartime conferences.

I enjoyed the experience so much I decided to try using it in my WW II elective for a few days. After introducing the game's mechanics and having an outside military expert present a mini-lecture on the diplomatic history of the principal wartime meetings/points of contention, I had my students role play the major participants for 3-4 days and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The students were fully engaged the entire time, with the Stalin player angrily demanding his Second Front, the U.S. obsessively pursuing its bomb, and a weakened but still wily Churchill bluffing, bullying and manipulating his rivals into using their more powerful resources to advance/preserve the interests of the British Empire. Afterwards, the students did extremely well on the wartime diplomacy assessment and repeatedly asked if they could ever do something like this again.

Don't let the length of the rules and multiple turn steps intimidate you. After watching a couple tutorial videos, and working through a practice turn or two, the game proved surprisingly simple to learn, game play became intuitive, and the historical suspense was somehow magically recreated--leaving you with that overwhelming desire to play "just one more turn" to see if your side finally achieved the decisive diplomatic advantage over its rivals

Good fun watching the western allies argue over second front issue whilst i claimed all the resources for the eastern front.

Leave it to Mark Herman to come up with a completely new design for a wargame.  Churchill is excellent, but I wonder how much it will hold up under repeated play.

RATING: 9
[-]Provisional rating on solo with bots.  Very neat concept and mechanically simplified, but requires a basic understanding of what's being abstracted (otherwise you're just moving counters around and it will seem themeless).[/-]

This game is just something magical.  Regardless of what's going on in the war, the ultimate race between the three players is a careful balancing act of VPs.  Win too many agendas or advance too far towards the Axis powers and you'll find yourself overshooting everyone, guaranteeing your loss.  Falling behind?  Drag your feet even more and upset the balance to give you a leg up when you make your move.  Someone getting too far ahead?  Steal all of their production and force them to make difficult decisions during the meeting.  Too far ahead?  Spend your resources to help the lagging player (whether he likes it or not) succeed in nabbing some more points.

Keeping score is optional in this game, but I can't see any reason not to do it.  The tension is so high when you know you are just a couple points away from winning or losing, despite you technically being in first place.  It all plays so well into the theme in that though all players do not share victory, they must still act as allies and not work too hard at destroying each other.  Everyone has their own personal agenda on top of the shared goal of ending and winning the war.

A game of this scope requires some abstraction, but the history is definitely there and it doesn't drown itself in minutiae.  Churchill is a streamlined ruleset and relatively-simple mechanics drive the action.  In the first half of a round, the three players meet and "discuss" the issues they want to, hoping to advance them toward their own chair.  After all is said and done, the second part is simply resolving everything that was decided in the meeting.  It really needs to be played to see how wonderfully this works out.

I don't see this game falling into many peoples' hands since it is such a specific and deliberate effort to capture the political atmosphere of WW2 among the Big Three.  Maybe i'm not creative enough, but it doesn't seem like this is a system easily ported to something else unless, perhaps, it is adapted for a pure fantasy/sci-fi setting.  Such as it is, this might be the only chance for people to experience a political simulation of this nature and Mark Herman does not disappoint.  Even if you don't want to put this one in your library, you should really at least sit down and give it a whirl (tourney scenario or higher; you will accomplish nothing in the training scenario) just to experience some true innovation and clever design.

2015-09-19 : Mark Herman knocked it out of the park with this low complexity, high chrome wargame specifically designed for 3 players. So that's the way we played it - the full campaign took us 6 hours. 6 Hours which flew by as you're thoroughly engaged all the time because you have to make small but meaningful decisions all the time, which is great because the occasional screw-up won't ruin your game but is important enough for you to curse under your breath. And that's exactly the level I want them to be. Did I mention the chrome yet ? If you're a WWII buff, this is your strategic level game.
2017-05-26 : A weeknight, so the 5-turn scenario got played and if the last A-Bomb die roll with a 87% chance had succeeded it would have ended in a tie with the third player 1 point behind. But it didn't and Uncle Joe won again :) Well balanced 3-player game that works perfectly within historical parameters, that's what it says on the box and that's what it does.

RATING: 3
I didn't really keep in my head the three ending conditions and how it affects end of game VP. In fact, I had a hard time keeping the rules in my head, in general. I do much better when reading the rules on my own, than learning from others. So, take my rating with a grain of salt. It simply reflects my desire to play the game again. Even without a firm grasp of the rules, I could understand the flow of the game and it wasn't for me. With the exception of Twilight Struggle, war games aren't really for me. Sorry Churchill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The victory conditions out of the box are ridiculous. Broken! For that, the game deserves a 1 rating. But I think just implementing a Republic of Rome-type house rule would go some way to creating a fun game, i.e., everyone loses if the Axis are not defeated. May be worthwhile to play again with this fix. Or maybe not.

RATING: 5
1) Doesn't play well via Vassal / Online, if for no other reason than the debates.  This is a face-to-face real-time game.

2) I don't like having to constantly monitor how well the other players are doing.  I especially dislike having to constantly monitor how the weakest player is handling things and help him out, just so I don't get too far ahead of the worst player and throw it to second player.  It's a subtle 'handicap the leader so everyone has a shot at a win' mechanic.  The balance is artificial and forced by the victory conditions, which can cause very random wins/losses.

3) It rather overstays its welcome.  There isn't a lot of diversity in the issues, so you're fighting the same fights over and over again and it takes a while to do so.  I LOVE long games, but I want more interesting decisions.  The struggle over the issues feels like 3 Player Duel.  I will not be at all surprised if the folks who love it now are completely burnt out on it in a couple of months.

4) I don't like the fact that you can effectively ignore the war and win.  On the opposite end, you can pay attention to it and still get seriously shafted by bad rolls.

5) You have to keep yourself within 15 points of the worst player to potentially keep the player in the second slot from gaining the win, but that isn't a very wide margin.  Even if you accomplish it and the second place player rolls well on an important front and you have a bad roll or two, despite all your hard work and heavy lifting of the weakest player, player two might well win anyway.  You work all game long to stay ahead, possibly could have had a blow out victory if not for having to keep some other player afloat, and then lose at the very end due to some bad debate draws or a bad die roll or two? That sucks.

6) It's rather pricey for what you get.  Of course, this is becoming a general problem in the hobby.

It's an interesting and innovative design by a very creative and highly regarded game designer.  I really enjoyed Washington's War, Fire in the Lake, and For the People.  I am fascinated by Empire of the Sun, though I haven't played it yet.  All of that aside, I find Churchill an interesting idea, but ultimately frustrating and rather boring.

RATING: 10
I've played three games of this in the past three days. We started with the training scenario, then went straight into the full game, then the tournament game. Firstly, the full game is not long at all. We completed it in 3 hours 15 minutes, which for a wargame is dead on average. It also didn't feel that long, as there were interesting decisions to be made at all times and we were all engaged. I think the reason that the game length has been elongated in other estimates is likely because people are reworking scores from scratch each conference. I don't think this is necessary. If the score is important, then keep track of changes, rather than recalculate them from scratch. The way I play is to only work out the score at the end. I may change this to checking scores every three or four conferences.

I love this game. It's got a simple core mechanism, but any decision made means there are other interesting decisions to make on the game map. I've played the game with both experienced wargamers and with people without much experience in board games, let alone wargames. The game ran smoothly with everybody. So far as I can see, the only requirement is an interest in WW2 and a small amount of knowledge about what your play leader wanted from the situation.

I would recommend this game to anybody, and will be taking it to my more casual gaming group this week to give it a try with them.

RATING: 5
Thematically, this is in my wheelhouse as my undergrad focus was on the Cold War but after one partial play, I'm not sure I'm motivated to revisit.

Seems to me the game is about playing cards for several hours to set yourself up for the convoluted endgame scoring. Do you want to push the resolution of the war -- and can you convince at least one other person to help you -- or do you stonewall and position yourself for the full negative, half negative, or positive DRM at the end of the game? 

You spend hours playing cards in a push-pull fashion trying to answer those questions. All in all, I'm not sure what people are excited about. Neither the conferences nor the war board seem all that interesting, they just seem to be perfunctory steps to the exciting conclusion -- which would be fine except it's 4-6 hours of repetition to get there. Seems to me the "game" is not in the card play (which is pretty simple after all) but in the negotiation required. Who can convince whom to tilt the game the way they want? 

My gut says this may be interesting but not interesting enough to play for a long afternoon just to get to the endgame. Not when Triumph & Tragedy or Maria beckon as a 3P game to spend a day playing. If it happens again, I'll give it go, but if not, that's fine too.

Probably should not be considered a wargame but I love this cooperative/competitive title.  Tough to be the Soviet player the first few times out, but the American learns to work with you else the Prime Minister always wins.  Then it becomes a really tight game!  I'm very taken with this design approach and can never get tired playing it!

Play 10-turn game once,
and saw other people play twice.

Really don't like the victory judgement system.
I could even find an historically reasonable explanation
for the 2nd high score player victory,
and could accept the failed advance because of dice roll.
But a dice roll to modify VP after a 6 hour,
10-turn game? Just couldn't accept it.

When there is huge VP difference between 2nd and 3rd
(in fact, usually happens),
the game just loose the tense.
1st may want to help 3rd to avoid the 2nd victory,
2nd seems should score some to become 1st...
but wait, he may lose the game if he really become 1st!
In this case,
most time 1st don't want to score and 2nd may score a little.
They build position and "wait" 3rd to catch up the VP.
This shouldn't happen in a well designed,
high tense game.

Some games are not so good,
but sometimes I am still willing to play them.
Churchill is not so bad, but I don't want to try it again.
I think some people would enjoy Churchill,
but just not fit me.

A very innovative game that I enjoy. However, it suffers from the same maladies as other 3 player games. Misplayed cards during the meeting segment can not only not benefit the player that played the card but can also screw another player. Potentially one player can repetitively screw another player either inadvertently or on purpose, thereby playing Kingmaker. In order to have a good game you need 3 high quality players that know the game and understand the card play.

I've got 2 plays of the tournament scenario.  Neither time did we defeat both Axis powers.  It seems we are having a hard time getting our heads around the cooperative portion.  Its a mind set we are having trouble achieving after a lifetime of playing a game where you are looking out for #1.


Winner of 2015 GG Wargame?!?! what the heck, It's NOT a wargame. Even the description by the designer says NOT a wargame.  Why was it even in that category?  If a wargame then I could argue that Agricola is a train game.

There is never enough production to do everything needed, and then jostle with your opponents for control of the markers.  Use these to defeat the Axis powers and ensure you are in the lead at the end (although not too far).

Clearly a very unique system. I really liked the negotiation aspect of the game, but less so the 'wheat for wood' aspect of the abstract war. I'm sure with more familiarity of the rules and a couple more plays I'd like it better, but as of now it's a 'meh'.

RATING: 7.8
I have read the rules and I have to say that this game looks very promising. I still have to understand all the implications and the nuances introduced by the checks-and-balances of the design, yet I can see this is something I'd love to play! 

In particular victory conditions seem very interesting. You have to cooperate on the destruction of the Axis, while competing to create a post-war world shaped in your own personal vision. Those that aggressively pursue points may be cut off from that post-war vision. 

One concern, though, goes to the pricetag which is in my opinion very steep. Pre-order as a final price could have been more acceptable. 

UPDATE
I've been playing this a lot lately. There are some easily missed rules and the player aids aren't really up for the task, the same can be said for the bots who look like they could have been developed a little further. 

As for the game an overall shape is forming in my mind, I have yet to decide if I like it thus far. 

UPDATE
Played this again and found it very good and engaging. So, once the rules have been taken care of with at least one player who knows the ins and outs then the game flow is seamless. New players introduced loved the game but I can't wait to play this with veteran players, since I believe this is a very tricky and fascinating game to play if all players know what they are doing. All in all this is a keeper! :)

UPDATE
Played this again and it was a much more enjoyable experience than expected, yet again this is pretty long and the enjoyment is not stellar. Still on the fence with this one.

Enjoyed this a lot. The rules are pretty straightforward, but it does take some time to wrap your head around the general logic of the game. However, once you get into it it's an original and very rewarding experience.  

The game provides a grand perspective on the late WWII and the politics that laid the foundation for the Cold War. Several mechanics are wonderful and very elegantly captures both the "issues haggling" of the conferences and the actual campaigning (albeit on a very abstract level).

A few drawbacks keep me from giving this a higher score though: the rules are not as clearly written as they could have been, which initially makes them feel more dense and complex than they actually are. The example of play part is written in a pretty funny "in-person" style which is entertaining, but kind of gets in the way of actually explaining how the game plays. This will of course not be an issue once you're familiar with the rules but for a new player it's a bit annoying. 

The gameplay can get a bit bogged down in a "step-by-step"/checklist feeling as you're performing all these tiny steps and distribute components back and forth in a rather repetitive manner. Also, the transition between the two distinct parts of the game (conference and war) isn't as smooth as it could have been. 

But overall it's a very good game.

A lovely simple card play mechanism is used to draft actions. You implement the actions you acquired, each action is pretty simple, and then those feed into this massive, complex, impressive VP machine. The first two steps are simple, but valuing what you're doing in them is so, so difficult. It is either impenetrable, or amazing. I don't know which yet.

Interesting. We need more political games. Played the full campaign twice so far.
Quibbles, but just quibbles:
0. Combat should have been unified so that it is always additive rather than "to-hit" when under 10 and additive when over 10. This would also permit omitting the 10-sided die. 
1. Stalin shouldn't be able to advance A-Bomb research or take it away from the US. It should be a US-only player action if he decides to burn production on it. USSR can continue to spy of course.
2. Pol.-Mil. markers should not be fought over. Those should be player actions at their discretion. That would simplify the conferences and you wouldn't need so many staff members. For example, Frances Perkins never went to any Big Three conference, but she does in the game.
3. All countries and colonies have the same value, but shouldn't, say, France, be worth a lot more than, say, Laos/Cambodia?
4. The Pol.-Mil. table should be rearranged so that countries that appear twice have their entries grouped together.
5. I wish the map had been turned 90 degrees so that the US player could read it more easily.
6. Should have included a sticker for Truman as well.
7. Should have had Wallace in the game.
8. Would like to see more variance and alternate history in the conference cards. If you compare them the variant versions are quite similar to one another.
9. Move Czechoslovakia so that it's east of Germany.
However, it's a very clean, elegant and pleasurable system to experience.

The designer has attempted something so totally original here that this is a game that defies easy characterisation. It's sort of a semi-coop, but sort of isn't as failing to conclude the war simply changes the victory conditions with no other consequences. Its basic mechanism resembles nothing more than the children's card game 'War', you simply play a card hoping to use a higher value than your opponents. There are problems here, luck of the draw in which Staff Cards you get (and the luck is exacerbated by the constant re-shuffling), OK most card-driven games suffer this, but winning a conference is huge. You get not just instant VPs, but the resources to prosecute the war in whatever way suits your needs. In fairness this is an interesting game, but I'm not surprised that the designer has felt the need to write extensive strategy articles telling us how to 'play it right', this game is incredibly sensitive to sub-optimal play. It's perfectly possible for you to play optimally and still lose if the second player is inadvertently throwing the game to the third. Ultimately, it doesn't work for me (even though the equally slender Twilight Struggle, at least to some extent, does) possibly because the cards represent dreary staff officers and bureaucrats, there's no exciting 'hook' to draw me into the theme. If you're still on the fence about this one then the question to ask is: Will I play this often enough with the same people for us all to become experts? If not, this is just a chaotic luck-based game.

After 4 face to face games and a half dozen solo games my conclusion is that this is a decent three player game.  However, the promise of bots, allowing the game to be played solo is what sold me on the design.

However, the "bots" in this game do not operate under well structured rules, such as in the COIN series, but by a set of guidelines for how to play them.

I would give the 3 player game a rating of 8, but the solo experience a generous 6.

Also, the rulebook is very badly laid out.  It is difficult to find specific items.  I think the intent was to have a kind of overview up frot and then more detailed rules in the back, but it reminds me of old Squad Leader where the programmed teaching style made finding anything a long drawn out process.

This is both a great game and great history.  While we war gamers love to get lost in minutia like armor thickness and projectile speed when you really think about it these three heads of state decided the fate of the modern world.  Churchill elegantly captures the highest of high level stakes in an easy to learn and, most importantly, fun to play package.  Much like Twilight Struggle this game will appeal to war gamers and Euro players. The world really needs a great 3 player game and this is the best I've played.

An innovative scoring mechanism prevents the usual "take down the leader" problem in multi player games.

Interesting game, which in spite of a huge rulebook is actually super easy to learn. The character cards are really cool and thematic, as are the events and all of the various scoring opportunities. At first it bothered me how the person with the second most points will win if there's too big of a gap between first and third, but the more I think about it the more I like that. It makes the people doing well have to help the people lagging behind just enough to make sure everyone does reasonably well while still trying to put themselves in the best position. This puts you into the appropriate headspace for a game of political alliances while still being controllable by the players.

I do have a couple problems though. Maybe it's my euro background but I felt like there were too many things determined by a die roll. Inexplicably sometimes after the scores are tallied up you each roll a die and either add or subtract the result from your score and then determine the winner. I have no idea what the thinking is for this. And in the same vein the biggest problem for me is how the fronts advance based on a die roll. Since you're only rolling a single die each time there's way too much variability, where you can hit the 20% chance to not advance a track you worked hard on while an opponent can get the 20% chance to advance something that they shouldn't have been able to. And I get that this is realistic but it also makes this fairly long strategic game that much less strategic. There are a lot of ways to add realism to a game that take away from the quality for me, and I'd rather have a better but slightly less realistic game than this.

I’ve been waiting to rate Churchill and provide comments until I had played the game a number of times.  Churchill is a 10, and if I could rate it a 20, I would!!!  This is a very innovative and entertaining game, an exposition in game format on the workings of government, and a history lesson all rolled into one.  I am retired from more than 30 years of federal civil service in the Executive Branch, with another 10 years of full-time consulting with Executive Branch agencies beyond that, and occasional part-time consulting continuing to the present.  I am a policy wonk and a government junkie, and I have enjoyed every day of my career in government service.  I have been a wargamer even longer, first playing the old Avalon Hill U-Boat in 1960 followed quickly by Tactics II, Gettysburg, and Dispatcher.  Churchill is the game I have been hoping for all these decades, and here it is, government simulated at the highest levels, linked to World War II, and setting the stage for the Cold War that followed, to be savored and enjoyed with like-minded friends, what could be better!  The Rating system says that a 10 is – “Outstanding. Always want to play, expect this will never change.”  Churchill is most definitely a 10, is now my all-time favorite game moving Paths of Glory down a notch, and is on the top of my desert island pile!

RATING: 8
Second play was much more satisfying than the first, which we played like a points-grabbing Euro with a lot of fighting over pol-mil and global issues, and no idea of how we might collaborate to win the war.

This is a unique game, at least until Mark H produces others using the same core mechanisms. The gameplay is tense and fun, with success at the conference table being critical.

While it's not too complex once you've got your head around it, there are about 73 different ways of scoring points, and multiple ways of determining who wins depending on how the game ends. Because of this, I suspect players have a choice: 

1. Keep track of everyone's points and watch it bog down into an analysis-paralysis nightmare
2. Just play on feel, make your best moves and see who wins at the end

If the players are really up to speed with the gameplay and victory nuances you may be able to make 1. above work, otherwise I'd recommend the second approach.

Rating based on around 5 plays thus far.  Very innovative, and the fact that the designer's wife is featured in the video was a big plus for me in being interested in the game.  I'm generally not into those monster wargames where you push alot of counters around, and this theme -- featuring the "Big Three" conferences is intriguing.  Very well thought-out design with some innovative features, in particular the unique victory conditions with which one needs to be familiar with in order to play well.

A remarkable achievement. A "political simulation" that eludes easy classification, as it is neither a war game nor a Euro but has obvious elements of both, but fully satisfying despite--or perhaps because of--this. It is, however, much more complex, both mechanically and decision weight wise than the bizarre "2" GMT complexity rating would suggest.

An involving theme for a good game far away from Twilight Struggle strategic level. You can not control anything if the other two players (don't matter which role they are playing) play together against the third one, unless you are very lucky with cards drown in a particular moment, and even so, if two agree two ruin the third player's game, they achieve it very easely.

After some plays I can say that (IMHO) Churchill isn't a wargame, nor a sim or a very good game. At the moment I can't sell/gave it because it was a present... It's not that bad, but simply it isn't my kind of game. 
For a three players game we always prefer any Pax game (from Ecklund).

I've only played this solo. The bots operate OK, but are not particularly competitive. The game is steeped in the flavor of WWII history, with all the personages that sit at, and then leave the negotiating table. The game works well on many levels, but I've got to explore some of the bot alternatives that have been devised and made available here on BGG.

I am not sure what to think about Churchill. On one side it is one of finest three player games I have ever played. It is tense, dramatic, with lot of options.

On other side I have hard time seeing WW2 behind actions happening in game.

It is hard for me to stomach that in case USA is too much in lead they may not be willing to crush Japanese. Also I have hard time seeing USA allying with Russia against UK.

There are too many of these weird things related to scoring that I have hard time enjoying end game and thus even willing to play game again.

So I love most of game up to end of war where strange things start to happen. 

I hope that team play of Pericles will fix these things.

First play, and sadly I had to bug out before we got to the finish.  But I was doing well!  For a first play, I felt the game was opaque at the beginning, but over the first half of the game, it gradually revealed itself to me.

I had to leave after 4.5 hours.  I guess we may have spend as much as 1 hour explaining the rules to me.  We were close to the end, and I encouraged the other players to continue, using a bot for me.  I hope that worked out.

I'd play again.  But I will now know to allot more time to the game.  

Impressions:  The political battles are the core of the game.  This is a tug-of-war mechanism, complicated by there being three corners to pull towards.  I would not find this interesting, except that there are multiple issues that can be at stake.  So you have to decide what is important, and what to let go.

The military campaign is a foregone conclusion.  The Allies will win.  But who will get the most out of the campaigns is unclear - so this part of the game has meaning.

The covert activities/political alliance markers appear to be significant.  Since I missed the conclusion of the game, I will have to ask my fellow players how this panned out.

The biggest problem I had as a first time player was processing what was going on.  I doubt anyone can understand this game well enough to be functioning at a high level on their first play.  Going forward, I see having equal-experienced players will be an issue.  During our game, I had trouble understanding who might be leading.  We had neglected the score track for some reason.  As I leftthey updated it, showing I had a lead.  But lots of points were unscored, and some points do not score until game end.  So knowing who is winning may be an issue.  This is important, as you are constantly quibbling with your allies.  You need to understand who might be the one you need to curb most urgently.

All in all, a strong first impression.  I will look forward to another chance at this game.

2nd Play - this time the shorter "tournament" game.  I came into this play much more familiar with the overall play of the game.  I didn't enjoy this game quite as much.  The actual play is some fun.  But the random rolling of dice to determine the winner at the end was not to my taste.

I played this once at ConsimWorld Expo, and it's everything I hoped it would be. The mechanics flow smoothly, the bidding for influence can be cut-throat, the negotiations tricky (sometimes 3-way cooperation, sometimes with one of the others to cut the third out). Your war efforts are represented nicely with the armies on the board.

This game will be perfect for my 3-player gaming group. I am looking forward to this game more than I ever have any of the many other games that I have pre-ordered over the years.

I really love the concept, but I'm taking this off my wishlist after one play of a playtest copy at BGG.CON.  I don't remember the details, but there were a few abstractions which bugged me--the way the once-per-conference leader abilities worked, or the way the VP schedule worked, or the main advancing-issues gameplay worked--it just felt gamey to me, by which I mean I didn't feel like the plans & decisions I was making in the game mapped very well to those of the historical participants.

(More traditional CDGs give me this feeling too, so if you like those, you will probably like this a lot more than I did.)

MOVED FROM 8 -> 9 RATING: 

Continued play continues to impress. This is becoming one of my favorite three player games. I really enjoy the full game with people who know the game as it can play fairly quickly but develop quite differently from the tournament game. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

We messed up the rules pretty badly in regards to the global issues powers on the board unfortunately. However, we got a fair bit of flavor of the game and really enjoyed the experience (well, except the USA kept going for my issues!). There is never enough resources to do everything. A five round tournament game still feels like a solid experience although I'd love to play a full campaign game at some point. Some of the wording on the cards is a bit confusing...Continued play and FAQs helped get the rules down a bit better. Still had some issues with scoring Japan in my most recent game until we looked at the FAQ.

Mark Herman design!  It's been quite some time to see new game design from this Hall of Fame designer.  Card-driven + cubes like Divided Republic, Twilight Struggle.  Abstract game of geopolitical struggle that shapes the modern world (and seeding its crisis).  The success of VPG State of Siege system echoes the popularity of the game here, whereas the players actually move everything along a track on the mapboard.    

As first time British player, and of the game, I was leading in VPs all the way through all the conferences as agenda setting nation. Final tally was 90-63-42, as I was just keeping to win the conferences and the global issue, spreading Empire's influences over the globe. I thought it was historical for the British. But the game victory condition is a self-correcting mechanism. I just couldn't find way to pull back the British momentum, which cast me doubt how was I going to spend the resources had I won the other issues. It is because the British really doesn't want to end the war with surrender of both Axis powers, not to mention the seeming sympathies with Germany thought to have been exhibited by Churchill during the conferences. In the end, Churchill lost the game to Stalin because of the 15 VPs spread rule in condition 2. Both Stalin and Roosevelt/ Truman concentrated their resources on British Front Track for a final British mandatory advance onto Japan from Formosa in the final turn. But in what sense Stalin was winning historically in that context? From my British perspective, well, at least I liberated Hong Kong by force which was not historically done by the colonial ruler. 

I do see the point of the balancing mechanism as Stalin and Roosevelt fought for the remaining VPs when the spread was exceeded too much. The mechanism also impacts the players psychologically during the game in a "commonwealth" spirit that they should "rebuild" hand in hand in the vision of post-war world. But my doubt remains. Despite my doubt, I do think Churchill is truly an innovative, narrative-strong design to simulate political struggle at grand strategic scale, which was not thought being possible before. That said, I am looking for the probability analysis from an AH-mathematician guy coming up with a table of the three victory conditions in accordance with the dice-rolling results. The beauty is then to prepare the situations on the board according to that maximum % of winning the game. 

Overall, Churchill set out what the designer expected to do and also fully met my expectation: a matrix of political options to make and to dig deep.  Although the game takes about six hours to complete, it is actually a medium light game gameplay-wise.  The rulebook, as written into two parts, seems to inflate the complexity of the game artificially.   I find Churchill as a game simulates quite efficiently in a very compact model. At the same time, the game lacks somewhat a fineness quality that Mark Herman is renowned for in his previous strategic level (Peloponnesian War, Pacific War) or tactical level (GBoH series) games. Churchill looks crude at times when people pushes the issue counters backward and forward on the conference map and there are nothing else to affect the outcome other than the Staff Card value. The gameplay feels mechanical with the card play and the military campaign resolution and there are not many options and subtleties inside to tinker with.

Clever idea - having the diplomatic situation on top of what amounts to a "State of Siege" mini-track game to create a multiplayer situation.  In the execution, there are colourful bits but it all seems very abstract and ultimately takes too long. The victory conditions are a mess; we just played and looked who won at the end.  

Could be a decent filler game if it took half the time.

I resisted Churchill when it was first published, but when the reprint came up for pre-order I gave in to temptation.

Learned the rules playing solo (Stalin vs the 'bots).  It flows well and seems pretty intuitive after a couple of turns.

Rating based on 3 players. Played the 5 conference scenario.

I'm not sure if I should even put in a rating for this because it was only in the second half of the game that I really started to understand what was going on (as much as I could not having read the rules, as there are a lot of rules/special cases--a bit too much for my liking, as it felt too chained to real history). Even then, I was not exactly sure what my end goals should be (the end scoring is rather strange/confusing, and I was unclear on how VPs were given).  However, I found the game interesting, I liked the debate mechanics (it reminded me a bit of The King is Dead), and I found I had a lot to think about afterward. 

This is definitely a game that would be easier to understand with repeated plays, though I think a full campaign would be too long for me.

3 / 5 - Good

There's a absolutely brilliant game in this box. But it requires a lot more time and effort to tease out than most gamers are willing to give it. The scoring rules, although not long, are incomprehensible at first and it takes several plays to understand how to win. And it needs three exactly to play and to play together repeatedly to get to grips with the strategy. If you want one game, for three, for years, get Churchill. If you want variety, don't.

After more plays: I enjoy playing the game (especially the campaign), but I find the endgame fiddly and unsatisfying.  I don't like having to track the score so carefully, and the victory conditions create an endgame calculus that removes me from the narrative and no longer feels like a consim. 

***
Not a wargame, but way more thematic than most Euros. More along the lines of a game like Virgin Queen. Strategy definitely will take a while. I do find that the complexity of the VP count is a bit tedious, but it does give the gamers a lot to think about.  I think the game really shines in the full campaign because there is a lot more cooperation and diplomacy.

7 - 01/11/2015 - I like the theme and loved its implementation: I really felt being Stalin and discussing against Roosvelt and Churchill (also because three members of my staff were sent to Siberia in my very first game). The rules are simple, but all the interaction arises from things happening on the board, and the victory point system is not consequential. I'll need to play at least another couple of games just to start understandings how it really works in the distance. Definitively all the players must be on the same experience with the game for a fair competition.

Churchill is in a class of game where playing with the same group of people fairly frequently will yield greater satisfaction with the game. All three players need to be playing seriously, and all need to be playing well for the maximum enjoyment.

08/08/15 Played the tournament scenario in three hours. 
I have no desire to ever play the whole ten turn, six hour affair. I'd rather not play this tournament scenario more than once a year. Plus I *never* want to play the Russians again, as their limited military options bored me. The game has some novel concepts. I liked the theme (more politics than war) and that it was made for three players. But there are just so many moving pieces it makes me weary after a couple of turns. The graphics and components are nice. But like most GMT games they feel they must throw everything and the kitchen sink into each design. That's why of the dozen or so GMT games I've played in the last 15 years most of them turn me off. I realize they have a small dedicated core audience that absolutely loves that; can't get enough detail or game length. But I think satisfying them alienates a much greater number of people. But that appears to be their business model; get 500-600 hard core wargamers to buy each release and phooey on everyone else.

+Interesting to have a diplomacy game where the diplomacy is based on your actions rather than table talk

-Solitaire system is weaker than weak. 20% into my first game I figured out how to beat Stalin. Everytime.
-Solitaire system is so weak that if you completely randomizes its actions it would perform better (for Stalin anyway).
-Scoring system is cumbersome and tedious.

-Poor manual makes the game harder than it is

This game has many new concepts, especially the victory conditions. It really clicks if the players play together to defeat the axis, sharing VPs, and jockey to be in the best position when the Axis fall. Being ahead in VPs, (think of them as domination points rather than VPs) does not mean you are winning. The card play during the conferences was much more interesting than I anticipated.

Have only played the training scenario (sans bots), but what a fresh, new design. Like most of Mark Herman's games, a real brain burner in terms of strategy. I believe that GMT has this rated a '2' in terms of complexity, which is too low, IMO. I would put it in the same area as some of the COIN games, maybe a '4'. Not really difficult from the high level, but this isn't Ticket to Ride. 

Although this is primarily a political game with the war abstracted, there is still a lot of history in the game. People who love history and historical games will love it, may be 'too much history' for those who love their euro abstracts. (Btw, I wouldn't have it any other way)

Quite an effort, quite different.  The push pull mechanism not as unique as others claim: Merlin has this aspect, made a couple decades earlier.

Good looking board, and interesting use of State of Siege tracks.  Final scoring a bit opaque.

Rules a bit hard to understand because this isn't like many games you have played.  Its a unique system with other elements of games that seem to blend together nicely.  A 3 player game isn't the norm, but works very well as players take the persona of Churchill, Stalin and FDR.   Each country has an agenda for the war and post peace, some agenda coincide some do not, so you may be allied with one entity or the other at various points in the game.  Board, Counters and Card usual GMT quality.  Game was engaging and second place player won as USA had built too big of a lead... unique victory conditions.  Not sure on long term replay, so giving it a 9.  I felt the Axis were a little too weak especially the Japanese navy.  With that said, it did take the US a while to really get rolling in the Pacific, more because of what her allies did and some bad die rolls.  Will play again very soon!

With people who'd played before and both owned the game it took 2 hours of rules before the first turn began. After another 5 hours we were ready to begin turn 7 out of 10. It seemed nobody wanted to continue.

The fact that USSR had barely made an effort to attack Germany while into Korea in the east, The US had the bomb, Iwo Jima, and was past Normandy by one territory, Britain had Hong Kong and central Italy.

I have so few days available for 7 hour games and this was nearly a total waste of a precious day.

The only thing keeping this from being a 10 is that player count, you HAVE to have three players. I've played this with 2 players and the bots, and it's just not the same. The bots are no substitute for a real person, they're good for solitaire exploration/learning, but little else.

Played a full 7 1/2 hour campaign game.  The U.K. got too far ahead in VPs with a Pol/Mil strategy and had a hard time dialing back. The U.K. lost the game to the U.S. who was in second place in points.  At first I thought the conference segment would be a boring matter of chit tug-of-war but I found it engaging and nuanced. It's interesting to see the results of each conference play out on the world map display. It can be hard to wrap your head around the victory conditions so a thorough understanding of them is essential to enjoying the game.

The first thing that jumps out about this game is how obtuse the scoring system is. It feels like something that requires you to have played the game all the way through a couple times in order to fully grasp, and then once you do you get a bit annoyed with it. It's easy to screw yourself over, especially in the shortest setup (which is likely what you'll try playing to begin with). That said, the debating in this game is amazing. The theme of the game helps keep the incredibly fiddly board play engaging, because players will mostly understand what is going on. This game is messy, but those debates sure are fun.

Very clever game design. The strategic World War 2 basic simulation itself is worth interest, while three players interaction and resource placement subsystems convey a lot more flavor through design for effect efficient mechanisms.
Victory conditions are also very clever for a competitive game with forced cooperation (to defeat the Axis).

Gran bel gioco. Necessariamente per tre giocatori e geniali le regole per determinare il vincitore che non è necessariamente chi ha più punti vittoria. Ogni turno, e la partita prevede 3 scenari differenti a seconda della lunghezza che si vuole provare, si suddivide in una fase 'conferenza' e una fase 'operativa'. La fase conferenza è originale e divertente e a mio avviso una simpatica idea. Gioco non banale e molto strategico ma rimane un american e il lancio del dado potrebbe far storcere il naso ai puristi german

Really impressed with this 3-player Twilight Struggle. The rules, setup, gameplay and scoring aren't simple but they aren't supposed to be: this is a deep, strategic war game for serious players. What I enjoyed most about Churchill was that it was very thematic; after playing, I understood the push-and-pull of post-WWII talks of the era. In the game's conferences, there was always more I wanted to accomplish and gain but the cost was my comrade's resources or, worse, my resources. And that's just the first half! The second half is the ongoing warfront itself: closing in on the Germans or getting closer to securing the surrender from Japan--which always meant points. Another fine aspect of the game was the emphasis on cooperation; there is a punishment for runaway winners in Churchill. If someone hoards all the glory and not focused on helping his teammates and their objectives, there are consequences. In the endgame, there are scenarios that don't reward selfish winners and prevent them from winning. Overall, my experience with Churchill was very unique, if a bit tedious and complicated. Still, I never noticed that it was suddenly dark outside! All I knew was that we were closing in on the Germans, which meant I better end my campaign in the Pacific. I was present and engaged for every moment! And this is definitely not my type of game. So kudos to the designers for making a well-crafted game of strategy and cooperation.

RATING: 8.5
A VERY unique game.  And that is my only complaint.  It takes so long to wrap your head around it that the simplicity of the game doesn't kick in until quite some time into your first play.  There is also a lot of time when I feel 'tracked' by the game...like I'm not really doing much and the game is playing me.  I still really like it, though.  Playing with three humans might change my mind about it a bit!

RATING: 9
I may not be the stingiest reviewer, but I try to be so with my 10 ratings. While the game has one or two elements I might quibble with, it is simply too innovative and different not to reward with my highest recommendation. After 10 plays of this game, I can see how tight and variable the outcome can be as far as who wins. The one thing I might observe is that in our plays of the full, ten-turn campaign game, the Axis seems to be defeated a bit early for my taste. Maybe that's because our group is simply getting better at the game? In any case, the shorter tournament version seems perfect for capturing the tension of the historical conflict in its endgame. A wonderful game that is evocative of what leadership the Big Three really had to display to bring the war to a successful close.

RATING: 8
A wholly original take on WW2 through a political rather than military lens. I was worried that (at this grand-grand-grand-strategic scale) the war might feel remote and abstracted, but the narrative that develops in play is consistently engaging and involving.

The focus on scoring isn't quite my play style, but I see how it adds interesting tension to a three-way race where pulling too far ahead will lead to post-war difficulties.

Mark Herman is an artist. How many game designers remain as innovative when they could easily have as much success just replicating earlier achievements?

I usually respect Chris Farrell's comments here since they are well thought out and articulated but based on my one play of Churchill, I completely disagree with his assessment of this game. Broken? It's a word that gets passed around here WAY too much but if you are going to claim that a game is broken, you had better be able to back it up with something other than "I might post something later". 

In my one play so far, I found it original and worthy of continued play. Perhaps I am not the sharpest tool in the shed but I suspect it will take me quite a while to figure out how it is "broken" (if it, indeed, is).

A "wargame" (political conflict game) made specifically for three players, in the spirit of COIN games. One player plays Stalin, one plays Churchill, and one plays FDR. Much bandying about of issues and troops ensue. 

The card play was fairly pedestrian, with the only differences between the different staff members largely being different bonuses based on the issue you were targeting. Bandying for the different issues was still pretty fun though. 

The pol/mil aspect of the game (pretty much Twilight Struggle-style bandying for support of different countries seemed sort of grafted on.

The military conflicts had a lot of rules to make them more historically accurate, which led to a lot of burying one's head in the rules every conflict phase to figure out where the German/Japanese troops all went. 

The scoring was pretty creative though, encouraging getting the highest score (coming out of WWII in the most favorable position of power) but not getting TOO high (appearing to shun the Alliance between the three).

My rating is a 6, in part because of my aversion to longer games. Also, being a GMT game, there is some inevitable fiddliness. I've played twice and haven't disliked either play, but the game has yet to 'click' with me. The concept of 'do well, but not too well' is counter-intuitive, and the opaqueness of the end game conditions/scoring make cooperation a math nightmare.

Only one play, and we did the learning game with five turns. It's was somewhat of a slow going as we were re-learning the rules as we went. That said, I had a lot of fun.

Don't get me wrong, Churchill is fantastic, but I am not finding it as engaging as Triumph & Tragedy.

The hardest part to master in this game is the scoring system. Even when you know the scoring rules by hart, it is difficult to twirl the twin dishes of playing so to favour your faction AND to keep track of how the other two are doing. "Winning but not by too much" is the winning strategy, here, and this sometimes means to concede points instead of grabbing them.

This game works well solo, and the "bots" do play reasonably well. However, two players is not the ideal number, because the key multiplayer aspect - negotiating - is crippled. If you are inclined to play a geo-strategic game, but you can't scrap a third player, then you should consider Twilight Struggle.

2-18-17: Had been patiently waiting for this game ever since I heard about it, which unfortunately was after the first printing was out of stock. Waited for p500 reprint, finally got it, and am very happy with it. Churchill is an excellent "game" about war but not a "wargame". Great three player game with excellent mechanics and a rich and deep narrative that emmerses you in the moments of history that positioned the victorious powers of WWII in the afterwar era. Not for for everyone, must have an interest in history, and this particular aspect of political teamwork yet opposition at the same time makes the game stand out for the  fact that the winner isn't always the one with the most points. Best with 3 players, but the a.i. bots can make it interesting as a solo or 2 player game. The aspect of negotiation and give and take is key to be succesfull at this game.

Would recommend this to any fan of history, particularly WWII, and any fans of political negotiation games.

Great game. It's tense and required cooperation between Allied players to defeat the Axis. But that's the rub--you never want to surrender an inch to your opponents at the conferences when you know it will cost you VPs in the end. Guaranteed to raise your blood pressure.

„Churchill“ ist ein von M. Herman entwickeltes, innovatives Strategiespiel für drei Personen, das sich um die großen Konferenzen der Alliierten während des Zweiten Weltkrieges, um ihre Auseinandersetzungen über die Kriegführung und die Nachkriegsordnung dreht. Jeder Spieler übernimmt einen der „großen Drei“ (Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin – jeder Protagonist kann auch von einer mitgelieferten „KI“ übernommen werden) und versucht mit Hilfe von sieben Politikern (sie werden durch Karten repräsentiert und zufällig gezogen), im ersten Teil jeder Spielrunde – der eigentlichen Konferenz – bestimmte Themen durchzusetzen, die von der Atombomben-Forschung über die Errichtung einer zweiten Front oder der Frage des offensiven Schwerpunktes bis zur Installation politisch genehmer Regime reichen. Die drei Staatschefs verfügen bei ihren Verhandlungen über individuelle Boni: So entscheidet Roosevelt bei allen Gleichständen, Churchill hat Vorteile bei der Erstellung der Tagesordnung und Stalin darf den anderen beiden während der Konferenzen am energischsten widersprechen. Für jede der bis zu zehn Konferenzen (die Spieldauer ist daher individuell einstellbar) gibt es drei unterschiedliche Versionen, die sozusagen die politische bzw. politisch mögliche Situation bei Konferenzbeginn vorgeben, was einen hohen Wiederspielwert garantiert. Im zweiten Teil der Runde werden die Konferenzergebnisse dann auf einer abstrahierten Weltkarte implementiert – was jedem Spieler nach und nach Siegpunkte verschafft und im Idealfall am Ende zur Kapitulation der Achsenmächte führt (aber durchaus nicht führen muss). Es gewinnt jedoch nicht unbedingt der Spieler mit den meisten Siegpunkten. Erreicht nämlich ein Spieler einen zu großen Punktevorsprung, ist davon auszugehen, dass sich die unterlegenen Parteien nach dem Krieg gegen ihn verbünden und einer friedlichen Koexistenz schaden werden. Also kommt es darauf an, zwar viele Punkte zu erreichen, andererseits aber die Mitstreiter im Kampf gegen Deutschland und Japan nicht zu übervorteilen. Mit Recht hat der Designer das Spiel daher als „a political conflict of cooperation and competition“ beschrieben.
Es mag abgedroschen klingen: das Spiel ist ein Meisterwerk - leicht zu erlernen, aber nur mit viel Köpfchen zu beherrschen. Jeder, der sich für die Diplomatie unter den Alliierten (und die Endphase des Zweiten Weltkrieges) interessiert, sollte zumindest einen Blick auf "Churchill" werfen.

--Revised rating to a 10. I'm now of the opinion that the victory conditions of the game are so paradigm breaking that it completely shifts the way a player must think about victory. The VCs were designed to prevent the need of a gang-up-on-the-leader situation to balance the game. But I'm now of the opinion that not only do they do that, but they essentially negate any sort of long-term collusion between two players to eliminate a third player from being a threat. Such a strategy does not seem viable. 

--Revised rating up a point to 8.5. Iv'e spent a lot of time thinking and discussing the game and what it represents in the historical context. That in itself is the mark of a great game. I've come to the conclusion that the victory conditions are utterly brilliant. I fear, though, that one play by inexperienced players may result with them concluding the game is broken because of the victory conditions. It is not. As written, the game brilliantly illustrates how and why the leaders of the Big 3 were pursuing their own national interests in WWII and why it was so important to still get Germany and Japan to surrender unconditionally.
------------------------------------
Very interesting game. The three different victory scenarios add a lot to the strategy of the game. It might actually make the Bots work better as the Bots not playing well actually makes it potentially harder to win the game. If a person played it purely as a game, however, it might be possible to consistently win by sabotaging the collapse of Germany/Japan and running away with Pol/Mil issues. 

2 things keep the game from getting a higher initial rating. 1) The narrative of the game seems thin. Maybe this would be improved in a multiplayer game. But I didn't really feel like I was debating an issue as much as moving a chit around a board. 2) I'm not sure, but it feels like a game where a optimum/dominant strategy could emerge after a few playings to where choices of issues to debate at a conference and the choice of card-play during the conference will become automatic and not present tough choices. It will take more games and multiplayer games to see if that's true.

--Aug2015-- This is quite cool:  sensibly streamlined mechanics plus interesting decisions (plus a rather odd scoring system) leaves something that's fascinating to play, and rather perplexing to "win."  I've really enjoyed the first couple outings; but we've yet to see anything resembling historical incentives, nor has the Axis yet fallen.
I rather expect the game is "intended" to be played more coöperatively than we're inclined.  And, to a great degree, we're probably delusional enough to try that, too.  But even if it's cool and enjoyable (and it is: my rating reflects that) it's also likely not a game that permits focussed competition without becoming deeply ahistorical.

Only played the intro game of 3 conferences. I think I'd like this more after playing the full game - in the shorter scenario, the victory conditions kind of rapidly swung out of control of the players, and of course you don't get the narrative of pushing through DDay and so on. Really interesting to play something simulating this level of command; brought to mind Wallace's "God's Playground" (3p competitive but working against common enemies).

I've only been able to play the game solitaire to this point, but I'm very taken with Churchill.  The mechanics are smooth and the gameplay clearly has some subtlety to it.  That said, what really elevates the game in my eyes is the uniqueness of the perspective and the clarity with which it focuses the player on their particular role.  You simply don't see many games that shift geopolitical issues to the forefront and let the military game exist more abstractly, and what makes that work is the fact that each player plays one of the heads of state and is focused on what feels like the proper set of decision points.

Very well done, and I'm looking forward to the Peloponnesian interpretation.

The issue with this game is that it requires three very ruthless and Machiavellian players, otherwise you'll either end up with a broken, dysfunctional alliance unable to achieve war aims, or one player will dominate the game. The VP conditions try to mitigate this by forcing players to avoid dominating the game too much, but there's a threshold where upon amassing enough VP crosses that threshold and allows that one dominating player to win. There is no real sense of urgency on the Eastern Front and the Pacific Theatre, where victory is preordained.

Also, it seems that this game promotes screwing over Stalin as much as possible for VP. In this game Churchill seems very powerful compared to Franklin Roosevelt, and especially compared to Stalin, but without exploring why Britain had so much influence over the course of the war, with their experience. For example, the US had wanted Operation Overlord to happen much sooner, but the British offered a smaller scale amphibious invasion called Operation Jubilee at Dieppe to expose just how underprepared the Western Allies were for such a massive undertaking.

The conference system and debating issues is fun and has a great deal of potential. Turning each card into a staff member with attributes is a good idea too. But the scoring system seems dry and prone to gamey outcomes. The amount of attention given to bots (player aids have 3 out of 4 pages dedicated to bots) seems inordinate. Only tried the Tournament Scenario in which it seems the Soviets will have a very hard time, while the Allies don't even have to win the war to win the game.

This game is the antithesis of elegance. So many tiny details and overhead. The design seems a bit over-sculpted. Lots of procedural script. Past this script, the main decision points seem to add up to a push your luck game of sorts with a touch of diplomacy, semi-cooperation, and a sometimes frustrating tug of war.  Maybe I just haven't had my "Aha!" moment with this one yet. 3 plays in and I am finally on top of most of the mechanics and rules, but strategy is still opaque (Or maybe too strategically scripted, and I didn't want to follow the script). Too much seems to hinge on die rolls.

Maybe there is a gem hiding in there, but the huge inhibition towards experiencing it is the large overhead leading to a requirement of heavily invested players. Even then, too many important details are left to dice and card draws. After one or two more plays I may get rid of this if the gem isn't revealed.

I am highly curious about the upcoming Perikles game in this new series, as Herman says it's more of a true war game. I will remain cautious however, given my current frustration with this one.

This is a very cool game with a LOT going on! There's a sort of "headline" phase where you commit a card for the chance to gain an advantage (at the cost of a good card!). Then players each add issues to the table, which are fought over in a 3-way tug of war. The conference table fight works very well and seems pretty balanced; each player has a unique advantage but in the end the results are generally pretty close. The choices made there then play out on the battle board. There's not much "battle", really -- it is definitely not a war game -- but you do get to roll dice throughout. 

It's a very enjoyable game, and I somehow managed to win. The problem, though, is that "somehow" -- after a 3 hour game I still don't have a good understanding of how that happened! How should you decide on which issues to bring to the table? Which fights are worth fighting? I was mostly looking at my cards to see which issues I would have more strength in (some cards are worth more towards specific topics) and then trying to play towards those advantages. Even so, I seemed to lose on "my" issues just as often as not! 

I think I might have a better understanding of how all the gears interact after repeated play. Unfortunately I'm just not sure that's likely!

Very unique game. The political tug-of-war over the political/military issues being debated is unlike any other game I've played before. 

The only thing holding it back is that it's hard for me to get 3-player games to the table. It also lasts 4 to 5 hours which is a significant amount of time, especially when you have young children. Not to mention the prep work required if you haven't played in a while. 

Still, it's a blast to play and my desire to play it is still high, even knowing that at this point it's a once-per-year thing.

Fun to play but awkward/weird/random victory conditions really detract from the game. Why does the USSR get 5 victory points if the two American fleets are not even in their rivalry (something they have no control over), but only get 8 for conquering Berlin before the Americans get there?

RATING: 8
Plenty of tension and strategy, plus lots of clever theming--so many historical aspects of World War II are slyly abstracted into simple mechanisms. Churchill makes you think differently about victory conditions, and in particular, what the historical personages were really competing for at any given time in the war--and while this concept is intriguing, it demands the kind of constant hyperfocus on the score that can make the proceedings bog down into mathematical min-maxing if you really want to ensure a win. I haven't played a game yet where those end conditions didn't feel a little arbitrary and a little uninspiring; the novel concept of "win, but not by too much" puts handcuffs on players, which for me results in something less than a satisfying play. The best way to think of Churchill might be as a truly competitive, tournament-style game demanding many plays to 'get right,' not a history sim you turn to for narrative.

RATING: 8
Having read the rules, Churchills history of Ww2 and Lord Allanbrookes diaries this is a must have. The squabbles over execution of the war and the jockeying for post war position are as interesting as the progress of the war itself. It was almost too much to expect a games diminishing of British influence at the conferences as per the history, however the rules framework is tremendously exciting as way of playing out the dynamics of this history. Number one on my wish list (April 2015)
------------------------------------------
Playing a solitaire campaign game to get the rules down. The mechanics are hugely entertaining. No idea yet what strategy to follow other than play to card strengths. 2 full rounds and learning a few tricks of the debates. God knows how it ties in to final victory though. Unsure of full campaign as early moves connection to final scoring a opaque and for the novice player maybe the impetus of five turns is more important. Although if the 10 turn game almost (according to designer) always ends in defeat of the axis it focus minds on 1 victory condition (though perhaps this diminishes the joy of juggling with three possible outcomes). Loving seeing Pug Ismay and Dudley Pound (perhaps when he is played one of the players should fall asleep at the table whilst everyone else goes off for a cup of tea) represented in the game.

[playtester, 2013] Still had some funky issues last time I checked. Not sure if this one is going to pull into the station.

[update, 2015] The game has been totally redesigned, and what a glorious production it is! GMT rates this a 2/9 complexity, I would say it's higher than that (some innovative and interesting concepts here) to learn.

There are some initial questions/errata, but it's very minor. Lots of interesting and tense decisions throughout play.

We've had several games come right down to a dice roll (Condition 3), and we really didn't mind - after all, the game is about putting yourself into a position of triumph and if you can't leverage your opponents while still defeating the Axis, then the winds of fate will intervene.

This game just keeps getting better with each play, and it has become a local favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very impressive and clever 'push me pull you' style game that abstracts the political struggle between the main allied leaders in WW2. 

The card driven conference mechanic works well, and the simulation of the war front(s) to drive / generate vp's is quick to resolve and creates tough choices for all the players.

End game victory evaluation is discrete and has a potential sting in the tail if one player has been too dominant.

Definitely one of the freshest, and most innovative, games from GMT, since the introduction of the COIN series.

I really do not understand the appeal of so many GMT games; spend an hour setting something up (let's say the Eastern Front for Stalin) and then the game randomly allocated 4 troops to your front and you roll badly. Your opponent places no support, gets lucky and no troops reinforce his front and he rolls "well" - and succeeds.

All this with an A4 reference sheet to deal with all of the thematic rule exceptions - that add nothing to the actual gameplay.

RATING: 4
Edit: more plays, and it I'm downgrading again, having played with knowledgeable and experienced opponents.  This game is just plain dull, no flavour whatsoever to the characters involved.  (speaking of the cards, my opponents were awesome!).  Each time I play I care less and less, no coordination at all to defeat the axis, because it just doesn't matter, no sense of the Big Picture is achieved.

Edit: a few more plays on the table, pulling my number down.  Introduced to a number of folks whom I thought would love this one, and it is decidedly a "middling" title.  All agree it's "interesting".  Ultimately it lacks tension, there is little incentive to work cooperatively at all, since it is easier to play "spoiler".  (Though table trash talk between leaders is always good sport). The game seems a long grind, and even our tournament plays had us covertly checking our watches waiting for it to end.

I am disappointed by the lack of "narrative".... post game For the People, Twilight Struggle or Fire in the Lake etc. I've always felt like a wonderful tapestry or story was woven by game play or card interaction, and I think that story never gets told in Churchill, and why it is a rather forgettable game.

Much like a wartime conference, Churchill will probably become a "compromise game", one that gets played because no one can agree on anything else to play, and everyone will be mildly disappointed they didn't get what they really came to the table to achieve.

And to the folks that give it 9 or 10 after a preorder or reading the rules, you aren't doing anyone any favours if you rate without playing...

An absolutely wonderful game that isn't as much about WW2 as it might first appear, at least not in the sense that most games about WW2 arrive at. Rather, it's a game about shaping the post-war world in your team's ideological image — capitalism, colonialism, communism — while walking the tightrope of ensuring your opponents don't team up and rob you of your hard-fought victory. The result is a bold statement on the personalities who determined the state of affairs of the twentieth century.

Also nice that it's so playable.

Fantastic game.   Perfectly balances the 2 vs 1 problem inherent in any 3 player design, because where usually the pairing is sub-optimal for *one* of the two players in it, in Churchill it can actually be detrimental to BOTH of the players.  Mechanics are extremely simple, but the analysis required to determine the best course of action is anything but.

Only played solitaire so far, but I'm really quite obsessed with it.  The Conference table play has a real Bridge/Poker feel to it that I've enjoyed, and the war aspects are full of tough decisions.

Another one in the "overall strategic politic" games. This interests me for the ability to run it solo with the bots or 2 or 3 players (and especially 3 players). I went for it finally for the very interesting design and the fact that it tackles the war from an angle that really gets me thinking. But man is this a beast of a game - definitely takes lots of time to get into. Rules could have been easier, too, as the structure makes it harder to learn than would be necessary.

Solid three-player game, with a focus on negotiations. The victory conditions take a while to absorb, and until then the game can appear unbalanced, but once everybody is on board it becomes much more competitive.

ingenious but I don't feel immersed in the narrative and the end-game feel broken by the special victory conditions (for example, finally I'll not assault Japan as USSR is too powerful and assulting Japan would only give them the victory => the Axis not surrendering is giving the US a chance to recover)

Great and unique game. I've taken to using the tournament scoring for Condition 2 and the whacky die roll for condition 3.

My players generally prefer it.

RATING: 7
Very tentative rating after one play of the introductory scenario, and this could go way up or down if I get a chance to play it again.  The three-way dynamics are very complex, and the victory conditions make it nigh-impossible to tell who is winning unless you've got some experience with the game.  

The cards could be a little bit more thematic or add a little more flavor to the game, as most of them are rather dry "+1 to this card's value if used when Mercury is in retrograde" kind of cards.  Certainly that is exaggerated by the fact that they are all named after cabinet members of the three administrations.  As a result, it's tempting to call this game Dead White Men: The Card Game.

I'm not yet sure how I feel about the model of the war.  Although the broad diplomatic strokes feel right, and the chrome has lots of interesting points, I'm not sure I actually feel that much like one of the three statesmen I'm supposed to be representing.  It's a nice big romantic theme, but I struggle at the end of the day not to think that I'm playing a very abstract card game.

I am really conflicted about this one. On one hand, it is a very clever and engaging game, with some pretty innovative and cool mechanics. On the other hand, it is far too long and samey after a while, but the short campaigns do not give it enough of the epic feel that it deserves and that really shines through the full 10-conference campaign game.

Long game and due to the victory conditions it will always be a close game. This makes it tense. The VCs add so much to the game. Well themed and looks good. The idea of winning the war at the conference table and playing it out on the war fronts is genius. Need to invest a little time to it (play the tutorial which is the final 3 conferences) but once you have then the mechanics are straight forward. The fact that you can play with less than 3, against bots is great. Only reason it would not get to rhe table as often as one would like is that it is long, but it it is a long game we are after this would be the go to game. Wow

The full 10 conference game is amazing!  It takes about 5 hours, but it's an engaging, immersive, challenging experience the whole time.  Lots of knobs to turn.  Lots of shifting alliances and emerging partnerships.  Great choices on how to manage when or if the war will end, who will benefit from what actions and how, what strategies to pursue.  I keep thinking about it for a long time after a play.  The shorter, five conference game is good, too, but it seems to really shine at the 10 conference length.

RATING: 9
This is an instant classic.  It is a highly unique game that is extremely immersive, thematic, interactive, engaging, and also serves to illustrate a situation that has very rarely, if ever, been treated in a game.  Chances are that you have never played a game quite like this.  The production is the usual GMT top-notch quality.

The victory conditions really capture the feel of the situation, and also help to keep the game well balanced and very close (no matter what happens).  They include a very effective check on the runaway leader problem.

This is not a wargame, but it has some wargamey elements.  It is very abstract, and handles the war in Europe in a very abstract way.  I imagine it would appeal to fans of almost any genre, but it is not a simple game.  The rules are relatively easily digested, but there is a lot going on, may ways to score VPs and a lot of phases to deal with in a turn.  If you are a Euro-player that likes medium to heavy weight games, it should be no problem to grok it.  But because the game has so many elements, strategy runs very deep.  There are a lot of ways to get where you want to go in this game, and replayability should be high as you explore all of the different ways to succeed in Churchill.

You have to be cooperative with the other players, but also competitive to gather the most VP posible with a reasonable margin, all mechanics make sense.

Its not a war game but it´s not also an euro, this feels more like CDG like Twilight struggle with some area control and negotiation mechanics (although negotiation is not the main mechanic). Feel a lot like a tactical game driven by the use of cards (hand management is vital) and also has the luck elements from random events and some dice rolling.

AWESOME GAME that may be liked by euro gamers, give a try if you get the chance for a very different and fun gaming experience.

This game is clearly ahead of its time.. 
The only reason this game isn't rated higher is because IT'S NOT A WARGAME!!!
But people assume it is.. and then are dissapointed.
The map is basically just a point track, and not a subgame in itself like in pericles. (wich in turn feels much more like a wargame)

Never have i ever enjoyed multiplayer games in wich you negotiate about whom to attack/spare etc. But this one has a catch! Figuring out what each of the others is going for and trying to play them against each other was at least for me a revelation.

And the beauty is.. even IF both stack against you, you can still win because of the rather uncommon victory condition. It's hard to encompass all the subtleties around the issue selection and card play.. so if you can appreciate subtleties try this one.

Really, really awful.  I played this once and I regret it.  The primary activity is basically like the game Gloom.  I play a four card and move this thing four spaces towards me -- then my opponent plays a five and moves it five spaces away from me towards him.  This mechanic strikes me as being patently terrible, like determining who wins what by coin toss.  Perhaps the popular opinion is that a third contestant somehow makes this conference-via-card-number-comparison-book-keeping more interesting.  That was not my experience.  The conferences provide resources for each player to commit to various fronts, then the progress on each front is determined by a tortured set of silly dice-rolling mechanics.  After the first turn I was shocked when my opponents wanted to continue playing.  This awful little game wears on for hours.  At least Churchill will never have to see his name on the box.  Anyone who wants to prove that games are just a waste of time has a powerful piece of evidence in this product.  Only a true effort at self-control has stopped me from using a string of profanity to describe this game.

One play. Pretty good game. The amount of information you need to take in, the amount of text you need to take in and understand what everything does can overwhelm you when you first play the game.   Not knowing what everything does can also overwhelm you.    I found the game to be very interesting, it is a political, talky kind of game and then you resolve military effects on the map. 

Combining Euro victory points, abstracted military blocks/placements and heavy political talks to decide where and how things would get resolved was quite interesting.

It would lend itself to the right crowd of talking people.

Small complaints: I still wasn't sure what the Clandastine Network does, all it seems to do is give victory points.  Thematically its meant to represent the division of the board post WW2, but during the game it doesn't seem to do anything other than give points.

Some parts of the map are confusing, like the Artic one; I had 3x navy there and never used it, it never moved. The map is also very heavy on text.

I did like the game, but I probably won't be buying it.

A curious combination of light weight, tough choices, co-operation, competition, luck, diplomacy, and crazy VP scoring. Can become tedious with AP prone players, but experience should help with that.

Master piece. First of its kind. Best 3-player game there is. Simulates politics both on mechanical and social level (you can play both levels or just mechanical - card play), very very thematic. Can be played competitively TS style or as a role-playing experience... Great story every time through, provokes funny referential comments and jokes. As such, it is a perfect game for anyone even mildly interested in the subject.

Can get very mean and "take that", especially due to the scoring mechanisms that are both unique and challenging for a typical gamer. Frustrations go away after some play when you learn what to expect. Strict player count (would never play with bots again).

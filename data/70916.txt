Would be clever if it weren't so obtuse to explain. Doesn't feel so rock band like as it does some other theme.

Rock band managers will probably not like it.

I'm always in for music themed games even if they are not the heaviest or deepest experiences out there. RockBand Manager looks like rather lite card game and the auction of the band members reminds me of For Sale except it takes a lot more time.

Second part of the game takes the game a bit deeper in thought than the game first looked like to take you. Mechanism in which you use the band members to gather cards which score you points is interesting and feels new. Unfortunately with five it took again quite a lot of time.

I have mixed feelings. RockBand Manager has a lot to like but it just seems to take too much time keep the interest on for a full game.

This game felt bad and I don't know why other than the stupid take that cards. Perhaps the lack of tension and build up (because the game never felt tight)+ take that made it feel bad.

Most unusual that it is not a licensed property of the videogame, as much of the branding is *extremely* similar. Still, a nice competitive bidding-war game that serves as a good standby/opener title. Could have benefited from a little more variety in the cards.

A kommentek alapján kicsit féltem tőle, hogy a témán kívül semmi nem lesz benne. Ehhez képest kellemes csalódás volt. Bőven van benne kombinálni agyalni való. Ez igaz akkor is, ha csak a saját lehetőségeidet nézed, de ha nagyon jó vagy elkezdhetsz a többiek fejével is gondolkodni.
Szóval összességében nagyon alulértékel játéknak érzem. Akinek tetszik a for sale, annak ez is fog, mert ez tulajdonképpen egy kicsit összetettebb variánsa.

An inelegant For Sale, with 4 times the playlength, and a more attractive (though completely pasted on) theme.

Considering this is a FFG product, the "inelegance" may not be a problem for the target audience.  It sure feels more gamey, and offers different strategies compared to For Sale.


Most negative point for me: End game scoring. A major hassle.

Example scoring: 32 + 12 + "all red values are raised by one" + "you gain a point for your reds" + 7 + 6 + 9 + 12 + "your best blue is worth twice as much" + "raise all blue values by 1" + 1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 13.

Not funny.  The game would have been just as fun if they would have a) cut all score values in half b) dailed down on the special scoring modifiers.

RATING: 7.5
My least favorite Bauza game. The theme and artwork are top notch and had initially attracted me to the game, however there are a few things that were somewhat bothered me when I played. The first thing is the bidding concept. Didnt quite enjoy the long drafting phase of band members- I mean, it was fun to see that you invest so much on a high level card and then come to find that the next card was stronger- it just takes too long to get the game started. The next thing is the tie breaker rule: when the touring phase finally starts, rarely will a player have more than 2 bank notes and most players will have 0-1 at their disposal. Overall, the game is 'ok'- just not great like most of his other games.

RATING: 5
Hire the best Vocalist, Guitarist, Drummer, Bass guitarist and pianist to form up your band with limited resources you have.

Bid for performances based on the band you created and make it to competitions to win awards and records.

A pure bidding game more which involves minimal strategy. Not recommended for people who dislike bidding

RATING: N/A
Bought this only because I'm a huge fan of rock music and because the game is designed by Antoine Bauza. The game also looks very cute indeed and all those musicians for hire have such cool and funny names. Probably the game itself isn't even good, but we'll see. This is more like a party game for music enthusiasts. 
I haven't played this yet, but when the time is ripe and with the right rockers around, I will give it a go.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (May 2015)

In general, I find Bauza games to be from regular to ok designs, so I had very little expectation toward Rockband Manager. However the game surprised me (better than expected) and I had fun playing it.

The rules are easy to grasp but more convoluted than expected for such a simple/light game. You can explain them under ten minutes. The game components are great as is usual from FFG and the art is ok. 

Rockband Manager is a bidding game at its heart. At first you have to bid money and then you have to bid cards. It it's reminiscent of For Sale but a lot longer (a negative for me).

I'm indifferent toward the theme, but many friends liked it. 

I feel the game has lots of uncontrollable luck in the first phase because you can only see the first card AND you can only have one of each kind of rock star. In our games it was a common occurrence to pay a lot for a rock star and then find the one below it to be much better and, to add insult to injury, it generally was bought a lot cheaper. However, as the game is very simple and it moves at a fast pace, that luck of the draw doesn't bother me that much. 

The other two phases are much fairer as everyone can see all the cards and there can be duels between players. However some cards seem overly powerful (perhaps unbalanced?).

On the box says the game is for 3 to 6 players, but I feel 3 players won't enjoy they game properly. You need at least 4 players. 

Bottom line, Rockband Manager it's a light bidding game geared toward the casual gamers. I would play again if requested but I won't pursue anymore plays of this. Rockband Manager is perhaps a bit too long for what it offers. I already sold my copy.

Rockband Manager could use some streamlining, especially the initial auction for band members seems to take wayyyy too long compared to the rest of the game and should've been replaced with a faster mechanism. Rest of the game is ok-ish for a light filler.

Card art is a wasted opportunity: such a fun theme could've inspired cards full of stuff for rock fans to look at and notice, instead the cards are generic comic book art done by somebody who clearly didn't care at all about the theme (bass players don't play basses, etc).

Quirky and fun auction game with a fantastic theme. I would caution potential buyers that there is a little more realism in here than you might expect, such as with the Overdose card, but the game is a lot of fun. Playing concerts seems to be the way to win, but you can't really ignore albums either. Shares some similarities with For Sale, but I appreciate the theme far more here. Definitely an underrated game, in my opinion.

First impression (6 players): On some other circumstances it could've been a better experience. With 6 players that were looking for (hopefully a bit meatier) less-than-hour game this was a disaster. For one, it wasn't short as in first phase there are several around the table auctions and after that there is 10 rounds where you try to score as many points as possible. Secondly it wasn't too serious at all since the action cards can create huge swings and it's kind of random (especially towards the end of phase) who can get some of them. For non-gamers who don't try to optimize too much about their play it actually would go a lot faster and maybe be worthwile playing but I'll most likely never play this again.

RATING: 6
A decent little card game, in serious need of an English translation. The system using the auctioned cards (i.e. band members) and leftover money for acquiring the scoring cards is rather interesting. 

The band auction seems to take a bit too much time but the later phases flow smoothly enough. The special cards are powerful but the chaos level still manages to stay significantly lower than the French average.

Fun little game - underrated. 

We love the theme which helps. The mechanics are simple, but if you can buy into the idea that you're building your own rock group then it makes a big difference. 

We have favourite characters that everyone bids crazy money for, and we have bogeymen that if you have them on your team, it makes you a laughing stock (Mr Bananas, I'm looking at you). This makes drafting, and rare event cards that force you to change out band members for a random replacement, much more fun.

We don't play it often, but every time we do play it, I wonder why we don't play it more.

A lot going on in this filler, with three stages to the game . My rating based on one 3 player game, which we all agreed notbtheoptimal number because of the scoring and not enough interaction in the auctions and selection in stages 2 and 3. Looking forward to trying with 5


Too much going on -,quite fiddly , For Sale a much better game

RATING: 6
An interesting game with a lot of little mechanics - it's mainly an auction game, but there are bits of variable player powers and bluffing that all combine to a very unique game. Unfortunately, I think it has a little too much luck as to which cards come out of the deck. When a single player can take the "best" card with no contest, actions sometimes seem chosen for you.

This game lives on theme alone.  And the theme doesn't really work in the second and third round of the game.
As someone said, like a bad version of For Sale ; with twice the playing time, twice the randomness and no fun.

Take For Sale, remove all of the elegance, add randomness, add 'take that' cards, add multiple currencies, add about 40 minutes of playing time and you have Rockband Manager.

Antoine Bauza can, and does, do better than this. I feel that perhaps he feels the same way about FFG that I do and that's why he licensed this game to them...

A fun game in the right circumstances. I think it needs to have at least 4 players (I prefer 6) in order to add the needed competition over cards and awards. It can get kind of crazy, and you'll be cursing your lead singer for not being charismatic enough to claim the concert card you need. The auction to build your band can take a little time, so the person running the game needs to make sure he keeps that part moving quickly so people don't lose interest. The rest of the game is simultaneous card play, so everyone should be engaged after that.

RATING: 6
Some nice ideas and mechanics, but bit too long and too much possibilites for AP.

Although games that have many different steps/stages are nice (they develop a better story), the price you have to pay is in the more complicated and detailed rules. This happens here as well to some degree. Compared to the fillerish/luck-driven nature of the game, I think it is a bit too long and slow-moving.

This is a lovely little game, with lots of strategy and player interaction. The rules are easy to learn, but depending on who you are playing with, this game can be really hard. The most interesting part is trying to fake out your opponent and guessing what they want to do. When trying out the solitaire game mode, I was positively surprised. It's not the deepest solo game, but it is fairly solid and plays quickly as well. The best score I have got so far is "Handsome Spirit", so I'm not finished with the solo mode quite yet. The only glaring problem I have with the game is that the component quality is sub-par. The cards are fine, but the box is kind of flimsy, and the small plastic chips are terrible. The plastic on top forms bubbles, and the chips themselves feel awkwardly cheap. Other than that, the art and the overall design of the game is gorgeous.

Mostly bought this because it has Bird in the title, and cute pictures of birds on the cards. "Bird" is a phrase used a LOT in my gaming group, so kind of an inside joke, but this game is actually very good. Relaxing and brain busting at the same time.

An interesting game but one that just felt like a random play a card and hope for the best. There might be a way of skewing the game in your favor to help with a card you're led holding. I just don't know how I would go about applying that skew. Maybe things will feel less random with lower player counts.

Personally, i really enjoyed this game. It plays very quickly, we played twice. We did play in a blocking fashion, which menat it became very obvious which bird would win early on. First play, we all had the bird in hand, second game two of had the bird. So the winner was the payer with the highest number, which was the same player.

Which means when I play it again, my tactics will change. The winner thought the game would improve if players had to pick their bird after a few turns, but i disagree. I think we just played in a negative way, it was fun, very amusing, but lead us done an obvious path.

The artwork is gorgeous. Personally, I highly recommend this game but suggest you might try before you buy.

A beautiful and simple card game where you put birds down in a grid. Majorities in rows and columns score the corresponding points (nuts). The twist is that ties eliminate each other and that each player scores the color bird which they have left in their hand at the end of the round. On top of that with 4 players there is also an owl card which can be used to displace an already played bird.

This is a fun game for such a simple rules. The art on the cards is some of the nicest I have ever seen in a game (I like birds). I also tried the coop variant and that is very enjoyable as well!

How utterly pretty - although I suspect that with 2 players, there might be a lot of draws. With more players, one can fall behind in the first round without any hope of catching up in the second, which is a major drawback. I still enjoy the game, but the two round rule seems to make no sense to me at all. So I suggest to play one round rather than two.  
All in all, the game reminds me a little bit of "Too Many Cinderellas", which I prefer.

This is my surprise favorite game of 2017 - beautiful cards, super simple mechanics, but surprisingly deep gameplay in a variety of modes.  It sports two innovative mechanics - scoring based on the color and number of the last card you hold, and the colors of the birds that are tied for first (birdie fight!) are eliminated.  The first mechanic forces you to plan ahead in the midst of uncertainty, else at the end, you may shoot yourself in the foot by being unable to play the card you want to score and having to play all the other cards you aren't scoring (helping those colors score better).  The second mechanic gives you some recourse to find opportunities to play cards that you do not want to play in a constructive manner.

In addition, I like it for the following reasons:

1) Simple to teach, difficult to master: The game takes about 2 minutes to explain, but even after many plays, it is difficult to consistently do well in the game.  To do well consistently, you have to not only develop a coherent strategy given the cards you have, put yourself into the shoes of other players, calculate probabilistic outcomes, and look ahead at potential plays.  There is a whole lot going on in such a simple filler!  And of course everyone is trying to do the same thing, and will adjust their play and strategy according to the choices you make.

2) Simple to play, tough plays to make: this is similar to my first point, but focused at the scale of one turn.  On your turn, the only play you make is to place a card in your hand somewhere in the common playing area.  You can almost do this mindlessly if you really wanted to.  Or you can agonize over your decision of what card to pick and where to place it for minutes as everyone stares breathlessly at the board in anticipation while you ponder the potential future board states, calculate what cards are still unplayed, hypothesize who still has what cards based on their play, and what signal you'd like to convey based on your next play.  This leads to a delicious kind of AP that I don't mind and others tend not to mind since their play critically influences the common board state.  Furthermore, at the end, sometimes you are left with the excruciating choice of having to choose between shooting your left foot or right foot - regardless of which card you choose, keeping one bird forces you to toss the other one onto the board, often hurting your score.  It is brilliantly designed, and the ties (birdie fights) are not only thematic but crucial to making the game interesting.

3) Flexibility in strategy.  Based on your hand, you can formulate a starting strategy.  Do you go for the bird you have most in your hand?  Do you go for the bird where you only have one card in your hand and try to secretly help him by creating ties all over the board?  Do you hedge by diversifying and delaying your choice (with the downside that often this results in you shooting yourself).  Whatever you choose, since you don't score until you are left with one card, you can often change strategies mid-game based on the board state and card play of your opponents.  Finally, you can consider the metagame of bluffing and feinting with your own card play, misdirecting your opponents towards your true intentions.

4) Numerous modes.  Birdie Fight supports cooperative play between 2-4 players and also cooperative play for 1-2 players.  Competitive mode is what I usually play, but the cooperative mode is actually a lot of fun too and often quite challenging.  The game is simple enough that I've created a variant for 5 people given the cards in the TBD edition, called Songbirds.

Birdie Fight is a phenomenal deep filler game.  The artwork is beautiful, and in the first edition, you even have interesting components like the scoring cards and using the box for scoring.  My highest recommendations.

A light looking game with only interesting decisions. The randomness of the deal can put folks at a disadvantage, but that's par for the course for most card games. I think you need to play at least a round before you can play strategically, but the game is quick.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I see the comparisons to Arboretum but in this one everyone is building a common "forest" in order to try and create majorities in the rows and columns for the color of the card they plan to keep from their hand of 7 cards. Can be quite nasty. Also would recommend playing several rounds to try and balance out the role of luck of the deal, etc. It was an interesting game and one I wish to explore more.

Very simple rules make for some interesting choices and exciting moments.  Highly portable.  Scoring is a surprise until the end of the round.  Early turns don't feel like they have a clear strategy and late turns can be slow as players calculate the best move.  Fewer options when playing a four player game, but still good.

This one reminds me a bit of Arboretum because you need to keep a card in the end to score points. It's much faster though and less difficult to play, not that it's easy to win though. Game looks great and you want to outguess your opponents favorite bird. You need to anticipate to change colors in the end though and if you have high cards in your hand, it always helps.

A very pretty design where you are placing cards with different coloured birds on them into a 5 x 5 grid where the strongest birds in each row and column will score points. You keep one card back in your hand and at the end of the game that it the colour of bird that you will get points for.
I need more plays of this game as there is a lot going on underneath the surface here.

RATING: 5
It's hard for me to get excited about a mechanic as simple and abstract as this, laying cards out in a grid. Based on your starting hand, choose two colours you're definitely not going to keep until the end and play them so they overkill on low scoring rows/columns, whilst trying to "just win" rows/columns in the colour you'd like to score in. At its core is the obvious tactic of not playing in places to allow an opponent to close down a row/column. Any more than 2 players and it's going to get chaotic. The game just doesn't really bring anything new to the table conceptually, provides too much strategic ambiguity during the opening to be enjoyable, and in the end it's a bit of an abstract lottery. The timeframe and ease of rules are good, but this isn't my kind of thing anymore.

What a superb, beautiful and elegant game. Every single decision is torturous in the best possible way. Deciding during the game if you're sticking with a particular colour, or going to change mid-game, figuring out which colour your opponent seems to be stack in their favour and if you should try thwart their efforts. This is an excellent game that needs more attention. It also plays great at 2+ players with added variants. Add it to your collection if this is something you think you'd enjoy.

Like it more when playing cooperative/solo than competitive.  The competitive mode ends up feeling like holding a bunch of different colors in your hand towards the end of the game and then calculating where you can actually win with the colors you have left in your hand.  You also have to hope that the other players don't have the seven of that color.

RATING: 7
Beneath the very pleasing exterior of Birdie Fight is a game which requires a lot more brainpower than initially appears. This is a game which uses area majorities to determine the eventual value of a particular bird set, and players must gradually commit to backing a particular set.

In many ways this is a pseudo-shareholding game, albeit with each player holding onto a single share each. Having opponents invest in the same set means that there is some collective interest to increase the set's value, but it also means there are fewer cards to do so. The only drawback is that the last few turns have the potential for downtime as players have to keep track of which cards have yet to be played.

Rating for mechanics only. Not as complex as arboretum or as interesting. If it wasn't for the amazing art (I'm biased toward birds), this game wouldn't have been anything special. Would play it more to look at those cards though. I almost want to frame them I love them so much.

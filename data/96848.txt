There are few games that I think about during the day and truly feel excited to play when I get home. This is one of those games! Yes, it is rules heavy. But my 14 year old and I really had no trouble figuring out how to play. Yes, it is long. But the more you play, the faster the games go. I highly recommend this game if you have learned other complex games like Twilight Imperium or Sid Meir's Civilization. If you can handle those games then you can handle this one.

06-16-14: This was my favorite game for the longest time, but as I've refined my tastes I've had to bump this down from a '10'.

This is a very well designed game, and it is one of several Vlaada Chvatil games in our collection. But at its core it is only a puzzle solving solitaire game with multiple players. I doubt I will ever play it again with more than 3 players.

02-07-15: I think I would rate this as a 9.5/10 as a solo game, 8.5/8 as a 2-3 player game, and a 3 (!) with 4 players (official BGG rating meaning I would never ever play it with 4 again).

Not quite my favourite game, but if I could only have 1 game  for the rest of my life, it would probably be this.

RATING: 5
Only done a solo runthrough of the intro scenario so far. I'm the king of premature ratings but even I need more time to evaluate. 

The main rulebook is a great reference AFTER you've finished the runthrough, probably looks like a hot mess beforehand. Another superb rules job from Vlaada.

There's a lot to take in and I think I'd want at least a couple more sessions before attempting to teach it. But it's very attractive and satisfying to puzzle out. There's a tangible sense of freedom and adventure. 

As per FCM and TTA, I fully expect this rating to go up with more plays.

edit: nope. while it certainly works and it's a well put-together beast of a game, its too long and too much effort for the payoff IMO.

RATING: 10
This game might look ugly (at least part of it), but it's wonderfully deep and engaging. Definitely in my top five. The epic scale, strategic planning aspect and balanced character development keeps it engaging through six-hour sessions. Highly recommended to any hardcore gamer.

The rulebook and intro scenario book are great, in my opinion, and I have found that I actually have to consult BBG less than with many other games. On the whole the game is a tight, complex challange where you have to always keep your eyes on your goal to get there in the end.

Rating is based on few plays and might change.

EDIT: Have now played it a couple more times since giving the game a 10, and I'm NOT changing the rating. What a game!

What a monster of a game! The way that this game uses deck building as an underlying mechanism to control your hero in the game is absolutely brilliant. Stunning artwork, lots and lots and lots of stuff in it, this is absolutely brilliant design! The only thing that keeps me from playing this game more is the length of playing time for it, but otherwise, this is another great game from Vlaada.

What a monster. On one hand, wow... what an amazingly designed game. Impressive depth, awesome mechanics, solid theme. So much I like. One the other hand... it's so heavy; long set-up time, long playtime, constant rule-checking. It's a game I want to play more but its sheer massive scope makes it less likely to be played. That's why I notched it down to a 9 for now. I may change the rating after further playing.

Brought it down to 8.5 after another game. Games where I'm glued to the rule book -- no matter how great the mechanics -- deserve to be a little lower. Still amazing, but a little much for me (and that's saying something).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely amazing game.  I have not yet played this co-op, only solo.  It's a fantastic puzzle.  The game is solid from start to finish.  There are a lot of moving parts, but all of the systems flow together nicely.  What initially looks complex, is masterfully done and in the end, very intuitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A solo game disguised as multiplayer game.

My first impression leaves me not entirely convinced. It is a glorified card game that feels too drawn out and chaotic, with lots of downtime and too much luck and AP for my taste. 

In the good and the bad it has the hallmarks of a Vlaada Chvatil design: some neat ideas, but ultimately feels like it's lacking proper development to truly realise its potential. Now it feels like it's stuck in a clunky prototype stage. 

I like some of the visuals, but overall the component quality does not impress me. I'd say it needs more plays to properly grok it, but ATM it doesn't interest me that much. 

Horribly expensive.

RATING: 9
I have played this as a solitaire experience several times and still do not know what the big deal is. I don't know whether I enjoy it or not. It's odd. More plays will tell, however introducing this to the kids is a bear, and will limit the time it sees on the table.

Update: I'm thinking this is one of the finer solitaire experiences around. Bumping this from 8 to a 9+. I'm still trying to introduce this to the kids -- and to a group we assemble every so often, but without success so far. It's certainly daunting, and we find we favor games we already know well to get on the table. We'll see though.

Update: Two things regarding component quality. (1) The cards from the expansion are clearly of different finish and quality than those of the base game. Sleeving the cards solves this problem handily. (2) The expansion tiles are definitely a different shade than the tiles from the base game. Simply use dice to make the appropriate tile selection, adjusting the results to account for the remaining tiles for the scenario. I prefer a d20 for this, as you can determine one chance in two (odd/even), one chance in three (1-6, 7-12, 13-18, rerolling 19,20), one chance in four (1-5, etc.), one chance in five (1-4, etc.), one chance in six (1-3, ..., rerolling 19-20), etc.

This way, you don't have any issue with, nor do you care about how the tiles look. You have a pool from which to select, and the dice make the selection. It's always just as much of a surprise as if the tiles were in a stack.

I Love this game and as a beginner board gamer this is my first title, the thing that drew me to this game initially was the fact it could be played by ones self and after some research into solo board game this was the one that came out at the top of everyones list. I was worried initially wether or not to buy this game due to the multiple reviews of people saying how complicated the game was, but after completing the walk through twice and a read through the rules (which are quite long) I was away. I know can't get enough of this game and much to my wife despair I think this could be the beginning of a life long affair with board games and at the very least with Mage Knight. 

The game can take a while so it is a good idea to ensure you can complete the game in one sitting of at least have a space to leave it idle were it can't be disturbed until you can return. If you want a fun and enjoyable game that you're going to want to keep coming back to then look no further you've found it. 

Happy Playing,

Love Mage Knight! I'll state that right off the bat. I just want to keep playing. And it wasn't until we compared it to its descendant "Star Trek: Frontiers" did we realize just how beautiful - artwork and components - and rich in gameplay - day and night, fortification, etc. - and immersive and magical the game really is (see my "Star Trek: Frontiers" comments. We had a difficult time getting started with it because back then we had such little experience with this type of game and flipping back and forth between the two manuals was a challenge. We put it on the shelf. Later, though, I kept having little flashbacks about its fascinating mechanics. Which game had the crystals? Which game had a shared mana base and a day and a night phase? Which game had a draft for a special ability? Which game had two actions to choose from on a card? Mage Knight?! Mage Knight! We played it again. Suddenly it all made perfect sense and I had SO MUCH FUN. We couldn't believe why we thought it was so hard.

Can't rate this a 10 yet, but I really like this game.  Played 2 partial solo games and looking forward to playing 2 more games this week.
Played 2 more games.  This is not a 10 for me, but it is an absolutely fantastic game.

Edit: Played this 8 times now.  Really enjoy the game.  Still want to play it.  

Edit: Dropping to an 8.  I enjoy this game, but teaching it is a difficult and lengthy process.  It seems best to play 2 games in a row (1 learning and 1 regular), but that is tough to achieve.

Edit: Raising it to a 9.  Played it with the expansion.  It's long but worth the investment

Edit: Down to 7.5.  Just too long and too fiddly.  Unlikely to play more than once a year at most.

Played this game tonight with 5 players (we were using the expansion). I think it is an amazing and original solo game, but given the massive amount of rules, huge downtimes, strange coop mechanics, and overall fiddlyness, I do not think I would recommend this game for groups. It may work okay with two players, but definitely do not make the mistake of playing it with large numbers. Since we did not end up finishing the game (ran out of time), I am not providing a rating.

This hasn't clicked for me like it has for others.  Too many things irritate me.  It is needlessly complex and too text heavy.  AP is heavy and turns are slow because you feel like you have to plan each one optimally, which seriously decreases FPM (Fun Per Minute).  And for goodness sake why do I have to waste all my cool actions just to move somewhere - why can't I just move?!  I like leveling up and exploring, but the rest of the game feels tedious. Hoping it improves on repeat play.

RATING: 6.5
In short, I was glad that I played the game, I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I am happy that I didn't buy it. 

Here is what I didn't like:

- The down-time with four was pretty ridiculous, yes, it was learning game, and yes, this probably goes down with more plays... but still.

- The learning curve was steep. I was glad that somebody else was teaching the game because I would not want that job... so many little details - yes, most of them could be learned when they arose, but I couldn't help frequently asking myself, "what is this or that little detail adding to the game experience... would the game still be good without it?" I'm sure the rules aren't that complex once you get them but you need to be a hard-core gamer to go through the effort and most of my friends don't fit into this category.

- The theme. Actually, to answer one of my questions above, my impression was that many of the complex rules where there to further develop the theme. Indeed, insofar as the thematicness of a game is measured by the beautiful components and rules that directly represent thematic situations, the game is extremely thematic. For me, though, the theme didn't really work on another level - I like my heroes to be defined by some larger concern or struggle, but the heroes in this game are just seeking power. I don't find that thematically interesting. I think I would have enjoyed this kind of system much more had it been applied to a co-op or an accordingly balanced full-out confrontational game.

- This game is multiplayer solitaire with indirect confrontation of the annoying kind. Essentially, you interact with other players only by stealing things from underneath of their noses. My impression is that the game works kind of like this: a lot of your play is determined by circumstances created by other players... however, these players are generally playing to first and foremost further their own self-interest and not to hinder that of others... in most situations, hindering the interests of others is just inconvenient and would pull both the hinderer and the hindered behind everyone else. Thus, when someone effects someone else its because they happened to be in a position where it was possible for them to do this. In other words, the hindered person just got unlucky in a big way, which is't cool in this sort of game. 

So, those are my impressions of Mage Knight after a 3+ hour mini-learning game. It probably all sounds rather harsh but I'm just trying to look at it objectively. In fact, I didn't dislike the game and will probably like it more with more plays. However, I would be very surprised if my rating of this game would ever go higher than a 7.

This is a thinking man's version of something akin to Runebound. Very tightly wound, there are a surprising amount of subtle rules to track (e.g. there are many location types and card types in the game) which leads to rules references and complexity. This is to be expected from any elaborate fantasy adventure game. I enjoyed it very much over all, and although it is true there is 'strategy' to the game, it's more a very well done adventure experience. The use of cards is smarter than I expected, but it certainly isn't a deck builder. More like a deck-driven action game. It takes a very long time to play out - which is expected as well, but exhausting. Still, very good game.

1 partida, curioso aunque al ser a 4, bastante lento y muchísimo AP. Habría que probarlo con menos jugadores y sin ser el juego básico en ese aspecto. Tenia demasiadas espectativas en este juego, que me ha decepcionado bastante, lo esperaba mucho mejor. La estragia se limita a las 5 cartas que te toquen en cada turno, que tienes que buscar el mejor combo entre ellas, que normalmente optimizarlo es sólo un camino, el terreno que salga, los dados con los simbolos de color... etc, tiene muuucho factor suerte, muy caótico, por lo que o te encanta esto o el juego no te gusta (ameritrash puro). Como positivo, es muy variado, y el tema dia y noche esta curioso. Como anécdota, me recuerda al Heroes Of Might & Magic de PC en juego de mesa

RATING: 6
Oh Bloody Chvátil, what have you done again. You have given us a rather simple game with so many layers that it has become very difficult to learn, memorise and teach the rules. It certainly is not a good quality to a game if you have to spend your first plays browsing through the rulebook pondering how everything works. Sure, you can watch the tutorial videos and read the rules and think "OK, now I've got this." But when it is the time to play, you will be facing so many exceptional situations that you just have to check, how it goes again. There is a need for tracking of so many things simultaneously, i.e., you are constantly flipping tokens, pushing tokens, drawing cards, playing cards, rolling dice etc. All this while trying to keep all the restrictions in mind. There are too many things you have to get into your kinetic memory.

Once every single player in the table gets a hang of it, the game becomes a smooth, fast and enjoyable experience. But I literally mean EVERYONE. Should there be even a single player who requires assistance with the rules, the flow is gone.

When it comes to the gameplay, I like the deck building and hand management aspect. It is a brilliant choice for a RPG style boardgame adding more decision making and strategy to the standard action point allocation system. It is also a nice thing that battles are not totally random. However, a hint of uncertainty and push-your-luck elements in the battle would have been nice. Not too random but just a tiny little bit. With a deterministic battle system you know exactly whether you can beat the monster or not. This does not encourage heroic moves against against all odds. 

In a nutshell, a fun game and a fun experience. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that Mage Knight is a single use fun. By single I mean that you'll probably play this quite a bit at one time of your life, but after that never again. Re-learning the game will be just too much of an effort for occasional playing, and hence the game will stay in your shelf untouched ever after, no matter how good it was and how fond memories you have of it. But if you have time, investing it in Mage Knight is not a bad choice.

RATING: 5
I am on the fence with this one, I don't find it very complicated like most people say they do, if you play it once its style is so unique that you will not forget its rules, it is that sometimes it may get dry and you may need to take a break away from it because it is a game of riddles every step of the way. If you like that sort of thing you will love Mage Knight, if you are looking for an adventure game maybe this one isn't for you, by the time you finish calculating your next move you will most likely be staring at a corner like an idiot...games are supposed to be fun Mr Vlada and this game is fiddly and tedious.

A co-op might not be bad, but I don't think I'd want to play with more than 2 players, at least at my experience level.  I could see it being decent with more if the other players have more experience so there isn't as much AP involved.

Thematically evocative of the Heroes of Might and Magic video game series, with a deep and satisfying hand management/deck building system to interact with the world. However, I'm not particularly interested in solo board gaming and large rules overhead and fiddly setup meant this was never really going to hit the table for 2+ players. Playing multiplayer also feels like everyone is playing a solo game, unless you opt for the PvP mode (which I did not try) - which adds even more rules complexity. The game also rewards really taking your time on turns to solve the puzzle in your hand, which creates a lot of downtime in multiplayer.

Removed from collection.

Mage Knight is probably THE adventure game on the market right now. It has beautiful components and you really get that feeling of leveling up and advancing with your character.
The difficulty of the different scenarios is quite high and challenging.
The 4 different mage knights only differ in their standard decks in 1 single card and in their different skills which they gain after leveling up. I felt that they could have put some more unique cards into the according decks to give every knight a totally different approach while playing but thats okay.
The game comes with various scenarios which arent predefined levels such as in 
descent or other dungeon crawlers but simply set up the game and give the instructions such as number of rounds to be played and so on.
Mage Knight can be played solo, cooperative and competetive, whereas cooperative feels more like a huge solo experience just with more players. The skills which were only made for this mode just show up too randomly to have any effects on the gameplay.
Competetivly played this game gets another boost since you always have to watch your back.
The real con of the game is its long amount of time to be played and the downtime when playing with other people.

3 hours (that goes flying) of a great puzzle.
Thinking the best way to spend the cards and skills you have in your hand, across a different set of terrains, enemies and places, to accomplish a scenario (out of several) goal.
3 hours of great entertainment. 

When played with more people, the same above applies (but keep in mind, you'll need between 3~ to 6~ hours of the day to play)

Rating based on solo game only. Haven't played PvP or coop.

I like the puzzle-like nature of the game. Thinking about things like the interactions of the cards or what cards have come up and what cards remain to be used, while also considering the timing of movement and where to move, makes me feel like I am making interesting and even agonizing decisions. Often though, this makes for long turns for me.

Yes, there will be random features such as what is in the offer pile or what tiles come up but I like the fact that you need to adapt to the situation each time, almost every turn. So there feels like a grand strategy can be adopted but it is more of a tactical game in nature so if you do  not adapt, you will lose.

It seems like playing against or with others would simply take too long so I probably won't do it.

A lot of rules to remember, especially as it relates to the monster tokens and how to defeat them, and I find myself referring back to the rule book often even while considering my options. This breaks the immersion for me.

This game nicely encapsulates the narrative quality of a fantasy adventure tale, even with it's crunchy Euro-style hand management. Like a pen-and-paper RPG but without the time investment, Mage Knight is really good at creating a sense of story progression as your character travels the countryside, fights monsters, and learns new skills. The mechanics are elegant and engrossing (I am especially impressed with how the deckbuilding mechanic is woven into the game), and the replayability is nearly limitless. One of my all-time favorites.

Fantastic game. Every game plays quite differently and there's always the feeling of "if only I had one more card/crystal/unit/etc". Cons would be game length (forever, but not a bad thing if you like the game and are in no hurry) and that one of the 4 player units is underpowered compared to the other 3.

Excellent game!  Brings a fantastic RPG feel to tabletop gaming.  I like how the deck building aspect drives the game (your options and available choices) without diluting the RPG elements.

Reasons I don't rate this higher:

(1)  Rules are not for the faint of heart (but it is emulating a RPG, so you should be expecting some rules complexity).

(2)  Not a fast play.  Yes, subsequent plays will increase speed, but the game does not lend itself to fast play.  Expect long games of this.

(3)  Bad luck early on carries through.  The rich get richer.  Success breeds success.  No catch up mechanism.  (How many different ways can I say the same thing?)

Notwithstanding the above, really an excellent game!

9/01/13:  Upping my rating to a 9.  (1) becomes better with repeated plays, as does (2).  (3) is true, but you have to be willing to push things and take some wounds.  Not the end of the world if the mob goes down, not at all.

Probably is best at 1 or 2 to avoid lengthy downtime and shorten the game.  I will be playing this more.

Mage Knight is just an awesome board game!

It allows you to experience some of the coolest things about RPGs in board game form... and that's really an impressing achievement! You get to go on adventures, exploring and advancing with your character, recruiting allies, gaining powerful spells and fighting dangerous monsters. Yet, if this theme wasn't supported by a solid set of mechanisms, I wouldn't like the game so much... just like I don't like other games that are all theme and no game-play (Arkham Horror, I'm looking at you).

Mage Knight instead has a very cool action card system, with some very innovative elements. It offers you a puzzle every turn, as you have to figure out how to chain your cards to achieve your goal. The designer really managed to combine theme and mechanisms here. Absolutely brilliant! Furthermore the amount of game in this box is HUGE: you can play competitive, cooperative, different characters and different scenarios!

This game would be a 10 for me, if it wasn't for a few issues that make the game less enjoyable in my opinion. First, the game has a very dense rule-set and I know that it's part of what makes this title so cool... but I know for a fact that, if a designer would tackle this game today, they would be able to streamline it a lot. The game could really use some, especially for the combat mechanics, where things get seriously counterintuitive. The game is already long as it is, but if you add the constant rule checking before attacking the toughest monsters, things get quickly out of hand. 

The other problem I have with the game - and this is very personal - is the same I had with other games from Vlaada Chvatil: the scoring. I cannot wrap my head around the scoring system and I'm not sure that it's really a fair one. However this doesn't bother me in Mage Knight as much as it would in a strategy euro game. Because, even if I lose, I can find enjoyment in everything that I achieved during the course of the game. Yet, it still bothers me a tiny bit when we count up the points.

Therefore, summing up, I really really enjoy Mage Knight. It's an exciting adventure game that let's you experience things you wouldn't imagine possible in board game form. It's a perfect marriage of theme and mechanisms and I always look forward to play it. Yet in my opinion it could use some streamlining. If it was a bit smoother, this would be one of my favorite games of all time. Still great though! Highly recommended!

Mage Knight is a very good game.  I've played a lot of games in a very saturated field (fantasy battle) and this one carves out a unique niche and carves it out very well.  It plays so smoothly from start to finish.  It manages to combine a board game with a Magic The Gathering feel (without having the break the bank on new cards) and deck building.  It has a great solitaire system built in, it can be played cooperatively and it can be played competitively.  

Complexity:  Don't let it scare you off!  It is far less complex than it has been made out to be.  The game teaches you how to play using a walkthrough while using the rules as a reference rather than something to read cover to cover.  There are also many tutorials on the net that will help.  The complexity lies in the strategy and how best to utilize your cards and resources.  

Demerits:  I see two that are worth mentioning.  First, the components are not great quality (as has been stated before).  The cards bend easily and the tiles warp and don't sit flush on the table.  This is a minor quibble, however.  Secondly, will this game get old quickly?  There are a limited number of scenarios and the game expansions don't add a ton of variety.  To be fair, I've only played solo so the game might play completely differently with other players (I suspect it does).  And also to be fair, it hasn't gotten "old" for me yet and I've been playing for a while so these two concerns may be baseless.

RATING: 9
FAVOURITE GAME - It is one of the heaviest boardgames I have encountered. It combines a lot of mechanics. The game is scenario based, of which there are only a few, but the randomness of the setup makes every gameplay totally different. You start with a hero venturing out and discovering new tiles with new monsters and locations to defeat and explore, to gain precious influence, to be able to upgrade, and get on to stronger enemies. The turn is card management: you draw a number of cards and then move and take an action as your cards allow it. The combat system is very nice and usually won`t give you a bloodless fight. The rules are many, the handbook is not the greatest but the game is quite immersive. Although it can support up to 5 players, it is advisable to play in 2-player mode, as it can take up hours exploring the seemingly petit kingdom.

Why I think you should play this:

*Mage Knight has a pedestrian theme. However, the generic narrative leaves a lot open-ended, and this assists in allowing you to build different characters different ways every time. Mage Knight is not an adventure game; it's a deck-building game with a fantasy theme. 

*This game has been called fiddly, but it shouldn't be compared to Euros. Instead, this is Magic Realm playable in an evening. When you read it in that vein, you see the economy of components and how enormous breadth has been contained in a pleasant and functional tactile experience.

*The gameplay is absorbing. [thread=864817]Beginner strategy here[/thread] and [thread=864916]Expert strategy here[/thread].

*Patrick Carroll makes a good distinction between 'god' and 'hero' games and in Mage Knight I think you are seeing the perfect blend. You are building your hero with personal customizations, but you are also above the game, manipulating it, not falling prey to the whims of chance. The world is randomly constructed but you control what you do in it. Definitely not an adventure game!

Why I might not recommend this:

*I play it exclusively as a solo experience and as a solo game this is definitively the best. I can see playing co-operatively with experienced players, but cannot see how this succeeds as a multiplayer game. The downtime issues are tremendous, and the options for conflict between players badly written up. I think for the time this takes to play, there are many, many better multiplayer conflict games.

Magic Realm lite?  Haven't played MR, but have learned a little.  This is very lite, but it's got more substance than any other "adventure" game I've played.  Not a dungeon crawler, but a card-game with character development, really.

Interesting, long, probably fairly deep (but luckish).

I played this 5 times at BGG Con 2011, even though it takes an eternity to play, which for me is a rarity.  Around 4-5 hours per play, and we were playing the 'shorter' two day scenarios like Blitz Conquest, with only 3 players.  About the only long games I like are this, Die Macher, and Through the Ages.  

The theme is excellent, and all of the game mechanics are exceptional.  I love the mana management, the deckbuilding, the hand management, and the wide variety of options available.  There are also tons of different scenarios, so you can tweak the game to your desires.   I love that you have options to do all sorts of things, even pillaging villages and burning down monasteries, and that these are sometimes or often good decisions, not just automatically terrible.  (Especially village pillaging, I feel is a critical part of strategy).

I ended up loving this game and wanting to repeatedly play it again, in spite of an enormous playtime, and thats extremely rare for me.


Update:  With 3 experienced players I've played Blitz conquest now in 3 hours.  Still too long but not by as much.

I initially adored this game, but after 80+ plays (many including the expansion) I've developed some gripes. I still love it because it's basically the only fantasy adventure game on the market that's not a crappy dice fest. The core is extremely well designed but the rough edges become more magnified with continued play.

My primary concern is that the competitive balance is skewed by the random factors. While there can certainly be a runaway leader problem, the games that annoy me more are the ones where you lose by only a few points because of how the monsters became distributed. Getting a grey guard in the white city is still only worth three points despite how hard it is to kill while someone else might draw a more vulnerable enemy and get more fame. I feel like the competitive game would be more meaningful if you had to win by a certain percentage of points. Honestly I don't mind that much because playing the game is really engaging and pleasant. I don't get actually annoyed at the table because of losing by a few points but I feel like it's a problem on a design level. However, it's enough to make me want to play co-op to the exclusion of competitive.

Norowas is notably more luck dependent than the other characters. He can be a beast or lag behind and you don't have a ton of say in the matter in some games. 

The game is too easy at the default difficulty and the random factors become too decisive at higher difficulty levels. You need to find your sweet spot.

The scenarios are hit and miss. Dungeon Lords in particular is probably the most "fun" because you get to play with a pile of artifacts and other powerful cards but it magnifies the runaway leader problem and sucks the joy out of the game. 

update: lowered from 9 to 8 because of general disinterest due to how much I've played this. You generally get into the same patterns and the competitive play isn't as sound as I'd like. This is still the best adventure game on the market but my tastes are moving in a different direction. This is my main fix for a big sprawling fantasy game with lots of bits.

One walkthrough play of the walkthrough scenario. 

First impression: Ghastly, horrid art and graphic design, on par with Runebound in that respect.

Second impression: Those rules aren't _that_ hard to swallow, wonder what's everybody complaining about? (Yes, I took my time with the game, didn't rush it, also I missed a few rules in my play, yet it took fewer visits to the BGG rules forum than usual to clear up the mysteries.) Maybe my dabbling in wargame territory has payed off in toughening me up somewhat in dealing with one of those a-big-pile-of-small-print rulesets?

Third impression: A game that never let's the player off the hook, involved and involving, a rich meaty dinner.

You can plan ahead quite a bit if you hang on to those cards, but it still doesn't feel overwhelming (at least on my beginner level of play... might change if you know the effect chains better)- you can still break it down into one puzzle per turn.

почитал вводные правила. судя по всему довольно сложная игра, но мне импонирует подход: автор понимает, что игра сложная, и не пытается это скрыть, а, напротив, постоянно это отмечает и делает скидку при объяснении правил. 

правила очень хорошо организованы: вводная повествовательная часть + полный систематизированный справочник. написано ясно, последовательно, с примерами не только о том, как сделать можно (и почему), а как нельзя (и почему). качественно. 

минусы навскидку: 
* некоторые механики нелогичны (для защиты от огненной атаки нужен ледяной щит; при этом, разумеется, на такую атаку действует fire resistance).
* нет совершенно никакой сюжетной части; многочисленные сценарии просто меняют стартовый расклад + вносят несколько особенностей. 

не уверен, что хочу заказывать, но если бы игра была - раскладывал бы сам с собой скорее всего.

Mage Knight seems to be universally beloved. It's too big of a game for this comment box to go over every single aspect in detail. This game feels like the designer dumped every board game they own out onto a table and stuck pieces in, then added rules ad-hoc to explain the pieces. The bloat in this game is measurably ridiculous. Someone should've taken it through several streamlining procedures before allowing it to go to print. 

Most of the mechanics feel thrown in "just because" and all of them feel incredibly restrictive. Movement is an absolute chore. Overall, it feels like it takes a huge design philosophy from DnD 3.5/PF without any of the editorial graces. Hugely prescriptive lists of specific rituals to get this or do that make the game feel like an elaborate masturbation ritual. You "do" a lot but don't get a lot "done". Wounds are yet another incredibly restrictive mechanic added into the game that compound your existing restrictions. Some may find the "new challenge every turn, let's McGuyver a solution from just this hand and a wad of bubblegum" vibe to be fun. Me and my group did not at all.

Most things in this game range from inefficient to useless, though a rare few cards/skills/units/whatever did feel about mid-powered. Monsters were just numbered tokens with no personality and several don't even move. The game is not even technically multiplayer. Players are all off doing their own thing on their turns, mostly ignoring each other completely. Very rarely do they interact and it's ALWAYS extremely bad. Usually for both of them. This is a solo game for 1-6 players, where you compare score at the end for no good reason. To that end, wounds essentially just prohibit your actions (read: make you lose entire turns, how fun) which only ultimately result in less win points at the end. 

I calculated it takes 16 strong move actions to traverse 8 map tiles in one game and you only get 20 possible turns in a 6-round game if you add cards at every round. Which you may not do since adding cards to the deck is, yet another prohibitively slow and difficult task. Cards that you add don't even feel more than 25% more powerful than your starting deck in most cases and in some cases feel the same or WORSE.  But in a game where you're lucky to get two-to-three strong move actions a round, getting across 8 tiles is incredibly difficult especially if you have to reveal half yourself. 

Combat is a whole can of worms. Aside from being a sterile affair of "play cards at it until it dies", range attacks happen first and are the only non-prohibitive way to kill something without taking massive wounds. Melee will basically just get you stacked with wounds after a while as you need to block the full amount of attack as well as have your own attack be the full amount of their HP. Or some combination of taking wounds and not killing it occurs. Don't get me started on defenses/resistances/fortifications which are all just the same thing only worded slightly differently so you have to turn the knob a few degrees to the left depending on which word was used...

There are almost no redeeming qualities in the game except the cute crystal pieces. Even the character roster is incredibly misogynistic. The ONE female character (of SIX) is a psychopathic blood-loving crazy person who wears almost no clothing. Overall this game is a hard pass for me and apparently very polarizing for other gamers from what user reviews have to say.

I was a fan of Hero Quest as a kid and I enjoyed it very much (even though I was the DM almost every time... grrr...) and when I tried Mage Knight I fell in love with it from the first sight! A very beautiful game with pre-painted figures of the Mage Knights all with their different powers, excellent artwork and a fantasy setting that has many elements of a euro game that makes the adventure not that frustrating with the constant rolling of dice and random events! Give this one some tries and it's going to reward you! With the expansion it's even better! The only drawback is that it lasts for too long.

RATING: 9.9
many plays: The only reason this isn't quite a 10 is because of the length, and the fact that I would rather play a conquest than any of the shorter scenarios (which are fun in their own right). But with the right people (or solo) and with time, it's incredible.

provisional rating after one solo play. I actually will be surprised if I play this with other people, since my gaming group has skewed light, and I literally cannot imagine the AP and downtime involved with a 4 player game with newbies. Good lord, my first solo game of conquest took me from 9:30 PM to 3AM (this seems insanely long, and I had just revealed my first city in the final night phase with no real hope of assaulting it). That being said, the game is fun as hell, trying to puzzle out what the best options are with the hand you draw each turn...feeling your power grow as you level up (I found a spell in a mage tower that let me recruit units for free from wherever!), truly sweet. Very glad I picked it up.

3/30/15
Revised up to 9.5 after an EIGHT HR solo conquest victory (168 pts wooot). I need to get faster, but the experience of making the best of your hand and growing in power is just sublime. 

edit#2: Played this 2p using the Druid Nights scenario, and we knocked it out in just over an hour. Having someone else there actually sped me up a bit I think, and having a better grasp on the game mechanics. It was a damn close game in terms of overall VP and he won only on achievement scoring after I took a huge lead during night #2. Still loving this

RATING: 6.5
It's a reasonably good game, though it falls short in a lot of ways that make me pretty sad.  At first it looked like a spiritual successor to Magic Realm, but gone is the sense of adventure and exploration - rather, it's a clean-ish puzzle game with decent theme where you play as a dude running around a map trying to level up and kill some cities or something.

Luckily, the core gameplay is solid.  Unfortunately, it takes forever - which is surprising, because there are significantly fewer important decisions than in other long games like TI3 or Civ.  The puzzle game core is very limiting, and while it's a fun enough puzzle game it never did impress me too much.

This floats somewhere between 6 and 7 I think.  It's a 7 when I really appreciate the overall mechanics, and then drops down to a 6 after I actually play it and remember that for all the good, it's ultimately disappointing.  An interesting core that was overdesigned into a sort of bland mess via specifics.  Regardless, the competitive rules make it more enjoyable and the puzzle itself is interesting, so that's a plus...

Mage Knight is a tough game to really collate my thoughts about. It's a tough game with a very steep learning curve. BUT, once you get though the 4 maybe 5 games it takes to EVEN LEARN the game it becomes simply amazing! It's an epic in every way! The feeling one comes to when one burns a monastery, lay waste to a city, delve a dungeon and roam across the lands purge all you see is simply brilliant! But the game can also be absurdly frustrating with the limitations, the overly complex rules, the limitations brought on by hands not giving you want you want and not having a good way to mitigate it.Its a game that does not feel consistent. Some games feel puzzle like and dull with horrible hands and lack of options, others feel like the world is ready to tremble below your heels. Mage Knight can be a very good game and one that scratches a very nice itch, but more than often its a complicated mess that outstays its welcome. Approach with caution, and give in to the game when you arrive.

Lost Legion expansion is great and had a lot of new possibilities.

Okay, so there is plenty of rules complexity, like nearly every Vlaada game there are all sorts of idiosyncracies and some corner cases and etc. (you can attack marauding orcs from one square away, but you must siege a keep by moving onto it). The rulebooks remain, as is Vlaada's trademark, pretty difficult to use as a reference.

But, still, I loved it. It was a great game. I've only done the intro Recon mission, which didn't introduce many of the advanced elements and, though it introduced spells, we never managed to get any spells, so it did feel like a very curtailed version of the game.

Still, this is a fascinating deck-builder. Every player has a (very slightly) different deck and different abilities. It's great because it makes your game and your deck individual, but isn't as prone to horrible "A Few Acres of Snow"-esque imbalance. There is a real, thematic flow to the game, and you actually do feel like you're doing what it says on the tin (exploring, fighting, and all that).

The basic action / enhanced (with mana) action deal is brilliant in combining a form of resource management with hand management. You actually feel like you can do something most every turn ... but just not quite enough. It's a really slick system.

The downsides are pretty apparent. The fiddliness is sometimes over the top: so, wait, when do I gain a reputation and when do I lose it? Oh, wait, can I even recruit this guy here? The rules, I reiterate, are tough to reference in-game. You don't get *quite* the same deck-building feel because (at least in the Recon mission) you cycle your deck so few times, meaning you get benefits from some cards only a few times. And then, everybody starts out with (nearly) the same deck and the opportunities to differentiate are sort of far in between (every other level you get a unique skill and advanced action) that it feels like you're playing similar games with just different draw orders.

Still, I'm being really critical. We had a lot of fun with this and time flew by while we were playing. This is top-shelf stuff and I'm eager to try it again.

Mage Knight confirms that long fantasy adventure games are not for me.  Whenever the playing time edges over two hours (and Mage Knight goes way over that), I'd always sooner play an RPG.  The rinse and repeat of move, kill monster, gain allies over four or five hours simply isn't enough to hold my attention.  

At first glance, Mage Knight does add an interesting deck building element to traditional fantasy adventure elements.  It allows wounds to be handled nicely by adding useless cards to your deck.  However, I found how the deck operates in practice not to my liking.  Here is my fearsome warrior unable to slay a puny orc because...I currently have a hand full of movement and influence cards.  And my deck cycles slowly, so I can spend a while standing next to that orc, doing nothing.  That may simulate that I'm not actually very fearsome, but I prefer a system that gives me a chance to do something, albeit at low odds.  Colour me Ameritrash, I guess. The limitations imposed by the mana/crystal  system seemed to work better.  Victory point scoring for a variety of things struck a bum Euro-efficiency note with me; I find complete the quest/kill the ultimate monster sorts of goals much more satisfying. 

As in many adventure games, there is a fair bit of down time.  I wouldn't play again with more than three players.

The pre-painted miniatures are quite nice and the tiles and cards are all good quality.  I found the artwork pretty undistinguished.  None of it creates an impression of a non-generic fantasy world.  Some of the iconography on counters is quite hard to see.

Epic adventure game. I like the deck building aspect of it. Battles are like mini puzzles (typical in Vlaada's games) I also like the heroes pre-painted miniatures. More complex, offering many things to do and less luck driven than other popular adventure games. Includes co-op , competitive and player vs player scenarios. The game lasts more that 3 hours. Not recommented with 4 players because of the downtime.

RATING: 7.5
Game length and fiddliness make this hard to play. I have still never even tried the PvP combat, it's too daunting. 

What I played of this game was very enjoyable, although there is a lot of randomness and not a very strong deck-building feel (despite how the game was billed to me) I really enjoy the combination of Eurogame and Twinkfest MMORPG that's happening here.

This is a deck-building game I like, as there's lots to think about in how to use your cards to achieve what you want (though still the frustrations when the right cards don't turn up)-- very strong and arresting theme, lots to explore, I'm excited to play more-- there's a lot to learn and figure out about what kind of deck you want and how to get there. Can be very slow with lots of downtime, though you tend to be planning your next move on others' turn; so not so much table talk, it's really quite cerebral.

Luckily this game works very well solo. Otherwise you need a dedicated group of players over several play sessions to really get your money's worth.

Biggest draw back is the time needed to play this game.

The few times I was able to play it outside solo I had to spend the time just teaching how to play, running through the tutorial. 

I really need to get the "Lost Legion" expansion to bring more to the table especially in solo mode.

RATING: 8
I've only played a handful of games solo, but it's already on of my favorites. High on strategy, low on luck - this one will give your brain a good workout, if you play it properly. I am not a huge fan of deckbuilding games outside of MtG, but this combo of deckbuilding and board game really struck a chord with me.

Pros:
Gameplay
Modular board
Replayability
Artwork
Pre-Painted mini's / pawns and Components (except for the cards)
Walkthrough rulebook and separate full rulebook.

Cons:
Rules could be written much better. They make is seem much more complex then it is (Arkham Horror is much harder to work, IMO).

Cards - The art is good, but the card stock is flimsy and on the cheap end. By my 2nd play, I already had the print on the back of a few cards start to slough off. This is rather bad, considering the cards will be the most used and handled component. I'm not one to sleeve cards, usually, but I HIGHLY recommend sleeving this one. I only hope WizKidz steps up and makes the cards to be a bit more sturdy in later prints.

Warnings:
Length - I like the length for solo play, but I can already see that playing this with 4 or 5 players will take a great deal of time. (45 mins to an hour per player)

It may not be for everyone, but I love it.

This is a provisional rating after one game. It impresses with the painted minis and with the way the map is built, it has quite nice mechanics and I cannot wait to play it again. This is a game worth discovering

EDIT: After 5 games (a few solo included), the rating stays. The game has a lot to offer, an epic feeling and enough strategic choices. 
The only cons are the length of the game and the fact that after a few play you have already seen everything the game has to offer.

An excellent fantasy RPG board game. A short and concise rulebook is needed because you get lost in the actual ones when search for details. This game provide good complexity and great strategies but with the cost of many hours spent. Is not so easy to learn and have many exceptions hard to find in rulebook... searching will eat time too, but when learned to be played offer many satisfactions and good feeling. 
Conclusion: need 10-20 games to learn to play it well and without time dragging. Rating goes from 9.5 - 9.6 up to full 10 after only 8 plays!
In fact the only regret is that it don't play a bit faster and this keep this wonderful game out of the table considering that few friends have so much time to spend with a single game session. Play best with 1-3 players.
 
Best style of play: competitive without PvP.
Is the kind of game you'll love more with the every new session of play. And if you keep it away a while you'll miss not playing it.

Plays status with expansion included: 
- starting scenario with 5 players - 6+ hours
- played in 2 and 3 players a blitz conquest and game took around 4-6 hours.
- full conquest (2players) - 6+hours
- played mines liberation (2 players) - 5+hours
- played dungeon lords scenarios (2players) -6+ hours(Obs.: a blitz variant work if you exclude all non-dungeons,village,monasteries green tiles and you put red enemies only on core tiles secret tombs, brown on countryside tiles even near monasteries or you'll have to fight red monsters at the start of the game)  
Is nice that you have variety in choosing from few different kind of scenarios with different goals.

Amazing experience! Is a game that you'll dream playing if you don't play it. Have somehow the feeling of Heroes of Might&Magic or King's Bounty on a board.

This game is so slow..... It just isn't fun to spend hours in a 4 player game doing nothing before quitting because it still isn't over. Level up is lack luster. Movement is painfully slow. Parallel play rather than co-op. Movement is so slow you couldn't even get to the other players to help them if they needed it! No heroic feelings. In fact I don't even get how this is thematic. Really wanted to like it, but after 5-6 plays just don't. Even bought the expansions. I would have a riot on my hands IF I wanted to play it again. Which I do NOT! I have no desire to even try it solo. Not sure how this gets such high ratings.

Played 3 times solo. One introductory scenario, and 2  conquest solo.

Pros
-Diverse. All 3 games played out very differently. 

-Solid as a puzzle game. There doesn't seem to be a way to "break" the game.

-Good solo. As a result of the first two points above.

-Many options. This is a mixed blessing. I like the calculation part but it may lead to AP with the wrong crowd.

Cons
-Ridiculous battle mechanics. (not to mention ANTI-THEMATIC).

-Deck building is tertiary to the game, although pronounced by everyone in bgg. Also it doesn't help immersion.

-Very fiddly.

-Very long game. Needlessly so as a result of the point above. A solo can last 3 hours including setup which is too long for what actually transpires in the game. 

-Unnecessarily random at crucial points especially unit offer. I suppose that this will become a factor in PvP.

-[b]Very bad manual.[/b] It is one of the worst organized rules book that I've ever read. The split rules are a mixed blessing. Sometimes they help sometimes they confuse. I acknowledge the help they provide to the newbie but at the end it doesn't help the same newbie to master the game.

Conclusion: Don't believe the hype. This game is good but not that good. I don't think it deserves it's top 10 status.

I am beginning to like it more and more. It still has defects but at least it is rewarding and diverse. Bumped from 7 to 8.

MageKnight is a huge complicated beast that will be true love for a certain crowd. I am not one of that crowd for a couple reasons, but I still want to do it justice because it's such an interesting design. 

Pros: the open modular nature of the board, the dual-mode cards, and to a lesser degree the magic system are innovative and appealing. Add to that the inherent joy of RPGs (leveling dudes and upgrading decks is super fun) and you have a formula for a great time. If long, heavy RPGs with in-depth rules systems appeal to you (maybe you played a lot of Baldur's Gate back in the day and really enjoyed the character min-maxing) MK is probably your jam. 

Cons: there are two main obstacles between me and that jam. First, I'm turned off by lazy, generic fantasy art, and Wizkids is a repeat offender. The board tiles themselves are fine, but many of the card illustrations are just ugly, literalist art ("Promise" is an image of two armored fists shaking hands, etc). Add to that the uninspired theme (blah blah, kill some orcs) and the requisite chainmail bikinis and the product is a game that doesn't inspire me as a mature adult gamer. If you played Baldur's Gate for the storyline and artistry, this will turn you off. 

The second issue is more arguable: the game has a few too many interconnected rules systems layered on top of one another to seem entirely coherent. To some this is the grand beauty of Vlaada's design, but to me this just seems busy and an unnecessary barrier to entry. Too many "bells and whistles" distracting from the core of the game; I'd prefer something a little more streamlined. Day/night is the perfect example: it's kind of interesting from a design perspective, but I don't feel it is a necessary addition to the game's complexity. 

To sum up, this is an RPG for the strategy wonk in the room who could care less about aesthetics and design elegance. For me, I'd rather be playing Imperial Assault, Gloomhaven, or just D&D...

Mage Knight finds itself in the opposite plane of existence within my board game collection, as opposed to T.I.M.E. Stories - while I complain about the latter in terms of my perception of its lack of strategy and meaningful decisions (which as I note in my comment about that game is caused by my misconception of that game and how it is supposed to be played, but I have yet to try it again with the correct mindset) - I have issues with this game itself in terms of just how much tactical focus exists and how it really slows down the game and drags it on without any real excitement to it.

Echoing one of the reviews of this game (of which I read tons and watched a lot of videos before purchasing it), I really wanted to like this game considering the investment I had put into it in terms of time and money, but I find myself unable to. I played it solo and with a friend, and I just find that I am hyper-optimising my play without any real interest in why I am doing it - I am doing it for the sake of doing it, because that is what the game requires of me.

You are going to be frustrated. Because this game is hard and complex. Mind you it is still fun. The components are awesome with beautiful artwork on the tiles and well painted minis to boot. But there are just sooooooo many mechanisms you are trying to keep track of. A very slow deck building aspect combined with dice rolling, hand management and host of others. There is even a dummy player for 2-player game (though it isn't as bad in this game and just acts as a timer) There is an exploration aspect to this game that we love as we uncover new locations and enemies. That part we love. But that brings us to the part we loathe. The combat in this game is just too fiddly to keep up with. The rule book even advises you that you should ask other players for help in combat. So Vlaada has made an awesome gamers version of a fantasy adventure game. But maybe we just aren't gamers enough for it.

Just picked this game up because I saw it used for 1/2 price.  I've had my eye on it for a while because it's such a good game in solo mode, even though I have issues with it as a multiplayer experience.

Considering that I'm only allowed to buy one game this year as part of a pledge, it's a little weird that I would choose this one, since it's not one of my favs.  Dunno, it was some kind of a weird compulsion.

Se trata de un Eurogame "camuflado" como juego de aventuras. Las acciones vienen determinadas por la eficiencia de tu baraja y no se tiran dados. Básicamente debes saber administrar las cartas de tu mano para sacar el máximo partido a cada uno de tus turnos. Existe un componente de exploración y otro de aventura pero a diferencia de juegos como Runebound aquí se tiene un mayor control de la situación y muchas veces estás planeando tu turno actual pensando en que debes guardarte tal carta para utilizarla dentro de un par de turnos.
El sistema de juego es bastante propenso al AP y la partida puede hacerse muy larga cuando no se tiene demasiada experiencia.

Update #2 - Logged about 5 solo plays, 2 of them with the Vassal Engine and this game gets even better!  This is my favorite game to play solo and with an online version, I can do it while on the road and don't need 2 tables to play the game :-D.  I think it is definitely best played with 1-2 players.  Updated to a 10!


Update #1 - Played one more game solo and it was fantastic. Going to move it to a 9, pending 10 on replay-ability and then multi-player games.  I feel like I may not like the competitive world, but the co-op would be fun.

I love Vlaada Chvatil so much, but unfortunately I think that it suffers from three main problems

#1 Runaway leader
#2 Complexity of rules
#3 Time to play

Best. boardgame. ever. Every game is different. Every minute of Mage Knight is an adventure full of possibilities. It feels like a storybook filled with discoveries and treasures and monsters to kill, AND it can be played cooperatively! *swoon* 

There are so many things to do on every turn, so many ways to accomplish your goals. And even if things don't work out as planned/desired, there are other ways to move forward. What else? Oh, yes: I love the artwork. One caveat: the mana "crystals" in the box are cheap and ugly, but I bought my own and now I'm happy. 

Mage Knight is fairly complex and it did take me a while to learn how to play, but the effort definitely paid off. I can't get enough of this game. If I could give Mage Knight an 11, I would.

This is the best adventure game, hands down.  It lacks the chaos commonly found in the genre, which allows for medium to long term planning.  While the gameplay can be a little bit like solving a series of puzzles and not like adventuring around the countryside, the mechanics never fail to create an interesting set of puzzles to solve.  Strategic questions (i.e. what cards to add to your deck) nicely complement the turn-to-turn cardplay decisions.

Some really neat ideas put together into a fun game. I am not the happiest with the bits matched with the price, but so far in my solo plays, the game design matches the price. Played with multiple players it tends to be a semi tight race for the end. Lots of good times in this box... Several more 2 player games later, this is one of the best game I have ever played. The only thing that hurts it is the length. A treasure!

RATING: 8
Awesome concept, brilliant design, but lots of fiddly rules that strike me as unnecessary.  I'm generally quite tolerant of fiddly rules when they serve a purpose (e.g., as a balancing mechanism or for historical accuracy in a simulation/wargame), but I feel like Mage Knight has a lot of extra rules & exceptions that don't really add much to the experience.

Reviews of Mage Knight are common, but a few of my friends asked me to share my thoughts on the game. So, here they are! I'll update this review after a few more games, if I feel it's necessary. I'll mostly be talking about the *feel* of the game, which I don't expect to change.

This review is for gamers newish to the tabletop scene who are interested in diving headfirst into something complex and magical.

**First Impressions**

Mage Knight is a heavy game. The first thing you'll see when you open the box are two rulebooks - One is a walkthrough, the other is a reference guide. Both seem pretty great, but they're a little confusing when it comes to combat. I recommend printing off a few of the guides from the BGG Files page for quick reference.

The introductory walkthrough does a great job of helping you set up the game step-by-step. It introduces the mechanics to you *as they come along*, instead of all at once up front. You don't even draw some of the cards you can eventually buy until you reveal a certain tile in the first game, so there's that much less to wrap your head around.

**Components**

The game has four minis for your heroes and four minis for the cities you discover in the game. The cities are neat, but the heroes are *rad*. The paint and figure quality on the heroes is spectacular.

The monster tokens are cardboard punch-out tokens, *but* they're already punched and in a nice little plastic tray with a clear plastic lid for storage. They have a good enough weight and feel to them, and they're easy to place onto and remove from the board.

The hex tiles feel about as solid as any Twilight Imperium or Catan piecies.

Everything fits in the box *just so*, with no extra room for cards to shift around. Note, if you sleeve your cards, they won't fit in the insert.

**Gameplay**

It's awesome, but it's complex as hell. The gameplay is fun, it takes forever, and it's intense. When you figure out how to overcome an obstacle with the resources you have, it feels like you just finished a puzzle. Scraping by a monster by the skin of your teeth at the beginning of the game makes smashing strong enemies with powerful abilities later in the game *incredibly* satisfying.

It feels like an adventure RPG video game mixed with a tabletop D&D session and a deckbuilder card game.

**Time**

I played the "First Reconnaisance" mission, the walkthrough scenario, over the course of three days. I was able to leave the game set out on our dining room table, and it was easy to pick up and play for an hour or so each day.

This is a game you'll need to set aside a big chunk of time for a full scenario, at least a few hours. I've heard that each added player (up to four) significantly increases playtime.

**Experience as a new player**

I just barely beat the introductory scenario, which is focused on exploration and teaching you the mechanics of the game. 

The rampaging enemies were tough to beat at the beginning of the game, but I managed to defeat two enemies at once while exploring ruins by the final round. This game gives you a real sense of progression, as you add stronger cards to your deck and more units to your command.

I ended up with one movement tile still unexplored, and I hadn't found The City yet. I had just exhausted the dummy player's deck, which meant the game was over at the end of my turn. I managed to use the last of my resources and my last available unit to discover the final tile and reveal The City. 

I spent around ten minutes putting the cards and pieces back in the spots and set the box on the shelf. I already want to take down the box again and start my next adventure.

**Thoughts**

If you like fantasy-themed video games and books, if you like tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons or Twilight Imperium, and if you have a great deal of patience; I recommend this game. 

I paid around $65 after shipping from an online store, and a local game store has it in stock for about $80. After my first playthrough, I think $80 would have been a reasonable price for the game. I can already tell it's going to give me hours, maybe days, of enjoyment. I'm looking forward to sharing the game with my friends, and I look forward to rainy days at home with this game sprawled across my table.

------------------------------

FIRST REVIEW
This game is flippin' gorgeous. The minis, the tiles, the cards, everything looks and feels solid. Even the rulebooks feel like they're printed on high-quality paper, and there are two of 'em! A walkthrough for the first playthrough, and a rulebook for reference.

I started the tutorial mission, and my confidence in the size of my table wilted with each newly placed component. This game has a sprawl factor, I think.

I'll write a full review once I've got a few plays under my belt, but so far - This game seems amazing.

RATING: 7
Leading off with a 7 after two 2P plays of the intro scenario, which means the rating is hardly conclusive.  I like it, and think it could be great for those that can really dedicate time to it.  For me, it's harder to picture getting lots of value out of it with infrequent play, especially with requisite rules consulting.  It's also hard for me to picture enjoying it with more than 2P because of the potential downtime.  I think I like it a good deal more than Prophecy, and could actually see enjoying an epic length playing of it.  Hope to read the rules myself and revisit soon, while the iron is still hot.  I consider it an adventure game with a splash of deckbuilding, which kind of surprised me given the emphasis on the deckbuilding aspect.  I could see that coming a bit more into play on longer scenarios, but still not a lot of churn and zero (AFAIK) shaping.  If it sounds remotely interesting, I highly recommend trying it with 2P.

First of all, I see a lot of people comparing this to Heroes of Might and Magic. Well, I would say it's more along the lines of a King's Bounty : the Legend, not that it matters a lot but here you don't have to manage a castle, so don't get that wrong...
That being said, this is an absolutely great game that proves once again the ability of Vlaada C. to create so many different quality games.

RATING: 10
Played two times first-reconnaissance and three times solo conquest. All the games played were solitaire games and I really enjoyed all of them. I find this game quite entertaining and challenging in every turn, though I also find quite difficult to play it right according to the rules because of the little nuances that it has in each and every situation of the game. I don't think I have completed any of the games I've played without making several mistakes along the way ... that isn't a bad thing about the game ... just a consequence of its complexity, and it will take some time and several games to get to play it right, and it can be a bit frustrating at first ... either way ... I like it very much!! 

Edit: My Mage Knight box came with no mana dice. I wrote to Wizkids and almost the next week the seven mana dice were knocking at my door eager to start playing, very fast and unexpectedly efficient delivery!
By far this is my favourite game to play solo, and also my favourite game at the moment.

One of the designs of Vlaada Chvátil that I like the least. The rules themselves have some fiddly and counter-intuitive elements. The rulebook is put together in a way that makes these elements even harder to comprehend in the flow of the game. I keep on thinking "there is something awesome under this crushing game." Then I see other games that just might do it better like runescape or Descent.

Mage Knight is one of the most komplex games out there. But once you have understood the rules and possibilities it's a very immersive play. Especially that the characters gain levels and abilities is a very nice part of the game.
The material (a multitude of cards, thick plates and miniatures) is also very nice. 
Only reason it has missed 10 stars for me is the duration of a turn; if another player ponders his move thorougly it can easily take 20 minutes.

Pros:
-Very high replayability
-Good quality components
-Lots of tactics, builds and strategies to try
-Big amount of gameplay options: solo play, cooperative or competitive, several scenarios, with or without PvP...
-The theme is very well integrated in the game
-Great game out of the box
-Feels and plays very differently from other "epic fantasy" games
-The variable map is very well thought

Cons:
-Very complex rules with lots of "exceptions" to remember, even without considering questions between card combos.
-Step learning curve. 
-Runaway leader in competitive scenarios
-Potentially very long sessions with lots of waiting time between turns. If you dont like to wait watching the other players perform their actions, this game is not for you
-Needs a big table

Excellent game that I love to play and I struggle to play :D

Not so much a deckbuilding game as a Fantasy Card-Driven game (i.e. CDG wargame).  sure, your deck will get some additions in the course of the game, but mostly this is about the interaction of what you -want- to do versus what your hand of cards allows you to do.  Do you play inefficiently to accomplish a plan, or play tactically to maximize efficiency?

sure, there's lots of rules, special abilities, icons, etc.  you won't grasp it all immediately, and will probably make mistakes.

The fiddly  rules have prevented me from enjoying this game as much as I might wish to.  And having played Mage Wars, with its easy entre into the game and fun element of spellbook building, poor Mage Knight is being relegated to the very top shelf of the closet, reserved for the 'waiting for someone to ask to play' shelf. My gaming group hasn't.

The best solo game, certainly. And a simply great avatar game, once again with great progression from barely being able to stomp on orcs to defeating cadres of archmagi, towering dragons and cities full of elementals. Doesn't work well for more than two players - too much downtime, which is part of why the solo game is good - it's all up time. I find that I like deck building more if it's feeding other gameplay elements, exactly as happens here.

After a year of my friends claiming that this was one of the best games out there, I finally tried it tonight.

Gets a pretty big yawn from me.

That's not say it's a bad game, but it's very solitaire oriented, and very long. Lots of randomness - so your win/loss is determined more about what you draw than what you do to win.

Would rather play pretty much anything else, but could probably be talked into it once in a blue moon.

My favorite designer has put together another winner. While the high fantasy theme of Mage Knight is a fairly  dull, run-of-the-mill, orc-fest -- the game itself is epic.

Most of the stuff we see in this genre is either a dungeon crawl (like decent), or some sort of Magic: The Gathering clone.

Mage Knight tells a much broader tale.  Instead of trudging through a dungeon or engaging in some sort of spell-slinging wizard duel, you trudge through multiple dungeons and sling many spells.  You also raise your own army or followers and can even burn down the occasional monastery just for fun.

There are several Vlaada trademarks in this design.  One of which is his tendency to resolve critical gameplay moments with a kind of puzzle solving rather than a die role.  The plus side is that it can be very satisfying to play your hand of cards in just the right way as to move to the wizard tower and defeat the guardian there, while still having enough left over to bank a mana crystal for the next round.

The downside is that sometimes there are moments in the game that lose their dramatic punch as everything has already been worked out by the time it's your turn.  It's one thing to see a battle hinge on that critical die roll it's another to have the maths already in your pocket and have it all just "work out".

Still there is so much variety and strategic opportunities in this game that it really deserves your attention.  It's a true exploration game done right(much like High Frontier actually), where you really feel like you are earning every new encounter, every spell, every artifact.

Warning:  This is best explored first on your own (a few solo rounds will be really helpful), and then probably with one other experienced player.  Don't dive into a 4-player game with all newbies.

Az utóbbi évek egyik legsikeresebb szerzőjének egyik legsikeresebb játéka... nekem mégsem annyira jött be. A szerzőnek szinte minden ismertebb játékát jobbnak érzem, de tény, hogy műfajilag ez áll tőlem legtávolabb. Elismerem, hogy a játék tényleg nagyon össze van rakva, de ebben nem érzem azt az átütő eredetiséget, mint a TTA-ban, a Dungeonokban, vagy a Space alertben. A szerző szerintem minden témában tudna egy működőképes és viszonylag komplex játékrendszert alkotni, és még csak nem is a megszokott paneleivel (néhány kivételtől eltekintve)... de ezen a játékán kicsit azt éreztem, mintha megrendelték volna tőle, hogy legyen egy ilyen típusú is. Egyébként sokszor újrajátszható, többféle játékmód van (kooperatív, felfedező, egymás elleni...), szépen meg van csinálva, de szerintem nem nagyobb durranás, mint mondjuk az Odalent. Ráadásul baromi hosszú a szabály, és maga a játék is elnyúlhat. Nekünk (igaz, hogy 1. parti volt) 1 napszak majdnem másfél óráig tartott, és egy hosszabb küldetés 6 napszakból áll. Elpakolni se két perc, de a doboza nagyon dicséretes, ugyanennyi tartalommal általában 2-3-szor ekkora dobozokban adnak ki egy játékot! Én egyébként egyre kevésbé szeretem azokat a sok kellékes játékokat, ahol azt érzem, hogy a rengeteg féle jelölő meg pakli öncélú. Ez is kicsit ilyen. Maga a pakliépítés és paklikezelés viszont rendben van. Ami negatívum: a holtidő már 3 fővel is nagy volt sajnos. A szerencse szerepéről: egyikünk végig a rossz lapjárásra panaszkodott, a végén viszont egy jó lapkahúzással kb. megduplázta a pontjait, és nyert is. Nem is tudom... mindenképp játszani kell még vele. Érdekes, de nem látom még, hogy miért top 10...és miért top1 tematikus játék.
---
Egyet aludtam rá, végül úgy döntöttem, az Odalent-tel megegyező pontszámot kap. Először kevesebbet adtam, de végül is kb. az a szint. Az Odalent valamiért nekem kicsit nagyobbat ütött, talán mert az volt az első ilyesmi, amit próbáltam. Kár, hogy már nem adok fél pontokat, most indokolt lett volna... Amúgy mindkettővel kellene még játszanom.

This is a fixed fun game, so I'm much more likely to play it solo or with two. Rating falls a bit with each player, so I rate this 10 as a solo game, 9-10 with 2, 7-8 with 3. I haven't tried it with four. 

Update -- Since I've played 150+ times (most logged under expansion), I'm just calling this a 10.

Rating -- Enthusiastic (solo). Suggest (2 players). With 3+ it's an every once in a while.

An excellent adventure game, and by far the best there is! A vivid world is offered for exploration; the main mechanic of the game offers great possibilities.
Many ways to utilize your cards and your mana make for plentiful strategies and depth. Each round is both a beautiful puzzle and a small decision. Brilliant! colourful!
The game is also excellent as an adventure game that realises its creative fantasy world through both theme and mechanics.
A must have for every boardgamer.
In the expansion I'd like even more enemies, complex wounds, and most needed are new map tiles with even more new features to make the world of mage knight really vast.

edit:
I am now convinced that Vlaada Chvatil is an advanced alien that has come to astonish us with his innovations, though instead of inventing the cure for cancer, the bastard makes boardgames!

RATING: 5
I know I'm really going against the grain here but I can't believe how highly ranked this game is.  I can see why someone would like it, it's not awful.

First, I don't think the mechanisms in this game are thematic at all.  I'm so surprised people see this as a thematic game.  Imho it is completely abstract.  I never felt like I was attacking an orc or assaulting a mage tower.  I was just doing the math before making my move and then, well, not doing that action if the math didn't add up.  So no suspense

Second, what's the reward for putting in all the work? I didn't feel like I conquered anything.  If a mage knight's job is to read a rule book over and over again just to find out that nope, i can't beat that dungeon, and then waste my time moving 2 spaces instead, then wait 20 minutes to go again, I don't want to be a mage knight.

Third, I didn't feel any strategy, everything is tactile.  Now that would normally be fine but to make tactile mechanisms so difficult to learn is just cruel.  It's fun to boggle the brain with the "why" of doing something (strategy) but to melt my brain with the question of how I can accomplish simple actions is just plain wrong.

In short, boy am I glad I rented this before buying.  ALL HYPE

although if you love this game, that's cool too!

Wow, I am amazed. Vlaada is without any doubt the most versatile games designer around.

I normally hate adventure games, because they usually are boring dicefests where one goes around killing everything he ecounters. So, a long (very long) adventure game is one of the less likely games I would possibly like.

But I absolutely love Mage Knight.

It has theme, it has replayability, it has very small doses of luck, it can be played cooperatively or competitively. Furthermore, one can do good or evil deeds, and both have consequences!

This is a great, innovative design. It puts the deckbuilding mechanic inside a true game (the only other design doing that is A Few Acres of Snow), but there is also much more to love: the mana management is so clever, the day/night alternance is brilliant, the tactics card are another touch of great design...

Mage Knight would be on my personal top10 if it would be a shorter game. BUT, would a shorter Mage Knight have the same appeal?
Don't know, but if it can stand another handful of plays retaining the same level of excitement, it would enter the top10 anyway...

Update july 14, 2012: after 10 games, the awesomeness of Mage Knight strikes me even more! What a wonderful masterpiece! I even had a couple solo plays (and I normally don't care playing solo...) and they were amazing! Now I am convinced the game needs its length to be so epic... if only I'd be able to squeeze some more games in my tight timetable...
Rating upgraded to 9.5!

Update february 25, 2013: after more than 25 plays, I am fully convinced that this game needs to be at the top. The only game of this lenght and complexity I ever rate this high. It's a 10!

Like the idea that the miniatures come painted. This versus the plain grey miniatures that most games give, put Mage Knight in a way better light.

The gameplay is also very interesting as it mirrors the way a deck is build in a CCG environment. Basically each character starts with a deck with "commons" and "uncommons" and we are trying to improve the deck further by having "rares" which are obtained after completing each quests, learning at the monastery or killing the monsters.

Unfortunately my wife totally neg'd on this game. Something about it was completely uninteresting to her. Too bad because I really liked the theme. I tried playing out a solo mission to see what that was like but when it comes down to it I just don't like playing solitaire very much. I'll probably trade this away since it gets ZERO time on the table. Sad.

UPDATE: I ended up trading it away. I'm not wealthy enough to have any games in my collection just for the sake of having them.

RATING: 9
Known as one of the premier solo games, the divisive Mage Knight can be difficult to learn and is best approached with long-term commitment in mind. There are lots of rules and the gameplay is not always obvious, but with a patient approach the game will yield its subtle rewards. Once you understand how it works, it is not exceedingly complex; and if you continue to play often, you will be able to retain the necessary information rather easily. It's a multi-faceted adventure that is wholly engaging. It's a great game for getting your mind off of your troubles because it invariably commands your full attention; I never find myself losing interest, and the time tends to fly by. If anything, be on guard against analysis paralysis, and figuring out your turn can be a brain-burning process at times (perhaps another reason why this game really shines in solo play). One drawback to the game is that it can feel rather mechanical, as stories do not tend to develop as much as fantasy fans may prefer; there are no events at all, and though encounters are random, the particular enemies that show up are rather inconsequential thematically. Know thyself -- if you can handle the barrier of entry and you enjoy the mechanical process of maximizing your efficacy and building combos, you will be rewarded with a rich, fulfilling experience. This isn't a game to pull out on a whim every couple of months -- the more you invest in Mage Knight on a regular basis, the more you'll get out of it.

RATING: 9
Having a difficult time scoring this game... I give it a 9/10 based solely off of my impressions of it as a solo game.  It is a great game and probably my favorite solo game at the moment.  There is a lot to keep track of, but it is manageable as things flow accordingly.  This game isn't a game that you are going to play correctly or without looking things up on your first several plays, but don't let that discourage you.

I just dove in and played after watching some videos and skimming through the walkthrough.  I later learned I made some mistakes, but it allowed for me to understand the game some so when I read through the walkthrough again, it made much more sense and was easier to grasp what was going on.

I recommend this game anyone that is looking for a deep game that takes up a lot of time and to those that think they would enjoy a puzzle like adventure with a bit of D&D type theme as well.  I recommend people take advantage of BGG and all the resources they have available for the game as it makes it easier to follow and learn.

This is a game I'm enjoying more and more with each play.  It is definitely not for anyone that does not like a rules heavy game.

After numerous plays and after having played many other games, I'm upgrading my initial rating from a 9 to a 10.

Score is going back down to a 9 because it is too demanding, time wise.

And now sold, just didn't make it to the table enough, and as a primarily solo game it just doesn't make sense to hold onto it.

Ok,
I finally got this game. Bring it on!

Edit after 8 plays: I remember this game to be more exciting. It is a puzzle, and it turns out I don't like solitaire games that much. 
As a solitaire, I really enjoy it. I play one round, and then immediately start playing the next one. But I would always swap a Mage Knight session solo for a multiplayer game (Agricola, Runewars, even Castles of Burgundy).
As a thematic game, the first time I played it (not my copy), I thought it's the most thematic game ever. Because it has orcs, dragons, resistances, cities, etc. However, after trying Robinson Crusoe, Mage Knight seems almost abstract, with a pasted on theme. The game doesn't react to your actions in the thematic way as Robinson did (You have diarheea now because two turns before you ate a dead goat).
Also, the game has soooo many rules. I still have the manuals near me, and I consult them several times per session. The playtime is long, but it is a good investment for an epic feel after a session.

Now the paradox: although the game is convoluted and with so many rules, I won 6 out of 8 sessions (and other 2 games with Goldyx I have abandoned, I am still figuring this guy out, his skills are sub-par in my opinion). The ease with which I won this games (city level 4) made me wonder about this game solo replayability. I won with Arythea, and this bitch is just awesome and easy to play. I won with Torvak, and this guy is a little clunky, and lacks firepower. However he is great defensively, and can take a lot of abuse. Unfortunately, that doesn't help him to kill monsters and conquer cities, which you ultimately have to do.
After walking over level 4 cities as a simple breeze, I tried to increase difficulty to level 5 and 8. I lost. Then, downgraded 2nd city to 5. And I was wining easily. Until I tried Goldyx. This guy has bad skill, or I just don't know how to play him. From 4 attempts, I abandoned 3 games as hopeless, and won another in the last tour of the last night. That was a close call for sure, as I had to conquer 2 cities in just one night. Fortunately I was stoked with powerful spells, powerful allies, powerful Advanced actions, artifacts and crystals. It was a force showcase.
And now, I am playing my 5th session... with Goldyx. This game has something, that you want to play one more turn. Sign of a good game? Perhaps. 
Overall, Mage Knight is a frustrating affair for me. It is not the kind of game where you have light fun, like let say... Arcadia Quest, where you kill some monsters and have fun. But the difficulty of the game also makes it very good as solo game. And that alone will keep it in my collection, as I totally lack solo games. I still have a lot of content to explore in this game , as I have played only solo conquest scenario   up to now.

Mage Knight made me realise that I'm not a huge Vlaada Chvatil fan. He has some very good ideas, but his games seems to be bloated with additional ideas, chits, cards and things to remember.

Very glad I bought it.

RATING: 5
Euro dungeon crawl at its finest.  Battles are determined by making the most efficient card combo. The lands are arranged to get harder as you advance so skipped content doesn't usually get revisited. The only flavor are cards with generic fantasy names and the finely crafted prepainted minis you most efficiently move around with. Doing good and evil tasks are only based on what is most efficient. I had no difference in feelings between burning a monastery down versus saving a village, just whatever gave the max loot and VP reward.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First Play: We all pre-read the rules watched the videos and were ready to hit the ground running. However the game slowed to a crawl immediately. Every turn needed cross reference to the rules over wording or meaning and not all the rules are in one book so each turn was tortuously slow. As a result the down time between turns was massive. Combine that with the fact that you have no idea what move the player next to you will take so you cannot pre-plan with any confidence.

The cards predictably dont fall pat so I found myself unable to move to my desired location, unless I burnt the cards I needed to use when I got there. Once in the night phase the mana dice turned rapidly black and single coloured so I literally could not use enhanced benifits on any deed cards.

All in this was the epitome of frustration. A tedious experience of waiting for your turn and then not being able to do what you would like to (at all). And way way too long.

I am told this is the pain you must endure to reach the inner beauty of the game. That maybe the case if you play with the same group, but I play with a wide range of players and most sessions involve teaching a new comer a game. There would always be this inertia for my circle of gamers.

I found this a souless and ghastly experience that I never want to repeat. A rating of 4 reflects the quality of production, otherwise I would rate this a 2.

A very interesting and challenging board game.
I lost all the games I played in the beginning, and by far but still I enjoyed this game very much. Now I get to win more often and it feels good.
I like the challenge, the planning needed, the calculated risks, the fact that when you decide to do something, there is no luck involved and the infinite replayability because of all the different deck combinations, random maps and even adaptable enemy strength (in cities).

Only downside is: complex set of rules that need several games to remember everything and imply that you always have to be careful not to forget something.

Awesome game. Reminds me of Magic Realm but easier. Screams theme. At first I wasn't interested in this game because it looked like yet another deck building game. But the way it uses this mechanic is quite interesting. I like how you travel across a modular map and explore ruins, asault keeps and burn down monastaries. Especially burning down monastaries. Muhahahaha.

My only complaint are the rule books. Yes there are two. Other than that just make sure you commit to a good 3 hour solo game. If you put the time in you will be impressed.

It has various great characters, a new way to build your own deck, specific Character differences and interesting ways to work with a map + monster + resources gain and collecting.

Very impressive game. If you're heavily into this, this could be that one game of a lifetime.

I'm not a dungeon crawl kind of guy. At all. Infact, I haven't liked any of the other games of this style that I've tried. But this game is sufficiently euro that I can join in.

I really like the cardplay here. Also, the game really is very immersive.

But, I have only played it solo so far. The fact that I don't like solo gaming or computer gaming in general, but still enjoy this solo, probably says a lot about the quality of this game.

I will probably try to play it with someone else, but man, I'm afraid how long it will take. Even solo, the advertised 150 minutes playing time is crazy optimistic. That might be the playing time if you're very experienced, but two or three newbies, let alone 4, playing this is gonna take forever.

One thing that feels slightly frustrating is that once you're about to get going and have a few strong cards in your deck, the game is over. It is probably the correct decision from a designer perspective though.

So overall, this did not in any way look like my kind of game, but I still enjoy it very much. If it DOES look like your kind of game, then I think you are in for a real treat.

Played it solo a few times now and I LOVE IT. Can't believe that you can have such a rewarding gaming experience all by yourself. Takes time to learn and play, but you do get the reward!

Great theme, not really a deck builder in that you cycle maybe 2-3 times in a normal 2 day game. More like an army builder where your army is your deck.

My wife and I enjoy playing a campaign across a weekend, co-op of course. I would not like this game competitively. it's just too slow and thinky -- I'd have to leave and come back too many times.

It is a fascinating idea, and I really WANT to love this game. But it is too complicated. So many intricate rules that we had to constantly be scanning the rule book for every turn. I could see this becoming a lot more fun once we got the rules down, but that would take MANY plays and I have other games that I'd like to play instead of dedicating a month to this one. It is unfortunate, because it has so much potential.

RATING: 8.5
An incredibly deep strategy adventure game. The number of interactions available to the player is quite high. I believe the rules are less complex than many people suggest, but there are quite a bit of "fiddly" rules to remember. In such and such situation you do X but in every other situation you have to do Y. You can only do A/B/C if conditions D/E/F are met. There are dozens of rules that follow this pattern and you'll be referencing the two rule books for a while until you've encountered every odd combination of situations.

The only reason I'm not rating this a 10 or higher is because of BGG's rating suggestions. It is an EXCELLENT game, however I am not able to play it "all the time". Or necessarily willing. It takes a good chunk of time to set up, and then longer yet to play. I'm not opposed to long games, but long solo games (MK isn't ONLY solo but I think it's best solo) are harder to justify.

I would say the game is a 10 for quality, innovation, and thoroughness of world design and an 8.5 for "how often I want to play it".

Heroes of Might and Magic as a board game. A very good fantasy adventure game with an acceptable amount of randomness. I like the mechanisms of the game and the way it handles the theme. The theme itself is one of my least favorite themes (generic fantasy). Also this game is very fiddly. I guess I would very often not play it, just to prevent set-up and tear down of the game.

Not really difficult to learn, it's pretty straightforward and the training mission is terrific at gently introducing the rules.  Kind of a mix of deck building, resource management, and fantasy exploration.  Man this game is great.  I shied away from it because I thought it might be too complex and puzzley.  Wrong.  It's all about figuring out how to do the most with what you're given, finding the right sequence to play your cards/resources.  Love it.

I love this game! 

It's immensely satisfying to feel your character level up with a custom pool if skills that you've been building and when you eventually start taking out monsters that could easily murder you just a little bit earlier in the game. And yet at the same time everything you encounter is a new mini-puzzle as you try to figure out the best way to approach the ruins/keep/rampaging monster/etc to maximize your turn. And the biggest battles, whether it is a castle or the boss guy in the lost legion expansion really feel as tough and epic as you would expect! 

Every turn feels important and will engage you greatly throughout the whole experience

However, I don't think I would ever suggest playing this at 3+ players - especially if anyone's prone to AP. And the rules did take a while to learn the nuances of, but if you start this game expecting that it won't feel like a problem at all. Just sit down and set aside an evening for it and treat it like any other book.....

Also - I feel the lost legion expansion isn't absolutely essential, but it will make your solo and co-op players feel better. Feels like your gearing up for this huge threat that's marching your way rather than an empty feeling timer.

***Played 10+ times at 1-4 players as of this posting  No sight of getting tired of this game***

Beyond its pompous skirmishes-evoking title, Mage Knight is just another half-successful attempt by the same author at making a crossover between euros and ameritrash: nevertheless, despite his good will, rules and mechanics are still the core of a soulless game desperately trying to look thematic.

Ultimately playing Mage Knight feels more like an act of devotion to the playing mechanics in itself than a mind-relaxing pastime as it should be: the goal of this game indeed isn’t having fun as much as mastering the rules and making the best out of them, just like any other euros do.
The one difference between those and Mage Knight is you don’t have wooden cubes or discs here but four pre-painted, D&D Miniatures-quality figures instead of meeples, some fancy dice (all of them d6) to randomize the wooden cubes in play and a handful of plastic pieces acting the same as differently-colored wooden cubes would: like those though the game is card-driven, prevents randomness, punishes risky actions and requires every player to carefully choose how to best use the few actions he’s allowed to perform in a turn, each of them only once per in-game day or night. 

The actions on these cards are pretty limiting, so that you never feel like you can do what you really want to: it’s the same sensation of helplessness you experience in your typical eurogame, when for example you have to choose whether that turn you need to increase your red cubes production, feed your folk the yellow cubes or rather build a blue cubes factory, then brood over this decision during the other players’ turns and finally act according to the actions still available on the board. Thus, from an eurogamer’s point of view Mage Knight is undoubtedly thematic, fun and even innovative; yet from a thematic gamer’s point of view this game plays just too fiddly, complex and hopelessly boring.
You make a mistake, such as dashing into a difficult combat just to see what happens and losing it, and you waste any hope to make up with the other players for the rest of the game: shockingly indeed, there’s no such thing as luck here but, as in the Procustean bed of mythology, everything has to fit the rules and be comfortingly predictable or be dealt accordingly.
This sounds as bad design to me since it takes all the fun out of the game.

Given the huge feedback and the positive comments about Mage Knight I heard and read, I confess I expected much more out of this disappointing game. (Original comment written in January 2012, revised in September 2012)

[b]Edit[/b] - After further playing Mage Knight I’ve come to despise it, hence in September 2012 I lowered my previous rating from 6 to 4 and touched up my comment here and there accordingly to better couch my mind about the game.

Mage Knight is an experience.  It takes a lot of time to learn, and a lot of time to play.  

It took me a while before I was comfortable with the rules.  I actually took the rulebook with me to work/school and would study it on the bus and during down time.  I started several games that I didn't finish because I got too tired to continue.

Now that I have the rules down and a few wins under my belt, Mage Knight is my go-to solo game.

I don't consider the time investment that it takes to play this game as a negative thing.  If it didn't have as many rules, or if it didn't play for as long, it wouldn't be the epic fantasy adventure that it is.  

If you put in the time, it will be totally worth it.  The game is so intricate and exciting, it stays with you long after you finish playing.

way to complicated and way to long BUT when you started to get it... you are just one step to world of an epic Journey that gives you the feeling of FREEDOM. Whether you are going to be a good Warrior that many people love or you just burned down a monastery or plundered a village and the next thing you know is people just turn their back on you, they even don't want to talk to you, you feel that you are in the game. No, I would say you are one with your character. It's also personally the best solo RPG so far. What are you waiting for ? Go buy it now.

Update: Just so long and complicated and solitary and random.  It's not bad, but it gets old really fast.

Maybe the best of these fantasy RPG wannabe games I have played, but that still leaves something to be desired.  First off, this sucker is long.  You could get an actual and more fulfilling session of PnP roleplaying done in the same amount of time and the rules burden of Mage Knight is not significantly better either.  Furthermore like all of these games, after the first few plays you have seen all that the game has to offer and the gameplay is not compelling enough to warrant continues play.

As for gameplay specifics, the deckbuilding aspect is a pretty cool way to simulate the growth of your fantasy character.  Unfortunately, this also adds a fair amount of randomness as your turns are dictated by your hand more than any strategic considerations.  This is especially clear because movement is handled by your hand and movement costs are fairly high.  Multiple times a game you will suffer through useless turns due to lack of movement cards.  This is frustrating but the game needed another resource controlled by your hand beyond monster slaying potential.

I recommend everyone try it because it is solidly fun at first.

Got this almost sight unseen because of glowing reviews.  It's good, although my plays so far have been pretty limited.  I'm still struggling with the strategy here, so much seems to depend on the way the map unfolds.  Still, it's a great fantasy adventure game and gets bonus points for the fun factor while played solo.

I'll admit, I am not a fan of the original Mage Knight. And the learning experience I had can best be described as confusing.

And yet...and yet...there's a pretty cool adventure game that feels like a great port of some sort of MURP like Warcraft or Zelda or...whatever.

The card play is what gives the game its tension. So many chances for a great combo. So often, you're not _quite_ there. You know if you were a level higher...

The production values are excellent. There is a solid game with clear opportunities for expandability. The characters are a bit stock, but cool. Imagine something Fantasy Flight might do. Now streamline it so you can get four people around the table and play it in an afternoon.

The mechanics of this deck-builder/RPG/dungeon-crawler are beautiful to behold when you are able to put a good turn together, and though complex, there is a reason for every rule so play becomes intuitive after a few plays. Nothing is more satisfying than taking down a nasty enemy with some clever hand play. Expect 2 hrs per player, especially until everyone is very experienced. Truly an epic experience when all is said and done. Only knock is clunky PVP which makes it rarely used even when we play with it. I usually don't play with it since the game is great without it.

What can I say?
This game is amazing! I am a kind of a board game noob although I have played computer games and some board games back in the days. Me and my gf wanted to get into boardgaming because it's something we both can participate in. So we started looking at MK and Robinson Crusoe as OUR 1ST GAMES (co-op is what we wanted). At first I was kind of scared for her if she would be turned away by the heaviness of the games but she was actually happy when she heard it was "hard" (she only played Carcassone so far). So after a few looks into some reviews and the Rahdo (God bless you) runthrough we decided to get MK. 
And we were blown away by the amazing playability of MK as there're so many things one can do here and with so much style. We only played co-op but we'll try other modes as well. We both like EURO style games and we both like the good looks of board games (mostly from reviews-we only have a few board games) and MK has both.
The only problem this game has is its playing time...which is not a problem at all...it only makes it a more weekendish game ;D
People say there is too much downtime...not a problem at all...I mean we played it pretty smoothly (2 player game).
Analisys paralisys? Is this a negative thing? I mean is thinking bad? :o If you hate thinking so much then maybe think loudly and share it with your co player (in a co-op game ofc). Actually if you hate thinking this won't help you :/
All in all great mechanics, great replayability, great co-op, awesome graphics and minis, only time being your enemy.

RATING: 7.5
It's a fantasy board game that promises huge theme, but pretty much delivers none.

It's odd - there are some lovely things about this game. Every game round feels like a puzzle to solve, and by hook or by crook, you can generally get the job done, with a huge sense of satisfaction when you've achieved it. But what do you get for your troubles? a new spell? some dope actions? Well, maybe, but you'd better be in a position to use them there and then, because if you can't the chances are you're going to have to use them in their secondary capacity to move somewhere, and then you won't see them again until next round (where you have to rely on luck to be able to use them there).

You can literally go from being Jimmy Big-Guns to little Johnny crap-the-bed in a single turn, which wouldn't be so bad if the game were more abstract, and more emphasis were placed on the 'puzzle' aspect, but it has the well polished veneer of a fantasy epic and none of the flavour. 

Scratch the surface and you'll find a satisfying back story, lovely components, great ability and magic cards and loads of powerful monsters and allies and well crafted locations. However, dig a little deeper and there's no substance - The back story is never elaborated on, the ability and magic cards are as previously mentioned fleeting and often superfluous, the monsters are represented by cardboard tokens and are made of maths, and the cities - well crafted click-tracker minis - have no names, just colours.

It's sad really that so much work has gone into making this a fantasy themed game, with so little attention to detail.

That said, if you can overlook the shortcomings mentioned above, and focus on the fact that it's an excellent puzzle game, its well worth playing.

Shame I can't....

Working up to this. Baby steps.

I got it as solo thing but I'm wondering whether it might play well with friends once I get the rules down. That might take a while though.

One note. I still can't get over how shoddy the components are in this game. Badly cut cards, nasty card stock and no attempt to even land the paintbrush on the right place with the included minis. 

It's a pity because this game is a known classic.

Update: As I get into this game and pick up speed I'm getting really impressed. Now I have to play again before I forget how to. 8-)

This is an interesting title. It's not what I'd call thematic but it is immersive in its own way. It is a very, very thick problem solving title involving tossing around possible card combos and variations of chained moves together to accomplish a result, each telling a little story. It doesn't really add up to a whole story but a string of hard won moments of intellectual satisfaction, perhaps resulting in a feeling of accomplishment (and exhaustion) at the end. The rules are a bear to understand completely and just learning how to play and explore the game makes for a kind of game in itself. I'm glad to own it but see this as an event game for a solo play or two players at most.

Update: I dropped this to a seven just because it's such a bear to prepare for physically and mentally to play that I always find myself choosing something else.

Update: I really need to get this out again, watch Ricky Royal's videos and try to give this game another shot. Too many gamers whose taste I respect regard this too highly for me to allow it to sit on the shelf. Take the rating and comments with a grain of salt until then...

I like it. I don't like the way your draw dictates your play, but otherwise it's very solid. A good adventure game.

It takes very long and isn't as interactive as I want it to be.

While a bit difficult to get going, once you get a hold of the systems this game is fantastic. Every turn is incredibly engaging and offers a unique puzzle. Can be long with 3-4 players, but I've never had any problems because I was always so engrossed in trying to figure out what to do on my turn while other people were taking their turns. Highly recommend for any gamer wanting a heavy, deep strategic experience.

Pretty much my favorite game. The only flaw is the length of time it takes to play it and trying to convince friends to play with you. I actually feel like the game is easy to play if you are playing with someone who is familiar, however if you're the person who is trying to become familiar with it for your friends to play with you, it's very hard to learn and remember all the little details of rules (cheat sheets help). Overall I love this game, I hope it keeps getting expansions. I would buy anything related to this game.

Bought solely on the weight of the buzz here on the Geek. I was into the original Wiz Kids miniatures game (which I liked despite being a collectible) but stayed away from this on the reports that it had little in common with the original game. Based on what I've read, I expect to like this as it seems to echo a lot of what I liked about Magic Realm (now if that ever gets properly redone!). Peeling back the onion now - stay tuned! A big plus is the designed-in solitaire mode. Rating tentative just based on research - I expect it to go up...
++++++
More reading, more peeling, sorting and bagging (to sleeve or not to sleeve?) and I'm liking everything I'm seeing so far. A little concerned about the downtime and whether I can interest my group to get into this. Back in the days of epic sessions with Titan and Magic Realm, the length of this game would have been no problem; but times have changed (para-phrasing Larson: "my fellow dinosaurs: we have a problem - the climate is changing, the mammals are taking over and we have brains the size of walnuts!). Despite being a dinosaur and possibly the only one of our group that will go for this I'm upping my rating - even though I haven't had a chance to actually play yet.
++++++
First Play: three-player introductory exploration scenario. Yes, it was long but there are a lot of moving parts here and it took a while to get going. But get going we did - and we required fewer and fewer searches through the rules materials to keep us going. We were not disappointed. This game should provide a rich gaming experience for anyone hungering for a hack and slash extravaganza! So far, the only game that has come close to scratching my Magic Realm itch (and I've tried a few).
++++++
Couple plays now and it just gets better! The introductory scenario (which is a fine game btw) with three players takes only two to three hours and we were all ready for more! Time to move on up and check out some other scenarios. I would also like to try this with four players to see how much downtime is added which, at this point, is my only concern with this game.
++++++
Couple more plays and the more I play the better I like it and I've run out of room to improve my rating of it. While I still think the combat routines in Magic Realm were the best ever devised for "hack and slash," I like every aspect of this game. One thing I've decided is that three player really is the sweet spot. I've yet to try four and I'm in no hurry to do so - I think that might tip the downtime scale too much. Of course one expects an expansion and I'm looking forward to that too. An amazing achievement for Vlaada Chvatil!

Want to love this game, but learning curve is a nightmare. After several plays, I find this game is just too much work for very little reward. I find myself frustrated by this game.

Don't know why I missed this gem of a game for so long.

Almost a 10 for me, only downsides are learning curve and downtime - don't play this with AP players, or you'll be in for torture while they dither about what to do and how to do it in their turn (and then take it back and plan it again, argh).

Not sure it works with 4, might depend on the map/scenario. Surprisingly engaging solo.

Wish there was a bit more deck building, you don't usually add (or remove) many cards during the game.

--- Update, adding in the expansions this is a fantastic solo game. The learning curve is pretty steep (I'm still climbing). Rating up to 10 :)

For me, this feels more like a strategy puzzle rather than a game. More often than not I'm trying to figure out how to do what I want to do with the options I have, when it doesn't work out...it feels like a pain in the butt.

However, when you get the rules down and everything starts to click it starts to feel like a really fun game and it easily becomes the best SOLO game I have yet to play. If you can get over the STEEP learning curve it's well worth a buy.

That being said, set up and tear down is annoying as all get out and you need a lot of table space. The game can go on for hours and at the end I'm exhausted and tearing everything down and putting it all back in the box is the biggest con.

RATING: 9
Thoroughly impressed after one play.  If you don't like fantasy adventure games, I don't think this will persuade you, but it may be my favorite of the genre.  I think it's because it tells a story, but feels strategic.  I'm going to go after forts, or magic towers, or maybe I boost up my influence and build up cards traveling to friendly towns.  Maybe I spend my time gathering mana crystals, and discovering altars in ancient ruins to gain fame points.  I remember opening the box, thinking there weren't a whole lot of artifacts/spells/advanced actions, figuring it would get stale quick.  But I was surprised, you gain cards very methodically, and it makes the decision of what you acquire important, because these special cards really feel special, each one attuned to a particular character build.

As someone who digs fantasy settings and strategy games, this one pulls all the right strings.  Looking forward to further plays, just to see if my opinion changes.

A very good game, but could use better scenarios and the rules are too complex.

One part euro, one part adventure game, and one part puzzle. It's on the verge of being amazing, but it's as if the designer self-imposed a rule when designing it that the game can't include even the slightest amount of any ameritrash aspects in it, and because of that, it falls well short of what it could have been.

edit: thinking about it more, it's not really a game. It's a puzzle with a couple cool mechanics.

RATING: 4
Runebound-type game (basically a free roaming adventure) but much more detailed and in depth.   Very clever design- the way the actions and mana work is very cool as is the deckbuilding element to improve your hero and take wounds.  And I was definitely roped in by this for a while.  But after some plays I'm finding it really gamey- after a while you know what monsters you can face so you can pretty much prepare and be sure you're going to be able to have success when you go into a ruin or whatever.  Needs some dice (besides the mana dice) to add a little more uncertainty.  So the theme kind of vanishes after a while.  I wish there were sequences of adventures or more a story that was told.  So in the end it's too much of a hybrid.  If I'm looking for theme I'll play something else.  If I'm looking for a heavy euro I'll play something else.

I wanted to like it, I really did. But it kept on making my husband and I cranky every time we sat down to play it. I remember saying about it "I just wouldn't call it fun" and I have to be honest - that is a pretty important requirement when I decide what game to set up to play.

This has far exceeded my expectations.  It beautifully integrates an adventure game with Euro mechanics.  The board provides a lot of information (not perfect information but a lot).  Therefore, the card draw is the only randomness, like in any deck building game (not that this is one), the issue is how to make maximum progress given the hand of cards you've been dealt.  I think MK:TBG performs masterfully.

Juego de aventuras en las que cada jugador se hacer cargo de un personaje con características propias. En su turno, el jugador tiene que utilizar las cartas de su mano, que son las que le van a permitir realizar acciones. Esas cartas se roban de un mazo propio, al que se pueden ir añadiendo nuevas cartas a medida que vas consiguiendo ciertos logros o adquisiciones. Se juega en escenarios y el tablero es modular, y se va descubriendo poco a poco (al menos en el escenario inicial, que hasta el momento es el único que he jugado). El objetivo imagino que depende del escenario, aunque lo habitual será lograr mayor número de puntos de victoria. Una ronda dura hasta que uno de los jugadores agota su mazo. Las cartas tienen dos usos : básico y avanzado.. para usar el avanzado se necesitará maná de determinado tipo, que se tiene que usar en el turno o se pierde (a menos que el personaje lo cristalice). Hay cartas de hechizos, se pueden contratar unidades, que te ayudarán en combates etc. A medida que el personaje se desplaza por el tablero, se puede ir interactuando de diversas formas (contratar unidades, saqueos, entradas a mazmorras, combates, etc).

Es un juego muy completo y con muchas opciones. A pesar de que la mano está compuesta (En principio) por cinco cartas, hay que pensar muy bien qué hacer y cómo hacerlo.

Los componentes son fabuloso. No es un juego para no iniciados. Puede resultar algo "atorante" o lento, por la cantidad de cosas que hay que pensar.

Aguardo siguiente partida para matizar valoraciones.

(reposted from http://thegamebox.byethost15.com/smf/index.php?topic=1420.1260)

Not quite sure how I feel. It's got the level of 'annoyance burden' that Magic Realm and Arkham Horror do,
in terms of crappy rules, painful lookups for all sorts of special cases, and the like. On the other hand, I like
the storyline/playout better than either of those others (I think), and it still captures some of that very personal
association with the character - though maybe not quite as much.

One big gripe is, and this is definitely like MR, that it feels over too soon, even when the game takes too
long to play. I had hoped this would just be the learning scenario that felt that way, but even the conquest scenario
feels as though I'm just hitting stride. I guess one can (like MR) extend these further, but maybe just the finite ending
is the issue. Dunno.

Part of the problem there is the 'someone wins anyhow' rule. For the conquest scenario, after it became clear that 
there was no way in hell we would get the victory conditions (it was a pretty dicky game - something she's getting much
better at), it ended up with me gobbling up the citadels she already had, in an attempt to 'catch up'.

Update (after several more plays): yeah, this is getting addictive. I definitely like it better than Thunderstone, even if it takes more thought. There just aren't the gamey factors which get in the way of that one. I also think it does a better job of giving an 'engaging' goal in the various scenarios than does Magic Realm. Oh, I'm sure that MR could be modded to provide closer to a play experience that I enjoy, but this one does a better job, on all wheels, out of the box. A lot less agonizing over what the hell some ability actually means too - even if figuring out the combats is just as taxing. Still, I find it's a lot easier to get up to speed on what happens when with this game. My final comparison is to Arkham Horror. This is so much better, with the semi-coop feel, for me. Yeah, I'd probably like AH better with that aspect - but it doesn't fit the 'flavor' of AH to do so. Here, if anything, I can put myself in the mindset of a general, who will be rebuked if the mission fails, but really wants to come out on top of his class, even if it means a wee bit of friendly fire.

RATING: 7.5
Feels like a hugely-improved Runebound, with actual strategy and much-reduced randomness. We played 4-player, and like comments on BGG here suggest, this is a suboptimal # and I wouldn't play 4-player again. I think 3 would be good, maybe co-op. We ended up only playing the 'short' version at 2 days instead of 3, and it still took us just over 5 hours.

The mechanic of making your hand and being able to hold cards over to your next turn is huge: it allows you to plan say a 'fighting' hand this round and keep 'purchasing' cards for next round. That said, there is still some (unwelcome) luck both in the cards you get, and in the tiles drawn. Like Runebound, towards the end as heroes are powered up, it more devolves into a race to who can get to the easier monsters fastest.

Still, very enjoyable and I would play 2 or 3 players again. If you could get a full game done in 3 hours or less I feel it would be a most satisfying fantasy boardgaming experience.

Update: played second game, bumped to a 7.5

Extraordinary game. Beautiful art, solid components. The theme is captured very well. The game is highly complex and there are tons of decisions to make. It´s hard for me to analyze the strong points here. But to conquer a city after juggling with your cards for 20 minutes is a great feeling. Still, I cannot imagine to play this with more then two players...the downtime must be ridiculous. The learning curve is very high and the game is pretty long, even in solo play. Speaking of, Mage Knight is great solo, especially with the Lost Legion expansion.

Played hundreds of hours of this game since getting it Dec 2016. Favourite game to play with two players and the first game I think of when I want exploration and adventure. One of the few games where I enjoy being immersed in that I don't really care about winning or adding up the points at the end of the game. 

This game would be perfect if it was less combat driven, or at least had more perils than combat enemies. The expansions provided a little taste of this with catapults and the ability to block using movement.

This is also the game that taught me to play the hand you've got, and not to work against what you've been given. I can see this being a problem for players who want to achieve specific tasks.

This is a good game.  The components are fantastic.  I find the exploration of the world and fighting of monsters fun.  I enjoy the reputation track. However, I cannot stand the deckbuilding aspect of the game.  Every game felt the same.  Each character felt the same.  Yes you get a few different cards and skills over the course of the game, but all the characters basically felt the same.  Plus, I despise the movement in the game.  What?  I didn't draw any movement cards?  I can't move unless I discard most of my cards which I will need in order to find or recruit? Incredibly frustrating.  Not for me.

My current rating might be too high, but it really shows how much I like the game right now. Each play has been an engrossing experience, and time really flies when we play. I still have to check the rulebook from time to time, but so far it has been a blast.

Downgraded to an 8, since I have not played it in a few months and have not been missing it.

Right in this moment I have finished my first solo-game. It is strange because I'm not an AP-prone person, but the second I started my solo play I went fully AP.

Perhaps the only multiplayer game I can safely say is best with one.  Yes, you can play it with two, and it is fun that way - but with any more, the downtime is really not worth it.  There is very little player interaction in this game.  Yes, or course, you can engage in PvP combat, but it wastes precious turns to do so, and the game doesn't incentivize it very well (the risks far outweigh the rewards imo).  So, with more than two players, you will be waiting a long time between turns, and those other players don't really add much to the game; in fact, the game somewhat suffers from runaway leader issues.  If you want to play with more than two, play the co-op mode.

As a solo game, this is very immersive.  It is basically a huge efficiency/optimization puzzle game.  It is very mathy, and benefits from working your hand in multiple ways turn by turn.  One of the beauties of this game is that there are so many ways to skin any particular cat-conundrum.  You'll often work through many possible combinations of moves and say "Aha!  Yes, this just lets me do exactly what I want!"  At the same time, just as often you'll be left saying "If only I had one more card..."  The real innovation to this game is that all cards in the deck can be played as weak additives to one of the four basic actions (move, fight, block, influence) - so you're never left with a totally bum hand, just a sub-optimal one.  

Ok, as far as theme goes, the game is a little wonky.  It is a heavy game, rulesy, and simulates an awful lot of things we'd want in an adventure/fantasy game.  Exploring is cool; fighting is cool.  Going into a dungeon and seeing what's there is tense.  There's magic, and day and night cycles.  There are followers.  You can pillage and burn things.  Really, this is as close to Magic Realm as any modern board game will get.  And yet, the theme doesn't quite stick.  Perhaps it's the deterministic, mathy nature of the game (no dice, fool!), perhaps it is the lack of flavor text, but it feels more like a Euro.  This is not bad for someone like me, but a Runebound fan might object (although the Ameritrash fans I've played it with have claimed it superior, and more fun, than Runebound).  One of the really cool things about the game is how much it does with so few components - it feels epic, and yet can easily fit on anyone's table.  Lovers and haters alike will agree, I think, that this is a very unique game.  If you are looking for a heavy brain-burn that uses Euro mechanisms, and is best with a low player count, this will not disappoint.

This just gets better and better. Cool theme, awesome components, and an innovative premise: a dungeon-crawler with no dice! I love the deck-building aspect, love the cool spells, advanced actions, military units, and special abilities. The different scenarios and the expansion, not to mention the solo options, give you so many ways to play that you should never tire of this game.

The lack of an index for the rulebooks is unfortunate, and the game runs a little long, but usually I am so engrossed that I don't even notice the hours fly by. I do hate having to discard handfuls of cards just so I can move two or three spaces on the board. This single feature of the gameplay almost kills the game for me: it makes some turns drag interminably, and is generally annoying. We usually alleviate this by giving each player a +1 movement skill token at the beginning of the game. Is this cheating? Yes, but who cares.

Tougher than it looks. The rules could be better...a lot of cross referencing between books.  Some rules are unclear. More of a card puzzle than a rousing adventure. Still, this really works as a solo game.

This is good stuff.  It's a bit of a bear to teach a bunch of people the base game just so you can get to the real game.. but I think it might be worth it.  Also, it's longer than stated on the box, allow about an hour per person.

RATING: 9
The introductory game took us 4 hours, excluding setup. I think it is a very elegant take on the genre. 

Main criticisms of the other players were too few choices for the length, too much dependence on having the right cards at the right time, too complex final scoring and the disadvantage going last in the first round. 

While I do believe all these points are valid to some degree, for me the rules never get in the way of the fun. The mixture of deck building and classic character improvement, plus exploration and tactical combat add up to a real keeper.

It's too long, the combat is clunky, and some of the cards are poorly balanced.  I still enjoy playing it solo occasionally, but doubt I will keep this in my collection for long.  Much rather play Fallen or even Runebound.

2/12/2016 - This game is long and fairly complex. This means not only does it fail to hit the table frequently, but when it does I have to re-read all of the rules from scratch since it's been so long since the last time I played. It's a really good game. I just wish it was shorter!

Mage Knight: I love you.

A wonderful mix of theme and complex, euroy mechanics.  It's got exploration and combat, hand management and deckbuilding, frequent interesting decisions and loads of variety, not to mention the occasional stand-up moment.

Let's not lie: this is a complex game.  It's going to take a while to learn.  You're going to get tired of running your friends through the tutorial scenario.  It takes a long time to play, and probably has too much downtime with 3-4 players.

That said, solo or 2-player it is a remarkable game.  Definitely worth checking out if you like big games, complex-but-thematic mechanics and fantasy adventures.

Ugh.. I've tried this one out twice using the introductory scenario (3-players each game, two different people teaching the game).  The game dragged on and on, with a lot of downtime between turns as each player went through all of the possible permutations of their cards and the available mana dice.  Seems like this game is best suited as a solitaire game for someone who likes the puzzle aspect of games and enjoys analysis paralysis.

I went into both games wanting to like it, but after each play, I just wanted to get back my time investment.  I will strongly resist playing this if someone suggests it, so I rate it a 3/10.  Never again...

MK is a very challenging Euro/adventure game somewhat based on the old WizKids miniatures game. It has some really interesting deckbuilding and cardplay but also some special powers and such that make the game different every time. 
However, the most commonly used phrase in our house when playing this game is "Well crap. This isn't going to work at all." It can be very frustrating if you don't get the cards that you need.

This is mostly a solo "after my daughter is in bed" type of game for me.  I don't see this being played much multi-player due to game length, but I think this is one of the most challenging and engaging solo experiences out there.

I could probably enjoy this sort of non-interactive experience with an RPG video game more than a boardgame.  but to be fair i could replay this game under different conditions and enjoy it more, because there are some cool elements, but for a first time game with four players, it just wasn't my cup of tea.  The whole night and day thing was unique and changed game play but seemed unnecessary and made hero development seem like it was happening over the span of a few days...

Amazingly deep game, although quite complicated. Combat is pleasantly challenging, especially when you factor in monster powers and resistances. Seriously beautiful components, I love the pre-painted miniatures. Each game will be wildly different thanks to randomized environment tiles and card offers, as well as many different scenarios with varied difficulties and objectives. The deck-building is extremely light, but I still think it's interesting that Mage Knight uses deck building as a mechanic in a larger game. This is a game that's very customizable if you like making your own rulesets or scenarios. The learning curve is pretty steep but the game includes a beginner scenario that does a good job of explaining the different phases and structures without being too overwhelming.

Based on 1 play with 4 players on the starting scenario:

Let me be clear up front: Hours-long, complex games with steep learning curves are generally not my cup of tea. I love the themeatic aspect to adventure-y/dungeon crawl-y games, but very rarely do I love the mechanics.

And so it is with Mage Knight. There is a surprising amount I like about the game, so perhaps my rating will rise with future plays (which for once I am not opposed to), but my first play even guided by two experienced players resulted in a lot of confusion, questions, and rules-referencing.

First: I like the deckbuilding component and the way it ties into your character progression. I like games where cards have multiple uses, and it works brilliantly here. I don't know why more deckbuilders don't do this.

Generally, I enjoyed trying to manage my hand such that I could work my way toward bigger and better monsters.

And yet... it feels like maybe this is too long a game to rely on such a luck-driven system? It felt like it was pretty easy to get screwed several turns in a row with bad draw after bad draw. I found my interest waning as the game went on.

This is probably scenario-specific, so I'd be interested to try more scenarios (especially the co-op ones), but the endgame felt just anticlimactic. There isn't really an interesting goal, especially since everything is so procedurally generated that long stretches of the game simply feel aimless. I'm fine with games where you spend the early game trying to beef up your character, and then do something cool, but here it didn't feel like we were moving toward anything interesting.

Player interaction is also surprisingly light. Again, this might be improved in the co-op scenarios. But I prefer something like Descent, where strategizing together is core to the game. Here, I felt I could largely ignore other player's turns. Perhaps this would be better improved if we'd tried any PvP, but generally just beating other people up to try and hinder their progress, at the expense of making progress for yourself, really doesn't sound compelling.

I would love to see a simplified version of this game. There's so many moving pieces that connect, and so many of them feel superfluous or overly complex (the way you calculate damage is a mess) that it is just not the kind of experience that appeals to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyed playing the few times I played with friends. But just takes too long with not everyone willing to read the rules or watch a video just to learn the game. That or the investment of time you would need to play to make everyone's turn go faster without having to put a limit on time for turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played twice, 3-player intro game both times; one lasted over 4 hours & the 2nd clocked in at slightly less than 2 hours.  The time did go quickly, but ye gods!  There is a steep learning curve and the rules are not easily referenced (we were constantly retrieving the many cards scattered across the table which laid out the actions available for the different locations).  Gameplay, as another reviewer commented, felt like 3 solitaire games going on at once --- just a man and his deck, silently making calculations to see if he can successfully attack some nasty critter.  Perhaps player vs. player would change this, but I suspect this also adds considerably to an already long playing time.

I am not a RPG fan, and I tend to stay away from fantasy games.  I suspect any rating I gave would be unfairly influenced by this.  I suspect this plays much better as a solitaire game or as a 2-player.  I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I shudder to think of the time required to play a longer version with 4 players.

Having said all this, it is a big step up from the all the dice-rolling orgies I remember from years gone by.  I can understand why a lot of people are pretty excited about this.

This is best as a solo or two player experience but be prepared for a 3-4 hour game.

Woah, this game is very complex and very long. As in very, very long (not compared to many wargames or “epic” games like Twiligt Imperium or Civilization, but compared to almost every other new game). At least that’s the case with “the long game”-version and 3 players. I think it’s much better with two as the third player doesn’t add too much to the game, and I would never try it with 4! The short game (2 days and 2 nights) works well and I’d probably prefer to play it that way going forward.

MK features some intriguing mechanics and LOTS of small rules which you are almost guaranteed to forget during your first couple of plays. But it’s quite satisfying nonetheless; it’s one of those “semi-epic” games because it’s so long. The overall exploration/moving/fighting/deckbuilding mechanics work well as far as I’m concerned. Sure, you might not draw a lot of “move” cards and be limited that way, or you don’t have enough attack cards to attack the creature you want etc. (which by the way is very neat as you can see its strength and abilities, so you can plan ahead, which you need to do in order to keep up the speed), but you can always use other cards for the attributes you need.

The deck-building element is cool, although it’s certainly not a hardcore deck building mechanism; you usually cannot really trash a lot of cards or recycle your deck quickly. Other cool features are the night and day; it doesn’t change the game fundamentally, but it still brings a nice flavor to the game. The sort of “level up” mechanic is also neat – I like that you gradually become stronger as you get room for more mercs and acquire extra cards with special abilities for your deck. The way you hire different mercenaries in different places (cities, keeps, towers etc.) is a good idea, although I once again have to mention those rules… There are a lot, and they mostly aren’t too troublesome, but there are so many of them, and I’m sure that you could have removed some of them in order to streamline it. Yes, the game wouldn’t be exactly the same, but I think it would be better and still feel “epic”.

The spells seem very strong, and I actually feel that they vary quite a bit in strength (not that they’re broken, not at all, but some are simply much better than others. I really like the spell which outright destroys a monster)… The many rules and how hard you need to plan your move in order to move and attack units etc. definitely make your head hurt, and it really sucks when you need to backtrack because you forgot something and cannot do what you wanted… This will happen a lot!

I understand those who claim that MK works as a solo game; I think I might try that one day, and I’m normally not a solo gamer at all. But I will never try it with 4, and even with 3 I think it’s rather boring (as is the coop variant), and because it takes so many hours to play I cannot justify to give it a higher rating; I won’t play it too much because of the fiddly rules and long play time.

I would probably rate this higher, except for the fact that it can be a very, very long game.  I really like the ideas, concepts, mechanics, artwork, and everything else about this game, other than the time that one must dedicate to playing it.  That keeps it from being an "I always want to play" type of game to a "yeah, it's a great game and I will occasionally want to play it, if I am in the right mood" kind of game.

Not that it is overly long for the enjoyment, but it does stretch the limit of "how much effort do I really want to put into such a long game?"  Other games that are just as long are better, in my opinion.

The game really shines after you get out of the intro scenario.  Be careful, though: mistakes in the early game or can be extremely punishing.

A great role-playing game with well-painted miniatures and interesting hands management. The best part of this game is whenever the player levels up and takes the new cards/skills/rewards, you can actually feel your character is growing stronger, learning new stuff and become stronger to conquer whatever enemies lied ahead. 

Despite the RPG elements the game is also highly strategical. In long term strategy, the players need to plan which card/skills should they take in order to build a strong character(deck), while in short term they would need to optimize their actions depends on their hands. 

Having a strong character can easily interfere other players' plans by attacking them, hiring strong mercenaries before them or rapidly clear the monsters on the board to prevent other players getting the rewards, which make the game strongly interactive. All the scenarios are really fun to experience and if your friends don't like the scenarios, you can always use the house rules or settings to maximize the utility. 

The only setback of the game is the playing time, since there are so many possibilities and things to do in this game, every player needs tremendous downtime to plan and act which results in an average 3-4 hrs or longer playing time.

A great, well designed game. It does sometimes almost feel more like a tabletop roleplaying experience than a board game, and you may be hard pressed to get casual gamers to play it with you, especially since play times sometimes run pretty long.
I have found that under most scenarios, there is somewhat underwhelming player interaction, even with the PvP battling component. This and the general depth of the game, in my opinion, usually make it better suited for playing alone with the solo campaign variant.

Overly long with not enough player interaction. The use of a deck gives a little bit of stuff to think about but it is pretty random and the decisions are obvious. The trouble is that the deck kills all tension in fighting the monsters. It is all pure number crunching analysis. The analysis takes time, which leads to huge downtime. I'd like to try this again with 2 players before rating. I'm guessing it will be a 5 or a 6 from me.

After playing 2 multi-players and 5 solo games, I love the adventure of this game.  This game contains a lot of luck but it still contains a lot of strategy to level up, to take wounds and to best use of the hand deck.  Is is a very clever deck building mechanism combining into the strategic adventure game. Solo challenge is awesome!  It is also a good game for 2 fast thinking players.

RATING: 8
Mage Knight hasn't aged well.  As the queue for our table has lengthened, our tolerance for Mage Knight has diminished.  I believe that this is caused by Mage Knight's card play and overwrought rules.  

Take movement for example.  Almost every boardgame requires us to make decisions about how to move best.  In MK we always seem to struggle to move at all.  I'm a big fan of games that reward meaningful decisions.  But struggling against a crappy hand of cards in order to move from point A to point B is neither meaningful nor rewarding.  

Worse for MK, we've discover other titles that present the fantasy genre, require deck management, and have meaningful decisions.  Games that don't require you to look up cryptic symbols time and time again either.  

I still like MK, but it's overwrought.  It's long for what it is, and it's fragile.  A bad hand of cards makes you feel like sweeping it all back in the box.

I'd probably give MK a 9 as a solo game ... but only a 6 or 7 as a two player co-op.  I don't think I'd play it with 3 or more gamers at the table.


-------------------------------------------------

After taking the game off the shelf yet again, and finding it as enjoyable as ever, I've bumped its rating to a 10.  True expansions aren't worth much, the rules are terrible, and I definitely prefer solo play to multiplayer competitive.  Yet as a solo game, Mage Knight is a true 10.

-------------------------------------------------

I'm enjoying exploring this game solo with the occasional co-op game.

The rules are a definite weakness.  We've all played wargames and other games with complex, exception filled rules.  MK's rules seem to have been approached with a bizarre mentality which I'm going to refer to as "brevity diffused".  They seem very resistant to repeating themselves, yet at the same time they are spread out across two full books and numerous reference cards.  The result is chaos.  

I have to believe that as popular as the game has proven, it would have been even bigger hit if the rules had been better structured.  Structured, not written.  I think the rules are decently written, but they are -horrifically- structured.  I was lucky that in coming late to the party, I had a wealth of demo videos to watch and experienced players to learn from.

It's a longer and more involved game, but is very engaging. It takes quite a few plays to unpack the layers of complexity, and the experience is very different based on the number of people and the mode of play. Haven't decided which mode is my favorite yet.

The grown up, thinking man's fantasy game. Oodles of tough decisions to make every turn, with pretty deep combat (no simple modifiers + dice roll here, no sir). Console/PC RPG gamers will feel right at home with how the status ailiments and physical/magic resistances work. 

Your deck/hand of cards dictates what you can do to a certain extent, but each one can effectively be used in three different ways (normal, powered up, or played sideways for a completely different, weaker effect). You can also keep unused cards from one turn to the next, to build the perfect hand for killing a tough enemy or sprinting across the countryside (though you can be punished if you go through your deck much slower than the other players).

Wow.
Bought this in October 2016 and didn't stop playing (no break longer than a week or so) until I received Gloomhaven in March 2017.
UPDATE: Picked it right back up in November 2017 and am about to finish my second game already. It's still hard to figure out if I like this or Gloomhaven more. I prefer the overall MK game experience to individual scenarios of Gloomhaven, but it's close, and the GH overall campaign experience adds just a bit more fun to the overall experience.

The more I play this the more I like it. It makes me want to do things with my characters that I would normally not do in fantasy role playing games; and, I enjoy this games thematic qualities enough to say, for me, this game offers the right balance of complexity and control mechanic to be enjoyed as an RPG.

 I took a risk when i got this game. I hadn’t played it prior to buying it. I bought it on great reviews it was getting online. I had to see if this game was as good as everyone made it out to be. So i took the plunge and dived in feet first.
 How hard can a game be to learn? i asked myself.
well, it took me two readings of the rule books before i was confident enough to show it to other people. At first seemed like a huge clusterfuck of rules, and none of it made any sense. at which point i was kinda toying with the idea of putting on the shelf and calling it a day. But i trooperd on through the misty obscurity. then when i played it again about 2 turns in i had a moment of clarity. it all just fit into place like some weird ethereal jigsaw. it all made sense. from then on I’ve enjoyed every minute of this game. Don't get me wrong the game isn't without its problems. this isn't the kind of game you’d wanna play with your 11 year old nephew. this is a gamers game and it demands your full attention. the game is astonishing. Every time i play i come away feeling I’ve learned something new about the game.  the intricacies in the mechanics are just mind boggling.
I’d have given it a 10 if it wasn't for the rule books. Great game though.

RATING: 8.5
The game that got me into modern board games. Ultimately, it's a card game, a realllly long card game (yes with a modular board). So great, but the minis are horrible.

update: Tonight I replayed MK after only playing it a couple times in the last year. I had come to think I didn't really like MK any more. Too long, bloated, fiddly. On a whim I played sans Volkare and just ran through the solo conquest from the base game and wow...the game opened back up for me. I want to play it again. It's the perfect puzzly adventure euro solitaire romp. It felt like coming home again. About half way through I thought, 'oh ya, Mage Knight is amazing'. A real lesson for me. An expansion can ruin a game.  
Without all the fiddly Volkare/Lost Legion mess spattered on it, Mage Knight might well be one of my favourite games. I can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 7.5
Very impressive.  Definitely scratches my Magic Realm itch.  Rating will hopefully go up as we explore it. 

Update: 

Well it's been about five games and I thought I should revisit my feelings on the game. It remains an impressive update of the Magic Realm genre.  Granted, Magic Realm is in a genre of it's own, but Mage Knight is the first thing that comes remotely close to approximating it.  I find myself deeply conflicted about Vlaad's designs.  I think they are smart, but too procedural to be fully compatible to my taste.  The little subsystems begin to feel rote after a game or two and their clever veneer wears thin.  I say this as someone who has affectionately played many games of Galaxy Trucker, Space Alert, Dungeon Lords, and Mage Knight.  But I think MK is also something more.  The game manages to capitalize on the excellent aspects of Vlaad's design tendencies without bogging itself down.  This is partly successful because the game space is so damn open.  There's still plenty of bog out there but you simply don't need it.  

In other words, this game gets a little bump.  I'll let it sit at 8.5 for now and see where it is in 5 plays.

Update:
Well 5 plays later my feelings are starting to cool.  Once players know what they are doing much of the games charm starts to wear off.  It's still a good game but it's hardly a replacement for Magic Realm.  Vlaada's procedural puzzles just don't interest me.  Down to a 7.5.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Epic game. Two playthroughs so far (in two player), the second of which I managed to win by employing some masterful sorcery techniques.

EDIT: I've since played with 3 players and had to alter my opinion drastically. When an additional player is added this game suffers very seriously from down time due to the nature of the deck-building mechanic (like a mini arithmetic puzzle for each player). Whilst I'm more than happy to sit and watch someone map out their turn in a two player game, it just becomes an absolute slog with three players. The problem is compounded if someone ahead of you carries out an action (or actions) that you intended to carry out yourself, because you'll often find yourself with a hand of cards that will only allow you to move a couple of spaces and...erm...that's it. So sometimes you'll wait 15 or 20 minutes (no exaggeration) for your turn to come along only to quickly spend all of your cards on movement, then it's back to waiting again. Rinse, repeat.

If I'm going to dedicate an entire night (easily 6 - 7 hours) to playing a game I'd want much more player interaction and a great deal less down time.

Having said all that, I can comfortably say this is one of the best games I've played in a long time. I just don't know if I'll ever play it with more than two people again.

RATING: 10
When I first played this game, I rated it an 8.5.  I really liked it, but I wasn't quite sure I understood it enough and didn't want put it too high.

I played it a few times solo to get a better understanding of the rules and, wow, the game really opened up to me.  This game is a complex puzzle of hand management and presents a number of agonizing decisions.  I will say that it is very math-y game, but that's exactly what I was looking for.

Some same the theme isn't rich and some of the rules are not intuitive, but I find that, once you get a hang of the game, the rules make a lot of sense and the theme really does come through.  Do I burn a monastery to the ground for a quick boost or will the loss of reputation hurt me too much later for recruiting elite units?

I love playing this game with my friends, but what really makes it a "10" in my ranks is that it is the first game that I actually enjoy playing solo.  Vlaada's finest work, and that's saying something.

RATING: 9
This is one of the best game i own.

I love the card building aspect with how you move and fight. The conjuring of a plan and it WORKS! so satisfying. 
It is more like a sandbox rpg game with that you can get fame points on several ways and choosing being evil or good.. in the end the karma does not matter because you are a bad ass mage knight how just dont give a damn.

It got all i want from a game, exploration, fighting epic beasts, growing stronger and then game ends. 

I have only 3 negative things to say about this game is that 1, the last round does not feel like a last round. It feels like anti-klimax. You have built up your character by hiring soldiers to your growing army, learning new skills and spells, invading keeps and burning monasteries and then it's the last round and you just keep thinking "well, if i kill that monster i get a bit more fame and maybe i will win"
I've played mostly Conquest mode where only one can be the winner. 
The Lost legion fixed this issue for me with the boss model but the game is then co-op. 
2, The rulebook.. oh my.. the rulebook is a wall of text and so boring to read. There is a alot of good "how to play" videos on youtube however. 
3, The time it takes... it's an epic game with an epic length 

Still, best game i own. 
Works best with 3 people.

Amazing adventure game with originality in the rules for movement and combat.
Gives a good feeling for adventuring in a high fantasy world where you are on your own campaign and can choose to cooperate or compete with your fellow players.
The best part for me is that it is possible to cooperate for one turn and then on the next move turn against your earlier  ally and then go back again even if it is unlikely that your fellow player will trust you again but he might not have a choice depending on the threats he is facing.

Wow, this is one of the best RPG experiences I've had with a board game. The open-ended world and its almost endless possibilities feels like something out of Heroes of Might & Magic and I just love the way movement and combat works. A game that is not only extremely well designed with an amazing look, but also rich on cool game mechanics which offers the players plenty of fun not only as a group but even as a solitaire game.

This is certainly a very heavy game which feels like a mix between a board game and a role playing game. It blends together a myriad of mechanics and allows for several different choices. My only problem with the game is that it takes a very long time, bot to set up and to play, although you can play shorter campaigns if you don't want to play long games all the time.

Epic carddriven fantasy game! You need to enjoy reading rules to appreciate it, you actually get two rulebooks with this game, one rulebook proper and one walkthrough. I think the rules are well written and the walkthrough is a great idea and almost a must for learning the game. Components are generally great but i don´t like the hero miniatures, not much detail and the faces look very weird on two of them (Arythea looks like a intergalactic xeno and Norowas seem to have some kind of nose birth defect). They are pre-painted and that's nice but to be honest I could have painted all of them myself in less than an hour. The cities however are great looking once properly painted. I think this game works best as a solitary experience and My rating is for the solo variant. I haven't had a better solo experience with any other game. Because of a very steep learning curve you need to dedicate to this game. However, the more you play it the better it gets.

I should say off the top that this game is brilliant. There's so much good to talk about - the brain-busting deck and mana management, the endless variety of randomization and customization, the sheer beauty of the thing, the fact that you can BURN MONASTERIES(!) - so let's determine what's holding the game back from a perfect 10. That's simple enough: it's ridiculously hard to set up, learn, and play. My first walk-through game took three hours of setup time and seven hours(!) to play. Subsequent games will surely improve on that, but ... yikes. I should mention I did this solo, with no one to help me learn. I'd love to introduce this game to friends, but I don't think any of mine would have the patience or stamina for it. I'm glad I did - I had a blast with it - but I'll need to be feeling really energetic to try again simply because of the time involved. I hope I manage - it really is a great game.

2010 Played two incomplete solo games after reading the walkthrough and watching a video review or two.  Still having moments of discovery with the rules.  Looking to play to completion this time.

After 6 plays: The puzzle aspect of this game are working for me at the moment.

I always give negative reviews a gander and noticed the thing about resolving combat differently on enemies, allies, yourself and PvP.  Its true, annoying and not intuitive but I suspect most players are willing to overlook this and other faults because this games strengths are evident.

Reminds me of Decision Games solo D-Day game (also had a significant puzzle elements) which I like alot but this is considerably less frustrating.  The character advancement and exploration elements make sure that even if you are having a bad game you have a sense of progress.

2013 For people that have not been playing CCG, LCG alot in recent years the barrier of entry is quite high.  I have a pathfinder card game that you can take straight off the shelf and play the same night (missing the smallest nuances of the game does not seem to be a game breaker with Pathfinder).  I suspect that I will always have to give myself a week of study (reading rules and playing the basic scenario) before I play this game.  I have even set up the walkthrough scenario despite having played the game before.  Hoping to teach someone else the game a week Thursday and have only just got to the point where I think this is possible.

Reminds me of Magic Realm but ulimately I favour this game.  Both have lot of sub-systems and replayability but the Euro/CCG genetics have produced a game with a much better rule set.

Upsides:
Fun subsystems
Character advancement and variety
Re-playability
No dice rolling
Feel like you can always play the game better
Emersive

Downsides:
Lots of subsytems
Characters lack initial variety
Combat lacks elegance
Victory feels like a separate element to progress
You can either beat an an opponent with your card hand or you can't no element of tension

I always had a problem about timing a change from general game play to banking a victory.  A lot of games require a change in gameplay from say accumilating wealth etc towards victory conditions.  This game has a similar turning point where the city/s should become the entire focus of your gameplay.  As a solo player I am totally incapable of breaking off from general play early enough or forming a sensible plan for the last turn.

I'm hoping by teaching someone else how to play the game I can use competitive urges to focus my gameplay at winning rather that the accumulation of cards, fame, units etc.  I suspect I will not get better at the solo game without a bit of player interation.

2015 The game does require a bit of investment before you can play (mostly re-reading the rules).  This has kept this game off my table for a while.

I love this game, it is in my top 5! It is complex and yet so well streamlined that only Grandmaster Chvatil could have done something like this. No dices, no random effects and still every game is different, even going solo (I played it solo a lot!)

but... 

I hate spending half an hour setting this up. And I hate to "waste" at least one hour to explain the rules to newbies, even if they are hardcore gamers. 

Too complicated to be in the top ten of all times, but still it will always fit in mine for sure

This is the greatest board game I have ever played. Ever. I've played solo, cooperative, and competitive scenarios. They're all incredibly enjoyable. I've never left comments before on any website as far as a board game, but after about the 20th time of playing this game, I have to say I can't get enough and left glowing reviews both on Amazon and on this website. Leaves Twilight Struggle, Through The Ages, Android:Netrunner, etc. in the dust as far as replay value. After reading negative reviews (mainly by users who I believe were either playing the game incorrectly or couldn't figure out the rules), I had to step in and let everyone know just how great this game is.

This game provides experience like a score: 10 one would do but -and this is such a big but what makes me to lower my score by 2- it has one of the worst rulebook to one of the most complex game what I've ever played. Also this is one of the longest games what I have or ever played which makes hard to find enough time and people who would choose this over a few complete playthrough of shorter games.

Absolutely amazing solitaire experience. This is the type of game you can ruminate over with a snifter of brandy and a pipe. Have yet to play it multiplayer, but then again why would I?

Took me four attempts at just the solo walk through to finish a game. Shit is tough to work out at night when I'm so tired. It's got the many tiny rules of dungeon lords but way more in terms of payoff. An "8" after just that first stupid mission, but might end up a "10". I can see the appeal.

Seems epic and open ended. but it also seems to largely come down to killing monsters...I suppose that is RPG boardgames in a nutshell

no luck in action outcomes but luck in what you can choose to do in a turn (cards - actgion resources available) didn't really sit well with me for the theme. Also it starts off pretty slow and by the time I had the power to do much I was bored.
proably much better as a 2player game.

Rating after 6 solo conquest plays 

Great solo game. You have to make a lot of tough but interesting choices (rating +2) and you can shape your hero through skills and deck builing (rating +1). The game is also thematic and progression - i.e. hero power vs challenges - feels right (rating +1). The game rivals Agricola and Le Havre – my favourite solo games - but I suspect it has more replayability.  Like these two brainburning titles much of the gameplay is deterministic and you are trying to be as efficient as possible. However, Mage Knight is much more random: most importantly card draws and mana dice rolls are of crucial importance. I am not against the randmomness [i] per se [/i], as it adds replyability, but I think that movement is too costly: if changing your position was less expensive you could manage the randomness of card draws /mana rolls better.  (rating -2) I guess the problem would be worse in multiplayer as you often have to take boring “move a hex” turns and then wait for others to complete their turns. 

The game can be difficult to learn: there are many details that have to be memorized. However, the rules are coherent and all of the rules seem to have a purpose, i.e. no complexity for the sake of it. The rulebook is well written (rating +1), although there are exceptions (such as not presenting rules for solo play in one place). The production quality is disappointing: misaligned printing of cards and tiles and the material of the cards, which makes sleeving a necessity (rating -1). I am not sure how to rate graphical design and art. Some of it is great but some is rather awful, e.g. color scheme of the lizardman's skills.

Pros: lots of neat mechanics come together to provide plenty of depth, strategy and options.  Art and components are great.  Variable scenarios, variable player powers and tiles provide replayability.

Potential for higher rating after more games!

Likes:
- Much to do on the growing map - exploring dungeons and the like is something I always loved in games like Master of Magic or the Heroes of Might and Magic series (eagerly waiting for THAT game, btw). MK does this well, superior to others
- Quick successes
- Not as heavy as it seems; rules are overwhelming, while the game isn't really that complicated once you've got the basic run-down. You'll have to read up on the features of special places occasionally, but that's mostly it. Don't be afraid of the rules, there's worse.
- PvP can be skipped; i hate PvP
- Super material

Dislikes:
- Too much to do for the, all in all, limited time in most scenarios (if there's more time in a scenario, it'll take forever...)
- Downtime (even bad in a 2p, might work out better with more experience)
- Characters are all the same at the start - why? They could have skipped on them altogether and made wooden meeples in different colors. There should have been at least some tiny difference from the start "Ah this is more the magician type, this the healer, that the tank..."; or slightly different decks towards this direction (it's possible to balance this stuff, as other games prove)
- There's not much deck-building actually; everyone starts with the same deck and there's NOT that many new cards to come by really. I don't like deck-building much, but if it's a mechanic anyway, it'd better work well enough to make it worthwhile.
- Deck-building itself makes no sense - why do I have to wait for some decent card to successfully attack something standing right next to me? Having a walk around it fatigues me and my troops too, that's no excuse.

Sounds a bit rough, but I actually do like it.

UPDATE:
It's getting worse (before it get's better...?). Second game was more exhausting than our day job. It's more fun to prepare your taxes (and less complicated). Well...

Man, this is a beast.  I think I have to do a refresher course every time I get a chance to pull it out and play (which is not very often).  It is a great game by a great designer and I love how great it is solo! Never even played it with another human as I don't want to try to teach it! But it is a great game with knocks against it being so long and fiddly/complex.  Took me a year or so to build up the courage to even try it, but glad I did! Save it for days when the family is away!

Played like twice a day every day for the week before Christmas. Very fun, but... it's a nightmare for AP-prone players. We have had turns that have lasted > 15 minutes... for one player. Often a player's turn is simply a puzzle to solve, and it's not obvious whether the puzzle is solvable. Fighting multiple monsters at the same time late game can bring the game to a dead halt.

Perfect balance of theme, mechanics, and weight. When I want to run around exploring and adventuring, this is my game. One of the few games I enjoy solo (but also like the 2-player). Multi-use cards here are awesome. Really dislike teaching this one. Almost exclusively a game for me, as my husband has fallen out of favor with it. Makes it really hard to get to the table, and these days, if I'm going to carve out the time to play it solo, I'd rather play something else with my husband.

Wow. Just wow.

This is a fantastic game.

You've probably read every praises on this game, but they are true.

Here's what I love about it: very puzzle-y (you have to use your hand to the most effective effect on each turn), your character progresses through a deck-building mechanism, there is a little dice rolling, the fights are tough (even brutal), there are multiple scenarios, several playing modes (including solo!), the minis are nice and the artwork is fine.

Beware that this is a complex game, with lot of rules and can last several hours.

If you're into this kind of game, this one will devour your time.

This game was *intimidating* when I first began reading through the walkthrough and rules. It took me a solid 3 nights of setting-up / learning the beginners scenario to get comfortable enough with the mechanics and rules to begin playing a real scenario. 
That being said, it is a wonderful game!!!! A perfect game for a solo player (with a lot of free time, since the set-up takes a bit and the game can take quite a while to play), this one was well worth the learning curve. I would highly recommend it: very high quality, tons of replayability.

Things I like about Mage Knight:

* It captures an "adventuring" feel
* It has a good variety of loot (skills, spells, artifacts), while keeping some of it rare/hard to get so it always feels like there is more to discover
* There's a good mix of deterministic calculation (figuring out how to play cards in a combat, for example) along with push-your-luck decisions (should I delve into this dungeon in search of treasure if I know I can beat 4 out of 5 possible monsters I'll run into?)
* Time is of the essence; there are always more things available to do than you realistically have time for, leading to hard/challenging decisions
* It plays great solo

Things I don't like about Mage Knight:

* Theme (disclaimer: never read the books) - the "heroes" are basically big jerks running around sacking the land because some nebulous Council wants them to
* The game sometimes ends just as you feel like you're getting well equipped
* Luck of the draw/hand management can sometimes be frustrating (no Move cards?! I don't want to discard three otherwise-valuable actions for moves!)
* With more than 1 player, analysis paralysis can become a serious bother - much of the game is figuring out how best to optimize your actions. The rules explicitly encourage "reverting" moves (as long as they don't reveal new information) instead of trying to think everything out beforehand, but even so it can be a lot of brain burning to figure out the optimal move for a turn

RATING: 6
I was very excited about this game before we get it and at the beginning. 

The components are great, idea is neat, art work is pretty cool. I really like how the game looks overall. I like the mana system and day/night turns affecting how you play the game. If you have the right cards at hand at the right time, you feel very powerful! I like that. 

When we were learning the game we felt there were so many rules, it was tough and I said we should not try to play this with new people, it takes long teach but things soon make sense, main rules are mostly intuitive. 

Here comes my complaints:

1) My biggest complaint is whenever we play we always get stuck in one or two rounds. It is as if the game is trying to sabotage you at least half the time. 

2) Co-operative play hardly feels co-operative. We need to always remind ourselves that we are not competing, but how is it possible if there is an individual point track system moving all the time? It almost feels like the game is forced to be co-operative just as an additional edge. 

3) Also, it is possible that as you move along in the game you can get some analysis paralysis situations since there could be many combinations to consider, spells to choose from, etc.. While the other person plays, you feel like taking a break or, if too frustrated, start reading a book.

I really wanted to like this game... We will still keep it though. I think I can play it if I am really in the mood for some half sabotaging-half rewarding, good looking game.

Only solo games thus far. Great melange of mechanics, need to play with others.

Update Nov 2016: Played several coop games with friends. Mage Knight delivers as a heavy, puzzly adventure game with a very satisfying power curve. Building your deck, planning your round and maximizing your turns is a rewarding experience, making you feel incredibly stupid and/or wicked smart in a matter of minutes. Only play with people who are in for the long haul, as a full game tends to occupy several (fun/exhausting) hours.

The way the cards are used are novel, and the game is well executed.  However, it is a bit too complicated and fiddly for what it does, and our games have ended up boiling down to the same puzzle of "move and kill monster - how can I do that with the cards I have?"  If it had found some way to make the other actions more viable (gaining cards of course is necessary) I think it would shine even more than it has... Hmm maybe I just need to play this again. I just don't want to relearn the rules!

I love this game. I cannot express with words just how amazing this game is. Yes, it is a beast. There is a bunch going on in the game, making this a no-go for people who are new to the hobby. However, if you enjoy a rich, deep experience with a plethora of choices and avenues, this is the game for you.

***WARNING*** Do not play this with more than two people. It can easily take 3 hours with just one if you're new. 2 is the max.

This game seems really well designed and deep, I'm not sure it's for me simply because the setup and mechanics will take so much time. This is an example of a board game that feels like it would work better as a video game with the mechanics hidden under the hood. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I really love this game.

The rulebook is hefty but the play is logical and after the first two or so plays we haven't had the need to look the rules up again. Draw your card hand -> smack down cards on your turn -> draw up to hand limit at the end of your turn -> rinse and repeat until your deck is empty -> a new day and a freshly suffled deck.

I love how you have to balance the risk/reward ratio. Knowing your deck and what you might reasonably be expected to tackle with it is the key to the victory. And victory points come from so many categories (besides the scenario main objective) that usually all the players have a chance at winning atleast one of the categories.

Sometimes turns can last a bit long as players optimize their moves and fights. A natural result since the combats happen without rolling damage dice or other such luck dependant things. It works very well.

The theme of the game and the components are also solid.

RATING: 10
SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum
4 Player Maximum
The game mechanics are really neat. You have total control. There is a steep learning curve and two rulebooks. This game makes my head hurt.

SET UP NOTES:
-Set Up board and cards as suggested on page 2 of rule book. (Advanced Actions, Fame & Reputation Board, Spells, Wounds and Artifacts.)
-Add three Advanced Actions and three Spells for initial offer.
-Shuffle Silver Unit Cards and add # of actual player +2 to the Unit Offer. (Note: Advanced Gold Units are available at the end of a round after a Core Tile has been placed.)
-Shuffle Monster Tokens, leave them in the Plano boxes.
-Create Tile Deck according to Scenario details. Shuffle brown Core Tiles together, shuffle green Countryside tiles and place on top of shuffled brown Core Tiles.
-Place START TILE, open or wedge based on Scenario, draw 2 or 3 tiles (based on start tile, wedge or open.) Place them oriented to the start tile. Place appropriate Monster Tokens on beginning tile.
-Set Up DUMMY PLAYER, need hero card and place 3 corresponding Crystals on it, shuffle 16 starting cards. IF SOLO use nine non interactive Skill Tokens and skill description.
-Roll MANA DICE, # of actual player +2, set on Day/Night Board.
-HAND LIMIT, Each Player draws up to their Hand Limit.
-SELECT TACTICS CARDS, begin game.

RULES NOTES:
-DUMMY PLAYER TURN: flip over 3 cards. If top card matches any crystals on hero card flip over more cards equal to number of same colored crystals. If Deed Deck is empty at start of turn, "announce end of turn" all other players have one more turn until round is over.
-RAMPAGING ENEMIES: Auto attack if you move from an adjacent space to a different adjacent space to the same enemy. You may optionally attack a Rampaging Enemy from an adjacent space. You cannot ever be in the same space as a a Rampaging Enemy. Maurading Orcs and Draconium are the only Rampaging Enemies.
-REGULAR TURN: May Move, then may do ONE Action. Must Move before you do one Action.

Being an enthusiastic MK player some yeras ago I simply had to have this. 

Unfortunately, while it is, by itself, a decent game, it is overloaded with mechanisms you have to look up all the time. I also severely miss some real player interaction, and the opponents seem to become weaker and weakre as the characters you play quickly rise in strength.

The kind of game that could be a hit, but isn't because of the game group. I really feel like this game shines with 2 players.
Unfortunately, I rarely play 2 players, we're usually 4, so it really didn't work out, it dragged too much.

RATING: 8
Huge, huge beast. Masterful game. It took too much time, energy and will to get this game in your blood. But it is very rewarding once you did.
I rated this lower because of the long setup and playtime and also thanks to pretty hard gameplay, but over a time I increased it a lot and now this game is just a bit under a perfect 10.
There is still a lot of commitment to play this game - you need a time and a right mindset to play this.
But when you feel you want a game of Mage Knight, it delivers.

Also there are a bunch of custom scenarios to play, you can always find something new there (not that the original scenarios wasn't enough for one lifetime to play)

My second favorite Vlaada Chvatil Game and arguably my most complex one.

  I played through once. Didn't know what the hell I was doing. I but I have a much better handle on the flow of the game. Some people say you get an RPG feel out of it. You do, kinda. But there is a lot of problem solving going on. That part is actually epic. 

I can see that it's an epic game. To me, I see it as Dark Tower 2.0. I have a very long way to go, though, in my understanding of the game's strategy.

For now, I will give it an 7 because I see tons of potential. But the flavor of the game is a bit different than what I anticipated. However, I think the game will be more fun than I had anticipated. It will just deliver that fun, differently. 

My score will likely go up as I get more familiar with game play. 

Also, I do not find the game as difficult as some make it out to be in terms of learning the mechanics of the game. 

Update: still learning but playing it, too. And this game really has me excited about the strategy and choices involved. 

A side note: War games are typically a lot more complicated than regular games. Even though the weight on Mage Knight is the highest of any game I own, the three COIN games I have and the Lock n Load Tactical games are faaaaaar more difficult to play than Mage Knight. And both sets of wargames are of medium complexity for wargames. That should tell you a lot about the wargame hobby. And that is why I'm hardly a genuine grognard, through and through.

I love the theme and the way this game plays. City battles in the end of a scenario can be rather annoying with all the calculations you have to do, but it is not a game breaker. The game length is also a minus, but other than the previously mentioned I can't think of any bad sides to this game. Also, being able to play the game solo means that this game will frequently hit my table.

If you hate fantasy games or long games, don't buy this. Otherwise, I highly recommend this game.

I feel like this game could be awesome if I had a group of people with whom I played it regularly. That way (a) we could remember all the rules game-to-game; (b) we could figure out a way to lay out all the pieces efficiently; (c) we could work up to some of the more involved scenarios; and (d) we could play quickly enough that if one player got locked out of doing interesting things for a few turns in a row that their downtime wouldn't be so bad.

RATING: 6
Far too much downtime for me.  I would strongly suggest this game not be played with 4 players.  While the choices are often interesting and there is a lot of variety, the mechanics of movement and combat made it seem like a solitaire game more than anything else.  And a solitaire-feeling game with tons of downtime is a serious drawback for me.  The rules are also fairly terrible, with scatterings of details strewn about two different rule books that try to address the same thing.  I would like to try this with 2 players before I render a final judgment, but this may not be the game for me despite me really wanting to like it!

Buenísimo! Eso si, hay que tomárselo con calma, y saber a lo que vas: Es un juego muy exigente que requiere mucho tiempo, y ser capaz de manejar bastante información a la vez. A los no-jugones es raro que les guste, y les suele tirar para atrás. Pero a los casos perdidos que les guste la temática, un juego de aventuras/exploración/RPG muy muy bueno. Recomendable probar una partida para terminar de entender (hay un modo tutorial bastante completo y didáctico), y extremadamente recomendable que te lo enseñe alguien que ya ha jugado con anterioridad.
Una pena la cantidad de defectos que suelen tener los componentes. El control de calidad de Wizkids debe ser el peor del mundo de los juegos de mesa... Es lo que me frena comprarme este juego.

Greatest Hits Remix - This has a lot of mechanics that come from other great games, and they actually work with each other *and* the theme quite well.  This game has a lot going on and won't fit on a card table.

Not enough play to definitively rate yet, but I must say I like it and I see potential for greatness.

Role selection determining turn order as in Citadels
Deckbuilding as seen in Dominion
Card driven action as in Commands & Colors and Elfenland
Resource drafting as in Elfenland
Various terrain movement costs as in Elfenland / wargames
Non random combat with abilities as in Magic: the Gathering
Recruiting followers similar to summoning creatures as in Magic: the Gathering
Day/Night cycle affecting visibility and available resources as in Terraria
Achievement scoring as in Settlers of Catan
Level up system gives different rewards on even and odd levels as in D&D 4E.
Hex tile based exploration as in Eclipse/others

I always want fantasy adventure boardgame. But aside from Magic Realm, no game ever reach the "goodness" that I want. They're either too much luck or too simple. Of course there are some good fantasy dungeon game (like descent, claustrophobia), but what I want is more on adventure side. And then came Mage Knight.

- Randomized Map
- Variable player power
- Cunning play over luck (luck can be minimized a lot)
- Units to command
- Various skills, advances, and spell
- Flavorful enemies, locations, and adventures.
- So many scenarios to adjust playability

They answer almost everything I need. And the expansions make it better. This is a very heavy game. Not for boardgame newbie.

Wow, This game is amazing.  Don't get me wrong I still like runebound, but this game takes the cake.  The card driven system allows the player total control over what his character will do, so a lot of stategy is used even before playing your first card.  I love the fact that this game is challeging and yet still gives you the feeling that you have total control.  Also love the fact that the characters are actually different from one another. Can't wait to play some co-op and pvp games once i really get used to the game.  gotten two recon games in so far.

RATING: 10
A complex and challenging fantasy themed game but once you invest the time to learn it, it's hugely rewarding.

Involves recruiting armies (or "units"), fighting monsters, some deck-building, leveling up your Mage Knight character and exploration to conquer keeps, mage towers, cities and more.  

You can sometimes be unlucky with your hand so your turn can be a little frustrating when you can't achieve what you were hoping for, but I think that can be the case with any deck building game.  Mage Knight is about the challenge of making the most of your hand at any one time.

Overall, a beautifully designed game.  The creators have given us lots of different ways to play as well: solo, cooperative, competitive and also with different types of quests/scenarios.  (There's lots of fan made variants as well).  Blooming hate the 2 rulebooks though... 

This game has a steep learning curve, but it really is epic awesome-ness in a box.

I recommend watching Ricky Royal's (Box of Delights) playthrough videos for learning how to play.

Components: Great graphics. Nice iconography. Quality tiles. Too many pieces for my tastes, though.

Experience: Sooo much going on. It should be simple that on my turn I move and take an action. But there are so many different ways to permutate my cards, the game moves along at a snail's pace. Like Chvátil's other games, this one is all about balance: trying to excel in many different areas at once. I can't imagine playing some of the more difficult scenarios.

I think I have played it enough to conclude that, despite its multitude of lovely components, its pretty artwork, its cleverness piled upon cleverness, Mage Knight is still, simply this - bash, collect, improve, bash, collect, improve, [i]ad nauseum[/i].  At the time when a board game comes closest to being RPG-but-not-an-RPG, MK is at its core, just another RPG - bash, collect, improve.  Rinse and repeat.

Can a lot of boardgames we revere on this site be damned for the same sin of iterative processes?  Certainly, but not all are equally guilty of iteration solely for the sake of iteration.  Mr. Chvatil has done well, to tuck this away behind card management, deck-building, shared dice usage, and several other aspects that elicit oohs and aahs, but play it enough, and you'll find the man behind the curtain.

And while some will find that man a very likeable creature, I for one find him dull and repetitive.

This is one of the only games in my collection that comes close to playing better solitaire than with meaties.  Vlaada is a genius and this is his best accomplishment to date.

Okay, after several plays, I'm upgrading this from a Thumbs Up (6) to Top Shelf (9). It took me several plays to get comfortable with all of the rules and options, so now I can quickly assess my exploration options and rapidly resolve combat. As many have said, learning not to fear wounds (as long as you have enough firepower to complete the kill afterwards) is key. I usually like my adventure games to be less deterministic, but the more I play MK, the more I see dealing with the randomness (i.e., risk management) to be an important part of the game. 

It could also be that I was only truly satisfied when adding the expansion, so I'm not sure that the base game itself warrants this high a rating.

Immense.  Yes, it has a learning curve.  It's worth learning.  There's plenty of videos out there that will set you straight (Ricky Royal I recommend for this) and once you get going - it's not that hard.  stringing together a combination from your hand and pulling off a great move is so satisfying.  Brilliant game.  I felt compelled to sleeve the cards which in itself was unusual for me, but I was happy once I had done.  Not many games make me want to sleeve them but sitting there playing around with your hand of cards going "oooh - maybe!" for a while, well - the cards are going to get knackered so probably a good call.

Greatest solitaire game ever designed. Brilliant!

Sadly, I had to downgrade this to an 8 due to not playing after more than a year. This game requires too much mental effort from me to solve the "puzzles" the game states present. I do want to return to it eventually.

7/3/2017: I finally returned to it and was surprised that I didn't have to learn it again from scratch, but just watch some videos and brush up on some topics. I had a lot of fun and enjoyed it, but I did walk away from it with a headache and only 5 hours sleep. This is one best taken in small doses.

RATING: 10
In my opinion, this is as close to perfection as a board game can get. Mage Knight feels much like a CRPG crossed with Heroes of Might and Magic in board game format. It's ridiculously deep and detailed. It has a steep learning curve and long playtime, but once you get into a groove time absolutely flies when playing this. The introductory scenarios do a good job of easing players into the game.  If I were stuck on a deserted island and could take one game with me, this would be it.

RATING: 7
I love love love the components in this game. The art is incredible, the quality is great, the painted miniatures are wonderful.

Somehow I never quite get into this game as much as I want to. Partially I find the movement rules overly restrictive (I'd prefer to feel like I'm running around the board more) partially I find the player-NPC combat boring. Mostly, I think I would just prefer to play a computer/video RPG game than Mage Knight.

In my limited experience there appeared to be a rich-get-richer scoring mechanism that I need to investigate further.

RATING: 8
There are a lot of moving parts in this game which is essentially tabletop 'Heroes of Might and Magic'. Plays best at two, I think, and solo is also very fun. More than three players and you're asking for crushing boredom, there's serious downtime between turns in this game.

It's a very ingenious design, held back by the downtime and complex setup. The rules overhead is significant as well but not a problem after a few plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's extremely long, there are two difficult rulebooks, and player interaction is at a minimum, especially given the fact that the PvP rules are absolutely inscrutable.

BUT. There is no better feeling than getting your hand of cards to work just right, to align your crystals and mana and units and special abilities to get that spell you agonized over last turn to go off just right and bring down that city full of imposing knights or that dragon circling the mountain or that summoner who surprised you in the labyrinth. It's a deeply challenging puzzle whose components you can curate, whose effects are powerful and, by the end of the game, that tells a satisfying story. It's not a perfect game but, given all that, I'm not sure I care.

We played for four hours to get through one day and one night of a three-and-a-half day co-op scenario.  My friends ended up finishing it in another session; ten hours overall.  I wasn't sorry to have missed it.

Mage Knight is too long, too slow and too dry.  It's like doing your taxes in boardgame form.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A highly recommendable game for solo-players who like a fantasy setting and do not mind playing a somewhat shady character.

The main characteristic of the game is the interesting mix between randomness and calculation: the situations you face during the game are subject to a lot of random elements (a random map, random enemies placed on the map and in cities, random units for hire/spells/advanced actions changing from round to round) to an extent that each play is likely to be unique. On the other hand, the randomness ends when the player begins to act (safe for entering adventure sites where you randomly draw the inhabitant upon entry). The player knows what they can do in their turn. They can calculate the outcome of any battle before starting it. Thus, with the abovementioned exception, you will never encounter the dreaded situation of a single die roll thwarting your attack.

Mage Knight requires you to think about the best way to use your hand in each turn, how to go about combat and what challenges to face. All of these turn into myriads of more detailed decisions. 

Therefore, Mage Knight can easily become a brainy game. However, I have the feeling that the braininess is still bearable for the average and casual player (borderline for the latter).

Besides requiring thinking about your actions, the other limitation the game provides is the time setup takes (lots of different decks and chit tiles) as well as how long individual plays can take.

Still, I think that the game is very rewarding and thanks to the variability offering great replayability even for solo-players.

Nice to own a game which is playable as cooperative game for a full evening; learning curve rather steep, but rules itself are not that complex; just learning how to play well will take some time. Game has different appealing aspects combined, such as adventure, battling, planning and hand management; prone to AP, but with little downtime as players are constantly planning, also during turns of other players. Besides, when playing as a co-op game players can make all decisions together.

One play so far. Very good/Great border. If playtime decreases like we have found with TTA, then pretty darn amazing.
Update: A dozen plays in, rating adjusted upwards. A lot to this game. Highly immersive.  Played to almost 1am without realizing it! Still lengthy. I think the time is coming down, but not as quickly as it did with TTA as we are still seeing different cards/effects coming into play.

Played 2x, 1 3-player, 1 solo.
This is a puzzle game under the guise of a dungeon crawler RPG. But what a fun puzzle it is! The whole game boils down to hand management, light deck-building. The map is just there for deciding which targets to risk for their reward, since movement costs cards, attacking costs cards, and pretty much doing anything costs cards.

Mage Knight is a little rulesy, but I had some teach me the game who was comfortable doing so.  There was a lot going on but it all made thematic sense.  
I liked how the skills and upgrades worked.  The combat was fun.  And. Puzzling out each turn was fun.
The movement across the map was interesting.  But it was a bit restrictive.
Seems like a solid game if you do not mind heavy rules.  I need some more plays before I know for sure.  For now it is a keeper.

Very good adventure game, with strong strategy and planning elements. Which is a change from games with similar theme that rely on dies rolling

Looks a bit complex at first, but after a couple of game, it works very well.

It use a simple deck building engine to allow for the various actions of the game. each card as a free basic effect, but you can get a more powerful effect if you can pay a mana of the card color. 
This is an elegant mechanism, that allow for a lot of combinations, without to much complecity.

One of the most clever and absorbing games I have played.  It's really a hand management game...figuring out how to play your cards in just the right way to get what you need.  But there are so many different ways to do things that you will often start out planning to do it one way but find a different way of doing it that is more efficient part way through your turn. Somehow the theme manages to come through and produce some great stories, and no game will ever be the same. A fantastic solitaire game, but plays well with 2 and 3, although it starts to slow down with 3--some heavy AP can set in with some players.  Never with four! Highly recommended!

Too bad this is so long and difficult to teach...I would love to play more.

What can I say... My friend Kevin introduced me to this game.  We played twice.  I bought it.  I pretty much am addicted to this game.
It is not for the faint of heart, heavy on the rules (I am still figuring it out for some of the finer points and advanced cards), but well worth it.  Each play is a different adventure, and the difficulty level is just right, due to the adjusted scenarios and cooperative-competition scenarios.

They should call this crack in cardboard form with a side of minifigure crystal meth.

Vlaada Chvátil ha vuelto a conseguirlo. Mecánicas que le van como un guante a este juego, buena ambientación, suficiente variedad como para no aburrirse del juego en mucho tiempo, en fin, una verdadera joya. No soy fan de los juegos de fantasía/aventuras, quizá todo lo contrario, sin embargo este me ha encantado, cada turno es un reto, planificar tus próximos movimientos, revisar lo que puedes o no puedes hacer con tus cartas, en fin, que me parece un juego muy bueno.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It seems to be the best game as an adventure-type slay monsters and level up type of game. Magic Realm is just too outdated and overly-complex. MK, while not perfect, is a reasonable alternative. An Ameritrash game that takes a lot of unnecessary randomness out--a hybrid then? What's more is that it is a good game to play solo, although I much prefer it multiplayer. My gripes with it (admittedly minor) are the ugly card art and miniature figurines. The art is good quality, in fact, but the depiction of human(oid) creatures is where it fails. The art on the cards is very colorful and effective, and certainly is an improvement over cards with no art at all. 

I'm not a huge fan of deck-building, but there's enough of the game outside of this mechanic to make it fun. It's more hand management than deckbuilding, since you aren't required to discard your hand at the end of your turn, and aside from Wounds, there aren't any completely useless cards (I'm looking at you, Dominion). The icons work well, and I have to mention that the art and site locations on the terrain tiles are of excellent quality and make for very clear gameplay. This game is certainly heavy and fiddly with a few rules exceptions, but it's worth every bit of the struggle to get there. Everything is thematically intuitive as well as important for game balance. 

Oh, and in case it matters, I know nothing of the original Mage Knight minis game or the MK setting.

I rate it a 9.5 as a two or three player game. I rate it a 7 as a solo and co-op game (I dislike using an artificial timer, plus I'm generally averse to solo games in general). I haven't played it with 4 yet. I imagine I would enjoy it as long as it was with fast players who are very comfortable with the game. Full Conquest is my favorite scenario, but I also enjoy Druid Nights and Mines Liberation for variety. In Full Conquest, I play mainly 2 player, and use the variant to add 1 extra countryside tile and 1 extra non-city core tile to setup. This allows for some extra Fame to be earned. We were conquering the cities well-before the end of the 3rd night because we were running out of places outside the cities to get Fame. 

19 of my logged plays are solo, which don't really count for a game that can be played multiplayer.

Pros:
- Thematic deckbuilding mechanism that works naturally to show character growth. Progression in a single session is satisfying.
- Challenging hand management puzzle per turn, balancing card efficiency, mana crystals and tokens, and tempo in relation to your opponents.
- Choosing between advanced actions, skills, spells, and artifact cards for your deck is a fun challenge.
- Highly replayable with random tile exploration and multiple scenario types and multiple asymmetrical mage knight characters.
- Plays well solo, but also plays well at other player counts as long as there is enough time set aside to play.
- Has a good 2 rulebook system and rule aid cards.
- Expanded with rebalanced cards and new mechanics and content. Wished they added another set of Tactic cards.
- Prepainted minis and useful castle hero click figures. Good quality for board game level (not miniatures level).

Cons:
- Cards material is of good quality but ink can run and fade with use. Must sleeve.
- Long game, minimum hour per player, and suffers with AP prone players.
- Despite good rulebooks, difficult to play correctly out of the box due to the sheer number of rules and concepts to learn.
- The setup takes me about 15 minutes with experience and without special storage solutions. Not bad box insert already helps.
- No campaign mode for those who desire it.

I picked this up in May of 2013.  I've only played solo games so far, but it's a game that I just can't get out of my head.  Playing solo it takes me about 60-90 minutes to complete a solo conquest.

I do not recommend playing w/ 4 players w/o PvP rules at all - it was a miserable experience for the 4th player because everything was cleared out before the player could get to it.

I could see playing this again with 2 or 3 and with PvP rules.  It had more gameplay than most similar games to it but a huge amount of AP as players had to try to figure out how best to deal with their hands given only one mana crystal per turn from the dice.

2/8/13: Played our first game with the optional 'drafting' rules where you and each other player gets a had of 4 randomly drawn advanced actions, that you then draft until you have your four top picks.  You then get to put one in your deck at the end of each day round.  This made the game feel a lot easier, but also gave me a chance to see how nicely the game flows.  We also had the expansion enemy tokens and the new basic and advanced units in the offer, which really helped vary things.

Thematically beautiful and featuring a well designed RPG character progression system, Mage Knight is unfortunately ruined by its core card-playing mechanic. Cards should not have been required for movement (at least) as it leads far too often to entire Rounds ruined by cards being drawn in the wrong order. For a game with this much start-up time and rules heaviness this is unacceptable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Excellent theme game that really accomplishes what it sets out to do. As proof of this, Mage Knight is the only game where I don't really care too much whether I win or lose (and I'm extremely competitive). I'm simply focusing on leveling my character. The possibilities to adjust play time, difficulty etc. are great. Due to extreme down time I would recommend to play with time limits if you use 3-4 players. Fixed some minor randomness issues. I suspect this game eventually will come to rest on a solid 9...

RATING: 4
After a few plays in, rating hasn't really changed. It's definitely better as a 2-player game. With more the game can really drag and the playing time can balloon out of control, all without really adding anything to the game play experience. I'd probably refuse to play with more than 2 in the future except perhaps as a co-op.

There are a lot of bits to remember with this game, more than many wargames really. The deck building aspect is good but only if you play a longer game. Otherwise you just won't see a payoff on your card investment, which rather defeats the purpose. The deterministic combat means that if both players are doing equally well, the game will come down to the luck of the tile and monster draws. If it's NOT close then it will just be torture for the lagging players because there's no catchup mechanism in the competitive game, and they'll suffer for another 2 hours as the game finally lumbers to conclusion.

I dunno. At the end of the day I just don't know how much fun I'm getting out of it. It's supposed to be an adventure game, but one never really gets the feeling of any kind of narrative being generated, and it's too long. I just think there are other fantasy games out there that do a better job.

After revisiting Mage Knight a few years later, I feel like I have to adjust my rating. I still think that the game feels fiddly and there are a lot small rules details. But for some reason, I did enjoy the puzzle that is your turn a lot more this time. Maybe I've come to peace with Vlaada Chvátil's abundant design style since something similar happened with Dungeon Lords. I just had a good time with this rules heavy beast and I'm looking forward to play it again. Although I'm certain that I don't want to play this one with more than two players.

I really wanted to like Mage Knight as it has some of my favorite mechanisms. Deck- and combo building coupled with a lot of puzzle solving (in finding the best course of action while playing your cards). In the end, the game didn't really grab me. The sheer number of rules and the long play time make it hard to introduce Mage Knight to other players and the game play is far from what I would call elegant.

Maybe Mage Knight provides a better solo experience but since my enthusiasm for it has vanished, I doubt that I will revisit the game in the near future.

Uodated (increased) rating after some recent plays. I have really come to like this one a lot. Tons of replay and variability. It is real fun watching your character go from very powerful to insanely powerful as you add cards and skills. Would be a ten, but it is a bit daunting to set up and there are lots of little rules to remember. But the game is more accessible than it might initially appear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
There is absolutely no way anyone could get all, or even most, of the rules right if they were just using the printed rulebooks. By printing a player aid, the FAQ, a player made chart for city levels, and referring multiple times to BGG forums I was able to play the game.

Rules are divided between two books for no good reason at all: you can't use the walkthrough without the rulebook or vice versa so looking something up (and you have to look everything up) always means paging through two books. (Edit: At least one rule is only stated on a reference card, not in either book. Mr. Chvatil, why not just design a game called 'Rule Hunter'? You could hide rules in Easter eggs, abandoned buildings, under your hat...)

Furthermore there is no logic to the organization of either book at all. Rules that govern basic gameplay are buried in a wall of text with every possible exception. No attempt is made at all to differentiate between major and minor rules.

Not only are the rules buried in exceptions, they are literally scrambled. Want to know how to cast spells? Don't look in the rulebook, it's in the walkthrough, under "Revealing the Mage Tower (Tile 4)".

(Edit: Actually casting spells is covered in the rulebook, but there's also a place somewhere in the rulebook that refers you to the Walkthrough for the explanation, which is how I ended up there.)

Added to the problem is endless repetition and lengthy explanation of the patently obvious:

"Overview: ...each round represents either one day or one night. The first round is usually Day, which is then followed by Night, then Day, etc."

Four pages later...

"Day/Night Board: The two-sided Day/Night board shows whether it is Day or Night.... it starts with the Day side up and remains like this for the entire first round. When the round ends it flips over to the Night side."

Wow. So night follows day. Astonishing.

If you took a normal rulebook, shrank the font to near microscopic size, made two copies of it, stuffed them all in the barrel of a shotgun, fired it into a blender, and then divided the wreckage in two halves you would get a similar effect.

Rating of 5 includes a -3 deduction for rules.

Yes, it is a good game, if you have the patience to learn it.


Edit: the searchable pdf, found here, would probably help a lot:
http://wizkidsgames.com/wp-content/uploads/mage/MK_rulebook_ENG_searchable-mar2012.pdf

...but I still don't ever want to look at this game again. At this point I don't even like to look at the box. It's in a drawer until my next auction.

Edit: Got a chance to play with a very experienced player guiding us tonight. I thought this might make it possible to enjoy the game. It was much better to ask him 3 or more questions every turn than to search the rulebook for answers, but the end result is the same: Mage Knight is unplayable. It would make a fine app. As a board game the rules and exceptions are far too numerous to adjudicate. Unless it is intended as a gift for obsessive pre-teens with countless hours to fill, this is not something I would recommend.

I'm not a fan of the movement in this game.  It's boring to have to sit and wait for enough movement cards to get to where you need to go, or burn otherwise useful cards as a one step.  Otherwise, I think it's probably an interesting system that I'm interested in exploring more.

Mage Knight is a wonderful game and I love it to bits. Norowas is my perfect son. It's also really not as complex as people make it out to be - once you've played it a couple of times it becomes second nature and a lot of things can easily be looked up on the reference cards (e.g. can I use units in this fight, how many tan tokens do I draw etc).

Also shout out to the Mage Knight Dummy Player app for Android (maybe iOS as well?) for speeding up a rather dull part of the solo game.

Interesting mix of strategy elements and  puzzle-like tactical problems. Only played it twice so far one 3-player and once solo - but an enjoyable 'Heroes of Might & Magic' romp.

It is a little bit fiddly but not too bad considering the amount of chrome that had been shoe-horned into the rule-set.

I suspect it may play too long with 4 but 3 seemed pretty good and played solo was good as well.

A bit repetitive and bland, although if you like puzzles this is a great game for you.

Initially I was amazed - however it's difficult to come back to it...

RATING: 8
Magic Realm light.  You can see all the pieces of Magic Realm redone here.  There are quite a bit fewer rules here both due to simplifying it down plus all the cards.  Instead of looking up things on charts, often you are reading cards.  Which is better is debatable.  The cards replace the chits and add an enormous amount of luck of the draw.  Sometimes you want to fight and all you have are move cards.  Sometimes you need to move to a new area of the map and all you have are fight and mana cards.  However, the combat is now more deterministic.  Some Magic Realm battles were determined by dice rolling for tactics & repositioning.  Using magic is simpler but less satisying in Mage Knight.   Chit fiddliness in Magic Realm is replaced with card and mana fiddliness in Mage Knight.  Both have complicated combat.

What Mage Knight does better :  Fewer lookups..but still a good amount.  Less harsh for finding your character in a battle he/she cannot win.  Wounds can be discarded at the cost of a turn (or so I hear).  Less complex.

What Magic Realm does better:  Everything else.  Map, Treasures, win conditions, simultaneous action (most of time), characters, non-deterministic combat, spells, etc.

Ultimately both are excellent game, but given my choice, I'd much rather play Magic Realm.  The game offers a richer experience.

Mage Knight is not only one of the best deck building games I have played but also one of the best game periods. Its mechanical strength is sufficient to pull me back into a genre (fantasy adventure games) that I had largely dismissed as trivial and not particularly interesting. I have already played it over 20 times and while my [i]need[/i] to play it has diminished I still am interested in getting it on the table fairly regularly.

Players are Mage Knights, roaming the land and having adventures.  Intriguing exploration and adventure game set in a sword and sorcery world from Vlaada Chvatil. Players on their turn play from their hand of five or so cards, moving across an expanding board of hex tiles, and interacting with the spaces they end their turn in.  An amazing adventure game, driven by a deck of 16 cards, which can be used in a myriad of ways to accomplish goals for the turn - moving, fighting, influencing locals, healing, recruiting and so on.  Combat is a dice free card playing exercise that reminds me a lot of the threats you have to deal with in Space Alert. It is impossible to go into detail in the space available here, but wow, we have a rich fantasy space here to explore full of allies, foes, dungeons, monasteries, etc. you can recruit, be a noble savior or a plundering vandal ... it's up to you.  Stuffed full of scenarios and options.... Magic Realm may be finally matched.  Don't expect to quickly inhale a rulebook and leap in... there is a lot to absorb here, but every turn is a delightful puzzle.  Engrossing game.

Very interesting RPG boardgame with more in common with Dominion than it's namesake, Mage Knight. Could seem daunting at first with a fairly bulky manual, but the game at its heart is actually quite simple and could possibly be explained in less than 10 minutes. All the more complex/additional bits can easily be explained as they come up on the new boards (as you explore the map, additional map pieces are added) instead of trying to explain everything right away and confuse the players.
Seems to scale fairly well. 
Interesting and will definitively take it out for a spin again soon.

At the moment I'm  not a believer.

I've played 5 games.  Seems like a game of Magic or these deck building things disguised like a board game.  I think this game has beautiful card combos and the mana dice are very neat, but a hand seems to really force choices.  I don't feel like I can do just anything.  It seems like one turn I can clearly Influence a unit much more than i should fight and the next turn I could become a kick ass fighter and i shouldn't try influencing units at all.  It doesn't make sense to me thematically.  

The story that this game seems to tell me, in my brain, looks like a Disney/Pixar world which isn't a thematic world I want to hang out in.  The characters and events haven't spoken to me yet, I'm hoping my relationship with the world strengthens, but after 5 games all story elements seemed to be overshadowed by procedure.  

While the card combos are fun to make and I like how it seems like a nod to Magic Realm, it just doesn't grab me as a story.  I will keep playing but so far not for me.

I'm not a fan of CCGs and deck builders so that style of play does create a bias in my opinion.  Due to this the game feels like a 3 hour version of a very slow deck building/card combo action style game with the illusion of an adventure game.  My 5th game is when I finally felt I could not lie to myself any longer, this was really a deck building/card combo type game.

Ratings may go up now that I approach this game for what it is.  Maybe I'll appreciate the game play as a deck builder next time.

I've played one game of this so far, the introductory scenario with my step-son, and it was a really good game.  It isn't difficult to play but it is fiddly and there's one hell of a lot of game there and it runs LONG.  Well worth it though if this play was anything to go by.

We never did manage to actually finish the scenario in the time allotted though...  Oh and end game scoring can have a MASSIVE swing effect on the final scores.  I hadn't realised just how important it was; I went from winning by about 5 fame to losing by about 15 fame, which was painful.

There's a lot more that I want to put down here but I've not really got my thoughts in order on the game yet and I should probably play it more before I try.  Suffice to say that I enjoyed it despite the long playtime (we were at it for ~3.5 hours) and the fairly major loss.

Completely lived up to the hype for me. I have only gotten to play it a handful of times so far, mainly because I work a lot, but I had a blast. The game hits all the buttons that I love about games; it looks great, the system is nicely done with a level of skill required to play, there is a lot or replay value, there is character progression and uniqueness to it, and there is a ton of strategy involved. The one down side is the amount of time the game takes to play. This may be improved once everyone gets the hang of the game and can make their moves at a faster pace. I will say that one of my friends does not like; he doesn't get how to play it properly and feels like he is at a disadvantage versus the rest of us because we are more experienced. I think he might have a point, but it also seems like he doesn't pay attention enough to learn proper tactics to be good at the game. All in all I will always be up for a game.

Projected 2 on the Cindometer.  This game is way too long for Cindy with way too much math.  The only reason it is not a 1 is because there is a female Mage Knight.

RATING: 8
Challenging in a fun way. There is a palpable feeling of urgency to rush and find the end-game areas whilst also beefing your character up along the way. Building your deck via your in-game choices is very satisfying and quickly makes the hero your controlling feel like your own creation. The hidden information in the fog of war terrain and encounters makes for suspense and a sense of adventure as you quest for better gear or allies.
 The combat is good but more difficult baddies can take a lot of time to deal with. You may spend 10 minutes puzzling over an encounter, analysing your hand of cards/abilities only to learn that you actually cant kill them after all. So there is a chunk of downtime involved. 1-2 players is great but i'm worried about playing with more - as much as i really want to! The game has so much variety added by the different modes given in the rulebook.
   One of my favourite games but doesn't get higher than an 8 because of the clunkiness of some of the rules and the down-time with more than 1 player which prevents me from always wanting to play.

Traded away for Eclipse on 4-19-13 without ever playing Mage Knight.  The rule books were so ponderous that it just didn't seem worth the effort to learn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
I've only played the introductory game of this, so I may warm to it more when I go back for another try, but my initial thoughts aren't so kind.  I really want to like the game, as it has so many things going for it, but I found it too obtuse.

Being able to explore this world filled with fantastical locations is great.  You have all sorts of options: buying new cards, hiring followers, collecting crystals, sieging castles, sacking monasteries, exploring dungeons, etc.  You can decide to be a renowned hero or reviled villain, and both give you advantages.  The chrome factor is huge, with bits & chits of all kinds.  The day and night phases with different rules are a neat addition.

My first complaint is that combat is really odd and unintuitive.  There are the expected ranged and melee phases.  Instead of just dealing damage and subtracting armor, you have to go through this arcane procedure to block and see how much damage each participant takes.  Then, you can assign some, but not all of it to your followers?  
The rules are so generally massive and fiddly that you'll be referring back to the book for lots of questions.  They do a good job of putting many things on player-aid cards, but it just isn't enough.

The big problem overshadowing all others, though, is the deckbuilding style.  It's a neat idea, but it it doesn't entirely work, esp. not in a game of this length.  Remember when I said you had all those cool options during your turn?  Well, it turns out you actually don't.  Oh, you can gaze at the map and imagine all the stuff you'd like to do, but then you have to look at your hand and discover how little of it you can feasibly attempt.  It's great that you can exchange any card for a 1-point action of any type, but this doesn't really solve the problem.  You can easily be staring at a bunch of move cards when you're sitting next to the fortress you want to attack.  If you move away, you can do something else, but then next turn you'll likely be in the opposite state: with a handful of attack cards and no move to get you adjacent to something to attack.  The game is very tactical this way, asking you to decide what the best thing is that you can accomplish this turn.  Of course, you can save over cards from turn to turn, so you can plan ahead and spend only some of your cards, saving the rest for a more potent turn next time.
All of this would be entirely fine, if not for one more rule.  The day ends when one player exhausts their deck.  This means that instead of having the option to take your time, mitigate bad draws, and advance slowly doing incremental things, you're forced to keep pace with the fastest player.  Someone is going to get all his/her cards in the perfect order, be able to make best use of all of them, and burn through his/her deck like lightning.  If you get your cards in the wrong order or all clumped together, you'll be forced to discard many of them for the generic low-power option, and will fall further and further behind.  If you try to mitigate this by playing cautiously and doing small turns, you'll end the day with half your deck left and be no better off.  Again, this sort of luck-of-the-draw is entirely expected from deckbuilders, but the problem is that those games generally A. play quickly, not as multi-hour affairs and B. see you cycling through your deck many times (hopefully evening out the luck aspect), not just 3.  This even means that adding cool, powerful new cards to your deck isn't that good, since you're still slaved to the pace of the person with the smallest deck and you won't see them more than a couple times max.

We also turned off PvP, and I'm damn glad we did, since continually having to watch your back would make the experience even [i]more[/i] painful.  It seems like turn order would become king, as it'd be really easy to ambush someone who had depleted their cards and couldn't fight back.

Again, I'm going to have to try this a second time, as there was enough there to really intrigue me.  But this stuff really stuck out and hurt my enjoyment of it the first time through.

Although I love that the combat is deterministic, and the way that many of the mechanics work together, I am increasingly impatient with how much of this is random—cards drawn, mana dice, monster tokens drawn, terrain drawn, speed of the dummy player... For someone who enjoys low randomness, this game can be frustrating.

A game like no other, one of the masterpieces by Vlaada Chvátil. You are a powerful Mage Knight on a mission. Explore the land, kick monster's ass, assault mage towers and recruit followers and/or rest in a village. Or plunder that village if you wish! But your popularity will suffer if you do.

To act and fight you gradually build your deck of actions and use the actions you have available in the best possible way.
In this sense, every turn is like a mathematical puzzle, but the theme is very strong and you really feel your power growing. 

Edit: With the coming of Gloomhaven, the deep and Satisfiyng RPG/Fantasy/Adventure feel has been brought to another level, that I think will appeal a wider group of gamer than MK. Nonetheless, this remains a staple for me, it's harder and thinkier, and an unsurpassed work of genius. Plus Gloomhaven spawned from here.

Epic fantasy adventure RPG deck building exploration conquest game and whatnot!
You can go to a mission solo, together with a group or against other players, exploring ancient ruins, monster dens, dungeons, battling orcs and dragons, conquering keeps, towers and even huge cities in an amazing board game world of the Atlantean Empire.
The game is best with two players, although I had some epic experience playing solo. I know it sounds sad, but it was no different than playing Skyrim or Heroes of Might & Magic 3 campaign. With 4 or even 3 players it can drag on too long, which is ok if you are ready to commit to it, but for me, downtime in that case is unacceptable.
I love the way deck building system in Mage Knight offers tons of options and strategy and really rewords the effort.

[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Deckbuilding where each card serves multiple purposes causing major decision making every turn.

RATING: 6
Soured a little after 6 plays. Competitive play means you can do less of what you want, either because you take opportunities from each other, or because you get spells that sabotage each other, or due to open conflict. At any rate it can become a game where you simple do less interesting stuff each turn. It can also miss fire a lot if your map comes out badly. I played a game where no monasteries came out, so little recruiting happened. The randomness of the offer decks and the tiles can determine how fun your game is going to be.

3 solo plays down, a few thoughts; The main appeal of this game is character development. If you like getting new stuff(skills, spells, items, etc) in RPGs and video games this game will be cocaine for your mind. The second major attraction is problem solving with your cards; how can i move 3 spaces, block 5 attack and deal 4 damage with the 5 cards i have in hand, my unit card and my skill tolkens? And how can i do it with maximum efficiency and set up the next turn?

The main draw backs are; its very numbers and mechanical, and so it doesn't have the magic feel of say Wiz-war. Some turns feel like the game plays itself, you look at your hand and the board and there is one optimal solution for the turn.

Whilst these draw backs are issues it stays at a 9 because it does what it does so well. Still need some multiplayer though


------------

initial rating at 9 after just playing the intro scenario.

This game Rocks! It delivers what i want from an adventure game, tactical combat, exploration, character development, strategy, and IMMERSION.

Damn this game is HUGE!
There is so much to learn, after 2 hours of setting up and starting to play with just me and my wife we had made 2 turns each and decided to call it a night. 
but every time I read the rules I find that everything is really well designed and works elegantly, its just that there is so much of it that bogs the game time down. 

We are determined to give it another few goes!

RATING: 6.5
Rating lowered from 8.

I have played this several times now, and each time, my opinion of it lowers just a tad.  Mage Knight is a fantastic game that covers all the grounds of what an adventure game should do - it's engaging, has lots of strategy, a good dash of luck, and is crunchy... in fact, I sometimes feel like it's a little -too- crunchy.  Considering the fact that I love wargames, that's a bit of a bone to chew on.

Overall, every piece of the table-eating game works very well with each other.  From the cards in your hand to the map tiles to the enemy tokens, it all makes sense, but to get to that point can be a daunting task.  Unless you're going to bring this to the table several times in short succession (which is a tall order given the time investment required to do a full conquest game), like most wargames, you need to sit down and re-learn this every time.

Don't get me wrong, I really like MK.  It's a very, very good game (and I'm not really sure why it got a re-theme because it stands on its own - licensing, maybe?), but when I look at the box and think, "Hm, maybe we should play this tonight..." I quickly decide not to.  There's just so much in that box that I don't wanna.

Perhaps it's my desire lately to steer away from epic games, but MK scratches a very specific itch that I don't seem to have anymore.  At least not lately.  It won't ever leave my collection because I'm sure it's one I will come back to (in fact, we always go back to it eventually), but there's something to be said when just getting the game to the table feels like an uphill battle rather than a delightful need to devour the rules and get the ball rolling.

Brilliant.  The only down side is the excessive play time, but that's fine if you know that going in.  There are tons of cards and bits and rules (american style), but the mechanics are clever and tight with low luck, so it plays a bit like an overly complicated euro.  Great game!

Played once.  Never again.  With 3 players and a "short" cooperative game, it lasted 3.5 boring hours.  HUGE amounts of down time, and the mechanisms constantly encourage analysis paralysis.  The game is too fiddly with lots of details, and in the end, the gameplay depends on the order that you draw your deck.  Don't draw move cards? Sorry, you can't move.  But you can discard attack cards to move - but wait, then you won't have attack cards for later. Eventually you've got to level up to fight big monsters - didn't draw all attack/block cards? Take wounds, so you can do even less on your next turn!  The mechanisms encourage a slow, drawn out game, and at the end of the day, it was just BORING.

Great game with awesome design in mechanics. Doesn't get to play as much as I'd like because of the length of the game. It also has the most complicated collection of rules I've ever encountered. There's so much that you need check constantly from the rules. Definitely a game for serious board gamers. Not a casual game in any sense.

EDIT: After some experience the rules are pretty intuitive. Also I can't really imagine how a solo game could be mechanically better than this. So bumped the rating up to 9.

One of the best epic style board games I've ever played. I've played about 5 times with others, and 3 times solo. Each time is a totally different experience. 

The game pieces are high quality except one of my map tiles is peeling slightly. Only dissapointment. The cards are good quality, the heroes are great. Each time we play we increase the difficulty and it adds to the experience. 

The biggest challenge is dealing with monster resistances and trying to move across certain terrains. Nothing feels too overpowered and its nicely balanced. My only complaint would be the playing time can be overwhelming for some. Easily 6 hours for a 3 player game. I would not play with 4 people unless I brought a lunch. 

One of my favorite games I own.

This is a superbly designed adventure/level-up sort of game.  There is a high amount of variability between plays due to: multiple scenarios, randomly generated board, multiple characters to try, multiple variants when you're familar with the game, and many different artifacts/units/actions/spells/monsters.  Sometimes these random factors can lead to a poor situation but that's definitely in the minority.  This also has a very neat day/night cycle which ties into the communal mana system.  This game also features deckbuilding as a way of doing the things you need to do ('attack' enemies, 'block' damage, 'move' around the board, and 'influence' the locals for help).  You'll go through your deck approximately 4 - 6 times in the game which is not that much.  In addition, cards you acquire go to the top of your deck rather than your discard pile similarly to the non-Freebooter Star Player cards in Blood Bowl: Team Manager.  The only reason I don't own it anymore is that It's really long and there are some fiddly rules that are easily forgotten if you don't play it frequently.

This game has the potential to be a monster hit in our gaming guild.  Solo play is quite fun, and I don't play many games solo.  The game has so many options and complexities, yet is pretty simple to pick up.

Looks like a gooder, but plays like a klunker. Irrelevant multiple creature token piles, fussy add on rules, less of a dungeon crawl and more of a secret point grabbing fest, and lastly the deck building aspect hides a uber kulnky action selection system.

RATING: 2.1
Loved the miniatures and hepta-hex tiles.
Like an involved solo game; seek a challenge; do not mind if it takes time.
You play actions allowed by your hand, with a color spice here and there. There are many decks and special cards. Plus bonus tokens that make cards stronger.
You get 'powerfull´ by adding more cards to your hand so that you can perform more actions.
But:
Combat is without tension, because most of the time the outcome can be precisely calculated: this is the worst aspect of the design, boring.
If you have a plan nevermind, just optimize the hand you have and go where the cards dictate. Follow the mainstream and you might win: too much like real life for me.
From my first play attempt: overdone; ultimately pointless; I shall not touch this thing again.
Score: 2 for minis and hex board + 0.1 for gameplay

This game is good, but I'm starting to wonder if it really shines most as a solo game.  It's pretty fiddly, which makes it less enjoyable with more players.

This game is amazing. The only reason this does not get a perfect ten is because the setup and tear down is a beast and the rules take a good while to full wrap your head around, making it very hard to teach other players.

(Rating after one play)

Takes a lot of time to get into. Two dense 20-page rule books, one of which is a lengthy tutorial. The entry hurdle is very steep and you will likely have to spend a few hours to learn the game before you can teach it. If you only play it sporadically, you will have to spend serious time to familiarize yourself with the rules before you can play it. Even if you have the rules down, the game has a ton of options that you have to think about [i]and[/i] it's a huge brain burner because of the way you have to use your cards to accomplish anything.

I can see its appeal for certain groups of players, though.

Should have been right up my alley, but the combination of long play time, analysis paralysis and mathy combat didn't add up (groan) for me. The deck building happens so slowly (unlike most deck builders) that it feels like you're playing with essentially the same hand of cards the whole game.

Best of the best especially solo
MK is like any of your favorite RPG (Final Fantasy, chrono trigger...) brought in as a tense boardgame.
You really feel the increase in power as you level up and gain skills, new (and better) cards and recruit units to fight under your command
The deckbuilding mechanism is put to really good use along with other excellent ideas like mana handling and the fact that cards have 2 distinct abilities (basic or strong if powered up with mana).

However this one is big and heavy on rules (though they're very well explained and the game contains a walkthrough scenario)

Wow. This is awesome... the neat mechanics perfectly integrate with an immersive theme delivering real adventures. Excellent game, so far played 2p coop only. Anyway it is a long game, and would not advise it for more than 3p maybe. The rulebooks seemed initially more than ok but eventually you simply cannot find the stuff you're looking for at the right time: I had more downtimes trying to recall rules than watching my teammate playing :)

Edit: if possible, it plays even better solo. The best fulfilling solitaire experience ever played.

1 play - 7: kinda liked it so far, we'll see i guess.


8 plays - 8: as i learn the game and get to play it more and drudge through rules less, this is getting a lot more fun/a lot less painful.


20 plays - 9: loving it!  Have a few complaints though.  Length, which i'm working on improving with timed variants.  Otherwise i dislike the ungodly number of things to keep track of.  You're bound to miss something every game, and have to rewind, assuming it's even fixable.

The game can also be frustratingly swingy at times - high variance in the cards, tiles, summoners, etc.  Some ambiguous and tedious card interactions reminiscent of Thunderstone are also occasionally annoying.  I don't like when a search doesn't turn up a clear answer.

Remains to be seen if this can get past the magic 30 play mark and beyond, but 20 plays in it's pretty damn good.


42 plays - 8: i don't think this will ever reach 10 for me after all, but it might get back to 9 sometime.  The "body buzz" has died down somewhat.  Still play it a ton, but there's just something missing...

RATING: 10
Mage Knight is my answer to the proverbial question “If you could only keep 1 game…?” not only because of how much I enjoy playing it but for how robust the game is. I enjoy it competitively, cooperatively, and solitaire (if you’re not aware, it’s the highest ranked solo game by the BGG solitaire community). Heck, my friends and I even have an idea to play a 2 v 2 team match and I’m quite sure it’ll work just fine. 

There’s a pretty clear “on-off” point with the game in how you use your cards to puzzle out the optimum move every turn. Either that is gaming crack or you just don’t get it, but if you’re wondering why the game is such a hit with a lot of people, it’s because Vlaada has made the strategic deckbuilder [i]par excellence[/i] in the hobby. 

Admittedly, there’s a steep learning curve and new players may feel like they’re flailing and downtime may seem severe. These are both curable with repeated play. Those that stop at this place miss out on breaking through to the sublimity that lies beneath. My advice is to introduce new players via the cooperative mode and help them play their hands until they get up and running.  

I strongly recommend getting the Lost Legion expansion for the updated cards and tokens alone. The Volkare element is just a bonus variation for coop or solo play.

This is to some extent a "puzzle game", a genre I seem to like less than some people do, but after two plays of the introductory scenario I want to play it more.  It seems clear to me that it's a game that requires a number of plays in order to appreciate what it has to offer, and at this point I'm willing to keep playing it (I have come in dead last in all three games, so it's not the thrill of victory that has me wanting to play it some more!)

I certainly don't believe claims that the winner is primarily determined by luck, even though there is plenty of luck in the game.  There is also a lot you can do to manage the luck.

This may get moved up to a ten when it is all said and done.  The only catch is that since the game can last a while, I don't get it to the table as frequently as I'd like.  Love the deck building, hand management, and exploration aspects of this game.  One of the few games I will play solitaire.

Difficulty and length of the game are appropriate for the amount of set up I have to put into it. So far have only played it co-op or solo, but really enjoy it. The difficulty scales appropriately over the course of the game, often leading to not knowing whether you've won or lost until the last night.

I'm giving this a tentative 9. My few plays have been very compelling and I can't wait to explore the game more and experience some of the different scenarios.

Update: I'm upgrading this to a 10 for now. I've had a few more plays of full conquest and full coop and the game really starts shining when you're building your character out further. I'm a little worried that the same skills are always better options than others but I have a feeling I just haven't fleshed out strategies for them.

An outstanding use of deck- and tableau-building to simulate the growing strength of your player character as you explore and conquer a sprawling fantasy landscape. This seemlessly blends all my favorite aspects of modern game design into one game. Deck-building, tableau-building, multi-purpose cards, exploration, deterministic combat, character development/progression, deep puzzley gameplay, and a rich fantasy theme. The better I understand the rules, the more I love this game.

Yeah, Mage Knight is one of the worst games I've ever played.  I happily traded it away for all the reasons listed below.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

Note:  My "plays" count is misleading - I've attempted this game many more times, and have quit in boredom partway through for most of them.  I only logged the first time I ever played it solo, so I'd remember exactly when I first tried it.

This game feels super fiddly.  I've gotten bored and quit partway through almost every time I've played.  If I am going to spend this much time memorizing this many rules, I'd rather just play D&D, which is at least engaging.

I'm kind of baffled at how highly this is ranked, when opinions seem to be so thoroughly split on it.

I'm even more baffled that people argue that this game is thematic.  It's not.  It's slightly more thematic than Dominion.  The entire game is nothing but an optimization problem.  Use what you know about your hand to do some card counting, and plan out your round accordingly.  The so-called "thematic" mechanics lose their theme the second you use them, because all you do is optimize between the positive and negative numbers for each action.

This game feels more like I'm creating a spreadsheet than playing a game.

It also has one of the worst rule books I've ever seen for a game.  In a lot of games with a lot of complex rules, there are some sort of reference documents - a convenient table, or better yet, a great player board which includes little summaries.  Mage Knight leaves me thumbing through the manual more than playing the game.

I'm convinced that AT LEAST half of the people who praise this game are getting at least one of the rules wrong.  There are so many poorly explained subtleties that I simply find it implausible to believe that the majority aren't missing at least one of them.  I've caught a new one in every game I've attempted - that's usually the part where I say "screw this!" and move on to another game that's actually fun.

Other metaphors for the game play experience: doing my taxes, organizing a stamp collection, and extreme couponing

Another amazing metaphor (from http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2017/02/14/10-reasons-mage-knight-worst-boardgame-time/):  A bucket into which numbers are dumped.

19/07/12 I've wanted to play this game for a while and it did not disapoint. Quite a long game - a basic three player game took us three hours - and it did take that long to get my head around the it.

[u]The Good[/u]: 1) Deep, intelligent. Some games play themselves; this is not one of them. 2) Will continue to challenge you regardless of how good you get at it (and the spread from being a "bad" player until finally becoming [I]good[/I] is vast and long and fraught with many many hours of brain-burning.. hooray-ness).

[u]The Bad[/u]: 1) Limited number of Scenarios (ie: game modes); an incoming Expansion will be adding at least 4 new ones, which may end up fixing this. 2) Doesn't play well with more than 3 players.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: This game is an absolute must-buy if you go into it knowing that it will not deliver if you're looking to make an RPG/Adventure game out of it. Rather it's a puzzle game first, with facets of deckbuilding, all tied to the foundation of a really theme-y map with lots of RPG/Adventure elements sown throughout.

Bit slow and clunky to begin with but it was only our first game so this might improve.

Very slow to add new cards to your decks and the monsters seem to get really hard really quick.
Movement is difficult because it cost so many point that several turns are missed where you move a couple of hexes and then do nothing.

This game is basically a perfect game for me. I played this game for years and still do on a regular basis. Can be an overwhelming experience at first, but with some practice, this simply becomes one of the very best experience you can get. So many opportunities for different types of solo or multiplayer games, I would advise to give this game more than 1 run through, as the more you play, the better it gets!

Learned the intro scenario. I found this game a combination of Magic (get magic, play cards, semi customize your deck), the original Mage Knight (moving around the board to fight monsters of different levels), and Star Treck Fleet Captains (you move to a square and do not know the level of monster you may fight).  I do not like the above three listed games.  I think that Mage Knight Board Game was more fun then the above listed games, but it was still not my favourite.

RATING: 9
After a few plays now, I can honestly say that this is the best game that I've played solo. It is REALLY fun, the only problem being the intricacy of the rules and the fact that I inevitably make a baseline number of errors each play. But it is very satisfying, especially as I have done better the last couple of games. Maybe I'll tire of it. We'll see how it goes. But right now all I can say is that it is full of incident, choice, variety, development. And narrative emerges from the mathematical complexity. Sexy.

I think 3 players might be too many. Also, there might be a runaway leader problem. But on the other hand, the snowballing power of my hero is the satisfying part of the game..

8 word review: Too long. Mathy "adventure" game that's TOO LONG.

Rating history: 4,4

Played 2 times:
2p - intro, 1p intro

July 2014: I went into this playing excited to finally try Mage Knight, but it did nothing for me. The trappings of exploring a fantastic land and engaging in battles gave way to a (finely tuned) Euro that offered me no sense of narrative. Orcs here, orcs there; these ones stats are 4-5-4-poison, these ones are 4-4-3. I dunno - I'd rather be playing a Euro with a theme that seems to fit Euros better (economic management), or a game that feels more like a quest, like LOTR The Card Game. 

I'd say I'd give it another chance, but with such a long playing time, it's hard to get excited about a second playing. It's a deep euro which can be played well (no concerns about mechanical soundness). If it was 90 minutes long, I'd give it a few more plays to explore it. As is, I'll pass.

It's not a terrible game, but it's not my sort of game.

JUN/17: Traded Troyes to receive this.

RATING: 8.2
Despite that this game takes hours to play, it gets a high rating.  It ended long before I was ready for it to end.

Despite the fact the rule book is daunting, it gets a high rating.  And the tutorial for a beginner's game is great.  

The massive card text does annoy me.

Complaints: The Location Cards should be printed on only one side, not double sided.  I think there should be two sets.  On the back of the rule book there is a review of the monster/enemy symbols, but there should also be a player's aid for the rest of the icons.

I like: The modular board sets up differently each time for variety. Graphics are good, and the 4 player tokens are fantastic.  This brings us to the real meat of the game, the excellent play.  Interestingly, there are solo and co-op variants. 

This is a softly spoken deck building game, so even those who proclaim they don't like the genre, might overlook the building aspect and very much enjoy it. 

I must say I am certainly impressed with Vlaada Chvátil.  I have yet to be disappointed with one of his games.  

3rd game played was in co-op with 2 others. The play is much different.  An enthusiast of the game said the expansion Lost Legions is a must for co-op play.

Card driven puzzle adventure game about character growth and conquest

Pro
-Extremely tight and well designed game with very rewarding/narrow combat elements
-Deeply brain burning, but great for people that enjoy puzzles and optimizing their resources (cards in hand)
-Has a good sense of exploration, character growth and also liked that you could perform good deeds or evil deeds in game (e.g. burning down a monastery)
-Can be played competitively or cooperatively with different scenarios
-Streamlined the book keeping in some ways - next player can fully take their turn while the previous player does all their level up/loot collecting etc.
-One of the best solo games I've played

Cons
-Long game length (3+ hours) is not for everyone
-Steep learning curve
-Somewhat anti-climatic end game fights
-Long game rounds for players prone to AP (especially in "boss" fights)
-When playing with others, you will feel rushed to act and may not be able to look through all the options (often quite a few) available to you
-Miniatures and some component qualities (aside from cards) are average

My god this game is long, and has a tonne of convoluted rules! However unlike Arkham Horror, the chrome is pretty coherent and affect the gameplay. There are a lot of important decisions, and despite the die rolls, tile flips, card draws and chit pulls, you have considerable control over what happens.

Over 3 games (and a peek at at PBF game) I became a much, much better player. However the rules are insanely fiddly, causing me to spend a lot of time on bookkeeping and rules-lookup (even though I push through the smaller gaps), breaking immersion. I really wish they were simplified, made more consistent, or better cued graphically.

For example, elemental resistance works differently between your units and enemies; there are 3 different types of monster dungeons (in addition to settlements, fortifications, and roving enemies)

That said, there's huge variety with all the different types of monsters, units, spells, actions, and so on, which provide a level of "emergent narrative" and bricolage gameplay. It is perhaps the exploration adventure game that I've been looking for, but covered in so much mechanical bookkeeping that I'm finding it hard to recognise.

It takes forever solo; I can't imagine playing with 4p, and teaching is sure to be crazy. The interaction appears to be almost entirely of the annoying, negative, swingy kind, making me think that it's not worth the effort.

I'm not sure how much variety the setup (as opposed to the card and skill draws) provides.

Supposedly Magic Realm is still superior...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It is a very good solo game, perhaps the first true solo game i have ever played. Even if it is a really complicated game (rulewise), it is pretty easy to get into it : after 2 plays, you are in. I have followed the general advice to read the playbook and to watch Ricky Royal's videos and this help a lot.

The brillance of this game is in the cards : each turn, you will have to adapt to your hand (you have 5 cards in hand at the beginning of the game) and resolve the puzzle. There is room for strategy though :

1) unlike Dominion, you can keep cards from turn to turn (at the end of your turn, you can discard cards and you replenish your hand to your hand limit) : this is why it is possible to plan for the next turn

2) you can always play any card (except wound card) as a 1 point of the action you take

3) cards earned when leveling up is put on top of your deck, hence ready for the next turn

4) mana allow you to strengthen the card effect and as a result, helps you to better manage your hand.

The combat system is really interesting : the enemies always attack first except when you are able to launch a siege or range attack. This prevent the game to become a shoot-them-up-all because you will have to block the attack in order not to be wounded (wound cards go in your hand directly and slow your deck rotation down). Only after the enemies have attacked you and you had a chance to block, you are allowed to attack them.

So each attack must be careful planned : it is certainly well advise to wait the next turn to attack an enemy if you have not enough attack points in your hand this turn. Or perhaps you choose to take the risk (certain enemies are not revealed before the combat) and deal with the wounds because you can get rid of it (you have cards and/or units with curative effects, you are in a village or a monastery). But it is up to you to decide at the end.

The different places, enemies, advanced actions, units, spells, artifacts, scenarios (solo, cooperative, competitive) provided bring a lot of gaming and diversity out of the box.

I must say that the french translation is awesome, consistent, really well written, in very good french. This has to be point out given the complexity and quantity of rules in this game (2 books of 20 pages each).

An epic and challenging strategic adventure game with a high entry cost. The most compelling aspect is how every turn is a complex resource optimization puzzle. It is very rewarding to be able to pull off a killer combo but, at the same time, the very nature of the game can easily lead to frustration when you draw the wrong card at the wrong moment, discover (after doing your math) that you are one point flat from taking out an enemy, or when you suddenly lose the one mana you needed not to waste your entire turn. The clock is always ticking and it is unforgiving.

While Mage Knight can provide an epic sense of adventure, with an immersive theme and varied and interesting enemies/encounters, learning to play the game is hard. If you don’t play often you will find yourself referencing the manuals constantly. Downtime can be brutal, and even playing solo can span multiple nights per game due to how much you can end up reconsidering your next move. Also the cooperative variant is barely so. Not recommended for more than two, and good luck anyway trying to convince a newcomer to take the time to learn it.

So, if you think you have the time and patience to commit to learning this game and step up to the often-frustrating challenge, there is much to love in Mage Knight.

RATING: 6
Extremely complicated and requires a ton of set up. Would honestly be better served as a co-op/competitive RPG for iPad and/or PC. Combat is also too deterministic (as in: completely deterministic apart from a few situations where you'll face a random monster from the pile). So most of the time you can calculate exactly which fights you will and won't win, which saps a lot of drama from the game. 

The rule book is badly done, which is rather unfortunate for a game like this. At the most fundamental level, required information should not be split across what are obstensibly the "new player's starting guide" and the "comprehensive reference." Somehow there is quite a lot of information in the "new player's" book that is missing from the "comprehensive" book- including information about the same topic, e.g. combat. You will be paging back and forth between them for quite a while. More rules are hidden on various location/monster/doodad cards so you will be paging through those as well. 

Apart from that, it's a reasonably well-implemented game. Unlike games like Arkham Horror, Mage Knight actually has some interesting gameplay under the pile of excessive bookkeeping. There is a massively overcomplicated system of leveling up that still manages to be fun. 

Don't try this without 1+ other people willing to slog through a 3-4 hour marathon, though.

This game is very fun, but is, by far, the most complicated game I've ever played.  The grand scheme of the game is easy to pickup, but there's A LOT of minutia in the rules.  The reference cards help with remembering all the little details though.  Just go slow at first and give yourself time to get good at the game.  The sense of power you earn as you tear through the countryside is very rewarding.  

Tip: the game will get 100% better the moment you realize taking wounds isn't the end of the world.  Kill things, get bigger, heal, repeat.

Bonus Tip: Consider buying a custom insert for the game.  You'd be surprised how much quicker you'll be able to setup and tear down the game.

Wow. It takes a while to learn Mage Knight, but once you do you are in for a fantasy treat. Rampaging across the countryside and mowing down orcs and dragons? Check. Showing up in a village to recruit its ablest young men as battle fodder with a solemn heroic promise and then turning right around and pillaging the place to add a power or two to your next turn? Check. Taking a small detour to lay siege to a mage tower and pilfer a powerful spell to make your grim march toward your objective a little easier? Check. And you have to do all that and more, because when you finally get to those cities you are fated to conquer at all costs, it'll take every last drop of blood and magic you can muster to topple its defenders. This game manages to scratch just about every epic fantasy itch you might need a board game to scratch. It does solo, co-op, and competitive, whatever you want. The potential turnoffs are that it does take hours to play on top of the steep learning curve. It's the most absorbing solo game I have, though, and I love burning through a few hours to try to conquer the land.

Mage Knight is first and foremost a solo puzzle game. In a way that is not too dissimilar from e.g. Dungeon Lords where the apparent core game (there Worker Placement, here Deck Building) merely serves as trappings for solving the challenge presented to you on the board. Mage Knight is probably a little more successful in hiding this simply because of the wealth of trappings thrown in the way of the players.

That said, all those trappings come for a price. Even though most of the rules are fairly intuitive there are many of them, and that results in a steep learning curve at the beginning. This is clearly a game that rewards repeated plays and benefits a lot from not having to learn the rules from the rulebook. The wealth of options provided by those rules on one hand creates lots of interesting choices and opportunities for clever play, but on the other also provides lots of room for mental breakdowns and excessive downtimes, so it's no wonder the game is usually considered better with fewer players. Since it's mostly solo play anyway, that doesn't seem like too much of a disadvantage, though.

What kind of impresses me most about Mage Knight is how the designer succeeded to make this mostly mechanical puzzle still feel like a very thematic fantasy romp. It obviously has a lot of appeal for both gamer factions but I'm still not quite sure how he managed to pull that off.

RATING: 10
Easily my favorite game. Only con to this game is hard to get others to play because of the long games. I love long games though so it doesn't bother me. Tons of replay value, even for solo play, and requires a lot of strategy to accomplish scenarios. Mage Knight isn't as tough to learn as people say it is in my opinion, it just takes a few play through's and you'll get it.
I have the Lost Legion expansion and highly recommend getting it, it adds more uniqueness to the mage knights and fixes some mistakes made in the original print.
I highly recommend if you like games that require thinking and strategy and don't mind 2-3 hour games. I'd stay away if you only enjoy short party games with little depth.

One last thing to add is the replay value of this game is almost infinite. I have over 15 plays and each time was faced with different world to explore with different challenges. Also, I highly recommend getting card sleeves, a plastic token box(6$ at Walmart), and printing out some of the optional card boxes and map cards found in the forums for this game here on boardgamegeek. They increase the longevity of this game and make set up and putting away much smoother and faster.

Keep on hunting fellow Mage Knights!

The best RPG boardgame out there. When you level up and get new skills and advanced actions you feel more powerful (unlike other RPG boardgames where I've seen "hi-level" heroes being trashed by low-level monsters). All the mechanic fit well and this game feels very thematic to me, so I don't understand why other people are calling it "unthematic" and "a soulless euro". I can see the luck having an impact on players turns, but I have found it managable in all the games I played so far. Never have I felt screwed over by luck. The only problem I have with Mage Knight is the lack of quests - i.e. some way of acquiring quests from the village and fulfilling them getting fame and reputation to make the game more diverse. 

Edit: After over 30 plays of the game I can see why people get frustrated while playing this. There IS a lot of luck involved (the tiles, the monsters) which can screw you over. But since I'm playing it strictly co-operatively now, I don't mind the luck as much. It remains as one of the most thematic games I've played.

A wonderful game - not nearly as complex or brain burning or full of exceptions s some people want to make you believe.
It can be long, but there are short scenarios as well (there is one in shades of tezla where you start at a higher level which lasts only 1 day and 1 night; this should only last for about an hour!).

Regarding "rules exceptions"that some people claim: I consider those to be s imply rules, and not receptions. Example: There are quite a few icons on the enemy counters that represent their abilities. Yes, each icon comes with its own rules, but these are there for reasons: 1. For thematic reasons (like the fortified spice worm stolen from dune:) - 2. For gameplay reasons, since all those rules add to the variety and complexity of the puzzles the game presents to you.

Mage Knight reminds me of elements I enjoyed from a high school algebra class or working in excel. I would describe this game as thematic algebra, which is strongly appealing to me. It is a mathematic puzzle of how to efficiently use the cards in your hand (and troops you buy, skills you acquire, reputation you earn, magic enhancement (via dice, stored crystals, and short term gains)) against your location on the board. There are often three or four ways to earn fame (VP) at your location by applying a dozen different variables that reset each turn. All of them can be viable, but one of them tends to be best. The genius of the game is that the math you apply to solve the puzzles feels thematic and relevant to what you are doing.

Mage Knight is, essentially, a highly replayable set of algebraic storybook problems themed as a very slick RPG game. the mechanics remind me of a deeper puzzle solving version of Troyes, but with a theme near and dear to my heart. The design is genius, but if spending hours playing around with IF statements in excel is not fun for you, don't ever play this game.

IF(3*B3+C4/2>A3,"KILL THE DRAGON","DRAGON KILLS YOU")

For the price of this game, there are some disappointing component issues. The tiles warped notably during our initial play and the printing at the edges was loose. The warping supposedly resolves over time, but the loose printing is terrible.

Some cards showed wear/minor damage IN THE SHRINK. I threw them in clear Dragon shields and am less concerned about the card issues.

NOTE: I would not recommend this at four player.

First of all this may have the worst rulebook I've had to read. Second of all this is very hard to find players for... So far I haven't.

It is a good solo experience but it gets drawn out and tedious with more players and since I like to play with others more than alone this just isn't as good for me as I want it to be.

But let me tell you the gameplay is spectacularly deep once you get it down.

This is a game of non-decisions based upon random hands of cards dealt from decks far too similar to one another. Though one can perfectly well keep track of what cards are left in his deck due to its small size, that won't help anything if you have a wonderful combat hand but no way to walk to where any combat is possible. You might draw a lot of movement for your first hand and then you have no idea where you'll need to be to use your next cards. You can hold on to cards to design your hand, but then you've effectively crippled yourself with a smaller hand-size. Unfortunately, building your deck to differentiate yourself from other players is so slow as to be hardly worth mentioning. The way the powerful part of cards is locked behind mana barriers is the only interesting design decision here.
Combat is dull because there's so little surprise to it. You'll never put yourself in a combat scenario without a hand of cards that can handle combat.

When I saw this at BGGCON 2011, it was on my list to try but was never able to play it due to the vender's availability; gone to lunch, got the crud, and then went home.

I finally played my first game this weekend.  However, after stumbling through our first play, with two others in the same boat, I love it and will probably rate it higher once we become a bit more experienced...

Don't expect to learn how to play this game in one night.  There are a lot of rules to digest and comprehend.  However, reviewing a few videos here on BGG plus going through the “walkthrough” by playing the Reconnaissance scenario helped ease into the game.

RATING: 7
Finally got to play Mage Knight - a game that has actually become a sort of joke to end a night of board gaming, "So... anyone for a game of Mage Knight?"  It was intimidating to be sure, but I managed to borrow by brother-in-law's copy and read the rules and played a couple of solo turns to get a feel.  Played a 2-player game with Brendon tonight to see how it actually shakes out.

There is a lot of interesting stuff going on in Mage Knight.  The card play is the meat of the game and is actually quite puzzly and feels very open.  Play your cards one way and you get an entirely different turn than if you play them the other way. Even playing them in a different order can garner very different results. So there's a lot of humming and hawing about how exactly to play your turn out.  This can lead to an almost silly amount of downtime and resetting your turn multiple times. But I think that's mainly a product of the uninitiated.  I can see familiarity with this game ironing out those issues, though I would never want to play this with 4 players, even if they all had a couple of games under their belts.  Even though I think the card system makes for many choices, you are still frustratingly cut out of what you want to do at times, as the cards may simply not be there.  And you may be in positions to really kick ass (and there's rarely if ever any hidden information on monsters) and you just go in and do that. No surprises.  In the end, I think Mage Knight is fascinating in many respects and is one of the heaviest modern adventuring fantasy games I've played.  I do think it does suffer at times with turns just not feeling "fun".  It's so mechanically heavy that its theme at times gets lost in all the heavy.  Yes, you will suffer, and feel let down, and you can definitely "rest" and hope the right cards come your way, or come up with a different plan with the cards you have.  But the struggle is so deep that it takes a razor's edge to the thrill these types of games generally get out of me.  It is certainly one of the most crunchiest types of these games I've ever played.  So there.  I like Mage Knight.  I respect Mage Knight. I would play Mage Knight again.  But I had a hard time believing in the world of Mage Knight, if that makes any sense.

Fun - I haven't tried the solitaire scenario yet, which may bump the game up to an 8. Has a great flavor and feeling to it, the mage knights do feel like strong heroes rampaging through the countryside.
Main downside is the length, especially with many players. Additionally there is a pretty high random component, with card drawing, dice rolling, and monster generation all potentially creating large swings. This is compounded by minimal rubber banding mechanics, so that one or two early lucky breaks can pretty much decide a game.
At the end of the day, a blast to play - if you have a day.

I hated this game the first time I played it... I disliked my second play of it... and on my third attempt... CLICK! Whoa! What is this game!? To make a long story short it became my favorite game and remained there for a long while. It's an euro disguised in AT/RPG clothes. Your brain will melt, for real. Just find someone to teach you the game as the rule book is a monster. 

The character progression (deck building) is so gratifying. I mean when you start the game you can barely defeat a simple enemy and by the end of the game you have such powers that you can kill a dragon with your hand of cards and clever play. 

Each game tells a story. You can recruit soldiers, golems, build catapults. You can be a hero loved by all of you can be a nasty villain that steals and burns monasteries to the ground. The artifacts and spells you can collect are so cool. But to achieve great things you must be smart and use your cards and resources wisely. There is no dice rolling here. You must prepare and evaluate and do the best you can with the hand you are dealt.   

This is Vlaada's masterpiece.

A rollicking boardgame RPG that actually feels heroic.  It feels like you're exploring and improving.  You can be a good guy, a bad guy, a mage, a reaver and more.  Best part: all this is done via the deckbuilding mechanic.  The art's great, the castles and characters are cute and the overall production value is high.  A little hard to learn the first time out due to the large number of strategies and alternatives, but well worth the investment.  Might not play with 3-4 players due to concerns about extended play time.

I like it, its a good game. However, the last rounds of the longer scenarios can be excrutiatingly like solving complicated math problems. Never play this late at night or if anyone has a headache! 

I think I prefer the shorter scenarios so far since the amount of variables to calculate only increases as the game goes on.

This is now the only boardgame (other than Arkham Horror) I ever played solo.  Holy cow it's complicated!  It's quite a feat mastering all the rules and exceptions enough to be comfortable playing the game.  When I slipped into the groove though, WOW what a game!  Each turn is an optimization puzzle that leads to powering up your fantasy hero - and the power curve is tremendously satisfying.

That said - I've only tried playing with someone else once, and it's the first time I've ever seen someone rage at learning a BG :o  Also the lady is too intimidated to give it a shot.

AP is probably a killer with the wrong group, so care must be taken when choosing friends to play with.

+++++ was 9.25

Played maybe 10 times since the last comment, mostly 2 and 3 player games (and one 4 player game which took forever); the game gets better and better though again there are so many rules it is tough to keep them all straight.  Consistently fun, interesting, and challenging.

+++++ was 9.5

Played a handful of PvP games and what can I say - the game is even better.  Only thing that can ruin the game are really slow players or if someone is playing to just troll you, but that is true in any significantly long game.

Would love it if someone came up with a more accessible rule book though; it is way too hard to find rules and info in any timely manner.

Last night I ended the game by making a dragon kill another dragon (that I first froze in ice), after killing two others at range - and so we beat Volkare on his first city assault with time to spare.  What a cool game.

Fantasy strategy game with elements of Runewars (order cards and modular map tiles), World of Warcraft TBG (combat), Magic the Gathering (mana) and Magic Realm (day/night turns).  A race to collect victory points but otherwise not strongly competitive (unless using the PvP rules).  Interesting reputation mechanic means you can somewhat play as good or evil.  The game suffers from downtime with multiple players so really plays best as a solo experience.  I may rate this game higher after more plays but for now it doesn't feel distinct enough from my other games to warrant purchase.

My preference is for games which have simple, elegant gameplay mechanisms which lead to difficult decisions.  This isn't like that: there's a lot of incidental complexity in the form of modifiers, rules exceptions, etc.  So as expected, this isn't really my thing.

Having said that, it's an extremely well-produced game with an excellent rule book and some neat deck-building mechanisms.

I've only played 1 game of this so far and it was the intro. Though I'm really liking what I'm seeing here and what I've read in the rules book. There's a lot to learn here and will take a few plays to get the hang of the game, but once you do it seems like it'll be an awesome dungeon romp of a game.

RATING: 7
Very long game time, and prone to slight AP when the cards don't seem to be quite enough to accomplish what you would like, but this game is figgin fun, and the rules really flow quite easily as long as you have someone experienced to teach them to you.

UPDATE - I bought my friend's copy, and have been playing this a bunch solo. It is by far my favorite solo game at this point. I can get through a full game in 2.5-3 hours, and I am still playing fairly slowly. I expect I'll be completing the full solo conquest scenario in 2 hours soon.

The game rewards tactical thinking, and winning a big battle is really a triumphant feeling. I feel like my character develops differently, and has new and fun powers every game.

But it's not only good for solo gaming. I taught my wife the game and played through the intro scenario. She won, and she had a blast. Including teaching, the whole game took maybe 2 and a half hours. I think she would be willing to play a coop blitz scenario soon (but probably not competitive).

Update - Had trouble getting it to the table. Set-up took a while. Traded.

This game has to be one of my favorite infusions of many games I love.  The adventure of games like D&D and DungeonQuest, the deck building of games like Thunderstone, and the mana usage and card management of Magic.  I find myself unable to stop playing turns in this game as I want to see what happens next along with the reflection of accomplishments made.  Excellent design, mechanics, and replay value.  Can't say enough here - great game!

SO AMAZING.  I really love this game.  It's complex and has interesting choices, and levels up smoothly, and is hard but not un-winnable, and plays much like a video game.  The components are beautiful. The variety of game options is excellent. It wasn't even terrible to learn, and I was bracing myself for a challenging orientation. The "Walk-Through" is a fantastic tool - it was very well done. It took a few hours, but it wasn't confusing, and step by step it laid out whole game. By the time I finished my walk through game, and one more game, I pretty much knew the game, and found that I had very few questions I still had to look up.  I'm really impressed with how well designed this game is!  I like it a lot solo, but with the right partner, it would be fun to play with someone else too.

RATING: 7
A worthy successor to Magic Realm, absolutely brilliant solitaire, varied and most importantly its alive and being supported.  I hope there will be expansions for this game.
Components are amazing and the art work great.  Each turn is full of decisions and narrative.  BEST GAME OF 2011.

Any gripes?  Just one which prevents it from garnering a 10... I think it could be a little harder solitaire.  Nothing a tough expansion or two won't fix.

Down graded 1 point to 8.5, its just too easy to win solitaire, lost much replayability because of it.

Whoa, this was a chore to learn...and then you play it, and it doesn't seem so bad. Just, fiddly. This is an adventure puzzler. A more mechanical/predictable version of Runebound. That said, for the effort it takes to learn this you must REALLY decide what kind of adventure game you're looking for. Do you want a story, or just to imagine exploring forests or dungeons? With much less effort I get that feeling from Runebound, or the Dungeons and Dragons Adventure games. They are nowhere near as rules fiddly as this. However, this game, while lacking in a progressive story, has much deeper decisions involved in every action. Planning movement, how to use your hand of cards optimally, do I risk checking out those ruins or not? It's a pretty cool game, but you have to be in a special mood to bother with learning it and setting it up. I need to try it with the expansions to see what that adds. Also, I probably would only play this solo, or 2 players MAX. It would take forever otherwise.

A more thematic adventure/rpg game with a deck building mechanism at its heart. Quite fun, but not sure I really enjoy the process of drawing cards, figuring out how to make the most optimal play using those cards, then executing it. Rinse repeat. At any rate, it was fun for the intro game.

Phenomenal. Just phenomenal. Over the years I've acquired Dungeon!, Descent, Return of the Heroes, Talisman...all in a quest to get my quest on. Each of them had pieces that were great, all of them fell short. Then I found Mage Knight, and I am content.

It's got it all. Epic exploration, leveling up and acquiring new skills, even the way visibility changes from day to night is a great touch. It seems so daunting with all the little bits hoarded together on the table, but everything works, everything fits together.

If components were a little better (cards and boards warped and tokens are peeling a little) and the instruction book was more clear (if it weren't for BGG and Vlaada and Paul's posts I would have no idea how to play) this would be a 10.  Perfect blend of deck building, resource management, and ameritrash.  Only other draw back is setup and play time.

This game is enjoyable.  There are a lot of nice elements to it and I enjoy the theme.  I can't say that there is anything particularly novel about Mage Knight, however, and the instructions are absolutely horrendous.  If you are going to have a "walkthrough" it should actually be a walkthrough, and the rules should be comprehensive.  What they've developed is a terrible system where you are searching through both books to find rules.  I definitely recommend picking up a copy if you are interested in a more complex version of Runebound or Talisman.

Others have said much better than I can why this game is pure awesomeness.

Playing cooperative games only, this game is particular because the interaction is quite limited: players need to coordinate at the end of the game for the final assault, but other than that, everyone is pretty much on their own. It's interesting for people that don't want competitive gameplay but still want to make decisions and develop their own strategy without too much impact on the group.

The game also excels at creating a new challenge each game. Unlike many other coop games, even when you know the game very well, it's still a challenge and a brain-intensive process to win (difficulty is also very customizable).

The game is good. It really is. BUT, it turned out to be something that I wasn't expecting it to be. This game feels much more like a heavy puzzle than anything else. Each turn you are burning your brain to find the optimal play with the cards you have, and for some people that's perfectly fine, but when your group consists of 4 players (or more), the game doesn't feel right. There's an immense downtime between turns if you are playing with 3 or 4 and that's a game killer for me. You can play your turn in infinite ways and you probably won't find the "solution" for it even with that immense downtime (unless you are a really skilled player, but to reach that level you have to play A LOT). This is the perfect game for solo players, which isn't my case.

This was a great disappointment for me. As a fan of heavy games and deckbuilding I was ecstatic to give this a shot. I usually love everything Vlaada releases, but for me he was too ambitious on this game. I like a lot of things about this game, but the bad out-weight the good. THE GOOD: The mechanics are tight, and you get the constant pressure of needing to do more in your turn. The game is a sandbox experience, but still keeps a known end in sight at all times. Components are good. THE BAD: The rulebook. One of the worst designer games rulebooks I've read in a while. I love playing heavy games, and I don't mind a rulebook that's 40+ pages long. I do not like a game that has a cluster of various mechanics and exceptions and not having the ruling for them handy. The amount of options and little rules hidden in this book creates slow pace games, and long turns, and gives the sensation that it this games is in desperate need of streamlining. This is one of those games that requires a lot of plays to get the hang of it, and multiple reading of its rulebooks. I love when a game has so much to offer and it takes dozens of plays to explore it all, I don't love when the effort to get to the point to appreciate this game is more than you get out of it. I would only recommend this game to people with very small collections or solo gamers that have the time to dedicate the amount needed to properly enjoy this game.

can be a longer game, but is a great RPG style game to sit down and spend a few hours playing. Start with a weak but capable hero, and as time continues you are able to learn new spells, gain new items and such.
Interesting mechanic of your health being tied to your hand of cards, so that every time you play or use a card your health gets lower
While PVP combat is in the game, I have never seen it occur as the benefits of attacking another player are so small, and require a great deal of your health and resources. Much more valuable to go attack something on the board or storm a castle rather than attack other players

RATING: 10
My current favorite board game, and probably the most brilliant game design I've ever seen. MKBG is an extremely multifaceted game that offers a rich playing experience. It rates high on both randomness and skill, which is a combination I look for in games. The core of MKBG is a deck-building card game, and everything else is arranged around that core. 

Most deck-builders focus more on choosing the cards you'd like to draw later, and less on figuring out the best way to actually play your hand. MKBG is not like that. The tactics of card play are extremely complex, challenging, and flexible. Every card can be used in at least six ways, two primary and four secondary. There is the card's standard effect, an advanced effect that requires you to spend mana, and four generic wild-card effects that are shared by all cards. And even once you've chosen which cards to play for which effects, there are further decisions about how to apply those effects. Where do you move? What battles will you fight? How will you assign your blocking, wounds, attacks, etc.? How will you get the mana you need? Which cards should you conserve for next round? Are you willing to blow a bunch of these cards for weaker wild-card effects just to get to the cards you need? Or should you just rest and do some discarding so that your hand is stronger next turn?

Also, there is much more to MKBG than just the card play. There is an entire map to explore. Where you travel and where you are positioned are extremely important, because they determine your current and future opportunities. Each location has different challenges, different benefits. There are units to recruit into your army. The units don't go into your deck. They stay on the table, and can provide a variety of services at crucial moments. There is a constantly-changing shared mana pool, with dice showing different colors of mana. There are mana crystals, which allow you to store mana of a specific color until you need it. There are Tactics cards that you draft, which also don't go into your deck. Those determine turn order and usually give you a special power for the round. As you gain fame, you will benefit from special skill tiles, increased resistance to wounds, a larger hand size, and the ability to command more units. There is also your reputation to consider, which affects the way you interact with many of the board locations.

The cards you draw will often prevent you from doing what you would like to do in the way you would like to do it. But with experience, you learn that there's always a way to work around this. There is a great deal of power in planning ahead in MKBG. Novice players probably will approach the game one turn at a time, and may not see the more strategic elements. But the best players are always thinking about their next turn, and the turn after that, and the rest of the round, and the rest of the game. You want to have a plan for what you're doing over the next several hands, but you need to stay flexible and willing to re-order things or develop contingency plans.

Yeah, overrated.  Does have a nice Magic Realm feel and atmosphere. Not deck-building, more deck management (as my friend called it).

Downsides:

1) Long
2) Rules written like total s*** (and I don't mind AH rules)
3) Euroy point reward system for being best in numerous categories.  Means you have to diversify your targets.

Maybe countless expansions (like all modern popular games) will help.  Try as I might, I just don't like it.  Scared to gamble on expansions.

This is the probably the best fantasy adventure game to this date. What sets it apart from many other in the genre is that this has a lot of strategy and tactics involved. This is much more complex than other games of this irk, but once you play it seems to work quite smoothly. The game seems to work well with any number of players, even the solo game, but is at its best with two or three players because of the downtime and that there is not a lot of interaction with the other players. 

While the main thing of the game isn’t deck building, it sure is an important part of it. The heroes should make a stand on how they should develop their characters and there are constantly interesting decisions. While the game has a lot of luck most things can be managed. If you are bold you can develop your character really fast.

This is a wonderful game, and pretty simple when you look at it, but despite that it's really hard to play correctly - we're always forgetting some rule of another - I guess we get carried away in the moment.

I love the "puzzle factor" of trying to work out the best way to overcome an obstacle, or if it's even possible, and the moment when it "clicks" and you cry "Eureka" is just so joyful.

I'm not sure this is a game to be played with 4 (5 with with expansion? ) as it will take such a long time (we managed 5/6 rounds in 7 1/2 hours last night). Even with experienced players there are still going to be moments where someone is going to need to work through a difficult situation. Still love the game tho'.

Awesome solo game. Very thematic, feels like an adventure. A deck-building and card-combo puzzle. I have most expansions. My favorite solo game by far.

When I first got this game I found the rules hard to grasp. I persevered and watched the excellent Ricky Royal YouTube video series and the rules quickly became very intuitive.

Well done adventure game with upleveling and light deck building and planable fights. A bit long for what it is or with other words don't play with A/P prone players. The game is [i]not[/i] that complicated that one needs 15 mins to take his turn... Moving costs seem a bit high, so with a bad luck of draw (the game is card driven) you cannot move for some turns. But overall it's a clever desgin: many adventure games are like this:  "move, discover, roll some dice for combat, do the bookkeeping", repeat. Mage Knight is different: you have to manage your resources very well: "move / attack / block / influence" all this is very well interwoven with manacost management.
After my second play with 4 players, I had to downrate it from 7, but why? All players were already experienced. Not counting setup in, we played (rounded down) 4 hours for the 4 Cities scenario.
4 hours for a 4 player game. Now do the math yourself: how long did I play and how long did I wait? Yes during 4 hours I played one hour the rest I waited to do my fellow players their turns.
I consider downtime a major fun killer. It seems that the author didn't want to relinquish one of his ideas for this game resulting in a very slow pace with too much downtime. The math you have to do later in the game when sieging Cities is too much.

RATING: 5
Tentative rating after one play. 

I believe that the downtime of this game is significant and quite frustrating after a while. I also believe that that may be because we had to check a lot of rules now and again. 

This looks like a computer game in boardgame form. It has some deck-building mechanics and there is little you can do each turn. If you get all the movement cards or the attack cards together, which can sometimes occur, you're screwed. The problem is that the discarding is penalizing in this game, so the types of cards you get are going to make a big difference. You just cannot spend cards the "any cards" just to have 1 move, 1 attack or 1 influence, because that is going to impact a lot on your overall game. 

This starts as a quite simple game, and becomes very difficult as it goes on. I would compare it to Le Havre: you have so many things that you need to do, and only little that you can actually do. The other players' actions are very relevant since they can make and brake the game for you. 

DO NOT play with known AP people. 

UPDATE
I played again. The first impressions stand. 

This game is insufferably long. With just 2 players the game went 4 hours and a half long.

A monster. I set it up for a solo game with the best intentions. This takes a long time. Much later, I draw my starting hand of cards, look out at the board, and instantly I become depressed. This is because I will only ever play this game solo. It is the best way to play, and it screams to a halt with the addition of even a second player. It sounds weird to say, but this would be rated a five if it weren't so fastidiously designed.

Veeery slow and brain-burning yet so fun and satisfying. A masterpiece in terms of design of mechanics.
Everything is there (deck building, moving on the board, leveling up, casting spells, beating monsters, reputation, multiple scenarios and so on) and it's working so perfectly together!
Deserves 10 score with no second thought. Though, same as with Through the Ages - cannot imagine us playing with more than 2 players.

What an ambitious game! I must warn you it's very challenging to learn, and so rewarding when you get it. As you're reading the manual, don't mistake content for complexity. You don't have to learn every single thing before you start playing.

Excellent hand management mechanics that make you feel powerful, and it generates a very engrossing puzzle that's also the best solo gaming experience I've had so far.

There can be a lot of downtime, so I found it best with one or two players.

I really like this game but it takes forever. In the time it takes my group to play and clean up this game we could play so many other good games.

I want to like this and have tried it several times. As of this writing, I am done with this game.

Many of my issues have already been aired and debated in the forums, however, they are still valid for me.

Simply some of the worst rule books ever written in English. Far more complex games have been well explained in half the words of this game. YAY WIZKIDS!

For the love of GOD...please hire a technical writer to help guide your trained monkeys you call a writing staff! How many games will you allow them to butcher before you fix the issue?

Piss poor components, at least the ones that matter...you know...the cards and tiles...THEY SUCK! However, they did manage to over produce every other trinket they stuck in the box to justify a 90 dollar sticker price. YAY WIZKIDS!

I can respect the game design, however, I have no interest in playing it. A game that moves as slowly as this really needs to pull me into it.

Again, I respect it. However, I hate it.

Not actually as complicated as some people seem to think.  The main problem is the difficulty, it takes a number of plays before you really get to grips with how to build and use your deck effectively, and by then you may have given up.  I think it actually works better as a single player game as you have more options that way, and there is considerably less downtime.  Play the game a lot single player and master the mechanics, lend the game to a dedicated friend and get them to do the same, and then try it 2 player.  If that works, repeat the process with 2 more people and Bingo - you've got yourself the most in depth game you've ever played.  Otherwise you just have an amazing idea, well executed and beautifully made, that is just a little too much hard work to be truly enjoyable.

I can't praise the game enough. It's theme permeates every aspect of the game: you're a Mage Knight, gifted with nearly god-like powers and supreme competence, out to explore and conquer the map. You can hire natives, interact with dwellings and cities, visit magical glades and mines, or just lie down and heal. Sooner or later, though, it's time to unleash your fury, and you do this by managing your deck of cards and planning your strategy. Under the threat of the round ending before you're done, you've got to be clever and efficient.

The game reminds me of Magic Realm on occasion, but it's simpler and full of action and excitement. MR is a tough game to crack, but Mage Knight lets you in and welcomes you. Both games will capture your imagination and keep you thinking about strategies and failures (and victories!) long after you've put the box away.

I love a game that plays well no matter how many players there are. Play solo and you'll have a blast; add more people and you'll find an even richer experience. Downtime is minimal, and your fellow players can both directly and indirectly affect your turn (this isn't Runebound).

The game is beautiful, the rulebooks are EXCELLENT, and the atmosphere of the game is compelling, engrossing, and fascinating. It gets the coveted 10.

A dry deck building game, that is really random due to card draw.  Draw your hand each turn, try to do something useful, Repeat.  Steep learning curve, long play time, very little player interaction, no excitement or feeling of danger in battles.  Massively overrated, due to the theme and great artwork, but a generally boring game.

My first heavy modern board game and blew me away! I've had tens of hours of fun playing this solo or duo. Never realised a board game could present you with so much brain food. It will get you agonising over the best way to use each hand you're presented with, taking risks in dark dungeons or tackling a mighty dragon hiding in the hills. 

A beautiful blend of maths efficiency puzzle and fantasy adventuring.

On the negative side, it's a seriously painful exercise learning the rules. Tonnes of exceptions and i'm not sure all need to exist, but it's well worth the pain. 

Also could have done better on the theme, its' quite cheese fantasy. I mean... 'WolfHawk'? Come off it

Fantastic fantasy game that is surprisingly easy to learn, but difficult to master.  Although it looks intimidating, the programmed instruction rule book introduces the game in bite sized chunks.  Each turn you're faced with many options that grows your hero's power and influence.  Finally, there is so much re-playbility in the box that I can see nearly limitless possibilities.

RATING: 5
This game is okay. It's a beautiful game with many cool pieces. But, the beauty of it can't, for me, overcome three big issues.

It's too freaking long. I played a game with four players and it took five hours. There are too may rules and too much that a player has to manage on one turn. Even if you know what you're going to do on your turn you're stuck waiting for the other players to plod through their turns. 

There is no excitement in the game. If you've suffered through getting your hand right, you know the outcome of facing a challenge before you go into it. There is no chance for real risk, and that thrill is absent from the game. Turns are players mumbling to themselves about what they can do or are going to do with their decks. The only real chance in the game is how far or how little you'll move during a given turn. All-in-all, pretty bland. 

There are too many complexities to manage in the game. I know some may like that, but the management of minutia has robbed this game of its thrill. I felt like I was an accountant in a Dungeons & Dragons game gone bad, more than I felt like I was Tovag the Conqueror.

It's not terrible, though. I don't want to play it again, but it's not Axis and Allies bad. I was just bored a lot during game play and never felt threatened or at risk during the game. And again, it's way too long.

Excellent adventure game that your group of players decide how to play (competitive, coop, mix of the two?).
The game seems heavy, but once you have understood what the rules are and elements, you surprise yourself by saying how simple it is. Good player aids help understand the icons. The two booklets coming with the game are well made and are thorough. The miniatures are great although totally unnecessary. Gameplay is fluid and fun.

A well made and well greased game.

Thumbs up and to buy!

I played this game two player and came away fairly unsatisfied. None of the mechanics felt deep enough to really scratch an itch, so even though the game offers a lot, and there is a lot to keep track of, I never really felt that involved. In addition, it is practically a solitaire game, which doesn't really appeal to me. The fantasy theme is great, and there is fun to be had in the game, but all the enjoyable elements fail to come together for me, and the game isn't solid enough to me to ingratiate and validate its long run time.

Quite well balanced. Offers quite a lot of variation and customized rules. You can make your own scenarios. It is more of a game system than just a game. I highly recommend to read through the books alone at first and not try it out as a group and read the rules parallel. It will get confusing and take up a LOT of time. But the game system is very simple if you do this, and there are just a few special situations in which there's confusion. 

There's so many differences with action cards, spells, skills, map, enemies, scenarios so you can definitely play this game 10 times in a row and still it won't feel repetitive.

If you want a massive game in your board game collection this I highly recommend, since you can play it alone, and with multiple friends.

Only issues I have with this game is that it will ALWAYS take a lot of time. Sometimes you're in the mood to play a game but only want to do it for a while. The other issue is that people cannot play parallel really (which is why it takes up a lot of time). So there is time wasted just waiting for other players.

The wealth of options (advanced actions, spells, artifacts, skills, units) that your hero can acquire together with the unpredictability of the map layout and enemies makes it replayable though I wish it integrated the theme a little better.

The perfect puzzle game for solo gamers. 

I have not tried playing with other players but imagine it would be a lot of fun too. Difficult getting my brother/friends free for 4 hours of uninterrupted play when you have families and work.

Edited Jan 2017 downgrade to 8. Like the idea of playing but know I have to set aside at least 3 hours.

I think I could get lost in this game for a very, very long time...

(edit) and I did, for about a month straight. Then I ran into a post in the variants forum about using the game as a pornographic tool. I complained to the BGG admins, they did nothing, and I couldn't imagine going back to this game after that.

One note: gameplay takes forever, and that was a big turnoff for my game group. Ended its life as a single-player and then shipped it off.

As I mainly play games solo (I need more friends), I have to say how much I enjoy this game! Setup can take a while and you need ALOT of space to be able to lay it out efficiently. The game comes packed with loads of cards, tokens and more and can be quite daunting at first, but fear not, it also has a rulebook and an easier walkthrough style book to get you playing in no time whilst learning the basic rules. Don't get me wrong, this is a very in-depth game and you have the option to make it much more complicated if you wish, but you can get setup fairly quickly (fairly for me was about 40mins). All in all a great game in my eyes and one I enjoying playing a lot!

Wielce rozbudowana i złożona gra, świetne łączy przygodę i klimat z zaawansowaną mechaniką. Jednak poprzez mnogość i nadmiar zasad (choćby ruch) jest strasznie uciążliwa i męcząca. Duży downtime, więc nadaje się raczej do gry solo lub we dwoje.

RATING: 8
Rating based on 2-player and solitaire games.  Down to a '7' with 3-player, and a '5' with 4-players.  Downtime increases with more players, without an increase in fun.

For the wargamers, think of city assaults as 'STAVKA' turns; for each player there will be a city, and each city will probably be assaulted twice.  With 2 players, this isn't so bad because the other player can help with the accounting and plan his next move.  With more than 2 players, the others are going to be frequently bored.

RATING: 4
This could have been an excellent adventure game, but it is severely marred by excessive complexity. Using deck building as the core mechanic is an interesting and novel idea in the genre, but it makes every turn a puzzle to figure out, particularly when it involves fighting monsters. Combat is so fiddly, with all the special abilities and resistances of monsters and allies, that the game really drags with analysis paralysis.

Most rule details seem to have a thematic reason, but this game would actually have benefited from more abstraction. The rules for putting monster tokens on the map are a good example: depending on the kind of location, they are placed face up or down, and in some it differs whether it's day or night. For cities, you always reveal them when you are adjacent, but you do it for keeps and towers only during the day, and not for dungeons until you explore them. I have come to expect some fiddliness from Vlaada, but here he took it to a wholly new level, with two long rulebooks to cover everything.

The publisher contributed further to harm the game with errors and a tiny font in the rules and components, not to mention a likely imposition on the designer to include their "clix" dials. They are used in absolutely unnecessary city miniatures just to set their level when they are revealed. Reference cards would have been much more practical and less expensive, but, instead, the important info is on annoying and extremely hard-to-read dials that WizKids have to include in every game they produce, for no good reason.

In the end, the game is just too complex and too long, even in solo mode, and with too much downtime with other players. I admit I enjoyed my three plays (two solo games and one with another player), but I guess I'm done with it.

Simply Amazing game. Obsession, always thinking about the game even when I am not playing. Could be the perfect game.

My first and only 10.

It has everythign I love. RPG game with adventure. Core mechanic is a card drafting/hand management which I like. But it is also puzzly as you have to determine the best action to do this turn with the cards you have and how best use the combinaison of cards, abilities and units to acheive what you want to do this turn. 

The is also this Epic feeling everytime you start a game and how stronger you get as the game advance. The only downside is the lenght if time to play it. I seriously would not play this game with more than 2 unless everyone has played this game multiple times before. I mostly play this solo because none of my friend knows the game well enough to play it with me. I understand their feeling because the rules to learn are massive with details. It does require commitment to learn this game but when you do, Wow, you are in for a ride!

Great game brought down by a multi-player system which is not conducive for new players. 
You cannot bring this game to a game night and have a pick up and play with brand new players. This game requires studying, which I loathed at first and then I loved because I understood the game.
The Lost Legion expansion ramped the difficulty once I got too cocky with the game. A must have for solitaire players.
Wishlist: Better miniatures (give us proper unpainted ones), 3D tiles (that would be so absolutely amazing) and an MK lite version which can be played with 4 players under 2hrs.

7 como puntuación inicial.

MK es un juego de aventuras, exploración, aliados, misiones, enemigos y un largo etc, todo ello desarrollado y al parecer muy bien implementado con mecánicas adoptadas de los juegos dirigidos por cartas y los juegos de construcción de mazos.

A primera vista parece que la gestión del mazo inicial es lo mas importante. Las reglas están bien implementadas para la curva de aprendizaje que tiene el juego.

En el lado negativo podemos encontrar que a 4 jugadores puede haber mucho tiempo muerto, algo que el diseñador a querido minimizar en todo momento con diferentes reglas, tiempos y consejos que da en el tutoríal del juego

----------

Nota rebajada por no cumplir para mi con el objetivo para el que creo que está diseñado.
Tras una segunda partida las expectativas sobre este juego como juego de aventuras han bajado bastante en cuanto se refiere a las reglas originales.

El juego funciona muy bien con 2, pero con 4 jugadores para mi y para el grupo con el que quiero jugar a este juego tiene varios problemas que debemos solucionar si quiere ver mesa.

### Efecto líder
Si alguien consigue despegar es muy difícil que los otros jugadores puedan echarle el guante y encima es algo que puede producirse de forma casual al empezar la partida:
**Supuesto 1** Comienzas tu partida y vas a por una ficha de orcos, la das la vuelta y ohhhh, suerte, puedes bloquearla sin mucha dificultad y te los cargas con una carta potenciada con mana, te dan 4 puntos de fama y subes de nivel, en los turnos siguientes te vas a por la torre de mago con tu nueva habilidad  y una carta avanzada en la mano la ficha no es muy tocha y te cepillas a los guardianes de la torre pillas un hechizo y o has vuelto a subir de nivel o andas cerca del siguiente, tienes varias cartas tochas en el mazo y puedes ir enfrentandote a lo que vaya saliendo.

**Supuesto 2** El siguiente jugador se va a por la otra ficha de orco, esta es de las que sacas un monstruo de otra pila que pega por el, pruebas suerte pero salen unas ratas que lo devoran todo y te comes 7 cartas de daño, te quedas un turno curandote de la paliza que te han dado y luego sigues tu camino aunque por lo menos subes de nivel.

**Supuesto 3** Los otros dos jugadores se van al pueblo para ver si pillan algo porque no hay mas bichos y los otros dos jugadores ya están en el segundo nivel.

El caso es que como uno logre despegar tiene un mazo mas poderoso que hace que pueda enfrentarse medianamente a los peligros del juego y los demás anden corriendo de un sitio a otro.

### Los tiempos muertos
El grupo con el que probé el juego es bastante agradecido y lo de los tiempos muertos lo llevamos bastante bien si el juego es lo suficientemente narrativo y el tema está integrado (y este es así), pero considero que el juego es absurdamente complejo para jugadores temáticos interesados en jugar aventuras y muchas de las decisiones las tomamos en plan mente colmena, el jugador ponía lás cartas sobre la mesa y entre todos resolvíamos el puzzle en función de lo que quisiera hacer, esto no es malo de por si, pero frustra una barbaridad.

### El enriscamiento o quedarte aislado sin poder moverte.
Para mi lo peor del juego y en algo que coincidimos todos los jugadores: que te veas de noche rodeado por fichas de bosque y wastelands o por el día rodeado de desiertos y mas wastelands ¿Por donde sales? Y ¿Cuanto vas a tardar? Si el tener que salir de un desierto a base de conseguir 5 puntos de movimiento se considera divertido y desafiante apaga y vamonos.

El movimiento es muy costoso y penalizante lo que te niega posibilidades y tomas de decisiones y esto con cuatro jugadores es muy acusado. Cuando juegas a un juego de aventuras uno tiene que ser libre de intentar y de elegir su propio camino pero con un movimiento tan limitado los jugadores invierten un montón de tiempo en optimizar las 5 cartas y no en decidir si voy a un dungeon, asalto el castillo o contrato mercenarios, 
 Simplemente te dedicas a buscar el mejor combo para arañar puntos.

### Conclusión (parcial)
Mage knight es muy buen juego y esta muy bien desarrollado, pero tiene una curva de aprendizaje y unas mecánicas que parece diseñado por Uwe Rosenberg para la franquicia del Agrícola y no como juego de aventuras donde uno explora y machaca a amigos y enemigos, si quiero que vuelva a ver mesa tengo que crear unas reglas caseras que hagan mas fácil el movimiento y de esta manera evitar el enriscamiento, esto reduciría los tiempos muertos e indirectamente creo que acabaría con el efecto líder al dar mas posibilidades de hacer cosas a los jugadores. Tal y como están redactadas las reglas no cumple con el objetivo de ser un juego de aventuras, por lo menos para nosotros.

### Bola extra
Las cartas son de ínfima calidad y se pelan solas, estas hay que enfundarlas si o si.

RATING: 6
Ok, had my first play and I have mixed feelings about this game. There are two games: the actual game and the game of ACTUALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES. What a fiddly game - the designer seemed to want to overly complicate things just.. because. So many things could be simpler here. Combat is horrible. Taking damage? Got damn, complicated as hell - to the point of me mentally regretting entering combat just because I know if I take damage I have to keep remembering how the mechanic of taking damage works. Setup was a nightmare. It took me about 20 minutes to setup the game.

The game walkthrough and rulebook do help - but it is not as well explained and well edited as it could be. The letters are WAY too small, and sometimes there is this humongous mass of text that you need to search for a specific ruling or explanation and you feel like reading the bible. This could be easily solved with more title descriptions, paragraph separations and general hierarchy of information - and BIGGER text. I made a LOT of mistakes because I didn't understand the rules properly. I had to keep coming back to the game walkthrough and it was a pain to find the information I wanted.

Having said that, I was actually in the zone with the game. I really enjoyed it once we grasped the rules and I was eager to discover more tiles, kill more monsters, deck build and enter dungeons and monster dens.

I really want to play it more but the back of my brain is actually screaming "OH GOD WHY", when it remembers the rules and the setup of the game. I hope the next session will be smoother but that is not how a game should treat its players.

Heroes of Might and Magic, this is the videogame I thought about when I finished the first game. The walkthrough was great in guiding me through this parallel universe. Really, I cannot yet believe the richness of the contents out of the box. Solo, coop and competitive modes; exploration and conquest; leveling up; army and resource management; everything creates a complex but satisfying experience. Now I'm looking seriously forward to a human opponent (or coop).

[UPDATE after 4 solos and one coop]
The more I play, the more I raise my final score. I keep sticking with one character to grasp his nuances. More and more streamlining of deck usage.

Lo que se de este juego es que es muy bruto (el mas "pesado" de toda la lista hasta la fecha -sept, 2016-), complejo y largo de jugar. 

en lo basico, es un dungeon crawler con evolucion de atributos del jugador, pero esa descripcion es quedarse muy corto. 

es uno de esos juegos que me gustaria probar una vez para al menos rajar de el a gusto con conocimiento de causa :D

It's interesting, and fun, and it gets a lot of things right. I'm not sure I enjoy the puzzle aspect of how to play your cards, though, and the advancement seems weird--your deck improves very little in terms of card churn, but gains very powerful cards when used correctly (spells especially)--but your non-deck stuff grows by leaps and bounds. The game is thus about bringing to bear those crushingly effective card combinations and milking your deck well. In an actual deck-builder, you'll go through your deck many times--here, you'll go through it six times max. It's weird but intriguing. 
The biggest issue is the length. I'm not sure it justifies its playtime, but I think it does--barely.

RATING: 10
Absolutely fantastic. This is a GREAT game. I say this with confidence after aprox 20 solo plays. So replayable, so much to keep you coming back for. As thematic as it is, make no mistake - MK is a euro through and through. 

Had some component issues: 4 cards were missing (3 for arythea and 1 artifact), instead I got 4 duplicates of other cards. Submitted replacement request on Wizkids website on 01/13/2012, received shipping confirmation on 01/22/2012, received replacements on 02/07/2012. Coloring on new cards is slightly darker than originals :(

Criticism of the rulebook is warranted. While not the worst I've read, it definitely over-complicates and intimidates. Much has been said about people's preference regarding walk-through and rules being seperate. To this I'll add that things are often repeated and/or restated in different ways and places. Rules writing is an art; look no further than a Chad Jensen game to see how complexity should be distilled. (Don't let this scare you; the rules aren't terrible. They just could have been done better.)

So what do I like about it? Beautiful to look at when playing - modular board, cute dice, minis (some with click bases), cards with great art, consistent iconography. Nice mechanics - deck building, choices choices choices, resource mgmt (crystals). Note that the game is VERY stingy with resources and new cards for your deck. Engine building - your mage knight starts out with great power and ends up with INSANE power.

Game is great. Awesome for solitaire play.

I had high expectations, but they all got crushed hard...

There's really nothing interesting in this game, but pure boredom. The theme is just not there. I never felt like I was building up my character nor my deck and for sure it never felt like an adventure game at all.

Instead you can be stuck with your cards, like having attack cards and no movement cards, but no enemy in sight or vice versa.

"Heroes of Might and Magic" did a MUCH better job, even though I didn't like the combat there. "Thunderstone" is more luck dependent and is overcomplicated aswell, but it feels much more like an adventure game than this one. Upgrading your units, fighting them and all this just feels better there and it plays way faster, too.

A huge disappointment.

Mage Knight is mostly touted for its suitability for solo play and that's inevitably where it shines. I absolutely love the rules, which many here have complained about. They are extremely thematical and intuitive and they give solo players enough options to ponder to really immerse themselves into this world. 

However, I would never ever play this with a friend. It's too heavy a game for that and in retrospect I'm glad that this was one the first board games I bought when I got into the hobby since now I know to stay away from heavy games not intented for solo play.

Mage Knight is very pretty and I like the depth of rules but the base game doesn't really have the appeal that modern games do. These days you've got legacy games, different missions and all that. MK really only has 1 mission. This comes with different variations but the changes are tiny. Basically you're just roaming the world quite aimlessly. The Lost Legion expansion introduces a much needed boss to fight but it's quite expensive for what it is. Another thing I have an issue with is the card drafting process. You're constantly in the position where you just wanna move but your cards only aid you to fight. There's nothing brain burning or puzzling about this, it's just frustrating. The battles on the other hand are delicious and that's where the puzzle reveals itself as you're desperately trying to optimize your hand and thinking how many wounds you want to take. The deck building aspect is beautifully designed aswell, although the magic cards are rarely at play.

All in all, MK is a very good game but it needs an update to introduce different missions etc. In comparison I would whole-heartedly recommend Mechs vs Minions for solo play. Tons to play with a cheaper price tag and it works with larger player counts aswell. It's a whole different genre but it's just as puzzly.

This is the first game I've played that takes the great mechanism behind Dominion and actually makes a game that's better with it. Even though it's fiddly as hell to set up, even that is a pleasure thanks to the lovely components. And quite how he managed to get so much deep thought into a fun fantasy epic is where you're essentially bashing orcs to level up is beyond me. Bravo. I'd rate it higher if it played well with more people; unfortunately, even as a three-player, it can really drag on.

Joc d'aventures tipus eurogame amb desenvolupament de personatges, l'atzar és gairebé inexistent i les mecàniques funcionen molt bé amb la temàtica.

Downtime molt alt en partides de més de 2 jugadors, ideal per jugarlo en solitari.

Actualització després de més partides: el joc em continua semblant bò, però és molt fluix com a joc d'aventures... El fet que sigui tant puzzle, que totes les localitzacions funcionin igual i que no hi hagi "sorpreses", fa que el tema cada vegada es vegi més difuminat i que passi a ser més un euro que no un joc d'aventures i, com a euro, n'hi han de millors (especialment tenint en compte la seva duració i dificultad, a més de no escalar gens bé). Ara per ara, només el considero per jugar en solitari i mai ho faig, de manera que té moltíssimes poques possibilitats de veure taula.

After a couple plays, I feel like this has potential to be a popular game with the local group. It's a tight design that emphasizes good quality play. It's not very forgiving of mistakes, due to the way it forces players to race to arrive first a limited set of objectives, so I imagine that new players trying to join experienced players might be frustrated.

I'm rating it as an 8 for solo play, or for groups of relatively equal skill. For mixed-experience groups, I think coop play might be way to go, or else this game might drop back to a 6.

Very good fantasy adventure game. Rules are surely complex and game has myriad of components, but making epic feeling adventure game elegant is probably impossible.

The gameplay is not shallow dice-throwing, but action optimization by deciding with cards use now and which save for later (as basic card powers are cumulative). The pressure of opponent using cards faster than you add the necessary incentive to make hard decisions on how to use your cards. My only negative(ish) argument is: the pressure could even be a fraction higher. (Getting full extra turn after opponent passes, feels quite generous: really hard to rush and punish opponent much).

Playing time requirement is truly grand, easily several (4+) hours, especially with people who like to think and try to play well (like me). But if you find opponent who prefers playing pace similar to you, playing this is great experience.

RATING: 9
Mage Knight: The Board Game is primarily an adventure game. You get a hero and wander the countryside killing monsters and getting treasure. It's a fun theme, if not particularly original. What really sets is apart though is its use of deckbuilding mechanics to customize your character as the game goes on. Upgrading and learning new skills are ubiquitous in this type of pseudo-RPG, so it's a perfect fit.

Each player receives a pre-painted figure and their own deck of cards. The figures do seem to play rather differently from each other, but none seems to have weaknesses to the point that they cannot succeed at certain tasks. This is a good thing. Each card in a player's deck has a couple different uses and the game really forces you into some tough decisions about how to spend your cards and resources. Even when you get to add new cards to your deck, you will have some tough choices to make about which one best fits your deck and your overall strategy.

The components here are of notably excellent quality. I suppose the price reflects this, but it really shines. The tiles are of thick stock, the pre-painted figures are easily identifiable and look right at home in the world. Even small tokens are nicely illustrated. The lone drawback may be that the colors of the plastic crystals can be tough to distinguish from one another.

This is a really solid effort that ends up being a lot of fun to play. The very minor complaints I can muster are that it tends to bog down the more players there are, and that I wish there were more opportunities to add cards to your deck. You add cards to your deck about as often as you would expect to find a treasure or learn a skill in an adventure game. Since you use your deck for everything from moving to fighting, you will sometimes cycle it without even adding a new card. Again, these are very minor complaints it what is ultimately a really fun game.

Amazingly good - mixes many disparate elements into an interesting and engaging game. Just keep the player count at 3 or below or else turns get too long. Oh, and don't do PvP.

The whole levelling up and adventuring and slaying monsters business is really well-implemented here. I can't stop thinking about this game, and can't help wanting to play again.

A deck building game with a purpose. A tile based map and random encounters give this game lots of replay value. I'm also a big fan of having some co-op scenarios and some competitive scenarios.

One of the worst ruleset I ever read though. Why are there some rules and icon descriptions only in the walkthrough guide and not in the rulebook? If I need a clarification I have to search through two books for it. Gimmie a fucking index at least. If you wanted to take a rulebook/playbook approach you should have hired someone at GMT to do your rules.

DECK BUILDING???

Horrible rules.  The game is not half as complicated as it seems by reading the rules.  And where the game is "complex", it feels like it is complexity for the sake of complexity. Also, the game is the same puzzle repeated.  It is *not* a deck building game in the least: you don't have the leisure to alter the odds of having one card or the other, and your deck is not cycled that many times, which leads to another problem: randomness.  Unlike most people think, the more you throw the dice/draw cards, and the less random things feel because odds even out.  This game is a thinky luckfest, not a great combination imo.  
As a solitary game, it is a decent adventure game because you don't suffer the downtime; if you want a solo, fantasy game this might be a fit.

Hands down my uncontested solo game of choice (context: solitaire games are my bae)! Perfectly hits every single chord of my fanatical RPG tastes. Even better with other people willing to sit down and learn the (admittedly fiddly) rules. In my opinion, the complexity is part of its charm. Every game feels like a brain racking puzzle, and I loves me my brain teasers! The game expands super well and gives a sense of discovery that can be extremely hard to achieve through the board game medium. No other game will quite be able to fill the niche Mage Knight is going for.

This was the most disappointing game I have played in a long time.  I love Vlaada!  I was very curious to see how he approached both deckbuilding and the dude-on-a-map genre. It just didn't work at all.  WAY more complex than I was lead to believe from the reviews here.  And honestly, interesting decisions were few and far between.  Lots of tedium and downtime, nearly zero good tension.  Unbalanced as hell and clearly not fully developed. A real drag.

I especially didn't like the fact that there was almost no player-interaction in the co-op mode.. the competitive mode doesn't really make sense from what i heard.. that's why many people simply like playing it solo..

Mage Knight is nice game. I like the aspect of adding to the deck and making your character more powerful. The characters have some difference as there was 2 or 3 cards difference between them, but it does affect game play. As you level up the differences are widened with the special abilities you get. It is a bit long though and wouldn't suggest going for a 4 player game. Rules are a bit complicated and sometimes it is hard to find the rule you think should be there to verify it.

Mage Knight is... well, it certainly proves to be another typical Chvatil game (if there is such a beast), with (a) lots of different pieces needed to track exactly what is going on, (b) required playtime greater than usually expected, (c) very nice graphic elements, (d) plenty of theme, (e) well-written rules which, (f) are always still extremely complicated to read/learn/use.

FWIW, I'd have to say that the bits in Mage Knight are among the best I've seen in any non-collector edition games.

Nevertheless the whole thing seems a little piecy on a first play- which I guess is also typical of Vlaada's games.

I own/have owned Prophecy, Through the Ages, Dungeon Lords and now Mage Knight; I have to say that not one of these has played simply yet deeply enough to catch on here with my family, and that this is the single biggest problem I have had with Chvatil games.

Still there's a lot of promise in this one, that beyond the artwork there's a lot of solid game, if you can find the time for it.

I am reserving a rating until after further plays- like other Chvatil games this one needs a bit of effort to really know and appreciate, and unlike Dungeon Lords I am hopeful that this one will eventually get familiar enough to catch hold.

I've had this game on my shelf for years now.  Unfortunately, the first time I played it I disliked it.  Tried it again six months later and started to understand it, but put it away because it didn't click with me.  A few months after that I set it up, ran through the rules (again), and absolutely loved it.  If this game doesn't agree with you at first please give it another go.  This is definitely one of the best solo sandbox games in print today.

This game is everything I wanted Runebound to be.

Subsequent plays showed me that downtime is deadly in this game, making it a solitaire-only proposition for me. I'm not so keen on solitaire play, so I traded it away.

The rampant and varied quality control issues plaguing each print run means I won't be picking it up again. The thought of facing WizKids' annoyingly difficult product replacement process just kills all my enthusiasm for this game. 

If some publisher other than WizKids picks this up, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

Some may see this as a bad thing, but this is the only game I've played that gives me a degree of analysis paralysis. That's why it's best solo but also why it's so satisfying.

Brain fry!  A nice game with a lot of different ways to play.  I finally had a chance to play with 4 others, one of which is a very experienced player.  The rest were noobs.  It's not that tough to get the rules down as the booklets might let on.  Once you get the pattern of sequence, it flows fairly well and quickly.  What is most intimidating is the idea that you have sooooo many options on how to use your available cards.  They can be taken at face value (per their instructions) or tapped for movement, influence, combat, or defense.  I do like the flexibility on how you can spend and use 'action' points.  This is a great game for an evening with friends and beer.  Turn on music instead of TV for background ambiance if you must.  TV will suck away valuable neurons

Α long, fiddly, complicated beast. Rules, exceptions, more rules,more exceptions, woven into this generic fantasy game, with the most detestful player characters ever in a boring world filled with orcs, dragons and other overused creatures.

One of the most interesting and very challenging solo games I own, and I suspect this will get a lot of time on the table.  There's not a ton of different built in options for solo scenarios, but the basic full solo conquest has plenty of variety to keep me coming back!  Amazingly clever and smart system with excellent mechanism-to-theme conversion.  Feels euroish while still unabashedly being a fantasy adventure with all that entails.  Epic in all senses of the word.

Rating 2 - won't ever play this again.

Pros:
* Great artwork on cards
* Pre-painted miniatures are better than bland unpainted plastic.

Cons:
* "Elegant mechanics" can't make up for what is an extremely tedious game.
* Deck-building element seems like a forced cash-in for the genre craze and ultimately sucks the fun out.
* Speaking of forced, it's lame how WizKids forces the Clix thing into every god damn game they make, whether the inclusion makes sense or not.

Ask about the best solo board game and Mage Knight will be the top answer. 

It is really good. It is really long. Even set up takes a lot of time and you need quite a lot of space. The game itself is complex. But once you get your head around the rules, it becomes more intuitive. And the complexity allowes for depth of play. 

The mechanics remind me quite a lot of D&D Dungeon Command. You use cards to do almost anything, e.g. move, attack, etc. This isn't altogether a bad thing as I really like Dungeon Command. It's also funny how there's no combat dial (except on castles) which is what made the original Mage Knight unique.

Thematically, it's a lot like Runebound, which (although not specified as such) is also easy to play solo. I like the uniquness of the token combat system in Runebound, but Mage Knight has a modular board that can change and I like Mage Knight's mana generation system. Both games are currently 9s for me. 

While Mage Knight's 99% great, there are a few minor downsides. So far it doesn't feel like I'm playing a board game so much as a card game; I spend most of my time looking at and using my cards, not so much time looking at the game board or interacting with my figure. Speaking of the figures, they are very poorly painted. It would have been better if they came unpainted. I'm going to repaint them.  

Overall, a great game, but I only just got it. I'd like to see its longevity.

This is actually a computer game masquerading as a board game. It is bursting with character special skills, elemental enemies, alternate card abilities, random encounters, mana types, terrain, locations, followers etc. 

But take away a clean video-game interface then re-imagine all this laid out on the table. Evaluating moves involve juggling between skimming stacks of iconography and performing draining maths. Basic things such as how far you can walk or checking what dangers will kill you, take too much mental arithmetic. Repeat this turn after turn for the fiddly and slow-moving experience that is Mage Knight.

目前玩過最棒的遊戲，同時也是目前玩過最複雜的遊戲，是我愛的角色扮演，又同時極具策略性，攻擊防禦不再用骰子，變成一直在算數字，戰鬥是這遊戲最複雜的部份，玩起來很燒腦XD
打怪升級很有感覺，可以得到新技能/進階行動卡或命令指示物，透過不同方式得到法術/神器/部隊，並且善用他們，也是相當具有策略性
玩這個遊戲再度體驗到Vlaada在設計遊戲機制上的巧思，不過這次有點太over了，規則細節非常多，覺得有些地方可以再簡化些、再直覺些

After my first game of Mage Knight, I thought it might be interesting.  I wish it hadn't taken 3 hours (It suffers from painfully lengthy downtime waiting for other people to take their turns), and the frequent interruptions of my plans to discover yet another rules exception were annoying, but I thought both of those issues would diminish with repeat plays.

Game 2 was...worrying.  Game 3 cemented my opinion that it is in fact a terrible game.

If you don't draw your movement cards at the right time, you will be miserable.  Yes, at first the idea that you can spend any card to do anything at reduced effect seems like it would help, but in practice it just means that you end up spending your powerful combat cards moving to the combat, and then can't actually win the battle when you get there.  

If you fall behind, you are doomed.  This means that if someone else beats you to the easy fights (see issue with movement cards), you are doomed.  You will never catch up.  Worse, you will fall ever further behind, as the person who won the early fights will be powerful enough to beat the next difficulty of fight and grow more powerful, while you will languish in obscurity.  

Combat is too complicated and not actually exciting or fun.  There are so many exceptions and special rules that new players are guaranteed to think "okay, I finally have all the math worked out so that I can win this battle and not be wounded" and then find out that they can't even win the battle, let alone walk away unscathed.

I don't understand why this game is rated so highly by so many people...well, I understand some of the ratings - they are from people who admit that they have only played it solo so far, which means they haven't experienced the crushing misery of having someone else beat them to the thing they want to do and then not being able to do anything.  But the people who have played it multiplayer and still think it's great...I just don't get it.

This is, in my opinion, an absolutely perfect board game. 
The mechanics are rock solid. The rulebook, although dense, is put together in such a way as to make any rules questions easy to answer. The complexity of the game is handled in an easy-to-absorb fashion via the Introductory Scenario, and the continuing complexity of the game either makes an intuitive, logical sense, or is found where you would expect it to be in the rulebook.
This game makes sense after you play it the first time, and additional playthroughs reveal the depth of strategy and mechanics that this game has. I have never played this game the same way twice (due to how the cards are dealt, and the map tiles revealed), and yet, I have never felt that my chance at winning was destroyed due to not being able to do "the only winning strategy".
This games rewards tactical thinking without encouraging Analysis Paralysis, and always gives players an option of what to do, as long as they are willing to see what the best option is.
It is fun with any number of supported players, and fosters creativity in either a competitive or cooperative fashion, depending on how you are playing.
This game creates a real sense of adventure, and makes you feel like you have truly earned your victory with a sense of growth and challenge, without the looming specter of unfair failure that some "challenging" games have.

This is a heavy game to get into, but the combination of competitive, cooperative, and solo play; theme, mechanics, and endless re-playability make this game an absolute must have.

RATING: 6
My score is a little misleading, because I REALLY do enjoy Mage Knight. However, there is good reason for a lower score here:

This is a gamers game. It is hardcore, and unless playing a hardcore deckbuilding/RPG game gets you excited as hell immediately, it probably isn't for you. As my wife is my main game partner, I don't get to play this a lot. Being so niche hurts the ability to get it out with a group that will actually enjoy it. 

Other than that, learning the rules is a BEAR. Vlaada has some crazy big rule books but this takes the friggin' cake. You'll spend hours with the rules and still not have them down. The game is also fiddly, though not to the same degree as something like Arkham Horror.

All that said, if you get the right group down and you all know the rules, this game gets DEEP. Some seriously satisfying strategy can take place, and the fantasy RPG leveling element is fantastic for giving you a sense of progression and pace.

Overall, this is a great game but it is limited by having a small audience that would agree, and being such a pain to get into and learn.

Somehow, this has become our go-to two player game. :)  Yes, it's long, fiddly, mathy, convoluted, and swingy, and that doesn't bother me at all.  The card combos are great; even if you only get to execute a particular combo once or twice, the game goes out of its way to make sure you will get to use it and it will be awesome.  And in fact, that's kind of what the game is about--balancing set-up turns with turns of awesome, the turns where you march into a city and find out you have to kill the medusa and a dragon, and voila! you have the magic card that somehow lets you pull it off.  There's a lot of information that's available in advance for planning and figuring out the cleverest way to use the special cards. And because it's a Chvatil game, you get a little credit for everything you do.  

I probably wouldn't want to play this much with more than two, because it has really long turns and the downtime would be massive. But as a two player game, I'm kind of addicted to it... (4 or 5 plays?)

RATING: 8
Fantastic game. Extremely advanced for the average gamer though. Very high learning curve to not only learn the rules/combat system, but to learn how to actually WIN a game. Didn't win a game until my third playthrough. Also, prepare to spend between 2-6 hours playing, depending on the scenario and number of players. The entire time you're playing, is a huge race against the clock. I always want to play this game, but finding the time, and/or people to play with isn't always easy.

TLDR: Only game I've ever played that took over two hours, that I wanted to immediately play again.

Play cards to gain points (attack/move/heal/influence) and use those points to do stuff on the map. You can use mana to charge cards to get more points and use units which are basically anytime use cards.

Great game. I don't get to play this game as often as I'd like because of its length and complexity. The rulebook isn't the best one out there and makes it hard to get back to the game after you haven't played for a while. I printed a rules summary that helps a lot in this regard, the only thing I still have a hard time with is understanding all the different scenarios of the expansion. I've only played coop with 1,2 or 3 players and would recommend keeping it at 2 players, more than that it starts to drag near the end. Owned expansions : The Lost Legion; Krang; Shades of Tezla

WOW!  Everything you want in a fantasy-themed game.  Excellent core rules, lots of advanced rules and options, several scenario types (solo play, co-op play, competitive play) and terrific card-driven mechanics.  Can't wait to play this again.  The only downside is I suffer from analysis paralysis with this game more than any other.  Every hand of cards you draw is a puzzle to solve, and sometimes it takes a while to go through various permutations to figure out how to play your hand for optimal efficiency... to get one more point of blocking or one more ranged attack... or to decide if it's worth taking a wound in order to clear those ruins this turn, or play it safe and finish it off next turn...

A magnificent accomplishment of a board game--however, length, complexity, and tendency for a frustratingly wide array of choices with only the possibility of truly pursuing a few makes this a game which, for me, makes me feel a bit exhausted with it before I've even taken the box off of the shelf. 

I appreciate the artfulness of this game, but the enjoyment factor is still elusive. But, I may change my mind after more plays (or maybe after I've retired and can devote large swaths of time to it...)

Lets see if they ever release Mage Knight 2:

Less rules, better rules, better quests, less randomness, better ability and spell card balance and it might work out. Currently crappy. Only worth playing alone, theoretically.

It is actually a 3/10 game. Not a 1/10... but then again some games are just heavily overrated due to marketing and hype; so some underrating won't hurt.

Vlaada Chvátil Thank You. This is not a game for the masses ...But you designed a game I really enjoy. Every facet of this game is excellent, however, I do feel that the PvP combat is not that well conceived, that is the PvP combat is very different than the rest of the game and is often not worth even attempting for the lack of reward. Player elimination is non-existent.

Very sophisticated game design.  Several high-end game mechanics, mixed in with a lots of "cards with text" interacting with each other.

Strictly a gamer's game.  Not for a casual gaming audience.

Game may run a little long, but I was engaged the whole time.  I do not believe there is a runaway leader issue, but if you do not get your character leveling up early, you can get yourself in a spot where you cannot catch up.

Components were of good quality and cosmetically worked very well with the game.

With high complexity and alternate scenarios (solo game, co-op, pvp, exploring) Mage Knight promises lots of thing there are few games can offer to experienced gamers.

When you truely understand rules and setup, Mage Knight delivers  dozens of hour (6 hours per a mid-lenght scenario) with enjoyment. You can play against difficult challanges witohut any sign of boring.

If you want to get rid of simple rules, mechanics and want something more complicated, challenging game with hours to play, it is the game you are looking for.

Also Mage Knight is the best solo game i've ever play. It has tons of replayability, makes you feel exploring and with dummy player it creates so much tense to finish the scenario before the last night falls. I can easily say, Mage Knight is the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 of board game universe.

Brilliantly designed, but after two full campaigns I don't feel like repeating the experience. Admittedly I have only played it solo, but the analysis paralysis I've found it can cause makes me less keen on playing it with others. Also I personally found the unnecessary sexualization of the two female characters a bit off-putting and out of keeping with the rest of the design of the game.

It feels a little wrong to rate it below games like Love Letter and Splendor, and it does deserve its high rank on BGG, but it's not a game I enjoy too much now.

Luck factor: 4 - you might find yourself too often with the cards you needed the other turn, then get stuck with cards you don,t need at all. It what made me lower the rating so much, cause I liked the other aspects a lot.
Players interaction: I tried the cooperative game only, so it barely had active interuction at all, only for attacking cities. kind of weird, considering the fact it was cooperative game.
Play/Wait Ratio: It was first game so it was bad, but I guess even when knowing the cards you might wait a while 'till your next turn.
Replayability: 4. A lot of scenarios options, and different map every time. I'd give it 5 stars here, but the flows I mantioned earlier made me not very exited about playing it again too soon.

This is a great game. It is a fantasy game, where you tile explore and fight baddies, but the mechanics do not feel like the standard tile exploration/ kill baddies game. For me, one of the best part of playing a RPG Video Game is leveling up, and when I play Mage Knight I feel that excitement; like my next level is just within reach and I want to get it. My wife and 2 older kids, ages 9 1/2 and 11, also enjoy this game. My kids seem to understand the rules well enough, although they still need guidance from the parents, and the specific rewards/interaction at locations/and other less used rules require a player aid. I want to point out that this game does not feel like other dungeon crawlers. It does not capture the feeling of running for your life, constantly being assaulted from enemies and just trying to survive, like Castle Ravenloft or Drizzt (which are great by the way), but that is OK. I have several board games that fill different roles and I play the game that matches my gaming group's mood; MK is a great game that has a unique place in my game collection. I am glad I got this game, but after several plays, it does lack some of the excitement that it first had because there are no surprises when I fight or explore because there are few unusual surprises.

Errata 2: It's crazy but I actually picked this game up today. I am actually in a position now where playing games solo sounds like a viable option and this seems like one of the best solo games around. We'll see where the rating goes from here.

Errata: I think I am convinced that this is a great solo game but I just see no reason to play this with other people.

Original: Blegh... boring, overcomplicated, multiplayer solitaire at it's worst. I never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather play Talisman.

The way your actions are limited just feels contrived for the sake of having an "intersting mechanic". I understand that some people really love the whole puzzle solving aspect of Euros like this but not me.

Highly overrated.

[url=http://www.techuser.net/klondikeprob.html]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url] 

Most deck/pool-building games are uncontested-skill tests that focus on solving puzzles and optimizing probabilities at the expense of player interaction, and too often evolve into economic snowballs.

One of the most ambitious, ornate, yet elegant designs I've ever encountered. The fact that it's fantasy adventure, a genre I'm particularly fond of, is icing on the cake.

Mage Knight asks a lot of its players, but it is the most rewarding game that I own.

Great game, our gaming group loves it. Exploring, fighting monsters, leveling up and even burning down monasteries. We love it.

Only problem is that the game takes quite a long time to play. Especially with new players, a full game with new players can easily last 4-5 hours.

Played introductory scenario with 2. Enjoyed it. Would like to dedicate full day to full scenario. Nice bits. Tedious amount of rules with exceptions. Would NOT play without GM! Also, minimal interaction, so wouldn't play with more than 2 without PvP (& then there'd be MORE Rules). Did not like that wound cards stay in deck. [Is a battle-hardened warrior supposed to start bleeding spontaneously?] That makes the hand limit even more frustrating with too many cards that don't let you what you want to do.

RATING: 8.5
This game is amazing, I think that it has all that I look for in a high strategic board game. For me, the best thing, is the combination of one of my favorite mechanics (deck building) with a board game. It is kind of minor deck building as you are not going to buy/win that many cards during the whole game, but it is enough for having the feeling that you are building your future for the next rounds.
The artwork is amazing (no, the miniatures are not), there are so many interesting mechanics that I cannot highlight all of them (in part because the last time I played was some time ago). One thing that can be conflictive is how long the game is. It is one of those games where the duration of the game is increased for every player. But it is so strategic, so complicate and there are so many things that can be done for wining the game, that I have to say that I love the game
Positive:
1. Highly strategic
2. Many amazing mechanics
3. Deck building within a classic board game
4. It is very thematic
5. The artwork
Negative:
1. It may be too long
2. Difficult to explain and to play
3. Not recommended for inexperienced players
4. The miniatures

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Sounds pretty good but maybe too long and too complex for the return

Edit - Well I had read all the complaints ahead so was expecting some bumps or even holes in the road but overall enjoyed it, a little torn though as I figured.  Most of everything you want in a D&D type adventure game is here, but some things are done very very differently than any others of this type.  

- First off the deckbuilding.  Normally, plain old deck building and only that just bores me to tears, so don’t like it much at all.  Here though, I think it is a really good fit for the rest of the game and of course is only a small part of the game, it’s a great way of levelling up, picking a nice spell or advanced action which you’ll be able to use in future turns when they come to you.  So overall I like this aspect.  

- Levelling – I think this is the best aspect of the game, and probably what hooks most people on the game. These are some of your most important decisions, and you usually have a few options to choose from, also just getting rewards from battles was nice also improving your abilities in one way or another.  

- Movement and actions – Here we start down the slippery slope.  It can be quite frustrating getting a hand of cards you just can’t use, I don’t care if you have played the game 20 times, you are still going to get a hand of cards that don’t work for what you need or want to do.  So, I think you just have to accept this, and accept that your opponents will suffer the same fate, and when it happens just have a non-turn and move on.  If you can’t accept it, well MK is likely not going to be for you.  

- Monsters and attacks – Well at first I wasn't sure about the way combat was done, seemed a little too Euro for this type of game, but otoh the encounters that are known ahead see reduced luck.  Going into a Dungeon or encounter you don’t know, felt more like an adventure type game, but for the Brown Monsters if you randomly got the Werewolf you’d be screwed. I don’t think I liked the all of nothing defence rules, where if you could not defend it ALL, then you might as well defend nothing because you get attacked at full regardless, this felt wrong to me for this type of game, it’s a design choice and one I don’t think I liked. Its not a biggy though, and you could probably house-rule it in some way if you wanted it more traditional.  

- Mercs – This was another cool aspect, hiring mercenaries to help you in battles. 

- Analysis Paralysis – Probably one of the worst features of the game. The trouble is with the cards, and some of the rule restrictions, so you have this hand of 5 to 7 cards, and there is something you want to do, and sometimes you need to go through all the permutations to see IF you can do it, and how well, like often there is 3 to 10 ways to try and accomplish something with the cards you have, so great you have some options, but the way they are presented to you just creates a bad type of analysis. While after 5, 10 or more games this will improve, its never going to totally disappear either.  

- Strategy/Downtime – If you do play with more than 2, downtime is going to suck regardless, unless you have some really fast players who don’t care about optimizing their turn. With only 2, the mana dice availability is more deterministic and you should be able to mostly plan your next turn waiting for the other player, even with more, when the person ahead of you is going you know most of the dice available and can still mostly plan your turn, so while downtime IS bad you can still mostly plan for your turn, though with more its harder and cards will change more, the map changes more etc. As far as Strategy in general, planning more than one turn ahead is pretty tough, and it sure looks like game long plans are not possible to me, not that “that” is needed or anything especially for this genre, it would be nice sure so just an observation that the way things build up and change here long term planning isn't possible mostly or at all.  

- Player number – due to the AP, the shear amount of rules and the game length, NO way would I be playing with more than 2 people, its probably best a solo game in many ways, but two works good too.  

- Rules – It does seem like there is just too much, and you have to wonder if many things could have been streamlined a little more, boiled down to lesson this burden of learning and look-up etc.  

- Luck – I felt it was okay overall, maybe it’s a little high for the length of the game, but again playing with 2 players I think gives you a shorter game and reduced luck effect so its really the way to go for this.  

- Theme – Between the Deck building, the turn order card draft and a few other things it does take a little away I think from the theme, however I think in the end its still an adventure game and mostly still feels like one.  

My conclusion after one play is I am a little torn on this as you can likely see above, and I'm not sure if I am going to buy it.  On the one hand, it might be the one adventure game with the most meaningful decisions out there (Robinson is another). On the other, I worry that the rules overhead may keep the game on my shelf instead of on the table, and if you ever don’t play it for a few months and want to come back to it, HAH, good luck.

Only a few plays logged, but I can tell that this game has the potential to be one of my favorites.  I'm intrigued by the adventure aspects of the game along with the puzzle-like combat system.  Time melts away while playing this game.  I'm still learning the rules and figuring out strategy, but so far I'm really getting into this.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game with a very simple deckbuilding core, but that adds a lot of little rules to evoke the feeling of wandering around slaughtering monsters, gathering followers and becoming a powerful adventure. This is not a game to play for its mechanics; it's an experience, and one that takes the better part of a day in spite of ultimately simple core mechanic. But I feel like I see this game recommended alongside heavy euros, and that doesn't make any sense to me, it feels pretty ameritrashy (at least it's what I go to if I want something more thematic and more of an experience than a competition - and for that it's a good amount of fun.)

Another ten for Vlaada. Mage Knight scratches a particular itch for me, one that Through the Ages also does: it provides the player with a very rich optimization puzzle every turn to work through. Your resources are flexible enough and the possibilities wide enough that you always have things to work out. I've played this a bunch via VASSAL, and it's ideal in that format.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent as a solo game, lots of variability in what spells/actions/monsters/map tiles come out.

It's a bit of a slog to play with playtime easily being over 2hrs, but still fun nonetheless. A lot of the time is spent thinking about how best to play each hand, or deciding which direction to go, which monsters you think you are capable of fighting given the current strength of your deck/units etc; there are a lot of interesting decisions to make!

The best thing is that you defeat enemies through intelligent play as apposed to dice rolling. There is randomness in the game, but where it matters, you have plenty of information in order to plan for it.

This is my favourite solo game by a long shot, others I have enjoyed playing solo such as imperial settlers, caverna etc were fun for a few games, but you get to the point where you've figured the puzzle out, and any more plays need to be multiplayer in order to keep things interesting. This game has the variablity to last a lot longer, and does not need multiplayer interaction at all.

RATING: 9
Mage Knight is a game that I find myself regularly wanting to play.  It has a nice combination of being a fun brain burner, trying to figure just the right combination of cards and crystals to make a spectacular play, and gathering strength and power, while exploring a board.  There is some significant downtime while an opponent is taking their turn so the optimal number of players depends on how long it takes for each of you to plan out your next move.  You want more players if it takes longer and less if you're more experienced and quicker.  There seems to be very little direct player interaction since there is little incentive to fight so mostly it comes down to getting in each other's way.  Oftentimes it becomes almost cooperative as we all kibitz on the best move, especially late at night when our brains are getting sluggish and we need the help.  My main criticism is that it has a bit of a runaway leader syndrome since power begets power and there is little to restrain a frontrunner.  The characters are largely comparable but with enough asymmetry to make for interesting variety.  I expect with enough play it'll start getting repetitive but there's lots of replay value here due to its variety of cards and challenging nature to devise the optimal move.

RATING: 9
I love this game, but it's tough to get others interested in playing (too long, too many rules..). The solo and co-op conquest scenarios are very difficult (for me, at least), but I love agonizing over which card combinations to play. 

The difficulty of teaching this game and the lack of concise/complete player references make this a 9 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While the fantasy table-top theme works fine, this is actually a brain-burning hand management puzzle.

In a full game you're only going to see your deck (which starts at 16 cards) 6 times. You'll add a few cards to it, deck builder style, but you're only going to see them a few times. Everything you do needs to be efficient, and you have to snowball quickly to make maximum use of earned cards, skills, and units (face-up helpers that you can recruit). To be sure, your deck can become super strong compared to what you started with, but that's mainly a thing that you're building up to for use on the last couple rounds.

I enjoy it quite a bit. I would not want to play it with anyone who suffers from AP. There are way too many decisions on a given turn about how to play out your hand, and people can become entirely lost and frozen if they aren't willing to take a risk.

The components are great. Cards are standard poker sized, so regular Magic sleeves work. You can use opaque sleeves for most of the cards, but the reference cards will need clear sleeves. I used clear on the units as well, so that I could tell the two decks apart.

Note: The rules are a disaster as a reference. It's one of those "let's gather 'round and hear a story about how this game is played" rule books. My recommendation for learning is:

1. Read the getting started book.
2. Slog through the intro game.
3. Read and memorize absolutely everything.

Don't subject a gaming group to this if you don't have the rules down cold. It's long enough as it is. You will not be able to "look that one thing up real quick" because whatever you're looking for is guaranteed to be hidden in the last place you'd ever think about looking.

RATING: 9
It can be a long game, but you can always use fewer tiles for a shorter game. We can get through an 10-tile, 1-city game in a couple hours.

When I bought this I was ready for a difficult game, but it's not that hard to learn, really. I don't need to refer to the rule book all that often.

The long setup is the primary drawback to the game. Some days I'd like to play Mage Knight but dread the setup, so I settle for a simpler game.

[Edit: After 18 plays I like it just as much as I did when I first started playing it. Increasing rating from an 8 to a 9.]

RATING: 5
It packs some clever gameplay, but I am rather sick of the tendency of modern boardgame to replace character attributes and equipement by decks of cards. This feels like a game by Corey Koniezka, and I do not mean this as a compliment, because, while I like his games, they all seem the share the same kind of flaws which I'm really sick of.

It also feels soulless and not very thematic. The game is also not appealing visually at all, especially for the kind of game is it (adventure/RPG).

But mostly, mostly, this game has one of the worse combos of low-player interaction and very long downtime that I have ever witnessed, even worse than Merchants and Marauders!

But, I can see interesting things peeking through, and it is quite possible I may raise my score if I get the chance to play more and better master the game.

In conclusion: Vlaada Chvatil is probably the closest analogue the boardgaming world has to a mad genius. Emphasis on the "mad".

Rating slightly increased again. I played a three-player competitive full game (no direct PvP, though) recently, and it was a lot of fun. With three players, downtime is manageable, although total playing time is still a big on the high side.
----------
Rating slightly lowered. I like a lot of things in the game, and have no objection to the puzzle-like nature of it, but length and downtime are problematic, and for the work and time spent, it feels like there's just too little "fun" for me: Turns spent crawling through the landscape to get anywhere interesting, the 'sameness' of every encounter, etc...

-------
Complexity is manageable, and the game is good fun, but it really is absurdly long! Two or three players seems to be best, four players drags the game out for far too long.
-------
At first glance a nice, well-designed adventure boardgame. Quite a lot of rules complexity though, so in the long term gameplay has to be really stellar to justify that (and I am still firmly in the camp of believing that adventure/exploration games are best handled on a computer).

Time will tell how fantastic the game is... First impression was pretty good, though. But man, the game is long: Even the beginner's game is almost an all-nighter.

RATING: 8.5
Love this game, though I doubt the calculations are ever going to come naturally to me. It's really amazing to think that this game of constant recalculation can give anyone a feeling of a fantasy adventure... but somehow it does. 

It's never going to be a go-to game for me because its amazingly difficult to get someone up to speed and playing the game, and because its a long slog through four hours of brain bending fun, but it'll always be something I want to play when I have the time.

Amazing adventure/deck builder/hand management game from Vlaada. Take the role of a mage knight and explore and conquer your way through the lands.

Unfortunately expansions are plagued with production issues (tokens not being the same size making it extremely obvious what enemies are coming up next, missing pieces, etc..) as well as availability problems.

Plays really well solo as well, sometimes I set it up play a turn or day/night cycle and then go do something else and come back to it. Looks really neat after a bit of exploring has happened and you've built yourself up a nice army.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (January 2012)

For me Vlaada is the game best game designer out there. He always deliver innovative ideas with great gameplay and lots of theme and this game is no exception. Mage Knight is a gem and one game I believe will continue to raise in my ratings.

The game is dripping with theme, and there is so much to do you will never get bored with the game, with so many options it could trigger analysis paralysis in some people, but I love the sheer amount of things to do :D.

I didn’t knew (until I played the game) that the core mechanic was Deck Building, however you don’t need to shuffle constantly which is my only complaint with Dominion. Unlike most deck building games, your initial cards are quite useful, the components are quite good except for the cards, you need to sleeve them ASAP or they will suffer pretty quick.

The game is a little heavy, with the rules and with the game length, it can easily consume 4 hours of your life and the rules could have been shorter and to the point. Perhaps my only concern is that it seems the player who gets the best couple of turns at the beginning  can be difficult, if not impossible, to stop. This could mean that the winner of the game can be decided within the first 20 minutes of the game but you still need to play hours after that to finish a game.

You need to try it before you buy it, but for me it is a must have. By far the best adventure/RPG game out there.

I still love the game and I think it is a great 2 player game. For now on, I refuse to play this with 3 or more players, the downtime is excessive. I’m also downgrading its rating to reflect my new feeling toward the game and to match the BGG rating system recommendations.

Mage Knight is a good game that I’m usually willing to play. I still want to buy it but my main issue is the excessive down time (not the play time).

I still think this is a good game, for now I don’t have any desire to buy it and my desire to play it went lower after the last play. Definitively, I will only play with two players. The downtime is killing this game for me. Now I feel the game takes a long time to play for what it offers.

RATING: 10
Mage Knight is good, possibly very good. Not sure if it's great yet but definitely good - the decks are small, starting at 16 cards each, and cards are added to the decks rather slowly so a deck might end up anywhere between 16-22 cards. I'm really impressed with how well the deckbuilding component works - Mage Knight in no way feels like "another deckbuilding game." There are enough different monsters, units, and spells to provide for a lot of interplay variety and some very fun and challenging decision space. It's not unlike Through the Ages in that the currencies in the game are all relatively straightforward and simple but interact in complex ways.

My concern so far is that it can be hard to do much planning on other players' turns. The board will have changed quite a bit and, significantly, the available mana will have changed. There is a common mana source available and each time players use a mana die they will reroll it at the end of their turn. So even though you see your hand for the entire turn it's impossible to know what mana will be available so forward planning is difficult.

I expect this issue to melt away with an experienced group who can streamline the planning process. So for now I'm giving Mage Knight the benefit of the doubt and rating it 8. I can see it ending up anywhere between 6 and 10 which is a pretty wide range for me after a first couple plays - but the most likely ratings are 8 and 9.

Edit after 5 plays:  much less AP with experienced players.  We actually finished a 3-player 4 round scenario in less than 2 hours.  I'm much happier knowing that 2-3 hours is a reasonable time frame for this title. 

Edit after 9 plays:  I'm settling on 9 as a tentative final rating for this title.  Most of my concerns have been alleviated and I'm finding that the majority of my plays are great mathy hack-and-slash fun.

My remaining concerns are:  first, that the game just isn't very fun in the one in five cases when either the odds or incompetence lead to my getting severely hosed.  I am finding that this happens less and less with experience, but there's still a small chance that any one play will be underwhelming.  Second, I'm finding I just don't care about the scoring.  [user=enzo622] has termed all the scoring categories a "point salad," the point being that they don't necessarily integrate well thematically.  I feel this shows up most in the majority bonuses - I simply don't care if I've conquered more towers than the other players, or learned more skills.  I care if I make conquests, because I get cool rewards, but the three points? Whatever.  I worry that if I get involved in a game with very competitive types, the points will overwhelm the adventure, and that would siphon away the fun.

These are quibbles though.  Mage Knight is an outstanding experience, and a pretty good game.

Edit after 15 multiplayer plays and 8 solo plays:  This is a 10 for me.  All of my concerns have been alleviated by repeated play.  I'm addicted to this game.

One play only, very enjoyable. Mix of deck building (sort of - you won't acquire new cards at the same rate as Dominion or even A Few Acres of Snow) and arithmetic puzzling in a fantasy, Tolkein-esque setting.

Played competitively, it's essentially a point-grab race - enemies may seem formidable but they're essentially a route to points and powerups, the challenge being how to gather the necessary cards and other resources to beat them as quickly as possible.

In some ways it may be best as a solo or 2 player game as there isn't a great deal of scope for player interaction and (due to the puzzley nature of the gameplay) turns can take a while.

This may make it seem less fun than I meant: I enjoyed it a lot as much as a series of mental challenges as a game. The theme's similar, but a dice-driven luck-fest from the Talisman mould it is not.

I played Dungeon Lords (by the same designer) and hated it except for the "puzzle-like" way that you defeat heroes in your dungeon.  I thought that was brilliant and should have been the whole game.  Now we have Mage Knight.  It's not quite the same as the mechanics in Dungeon Lords, but it's similar.  My impression after playing solo once is that this will most likely be one of my favorite games. There really is a lot to think about and many meaningful decisions on each turn.

This was a neat game.  It's a lot to take in with a fairly sizeable time commitment but I'd certainly recommend trying it.  

I give it a seven after one play.  My guess is that the rating would go up after more plays.

Enjoyable adventure game accentuated by nicely painted minis. The best thing about it is that you CAN pass the leader and it is anyone's game right to the end. Update: Just played the 2nd scenario and the game suffers from "Arkham Horror Syndrome" where they made it just too damn hard to win. Also, there's so many bits that the table is clogged with them - and I have a HUGE table. Downgraded rating from an 8.

RATING: 10
Rules - there are lots of them. I highly recommend anyone who is willing to try out this game to watch Ricky's Mage Knight Board Game runs. He explains set-ups, and your very first mission as well as conquest missions which is done so exceptionally well. But even then, there are a lot of small minor rules here and there that you might overlook but I don't believe it would be game breaking.

Even through my first mission, this game was amazing. Yes, I watched the tutorial videos to help me out, but that didn't take away any of the fun from me. With repeated plays and after I get the hang of the game to the point that where I don't have to consult the rule book for minor details (oh what does this icon mean? What can I do in Village again?), I can see this one shoot up in my score near 9. 

The puzzle aspect and deck building were brilliant. Trying to figure out how to approach each movement and fight is so well done. I can see that this might not appeal to many people for being so puzzle-like, but the fact that you can play your cards side-ways to gain any action increases the freedom so if you are one of those who hate puzzles, still give it a try. You will be surprised to find what is in this game.

Only downside to this game is the set up time. There are simply way too many components to play this game. Other than that, really nothing much to nit pick on. I got a nice Plano storage and set up time has been reduced dramatically. I just need to find a way to store my cards now.

RATING: 7
I can see this moving up or down depending on repeated plays.  As I currently think this is an 'experience' game, I think the co-op may go up to 9.  The PVP variant seems a bit random and may not be liked.  If the co-op plays as well as I hope it does, then it's a definite keeper.  The solo game is a great, great puzzle that I enjoy quite a bit!

It's a fantasy adventure Euro with some dice (sort of) but used in a proper Euro-y way.  They don't have pips!

And it's Vlaada Chvaatil and it's Wizkids.  Weird and shouldn't work, but it does.  Beware this game takes a long time to play. It's a beast, but mostly in a good way.

Mage Knight and Lord of the Rings LCG are my two go-to solo games. Both are very thematic and much fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Mage Knight is a most unlikely game. The magnitude of its ambition is staggering. The complexity of its rules is frightening. On the surface, its shamelessly maximalist collection of ideas and mechanics looks like it could have been designed by an overeager young wannabe who wanted to start off their career by creating their hypothetical kitchen sink dream game, plausibility be damned. It shouldn't work.

But it's a Vlaada game. It DOES work. It works amazingly well.

It's a hard game to get started with. Every session seems to present a fresh new set of edge cases and interpretations, and will inevitably have the players combing the rules, the FAQ and the BGG forums multiple times. But it's worth it. Slowly getting better at it, session by session, is rewarding like no other game I've played. If my first games began with crawling, a few games in I had built the confidence to take a few cautious steps, then walk, and now, after a couple of dozen sessions, I'm jogging and occasionally sprinting.

Rated 9 initially, upgraded to 10 during a summer spent obsessed with the game.

RATING: 6
While I love many of the concepts and design choices of Mage Knight, it ultimately proves too convoluted to be enjoyable for me. I really like that the game provides a rich, robust fantasy adventure board game that doesn't require one person to be an overlord/GM. The fact that all players experience the game equally and simultaneously is a huge plus. However, the blending of mechanics is clunky and sometimes counterintuitive. Mage Knight offers so much to do and explore, but the game becomes a victim of its own strength in spreading itself thin by trying to do too much. I find the hand management aspect more of a limiting factor than an opportunity for strategic planning. I have played it several times and kept wanting to like it more, but in the end it just feels too cumbersome.

Awesome game. I want to play this, but only solo. Unless you already play, I am out multiplayer. I hate to teach, but will play with people that already know the rules. Deep rich adventure, but you need to plan a day around it to get the most out of it.

This rating is after one game with three. A part of me wants to say that this game is just far too complicated for its own good. However, I had a lot of fun playing it and I could see how once you have the rules internalized it could be super fun with lots of re-playability. Steep learning curve, though. 

This might be the first game I've played that includes deck-building, but deck-building doesn't feel like the main mechanic of the game. Deck optimization is not very achievable here, it is much more about the board play. Refreshing to play a deck-builder that is not primarily about deck-building. Is this mechanic starting to mature?

RATING: 5
Truly I do not understand why this game is rated so highly.  It is a good game.  It is not a great game.  Like the designer's other big game, Through the Ages, it is just too long and too fiddly.  Mage Knight is very much a 'puzzle' game - you simply work out what your best combination of cards to play each turn.  Its much tactical.  Deckbuilding in a RPG theme is a good idea - this is just a mediocre implementation.  If you like Soduko then I guess you will like this.

RATING: 10
Impressive game, love the cards mechanic. A shame the rules are so detailed though. I really don't see the point of all the special combat rules for multiplayer and pvp... could have streamlined the game quite a bit.

edit: This game is so much fun!!! So many ways to play your turn due to the cards, it never gets dull!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It seems people enjoy this game as an "optimization puzzle", which means you don't do what you want, you do what will make the most things happen in the game based on what you draw.

This comes very naturally to me(optimizing limited resources), so it feels dead and lifeless solo, like the game is playing me.  Add other players and you have crippling down time.

The theme is that of characters that(in D&D terms) are Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, Lawful Evil, and Chaotic Evil.  There are no heroes--you burn monasteries, threaten villagers, and pillage.

RATING: 9
WOW! I was very wary about the hype, but my fears were all unfounded. This is an absolute blast! Some reviewers say that the game feels like multiple mini-games globed together awkwardly, and I must strongly disagree. The different aspects of the game (deck building, resource management, board movement, etc.) are actually very cleverly integrated to each other. Only the various day/night tactics cards feel a little tacked on, but they are overall fine and solve the problem of avoiding rigid turn orders in a clever and interesting way. I can't wait to try all the expansions to this game!

Cult of the new garbage that will fall in the ranks...I promise.  People claim it is deep and complex.  Sorry, not deep and not complex.  I actually think this game lacks depth and complexity.  The choices are obvious, the character upgrades are minimal, and for three hours of torture the return just isn't there.  Arbitrary rules don't make a game deep or complex they just make it convoluted.  

It doesn't help that the fan boys of this game are complete horses asses that swarm to blindly defend their demigod.

RATING: 10
This is a rules heavy game! There are tons of icons and special rules for different locations, battling different enemies, coop vs. competitive vs. PvP, scenarios, etc... It can be intimidating. At its core it is a pretty simple game of hand management, action efficiency, and risk management. It presents you with puzzles each turn much like Dungeon Lords and Dungeon Petz do. How to optimize spending your current hand can be a punishing exercise and if you don't like the sound of that you will certainly hate this game.

The theme is extremely strong, and the slow deckbuilding and levelling up is implemented beautifully. You really feel like you're becoming more powerful over the course of the game. There are tons of units, advanced actions, artefacts, and spells so repeated plays will result in substantially different character builds. If you do eventually explore all of the cards in the base game the first expansion adds lots more to the mix.

I play this exclusively as a coop game, the first expansion helps add more variety to that experience. I also play with a rules expert which makes my life a lot easier. I'm not sure if I would have wanted to invest the time and energy to grok the rule-set on my own.

I really enjoy the game, it has an epic feel and presents you with truly agonizing decisions. However, there is quite a bit of luck in the game which can sometimes detract from the fun. Certain terrain configurations can be crippling, drawing the wrong hand of cards can result in horribly inefficient turns, rolling the wrong results on the magic source dice or drawing the wrong enemy (not all enemies are drawn randomly, but some are) can be devastating. Some of this is risk management and some is just bad luck.

There is a lot of game here. Looking forward to exploring more.

Is surprisingly good as a solo game, especially to learn the system. Becomes much more intuitive after a couple of plays. Looking forward to getting 3 player games in.

Too long with 4, 2 or 3 is good though. This game is consuming and getting better with every play.

Full conquest with players who are familiar with the game is definitely the way to play... Expansion please!

Full conquest takes about 3 players, but you have to be selective with who you play with!

2- I've gotten a few more plays under my belt and finally feel good about rating the game.  This game is excellent.  Easily the best game I own. The only reason I could not put 10 was that I can never find anyone to play it with.  Even Solo I enjoy it more than anything I own. I asked for the expansion for my birthday coming up cant wait for some new stuff.

Take this with a grain of salt since i only played the Solo campaign once and failed horrifically.  There is so much to keep track of on your first play through. I did a few assaults and screwed up one big one where i forgot a Mage Tower was fortified.  Got really unlucky with my first few tiles and was quickly over my head.  Cant wait to try again tomorrow.

Hardcore Euro strategy game with enough fantasy flavour to satisfy Ameritrashers. Difficult to judge after one solo game but I hope that the game gets more fluent with some experience.

Lots of replayability but potentially a bit too heavy and procedural for my liking. As usual, Chvatil has a great rules concept to make learning this game comparably easy for its weight.

This game is clever -- there's a lot going on. But the pacing doesn't feel right for what I want from a deck-building game. Mage Knight feels more like an RPG with a side of deck-building stuck on. In general, I don't feel that theer's enough control over what one's character can do/become, and so the game is more reactive than creative.

It's not a bad game if you like what is -- it's just that I don't.

A very well done, engrossing game. However, the solo game has gotten stale for me and the competitive game, while much more interesting than the solo game, is a bit too luck based given the length, and the luck elements add more frustration than fun.

As much as I love playing games with others, playing MK solo is about as sweet a board gaming experience that exists on this plane of reality. The ultimate puzzle adventure, MK will challenge you from start to finish playing somewhere in the 3-4 hour neighborhood for me for solo conquest and 2-3 hours playing either Volkare scenario. For the solo gamer, Lost Legion is basically a must buy.

I've always been a big fan of the RPG. There's just something about taking a character and leveling them up, gaining new abilities, and tackling harder and harder enemies that has always appealed to me. This game has that in spades and with a plethora of options for you to do so. It's a game that when you first play it will seem nigh impossible to complete. After repeated play though you will begin to really see the possibilities of what you can achieve in 3 days and 3 nights and that reward keeps me coming back again and again.

[b]First Impressions:[/b] I played the First Reconnoissance solo. I did a lot of research before playing, but I'm sure I missed a lot of rules and messed up a lot of things. Still, I had fun, which is saying something, because solo game experiences have always been very dull for me. There is an interesting balance between strategy, tactics, randomness, and luck. It may take a few plays and rule studies before I feel confident I've played it right, but so far, this game looks like an absolute gem.

After an additional play, I can't pull myself to play this at [i]any[/i] time, because of the scale of the time. But it still is one of the best games out there.

I would probably liken this to an RPG version of Dungeon Lords. I don't think its any more complex, but there are a lot of moving parts (small fiddly rules) that make the game seem more complicated than it is. If you've ever played DL, imagine that you're playing the Hero phase (where they try to sanctify your dungeon) over and over again. Thats what each turn of this game is. You need to puzzle out what the best way of using your cards are each turn.

The rulebooks (both) are horribly written, seemingly designed to obfuscate the rules. The longwinded explanations attempt to describing the game instead of just listing the points. I have never had a rulebook show a picture of a card with an arrow saying "You should already know what this number means". WTF!?

So heavy...so very very heavy...but tons of fun.  This doesn't see the table very often due to its ungainly heaving mass of a weight rating but when it does manage to hit the table it typically makes for HOURS of fun tactical and strategic choices...often spread out over the course of a weekend because I take my sweet time.

I love a good story, which Mage Knight the Board Game provides, but what really has me hooked on this game is the puzzle aspect.  How do I use my cards most efficiently?  What will I lose out on if I play Stamina sideways for influence this turn?  Outstanding.

Fantastic puzzle in a box. Unfortunately, it takes about 2 hours per person to play and it is very brain intensive so not all my friends enjoy it.. But I love it!! I've spent countless hours making sure I understood how to play so I don't screw up the rules (which is very easily done). My friend and I will dedicate a whole day just to play this game.

I find this game very interesting and it reminds me of deck building with some elements of RuneBound (or is it the other way around?).
The game seems a good balance between skill and luck, but sometimes the game justgives you very much unfair hands.

The design on this game is more complex and more immersive than any other game I've played.  I'm a big fan of complex games so this is one of my favorites.  Here is a small list of what I enjoy about it: beautiful compenents including nicely pre-painted miniatures, modular board, interesting combat mechanics, remarkable flexibility of how to play any given hand, diversity of board game elements (terrain, buildings, monsters).  I am not a solo gamer but this is the one game I will continue to play solo.  I find it too difficult to win with the dummy player as specified in the rules but the beauty of the game is you can change the difficulty in a number of ways.  I prefer to add one additional round after the dummy is out of cards.  A mild criticism of the game is that cooperative play does feel like solitaire.  In a two player game you have to split up in order to cover enough space and therefore there is little possibility of cooperating on battles.  I have yet to play with more than 2 or in a competitive game and am looking forward to that.  Vlaada Chvatil, you are brilliant.  

Update: dropped from 9 to 7.5 after 4th play.  Rating is lowered because of complexity and gameplay time.   I often look at the game and don't want to suggest it for play because I'm tired of having to look up and/or explain rules and gameplay can absolutely drag with players trying to decide how to play their cards.

RATING: 10
An amazing game. Somewhat tiring so be sure to have enough energy. Every turn is a puzzle, how to play your hand as best as you can. Perhaps get rid of a few cards you don't need and save the rest for the next turn? Should you explore a new tile and see what lies beyond or stay here and claim what you can?

The game is full of choices, every step is a choice. It's amazing. It's incredibly thematic and beautiful. At times (later, when you get a bigger army) it almost reminded me of Heroes of Might and Magic.

If you think you'll like it you definitely will. Can't wait to get the expansion and add even more content.

RATING: 4
This is probably very cleverly designed and a fine representative of its kind, but the introductory scenario felt like a lot of granular build-up to an arbitrary cut-off point. Some of the time your draws will simply be bad, as you sit with cards that do combat or recruitment or temporary resource acquisition, but no way to go where they'd be useful: it's not "what's my best course of action given this selection" as much as "what do I sacrifice in an attempt to scramble out of this hole while the others zip by". Add lack of player interaction and this could be a problem. Thankfully, this is not a deckbuilding game. I assume there are scenarios where objectives are more structured and high-end acquisitions have more of an impact on the game - but then what kind of playing time are you looking at?

Playing the standard game mostly confirmed my impressions. It's a design swarming with options and currencies, but it's also a flavourless five-hour snowball heading towards something I don't particularly come to care about.

RATING: 8
This game is likely to rise higher still since I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

The game comes with a very good introductory scenario that does a good job of holding your hand. Oh, you'll still be forgetting about all your options all the time. But that's ok. The game doesn't mind :p

Mage Knight is an exploration game where you play as the titular Mage Knights and... are pretty much so powerful you're a one-man 4x game O_o

The game's expensive to get into (it cost me 105 euros for everything and I'd consider that a bargain) but it does deliver. The only thing that's not as fantastic is the prepainted minis. They're useable but I can see you wanting to paint your own version. Especially for the latest one, Braevelar (which is weird since the mini before that, Krang, was probably the best one so far).

Oh, and of course it takes ages to play (though not as bad as you'd fear/expect) and hogs all of the table space...

But for a game like this? I honestly don't mind.

RATING: 6.5
2015-02-13 - I rate games after first play but I wasn't able to rate MK that way. After the second game it's an 8. It's quite demanding game, but I think that after few more plays I won't be such overwhelmed and the rating might be even higher.

2015-02-22 - 8->9 after two games using the first scenario I can't wait to play bigger and longer ones.

2015-12-27 - 9->6,5 - That's a big drop. I wanted to give it 7 at first but I followed the description of the BGG ratings and "if in the right mood" is the key here. This game has a huge flaw to me - sometimes it's just painful to play and really tiring, but not in a good satisfying way. If there are hard tiles drawn at the beggining and you have no movemement cards, you just need to waste what you have in hand. Sometimes two turns in a row. 
This game can be very interesting and very rewarding puzzle, but sometimes it's just laborious and you want to end it immediately, but you don't, because you spent 15 minutes on setup after postponing playing it 4 times before.
Anyway I like to play it solo from time to time.

2016-02-14 - I didn't play solo since last play and most probably I will not play it ever again. I'll try to sell or trade this game. I'm glad I tried it, I had some fun (sometimes not), but it's enough.

I told a friend of mine, this feels like Diablo 2 put into a board game.  Really fun and surprising amount of depth for replay, both in the adventuring and the customization of the character you play.  Really good RPG mechanics built into it.  A little thicker in the rules, but if that improves a game for you, you really need to check this out.

Odd for me, but its a Vlaada game that I didn't enjoy. Three plus hours of doing almost nothing of interest. It was a 4 player game, so plenty of chance for competition, but the interaction was basically as much as you would have in any race game. First person to arrive at a point gets to do something. The sum total of my game was actually revealing a couple of tiles. 

Traded away after one game.

So close to being an awesome game, yet is let down by bloated mechanics and fiddliness that absolutely kills any immersion. It feels like the designer crammed in as many rules (usu. governed by oversized cards) for every little nuance he could, even for simple things like player turn order.

Pros
- The Map tiles are gorgeous, (and are just begging me to redesign my own game around them)
- The different locations, random tokens guarding those locations, and choices available to a player each turn at those locations is well implemented and perfectly suited to a fantasy adventure game.
- Some of the other mechanics are also highly innovative (e.g. drawing mana from 'the source' and having different creative options for how to store or wield it)

Cons
- You will need a massive play area for even a solo game.
- Although I believe deck-building could work in a fantasy RPG, I feel it has been poorly executed in this game, with Actions, Spells, and Artifacts all having similar functions, making extraneous elements, like Units and Skills, feel tacked on.
- There are cards all over the place! These are bigger than they need to be, and unless you are impeccably well-organised and have plenty of table space, you will soon find stray cards merging with the wrong piles, (especially since your deck is mix-and-matched with all kinds)
- I suspect the down-time would drive players crazy in anything above a 2-player game, while in a one-player game you're essentially racing against the clock.
- Although there are many decks, there aren't many cards in each (usu. around 20). And since many function very similarly, you will quickly cycle through everything the game has to offer in a couple plays.

However, despite this mainly negative review, I do believe creative players could do a lot with the game components (minus the unwieldy cards). Bring in a few 'character sheets' and various ability scores, item 'tokens', etc, and you just might be able to create that board game RPG you've been waiting for someone else to design for you.

Update after playing a two-player scenario and getting stronger units, higher levels, etc...  A lot of fun in this game.  When you get stronger, with more units, spells, advanced cards, etc... the game becomes much more interesting.  There is a learning curve to this game, but it seems to be worth the effort.

Initial rating based on solitaire play of learning scenario.  

This is an interesting mash up of fantasy hero adventuring and deck builder.  There are a lot of decisions to make and a fairly steep learning curve. The rules come with a built-in learning scenario and set-up guide to ease the learning of the mechanics, but it's the game-play that will take some time to learn to play well.  It's a challenging game, but given the genre, I'm not sure it's worth the extra effort over something like Runebound or Arkham Horror.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
A significant learning curve, but a real gem of a game. The almost rpg flavor - it reminds me of NES "Dragon Warrior" - for leveling and board interaction is something I find endearing. The mechanics of deck management are excellent. I find it works well with any number of players, including the solo game, which speaks of the quality of the game design. These games run long!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Only recommended for 1 and 2 players, but in this regard one of the best experiences for gamers that enjoyed Diablo, Baldur's Gate and other great RPG experiences.

Mage Knight can stall a bit with the 10th game, as it's always about cities, but the different spells and units in combination with the main character enable good replayability.

Negative: too mathy fights.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The core system has some real fun in it - but the game system is horrible to learn, with a bunch of monster effects that aren't easy to remember (wait, I need fire block to block ice effectively, but monsters need ice to block ice, and then my troops can get either ice block or ice resistance, both of which do different things - and that's without mentioning the totally unmemorable icons for other monster abilities), similar but different places on the board without an apparent reason to include them all, attack can be pooled but block can't, you can hire units anywhere except for some reason not in cities, etc etc. Basically, everything has an exception and everything is fiddly, but most of the fiddly rules add nothing to the game.

Add on that combat is completely deterministic, that the mana effects (which I like the concept of) mean there are a myriad of ways to play any particular hand, and that in typical Vlaada style you are punished out of all proportion for minor mistakes (miscalculated your block by one? take full damage), and you have a recipe for extremely long turns as players have to work out how to precisely optimise their hand for the desired result. As there's nothing to do when it isn't your turn, downtime can sometimes be extreme.

There's also a great deal of randomness in the map tiles you explore (both in terms of ease of travel and the locations present), the monsters you encounter, the spells/skills/units available when it's your chance to take one and so forth, and the order your cards come up (with only 3-5 shuffles in most scenarios) - and I can't really convince myself that player skill has a great deal to do with the outcome. With the same character, a similar scenario, and similar tactics, on one occasion I came first, and on the other dead last. As far as I can tell, it's because the first time round I got an outrageously powerful spell that would just destroy dragons outright, while in the second game someone else did and I got a lacklustre healing spell.

But for all the grumbling above, the core game system is good, and I there is a lot of fun to be had with Mage Knights. It's just necessarily mixed in with sometimes unreasonable frustration at the game system, takes far too long to play and I'm not sure I'm willing to put up with that in a game which just takes me along for the ride, rather than letting me play it.

I parted with this game in the past but need to re-acquire it.  It's a hard game to get back into because the rules are dense but it came closest to replacing Magic Realm in my mind and there really isn't a better option out there that I am aware of.  Maybe I should start playing games like this solo, if only to keep the rules fresher in my mind so I'm more ready to play it when the opportunity arises.

Mage Knight Board Game: The Lost Legion (English first edition) (2012)

Fiddly, fiddly rules in an excellent adventure game. Be sure you check your components when you un-box your game, because my game had some missing pieces. You get a one time free replacement parts order from Wiz-Kids, which was hardly any hassle at all. There are so many things I like about MK: variable player powers, modular board, solitaire play, strong theme integration, and amazing components. The game rules are not that complex, but they are fiddly (there is a lot of stuff here, and everything has its own way of being dealt with) and sometimes difficult to find. I have to dock it full point for its fiddliness, simply because it makes it extremely difficult to get to the table.

RATING: 3
Before I bought this game I thought this will be an adventurous + deck building game. But after a few plays, it kind of fell off for me as my moves on the tile were very limited by the cards that I have, and I hardly can get some advanced, spell , advance units and treasure cards and use them under the maximum of 6 rounds (3 days and 3 nights). 

After reading some reviews and comments in the forum, I finally realize that this game is basically a puzzle game. It is highly depend on how you choose your actions and maximize the effect and usage of the cards in your hand. You probably need to spend 5-10 minutes to decide how you gonna play the 5 cards in your hand, which I don't like it at all. 


People that like puzzle solving might love this game. But I would prefer an adventurous game that is not tightly restricted by the the way to play the cards on my hand, and this game is no where near any deck building game like dominion, ascension, etc. Also, it take a long time to learn and setup this game. 
 
Maybe I need to play it more in order to grab the essence or fun of this game, but after less than 10 solo play, I don't even feel like touching it at all. As a result, I've sold the game and I'm glad I did it. I think this game is overrated.

Mage Knight is an extremely heavy game and difficult to learn but worth the effort.  Part exploration, part deck-building, it is loaded with cool mechanics and beautiful artwork.  Analysis paralysis can be an issue as it requires number crunching which tends to extend playing time, but it has amazing replayability.  There is also an issue with some card balance but this has been addressed somewhat in the Lost Legion expansion.  Best with 2 players because it is long (3 hours+)

Not my cup of tee. I do not even know where to start. Too long, not intuitive, too restrictive, ugly, too large to setup. The worst thing gameplay wise is probably fact, that you have to use cards to move on the board and if you do not draw them... Deck building here is also weird, as you will reshuffle the deck only several times. I tried this maybe three times and it got me bored, always. IMO one of the most overhyped games by geeks, casual gamer would never touch this and a lot of geeks also.

This game is amazing as a solo game which is one of the main reasons I picked it up.  It stays engaging throughout and is a great challenge.  Doesnt feel overly large although the rules are complex its manageable and worth the investment.

This is an excellent solo game, and a decent co-op game.  Played competitively though the game is not fun or worth the time.  The game has a horrible run-away victor effect where the cards you gain from early successes make it easy for you to get then more successes even faster and as a result it is almost always obvious who the victor will be 2 hours before the game is over because it is impossible for any other player to catch up with the player who has had the more lucky early hands.

In co-op, this can be offset since the players are working together, but in competitive it makes the majority of the game's play time pointless.

I haven't really gotten to play this game too much yet (only 4 plays, 3 of them being the first scenario and the other being the solo conquest). With that said, I haven't dived too deeply into the game yet but after a few more two player games (playing something other than the intro scenario) I believe this game has far more potential to go up in score rather than down. 

Thus far I must say I am not sure how I feel about the game's huge reliance on cards and hand management but I am warming up to it more and more with each play through. Personally, I feel the complexity of the game has been talked up a bit. Yes, there are A LOT of rules...but they are all pretty much self contained and just require and quick reference back to the rules.

It's a good game that gives you sense of accomplishment. You start as a kid with a rusty dagger and end up as a dragon-slayer-super-hero!

The problem with the game is that it is super complicated (even for gamers) and takes FOREVER to play (especially with gamers). 

Would only play this in very rare circumstances with a very special set of people that take their turns quickly. And this does not happen a lot (probably never).

works better as a co-op than as PvP.

the design is pure GENIUS. I could not imagine a solo playing game would be so much fun. It combines puzzle, card management, adventure and a sense of rpg-like achievement. It makes me want to write down my session and create a story, and this is for me the trademark of having fun with a game.

Gave it away. The solo experience got much less exciting soon and it just takes too long for a solo. If I have 4 hours available, I better use them to go play with other people.

Tentative rating, based on one play. Will rate again based on two to three additional plays.

Lots of theme, lots of working parts. Not sure if it all hangs together quite as well as it needs to - most things are intuitive but others are less so, so finding the proper "rhythm" is difficult.

Still remarkable for what it's trying to achieve - an epic RPG experience in a box, with a 3-4 hour playing time.

I can appreciate the clever design. To use deck building as a replacement randomiser of a dice is a moment of brilliance. But I find the game cumbersome. Achieving everything is slow work - especially in comparison a dice rolling RPG.

What a brilliant game. The whole game is really a puzzle, even if you don't draw the cards you need you can always do something, there is never a time when you are really stuck for something to do, unless you have a handful of wounds of course! Then there is still a way to get rid of these and carry on, it just slows you right down. Not totally co-op, but the end goal for the players is the same, before that you are really doing your own thing. What a buzz when you use all your cards to pull off a move and defeat that Dragon with swiftness and poison without taking a wound!

A really great Boardgame. There is so much to do, the Deckbulding is great, the difference in cards is fun and you have the feeling that you conquer a country with your knight, absolutely great.

Insanely high barrier to entry prevents a higher score.  If you're willing to learn and dig your teeth in, you'll get a great experience.

Mage Knight is a great game, but it is a bit too complicated for me to play it often.  Also, though some may enjoy the different modes of play, I find that I wish for a more directed set of instructions.  Breaking the rules into 2 books was probably a bad idea, as it is difficult to remember what is located where.  

The game components are great, although the box insert is less than useless.  

I find I enjoy it more as a solo adventure than as a group game, though.

Rule heavy and very complex.  The game comes with both a rule book and a walkthrough that takes you turn by turn through what goes on in a few rounds.  The game needs it because there's a lot to learn.  It's a fairly fun game to play solo and fun to play with others if you can find friends that are willing to tackle the learning curve.  Adding more players makes the game run longer.

update:  dropped the rating to 5.  It doesn't get much player because it takes too much time to explain the rules.  There are little things to remember with huge consequences so it has to be re-learned every time it's pulled out.

It's easier to teach a friend D&D 3.5 than it is to teach this game!

Fun game, probably too complex for what it is - a smash & grab adventure game.  The endless card combos and inability to plan for one's turn while others are playing are a big drawback and really causes the game to drag in later rounds.

Truly a masterpiece for any fantasy and or strategy nerd. I'd recommend playing 2 player co-op or 2v2 without pvp. The PvP element is easily abusable and much too punishing.

The game is sooo great, but takes sooooo much time. I and my flatmate often play 1 char together to speed up the thought process and generate different ideas to min-max each turn. Still, it took us roughly 2 hours to complete a Full Conquest, but I must say that it was time well-spent. I realize I don't enjoy playing solo (and other solo/co-op games in general) really much.

RATING: 10
A brilliant puzzle-style game that makes you consider your entire deck (cards you've played already, have in hand, and are yet to come) every single turn while figuring out how to optimize every hand.  The game is very, very hard to win and the changing map every game along with 4 different heroes (1 more in the expansion) and a large quantity of enemies, advanced action cards (better abilities of similar cards in your deck), and spells means no two games will be alike.  Fun solo or up to 3 players (4 in the expansion).  If you want a very serious gaming challenge after playing lighter games, this is a great choice.  If you love very difficult games that require extremely deep thinking and strategizing, this is the holy grail.

The Mage Knight board game puts you in control of one of four powerful Mage Knights as you explore (and conquer) a corner of the Mage Knight universe under the control of the Atlantean Empire. Build your army, fill your deck with powerful spells and actions, explore caves and dungeons, and eventually conquer powerful cities controlled by this once-great faction! In competitive scenarios, opposing players may be powerful allies, but only one will be able to claim the land as their own. In coöperative scenarios, the players win or lose as a group. Solo rules are also included.Combining elements of RPGs, deckbuilding, and traditional board games the Mage Knight board game captures the rich history of the Mage Knight universe in a self-contained gaming experience.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Great components: pre-painted miniatures, great artworks (with very few exceptions), engraved custom dice, high amount of cards and cardboard/plastic tokens, helpful summary cards.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Great replay value: randomised modular board, 4 different characters which all play quite differently because of their unique skills, many different scenarios, playable as a solitaire, cooperative and competitive game, optional rules.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Great solitaire game experience: the dummy player is very streamlined and easy to handle and serves as a challenging ticking clock. While the exact total amount of rounds is unknown, the end of a single round can still be foreseen.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Custom-made inlay: while I have heard that some people hate the inlay, I think it's great for sorting all the different components in a compact way.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] In my opinion unplayable with more than 2 players: the playtime is already relatively long with 1-2 players, but the real problem with 3-4 players is the painfully long downtimes.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] The rulebooks are well-structured and they do indeed work in teaching the rules: the wording is clear and precise to leave no room for interpretation. The problem is the presentation, as both rulebooks are written in small font size and the full rulebook presents the reader just pages with walls of text. Sadly, an index is also missing.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] The game demands a true time commitment from the player(s): 1. learning the rules, 2. setting up the game, 3. playing the game and 4. mastering the game, as you will be very slow and bad at this game in the beginning.


[b]Mage Knight[/b] is quite different in many ways, and it took me quite some time (5 full games) to actually figure out if I like this game or not, which is quite unusual.

The ambition, different options on each turn, strategic depth, component quality and theme of this game are great and I should actually love this game for these aspects, because it features a lot of elements that I like in board games.

The replay value is also very high: the possibility to play this game in three different ways (solo, cooperative, competitive) and in various different scenarios on a modular board with different characters is just amazing. The solo variant is very enjoyable and almost gives me the impression that the game was actually purposely designed as a solitaire game. It also seems that this game was heavily influeced by the [b]Heroes of Might & Magic[/b] video game series. Character growth feels amazing in this game: it happens slowly, but the milestones of leveling up are really impactful, meaningful and unique, thus really satisfying.

While this all sounds wonderful, here are my personal problems with this game:

The rules are unnecessarily complicated and full of details and exceptions. The combat system feels surprisingly unthematic and does not really seem like combat, as it boils down to (simple) calculations and the impression of doing taxes -- which is something most players will not expect at first when thinking of "combat". While the whole game is relatively complicated, the combat system is by far the most complicated part of the entire game.

Another con is, that the game practically unplayable with more than 2 players, because downtimes will reach painful lengths, especially if players are not very familiar with the game. The cooperative option is great, but there is no real interaction between players besides following a common plan together.

And while the game is often praised for being very puzzley and having a relatively low amount of luck, the game does indeed have a certain amount of luck which can at times hurt players quite badly. The first drawn land tiles and enemy tokens can have a surprisingly big impact on the beginning of the game. There's also of course the luck factor of the random card drawn, meaning that your hand sometimes tells you what you should do in order to have an efficient turn, instead of allowing you to do what you actually wanted to do.

I can see why this game is so popular (currently ranked #9 of all board games here on BGG), but in the end, the problems I am having with this game sadly do harm the fun for me. This game could be much better if some serious streamlining would have happened to this raw diamond, polishing off its rough edges while keeping its rich depth intact. Games can be complex, but they should not be complicated.

[b]Mage Knight[/b] is often described as an "adventure" game, which is really inaccurate in my opinion, since players are not doing quests/missions like in other adventure games: there are no storytelling aspects and going on "adventures" in [b]Mage Knight[/b] usually boils down to more combat or (more rarely) just paying a certain amount of resources at a certain location.

Overall, I would described this game as a sandboxy skirmish game with roleplaying elements (leveling up, skills), since it is very combat-centric and gives players a lot of freedom. Instead of calling it an "adventure" game, I would actually rather categorise it as a "racing game", since players are really under time pressure to travel and explore the land while leveling up as fast as possible through combat, since every new level is very impactful.

As I mentioned earlier, I took me quite a while to figure out if I like this game or not -- and by now, I can say that it is an aquired taste to me, after I understood the game's rhythm, that it's not an adventure game and that "combat" is something quite different here.

:arrowE: The definitive board game for adventurous puzzle solvers and book keepers. Definitely not a game for everyone and I can absolutely understand strong opinions in both directions.

[2016.Jun.20] An adventure game with some interesting elements and lots & lots of bells-and-whistles thrown into it. The game felt like it should have been a cooperative game from the start; gamers don't need yet another multi-player solo game. Others have discussed card-related issues, including lack of in-game mobility (due to too few movement points, for example), and runaway leader issues, which are certainly both present in this offering. While the game does have some interesting concepts, it feels quite under developed. I'm glad that I have had an opportunity to play it, but I'm also glad that I don't own it.

First of all. It's a superb game. It looks stunning, the miniatures are neat and I like a lot of the gameplay itself. But boy.. does it that long with 3+ players. And it's more or less a pure solitaire game (if you're not playing the mean variant). I just wanted it to end after 4 hours and had to stand up and leave because it would have been another 2 hours. For singleplayer it must be a blast. If I would be into solitaire.. this would have been a lot higher.. maybe 8/10.

No game has surprised me more.  I'm generally not strongly attracted to fantasy/dungeon crawl games, but this one really works for a variety of reasons.  First, the deck-building mechanic is simply brilliant, providing only a handful of opportutnities to acquire new cards, but nevertheless providing enough variation in those cards to pursue alterantive paths to victory.  Second, the card play system is punishing but still very fun, forcing players to analyze board opportunities to get the maximum value out of each hand, even very poor ones.  Finally, the game creates fabulous opportunities for risk/reward analysis by making the precise difficulty of each encounter unkown but within a known range of possibilities.  I knew this game would work for me in my very first play when I was faced with the choice of taking on an encounter that I had a high probability of winning with minimal damage for a modest reward and one with a low probability of winning without severe damage for a large reward.  These are just the sorts of decisions that I relish in games, and Mage Knight delivers them on a consistent basis.

RATING: 9
Like most Vlaada games, you pay a price for thematic design with mitigated RNG in very heavy rules with many special cases and exceptions. The rulebook is poorly designed and organized, which exacerbates this. However, there is simply no better 4X game out there. Not only is this the best 4X tabletop game, but the RPG design is possibly the best I've seen as well - the feeling of progression as you level up, select abilities, and customize your deck is extremely rewarding.

My biggest complaints are that RNG plays a large role in the game in the form of exploration of tiles and spawning of random monsters. The game also suffers from snowballing. I have only played three times, though, so I want to get a few more games in before I decide if these problems are truly deal-breakers.

1/2014: It's a little time consuming and *definitely* not for novice gamers, but boy... this is a good one. It feels like piloting a fighter---super complicated and finicky but boy what a thrill. A real treat.

1/2015: This remains a real treat if you have the time to get into it. I cannot imagine playing it with more than three, however. I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface.

Played twice, 4p, intro game; 3p, blitz.  Disappointing for a couple of reasons.  I expected to be more in control of my destiny.  But in both games, I felt behind everybody else, and I think that will be common; get a bit behind, and you must waste time to catch up and get ahead (not in points so much, but position).  In both games, some players simply waited while the leaders took actions that were essentially "win more".  And the game is incredibly fiddly; exceptions on top of exceptions, and more bits and cards than Arkham Horror.  I really can't see ever playing this game again, actually.  It occurred to me after my last game that it is entirely possible that it could take a dozen games to fully understand all the rules.  I just don't have the interest or the patience for that.  It is a good take on the adventure, character advancement genera.

At first it was overwhelming. But after a couple of plays and the help from a friend it just clicked. I some times leave it on the table and play a round here and there. But you need the Lost Legion expansion. That is a must. Also notice that there are short scenarios in the latest expansion that can be downloaded for free.

I see it as a cross between Runewars & Runebound.  Compared to Runewars, it's a bit simpler in scope (control a single hero, less side objectives), more narative (tells a story), a bit more luck based (which tile you pull, what monsters appear near you, how they matches your current hand if used for combat), while still being way more euro & smart than things like Runebound, Touch of Evil and the like (Talisman and Arabian nights being at the far end of that spectrum). I'd say it's even a bit deeper than Prophecy, which is pretty good for a game of this genre. There's lots of rules but it isn't too bad. Combat, blocking & damage mitigation is messy but it can be explained. The hex map & exploration gives this a small edge over Prophecy, and the solid mechanics gives this a clear edge over Return of Heroes and stuff like that.  Not a short game, but none in the genre really are...

I read the rules

Seems like an interesting deck building adventuring game. Might not buy it but would like to try it.

Read some comments, most bad stuff is that the downtime and complexity of the game makes it only good as a solitaire game. Not really a problem for me.

But people also said that there is a lack of surprise and randomness. Which makes it some sort of euro adventure game.

The card quality is also pretty cheap for a game that much expensive.

I guess I'll have to play first before getting this for trade.

After a video review:

The deck building aspect seems to be more of a side mechanics. There seems to be a cooalition of various types of mechanics rather than be focused mainly on deck building.

Apparently it is not as fun as solitaire as it could be. Sure there is a lot of neat components in this which explains the price of the game.

I guess I'll have to play first, if I can. Else there could be interesting ideas for one of my game.

Very interesting card driven game in which you just slightly build your deck which is used each day and night.  Level up your character, hire sidekicks, learn magic spells, use mana, etc and take down castles, monsters, and towers.  Lots of exploring to do and you can always use your card as a wild 1 of most action selections so to speak.

Now this is the fantasy game of my dreams. Deep, deep gameplay that really reveals itself over multiple plays, interesting objectives that require long term, and short term planning. An upgrade system that is second to none. All wrapped into a really really intuitive game system that is both rewarding and unique. 

[u]Updated Comments:[/u]
I lied, this wasn't the fantasy game of my dreams. After awhile it just seemed to be game made for schlogging through and not much ever really happens that makes the game all that exciting. Yes it is a nice developmental tree, and yes the deckbuilding is well integrated into the game, but really overall the game just neds up being rather boring. This could be because I mostly ever played this as a solo game, but they only thing I can imagine the multiplayer to be that the solo is not is even more boring. Thanks, but I'll pass on this one.

I like the game a lot in theory. There are lots of interessting mechanics, lots of stuff is going on, endless possibilities. But I happen to never have fun when playing it.
The downtimes between your own turns are endless. I also never can see a motivating long term goal. It's just going around looking what encounter you can possible reach and beat with the cards you have at that time. Very often you only have one of the two things you need - walk endlessly without the ability to beat someting, or do endless damage but not beeing able to get to a monster before that. So all you do in a lot of turns, is prepare a little bit, hoping for the right card, hoping for the right dice and then BAM, an other player comes and kills the monster you were aming at and again you have to look for something doable. There's no tension, no goal, no route I can plan and try to follow.
There is no "I'd like to do that and I'm working to accomplish it"... it's more like "am I able to do anything from where I am with the cards I just drew?".

With every play I like the game little bit less. It takes forever, which is normally a think I like. But in this case all it does is add even more waiting time, so from an 8-10 hours session I sit around bored at least half of the time.

This is perhaps the best game in the "level up your hero and bash monsters" pseduo-RPG genre that I have played. That said, it is not a genre that I particularly favor.  I like how the mana system works and feel that the wounds blend nicely with the deckbuilding elements.  A very good game, indeed an outstanding game of its type, that stands on the shoulders of games that have come before.

I mean. If you want to play alone, this is the PERFECT game experience.

There is only that problem when you are alone and roll 3 nights out of the 3 first rolls of the third day, look around to see if anyone is watching and re-roll them. It's true that later you may be ashamed of yourself, but we all do it and we know it.

Aside from that, this IS the BEST GAME I've ever played!

I'm not alone in thinking this is one of the greatest board games of all-time, and undisputedly the best solo experience, with Eldritch Horror a close second. Out of my 430+ game collection, this might be only one of two that I will look forward to playing on a day off of work while I'm home alone, with as much anticipation and enjoyment as any great soloable video game. And the experience only improves with another player. 

This game might score lower on my Top 10 List due to 2 weaknesses: (1) The game lags badly with more than 3 people, and plays best with merely two players. (2) I would prefer more randomness in combat to allow for risk-taking.

Quite a number of nice features are combined here. Essentially a Magic Realm light wargame! Gameplay is smooth. But the purely card-determined, diceless combat results left us lame.  We played the training recon scenario only though.  Perhaps I would have a complete different view with more advanced scenarios and solitaire play.  After all, I had fun with the game knocking down two giant monsters and won the game.

1st play - not a clue, I played a cooperative game with a more experienced guy, he helped me on my moves and still I found it too complicated. result headache.

2nd game - Similar to first one.

3rd game - I was about to give up to this game but I decided that I had spent good money on it and I really wanted to like it, so I played by myself trying to understand the rules properly... result: I had a better taste i lost and I decided I needed to read the rules properly.

4rth game: I undestand the rules and I really like the game, is the first time I find so imnteresting a solo game, I found myself speaking loud when I kill one enemy, I feel happy when I manage to achieve things... I lost again buy I am happy!

5th game: I managed to conquest a city, I lost again, I barely need to see the rules... I am thinking to play again against the guy who taught me the game.. I will defeat him...

Dont give up to this game, I was about to do it, but I didnt`and I am really happy for enjoying a game I can play by myself without feeling I am losing my time!! givi it a try!!

UPDATE: after 6 months... it is my first 10 (appart from chess).

I bought this game because it's considered to be the #1 solo board game. And it definitely lives up to it's name. There's so much to do, so many choices, tons of different mechanics all blended so well into this game.

This game oozes theme, but under all that chrome is a tightly packed Euro that uses deck building and hand management to determine exploration, discovery, battles and magical abilities. The game is rules intensive but intuitive once the basic mechanics are understood. Game play can be severely punishing, but that's part of the challenge of this game. More so than other solo games, I really like the solo play of this one.

Mage Knight is the  game I was waiting for. Beautiful, smart, varies with possibilities of scenarios diversifying the parties and our approach to the goal. The material is great and the mechanics of deck builder and combat without are for me who hates chance, a treat. Be careful though. To appreciate it, it is best to discover it with an experienced gambler or be ready to pay the investment time he asks. In addition, playing more than two players is very long and the player battles are devastating and can be frustrating. So if he still tempts you, go for it, you will not be disappointed.

I've always been intrigued by things like Talisman, Runebound, and such, games that give the RPG exploration experience without being a grinding slog, but they always fall short in some way (usually with a LOT of downtime.) MK the boardgame seems like a worthy entry in this area, and I'm looking forward to some more plays (we played the basic rules, and we got a couple of them wrong).

As a multiplayer game, the game board is not big enough.  Every time I played some other players were ahead of me getting all the encounters.  I literally could not catch up and pass anyone so I could get some encounters.  It is fun at first.  But you are mostly building for the final battle like Dark Tower or Talisman.

I do wish I had this back so I could try solo play though.

This game either needs a bit more work or will be easier to play when more familier with the rules. I feel that this game has alot of potential but is trying to rush into it all at once.

Our doozie. After spending several days learning the rules and playing our first two games, we put Mage Knight away and haven't pulled it back out since. I look at it all the time, wanting to play, because it's a terrific puzzle. I want to know what the later scenarios do. Eventually, we'll find out. It's so daunting to take it down, though, so this will probably have to wait until a holiday.

The movement aspect can be frustrating but this game still gives a good feel of adventure/exploration while making it feel like you are indeed a powerful mage knight (just one who is really bad at moving around). I like the exploration feel of this game, but dislike that there aren't imminent threats that you have to deal with, which makes it feel more like a puzzle rather than a frantic race to save the world. I am not a fan of how the rule book of this game functions, and had a really hard time learning how to play it.

I remember playing adventure games like Runebound wishing for a decent experience. I think what always killed them was random encounters. Most of those, if not all, are also lifeless dice chuckers.

MK takes deck building and makes it a central mechanic, yet not the entire game. You move, discover, new creatures are put out and you see them from a distance, making planned encounters. You visit locations, and because movement in the game can be fairly liberal, not to mention locations plentiful, there's little "man it's going to take me 5 turns to get all the way over there", it's more like "I can't wait to see what's over here".

Like any other deck builder you can have some soft turns, but because you can retain cards you can build toward more productive combat or purchasing turns. In the interim there are places you can easily sit for valuable resources or places to go and heal; villages are especially nice for the pillaging, IE extra cards for the next turn.

The game will play in about 45 minutes a player, so it's not short yet you are always looking forward to your next turn. There are some seriously creative ways to combo cards and you really do ave to think about the best way to use your hand each turn. One of the best things about hand management is that even is you cannot use a card for its face function it can still be used as a one value of one of four functions. 

It's also wild to see the pacing of the rounds as they are dictated by players. Sometimes you want to burn through your deck to rush other players and harm their progress, other times you'd rather let them end the round (since ending the round means you have to skip a turn). 

My initial rating was an 8. After a 3p, 2p, and a solo I now give it a 9.

[microbadge=5][microbadge=670][microbadge=13167]([microbadge=5792])

Mage Knight Board Game is a problem.  There are a few reasons.  One of those is a matter of expectations.  People were comparing it to [thing=22]Magic Realm[/thing] right off the bat, as a large scale sandbox fantasy adventure game.  Some even called it a streamlined MR.  This is not the case.  MR is sandbox-y because you actually have the freedom to do what you want.  MK un-streamlines the process by introducing deck-building which restricts your actions each turn.  No longer can you do what you want (and possibly fail, but at least you can try).  Now, you need to draw the right cards at the right time (more on that later).

Another touted expectation for the game is that it is the ideal solo game.  Again, not really the case.  The reason that it works well solo is that there is no downtime with no other players, and each additional player slows the game down immensely.  Yet without interaction, the game is reduced to an excessive puzzle that plays you as much as you play it, rather than a game with meaningful decisions.

I guess I could note some good things.  The locations are, in the abstract, thematic and logical.  In fact, a lot of the individual isolated mechanics are thematic and logical.  It's the combination that seems like a problem.  The game requires a commitment to learn deck manipulation for each of the numerous situations you get yourself into, and those commitments are full of losses until your find your footing.  This is not to say that games should be easy, but games should be scaled.  MKBG has lots of scale: the plethora of scenarios is impressive and worthy of praise on its own.  The scale of the game requires tweaking, else the commitment the game requires may never be completed.

It's kinda terrible that movement is completely random but combat is not.

I feel like I need to repeat this one more time for emphasis: Movement is randomized.  Combat is predetermined.  When has this ever made sense in an adventure/RPG game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Don't listen to the negative Nancies! This game is awesome for the right personalities. It may not be your type of game, but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve every point of the ten that I gave it.

This is my favorite game of all time, if I have 3-4 hours in which to play it. I play with a partner, cooperatively. I understand that more players or PvP are not recommended. The solo/duo coop games are epic and the pace is great; I feel like I advance in power and am challenged consistently.

The heavy theme of the game makes it somewhat easy to remember what the possible actions are every turn. There's a village... what can you do at a village? Well, we can see the healer, recruit, or plunder it (sorry, no taverns). Mage Guild? Recruit, or learn a spell, but you can't heal there.

Each game is different. The random aspect of the terrain makes it like a puzzle - do I want to sacrifice now to push into early power, or take a chance I'll draw the one card I need to be more effective this turn? I might need to find and add more movement cards or skills if this particular game has more difficult terrain. What if I can't find them? Then I have to conserve resources and maybe skip certain sites. The game is well balanced - I barely win most of the time, but not always. It is a little easier now, since I have played so often, so we increase the difficulty of the cities a little bit and suddenly it is challenging again.

The instructions are annoying in the way that some of the rules are only found in the "walkthrough", so you have to flip back and forth between the books until you find that one rule you needed to reference. But they are very clear and the card interactions are immaculately clear. I'd liken it to Magic: The Gathering. There is almost zero ambiguity once you find the appropriate rulebook section. I did go to the BGG after a year or so of playing it and found two subtle rules that I was playing incorrectly. They weren't huge, but it was a little bit fun to learn about them. Everything else I gathered and played correctly from the rules themselves over 2-3 games (my usual learning curve for any game).

"Heroes of Might and Magic" as a luscious and addictive board game.  I have found that even non-gamers can sometimes get hooked by their first few turns of Mage Knight. Playing your hand efficiently is an addictive puzzle, and exploring and revealing new tiles is ridiculously fun. Buying new actions, spells, and units is soooo satisfying. You can go from struggling against minor orcs to snapping your fingers and killing dragons in a single play session.

One of the absolute best solo games out there, and great with two players. Drags with four unless you all know what you are doing. I can't imagine playing competitively.

This game is now in my top 3 of solitaire games, and is the only game that I know of not designed specifically for solo play that actually is an amazing solitaire experience. I'd even say I prefer playing it solo, as I'm not really a fast thinker when I play it so I can take my time and really immerse myself in the game.

This game is an adventure RPG game where you character develops and gets stronger but with deck building and puzzle mechanics.  You get a hand of cards and determine what you want to explore.  You may end up with an encounter, at times, you may have a chance to get additional cards that may allow you to succeed on the encounter or you can lose.  

The game has an adventure exploration element but the combat is more of puzzle.  This absolutely is the game that anyone who "likes" Magic Realm (no one actually likes Magic Realm, they like punishing themselves) should play.  Mage Knight unlike Magic Realm is actually a good game.

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting and fun game.  
It suffers due to the length and really drags with more than 2 players. 
It also falls victim to another design issue, where the mechanics basically encourage you to take as long as possible to execute your turn, as maximizing the effectiveness of your cards is rarely an easy task, and the success of an endeavor is usually pass/fail (rather than on a spectrum).
Other than that, though, excellent game with a lot of content to explore.

RATING: 6
Initially, I rated this game a 9.  I love the idea of the game; it includes so many elements of adventuring, from allies and spells to artifacts and abilities.  The integration of light deck-building and hand management also seemed a good and fun fit to the adventure genre.

Ultimately, though, I had to lower my score to a 6.  The game is far too long for the amount of stuff you actually get to do.  In a given game, you will only cycle through your abilities four to six times.  You will get that cool card in your hand, only to either wait around for it to get used, making limited progress, or end up using it as a default "1" of anything.  Those cool allies and units?  You'll use them perhaps three or four times, total.  Those spells you can acquire?  You'll be lucky to cast them more than once or twice.  There is a ton of content here, but actually getting to use it in a satisfying manner is not present.

Moreover, there is a very limited power curve.  Thanks to the vagaries of your card draws, you may be just as unable to defeat an enemy on turn one as toward the end of the game.  The "best" way to play the game seems to be to really milk turns for all they're worth, caching up crystals from mines and using cards very slowly to build up a perfect hand; the problem is that not only is that type of game play rather boring, but it also makes a very long and slow game even longer.

Simply not enough payoff for the effort you put in.  A good design, with good components, and a heck of a lot of variety, but there are other games that hit the same adventuring niche with a lot less time commitment and generate a lot more fun.

RATING: 5
I'm just not yet sure about this game. It's very well produced.  There are several mechanics that I could enjoy, but it doesn't feel very satisfying (yet) when I play them. Defeating the monster tokens is a card puzzle, if you happen to have the correct card draw you kill it. And because you may or may not get great movement cards, you don't really spend much time thinking about what token to go after. I suppose it would be more fun if there were more opportunities to develop your deck and then cycle through that deck several times a turn. Then I'd be "making my own luck" .... But you see each card once per turn. Your character is mostly developed via tokens and follower cards you collect. This is fun....and as you get more power the monster token numbers ramp in a fairly predictable fashion. 

The ice/fire element for fighting is another aspect that could be interesting, but again, it's not really something you can fully develop and then take advantage of in your character. If you develop great cold ice attack ability, then hope you are near a token that will make that useful. It's fairly random. 

Bottom line: I feel mostly the victim of luck in card draws amd occasional blind monster token flips. I don't feel like there are a lot of fun, exciting, or interesting decisions. The increase in my character's power (and the monsters you fight) is fairly scripted, unless opponents take all of the good monsters. 

I wouldn't mind playing this game more with 2 or 3 players to see if I am missing something. But at this point, I'm not as excited as I'd like to be to play it.

RATING: 9
9/2012 Impressed after first two-player game.  It takes a long time, but time flies - usually a quality sign.  It's basically an exploration adventure game; roaming the landscape beating monsters collecting loot.  Gaining experience evolves your character with added abilities; recruiting units, mercenaries, wonderous equipment and the like, means you can challenge larger monsters and ultimately the large city castles.  Mechanics draw elements from several other games bringing them nicely together.  Deckbuilding has been popular lately and there's some here too, but thankfully not too dominant.  With time the constant monster-bashing will become tedious; game-altering expansions will eventually be required to keep interest.

RATING: 9.5
A fantastic blend of deck-building, exploration, character progression, and fantasy theme. My only complaint for the base set is that Norowas (one of the heroes) feels slightly underpowered in comparison to the other heroes, primarily due to his skills revolving around whatever recruitable units happen to appear for the player.

Excellent for solo play, as well as 2-3 player coop or competitive. I would not recommend this game with 4+ players unless all players have prior experience.

RATING: 6
What I posted here are the posts I made in a local Hong Kong Forum:
Played a 4 player trial session yesterday, and my opinion about this game is quite mixed.
For me, this game is definitely not a good example of RPG mix with boardgame. I agree that the game design has many good points, but it's pitfalls are equally evident. In a RPG game, you're the one who choose what you want to do, even though you may not be good at doing that. In this game your choice is limited by the cards that're being dealt to you. In Thunderstone you're facing the same problem (someone in BGG mentioned it's just like Dilbert in dungeon, can't find the appropriate equipment at the right time), however it's way more evident in MK as your deck won't redraw until the next turn. So in Thunderstone I could still hope to get a good combination after reshuffling sometime later, in MK if you got a handjam early (aka land curse in MtG), your choice in the whole turn would be ultra-limited.
This game also lacks theme. During teaching I'm not sure what should I tell my teammates. I know I'm a mageknight, but the setting? Additionally, the monsters all don't have characters and are being represented by symbols. So even in fighting monsters I'm more like calculating maths rather than rolling lots of dice and fighting with modifiers. After finishing the game, sadly I have the say, the memory is much less fond compared with Dungeon Run, which has a worse design but full of theme. Mind you that I've played lots of old Mage Knight before, and this game reminds me nothing of it. It could simply be renamed as Rune Knight, Mage Quest, Tomb Dweller... or anything you could think of.
In addition to this, I'm the rules teacher so I need to face all those rules problem with little time playing myself
How about the good points? The level up and influence system is excellent. The spell, advanced action and artifact design is extremely clever and integrates smoothly (once you get past the rules) with your ability deck. The mana dice system both gives game a bit of theme about time and efficient.
1 last word: Don't try this game with 4 players. Downtime is just a problem as in other games, you could think about what you can do during other's turns. In a 4 player game the mana dice is going to change a lot and you could have no effective planning.
Overall rating: 7.5
Q1: How's this game compared with World of Warcraft the boardgame?
I just know that someone would ask this question
Both games are actually quite weak in RPG aspect. I'd say it's just like Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry in video game, in which there is a story, but the main enjoyment is hack and slash. If you really want to compare, WoW's RPG component is even stronger as in the endgame you either fight the other team (alliance vs horde) or a well known WoW evil boss.
The combat system can be viewed as an excellent example of ameritrash vs euro design. Both uses the 'hero only ranged attack then both closed attack' phase design. (is it a coincidence? I really doubt it) In WoW, the random factor comes from the dice rolling and you know what monster you're facing before the fight. In MK, if you know what's your opponent, then there is no random factor and it's pure mathematic calculation. If you don't know (like fighting in dungeon), then the randomness comes from the tile drawn.
Both games' level up system are among the best of all games I've played. Personally I love the WoW system better as it captures the' 3 specialisation per class' extremely well even in a game with so much dice throw. MK's system is very functional, but is too functional making every advancement you got become 'attack +2' instead of 'fireball' in WoW.
Both games have similar complexity. MK is easier to teach as you can tell others the new rules only when the cards are revealed. In WoW, you need to tell other players every rule from the start and preferrably all players should familiar with their class decks in order to speed up the game.
edited on 9/6/2012: rating dropped from 7.5 to 6. With repeated plays the downside become much more evident: lots of calculations, extremely prone to AP together with lots of downtime even with 3 players, make my copy quite likely to sit on the shelf for quite some time.

[Played 30 times]

Convoluted "exploration and combat" fantasy game with a lot of options and bits.

The co-op version is easy and unrewarding; difficulty can be adjusted, but the game still lacks tension: it is a big puzzle to constantly analyze and has a terribly unsatisfying  anti-climatic ending (fixed by the expansion, but a serious flaw in the core game).

I feel as if it was designed for competitive play and yet also sold as "co-op", since it still works decently enough... but sadly it does not feel compelling or rewarding enough. Besides, it is solo play with a common goal, no real cooperation needed.

The competitive version has its issues as well (mainly a pronounced "rich gets richer" and the occasional random element that boosts or kills you; e.g. a summoner evoking the only enemy out of six that you cannot defeat).

It is bloated and variance seems more due to "mass" (multiple similar things) than really different actions to do.
For a game with all those rules and details, it is amazing how it completely fails to "tell a story" (it is just a puzzle that can be interesting to solve).

Lenght and downtime are a worrisome (especially dreadful with newbies and "slow thinkers"; the state of the board typically changes too much to plan when it is not your turn, so you spend more time waiting than playing).
It is way too long for what it offers with multiple players.

The rules are spread over two rulebooks and many reference cards (that are not just a reference, since they mention some rules that cannot be found elsewhere); it may ease the learning of the game, but it is atrocious to use later to find a single rule or clear a doubt.

Improved by the expansion (but I've no intention to ever play it again with more than 2 players).

RATING: 8
My only complaints are the rulebook, time requirement, and steep learning curve. If you can get beyond that, there is a TON of great game here. I wish I could set aside more 2 hour solo games.

It's a puzzle. Get from point A to B and be strong enough to accomplish the goal at the end. Develop and adapt a strategy on the fly. Fantastic game.

RATING: 8
I love the amount of freedom I get with this game as well as the re-playability.  The world map can be completely different each time and the epic scale of the game is unmatched.  I love the setting: Immortal demi-gods trying to conquer the land with massive armies, powerful magic, and awesome artifacts.  The whole thing climaxes with massive city battles, something I've never seen done in an adventure/role-playing board game, or for that matter, a video game RPG before.

The biggest problem is that all this kind of gets lost in the weeds of the mechanics.  I know I'm sieging a keep, defended with golems with my army of illusionists, and crossbowman.  But I have to continually remind myself of it because all of my energy is spent puzzling over card play.  It's such a waste of a great adventure to be stuck in the minutia of rules.  Reminds me a lot of modern iterations of D&D actually.  

The card puzzling can be fun in itself, but I feel like the game could be run entirely from a spreadsheet and it wouldn't change much.  I feel that the game is overrated just a bit and I can think of more than a few things that could have been done better.  It seems that we Americans get a little too romanticized over European game designers for some reason, I also saw this with the designer of Earth Reborn.  "Hey this guy's name is hard to pronounce, his game must be awesome!".  ER is another game way too consumed with fiddly rules for its own good.

Like Runebound, the game is also almost too unwieldy with more than a couple players, especially when everyone is agonizing over their cards.  But if someone is over-thinking his moves, while someone else is rushing, the quality of the game really goes down and you get a run-away player.  The game works best when played alone.

This ultimately does too much damage to the game's epic world and simply cannot make up for its shortcomings, and for that this is surpassed by Runebound, a game that I hardly play anymore.  I feel that Talisman generates a far better, more pure, fantasy adventure that still provides an underrated and timeless strategy experience.

Might be my favorite game ever. Certainly the best solo/solitare game ever.  I've actually only played this solo.  Don't frankly need anything more than that.  Just like I've never bowled a 200 score or better (it's on my bucket list; high score is 189, and that was in high school), I've been trying like hell to beat 200 in Mage Knight.  It's hard as hell, but I know it can be done, and I can't wait to have the time to do it!  Speaking of time, the ONLY reason this game isn't a 10 for me is that it's a major time investment.  A normal solo conquest game of MK can take me close to 4 hours, and as a father of 4 in a small house - I have neither the time nor the space to devote to playing this favorite game of mine.  Hoping to make some time this summer for it though.  I'd go nuts if they made an iOS version of this game - PLEASE!
Here's what makes this game brilliant - it's like a giant puzzle. Sure, there is luck involved - with the tile flips and order of the cards in your deck.  But that's pretty much it for the luck - the rest is all using your brain to solve problems of how you search and explore and fight. And beating enemies/monsters is immediately rewarding - your already bad ass character becomes even more bad ass and levels up, and up and up, and gains more cool stuff with each level up. Awesome. The problem solving element is sickly awesome though; it makes your brain hurt sometimes, in a good way.  And time FLIES playing this game.  First time I played, I checked the clock and suddenly it was 2:00 a.m. - 3.5 hours had gone by and it felt like 20 minutes.  Love this game.
EDIT: I've since played a few multiplayer coop games and the game is still awesome.  I've also now broken 200!  (thanks to the LL expansion add-ons like new deed cards, etc.)

The more I play it the more I like it. I tend to play it solo the most because it is long, and time consuming. Turn can take a while with all of the mental calculations.

What a unique game...definitely the heaviest adventure game I've tried. Offers lots of tactical combinations. As a matter of fact, if you're not up for burning some brain juice, don't play this one! Much more to think about than in a similarly-themed game like Runebound. The cardplay is very cleverly designed.

Only bad thing I can think to say about Mage Knight is that the theme didn't *quite* shine through as much as I would've liked - I felt like I was adding up numbers instead of having a fantasy adventure. Take that with a grain of salt, because I only KINDA felt that way, and only maybe twice during my single play. I need to play this more, obviously. Its depth requires more experience to actually play with any degree of competence.



I've only played once, so this rating is very subject to change. 

EDIT. I played again, and this game is better than my initial appraisal. The theme is there, just not as spelled out for you as it is in some other adventure games. 

This game is deep. It took me six hours to finish a solo game today. But it's engaging, and provides a serious challenge. This game makes you think hard, while providing a nice epic adventure feel.

RATING: 9
I don’t usually play solo games (unless I’m testing decks for Warhammer Invasion), but in this case I’m glad I did before having to teach the game. The basic card engine is not overwhelming by itself, but it gives you a plethora of possible ways to tackle your choice of challenges on an open map, so it’s a case of option rather than information overload. Now that I’ve got two actual (and extremely enjoyable) two player games under my belt, I’m happy to say that the transition from learning the rules to actually playing the game happens quickly and is helped by the noticable effort to streamline everything without cutting down on the wealth of possibilities.

One example: if you assault centres of civilization, your reputation goes down by 1. I appreciate immensely that it’s not 1 for a keep, 2 for a city and 1 plus a magical curse for a wizard’s tower, and I posit that this demonstrates the advances Vlaada Chvatil has made since Through the Ages, where you spend the first dozen games making new and exciting rules mistakes.

It’s also a bit unusual for me nowadays to buy games without playing them beforehand, so chalk this down as another data point in favor of putting game rules online. From the rulebook, I could not only tell that this is an unusually open game with interesting mechanics (especially the magic-fueled cards), but more importantly that it has an incredible amount of replayability due to a dozen of scenarios with a couple of variant rules stacked on top of them.

So you certainly get your money’s worth if you are looking for a game you can play for the rest of the year without exhausting the possibilities. Card quality could be an issue if you purchase games mainly for stroking them with satin-gloved fingers whilst whispering "Mine ... all mine!", but otherwise you’ll be fine. We noted that they felt strange during the setup and then forgot about it for the rest of the night. The miniatures and cities look a bit garish out of the box, but they are actually pretty detailed miniatures, just with an extremely flat paintjob. Some drybrushing and inking improves them immensely, as I’ve found to my delight, and it won’t cost you more than 90 minutes.

So all in all, this is an unrestricted delight, with a single caveat: I won’t ever play this with three or four people unless everyone has played at least half a dozen games. Even with two, there were some moments where things stalled for a bit – mostly at my end of the table, I gotta say – due to the many, many things you could do. Otherwise, Mage Knight is a rare example of the hype getting it right.

This is a truly clever and perhaps even brilliant game, but the combination of downtime and mathy/puzzleness combines to make it far more suitable for solitaire play than for a group.  I do not know if I have ever had an experience where I was so filled with admiration for the board game design without actually enjoying the experience.

Also the euro style scoring mechanic at the end of the game blows....  oh, I could take out this mage tower but I have those points locked up so I will go beat down that level 1 green disk..... BORING!

This is an excellent game. Make sure to go beyond the First Reconnaisance scenario to enjoy everything this brilliant game has to offer.

The rulebook and the walkthrough are a bit confusing, but all in all the rules are easy to learn, and once you grasp all of them, the game will flow quickly and seamlessly.

If you want to learn how to play and don't have anything more didactic at hand than the rulebook, check out the Box of Delights' videos. Ricky Royal does a great job in explaining all the rules while keeping you interested from beginning to the end by the tense gameplay.

Oh my stars, how I adore this game. Primarily played solo (though I've played it 2p as well), and the intricate, clockwork-puzzle like nature of each game - while still feeling unique each and every time - is what keeps bringing me back.

Great theme, excellent replayability, and combines deckbuilding, fantasy adventure, card combat, and just a hint of randomness to make a delicious stew.

Not for everybody, and some of the rules are counterintuitive (Fire/Ice/ColdFire resistances, I'm lookin' at you), but once you crack it there's nothing like it.

The game is a mix between an puzzle and a fantasy game. I'd prefer plastic enemies instead of paperboard circles, it would be more thematic.

There are a lot of specific rules, so I have to constantly interrupt the game and read the manual, which increases the length of the game.

So it's ok for me for solo playing, but hard to play with more people.

RATING: 9
We like this very much, but it hasn't seen any play since Gloomhaven. Yet the games are different enough. In Mage Knight you go in one game from zero to hero, while in GH this takes a long time. Mage Knight is also a deckbuilder and the game resembles Might & Magic to some extend. Why is this not a 10? The combat system is a bit complex regarding resistances, dual resistances and dual elementary attacks. This makes it really hard to play by the rules, because you can easily miss stuff. The play time is also on the long end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After 4 sessions. First session lasted 4 hours - none of us realy knew the rules. The two next lasted 3,5 hours. The fourth one took just under 3 hours with players all familiar with the rules.

In a nutshell: This is Heroes of Might and Magic as a board game.

+:  Deck building mechanisms work perfect. Excellent varried artwork (and painted miniatures!!). Fantastic universe that you get to explore. Lots of ways to interact with the game. Fantastic feeling of adventure throughout the game. Lots to think about and plan in between your turnes. Hardly no luck involved - allmost all info is availible to players all the time (that is why you can plan your turns). Very immersive game experience. The VP system is not abstract: what helps your character to grow stronger in the game also scores you VP accordingly. 

-: PvP is not that fun. A lot of downtime with four players. Quite multiplayer solitaire. Some of the spells (ie. actions) just makes the game innesseserily over complicated. Lacks a catch up mechanism - if you fall behind it is very hard to catch up withe the leading player(s).

Advice for playing this game: This is a game that lets youexplore a great fantasy world. It is about boosting your character and maximize the impact of your actions. Pure power play! Wack monsters, level up, take over castles, explore new worlds, maximize the impact of your move, fighting and influence in the country. If you can enjoy that, you'll love this game. Always use the time in between your turns to plan. Don't look for PvP interaction and fighting. Don't expect a smooth 1 hour eurogame and don't expect the grand war and territory control of an american style game. Excpect a little bit of both and an ÄWSÖMË travesty and adventure.

An amazing take on adventure games by Chvatil. An excellent mix of modern "euro-ish" mechanisms (hand management, deck building, resource management, variable player order) and fantasy adventure setting (bash monsters, other characters, level up, gain fame and fortune, burn down monasteries :) ). The day and night rounds with their different tactics is a fantastic addition to the genre. And it looks like replay value is almost infinite.

RATING: 8
After 7 plays, very addictive, interesting, and challenging.  Takes a while to get into the 'groove' of what it takes to be score points, kill stuff, etc.  Don't give up after one or two plays as it is simply a hard game to get your mind around quickly.

The rulebook situation is a negative - give me one all-encompassing rulebook.  There are two rulebooks plus little cards describing sites.  There is small wonder that there are many rules questions given there is no way to look up rules effectively and even when I find something I worry that this is not the 'answer' I am looking for.

After more plays the rating moves from a 9 to an 8.  The four player balance is crazy random.  Sometimes it isn't much fun.  The three-player is outstanding, so we will work on something to tweak the 4P until we find something that works for us.  This game is too original and interesting to give up on.  Did I say this game is original?  The most original game I've played in years.

Avoid the 4P game.  After more plays, it very often leaves one person far behind and not having fun anymore.  Seems there are no good ideas on how to balance the 4P game better.  Stick to 3P or less.

I had a real hard game rating this game.  I've played once (learning game) and there are aspects of it that I really like.  Great feel for adventuring.  Good mix of luck, but you can still plan.  Good job of representing character development in a card deck.

Have some gripes though.
1)  Everything is a card and at times I had trouble keeping track of all the decks.  The table we were playing on wasn't large enough for the map and deck; which didn't help.

2)  The monsters are dramatically changed by icons, but the icons do not pop off of the token like the other stats.  Multiple times I thought I had the ultimate move only to be remidned that there was a grey arrow symbols blending in with another grey blob which completely changed things.

3)  Optimal play requires you to juggle both a hand full of variable powers and (to a lesser extent) the dice pool.  You can somehwhat plan in advance, but some elements (dice, hidden monsters) aren't revealed until mid-game.  This led to very long turns, especially if you missed an icon (see #2).

4)  This really needed player aids.  The potential monster list, icon definitions, and game scoring are all in differnet books.  There are helpful terrain description cards, but there's like 15 different unique terrains and a lot of searching and flipping was needed.

The game was too long for me for what it is, but I think after repeated plays it'll play much faster.  I see this likely to go up in the future.

The strategical planning in this game is difficult since the environment and situation varies greatly from turn to turn. Five random cards in your hand gives you mostly only tactical choices.

This game violates my desire for sane rule book size/complexity, and as a result it's a bit difficult to play without accidentally breaking a rule once in a while. Also, the size and length means it cannot come out often.

3 / 5 - Good 

First things first: really this is a game for 2 players. It's slow moving and time consuming and I find myself loosing interest in the solo version, and more than two players is too long. That's problematic as it pushes the game down the interest radar. Beyond that it's pretty good: packed with variety and choice, challenge and narrative just as an adventure game should be. Indeed rather more so than most of its competitors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun game in which you can really "feel the weight" of all upgrades and cards you add to your standard deck. Its difficulty is rather hard and making a mistake or two can cost you the game. The map randomization can also be annoying and if you're unlucky you'll have to backtrack. I think this has to do with my fear of getting "wound cards", I've read that you shouldn't be afraid of them.

I've played four games so far, all co-op. 3 games were 2-player ones and they took approximately 3 hours each. The 3-player game took 5 hours. Didn't win a single time. 

For new people I suggest you don't play any heavy scenario and really advice people to plan their turns ahead to minimize game time. 

*EDIT* I'm increasing my rating on this to a 9. It's amazingly fun to play solo. Not as hard as I first thought, it's all about adapting.

Mostly deterministic, mostly Euro adventure game with a real sense of place and purpose. Genuinely gives an epic experience of striding the land, recruiting a posse (sometimes by force or fear) and turning cities to your will. Cool, but definitely a solo game.

The TI3 of solo gaming. If you had heard about what games I had played during my high school and college years, you would think this would have been an instant get, and it was. This ended up being a game which once I heard about it me thinking it could be the greatest thing ever. For reasons, it just took forever to finally get it played.

In short, it's basically everything it was advertised it was to be. You take a hero and warmonger the hell out of the land. Hell yes. It's big. It's epic. It's a standard Vlaada game and hence an initial rules barrier and likely more of a messy game than many would want. You probably love the hell out of this game or you don't. I'm squarely in the loving the hell out of it.

If there are to be cons, I will say the rules will be on the higher side. Ricky Royal's Youtube series is stellar for getting your mind around the rules. As bad as the rep for the rules is for this game, I will say this. It flows amazing well once you do get a hang of it.

I can't even being to imagine playing this with AP prone people. This is going to be played solo or with a friend. I even warned him that when this gets played it will between him and I even though there is more in our group. I think two-player offers a nice back and forth for giving each player downtime to think things through. Adding players to that is just going to drag things out. Three veteran players can probably plow through it decently enough, but it is still going to be a long haul depending on the scenario.

Components. *sigh* An all too high number of components come with this coating on it that made components stick. There was no real issue separating everything but still annoying to deal with. The cards have this coating on them. I hate the cards and sleeved them asap. All of my cards came with a slight bend to them. They seem to bend back into shape fine enough. Note: any component issues seem to be well known for any edition of the game. Frustrating but true.

Rating:

Game quality: -1 for lack of desire to play across all player counts. 9.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: Hell, yes. 9.

Do I want to play this if asked: Absolutely although time tends to interfere. 9.

Overall: 9.99.

What I like:
- No dice for combat!
- Gaining skills and cards as you gain experience
- Exploring new areas
- Works for solo, coop, or competitive

What I don't like:
- Like many others, it is long for how much enjoyment I get out of it
- Hard to remember how some of the monster effects work because some are only slightly different from each other
- I felt like with the city conquest scenarios, there wasn't enough time to thoroughly explore every part of the map.  I only had time to fight a few monsters that were on the way to the cities, but there wasn't enough time to explore some of the other locations like mazes and ruins.  Of course, I could probably just create my own scenario that is a smaller map and do whatever I want.

The best 2-player game I have ever played. Yes, this game is difficult as hell at start - lots of rules and mechanics to learn, aka a very steep learning curve. But in 2-3 games you'll know most of the rules and will be able to master the game in 5-10, not needing to look at the rulebook, unless checking some very rare case. Also solo mode is very challenging and entertaining, though it is more fun in duo. This game is only for serious gamers, but if you are one, I can't think of a reason you would be disappointed. A complete masterpiece. Either you don't like heavy games or going to give a solid 10. Lots of scenarios, lots of replay value, co-op, competitive and solo modes. If you know a person who will most definitely like this game - 100% go for it. If solo - check gameplay/reviews before buying if this fill suit your tastes, but it is a great solo game nonetheless.

Rating: 2.9. Cannot be convinced to play this.

The reason why I would play a board game is due to the social elements of it. If I can never play Mage Knight with another human being, there is no point. First walkthrough took me about 5 hours. If I want a solo experience, I'll play a MMORPG, or some RPG on the iPhone... An occasional short solo board game like Friday is okay. Mage Knight? No.

Good game, it fits the solo for me, as does magic Realm.  The biggest drawback seems to be the length of the game combined with the down time between turns.   Yes, we should all study our moves,  but that isn’t the same as a good interaction component.

Playing solo removes that problem entirely and the game speeds along.

RATING: 7
Thoughts on first play : Interesting and well polished mechanics, the overworld/exploration aspect is the icing on the cake.

6-7 hours for a coop game felt waaaaaay too long for the experience though. At three players it felt like an eternity waiting for the other player's turns, I can't imagine with four players, it suffers from a lack of player interaction like in most deckbuilding games.

It's often praised as a solo game and I can easily see that, maybe two players is fun too, but with more than that, not so much.

RATING: 7.5
I can tell from even just the beginner scenario that there are a lot of moving parts under the hood, and I suspect it is a game that would reward a lot of plays (due to the high rules overhead). Some very tough decisions, but an enjoyable experience overall.  Expect I would rate it higher if I played it a bit more (which would require a considerable time investment) - but enjoy it enough to want to play again while the rules are still fresh.

Not suited for those prone to AP, as there would be a tendency to over analyse in order to optimise moves. 

Not suitable for casual play.  The base scenario seemed a bit aimless, but I suspect that this is because it is intended as an introduction and that the more advanced scenarios will give a greater sense of purpose.

Good: 
Unique gameplay mechanics revolving around shared resources and day/night cycles. 

Character advancement is well done and it feels like you are going from a character with a stick, to a overpowered hero/villain that can raze cities. 

You can play as a hero or villain, and the game tracks this and has consequences. 

Turn options are done by drafting cards, and then playing out the turn. Which makes it entertaining trying how to make the most of your turn. Well executed turns feel extremely rewarding.

Bad: 
This game is super complex. If you can successfully figure out how to play it you should get some sort of technical certificate. 

Because this is so complex it is absolutely not new player friendly. 

Playing this game with more than three, heck even two, has way too much downtime. 

The game is pretty lengthy so it doesn't hit the table very often. To further discourage getting the game to the table the long gaps between plays causes the rules knowledge to fade so we always need to go back through the rules to re-learn the game. /sigh.

Solid game. I understand all the hype and the high praises for the game. It is a "big" game in an average package. I don't like the aesthetics of the game at all. The gameplay is smooth after you know the rules. There is a lot of small things to remember. But, it is really satisfying to be able to move through the map and be able to clean a dungeon and claim your loot. A different approach to the classic medieval fantasy setting. Again, solid game.

Because of this game I finally know what I like best in games: puzzling, but also: creating a story. I really like to puzzle during the game to have the optimal move and afterwards I like to see where my journey took me and think about my choices.

A negative is the time it takes: I really have to schedule a play and when I do play, I tend to forget the time... :)

This game is a masterpiece. Its seems like an overwhelming amount of rules to start with, but they make sense and can be picked up fairly easily. Its a puzzle of hand management in how to do the most you can with what you have. Good sense of characters getting more powerful over time. Beautiful production. The only downside is I'm not fond of playing it with other people, AP just makes it drag. But, even solo it is awesome. Scratches my Magic Realm itch in far less time.

Pros. Euro Adventure !, lots of choice, huge replay factor, points based and solos very well.

Cons. Long setup time (30min), needlessly complicated, huge play time 4hrs on Solo! 

I really want to like this game but i find you spend more time trying to remember/ looking up ALL the many convoluted small rules for this game to really be 'fun'. Would take many plays for the points system to become intuitive and I don;t have the time.

RATING: 9
For an adventure game it doesn't really look promising at first. Dry, card driven puzzle solving, too few and too similar monsters, very limited space to explore, complicated rules. Yet it works beautifully, despite all this. The rules are easy to grasp, however looking-up the site references can be quite a bother. The replayability doesn't come from the monster encounters, or from the tight scenarios, which all have surprisingly different feel. It's from the wide variety of options, that you can use to customize and optimize your army and hero to reach the goal first. Although there's PvP combat, the game is neither competitive, nor cooperative, yet it's not multiplayer solitaire either- it's a healthy mix of the three. You have to keep an eye on the others, can hinder them without confronting directly, but sometimes it worths to work together to grab the loot for yourself at the final push.

All in all, it's great both as a brainy card game, and an immersive adventure at the same time.

From my wonderful 2012 BGG Secret Santa!
Anyone who has solved a Rubik's cube knows the thrill of mastering a puzzle.  Succeeding at Mage Knight feels similarly rewarding, but more so as the puzzle emerges anew each time players proceed through a game.  Learning to master this range of puzzle with all sorts of different tools and approaches is nothing short of fascinating. I wont speak of mechanics, theme, or even narrative here; the beauty of the puzzle stands alone.

I do often think about "fantasy sudoku extreme" when describing the game... Any part of that metaphor that comes across complementary is what is meant.

The game it's adventure (you will explore and conquer), it's character progression (your mage knight will evolve as your card deck and skills will do), and it's mathy (it's a struggle to optimize your resources in order to make your best move). So I can see both [i]eurogamers[/i] and [i]ameritrashers[/i] enjoying it.

RATING: 6.8
Mage Knight is best described as a Victorian-aged steam engine: cantankerous and complicated and requiring all its knobs and valves to be constantly tended and adjusted, but when it moves it does so with a ponderous majesty. It is a mess of different mechanics incorporating almost everything ever done to any fantasy-themed game ever, but pulls it off with them all contributing to the jello-like flow of the game. Beyind the perpendicular learning curve and the simply silly number of aspects to mind its main drawbacks are long play times and long down times. Its principal advantages are a good Heroes of Might and Magic-esque experience and a relatively controlled-random system.

Easily the best adventure game I have ever played.  The only issue I have with the game is the end game scoring where you get bonus points for having the most points in certain categories.

RATING: 5
Edit: I have revisited this game, and I think I like it more than I first thought. Definitely not some successor to Magic Realm, more of a min/ max, deckbuilder puzzle game with at least a fair amount of theme. Has none of the personality of MR, but still a decent game for the analysts out there. Works best, imo, as a solitaire game. Bumped from '3' to '5'. The rules, I'm afraid, deserve their bad rep. Easier to learn the game from videos that helpful souls have made.

Seems ok for what it is, but a little over fiddly and over-complicated (again, for what it is). I don't think it will ever really fulfill the 'Magic Realm Light" niche (for those hoping that it will) because it just seems too generic. In Magic Realm, when you played the Black Knight, you really felt like you were playing the Black Knight. All the heroes were so distinct, and the world of MR has such a cohesive theme. Even so, Mage Knight may fill the role of a hack and slash RPG strategy game for people not put off by the complexity. Plays fine solitaire (in fact, may even play best that way).

This is a game I would prefer to play in sessions over two or three days because playing a whole game is quite exhausting, even though it's fun.

I was engrossed in the game while I was playing, but the thought of all the WORK of getting it all set-up again, re-learning all the rules, and then re-checking those rules while playing led to me saying goodbye.  The deck-building and exploration were my favorite parts, and I have other games that do it better and faster.

need more plays before i settle on a score, really like the crystal power up aspect.. not sure on the domion skill card hard bit.. needs more race for galxy style search deck for card cards..intial mind puke thoughts..also in the box are more rules and cards and cities so does look epic.. i hope i can play a shorter game as the length was the only put off so far
i think i got a good rules graps from the get go. becuiase of the simlar games and the vid tutotal i watched

play it few and far between because its a beast.. should i sell it?

I was thrilled to play this first, as it was heralded to be the next generation of adventure board games after Runebound/ROTH/Prophecy, but soon discovered that this is not an adventure game at all. Rather, the resource management and analysis of your own deck reminds me more of MtG. The "Discovery" aspect is very low, and if you want story, you have to make it up yourself. It's still a very good game in its own right, just no adventure.

Mage knight is incredible! However,it must be said that the learning curve is very steep. Players must be willing to spend some time learning and exploring the games possibilities. It is not meant to be played in a casual way. Mage knight demands that it is front and center without any distractions. It will take dedicated players at the very least a couple of games to fully understand the rules. However, once everyone makes it through some games,the reward is well worth the effort, one of the most satisfying gaming experiences awaits you!

This is a fantastic game, but it is extremely complex and takes a very long time to play.  If I could play this more frequently, play time would reduce, but there's no getting around the long setup time and steep learning curve.  Sadly, it's not so much that it's overly complex, it's that it is extremely fiddly in the rules.  Everything is a special case...though while thematic, makes for a lot to memorize or reference.

With that said, it's really a superb game and worth all of the praise.  I just wish I had more time to play it.  After several plays I feel as though I barely understand the game's overall strategy, which is actually a compelling thing.

I should really try it solo, where I understand it shines.

RATING: 7
A bit too much complexity worship, deeply frustrating at times and difficult to teach/learn. However, there is a lot of good stuff in it, and it's got a fun theme.

Once you do "get it," it's kind of fun. It's probably not worth what I paid for it, but I got it anyway, which probably makes me what they call "dumb." Still, because it works solo and will be mostly played solo or two-player (thus limiting the downtime), it might end up being worth it in the long run.

It better be, because after the credit card statement comes, I might be dead.

One early and obvious criticism is the lack of unique abilities (other than one card) for the four characters. It should have been easy to individuate them with several cards unique to their respective decks. You can buy new spells, acquire artifacts, etc., but the game is usually winding down by the time you get one or two, so it's not that big a factor.

Oh, the Hell with it. Traded it away.

Great fantasy sand box type game. Not for everyone. The rules are very exhaustives trying to include every situation, but the rulebook is a mess and the aussence of an index don't help precissely when you are looking for some particular doubt.

While playing, I felt like I was playing a computer game. With a puzzle game added in every turn. I'd rather be playing a similar computer game (less upkeep to manage). This was after a cooperative play (which a friend told me is the only way to play.) It seemed to me that the competitive game might be interesting, but the cooperative play was enough to tell me I don't want to own the system to find out.

RATING: 10
Rating based on 2 player games including also Lost Legion and Shades of Tezla expansions. 

We enjoy both the planning and characters' development. Depending on the scenario the time varies considerably, but even the short scenario are enjoyable, and the time required is well spent. This is really a rewarding fantasy game (with a reduced luck factor). Just beware of the quality of the cards, we often used glue to fix them before sleeving them.

RATING: 6
Modified rating due to the length of time that it takes us to play it.  We really enjoy talking through all of the moves and possibilities, so games take us a very long time.

PiFFed away, with Lost Legion.  Hopefully will find a home where it will get played more.  Mistfall, for us, is a better puzzly fantasy co-op experience.

RATING: 5.75
Well, finally played it and must admit to being underwhelmed. There seems an awful lot of procedure for what you are ending up doing, which is just playing cards to attack creatures, collect victory points in one of a million areas, and drawing more cards. very little deck management involved with minimal character differences showing up during play and a bizarre time scale (going 1st to 8th 'level' in three days? Don't we even sleep?) Odd you sack a town but it recovers next turn. Reputation seems very underpowered. Would have been nice if the different decks had different artwork. Glad to have a chance to try it but it doesn't seem to do anything Runebound or Magic Realm doesn't do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This rating would be higher if not for the game length. I don't think I can honestly say I'd never turn down a game or that I'd suggest it (the requirements for an "8" rating). The game is too long for me to suggest it except in the right circumstances. And unless I've been given wife clearance for the afternoon and early evening, I can't say I'd never turn down a game. Of course, if I am allowed to skip the "8" rating, I would definitely qualify it for the "9", which is "always want to play it".

With that said, I really like the game. The tactical puzzle that you are presented with on almost every turn is extremely satisfying.

The game is probably too long for what it offers, but I've only played twice. I'm hoping I figure out ways to speed up the game as I get more experience with it.

A friend and myself played through the walkthrough scenario. It seems like it would make for a great solo game. I'm looking forward to setting it up again to work through the solo scenario. The gameplay feels sort of simplistic, but there are interesting decisions to make every turn in deciding how to optimize your hand. The game still feels like number crunching to me, but this probably has some of the richest theme of my games. 

It's just too much of a pain to set up.

This game makes a great first impression.  It reminds me of all of those role playing videogames I played growing up, but with all of the choices you make a puzzle.  We are still working through the first scenario and have made it through 1 day.  There is quite a lot to learn, and it took us seven hours to get to this point, but I actually like the directions so far.  I really like that he set up the walkthrough scenario and numbered all of the components so that you could be introduced to each aspect of the game methodically while getting a chance to start playing. While there is a lot to learn the rules seem intuitive so that I feel like they will be easy to remember and understand when we get to know the game.  And the game has so many nice small thematic touches, like mana dice slowly getting removed from the mana pool as night approaches and forest and desert being easier or harder to move through if it is day or night, or your followers refusing to help you burn down a monastery.  One feature that I especially like is the victory point track (or fame as it is called) as in other games victory points are the goal to win but you don't get anything for gaining VP.  Here as you gain fame you become more powerful and unlock skills and the ability to gather peasants and wizards and foresters to your cause.  The reputation track reminds me of the Good/Evil type choices in modern RPGs, and I like that I have to weigh the tradeoff between pillaging a village for immediate gain, or improving my reputation so that I will have greater influence later on.  There are so many different aspects and rules to this game, but somehow they seem to work really well together.

I play games primarily with my wife, so I am fine with long games as we can leave them out and go back to playing on a later date.  I have to admit in between plays I get excited looking at this game sprawled out on our table and thinking about our next round.  We like games like Agricola Farmers of the Moor, Through the Ages, Brass and Le Hevre, so this game has just the right amount of depth.  I could see how a complicated game like this would be more challenging with a gaming group where you are always trying to teach new people to play.  I also think it will have good replayability because of the randomness involved in the monsters and cards and tile layout and different game objectives.  It plays much differently than these our other favorite games.  We have reached the point now where a game has to be both well made and different enough than our existing games to warrant a purchase.  What a brilliant game developer, I look forward to getting to know this game better!  

Update:  We are currently playing game 8 and this game is definitely maintaining its 10 rating, if anything I like it more with more plays.  After exclusively playing the full game standard scenario we are branching out and trying the "Mines Liberation" scenario.  This adds good variety to the feel of the game and makes it feel fresh.  I am looking forward to trying out the other scenarios now and eventually the expansion which seems to be well received so far.  Vlaada deserves a special thanks for coming up with multiple gaming scenarios for his game when just the base scenario would have made for a great game!

[u]7-Sep-2015[/u]:  Not surprisingly, I really enjoyed this. I thought the game seemed pretty cool a year ago when I played the First Reconnaissance mission twice, but you really don’t see what the game has to offer in terms of its depth. And there is definitely a lot going on here. However, while there are a lot of rules, they are really not that complex. I found them easier and easier to remember with each passing round of play. I had printed out two fan made player aides last year, but I found the two on the back of the rulebook and the walkthrough quite helpful and more than satisfactory. The reference cards with all the different locations can be a little fiddly, but they have all the info I needed, and any question I had was always answered.  So…lots of rules but not difficult to master.

The gameplay is really great too. The sense of adventure and exploration is fantastic. Building the map as you go is something I’ve always found appealing in a game, and there is a nice mix of tiles in the base game with various locations and monsters to discover, fight, and conquer. Speaking of which, combat is basically a puzzle. You don’t always know what monster you’re going to fight but with the aide on the back of the walkthrough booklet, you can have a general idea. So, you know you’re going to need a certain amount of block and a certain amount of attack to obtain success. It’s a matter of what combination of cards and mana in your possession will help you accomplish this goal. Over the course of the game, new cards will enter your deck and new Units will be added to your tableau, so to speak. It’s deckbuilding but on a much more subtle scale. The impact of those cards and Units are greater here than a single card in most other deckbuilding games, and I find that very interesting.

I played one full scenario and two of the shorter ones. I have mixed feelings regarding this. The game is long…in any scenario, IMO. And I’m afraid that will hold it back somewhat from further plays in the future. The full scenario is definitely the way to go if you have the time and space for it. The level up system seems to be built for it. You can take your time, go on several side quests, build your deck up, increase your skills, and add Units to your reinforcements. Then, you head into the endgame ready for action. With the shorter scenarios, I liked…well, that they’re shorter. But they also feel rushed in terms of the game itself. You’re basically focused only the endgame and just hitting the side quests that are close by, hoping to gain just enough to meet your goals. I felt like I am missing out on of part of the game in these two shorter scenarios.

So, overall, a definite winner. The game is a great design of many mechanisms that all work together to give the player a real sense of adventure and accomplishment. Being able to level up your character helps add to the experience and the connection you have with that hero, giving a bit of an RPG flavor to the game. And of course, the game almost seems built for specifically for solo play. It’s deep, challenging, and fun in a way that you want a solitaire experience to be. But it is long. And it can feel fiddly with all those components – tiles, cards, minis, tokens, more cards, crystals, even more cards, two player boards. But if you want that fully engrossing experience, Mage Knight can certainly offer that for those with the time and space for it.

I don't even know what to rate this. Until I wrap my head around the rules and the game stops playing me as a result, I can actually say something reasonable

*Update, Sept 7 2012* Trying to get rid of it. Too complex for what I'm looking for, in terms of learning the rules. Enjoyed it greatly when I played it one time with a geek who managed the fiddliness and answered my questions. I feel Through the Ages scratches a similar itch in terms of complexity. Also not a huge fan of Mage Knight's theme. Still, MK is a brilliant game and you most likely will not be disappointed with it.

*Update Nov 2, 2012* Regretfully sold it. Too much time and effort to unlock what really is a great game. Still, TtA is more enjoyable for me in every way so it couldn't survive the chopping block :(

Be glad to play with anyone who owns it and knows the rules, though!

*edit July 2013* Having seller's remorse. Thinking I may actually be able to get through this game as the playtime isn't overly long, as opposed to the other epic solitaire games I own. I'll hold off until I (at least) play more of my current favorite, Field Commander:Napoleon (which has relatively simple rules and playing time)

*Dec 2013* Well, I caved. Rebought it :p

*Jan 2014* Played First Recon and 1 Solo Conquest. I love this game, it's a ton of fun!

*Dec 2014* Game gets a 9; loses one point because sometimes it's a chore and a slog to get through (particularly when my brain isn't up to it). But when it shines, it's a beautiful 10.

Huge setup time, hard to explain to people, game length too much, you never enter battles you don't know you can win before you start, which makes them dull. Walking places takes so long you end up just going to the next closest thing instead of picking where you want to go. I don't like how you only add like 4 cards to your deck the whole game either. So little of this game worked for me.

impressive design.  like the twist on deckbuilding.  really has a gobload of options in the box and reasonable theme.  i like what wizkids has done with their higher level games like starfleet captains and now mage knight.   both are advanced gamers game designs that are very well done.

the sheer amount of options with the 4 characters in terms of "level up" abilities is neat and that does not even account how the followers/allies, spells and advanced cards work.

really well done and i am enjoying exploring.

A great blend of light adventuring, deck building, and puzzle. Nevertheless, I can only recommend this for solo or 2-person gaming; the down time otherwise will be huge and annoying. Also, supply of e.g. units does not seem to scale well enough so more players may fight too much over this.

Warning: Before buying a localized version, check for availability of the expansions.

Loved it first couple of games, played solitaire and with two. With two there is little downtime, as we play it coop and are trying to determine our best ways.

Theme is really strong, but it's also a little dry and mathy. Good solid game, really nice components, but still, for me there is something lacking.

Also, my first edition has a different cardback (offcolor) than my expansions, that's quite the bummer.

Incredible depth and complexity. Took a group of four almost 2 hours just to set up and understand enough to begin playing. Made many trips back to the rule book during play, but it was very exciting all the way through. There are some awesome mechanics involved in this game and the game materials are very well made. The competitive dynamics are very interesting; you work as a team but also for your own interests (there are also PvP rules you can choose to honor). It also seems as if there are many different ways in which you can set up and play the game, so I'm excited to explore the game's different scenarios and modes.
If you are a new owner of this game, I recommend taking the time to read the walkthrough book before sharing with a new group and watching a "how its played on youtube." There is a lot with which to become familiar. Have fun!

It  feels so satisfying when you manage to beat the two cities in the solo conquest. I can't wait to try out "The Lost Legion" expansion.

I want to rate this game higher because I feel it is so well designed. The balance of the cards, their multiple uses, and the subtle improvement as you add to your deck is all quite smooth. But at the end of the day, it's a dungeon crawler. You walk through the forest, stumble across an orc, cast fireball or swing a sword, and collect XP. Very well implemented, but just not an itch I need scratched. And the walking...it takes a lot of cards just to get somewhere.

Why Mage Knight gets a really high score?

Because it's fun. It's an interesting type of brain-burning and tooth-grinding fun that keeps you on the edge. You have a sense of urgency in everything you do, coupled with an almost tangible sense of progression and power as your overpowered hero stomps lowly orcs without breaking a sweat. 

It's modular, it's pretty, it's versatile, it feels a little bit like Heroes of Might and Magic 3-5, and it has an awesome expansion out that adds even more of everything. 

You do need to bear in mind, Mage Knight is also very long (2-3 hours for a good solo game), has a lot of fiddly little bits, a lot of cards, takes a lot space on the table, has some of the ugliest pre-painted minis I've seen, can be extremely tough to beat, requires you to know English (it's very language-based), probably isn't good for big groups, has a lot of rules that provide exceptions to the norm, a lot of symbols and iconography, a very weird manual that is confusing and useful at the same time and a high price point (since you WILL want to get the expansion eventually). Even with all of this, it's a pretty darn great game.

Outstanding game, and feels very 'open world'

It is a good brain burner, with a decisions taking a while to figure out the most optimal moves. But in my plays so far I just don't feel like I am getting enough power, so I never achieve anything or can finish the missions.

I need to understand how to be better at the game quickly or I can see myself not wanting to pull it out again, which will be a shame.

This also has a long setup time (despite me having the Broken Token insert) and is difficult to find players who know how to play.  Takes a long time to explain everything to new players, so the opportunity to play this really makes it a solo only game for me (which isn't bad because it works really well as a solo game)

Definitely worth keeping and playing, but if I don't get better at it soon then I will probs be shelving this permanently once Gloomhaven arrives

The ultimate solo game. I've never seen a game that so accurately captures the experience of playing an MMO- both the good and the bad. Character progression is slow but feels real and has impressive stakes; every choice you make is vitally important, every resource valuable, every chance you take potentially game-altering or game-ending. It's a hyperbolic design both in form and in feel, and it's perfectly amazing. It's length is the only thing that keeps it from hitting the table more.

This game really captures the essence of "a great idea but way too complicated and time-consuming to find other players to consistently enjoy with me" type of game.  I actually got this in trade from Warzone Matrix as part of a trade of ALL my old Warhammer 40k stuff, having never played Mage Knight but having the word of my friend Justin that it is an awesome and awesomely complex game. 

Finally got this to table with my friend Richard and we hated it.  Way too complicated to be able to simply enjoy the RPG adventure it promised.  Never taken out afterwards.  Sold at auction.

A great game with a solid theme, engaging game play and detailed components.  The deck-build aspect of it provides just enough randomness that you have to think around all the different ways the game gives you to work through the cards to give yourself the desired effect.  It feels great when you can chain six different cards, five different mana crystals/tokens/dice (some generated from the aforementioned cards) and three different units together to take down a city in one massive assault while getting away with it unscathed. 

I would strongly recommend sleeving the cards however, they seem prone to scuffing/chipping. 

Even after many plays, this game is still exciting and challenging.

Rated for the solo play, which is excellent if that's your thing.  I'm not yet sure it's mine...and what little 2-player I've done with it has felt a bit like multiplayer solitaire.

Extremely frustrating. Every turn is "here's why you can't do what you are trying to do." Stupid point salad at game's end feels at odds with the adventure theme. Long and un-fun.

I've had such a visceral reaction to the game, it's hard to put my disdain into words. I've been trying to figure out why I hate this game so much, and which aspects of it are present in other un-favorites.

First off, the movement seems to be very restrictive. As in, there are movement cards in your deck that either give you 2 movement points, or 4 movement points if you spend mana of the right color (the available colors are determined by rolling dice, and these dice go into a community pool - you are allowed to use 1 die per turn, at the end of which you reroll it and add it to the pool). There are different types of terrain, and they will cost anywhere from 2-5 movement points to enter. It seemed like I never had enough movement points to get where I wanted to go, or I had a 5-card hand of nearly all movement cards, so I could go a good distance, but had no idea what I could do once I got there (you draw back up to 5 cards at turn's end).

You are allowed to use 1 die from the community pool per turn, and you're never sure whether the color you need will be available or not. There are cards that give you mana crystals of the various colors, essentially you can bank mana to use in future turns, so that helps mitigate the luck there. There was a dragon on the board, and multiple times I had the firepower in my hand to destroy it but I lacked the proper crystals to activate my cards, or didn't have right color available in the community mana pool, or I lacked the movement cards to get back to his location. I can hang on to those offensive cards but if I do that, I'm only drawing 2 new cards for the next turn and hoping to get something that will let me move. You may discard a card to get a generic +1 move or +1 combat, etc. But it costs 2-5 movement points per hex.

I admit that I have trouble understanding the combat system and the various symbols on the monster tiles as well. There are a few times where I thought I had it sealed up only to find out that a siege attack is not ranged (WTF) or that it only takes half damage from fire attacks, etc. So I'd spend a few minutes calculating everything out only to be told why it wouldn't work. Time to start over and figure out what my other options are. Ya know what? Nevermind. It's your turn. In fact, much of Mage Knight for me is being told why I cannot do what I want to do. Not fun for me.

Speaking of not fun, the game is a real bitch for downtime. My turns tend to be long, which I hate. Other players' turns tend be long too, which I also hate. Watching someone take their turn in Mage Knight is akin to watching someone take a long turn in Dominion. I know they're working out how they're going to do whatever it is they are doing, and they are playing cards, grabbing crystals and dice and keeping tabs on it all: "Okay, I spend a blue crystal to activate this card which gives me 5 movement points which I use to move over here to this tower...he need siege so I'll spend a red die from the pool to activate this army and play this card from my hand which lets me take a spell and activate it...spend a green crystal and a black die...now, he hits me first and his attack is 8 so I have 4 block here and I'll activate him for 4 more block, then I play this card, and discard that card to activate..."

OH FUCKING KILL ME NOW.

I don't care what my opponents are doing. Not at all. The main thing that affects my turn is the dice available in the pool, and I don't know what those will be until the end of my neighbor's turn so it is difficult to plan ahead.

To sum up, Mage Knight for me is waiting for my opponents to finish doing story problems with their cards on their turn, so I can make them wait while I do story problems and continually find out that my answers are wrong and I need to start over. I don't even need to get into the point salad, which Kurt already covered pretty well.

I think all of the branching choices tend to overwhelm me when I can't parse the value of one vs another. And I have to sit and calculate out which paths are viable, which is tedious and frustrating for me. I need to throw out the cards I want to use or clog my hand with them while I wait for accompanying cards so I can finally use them.

One guy at the table loved it, and the other is on the fence. I know the game can be played well, and that my complaints here can be overcome - the other players did it fine. The game just feels like a chore to me. It's so mathy (or maybe it's the type of mathy) that it just kills the theme. I don't see a grand adventure of rampaging across the countryside killing monsters, burning monasteries and raping cattle. I just see a big damn spreadsheet. If I played it enough I could probably figure out how to be competent at it, but it's no fun and it takes 3 hours per attempt.

I dropped my rating down to a 2 and will never play that game again. There were multiple turns where I spent my time trying to do something, found out I couldn't, found no appealing options on the board and just did whatever would spend my cards and keep the game moving. "Oh, I can't defeat this monster...I can defeat that one over there...but I can't get there...I can get to that town...but I can't afford to recruit anybody there...okay, fine. I'll discard my hand and move into that forest. Done.

RATING: 7
What a well-designed game. It's incredibly deep, and yet it has buckets of narrative. Also, finally a deck-builder with some meaning and value to it. Can't wait to play it again.
---------------

Ratings update downward after a few plays of this, and a first play of Myth. Honestly, I do enjoy the mechanics of this, but it is essentially solitaire, and for the experience it offers - a fantasy narrative game - it overstays its welcome. Plus, with an AP player at the table who sits there for fifteen minutes trying to parse whether he has the exact right cards to pull off some combo, it becomes excruciating.

Lots and lots of options here.  Really enjoyed the choices I had to make.  Solo play (with the dummy player) is fun and requires you to closely manage your deck.  The first and part of the second round seemed very slow as your character doesn't have a lot of extra cards/skills/units yet.  But, by the time Round 3 came around, the options opened up quite a bit.  Looking forward to more plays.  On a side note, takes up a lot of table area.

Mage Knight has a number of things going for it. As a fantasy adventure game, it's got it all: exploration, combat, plunder, leveling up--you name it. As a solo game, the game's constraints present the solo gamer with an ongoing series of puzzles, and no doubt this is the most involved solo game I've ever played. Finally, underpinning both other aspects is a solid core of hand and deck management that takes Mage Knight over the top as a fantasy adventure game (so it's not [i]just[/i] wandering around, killing things, and taking their stuff) and provides the challenge in the solo game. If you're interested in all or even most of these aspects, I encourage you to try Mage Knight.

However, Mage Knight's excellence in these areas has me questioning how much these three aspects really matter to me, if at all. I started [rpgitem=44081]"killing things and taking their stuff"[/rpgitem] nearly 30 years ago, an I now find this tiresome theme somewhere between dull and despicable. I have to basically ignore Mage Knight's theme to find any enjoyment in the game. In addition, Mage Knight, considered the pinnacle of solo gaming here on BGG, has shown me that solo play of a board game is ultimately nothing more than an elaborate puzzle. Sure, it might be slightly more exciting than Sudoku, but there's also a lot more overhead, and I'm not sure I'm all that invested in this type of mental exercise. That leaves the hand/deck management as the main appeal for me, but there are plenty of other games that do the same thing in [i]far[/i] less time: Dominion, Blue Moon, Magic: the Gathering, and so on.

The nail in the coffin is the presence of [boardgame=1915]MECCG[/boardgame], which covers a lot of the same ground as Mage Knight. Most aspects of fantasy adventuring are present, and it's all done quite immersively in Middle-Earth, far preferable to Mage Knight's generic fantasy setting. Lacking a lot of Mage Knight's mechanical constraints, MECCG isn't as interesting for solo play, but before and after the game, the deckbuilding process provides plenty of solo enjoyment, especially if you're the keeper of the cards, trying to put together Arda decks and other game "environments." Indeed, I find this process of pseudo-design more fulfilling than puzzling through another round of Mage Knight on my own. If MECCG isn't enough, there's also the prospect of taking on the venerable Magic Realm, which [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/739015/mage-knight-worthy-successor-magic-realm]by many accounts remains the pinnacle of fantasy adventure board games[/url].

Having said all that, it might seem like I hate Mage Knight, but I don't. I'd still willingly play (against a single opponent) and think there's enough variety in the characters, cards, and scenarios to hold my interest for quite a few more plays. I just don't [i]enjoy[/i] it as much as the other options I mentioned nor nearly as much as its fans do.

Starting to really like this one. Trying to get more players into it. It is a brain burner but the epic feel makes it oh so worth it. 

After more plays, this game gets better. you start to know what cards to get and which is more powerful in the long run and which wouldn't be too wise to pick up earlier/later in the game. You just get better and really start to feel you have control over your deck where beginners may feel they are helpless. Even better with Lost Legion.

The sense of evolution and escalation in the game is excellent... the art is awesome... the mechanics are very well connected... it's an awesome awesome game...

A beast of a game too... it's long, combat is a bit "strange" for the normal combat rules in games and because of that is not very intuitive when we start, but it's not a barrier to play the game, it's just different but you'll get it very fast.

Introductory scenario played so far.  
The  game has the appealing leveling up, growing stronger, mechanic from a lot of RPGs I like.   The play is difficult to learn initially, but the average turn is pretty simple.  I would compare the learning style to Arkham, where the general game isn't complicated, but the shear amount of unique scenarios makes it so.

The Day/Night idea seemed pretty innovative to me.  It changed enough to be noticeably, but not too much where the game was radically changed. 

Had not quite  enough gameplay to really get the feel for the individual characters though.  Would be eager to try a longer variant and see how that goes.  As is, just as we were building up our characters, the game ended.

RATING: 9.5
This game revealed 2 of life's great truths to me:

1. A solo board game can be every bit as engaging and addictive as any video game

2. Vlaada Chvatil is an effing genius

The game also plays really well co-operatively, though teaching it to new players can be very daunting. In fact, that's the only thing keeping this game from a "Perfect 10," the barrier of entry and learning curve are very high. Even so, well worth the effort and can't recommend highly enough to anyone who isn't put off by a touch of complexity.

Have yet to try a competitive game.

While I like Gloomhaven a lot, this game progresses faster, has art on the player cards, and has so many more options through the cards, mana, and terrain.  I'd prefer a darker art; this has a Japanime look that initially kept me from a purchase.  The exploration creating unique challenges and the fantastic array of options make this an excellent and unique game.  However, due to the time to make decisions and to learn the rules, the game plays better solo or with one other experienced player in coop.  It is amazing how hard this game seems at first, but you'll get better with practice, and then you'll try different characters and missions to add variety and more difficulty.

Sokáig töprengtem, hogy megvegyem-e, de a szabályfüzet elolvasása után egyszerűen zseniálisnak találtam, hogy a pakliépítés mechanikát felhasználva mennyire nagyszerűen oldotta meg Vlaada az új varázslatok tanulását, a sérülések kezelését! Például a méregtámadás: egy sérülés kártya kerül a kézbe - foglalva a helyet az értékesebb kártyáknak - és egy plusz sérülés kártyát az eldobott lapokra is kell rakni, ez a kártya csak később, a pakli keverése után jöhet elő, a mérgezés később bekövetkező hatását szimulálva.
Éjszaka/nappal váltakozásának bevezetése is érdekes volt számomra: éjszaka könnyebben közlekedünk a sivatagban, ám nehezebben a bozótos erdőben.
Pár egyéni tanulójáték után mertem csak belevágni, hogy másnak is bemutassam a játékot: 14 éves fiam érzett kedvet a kipróbálásra. Nehezen indult be a játék, de 4. fordulótól kezdve már ő is olyan kombókkal nyomta le az ellenségeket, hogy csak néztem.
Sajnos hosszú a tanulási folyamata, mindenkinek magától kell rájönnie, hogy milyen áldozatokat kell hozni: a lapokat néha be kell áldozni, sérülések nélkül nem lehet fejlődni.
A lapok variálhatósága miatt nagyon AP veszélyes, de ezt a szerző is érezte, a szabálykönyv is ki tér rá - miszerint jobban járunk, ha engedjük a kártyák kijátszásának próbálgatását, ha nem történt semmi visszavonhatatlan a játékban engedjük meg a lépések a játékos körében való tervezgetését a játék gyorsítása végett. Én szeretem figyelni a másik játékos lépésének alakulgatását, én végig élveztem a játékot!
Azt hiszem, a legjobb egyedül játszható társasjátékom, élvezhetőek a küldetések szóló módban is, bár egy picit más, rohanósabb stratégiát követel az általam eddig lejátszottak.
Nagyon nagy kedvenc!

I made the commitment to work through the rules and get comfortable with the gameplay.  I'm very happy with the choices I have to make as I puzzle through the game.  It's a keeper as a solo option.

This could easily rise in my ratings with more plays

Update 1/27/2016
Finally pulled this off the shelf after 2 years between plays....TWO YEARS!  Set it up on the table and asked myself "What was I thinking waiting so long"?  

I needed to brush up on the rules nuances again, but this game is a beautiful solo experience.  There is really no need to even carve out two contiguous hours to play, either as I can leave it set up on the table multiple days.  The nature of the game on the table takes care of the bookkeeping.

I have roughly 150 games, but this is most definitely among the top 5.  And....when I look at a solo experience (whether I win or lose) Mage Knight and Robinson Crusoe are my prized options.

Between this and Through The Ages, Chvatil has cemented himself as the new Richard Hamblen / Francis Tresham / Don Greenwood... a standard-bearer for the hobby and an influence that will affect decades of game designs to come. 

Nothing until Chvatil's two breakout hits had even come close to rivaling the old AH Civ or Magic Realm for pure scope and intensity. Through The Ages and Mage Knight do without question. All Vlaada needs now is a train game.

Watching Ricky Royal's walk through and solo conquest videos (Box of Delights) really helped me get up to speed more quickly. Still, I had to use the rulebook quite a bit during the first game. 

Played 3 games thus far, 1 Recon and 2 solo conquest. I lost the first solo conquest but won the 2nd with 150 points. Maximizing the effectiveness of your hand is key, that and not being afraid to take wounds. 

After my first game I wasn't sure if I had made the right decision purchasing this game, but once you become more familiar with the rules and your options, it really starts to shine.  

Edit 1: After many more plays I am upgrading this from 8.5 to 9. It is a bit fiddly but a fantastic journey none the less.

This is a game for those who enjoy planning, strategizing, and optimizing each turn. If you are looking for a quick hack 'n' slash dungeon crawler this is not the game for you.

Great solo experience! Avoid playing with those who suffer from AP unless you have infinite patience.

Edit 2: Updating my score to 9.5. I absolutely LOVE this game.

Played this game solo for the first time. I really enjoyed it, just have to work a bit to keep track of the rules. I think I could get some members of my gaming group to play, but I feel I need to really have a good grasp on the game before I do. The game is a little tedious to set up, sorting out the different piles of cards, getting things laid out right, but it does make the game go smoother if you have it laid out. Managing your card deck is really important. Waiting and timing your moves when you have the right cards in your hand can make a huge difference. There is a bit of luck, but strategy can really help you win this game.

A tough slog learning the rules, but worth it. The fog slowly clears to reveal an excellent game. Every rule and mechanism is there to support the theme, and once memorised, it all makes sense. Probably wouldn't recommend more than 3 players unless you have 5 hours to spare. Also be prepared to play it incorrectly the first few times. Rick Royal's Box of Delights videos are a must watch if you want to learn this game. It's a lengthy, complex game, and can be frustrating if you draw move cards when you want influence or attack, or influence cards when you want to move. At its core its about making the best of your hand and using cards optimally. Combat takes a while to understand. Mana crystals powering up cards is an awesome touch.

One of the best solo games out there. I played this almost every day for an entire summer. After awhile, however, it's pretty apparent that this game plays out very similarly each time. I miss it from time to time, but it's a little too complex for what it needs to be.

UPDATE: I now own Star Trek Frontiers, which means that this game is probably now and forever gone from my collection.

I have only played this game solo, but have found that it has been a great solution to getting a pen and paper game like fix in its depth and complexity without needing to schedule and coordinate large blocks of time to play with others in a P&P (don't confuse with me meaning the game doesn't take a long time). Understanding that the weight of the game may put players off, I approached much more like the P&P games in that there would be a lot of rules and mechanics to learn. I fully understand why there is so much hype behind this game as THE board game for solo play and I can pull it out at my convenience. Fantastic game.

RATING: 7.5
Is a good game. A good rpg in a form of board game. But if you want something with interaction between players you may forget it. Maybe this is only because of the introduction scenario. Will see. First game can be exhaustive, but since the decks are small and they growth very slow, in the end of the first turn you already know almost all cards turning the game much easier and quick.
Its fun.

RATING: 2
You don't 'adventure' in this game. You calculate and number crunch each turn. A solid argument could be made that you're not actually 'playing' a game at all, since mechanics in the game lend themselves towards removing player agency.

Lack of suspense. Lack of meaningful options. Lack of agency. This 'best solo game ever' is anything but.

The rules do the game a diservice. This man needs a rules writer. On the other hand this might very well be my favorite game. I like solo gaming but find I prefer shorter games like Onirim and Friday for that purpose.

The first game we have, a joint-stock one indeed, so lots of memories. All the art and the minis are well-designed, tempting theme, and of course, fun to play.

It is not that there is no competitive mode, but it is just too vague that we rarely play. The combat system might be a little heavy at first sight.

Can board games and roleplaying games be combined? Not if you judge the negative reviews, that complain about a long and fiddly gameplay with a mishmash of mechanisms and lots of downtime. Given that I'm not normally fond of cooperative games and card drafting games, I doubt I would find this interesting, although I may at least give Mage Knights a try.

I should have liked this game way more than I did. I'm a huge fantasy/D&D nut. The game looks great and has lots of innovative ideas, but is way too fiddly and long-winded for me. Sometimes, a Euro with an Ameritrash theme does neither genre any favors.

I know people love this game, but I'm not one of them.

Absolutely a great game. It gives strongly the theme and you feel that your character is getting stronger every turn. A little complex with the rules on the first plays but after 2-3 games it gets easy to understand. Very difficult choices to make, as far as the best use of your cards so you can take the best out of them every round. Cool mechanics, great components and above all enough replayability, as every game will not be the same depending on how you chose to develop your Mage Knight and the different scenarios. Not quite a strategy game but more of a tactic game. One of my top 5 games in my collection. Well done!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably my most demanding game. It's very rare for me to get the opportunity to play this. You need players who can sit down for many hours and digest the complicated rules.

But when you can play it, it's very fun! It feels a lot like Heroes of Might and Magic. You travel across the land, collect treasures and fight monsters. Each turn is like a puzzle trying to figure out the best way to use the cards in your hand to achieve something. And it's so rewarding to get better at it and watch your hero cut a path through their foes.

Watch out for the risk of downtime here. It's probably best to stick to a small number of players to keep it running smoothly.

Amazing game - you feel like you're acomplishing something, you know?
Great mechanics and reward system. Once you start playing, grab yourself some snacks and beverages because you're in for a few hour of fun. I mean, real fun.
You collect the spells and actions and recruit some powerful allies... it's quite a journey.

Review here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/762682/ninjadorgs-obligatory-my-first-solo-conquest-post

EDIT - took nearly 5 months but Tovak finally arrived.

Awful customer service from Wizkids - I've been waiting over three months for a Tovak figure, which did not come with the game.  The second printing has gone ahead but they still can't fulfil the needs of those who bought the first printing.  But for the game itself...

This game is in my head all the time right now, can't stop thinking about it and playing 2 or 3 solo games a night in anticipation of another multiplayer session when I get the opportunity.  Although abstract and mathematical or 'Euro-y' this has fast become one of my favourite games of all time.

Still learning the rules as I go.  Makes me wonder if I'm ready to get stuck back into Magic Realm again now...


UPDATE 15/01/14:

This is another long, long game, and one session of it took all night, a session which I won fairly decisively.  Sam played Krang and I played Wolfhawk and we played a standard Conquest game with all the new stuff shuffled in but none of the new scenarios and no Volkare.
It has to be said, I love Mage Knight.  The wealth of decisions, the way the world randomly populates as it goes, the effects of terrain, the varying encounters, reputation, influence, the deck building and levelling up – it all adds up to a really intricate and detailed package, with tons of brain burning decisions to be made every turn.  Thematically I’m not fond of it all taking place over just three days, I’d prefer it if each action represented a day or something, and I’m not familiar with, nor very interested in, the MK world, but these are very small complaints.  Between this and TtA I became a huge Vlaada fanboy, and that led to my impulse purchase of Dungeon Lords, which I still haven’t yet tried.  As a solo game, Mage Knight is pretty peerless.  As a multiplayer game, as Sam rightly pointed out, it’s a lot like you’re playing different games on the same board at the same time.  Outside of PvP, much like Runebound – though a far superior game to Runebound - there’s little else you can do to influence each other, and the PvP is of no real interest.  I get that the threat of it might add an edge to the game or whatever, but if you come to blows in a two player game like this it’s going to seriously affect the rest of the game one way or another.  Next time we’ll play one of the cooperative Volkare scenarios instead.

My comments are overdue, but recent experience with Star Wars Imperial Assault, Myth, and Mice & Mystics has made me realize that not only is Mage Knight an excellent deck building game, strategy game, and satisfying puzzle; it is also the best dudes in a hallway game.  In fact, Mage Knight is arguably the best deck building game, a genre I really enjoy.  It has more competition in the strategy game department, but it is easily top ten.  And this game is one of the top 5 solitaire games I own.  Incredible.  Yes, it is fiddly.  Yes the rules could be better organized.  But the effort expended is rewarded in spades.  I also really appreciate that this game is fun for two to four newbies who will grow in their capabilities in this game over time, but will enjoy a balanced experience in the beginning.  I also appreciate that the solo experience gives you a challenge to simply just play well, but also challenges you to be so perfect in your problem solving skills that you will eventually have to take on more creatures with only five cards than it ever seems possible to do.  If you like solo games that stack the deck against you, but appreciate a game that allows you to build up your skill at a game along side others, with a score card for how each of you are progressing, you will love Mage Knight.  Oh, and if you find yourself behind one of your peers in your quest to improve, you can always just attack them to let some steam off.

Another Vlaada hit. Can't wait to play it again.
After one more game, I have to say that this game replaces Runebound for me. The only think I like more about runebound is the expansions, but I think Mage Knight will get planty of those in the near future.

This game is like nothing I've played before, and I'm really liking it!

This is no 4 player game. 3 is the best number of players to enjoy it. I think 4 players games last too long.

I have played this a couple of times and I rate it a 7.  Now this is due to the accessibility issues with the game, that is my perspective enjoyment value from playing this game again.  If I owned it I expect that would go up again and again with repeated plays.  The time taken to play initially makes a huge barrier to entry.

I have seen this game explained as a series of puzzles to be solved by the player/s.  Initially however it is like trying to do a jigsaw in the dark where you don't know what pieces you are even working with or the shape you are trying to make.

Thre player game on first play. The game ran kinda slow and there was some down time. What the different things do on the map and the abilities are a bunch of wierd stuff too, BUT I so look forward to having my copy arrive as I think this game really shines in solo and 2 player as well.

The game shows a lot of promise and dispite the many rules, I think this is a good game.


Second playthrough was the solitaire version.

I now can see that playing with 4 players is going to be a problem. I love the game and would probably rate it a 10, but it has 2 major problems and a minor one, one of which is fixable.

The minor one is the rulebooks, they're a mess and why do I have to read the same things twice?

The major ones: Only one solitaire scenario? I'll probably make up my own or look for resources on the net, but come on... 1-4 players and only 1 solitaire scenario?

second major issue, which for me makes sure that this game will never go higher than 9. Timeconsumption of calculating playes is too big. This is also why I like this game, but a reason that I'll never play with 4 players, maybe not even 3. This is unfixable, but also one of its charms

As a mage knight, players move around terrain to attack monsters, influence units, or explore different dwellings. Each player has their own deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, they are virtually the same except for one card. You can then acquire spell cards, or other special cards, and wound cards (which fill up your hand) as the game evolves.

I enjoyed my one and half plays of this. I like solving problems, and I have barely scratched the surface of this game. I'm hoping to get in more plays of this game, but part of the problem is trying to find the time. I suspect like all good games, the rating will rise with more plays.

This is a board game review:

We completed our first play-through of MageKnight the board game, and I have to say it really lives up to our hopes and expectations from the designer of "Space Alert". 

The game if fun and fast-paced despite being long. It's mechanics are elegant and interesting. The systems are thematic, the components are beautiful, and the combination of tried and true game mechanics with a deck-building twist is satisfying and interesting. Despite random elements, no player will win based on luck because the volume and depth of meaningful strategic decisions is so high--furthermore because of the way turns are spaced out, similar in elegance to War of the Ring, there is less "analysis paralysis" that many games of such complexity will suffer from--hence the fast pace.

It's an open world adventure game--I think of them as MMOs from beginning to end in one box and one sitting similar to Talisman, Runebound or WOW the board games. Based on my research and experience, it's better and more gratifying than all of these games and though I'm excited to try more of this genre including "Prophecy" and "The Magic Realm", I already anticipate that Mageknight will be the new and long-standing champion in the open world adventure fantasy genre (To distinguish this from a dungeon-crawl fantasy)

Unlike other fantasy worlds, this one feels truly original and interesting, the setting is interesting and dynamic and the replay-ability is extremely high.

Really interesting the way that each individual turn in this game is like a puzzle, trying to work out what your character can achieve with the hand you've drawn (from a deck you build as you go on).

I'm interested in playing this one some more. So far it does feel a little long, but hopefully as players get more experienced the length will come down a little and it'll pack a decent 'fantasy quest' experience.

Too complicated at 4.0+ weight and also very long at 2.5 hours, so even though its the best solo game, its probably too involved and time consuming esp for its setup time and frontloaded terms and things. May prefer to just play a computer game than this.

Taking off my WTP since I only want my WTP to be games Id consider buying in the future.

When asked what a joke name for this would be, many players said "pass me the rulebook" even 5 games in because its so complicated/convoluted. Theres even a procedure to rewind steps in case you mess up, and theres a lot of thinking involved in just moving from what I heard. Makes me very unwilling to get this, even if its the best solo board game. Id like something much simpler and shorter if possible.

I really enjoy this game. It's the most fun game of its genre that I've played (fantasy adventure with questing and leveling up and such), and it works really well.

I do have two complaints about the game:

1. The game takes too long to setup and play. It's a whole evening affair. There are just so many pieces to it and no easy way (that I've found) to make it go faster.

2. The rulebook and gameplay lack Vlaada's signature humor.

Great looking game, full of strategy and packed with adventure. The rules are infinite, but never illogical. It's my game for lonely days.

The difficulty of explaining the rules and, more than that, the lack of improvements in playing it with more people, make this game a 7. Also, replayability is not that strong here. Yes, you'll never get the same set of cards two times. Every time you play it, however, you'll tend to live the same experiences. Due to the size of the game, it's not that much of a problem.

Love the puzzle fights, scenarios, art of cards,card driven mechanics... For me this is easily the best Vlaada's game so far...fun, fun and fun.

I keep coming back to this game hoping I'll enjoy it, but after the long set up and the first couple of moves I get incredibly bored and end up packing it back up. 

The game has so much going for it and nothing really shines. On paper the mechanics are everything I love, but together it just becomes a hot mess.

The game itself as a game designed by a human being is absolutely amazing. The mechanics, the moving parts, the decisions: all top notch.

The issue is that I honestly don't know if I enjoy playing the game. Setup can take forever, some rules are just north of too obscure for what they do (PC has ice block which blocks fire attacks, enemies have ice resistance which halves ice attacks), and a bad start can leave you completely crippled (rarely, but it's there). 

I guess I want to like it more than I do, but have to recognize just how amazing of a design it is. Hence the 8.

My favourite game. Watched Ricky Royals playthroughs and out it on my wish list. My wife bought it me for Christmas. Absolutely fell in love with it on my first play. So rich, thematic, and engrossing. If I have three hours to myself, this is the game I will play, every time.

Played it 2p once - just the tutorial.  Love it solo though.

Added Lost Legion which improved it even more with added variety and some new play modes.

I didn't get as much of a sense of exploration from this game as I wanted, and wish there was some kind of personal goal or questing system that would give you additional goals.
However, it's a very well designed system and those nits are really just flaws in my expectations rather than problems in the game.

One thing that is an issue for me is the time and complexity. Games take a lot of table space and a lot of time, and I'm not sure the payoff is sufficient for me. I also tend to like a bit more risk-management in my solo games, where many things in this game feel deterministic based on your hand of cards at any given moment.

Probably won't stay in my collection, but a fine game that might appeal to others more than it does to me.

First full game was a wreck. Spent 3.5 hours building up my character, feeling relatively powerful, then thrown onto the ground by the defenders of the first city. There was simply nothing I could do to make a dent, and that was wildly demotivating. I will give it a few more shots, but that first impression was rough.

While I thoroughly enjoyed it, my first play did take a long time. I may have trouble getting this one to the table.

Update: PLayed 4-player and had a blast. This is a very fun game with a mixture of mechanics. RPG, deckbuilder, exploration, modular board, and a fantasy theme. I love it. 

UpdaTE: played 4-player full conquest for the first time with 2 rookies. I still love this game, but we played for ~7 hours and only got through the fourth round, at which point we quit. 

Update 6/8/2014 - Still love this game, my only wish is that it could be somehow significantly shorter and still fun.

RATING: 10
After the initial learning curve, everything clicks into place. Thematically robust - adventuring, combat, NPC interaction. 

Every hand is like a puzzle, and each victory satisfying. Master map movement and manage your mana. Bring down the toughest of foes with a timely spell or powerful artifact. Refresh your army of mercenaries as old ones die in battle. 

This game is truly a masterpiece. Solo game is where it's at. 2-3 players for co-op mayhem. Not recommended for 4+ players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Great take on fantasy themed demolition derbies to level-up  as efficiently as possible with a hand management engine and goût du jour deckbuilding seasoning. Cards basically have different colors to represent attacking/blocking, moving/shooting, healing/boosting and interacting/money or can be laid sideways to give +1 modifiers to said actions.

Since there's no odds when performing deterministic actions with open information, risk vs reward decision making is replaced by binary "yes/automatic" or "no/impossible" processing. Mostly, you'll be searching for a bunch of arbitrary rules that may apply to your situation, get your head around as many exceptions for sake of convolution and so, ponder for ages before doing anything any given turn. Adding more friends to the table accordingly adds hours of downtime and proportional chances of walking through a cleaned-up map. To speed this bloated game up, the author suggests planning ahead (really?) and playing at the same time... even though you do buy cards from the same offer, pick mana dice from the same pool and a couple nasty skills directly alter your opponent's movement or deck, not mentioning it isn't calculating but searching for the right freakin' double sided reference card and ruling out what you can and can't do that takes time, not resolving your risk free action! And there's even a backtrack rule that allows the real active player to redo his whole turn from the start, yay!

Besides dispensable day & night cards, the wound mechanic was a neat idea to hinder possibilities before experiencing how limited your possibilities are any given time. With only a single different card per deck, knights are obviously empty shells so they surely are balanced? Try winning against porn actor Goldix or his battle thonged babe Arythea. At least, you'll have the pleasure of leading armies of powerful golems, arcane mages and the likes that will serve once then as meat shields. Mostly though, you'll try to desperately move your lazy ass a couple hexes a turn and go on adventures without narrative, wishing to discover easy orcs on accessible terrain, drawing the right cards at the right time, entering villages and monasteries that will offer the same companions and upgraded actions as any other on the map.

Played a 2-player in co-op mode and found it fun and involving, but it wasn't exactly clear whether or not we had interpreted the combat phases correctly. The game takes quite a while to play because, in addition to AP, the resolution of combat is so lengthy. As well, the resource chaining calculations you have to make are just complex enough to invite mistakes. A strong title, an interesting choice for top 10.

RATING: 9.9
A rare beast. It is, at first blush, simply a beast. Its alarmingly long rule-set is filled with finicky exceptions. Its tabletop footprint is gigantic. It presents an intimidating menu of choices at every turn. And plan on setting aside 4-6 hours to play the solitaire game at a leisurely pace.

Yet though the barrier to entry is high, the riches to be found are greater still. Mage Knight performs the most dazzling feat of balance of any game I know. The countless possibilities are calibrated with extraordinary delicacy. As a result, despite the game's complexity and its many sources of chance - card shuffles, tile draws, dice rolls - the game is almost purely one of skill. But somehow none of this comes at the expense of thematic immersion. All of the moving parts in this dense strategic masterpiece make good thematic sense, leaving you with the feeling of a powerful Mage Knight exploring the land and conquering ever more terrifying foes.

Mage Knight is the tabletop equivalent of War and Peace: grand, challenging, and immensely satisfying.

RATING: 7
I really like the idea here of deckbuilding your arsenal and exploring, conquering and collecting better stuff. The theme is great too. So all the elements were there for me to like it.

The problem comes when you try to play it! Each turn is a long solo optimisation puzzle. It's bad enough when it's your turn, as you AP up trying different permutations of cards, only to discover that you can't do what you want and then have to repeat the process for a lesser enemy. But when it's someone else's turn, it's much worse! And without PvP there's virtually no interaction of any kind - I can see why it's so recommended as a solo game.

The components and rules are insanely fiddly too - I constantly had to ask what each hex or monster did as they came up.

I can't imagine playing this game with more than 2 people, as my one 2p play took 5 hours. And with it being multiplayer solitaire, I'd struggle to find a reason to even play with 2. As I'd rather play multiplayer against AIs when alone, I can't see myself playing this much - a shame, because it has huge promise.

I won't slobber all over the game praising it like some will, but it is a great solo experience. Yes, the three hour play time limits its time on the gaming table but I look forward to those Saturday nights when it's just me and MK. It's complicated but I think the rules' notoriety is a bit overblown. Don't stress about getting every rule right; maybe I get that from playing so much Advanced Squad Leader.

   The ultimate game experience thus far. It is complete in every way. Game play , art, components… everything. Solo , co op or competitive make a little difference. I enjoyed it in all three modes. Some can say time length is on the down side but it is worth it. (if you have it). The amazing thing is that I never, ever, not once thought ‘’this is taking for ever’’. Instead I am always up for one more… Oh and one more thing… The Lost Legion… Dear God!!!!!

I'm always hesitant to rate something so high after a couple introductory plays, but this really scratches all the right itches for me: co-op, solo, high fantasy, single-character, mathy, puzzly. Eking the most out of a terrible hand is exhilarating.

That said--it's long. I don't know if I'd ever want to play with more than 1 or 2. I'm even bugged by my OWN AP in this game. Also, the dummy player is inelegant and stupid. Why not just have a simple game timer, maybe using the dice to vary round length a little?

I like that it is a 1-4 player game, although the more players you add, the longer the downtime between plays.

Also, if you're going to play solo, I would recommend the iPhone app that tracks the solo player.  It makes it a lot easier.

It is hard to describe how addictive this games is.  After playing the walkthrough scenario, 3 of us played the next scenario.  The next thing we know, it is 9 hours later, 2:30am, and we don't want to stop.  After a brief sleep break, it was back at the board the next day and the day after that.

Very fun.  It constantly leaves you with the impression that you are just a turn away from blowing your opponents away, but that miracle turn rarely comes about.  By the end of the game, when points are totaled, the winner is often a surprise, which only adds to the fun.

Very heavy fantasy game that uses deck building to determine your actions for the round. I love it but it is very thinky. Great twist on the fantasy genre with euro esque mechanisms. I love the puzzle of maximizing your hand of cards each turn and the experience/leveling up system feels like you are getting slightly stronger with each level. Interesting use of deck building as a mechanism instead of the whole game. Recommended for the hard core gamer with an interest in the fantasy genre. Solid 2-player game. Probably wouldn't play with more due to downtime.

Really wanted to like this one; it's the only game I can think of that has a randomly generated map each time with a true feeling of an adventure, so it's such a shame that the mechanisms were so clunky, so counter-intuitive and so complicated that it nobody enjoyed it. Random cards to move? 

I get the sense that the game was created with "trying something new" in mind, or that there was no previous research done into other adventure games because those rules were just bonkers.

I would say that this plays best as a solo game. 
With more players the thing you gain is the minor co-op factor or the competition factor. But it is not needed as such. Adding more players only adds to the downtime and the AP, I dont recommend it.

From my experience, I would therefore say that this game is best played solo, with a dummy player that is handled by some excellent in-game rules.
Great game, at least to me. 

My rating is based on solo play, for multiplayer subtract 2 from my score.

RATING: 9
A tough to egg to crack initially, but once I found my stride with the game it really became a strong favorite. The core scope of the rules are fairly intuitive but there are a very high degree of situational conditions that can affect how you calculate or determine the effect of your actions which seems to be the hurdle that throws many from this game initially.

To really "get" this game it is best learned from others, or by following the great Youtube walk-through videos put out by people such as Ricky Royal. After that process the game really blossoms and you are left with a very engaging adventure game that consistently causes you to puzzle out every inch of your options making even solo play an engrossing experience.

The main fault I have with the game however is the overall lack of real narrative or any storytelling quality. There is no quest framework or flavor text to add anything to the theme besides the card art and what you are actually doing during the game play itself. This lends a little bit of isolation to the world you are traveling around in, and it sometimes feels a little flat in that sense.

Rating after one introductory scenario game.

Just, wow. This game has everything you could want in an adventure-style game but does it up in an easy to grasp, engaging manner. Lots of rules but so far they all seem pretty manageable.

I can't wait to play a 'real' game. I suspect this will become a 10, as long as those I play with keep their rate of play reasonable since downtime might be the only thing that grates a little.

*** Update after 20 plays ***

Well, it's a 10 for me as expected. Astonishingly thematic and well designed. The mass of rules have caught me more than once (there are a few too many special cases and exceptions for my liking, to be honest) but once you get it down you've got it down.

I really, really love how your character gradually becomes able to accomplish far more impressive feats over the course of the game. That Orc you had trouble with in the early game becomes roadkill to be nonchalantly swatted aside in the late game...

Cannot wait for expansions.

This is one of the games I've waited my whole life for.  I normally hate games where you go around killing things and getting xp because they are normally dice rolling and luck based.  This one isnt.  It combines the best bits of other games, gels them all well together.

It has well constructed game mechanics, a very clever combat mechanic which acts as a kind of puzzle.  The replayability is the best I have ever seen in a game.  You can play this game competitively, coop, solo.  You can choose whether to turn on Player vs Player combat or not.  The game comes packed with 11 scenarios and multiple variant rules already built in that you really can play this game however you want to.

Play time can be a turn off, because this game has a big rulebook and is moderately complex.  And a full first game might take about 6 hours, but the play time drops drastically with each play, coming down to 3-4 hours.

Epic game.  Thankyou Vlaada.

Unfortunately, some players of the original Mage Knight game are going to rate this game poorly because it isnt anything like the original game.  Oh look, there we are, someone has already rated the game low although he has never played it and doesnt know anything about it but is upset that he cant use his old Mage Knight figures :)

Need to play it more. Has lots of depth and potential. Played the first introduction scenario. It felt like just 'doing something', with (too) much goal oriented actions and (too) many new rules everytime an enemy is discovered. A more advanced scenario (now the basic rules are understood) in a coop scenario might be more exciting. Lots of rules and exceptions, so high learning curve during the first play.

With four there was too much downtime (though it was our first game), mainly because [u]everything[/u] can be calculated, and often not in advance. But with just two the downtime wasn't too bad, even with two AP prone players, and the game progressed much better.

Needs couple of more plays before rating.

RATING: 9.5
Astonishing, sprawling game. Licks all the spots in my brain that Magic Realm did, but in 1/10th of the time and in a much, much flashier package. Some deckbuilding elements, a beautiful presentation, intriguing and intricate gameplay.

9.8 based on one solitaire play. Looking forward to multiplayer. May become my next 10.

EDIT: Upon many plays, dropping oh-so-slightly to a 9.5. My 0.3 reduction is due only to longish downtime during multiplayer games. It may go up yet again once we add PvP rules and, possibly, "interactive combat" rules atop that. The full-meal-deal I believe is going to bring my rating back up.

A beast of a set of rules. Game play is actually a mixture of simplicity (just play your cards out) amidst a complex wealth of options, both in the number of things you can do on the board and in how you play your cards out. So the game is overwhelming at first with the number of things that can and will appear in a game that you need to have your head around. Once that's done, it should devolve into a decent romp around the countryside whacking things for fame and VPs.

Holy Learning Curves, Batman!! Feels more like an RPG more than any other board game I've played yet. Vlaada Chvátil's heaviest game, as far as I know. Though this game is overwhelming in learning it, the reason I'm not giving up on it is that I can't stop thinking about it!!!

Cool Epic Game. Gamer's Game. Long game. Particular rules. But Good Game.

I'm glad for good people in the forums to answer any and all questions we might have, because rules are easy to miss for those who have trouble memorizing epic rules. The Walkthrough is an excellent teaching tool. The regular rulebook has so much that it's not so easy to find things quickly. The site cards and rules are very useful, but I prefer something larger. However, rules can be found when searched long enough.

RATING: 7
"As people say, this is a complicated, puzzley adventure game. I wish the co-op scenarios had more cooperation. And I wish it were streamlined by 30%, which is what I tend to say about Vlaada games."

What I like:
- Fantasy theme with great components, including the modular board tiles
- Deterministic combat
- Sense of exploration
- Offers solo and a couple cooperative scenarios
- Box is appropriately sized

What I don't like:
- Could be streamlined by 30% without losing much
- Long, and takes up a lot of space on the table
- Co-op scenarios don't look that interesting
- Co-op mode doesn't offer many chances to actually cooperate
- The theme is a bit dark at times (e.g. burning down monasteries) 

When I say this could be streamlined, I'm thinking we don't really need ruins and mines and spawn points and dungeons. We don't really need artifacts or advanced units. In solo and co-op mode, we don't need tactic cards. Having night and day modes is of marginal value. We could live with half as many combat modifiers.

All of those things could be in expansions, leaving the base game to be far more accessible, and much shorter (especially with important learning/teaching games). With everything, the game isn't "too complicated", but it does feel needlessly complicated, to me (and many others, apparently). I would put the weight around 3.5.

RATING: 2
Too intimidating for anyone but hard core gamers. Supremely overrated. Not fun. Akin to wearing hip waders and walking through quicksand. Requires serious and constant rulebook study while playing. In spite of the density, I found the RACE to finish a scenario in time (3 days/nights) wholly unsatisfying and rushed and the end goal supremely boring and cliched. Everything was visible. Never felt I was on an adventure full of surprises. 

 Once I failed to conquer the castle, I had no urge to try and slog through the quicksand again. I prefer fantasy games with more surprises, a sense of adventure while exploring and a more casual pace. Even Arabian nights is more enjoyable for us. This is a gigantic puzzle and turns take far too long to figure out, even as two player, and include too many rules exceptions and clauses and constant references to the rulebook to make sure you didn't miss one of fifty important details. All work and no fun. 

 thought I might love this as a solo game, but in a year of it sitting on my shelf, I cannot muster the drive to relearn the game and attempt it. It's a job, not pleasure. This game reaffirmed that solo play goes against the concept of fun gaming for me. I like to socialize in a game. If I want to play solo, there are a million video games that offer more pleasure than this. 

Mage knight is a game that might have worked before electricity, books, TV, Internet, masturbation, were invented, when people had nothing to do but farm the land until exhausted then come home and play a game by candlelight...no wait, no one would have the energy to learn and play mage knight after working a full time job. It's for people in prison, who have a lot of time...no, wait, they could be bouncing a ball against the wall or doing push-ups, both much more satisfying and entertaining pastimes.  I suppose if I was stranded on a desert island with nothing to do all day...no, wait, I'd rather talk to a soccer ball.

This reminds me of Runebound from the "sandbox" style adventuring as you can go wherever you want on the board, but the small deck-building part separates the two games. The card combos and mana use (tokens and dice) can vary from game to game along with different scenarios to keep it fresh. It would be difficult for me to choose between RB and MK if I could only play one.

2/19/12 - Mage Knight feels like an epic campaign in a board game format. The only similarities it has to the old clix based game of yore is the name. Tiles are flipped as you explore the landscape with monsters, keeps, towers and cities to help you gain new abilities and level up. Chits are used  show your level and powers. Cards from a personal deck are used to resolve everything and you can customize it by acquiring new cards in a market.

The only warning I offer is this, Mage Knight is a long game. My 4 player game took over 5 hours with rule explanation but it never seemed to drag nor did I wait long for my turn.

I like the ability to take time over your moves and the oh so difficult decisions as to how to use your cards.
Mainly solo which works well. Played a couple vassal games which are totally different and work really well.
Not sure how well it would work face2face due to AP as you need to always maximise your card play.

Update (12.09.2016):
This game is just so good, that I wan't to come back to it again and again. Even the long playing time doesn't bother me too much. I just wan't to organize another event for this "experience game" once again. I raise my rating (10). Wonderfull!!!
Update (04.2013):
I raised my rating (9) after the last few plays I had with this game! This game just keeps better and better as I play it, there is SO much to explore and so much depth with it it is unbelievable. I love to explore the different Mage Knights and how they play. I love to play different scenarios. I love the PvE gameplay. Still havent tried the PvP scenarios. There is still so much to learn before I can even think of trying them. Wonderfull. It remains a very timeconsuming affair but I am really looking foreward in playing this again. Would have never thought this to happen, because I normally like shorter games better.
(first post):
This is a preliminary rating (8) because I have to play this more before being able to decide on its final rating. This game is really complex as there are myriads of possibilites the players may follow throughout the game. Game length and AP is a problem. Still I keep thinking about this game.

15+ plays - ZOMG... one of my favourite games. You explore, you slay, you get rewarded and become famous. There's a very special feeling when you level up or seize an artifact! Putting newly earned specialty moves on the top of your deck (knowing its the next card you will draw) never gets old! As per other comments, there is a learning curve which will continue across a few play-throughs. IMO however, once you've 'got it', its not really rocket science. I've enjoyed every play through, even when later I realised I got something wrong. So what? It was a ton of fun.  

Unfortunately, this is a solo game or two player at most. While I rarely solo game, this is definitely one that beats playing a video game in my spare time!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm excited - lots of options to take, deck building, strong fantasy theme ... great.
On the other hand - a bit long due to AP with inexperienced players (normal 2 player scenario roughly 4-5h) - and I don't know if I play this often enough with different players for all of them to get experience.
Interaction isn't that high, at least for the non player-to-player-combat scenarios, and those I have not done so far.
But, und this is a big but:
simply the best solo experience I had. Ever. Can't wait to play it again.

I've played it once with 4 players and the game lasted forever and the gameplay was not very exciting.

Based on one play: This is like an RPG in a board game, but be warned there is a lot going on here and the game can seem a little finicky especially during battles as you try to determine how to kill off a monster with spells, crystals, skills, power up, recruits and other abilities. Nevertheless, it is quite interesting and although I would need to play again, you can see that a lot of work was put into this in order to make sure it is balanced and fun.

I actually quite liked the game. The exploration was great, I thought the wound mechanic was nicely implemented, and I loved the reputation. A lot of good things going for it.

What I didn't like was how strong some of the enemies were. Many times, I just had to flee and I knew I would never be able to deal with them. It always seemed that I didn't have the right cards in my hand. I was always drawing my reputation cards when I needed to move, or my movement cards wehen I needed to fight, and it left me hurting many times.
What I just really didn't like about the game is that it took forever. Our game took like 10 hours, and after investing so much time, I just had to look at the board and think "...is that it? We spent 10 hours and I managed to walk like 10 spaces and get into a few fights?..." If the game really only lasted up to 4 hours, I don't think I would have minded so much, but none of us were really slow or anything, so that wouldn't be achievable unless we were super familiar with the game and could make snapshot turns.

We played a competitive game without pvp, and to me, it just felt like a race as to who could snipe the locations first. In the end, I would much rather play cooperative or completely competitive with pvp. I do feel that this would be an amazing solo game.

This is likely a very good game.  The problem I have with it is that every time I sit down to read the manual, I end up falling asleep.  Honestly, just boring to read through.

Great game with many options for playing card combinations. I can really see why it takes so long to play as you can easily spend 10 minutes trying to figure out the best way to play your cards to accomplish something. This is in no way a knock on Mage Knight but if you are looking for a 2 - 3 hour game, this probably isn't for you. All in all I can recommend this game if you like deep thinking games with lots of options and dripping with theme. Also plays great Solo which is a huge plus for me.

Fired Middle Earth Quest and is one of the few deckbuilders that work for me! 27/12/14

Update: not sure this one merits a 10 now after my last play. Still an excellent game. The rules fiddliness is starting to get under my skin a little a bit like Earth Reborn. Still a majestic design. Rerated to a 9. 18/1/2015

Update: I think I need to settle on an 8 here. The game is still well designed but not as fun as some of the other games I want to get to the table. It is a bit long too. 7/2/2015

Update: I really don't think I will be putting this on the table again. I mean it is worth a 7 (Good) as far as my review ratings go but wanting to play wise (how the Geek admin want us to rate games) it is down to a 6 - will play if in the right mood. Ouch. I've actually sold my copy this week. It is no longer a sacred cow lol 5/3/15

OK now this is at a 4 simply because I'd be happy not to have to play this again.

This is the game that got me into the hobby. Finding myself without gaming friends, I was looking for a non-video game solo experience. I saw the Starlight Citadel review of Mage Knight, and knew I had to have it. It's truly a thing of beauty. Not just the components, but the rule set itself is just a work of art. The whole thing screams Ameritrash, but I get a very euro feel due to the puzzle-like nature of the resource management each turn throws in your face. Believe the hype. This is the real deal.

Real cool stuff here, excellent dungeon crawl type game with smart mechanics and nice components. I love that it comes with pre-painted minis. The hand management aspect is nice.

Despite the innovation, this game still very much has the feel of an adventure game, like Runebound.  Mage Knight adds a deckbuilding component to the game, where players start out with somewhat different decks that represent what their character can do, and can add to it as the game goes on.  Additionally, newly-acquired cards go on top of your deck, meaning that you'll be able to use them once before the vagaries of shuffling.  Normal CCG-fu doesn't really work here, as you don't want to burn through your deck as quickly as possible--if you deplete your deck first you'll get fewer turns than your opponents.  There are a ton of little fiddly rules everywhere, but after a couple of plays, things started to sink in pretty well.  What's neat about the game is the variability in card play--you have a ton of options, and often you can come up with a really impressive turn; it just feels satisfying.  In this case, I think the large rules overhead is worth it.

[b]Update:[/b] Alright, after quite a few more plays of this game, I can honestly say it is absolutely amazing. I don't know why I didn't try bringing this back out sooner. The game always presents an interesting and challenging puzzle. If I can play this game almost 2 weeks straight every single day and not be bored of it, you know it's a great game. I'm constantly thinking about it and I can't wait to play again. This may move up to my favorite game ever and that's quite the feat.

If you're thinking about getting the expansion, do it. It takes this already amazing game and kicks it up a notch.


After a couple more plays, I can honestly say this game is amazing. I was a bit worried after the first play or two, but each subsequent play has gotten better and better. Turns can be a bit slow with new players, but man is this a brilliant game. So much to do and so little time. Leveling up is fun and acquiring new guys to fight for you is great. Each spell you acquire and each character you play can vastly change the game up. Quite replayable for being essentially the same objective each time.

Initially, as a solo game, I was turned off. Trying to learn the game and play it solo was far too much for me. After knowing the rules well enough, playing solo has gone from being a chore, to being very fun. I still find it more fun with 2 or 3 players, but solo is a very viable option now.

Even though I rate this game a 10, I wouldn't play it any chance I got. I love the game, but it's not something I want to play at any request, especially if I had to teach more than 1 new player at a time.

This is a monolith of a game - large, imposing, inscrutable, and thoroughly impressive. There is game design for miles in this package. Truly a wealth of options and paths to be taken on any given game turn: many people will look at their hand, look at the board, and decide they can't do anything. They are wrong. 

Now, there is an ugly side to all this: the rules overhead is monstrous. It is sometimes quite difficult to find the rule or clarification you are looking for, and even when you think you have the rules down, there is likely some small piece you overlooked. That doesn't stop every game from being fun and epic, though.

One of the very few games I want to give a 10 to.  I just have never seen anything 10 worthy.  However; Mage Knight is close.  You have to get over the depth of the rules but for anyone with a wargame, role playing or similar background it's not as bad as it's made out to be.  Matter of fact I would call the options diverse rather than overwhelming.  Once you are familiar with the game it plays at a brisk pace but still with an incredible depth and just oozing theme.

LOVE IT!

Love the solo game option. Great fusion of euro and ameri-trash. This game will have you thinking about it when you aren't even playing. 

The co-op didn't go over so well. My wife found the games learning curve initially difficult, but ultimately she was frustrated by the feeling of not being able to do much. Though she understood it was because she just didn't know how to play very skillfully. The game does take time to get good at.

I would only play this game two player. Anything more would be torture.

The game is a bit of a table hog and it may take you awhile to figure out an optimal configuration.

This has become one of my favorite solo games and favorite games period! This one goes to eleven.

If only it were a bit shorter... but all in all it's a great game with many great mechanics in it. Basically everything is done with cards. Sometimes there are no random factors and you can calculate everything, which would be quite disastrous with a group prone to AP, but usually this is quite tolerable. Probably the best Runeboundish game there is. I wouldn't even try to play this with 4 players, even 3 seemed to be quite too many considering the length and downtime. The only downside of this game is that I'm not able to play it often due to enormous duration.

One of my favourites - Heroes of Might and Magic of boardgames (that says a lot)! Yet the game is a bit too time consuming and set up takes half an eternity. But the game is so good. Action defining deck-hand mechanic offers so many options each turn and character progression is done superbly.

RATING: 9.25
Fun Factor: 9 (Who doesn't like trying to build a hero and see how powerful you can become...)
Components: 9 (Nice insert, cards are silky but a bit flimsy- I sleeved, but comes with nice pre-painted minis and a faithful art direction that is immediately likable)
Theme: 8 (Good background info, good thematic elements a bit generic but this is kindof a good thing)
Mechanics: 10 (Several elements come together to make something magic.  At the heart is the deckbuilding as you adventure, which is quite well done and serves as the heart and soul of the game. Technically very tight in terms of design.  Rules fairly well written.)
Theme + Mechanics: 9
Replay Value: 9 (Very good replay value.  This game is adjustable in so many ways and it is quite EASY to make said adjustments)
Scaling/Players: 10

Subjective: +0.25 Very few games offer customizability of conflict level between players straight out of the box.  For this, the game receives a bump for innovation.

Ok.  Mage Knight.  What can I say.  This game is endearing on many levels.  It is Talisman for a new age, deckbuilding in an adventure game, and most amazingly, not only can you perfectly scale player count... 

you also have perfect scaling in terms of level of cooperation.  Now this is something fairly innovative! You can literally dial the cooperation in the game from solo to fully co-op to semi-co-op and anywhere from mildly competitive to severely competitive.  There is even what amounts to a "king of the hill" style scenario where the last man standing on the portal when the sun sets is the victor.  Now I must admit, this is something very useful.  I have groups that want conflict, and groups that don't.  This game suits them all with but a few minor adjustments.

People have said that Mage Knight is a bit fiddly.  I disagree.  I feel that this is the Goldilocks of the Adventure genre... JUST RIGHT in almost all respects.

I already thought Through the Ages felt too much like a video game and was too long to setup and play with the full player count. This one is even worst. I still love both games, but since my player group is 4 players most of the time, there is no way I'm ever going to play this again.

30 minutes to refresh yourself on the badly organized rules, 3 to 4 hours to try to build a deck and get points.  A neat board game concept of a deck-building board game of exploration and conquering, but the execution takes you on an overly long road trip to get to the climax.

RATING: 10
This game is epic. Every turn is a puzzle with a multitude of options. They way deckbuilding is used to represent a player's character leveling up and becoming stronger is just perfect. The only downside is the downtime. Hence, it is best with 1 or 2 players. I tend to only go higher if everyone is experienced.

RATING: 6
The wounds system is so confusing that it initially made me want to cry.  Never learn games when tired.  

Overall, the game is ok, but for the complexity and length it doesn't scratch my itch for either co-operation or fantasy theme.  

I like the deck-buiding aspect, especially the more I have played it.  However, I feel like I could play a deck-building game that's less cumbersome several times over in the time it takes to play this game.

How many ways is this game amazing? It's very heady, but it kind of needs to be. Once you crack that nut, you can unleash some extremely satisfying and memorable tricks.

This is a dry, soulless euro wrapped in a fantasy adventure theme - which is awesome. A really tight and hard game. Essentially it boils down to what can you do with what you have. I prefer to play coop style (one of the few games I like as a coop) and just do your best to defeat the game together. A little complicated and thus does not get played a lot.

This is one really great game. It takes a while to play (which probably improves when you know what all the different locations are and symbols mean), but it doens't become boring for a second, on the condition you play this with people who don't think everything trough, but just play along. However I'm afraid that because of the complexity it will also be the kind of game you'll play once a year (therefore I'll rate it only an 8 instead of a 9) and in fact that is really a pity for such a excellent game.

Modern sibling to Magic Realm, easier to learn and play with less charm and character than its predecessor, but still great fun for such a long game. Played solo and 3 players and both worked out well. I would recommend for the solo player or smaller gaming groups. I think a four player game is a no no due to the sheer length of the game and the inevitable downtime between turns.

For my money, this is the quintessential solo playing game.  To play even with one extra player extends this game into a marathon length of time.  That being said, it is incredibly difficult to win.  This doesn't stop me from playing it though.  the deckbuilding is fantastic, the leveling up and abilities lend to creating a truly unique character every time you play it.

Overrated. 

It's not bad. But: it provides a frustrating experience, and not in the good way. A long slog. 

At the end of the day, it's a solo game -- whether you're playing a solo, co-op, or competitive scenario. Multi-player solitaire at its core.

This game is great with a lot of interesting components but make sure you are in the mood for a super complicated pile of rules.

Each character you play is pretty unique and drastically changes the approach you take to success.

This game is amazing in so many ways!  Every time I play I discover new strategies and can innovate.  The complexity can be a little overwhelming at first, but it is well worth it to take your time and understand the rules.

Wonderful. Currently my favorite game (March 2015).It's not particularly complicated, nowhere near as heavy as people make it out to be, there are just a lot of rules. A whole lot. It took me an hour or two of reading, and another two hours of playing before I 'got it', but it's not that complicated, just rules intensive.

The game plays like the lovechild of a fantasy adventure game, a puzzle game, and a deckbuilder. It's a ton of fun solo or with two people. 

I can't recommend this game highly enough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Yes, yes, yes! This deserves a 10 and a spot in my personal top 10 on its merits as a solo game alone. I would never have thought a solo game could be so great. And it's not too shabby when played with friends either.

One thing I hadn't realized from all the reviews and comments I'd read, and something you won't get from playing the walkthrough scenario, is how much tension and pressure and thrill there is in solving the giant puzzle that is Mage Knight as well as you possibly can. Sure, you can do this and that, explore a dungeon here, fight some orcs there, do whatever you like, but everything you do has the ultimate goal of getting as strong as you can as quickly as you can, to be able to defeat the end bosses (the cities) before the game ends. So you have to constantly push yourself to engage enemies, squeeze everything you can from villages and the like, and take risks. The walkthrough is a bit ho-hum, "let's see what would I like to do now", but the full (solo) game is more "what do I need to do?? AAAAH I'm not going to make it!!!". Going in because you have to, risking success or failure on a single battle because there is no other choice, and then finding the exact sequence of cards to narrowly defeat the enemies, is awesome.

I dislike games that are basically linear puzzles, where all you do is calculate if option A or B will bring you more points, then take that action. But what I've found is that I LOVE games that feel like multi-layered puzzles, with the right amount of luck/randomness, a great theme and some fighting. Like Magic: the Gathering and Neuroshima Hex!, Mage Knight delivers, and is my favorite of this type of game.

Things you need to know.

1.) There is a lot of downtime in a multiplayer game. It gets less as players learn the game. This game is best enjoyed solo, or with 2 players.

2.) There is a learning curve. It will take you a few games, and a few rulebook readthroughs before you feel comfortable. 

3.) There is *some* luck involved. It seems like a lot at first, but the more you play the game the more the luck fades and all you see is infinite choices, making it a tactical treasure trove. 

4.) This game is not for everyone. Read some of the game reviews on the forums before you buy.

5.) If this seems like a game you will enjoy, and you have a bit of patience and perseverance, there is a good chance that it will be the best gaming experience you will ever have. Was for me and many others.

Amazing solo experience! My absolute favourite board game - but due to the playing time and amount of brain work needed for successful questing, I don't play it all that often. Ok with two or three players too but easily gets very time consuming.

Too lomg for what it is. If you've got kids and want a fun dungeon crawler I suppose it's ok. 

I don't like it for character development purposes. There are some evil looking cards and evil actions you can take in the game to hurt others and get ahead. You can pillage and intimidate, burn down monestaries for loot and to get ahead. You get a bad reputation but the penalty suffered may still make it worth your while. I don't like it for teaching morality so wouldn't add it to my collection for that reason.

With other players I like 2-3 players best, with 4 players the downtime is a little too long. But either way, hours pass by without even noticing it. Although there are many rules, they are logic. And once you understand how the walkthrough/rulebook works, you can find the rules easily.

There is a lot to like in this game.

Only played the introductory scenario so far.  The basic simple player turn of move and then do something is complicated by trying to best decide how to play your cards when they present problems of not matching what you want to do.  And the large number of icons varying combat abilities takes some getting used to.

So there is a significant learning curve, but it is worth the effort.

This is like an epic cross between a puzzle game, an RPG and Dominion.

Unlike most boardgames with a solo mode, this truly works as a solo game. It also works with more players, but can be on the slower end of the spectrum.

It encompasses a wide range of game styles; from co-op through to aggressively competitive games, including pvp - although, house rules are wanted for the more co-op end of the spectrum to prevent it being multi-player solo games.

It has impressively balanced asymmetric powers - different powers suit different play styles and scenarios better or worse, but there appears to be no online consensus about which is best.

This is a crazy game. But a good game. It is also tough but fair. My hardcore PC-gamer little brother who hates 99% of everything because it's "too casual" absolutely loves this one, to the point at which he basically only plays this and Netrunner. It's such a rules nightmare though, but if you care about the core gameplay it's manageable.

Tentative rating: 10/10 if you love in-depth RPGs. 0/10 if you hate having to consult the manual during gameplay.

Update: My brother has at least 25 plays of this and still loves it. I play it with him whenever I can. I have to respect a design that can keep him, the most depth-driven gamer I know, excited to play it after all this time. It's not right for everyone, but I's great at what it wants to be.

Játszottam már, de még kaotikusak a gondolataim, nem tiszta csomó minden, és így értékelhetetlen még! Látom, már a fényt az alagút végén, de hogy kijutok-e valaha....?

Egyébként szerintem euro játék, komoly tematikával felvértezve, csak itt nem nyersanyagokat gyűjtögetünk. 
No hát ez egy pakliépítős, erőforrás menedzselős játék fantasy köntösben. 4 fővel izgalmas játék nagyon, most még csak felfedezgettünk, de a következő vérre megy!:D

A bonyolult szabály miatt le kell vonnom, mert ha nem játszik vele az ember "újra" be kell nyalnom a szabályt, ami bizony nem kis munka.

Was debating for a long time whether or not to get this game b/c of all the reviews saying that its long and heavy.  Well i'm glad i got it, was worth every penny.  I found that the rules were easy to understand, and well laid out.  Once you know the rules game play is easy and teaching the game is a breeze.  The satisfaction of being able to complete a scenario was as gratifying in every aspect.

The solo component is solid.

Lots of details with no clear progress. At least in shorter scenarios, the deck-building aspect doesn't really get to shine enough, and the game does not seem to have sufficient depth to warrant the length.

Holy Vlaada ! What an Ameritrash beast, pre-painted miniatures, modular hex-board, scenario based, spells, artefacts, advanced skills. Great Ameritrash game with some Euro mechanics thrown in. It feels and plays great and I cannot wait to try it again, let's hope further plays prove to be even more exciting than the intro scenario. 

2nd Play: Slightly underwhelmed. The game felt more or less the same and I think there is not enough randomness and excitement in here for a proper Ameritrash game. The game is balanced and Euro-like that it never feels awesome or thrilling but drags along in a stale and calculating pace. Not bad at all, but I am less impressed than I was the first time I tried it.

Took a little bit but I finally wound up falling in love with this one. A massive experience, with, levers, buttons and moving parts everywhere.

With so much to explore, conquer and reckon with, no two games have felt alike. 

The feeling Mage Knight rewards you with, when pulling off something big and ambitious, is not just what I was hoping for from this game, but what I hunger for through gaming in general.

Solitaire it has been great and I can already see that it is going to end up relegating some of my other solo fave's to the dreaded, "shelf". 

Two player the other night was also a blast and didn't take nearly as long as some would have you believe.

Yes, the rule books are a bit of a chore and you will be bouncing between the two of them once the game is on the table. But the community here at BGG is amazing and beyond helpful..better than any index.

Part deck building card game and part adventure / RPG, my two favorite genres! There's a lot to learn at first, and the first game takes some time, but the manuals / tutorial scenario / reference cards explain everything well. Future games are much faster to set up and play much quicker. One downside is the cards want to stick together. Not to the point that sleeves are required, but they're nice.

Very good solitaire game.  I have played probably 50+ solitaire games and have really enjoyed myself.  That being said, this game is not a good multiplayer game.  Which is why I only give it a 8.  Multiplayer has a ton of down time, and very little player interaction, both of which I find very important in multiplayer games.

RATING: 8
This is an absolutely phenomenal solo game. There is enough here to keep a solo player thoroughly occupied without the need for a human opponent. Be warned however, this is very long (and I imagine even more so with human opponents) very, very heavy game. It successfully combines aspects of fantasy adventure and deck building and feels so well crafted and tight that you won't believe it came out of one man's head. That said, this is not for everyone. If theme and story are why you like fantasy adventure games you may not like Mage Knight, there is basically no story and the theme, while present, is not nearly as thick or important as it is in say Runebound; this is all about the beautiful mechanics.

My first attempt at buying this game came with 32 missing cards. Despite trying to directly talk with support, they refused to give me 22 more cards.

Instead, I requested a replacement with my supplier, and the second copy had everything. Thanks, Amazon.

If you think you will like it and you have what it takes to play it many times you will love Mage Knight.

Loving this game!
Bought it for solo play, but I hope to play it multiplayer some day.

The possibilities in this game are huge! You can go for different strategies: should I get some spells, units or advanced actions? Should I try to get some artifacts?

Luck is a part of the game, and I've had a few plays where the cards I drew never seemed to work with what I wanted. Which is why it doesn't quite score a 10.

Overall this game is one of my favorites. Each game lasts around 2 hours, but each game just fly right by.



Some 15 plays later, the game has lost some of its initial shine. Considering selling

After 18 plays, the game is running a bit stale for me. I am happy to have owned and played it a lot, but feel like it is time to pass it on.

Rated after one play. Lots of rules, our first game was ponderously slow. But it will clearly go much more quickly when we're more familiar with it. This game offers plenty of options throughout: play felt very open and unscripted. Plenty of randomness in shuffled decks should mean lots of replayability, even without the many different scenarios. Theme is rich, if a bit generic. The production quality is high.

First, I wish I would play it more often.  If you spend too much time in between plays you're doomed to constantly be referencing the rules as you play, which turns what should be a 90 minute game into 3 hours.  Ugh!

Sadly, this game just takes too long!  I like everything about this game, but it's so involved that I rarely get it out because there are just so many other satisfying games that take 1/3 the time.

Because of how long this game plays I don't think I can ever rate it higher than I have already.

There is just so much going on in this game.  The rules aren't hard per se...just so much to keep track of.

RATING: 7
Despite the laborious way doing anything first requires you to choose the right combination of cards from your deck, the end result is a very rewarding grind through hostile territory. There are plenty of meaty decisions to be made.

Everything is tightly tied into your deck, despite the map, and you can evolve your character in interesting ways. 

In an odd way, the challenging use of a deck to try to navigate safely around a map reminds me of the simple (but great) race game Snow Tails (the 1st edition).

RATING: 7
This game is about 5 min puzzles between the players. Each time the player must count from usually all available information if he is going to get something done during his turn. The result is very long and boring game for something that should be about adventure.

Would work very well as a solo game, if you are interested in those. In that case I could rate this 9 or even 10. I however don't think solo play is what gets me to the boardgames.

This is quite possibly the best board game that I own. It took me a long time to learn it and also to utilize all of my options when playing, with the little details and exceptions being the most frustrating to fully understand. But when I finally got past the learning curve, I started to love the game even more. The game has a very unique and complex combat system. Add resource (mana) management, recruiting and deck building to that, and each battle becomes a brainstorm. I had a lot of fun playing this game solo.

Edit: We tried it 4-players last night for the first time. Although it was fun, play-time was too long. After a while people just wished the game would end. We had to stop before we even got to the real action. That was right after we took the first city, and there were still 3 more cities to conquer. So I guess I would not suggest playing this game with more than 2, if you want it to end sooner. But note that we were already tired when we started to play and the game had to be introduced to new players.

3/3/14: After a 3-player co-operative game that lasted about 8 hours (because we had extended the game by 2 rounds) in which we conquered 4 cities, all of us felt really exhausted. It was fun from the beginning to the mid-game. Then it became painful, but stil fun. I think I wouldn't play this scenario again, but I'd play a shorter one.

This is the game I've always wanted:

Heavily tactical
Rewards various different strategies
Enjoyable in solo, competitive, AND cooperative modes
Each game is drastically different 
Several ways to play (Scenarios)
Easy to expand (House rules, New scenarios, Expansion)

I play this over and over with my friends, family, and self just to try and beat our high scores, and sometimes each other. The only downfall this game had was less interaction in cooperative play, but the expansion fixes that and does much more!

This game is  kind of a mix of Rune Age and Runebound with a lot more rules and depth.  One solo play and I haven't made a decision on what I think of this game yet.  More plays are needed.  It's that type of game. Update: my second play I'm really start to like what's going on here.  Once you start to get the rules the game theme becomes much more immersive.  This game is long!!  My rating is early and conservative but this has huge potential to rise and is already flirting with my favorite game of this type in an epic form- World of Warcraft.  If I'm looking for a quicker game with the same feel albeit lightened I'd choose Runebound.

July 2012: Borrowed Tim's copy for a couple days, decided not to buy and then a week later I HAD to get my own copy. Found myself watching game videos and reading a bunch about the game, so I had to bite the bullet and buy it. Been playing some solo and some with my 10 year-old son at the beach. There's sooooo much to keep track of in this one rule-wise, but the game is so much fun to play that it makes the research worth it. And each play, I find myself confused less and less often. Like lots of other guys say, it's nice to have a table where you can just leave it set up. Craziest thing is how very, very fast time flies when you play. Pop your had up and it's been another hour. 

Oct. 2012 update: I haven't played this since the summer.  I guess because it takes a while and keeps a table filled up for a couple of days.  Need to bring it out again to see if it was just a cool summertime game.

RATING: 7
It is very easy to see the appeal of this game, real thought has been put into the components which are just delightful. They create an effect a lot like a turn based computer strategy game. The rule books are good, but not as good as the components (noticeable typos, and a separate scenario book would have really helped).
In the solitaire mode (it also plays co-operatively and competitively) you guide your warrior mage as they explore a map fighting monsters, recruiting armies, and looting spells. Accumulate fame as these are the basis of victory points - but do it quickly, you get points for time as well. 
Rule complexity will vary for players. I found them medium weight, but I come from a hex-wargaming/role-playing background. If you are approaching from a light-medium Euro background you will probably find them a little intimidating. Most of them are fairly intuitive, and with some minor exceptions it is relatively easy to find the relevant section to check.

20.03.2013 - Took the gamble and bought this, as most comments have been about how awful it is to try and teach others.

31.03.2013 - Previous RPG board games have been very hit and miss.  Liked Decent 2.  Didn't enjoy Drizit.  Should these 3 games be compared, well, why not.  If your unsure about all 3 and new to the genre (ie Me), then these would be on your radar.  First impression, Mage Knight certainly has a lot more detail but is less fun than Decent. Initial rating 7.5, expecting this to change.

I had very big expectations of this game when I first heard about it in early 2012 - I loved the sound of the mechanics, it's by one of my favourite designers, and I watched it shoot up the BGG rankings into the top 10. I managed to buy a copy in May 2012, but it has seen very little play - one 4-player game with my regular group, a couple of solo plays by me, all using just the introductory scenario, and a 2p co-op game with my wife. While no-one seemed to hate the game in that 4-player experience, no-one asked for another game, and I'm loath to suggest it as the game takes so long (and everyone would have forgotten all the rules by now, anyway). And, while I've enjoyed each game, I can't ever quite get away from the feeling that there are too many rules (particularly for all the different types of site), which get in the way of the experience a bit. Of course, it's great seeing your character get more and more powerful over the course of the game. 

So while I want to love this game, in practice I can't quite bring myself to - and I will almost never get to play. It's definitely a great game, but I do fear that it perhaps attempts to do too much. That doesn't stop me wanting to play it.

RATING: N/A
+ Extremely deep game, some herald it as a modern Magic Realm. With some brief exposure to Magic Realm, I can say this is far more streamlined but will probably scratch the same itch
+ A big challenge even for players who love heavy thinking/analytical games
+ Ruleset is actually quite simple after a few plays
+ Chaotic neutral game, players can work together or against each other as they please (a pleasant change from pure cooperative games)

+/- Someone described it as "immersive, you'll spend a lot of your time immersing yourself in the rulebook". This is true, you will be referencing both rulebooks constantly even after having played a few times and I could see it being tedious for some. This game isn't for everyone but is very rewarding and engaging if you can get into it

- I can't imagine playing this game with anyone who hasn't played it before, the learning curve is very steep and introducing someone to the game would take multiple plays for them to get to the point where they can grasp the rules and appreciate the game, it requires a lot of patience
- Long, even for a solo game, this game can take 3 hours or more quite easily (not a major downside, but don't expect to succeed in under 90 minutes the first few times)

Rating could go up but probably sits pretty stable here. It uses deckbuilding in a way that feels different from the deckbuilding games. The card system works really well - especially in combat, as you know what kind of strength you'll have going in and you can really tailor the additions to what you want your character's strength to be. The day/night system actually works and provides a different feel between the two times of day. It's solid stuff.

Seems like a very good game but was way deeper and involved than I feel like having right now. I have two young boys and would have to leave this up for days, without it getting bumped accidentally, to be able to finish it. I think that Runebound is more likely to suit my needs right now, on the plus side my 8 yr old can play that one with me.

Excellent game but it is a real brain burner. Also takes ages to play so I would never play with more than 2 or 3.

Most of the 3 day/3 night missions tend to drag by the last day/night so I prefer shorter ones.

Really feels like an RPG though.

Was das kollektive Überschätzen anbetrifft, rangiert das von seinen Komponenten her geradezu zauberhafte „Mage Knight“ im Jahr 2011/2012 gleich hinter „Eclipse“, wenn auch aus etwas anderen Gründen: Mir dauert das Spiel zu lang; mit drei Personen ufert die Downtime regelmäßig aus – und wirklich über seinen eigenen Zug nachdenken kann man nur sehr oberflächlich. Mir ist das Spiel zu kompliziert, wo es nicht kompliziert sein muß: Die (auch noch am Tag und Nacht) unterschiedlichen Mana-Sorten bringen kaum spielerischen Gewinn, ganz zu schweigen von den bedenklich dummen Bewegungsregeln bzw. -einschränkungen. Mir ist das Spiel zu zufällig: Entweder ich räume einen Wizard-Tower quasi im Vorbeigehen oder aber ich brauche 10 Turns Aufrüstung, um ein Dungeon bewältigen zu können, was mir dann einen Zug zuvor ein Mitspieler wegschnappt, weil er zufällig die richtige Kartenkombination auf die Hand zieht. Was das Spiel ‚rettet‘, ist sein recht ordentlicher Solo-Modus. Auch hier bin ich auf Reviews der Erweiterung gespannt.

For me, this is a good game that is let down a little by the lack of interaction between the players.

While you are all working towards a common goal - you are all working individually towards it. Early in the game, it is important to walk off in different directions. If you follow someone and don't get good movement cards - you run the risk of them getting all the level ups before you do. Once you get to the later parts of the board, lack of leveling will hurt you!

So while it is a 1-5 player game, I feel it plays much better as a 1-2 player game. Which is sad.

Good levelling mechanics though, and solid gameplay mechanics.

Probably my favorite game.  I love playing games solitare and this one is so immersive, thematic, strategic all at the same time.  Yes, the rulebook is not the greatest and it took me about 10 hours to learn it well.  It's like it's own language, but once you learn it, it is so smooth and fun!  Worth it!  If I only had enough free time, I'd play this 24/7.

Oh... and that Lost Legion expansion... awesome!!

Only worth playing solo but it's about the only >1 hour game I've played that really DESERVES to be that long AND rewards replaying. Very few board games capture either the former or the latter.

Only thing keeping it from the upper echelons is that it's too damn long to screw up and you only realize you're boned from poor early management of your luck way when the game is almost over.

This game can also be played solo.

My first 4-player test game took us 4 hours for the intro scenario. We didn't finish this scenario but had 4 tiles remaining when we stopped. We played 4 hours.

The game takes long, especially with 4 players. The rules are complex. There is a lot to learn during the first game. But I think the rules are not difficult to remember as soon as you have understood them. There are also reference cards. The game components are of high quality.

Solo play is fun. The games I've played took several hours, but I didn't notice because this game is so involving. I also recommend solo play for learning the rule. During my frst two solo plays I kept reading the rules over and over. They are complex and difficult but the rulebook explains them well. I only had to check the geek for the character skills sometimes.

Finally caved after eyeing this game for 5 years and picked up a copy. I was leery of the comments around the brain melting complexity but I found this game to be a blast. While each hand of cards presents a puzzle to be solved to achieve your goals, coming up with an optimal way to use your hand is very rewarding. I found the puzzles quicker to solve than those of Dungeon Lords. I'm looking forward to many more plays of this game. Tons of variety and replayability.

Tried to wrap my head around the rules twice and gave up both times. (I actually dubbed the rule books the Old and New Testament because of how massive they are and how small the writing is.) A year or so passed. I figured I'd trade or sell it - but my girlfriend wouldn't let me for some reason (it's not like she'll ever play it). And thank the heavens I didn't!

I heard about Ricky Royals playtrough tutorials and watched a couple of them. And the game's not really that complex - there are just a whole lot of rules to learn. Once you know them they kinda make sense. Big city assaults still require some seriously mathy puzzling, though. I'm not going to lie.

(I realize I'm probably missing a couple rules, but these are early days still.)

I absolutely love this game. How the hell can playing solo be this much fun? I was initially worried that Mage Knight had ruined other board games for me. Thankfully it didn't, but it's still better than almost all the others.

Love this.

Simply the richest and most rewarding gaming experience that I’ve come across (with the exception of D&D).  I play this solo whenever I can free up the time.  This is not a “perfect” game and is not for everyone but it rewards repeated play and delivers some of the most satisfying gameplay you’ll find.

My favorite solo game. I'd rather play rounds of this then play a solo PC RPG. It's so good and so full of lovely components and mechanics. It helps that it's truly a hodgepodge of mechanics (deckbuilding, resource management, adventure, leveling up, etc. etc.) that all comes together really nicely. It's quite long though. I wish it wasn't quite so beefy with more than 1 player.

This game overflows with theme. It's rich and wonderful. The art is fantastic as well.

Wow rules, rules, and more rules. Rules, rules, rules, and rules. Then check the rules, check, check, and check again. Then what a beautiful, hard, challenging, fun game. If I did that right let me check the rules. update 8-17: tried again this game is a fiddley beast that the more I played the more I dreaded my purchase. It's an absolute pain to teach takes forever to play and you feel the drag with no crushindo and/or excitement. But I  enjoyed solo just not multi-player. To much explaining not enough playing. I think there are better games out there.

Dropped my rating a bit due to game length and downtime. It's a fun game but it's so long and the downtime does suck a bit near the end of the game. Even when it's me holding the game up attacking a city I feel bad about making everyone wait 10 minutes on me. The game is epic near the end of the game though... taking out a city is pretty amazing when things all fall into place.

Amazing board game! Very good for playing alone or with 2 players. Its production design is just gorgeous. Perhaps the size of typography in the manual should be larger (there´s a lot of text and it´s very small...), although everything is perfectly organized and explained: step by step you learn how to play without effort. At first, you´ve the feeling of playing a puzzle-game, but once you play it more, you understand that everything makes sense, and it´s magnificent. It´s just a fantastic board game.

I love this game. It is the perfect solo game. For me at least. A tough, thinky game in which the goal is to beat the game rather than beat your highest score. (I hate those.) The nice thing is, it’s hard but beatable if you can just figure out how to play each turn as optimally as possible to achieve your objective. And the nice thing is, every game is different due to the random map tiles and monsters. And all the different characters you can play are different and have a different combat focus. And who doesn’t love leveling up and becoming more powerful as the game progresses.

The one knock I have against this fantastic game is the long setup time. So many different decks of cards, types of map tiles, and stacks of monster tokens to shuffle. If it wasn’t such a massive pain to set up, I would have 10 times as many plays as I currently do. I want to play it all the time, I just can’t be bothered to do all that shuffling.

29-12-2013. Well.. that turned out differently. I think I have played MK 5 times or so. And I love it. It's a GREAT game. But it takes ages.. Therefore Runebound to me seems like the better game, while in everything else except playtime MK is superior.

27-10-2013. EPIC! I think this in combination with expansion may replace Runebound completely for me. Gameplay is a lot stronger, the deckbuild element the best way I've seen to date to implement gradually growing stronger.

[b]Learning Curve[/b]
Woah!  Took me 3-4 days of reading through the Game Play-through guide just to play the tutorial run-through.  Once I understood what was going on, the game play was fun.  There's just a lot to process.  I really like that they have a walk-through guide in addition to the rulebook.  It really helps and makes it a lot less daunting.  Plus, you can follow along with it as you learn.

[b]Components[/b]
The components are good and the insert is really nice.  Everything fits perfectly.  No idea how I will fit the expansions in though.  Will likely need a new insert. Also, if you sleeve your cards, they will not all fit in the insert, however there is space to put them under one of the insert trays which is where I keep my character decks. The only components I thought could be better were the crystals.  Their shape is cool but the plastic used to create them is crappy.  Compared to all the acrylic types of gems out there, these look super blah.  They are not shiny or transparent.

Wizkids seems to have frequent issues with their production runs.  I had to do a replacement for a piece I was missing in the base game, and also some parts that were incorrectly made in one of the expansions.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Once I got the rules down everything seemed to flow well.  Lots to think about and strategize.  I like how turn sequence is structured so that as one player finishes their stuff the next player starts.  Cuts down on AP issues.  

There are A LOT of rules and symbols to keep track of.  This can be intimidating for some.  Fortunately, there are player aids here on BGG and a reference sheet for download on the Wizkids website.

Disappointed again by Vlaada! In theory, this game sounds great, but it is just a lot of fiddliness, with a very poor implementation of the deck-building mechanic.

Man this is good. I have to move this up to a 10. I can't imagine playing with 4 players unless everyone was super comfortable with the game, but solo or with 2 this is just fantastic.

Wow, this game is really interesting. I am not sure where my final rating will end up, it could be as high as a 10 or as low as a 6. Like other Vlaada games I really think they design is super smart and interesting, but the long downtime may be a killer. As a solo game this is fantastic. I need to try a couple of 2 player games and see how those go before trying to add in a full compliment of players.

I've only tried out the intro scenario, but this is a FUN game!!! It adds complexity that I wished Runebound and Descent had. However, in some areas the complexity is a bit more than it should be. I'm still trying to learn all of the rules to make sure that I am playing it right. I give it a 9 until I have played it more at which point I'll probably bump it up to a 10.

UPDATE: Would be a 10, but it is simply too long to be perfect (That means I can not play it as often I would like to). You rarely have the all well-informed crowd at the table that you'd never have to look up some rules in case of doubt, which stretches the playing time even more. Apart from that, I simply love it. Probably Vlaadas masterpiece and the best adventure game I can imagine. For my son and myself, it's gaming heaven.

One play, on the introductory scenario.  I enjoyed some aspects of it and can see why it's so popular, but overall it was too long for me, and too "Dungeon Lordsy" - by that I mean that it turns into a combat puzzle, and then there are lots of end-game VPs for all sorts of things (it might have helped if we'd known this before the game ended!!!).

'In this scenario, we are going to play for two days and two nights.' Trust me, it is not only the in-game time frame but also probably the real playing time.

But that is a matter of taste and I can see that this game system has great potential!

My experience of this game is mixed. With several players, I have found it, so far, to be slow, painful multiplayer solitaire. On the other hand, it is probably the best game for solo play that I have ever encountered. At the same time the components are a massive let down. 

[b]Multiplayer[/b]: The first game certainly dragged; including rules explanations, we (four players) managed to complete four turns (i.e. two days, two nights) in almost six hours. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to skip the walkthrough scenario into the main game. . . Learning this game is a complete pain, and in general Mage Knight should be avoided with four players, at least at the beginning. The second game took about five hours including set up, but with three players we did get through three days (i.e. six turns); none the less, we still spent a lot of time thinking about our cards, looking at the board, looking back at our cards etc. The third game was with four, and that took about seven hours. There is much militating against it as a multiplayer game: There seems to be little means of catching up with a player in the lead. Bad mistakes can cost dearly, and it is difficult to come back from them.

[b]Solitaire[/b]: Here, the game really shines. It's fun to watch your mage knight increase in power, to explore the different capabilities of the characters and learn about the interactions of the cards. With several players, I felt as if I was playing on my own anyway, so it's great to be able to cut out all that waiting around. For me, it's perhaps the perfect solitaire game: the challenge is not created by random card draws throwing up problems which you have to deal with; rather, you have a situation (not fully known to you) that you have to puzzle out to find the best way of using your resources to exploit it. 

[b]Components[/b]: I have the second printing,which has absolutely awful components: cards curled like pringles, territory tiles with damaged backs, counters printed on the wrong sides. It would require getting almost the entire game again to replace the sup-par components. How this, especially the misshapen cards, will work with the expansion is anyone's guess.

[b]Summmary:[/b] Basically, it's worth getting the game for solitaire play alone. I don't think I'd want to teach anybody the game, but I'd be happy to play it with experienced players. If you are worried about components, wait until they actually manage to publish a decent edition.

Despite the large amount of rules and down time this game has a few fundamental issues down to its core. After a hand full of plays I have learned a few things:

1. Movement is difficult. In a larger game especially if the other players explore in a different direction and find something worth exploring too bad for you, you'll never make it in time (if at all). 

2. The player who takes the lead doesn't lose the lead. If someone gain a couple fast levels they are able to defeat the stronger monsters everyone else leaves behind because they are unable to fight them yet, thus pulling further ahead. 

3. Depending on the scenario scoring is superfluous. Unless the game is very close the players who already have fame remain in the lead. Scoring is based on what you have done in the game and the person who has the most fame has done the most resulting in them getting more fame and just winning by a larger margin. 

Maybe I haven't played it enough yet to "get it" but for now I think I need a break.

Mage Knight is a challenging game in every sense of the word. Difficult to learn, difficult to master, and difficult to explain. But the effort has so far proven to be worth it. This is an engaging game that pushes the idea of what's possible in a fantasy board game setting. It's sometimes just a little too much work for its own good, but I admire its ambition and its strategic depth. Definitely try before you buy though.

RATING: 9
This is one of my favourite games, and for me one of the few that is both interesting and entertaining enough to enjoy solo.  An RPG game for lack of a better category, yet not featuring/requiring much roleplaying.  This is a game in which you begin feeling rather weak, struggling to puzzle out how to move two spaces and vanquish a small pack of goblins with the cards you've drawn, and end the game (hopefully) staring deep into your large hand of cards, searching for the way to optimally defeat multiple formidable enemies and seize control of entire cities.  There is a real sense of progression there, but from the first turn to the last, you will be working on a puzzle.  For some people, this isn't what they enjoy, or expect from a game labeled an RPG, but for me and many others, it's an incredibly fun and rewarding experience.

The potential pitfalls here have to be acknowledged.  The game is usually incredibly long, particularly with players who like to evaluate several or all possibilities before making a move.  There can also be a "runaway leader" issue; if you have a few very successful turns in a row, and an opponent has one or two dud turns around the same time, the difference in your resulting positions can be massive.  Furthermore, the more successful you are, the easier it gets to continue to succeed, so usually nothing is stopping you from accelerating further and further into the lead.  Some people are fine with this and don't consider it a problem; this is a pretty low-luck game, too, so you might say the better player is winning and be satisfied.  Many people might not enjoy it though, and while those people often would opt to concede and ask to start another game, Mage Knight just isn't the sort of game that the winner will want to cut short, because the payoffs keep getting more satisfying as long as you are doing well.  Variants, which I haven't tried, apparently do address this issue.

Finally, though the "deckbuilding" aspect of this game is perfect for what it is, Mage Knight doesn't scratch the deckbuilding itch for me at all, and I don't think it will for most people; you play through your deck once each round, and you don't add or remove cards all that often.

Two solo games so far and I LOVE IT!

I don't usually like solo gaming but this feel like playing a good computer game.

I need to convince someone to play this with me when I have a good grasp of the rules.

I think this is not a game that is that complicated if you have an experienced player guiding you and managing the game.

Rating should go up.

Edit - Afraid to set up a solo game as I am not sure I will finish a game in one sitting, almost certain I will not.

Incredibly challenging fantasy adventure game that I got primarily to play solo. A couple games under my belt and I'm not exactly sure what to think yet. Both games seemed to take an incredibly long time, yet I didn't feel like I really did anything. The good thing is that all I can think about is playing it again, and what I should do my next time out. I'm definitely still learning.

Excelent game - probably my joint favourite fantasy adventure game with Descent. They both have the same balence of theme and tactics. 

A real sense of a growing, powerful 'hero' (protagonist, at any rate). Slightly worried that the lack of choice with many elements (often choose 1 out of 2 or 3), including the deckbuilding aspects, make it a bit more random than I'd like at times, but there's definately enough tactical depth there in spite of this small complaint.

Once this gets a few more expansions, I'm sure it'll become my number one!

Mage Knight! I've played, but only solo--to be honest, I don't know who among my friends I could put through this that wouldn't swear off gaming with me for a month afterward as a result...but as a solo experience, it's fantastic, it feels like you can spend an endless amount of time in the world, perfecting all of the moves, exploring, exploring.

I can't really explain it, but owning some games feels like you've bought a little world-time-pocket that you can escape to for an eternity without actually being there for very long. I can feel the pocket-world even just looking at the game. It's comforting.

eh, downgraded after initial reactions--it's just too much work to get out and play, I always find myself going for something less rules dense--I love the complexity, but not the rules density.

It is a very interesting game mixing deck building and a adventure game.  Lots of difficult calculation do figure out what you can do.  I was having a hard time getting all the rules down in my first play.  A second play may really smooth it out.

How this game is close to the top 20 is beyond me. Wonder if that will change once more people play it with the reprint

This is a very slow game. Movement is the most difficult part of the game, imo.

With four players, expect at least 5 hours.

I'm just not sure it's really going to hold up.

----
Sorry Vladaa. Posters on this forum were rude enough to make me never want to play the game again.

I think there is just not enough deck control early in the game and going last can totally wreck your game.

Add to that the slow nature of movement. What does this really add to the game other than longer playtime? So, I move four two hexes, redraw my hand, and wait 30 minutes for my next turn.

Does this add anything meaningful to the game? What does it intend to abstract? Thematically the game takes place over 3 days and 3 nights. Are these biblical days and nights?

I think you could half movement costs and lose nothing but playtime and downtime. 

This is tough in a game that can easily last six hours.

Mixed feelings here. The game is beautiful, long, thematic, has lots of interesting mechanisms and requires as much thinking as at least a medium euro so it should therefore appeal to me. Sadly, it's a bit too random, bad hands can lead to turns where you can't do anything much, and being crippled early forfeits your chances for accomplishing much later on. Probably best with two, any more an you have to be experienced and disciplined in order to fight downtime. There are lot of small rules to remember, requiring you to go through the rules before each play unless you play regularly and it's too niche for me to do so. If you don't have a constant partner I strongly advise you to try before buying. Still, I'll gladly sit down to it again, given time and an occasion.

RATING: 10
I enjoyed my one play of this, which was a 2player game, the other player helping me along with learning the rules as I went. The biggest turn off for me is that you only cycle through your deck a couple of times. It feels as though this would be a game that you'd get most out of solo, whilst yearning to have the multi-player experience with an equally matched opponent. Implements some ideas from Magic Realm well, and compared to that at least the rules are comprehendable, but I don't think this replaces its predecessor (nor indeed was it intended to, I'm sure).
2014 Edit: Now, I own the game, have got more plays in and am liking MK more and more. It is one of those games that really sticks in your mind after play (or during if you leave a solo game set up) - thinking about different ways it could play out. A surprisingly wide scope of ways to play, both from the subtle variation of scenarios and the very different approaches that can be taken during the game. The degree of determinism in the design  fascinates me for some reason. I've particularly enjoyed multi-player, which can get long, although certainly afternoon-able when playing Blitz. I'm much less concerned about the limited cycling, which only becomes another strategic factor to consider when making card purchases - but essentially with MK, the 'deck-building' label doesn't really fit: for me, a deck-builder needs to have deck-thinning and cycling as more significant considerations in play.

A game that I admired more than enjoyed.

In multi-player, there is too much down time between players and the game drags on too long (our first game took seven hours with just two players). I can't comment on solo - it might be much better time-wise - but since I don't play solo (typically) this is a moot point for me.

Also, I was surprised by just how much the game was un-thematic (relatively speaking).  I think this is due to the fact that the scenarios were rather bland in their ordinariness (i.e. conquer three cities) so there wasn't much of a narrative arc (i.e. what is my character even attempting to achieve?). Also, the art/graphics were plain (i.e. enemies were just tokens with poor design layout) and that you are limited to a single miniature (in a solo game) where additionally miniatures would have drawn you in more (even if there still little in way of a narrative).

Lastly, the rules was needlessly finicky and the rulebook was poorly laid out (some rules were in the walkthrough, some in the main rulebook, and some on the cards - and each had information the other didn't!)

Aside from my complaints, I do admit the deck building aspect was fascinating, each card had multiple uses so I always had options, the night and day mechanic added an extra flavor, and the walkthrough was a great way to learn the game.

However, the game is simply too long, too finicky, and not thematic enough to warrant the effort of the play time and the complicated rules.

This is an RPG in a box.  Love the experience system.  My favorite part though was learning how to play the game well.  When/how to use certain cards, when to fight monsters or attack towers to gain spells/how to use hired allies.  Only thing that keeps me from playing it all the time is the setup time and length of game.

Really heavy, slow moving game. Takes a long time to set up and play, yet doesn't feel adventurous or like it's telling a story. Long downtown where other players' actions don't concern me at all other than the fact that they mess up the board-state enough to discourage planning. Tedious. Theme is weak. Rules are a hodgepodge of other games' mechanics arbitrarily crammed together. I would rather play the myriad of other strongly themed fantasy games that are more focused on excelling at certain game styles or mechanics than this mess.

RATING: 7
Played the introductory scenario.  Lots of bits, lots of rules, but overall enjoyable. It did seem to be almost too much in the variety in what it took to battle and defeat the various creatures.  Not just the strengths, but all of the infinite variety of add-ons...fortifications, poison, summoning, swift.  Plus, as each tile was turned over the rules for the different locations were explained.

You can plan for your turn, but you need to have a backup (or two) as there is no guarantee the needed mana color will be available on a particular die.  

In the end, it was fun but feel my rating will adjust after another play or two - especially trying a full game rather than just the introduction.

Played the full version tonight.  The game is definitely much longer - but I felt more fulfilling.  But the need to plan ahead - and have a backup - is even more important.  Not a game to play with anyone with AP!  Because you can combine the dice/mana with the card actions it isn't quite a random or luck driven as might otherwise be the case.

An incredibly fun game with a lot of moving parts.  Components are a bit erratic in quality (i.e. colour quality) especially mixed with expansion.  Cards are great however.  You'll need a lot of table space to play.  The criticism that MK is a bit luck dependent is valid BUT I argue that lowering the difficulty a bit fixes that.

The best part of MK is the sheer flexibility of the game systems to adapt to whatever difficulty level you want, number of players, time to play etc..  Want a casual competitive scenario for couple of hours?  Or a epically long, cooperative one, without a dummy player pressure clock?  No problem, you can do it.

The inclusion of a detailed walkthrough, learning scenario is excellent.  It really smooths out the learning curve.

Finally, I think the expansion is almost required to complete the experience.

Fun, period.

Mage Knight is a great adventure game. There is some randomness in which tiles flip up, which cards you draw, and which enemies are placed. A large element of this game is figuring out how to get things done with the available resources. Each turn is a puzzle to solve, but there are often many possible solutions, so optimizing turns can be challenging. There is an enormous amount of strategy.

This game takes up a lot of table space, and is fairly fiddly. There are many rules, and it is easy to forget the details. 

On the other hand, this is one of the best solo games I've played.

When I first started playing I was hoping for a fun exploration and monster hunting game. What I got was a long cumbersome mechanism to do something as simple as moving. I found it boring and if you play this enough you can calculate every outcome of every move with out any risk. the game is very static.
The quality is not what I would expect. The cards absolutely need to be sleeved. they are very thin and since everything is done with them they will wear out quickly.

If you are into Euro gaming and are tired of processing German Mail or trading for sheep, this game may be for you.

Mage Knight is generally lauded as the return of the gamer's game that takes no prisoners. I'm all for HARDCORE games, but this one felt like complexity for complexity's sake, like Chvatil just threw everything in there without any editorial restraint from the publisher. Also lacks any cool/awesome/original ideas to justify the complexity, like Dungeon Lords, Trucker, Space Alert and Through the Ages all had. Just layer upon layer of complicated, disparate text abilities and rules to keep track of, plus seemingly endless combinations of options for your turn. It makes the game unplayable with more players, another sad trait shared by Through the Ages (best with 2, unplayable with 4, solely because of a lack of oversight in streamlining the decision process).

3 kinds of cards you can put into your deck, all with slightly different ways to use them, and all with complicated text. Units you can drag around to fight with, that you have to recruit at different types of places. 4 types of buildings and 4 types of adventure sites to keep track of. You get skill tokens as you go along, which are interpreted by reading a player aid with small text, and you may pick up your opponent's eventually, and read [i]their[/i] tiny player aid. Combat is reduced to an accountant's wet dream: interpret a few icons which permute all the halving of all the stats possible, and play  cards to match a bunch of numbers, while ensuring the keywords are a match. I want to walk around and smell the roses, not think to myself, "Put my left food forward, put my right foot forward, now raise hand. Can I reach there this turn? Calculating...". Not even the turn order is safe from all this piling on: instead of a simple and sweet fixed turn order or simple variable turn order procedure, players have to draft complicated abilities alongside their turn order for no reason other than "PHWOAR, MORE COMPLEXITY". Pages upon pages of optional rules.

The game is so weighed down, that it actually works well for solo play, where you have unlimited time to tackle an ocean of complexity. But it is also backhanded praise, especially since the advent of video games, to say that a board game plays best with one.

I'm usually one-and-done with Chvatil games, which usually have one or two cool ideas completely buried under a pile of unnecessary cosmetic rules (while this one doesn't even have that spark). [-]But this one I'll give a couple more chances since I do like the theme, I own the damn thing, and I already sleeved the damn thing: 200+ cards with thin/bent cardstock.[/-]

Wonder if people like this so much because to appear overwhelmed by complexity is to sound weak. There is nothing wrong in calling out Chvatil's lack of restraint in any of his designs. We should laud decision complexity, not "how many rules can I fit in this game and see BGG users drool over it and yell 'HARDCORE!'?"

This Ameritrasher says MK is a total wannabe, a Euro-in-AT clothing that panders to the Eurosnobs who think they're enjoying some authentic experience whilst sipping on their glasses of wine, whereas Chaos in the Old World is the true steel, the best Euro-AT hybrid ever made.

Still not sure how I feel about this purchase. It was touted as a deck-builder by the sources I used to make my decision to buy it, but this is far from a deck-builder.

Thus far this is a regrettable purchase.

Great adventure, a little complicated but offers a good sense of accomplishment at the end. The two rule books are terrible, microscopic letters, no illustrations, a real shame as you normally expect a nice book with lots of figures and scenes to help you compose the imaginary world, at the same time that we need a good and easy reading of the many rules, but none of that happen here.

Hated the first training session short game, way way too much randomness.

After playing an actual longer scenario, I don't hate the game anymore, but don't love it either. The followers you are able to hire later and spells/ artifacts/ advanced abilities you get from conquering certain things and leveling up help counter the large amount of randomness that otherwise dominates the game.
Still I would relate the game to a long and complicated version of 7 Wonders, not in game mechanics or theme, but tactics. You cant necessarily have a strategy to start with, nor can you even stick with a certain strategy you have been using through half of the game. Its more about doing the best with what options come available to you. The winner will be based somewhat on that, and somewhat on luck. Seems a bit long of a game for that level of randomness to me, but still fun. I would play again but probably not regularly.

Update (May, 2016):  This is such a hard game to rate.  After playing it a few times right after purchase, it lamented on my shelf for 2 years.  I just recently pulled it out, had to relearn the systems, and played 2 monster solo-games back-to-back.  30 min into the first game, I was all like, "This game is terrible.  Why did I ever rate this so highly?  I'm rulechecking every 5 minutes and it's driving me crazy."  But I persisted.  Ended up maybe winning the first game, if it wasn't for a couple rules infractions (see?).  Decided to load up a 2nd one right away, and i'm glad I did.  IF you have the rules fresh in your head, this game is an amazing solo experience.  So much crunchy decision-making, so much emergent narrative.  Every game different.  I love it.  I just wish I didn't feel like I've never played a "perfect" game (in terms of not breaking any rules).

2013:  Sure, there are a lot of rules to remember, but it's actually not as fiddly as I imagined it would be (less so than Arkham Horror, in my mind).  Watching a play-through online before playing was essential.  I'm glad I purchased it.  My 2nd game took around 5 hours, including set-up, which I consider to be too long.  Maybe I can get this down to 3-4 hrs.   My two games were quite different, largely because of the randomized map and what it gives you.  Surprisingly, I won my first play and nearly won my second - and I don't think I'm getting any major rules wrong.  I "grok" the game and it suits me well - a real brain-burner, where the focus is on efficient use of turns and cards.  Haven't played anything else like it.

This is game is fantastic. It is heavy enough to almost equal a pen and paper fantasy game. Without the stupid books and listening to someone tell you where your location is. Now the rules are many and tiny but they all actually make sense of why they work for the theme. The rules add to the theme. I doubt you will get the game rules right the first couple times of playing. Messing up the rules will not make you want to hate the game. It will help show you how great the game is. the rules help the game. Vlaada Chvátil designed an epic game. He really is an amazing game designer. It is a fun game that you forget your playing a game and get lost in the fantasy theme story.

After around 7-8 games I got really tired of the gameplay. 

You can either make random choices and have fun (which isn't that much of fun with random choices...) or just trying to get the best outcome from your cards which is a very boring and (mathematically) demanding process (and I must say I do like maths ...).

I didn't play the player vs player variants.

Having said that, I really appreciate the attempt and efforts to create this kind of game. I think there is no other game than this that accomplishes the true spirit of an adventure RPG game. Looking forward to something more fun to play.

Played a game and did not find it memorable at all. Too  many fiddly rules and rather long.

In this day and age of 'Oh, look at me! I'm the flavour of the week' games, MK will find it hard to hit the gaming table with friends. It takes too long to explain, takes too long to play and one reviewer suggested it takes 8-10 games to 'get' it.

Who has time? Even FFG dumbed down Descent. 

With games hitting us left-right-centre every OTHER week, it's no wonder that I sold my copy.

My main beef is that friends don't want to invest time to play this game.

After playing this game several times and understanding it, this is the greatest game I've ever played. I bought lost legion shortly after memorizing almost all the rules. I really enjoy the cooperative and solo scenarios. This is the only game I am willing to play solo. I don't recommend going over 3 players for the cooperative scenario because the down time might be too much. Even though this game takes 3 to 5 hours depending on the scenario, I have so much fun that time passes quickly. Truly a masterpiece of modern gaming. The only thing I hate about mage knight is that is makes my other board games feel inferior.

RATING: 6
This game leaves me flat. However, I do not like card driven games either, which Mage Knight basically is. If you expect some kind of old school RPG, you will be disappointed. Your actions to move, combat and buy items will solely depend of the cards you hold in your hand. If you are ok with it, it will be an awesome game. If you expect to move and fight whenever you want, you will have a problem.

It is not complicated game per se, wargames are much more complicated (with countless rules exception). When you got into second or third game, it will just flow naturally. And it is really incredible looking too..

Vlaada Chvátil is one of the most ingenious game designers ever. Mage Knight Board Game is the best Adventure RPG produced. Before this the name Mage Knight invoked images of ugly pre-painted figures along with uninteresting gameplay in my mind. Btw. the figures in MKBG are equally ugly, otherwise the components are nice.

The rules take some time to sink in, and the manuals are not the clearest in some occasions (combat rules anyone?). Eventually you get the hang of it and the game plays very nicely. My only real complaint is the downtime. It can be substantial (I was hanging the laundry and cleaning the bathroom while waiting for my turn).

RATING: 4
Way too heavy for what it does. Looks like an adventure game, but is not. Takes very long and frankly, I do not think it has much reason to do so. There are not many major decisions and the minor decisions are puzzle solving. If you are into micro-managing puzzles, this is the game for you. If not, well - maybe not. 
My feeling is that something like this could be done with much simpler rules. Its more complicated than complex. Its certainly not elegant.

UPDATE: Played it again in June 2014 to test if its good as a solo game. Its still numbercrunching, its still a complicated puzzle, its still extremely fiddly and I still think that the same effect could be achieved by a much simpler design. Its just too much work and then too little result to make it worthwhile.

RATING: 9
This is still early days, but so far I am in love :).

Mage Knight is one of two games that absorb my attention so completely that I don't notice the passage of time at all (the other being High frontier). 

We are still busy working our way through the base game scenarios (currently as far as 'Mines Liberation'), and I find the game an excellent, strategic two player experience.

Will update this in detail as we play more.

Update: Still loving the depth, immersion and strategy that can be found in this game and will be purchasing the upcoming expansion as soon as it is available (though honestly, the game doesn't require it). We are still busy working our way through the basic scenarios after some 4 months, and each play still feels fresh and thematic. 

The beauty of the game lies in the fact that it has a fantasy theme which shines through, but lacks the randomness of Ameritrash games. Everything you do matters. Every hand can be used to further your position (albeit not always in the way you wanted it to). Best of all, despite the games complexity, having learnt it, Mage Knight becomes almost entirely intuitive in terms of keeping track of rules whilst playing.

Update 2: With the expansion this game has managed something extraordinary - it got better! The fact that the co-operative scenarios against Volkare are so enjoyable to me (as someone who usually hates co-op) just adds to the value of this game. We usually play the game co-operatively and tend to ignore end scoring now in scenarios where the objective is to "clear out all the mines" or dungeons or whatever the case may be. Succeed at the mission and its a win for all concerned.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Sounds very promising, some good marks from correlated geekbuddies, and favorable comparisons as a lighter/streamlined Magic Realm-like experience, including solo play.

Several solo conquest games in now.  Love it.  Took maybe 3 games before rules were all straightened out, just due to shear volume.  I don't think I've won legitimately yet but keep wanting to go again.  Just been leaving it set up and playing over long periods of time.  As a solo game I'm obviously way for it.  Should be interesting to finally get some 2+ player games.  Can't see why it wouldn't be at least as good.  Might become one of my favorite games.  Lot's of replay and fun randomness.

2012-11-13

As far as I am concerned this game is a 10 for me now after many solo plays.  I'll keep the overall rating at an 8 for now and possibly bump it up when I have more multi-player games (just one so far)

Update: One 3 player game went pretty well, but one player isn't a gamer so we played co-op and basically just played for him.  Other friend was really into it.

3 more 2 player co-op games went well.  Safe at a 9 overall I'd say.  Not sure if it deserves a 10 or not yet.

Update 2017-11:  Haven't played this one in a while as I'm not really doing solo games and I don't really have a strong desire to get this one out when I am going to play a longer game with others.  Need to give this another go and see if it holds up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'd probably rate this higher if it weren't for 2 things:

1) It takes a long time to play.  While it's not "tedious" long, it's a bit too long to fit easily into a busy schedule, and so it doesn't see as much play.

2) While I appreciate Vlaada's efforts in the storyline, it just doesn't feel like "Mage Knight" to me, based on the original minis game.  Rather, it's more like "a game loosely based on Mage Knight".

The gameplay is fun, though, and definitely very tight.  You have to manage your hand well to succeed in this game, something I've not quite mastered yet.

I'll admit, I don't like it nearly as much in multiplayer mode because unless the players are really evenly matched, the worse player is just going to fall behind early with really no chance of ever catching up, and the good player is just going to take all the juicy stuff along the way and leave the lesser player with the dregs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Initial rating after 1 full play and a solo walkthrough.  Excellent rpg-style boardgame with all the necessary bells and whistles.  The main innovation here is the use of your hand of cards to limit your actions for the turn.  Your deck size controls how long a day/night lasts.  Makes every turn a tense puzzle-like experience with some angst as if you don't cycle through your deck in the full turn, you may be left behind.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Buying this purely for the solo really.  I can't imagine ever getting this to a table with other friends. I have an ex-RPG'er fantasy adventure itch that needs scratching and this looks like a good option.

Very positive impressions after 2 training games. Hard, but not clunky. Quite a few rules lookups at first but the system makes sense.

The 'game timer' seems really short - I feel like I'm having to sprint around to complete the game in the alloted time, rather than explore fully. Perhaps a 'Solo Conquest' game with 6 rounds will be different.

Edit after four games... I'm giving this a 9.  I love it. The only thing stopping it getting a 10 is the slight anti-climax when you fail to win.  You have 1 or 2 turns left to take the final city... and you look at your spent skills and units and useless cards and think 'there's just no way I can win'.  It's a real balance between moving fast enough to reach the cities in time, and gaining enough 'stuff' to actually win when you get there!

A beautiful scenario-based RPG in a box! I am impressed with how this game challenges you to squeeze every bit of utility out of your deck. Vlaada Chvátil thought of seemingly everything: a "clock" to ensure the speed of solo play, a huge variety of combat mechanics, different ways to build strength, etc.

I have yet to play Mage Knight through without making any rules mistakes. After a few plays, the core gameplay becomes very intuitive, though there always seem to be corner cases that need to be resolved.

I've only played the game solo thus far. I doubt I will ever play it multiplayer, which is fine with me, as I only got the game for solo play. I'm interesting in trying out the Lost Legion expansion after a few more plays of the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a classic Vlaada game. Play it, check rulebook for any mistakes you made, play it again, check the rulebook again, play it, check FAQ, play it etc. For some reason I find Vlaada Chvatil's games to be the most difficult to internalise the rules for. There's a high barrier of entry, making it difficult to bring new players to the table. 

I still have to give credit where it's due, and there's a lot of credit due here. The game is full of clever ideas, there's so much content you will have to play it a lot to even begin to grasp the tactics, the experience is always memorable. I just wish it didn't come at the cost of rules obfuscation.

Olyan semleges várakozással ültem le ahhoz a játékhoz, ami egy év alatt beverekedte magát a top tízbe. Nem vártam se sokat, se keveset. Nagyon kellemes meglepetés a játék. Teljesen érthető a nagy rajongás iránta. 4 fajta kalandozó van, akiknek egy kivételével teljesen ugyanolyan 16 kezdőpaklija van. Ezzel tudunk mindent csinálni a játék során. Lépünk, harcolunk, befolyást szerzünk, varázsolunk. Ezen túl abban különböznek a varázslóink, hogy szintlépéssekkor különböző tulajdonságokkal fognak rendelkezni. Pont jó a különbözőség-hasonlóság mértéke véleményem szerint. Thunderstone szerű a lapmenedzselés. 5 lapból kell valamit alkotnunk a körünkben, de nem vészes a pakliépítés része, mert bővülni a kártyáink csak szintlépéskor, illetve adott helyen való lapvásárlással tudnak. Nekem ez is pontosan megfelelő mértékű. Kezelhető. Jó a harcrendszer, jó a manaszerzés és használat lehetősége. Minden kártyának van egy alaptulajdonsága, adott színű mana felhasználásával pedig egy erősebb. Nem éreztem nagy szerencsefaktort sem, mert nem lesz óriási a paklink a játék során így mindig tudunk valamit csinálni a körünkben. Érdekes a felfedezés is, a sok különböző szörny és épület. Valahogy megint sikerült a cseh szerzőnek jól eltalálnia minden mértéket. Nagyon tetszett a Mage Knight, eddigi legjobb játék, amit az ilyen típusú fantasy játékok közül láttam. Egy negatívumot találtam elsőre a nagy holtidőt és sajnos amíg másik játékos lép szerintem keveset lehet előre gondolkozni, mert cselekvésétől és a körönként egy közös manahasználat miatt nem mindegy milyen lehetőség marad nekünk és aszerint kell terveznünk. Tehát tényleg ketten lehet a legjobb és négyen már nagyon hosszúra nyúlhat. Nagyon erős 8-as.

A fantastic implementation, taking the best of card drafting mechanics to finally produce an adventure game which is actually strategic. Down one notch because of the bland fantasy setting, the somewhat uninspired scenarios, and the fact that the game is exclusively centred on fighting (which I don't mind per se, but I could see potential for much more with such a system). I reckon my opinion might change again if I'll ever get to play the really competitive scenarios, which might be where this game really shines.

RATING: 7
Excellent game, really satisfying to upgrade your deck and units and work your way through the board. Long and pretty complicated but very worth it if you are playing with the right people. Haven't played competitively yet. A few issues with complicated rules and the stamina it takes to learn and play the game, but obviously gets easier and faster and more rewarding the more you learn the game and the more fluent it becomes. Unfortunately can't help but feel like it is missing something, something that could've rounded it off perfectly and made it into a 10/10 game.

A top 10 game.  I wish I knew more people who played this.  While the PvP is nonsense, everything else about this game is perfect.  The expansions make it even better.  I love the essential choice of playing a card now or waiting to play it later for a stronger effect at the cost of momentum in your card draw.  More over, the other players, by playing faster or slower, will reign that choice in and make the game that much harder.

This game gets better with each play.  Possibly Vlaada's best (and that's saying something).  Each round is like a mini-puzzle you need to solve with the cards you draw and you tailor each of those puzzles to your liking with the deck-building aspect. It works on every level.

Edit: Moved up to a 10 after picking up the expansion.  One of the best games out there!

Mage Knight may be the most complex game I own, but it's simply amazing. The card play and customization is so satisfying. The production, despite some small issues, is also very good. This is the closest I've seen anyone come to replicating a video game RPG in board game form. There are a few things that hold it back from perfection for me: 1) It's really long. I think my first play was 8 hours and that was solo. I can finish a game quicker now, but it's still a good 3 hours. I can't even imagine a four-player game of this. 2) There isn't much variety in terms of scenarios. They are all pretty much the same thing and there are few that I find engaging or interesting. 3) It's a lot to setup and it takes up a lot of table space. It takes some time to get this game ready and I normally prefer to start playing as quickly as possible. Still, this is an excellent design and one of my favorite "heavy" games.

Undoubtedly the learning curve to wrap your head around all the interlocking parts is a bit overwhelming initially, but it is all pretty intuitive so it isn't that nutty.  This pretty much is a streamlined Magic Realm.  It is rather surprising how quickly you go through your deck.  The game clips along nicely and you constantly feel the friction of the design.  You really need to ramp up quickly otherwise the low hanging fruit is gone and it can be tough to tackle some of the mid level monsters.

Even as things chug along, you really feel the friction of the system, but it is fun to push against it trying to figure out the puzzle to get ahead.

A magnificent creation, intricate with inventiveness,and depth. Read the pamphlets a few times slowly before opening wrapped pieces & cards. The thought that went into it is imagination on a high plain. A real gem.

This takes a good deal of time to get into, and remember all the rules, and a lot of space is needed.

The lack of any randomness in the fights, hinders my feelings for it.

After I got Runebound 3rd edition, I didn't want to play Mage Knight anymore. I prefer the stories and battles in that game more.

Really great combination of different mechanics (deckbuilding, adventuring, roleplaying). Takes one or two playthroughs to grasp, but is good fun afterwards. After five rounds I fear that it might get repetitive after some more, but on the other hand the downtime issue is definitely not as bad as other voters make it seem to be, because once everyone can plan their turn in advance during the other player's turns, the turns get quicker and you have something to do while your opponents are making their moves.

Further Edit: After a couple more games I need to tone down my vote - it is indeed quite repetitive. Also it is too complex for relatively low strategic depth.

I highly recommend watching Ricky Royal's walkthrough on youtube  as the rulebook will suddenly become a lot easier to understand and open the way to an excellent solo game   
   Getting better the more I play it, well worth the effort to learn it properly to get the most out of the game.
  I will add that although it can be played multi player and PvP I would not rate it anywhere near as highly and would probably only give it a 6 for 3 or more players.
    If you are looking for a multi player fantasy themed dungeon type game then go for Descent instead as Mage Knight will just give you a long game with a lot of downtime and very little interaction rather like 3-4 solo games that are being played out on the same board

Wow -- I just don't get what all the fuss is about. Reading the reviews, you would think "you make the most of what you have" was a revolutionary new game idea, not the stuff of dusty, luck-driven children's games. Dry, repetitive gameplay, arbitrary theme, frustrating mechanics, and a whole lot more luck than the fanboys like to admit. Definitely not an adventure game, as I understand the term, and not a very good deck-builder, either. Copious downtime extinguishes any sparks of pleasure this tedious stinker might otherwise provide. 

A soulless and pointless game that would have been ignored from any other designer.

Just played the learning walkthrough and then one full solo game. Took WAY too long. The rules are pretty bad. I mean, conceptually they're good, but you shouldn't have to look in either the rulebook, the walkthrough, or the dozen player aid cards to find which blinking rule you need. (If you find it even then. Too many trips to BGG or the FAQ.). I've seen fans defend the rules, but they're fans, which is to say fanatics. I did download a 2-page player aid that helped a lot, but it only went so far. Harumph.

Thematically it's a puzzle, not an adventure game. The theme came through medium ok. There were monsters. There were cities and tombs etc etc. But... The cards are pretty cool, both units and spells, they're the best thing thematically. The world is generic. Terrain has no special names and cities are called Red City and White City etc. The heroes you pick have names and backstories but they're very cliche backstories. So B- on theme. 

The game, however, ah, the game. THAT was fun. I'm not a super puzzle guy, or maybe I am. In my early turns the puzzles were simple. As your Mage Knight gets more powerful (better cards and skills) the tricks and combos you can pull are pretty cool, and the puzzles get harder. My final battle in my solo game took a LOT of thought but was great when I pulled it off. (Assuming I did. I'm hoping I didn't make any rules mistakes. I feel a little nervous that I won my first solo game, albeit on a low difficulty level and only on the last possible turn.)

So an 8 right now. It's clearly going to be a beast to get to the table but I'm intrigued by the challenge of it. There's also a lot of variety with various extra scenarios and the expansions.

Awesome game. Absolutely great gameplay. Solo game is fantastic as well. Deep gameplay in a very slick design.

The one negative I have is that the rulebook/walkthrough sure made this game much more difficult to learn than need be.

I like the fact that while I play this game I don't have to maintain a player card with all my stats displayed.  Your hand of cards are your stats.  But there is still plenty of stuff, cards, counters, dice, chits, score tracks etc. sitting around the playing area.  This is a pretty elegant game, yet still is cluttered.  I think the game world has maxed out on the managed-depth-to-clutter ratio.   Until game components start to appear with embedded microprocessors and neat little digital displays that change to show current stats, this is the limit.   Nevertheless, this is an excellent game.  I've enjoyed it very much.  Combat is abstracted in such a way that each battle is presented to the player as an individual puzzle requiring a judicious combination of card plays to ensure that multiple features can be activated, usually optimized by a distinct linear timing sequence which is critical.  Very clever.  Not quite the "blow by blow" experience of Magic Realm that creates a visceral sense of immediate peril, but this is close.  Much more engaging during combat than, say, Runebound. 
- I've played 7 or 8 solo games so far.  It is definitely a "self improvement" sport.  With every game you get a little better, get a little farther and have a little more fun.  It makes you want to play more.   I think it would be a good two-player game, as well.  But I can see how three or four players could drag the game endlessly.  I cannot endure a game where I sit for 10-15 minutes between turns.  
(Note: I downgraded the game from a 9.0 because of several recent games in which the card draws were so very bad in terms of not providing even basic movement cards in multiple, subsequent turns, requiring sideways cards that just make no sense thematically.   The luck of the draw can definitely put a sour taste in the mouth.  I know the game is about playing the hand you're dealt but c'mon.)

This game is great. The puzzle level of this, and the amount of actual calculations in your head makes this a real challenge every time. 

Playing competitive this game isn’t where the game shines. For me the amount of luck involved is huge (even though, the calculative part of the game makes you feel a eurogamer) and at times makes the competition a joke.

Dont get me wrong as I love this game I just recommend playing this cooperatively (especially against the big guy) 

I should mention that this is a heavy game. Mechanically there’s a lot going on and it will take LONG. But it rocks.

Truly the adventure game we have all been wanting all our lives. Know that if you play with more than, well...yourself...it's gonna be a long one. But really folks, it is so filled with depth, and exploration, and gaming goodness that it is totally worth the time. But it's best with 2 or 3 max, in my opinion. For solo play, its my absolute favorite. 

I have to say, when you have a bunch of units, spells, advanced action cards,etc. and you're attacking three or so foes - it gets really complicated, really quick. There are so many undulations of the battle system, and so many ways you can manipulate your cards to fight, that it becomes very much a trial and error puzzle - and that can make players turns reaaaaaaallllly long. This, in my opinion - and I hate to say this - is a design flaw for sure. Don't get me wrong though - I absolutely love this game to death (its a ten...) but, the system of battle should really be tweaked so that it doesn't turn into a big logic puzzle that takes so long to figure out. Im not sayin' you should just throw some dice - I like the system - but it needs a serious streamlining and an elegance check. I mean, I would love to play this game with 4 - but as is - no way will I be doing that again.

Great RPG style game (which is one of my favorite types of games).  Most cards, especially spells and advanced actions cards, have several lines of text and because of this the game is prone to AP with some players. I do believe that with repeated plays the AP problem should lessen.  This game has a lot going on and can be difficult for non-gamers to pick up but then again for gamers it is chock full of options...in fact so many that the game has rules for "reverting" a play as long as nothing was "revealed" (i.e a dice role or new card wasn't drawn that turn).  I really enjoy it and it plays well solo which is a BIG PLUS for me since it might be harder to fine gamers that are willing to take the plunge.

I want to like this game, as it's top 10 and I think it has a number of really good mechanics. However, I've never been much of a fan of deckbuilders, which this is one, and I found that much of the game I struggled to do what I wanted, and that by the time I had built up a character to be somewhat strong, the game was over. It also took a long time and I didn't feel that I had a lot of compelling decisions within it. I didn't feel like I was building up a character, either, so I failed to stay engaged in the game while I was playing it. Still, as a highly-rated and popular game, I want to try it again and see if I'd like it a bit more.

RATING: 3
Long and complex, Mage Knight is an impressive design, but it's not worth the length or the learning curve. There's little interaction or excitement and a lot of downtime. Either you methodically run through and calculate your next turn while others are taking theirs, to the extent you can, in which case you might as well be playing alone, or you really get into it and pay attention to what your opponents are doing, exacerbating downtime for others. I don't usually enjoy games that play as well or better solo than they do with others, and that's true of Mage Knight. A 4p game was easily one of my worst gaming experiences, one I will not endure again.

I don't give out a lot of 10s in my ratings...  But holy smokes does Mage Knight ever deserve it.  This game offers the best solo-player board game experience that I can imagine.  (Edit: readjusted to 9.5)

I've played it with another person once and it was great.   We both basically just went off and played as solo players though...  on the same map, but avoiding one another's progress.

Played once with a borrowed copy. Takes a long time to get through and I still didn't have a good sense of the strategy by the end. Seems like there's potential here, but not sure if it's worth it. Having someplace to leave it set-up between sessions might help. Staying up late and playing tired are not advised for this very complex game.

RATING: 8
Pros
- Puzzle-y mechanics through hand management are SO much fun
- The slight deckbuilding mechanics make you really feel like you are getting stronger as you play
- Good replayability due to variability of characters, cards, and randomized options that show up on the board

Cons
- The rules in this game are needlessly complex to the point of absurdity. It took me hours of watching videos, reading rules, and mock games to feel like I understood how to play. It is the opposite of "elegant."
- Playing with any more than 2 people and I imagine the down time between turns would be excruciating.
- Setup and game length cause this game to get to the table much less often than I'd like

I really enjoy this game when I want a really think, crunchy game. Rules complexity, setup time, and game length are unnecessary barriers to entry here, but once you get past those this is a fantastic game that is fun to play from beginning to end.

RATING: 10
Holy crap, this is a monster of a game and somehow still all the elements are so well designed and the game is kept interesting and loads of fun.

The game is a weird amalgam of a deck-building game and a fantasy adventure game with about a million other elements mixed in to the most elegant well-designed game system I've ever seen.  Make no mistake, trying to understand the rules yourself, let alone trying to explain them to others who have the patience to learn and understand those rules is a chore but one that is well worth it.

The game is a decent length (probably about an hour per player give or take depending on the scenario and the players) and very complicated and requires keeping a lot of balls in the air to play but I don't think there is a single element that I'm not a fan of.  The only downside to the game is that because of its length and complexity the opportunities to play it aren't as many as I would like.  The balance and increasing power levels of the basic and advanced actions, spells, and artifacts and the ability to use any card as one of four basic effects provides a wealth of strategic options and variety each turn.  The magic system is unique and balanced.  The spacial and time (day/night rounds) system adds another delicious layer to the game.  The monsters are varied and balanced against the increasing power of your heroes.  The leveling system is deep and also unique (especially the ability to take skills from your opponent).  The wound system is punishing without being crippling.  And most of all it is engrossing, thematic, and fun, fun, fun!

I am thoroughly impressed with what Chvatil was able to accomplish here.  I've seen games not 1/100th the complexity of Mage Knight unable to properly balance and blend two mechanics let alone the machination he was able to create here that does it all to absolute perfection without feeling like a chore.  Quite the contrary, one of my new favorite games!

I will say though that the rushed components really pissed me off.  Because of how much I love this game I would have loved it if it looked nice.  The enemy tokens are all horribly printed/cut to where some actually have vital information obscured.  Some of the cards are the same way and are also oddly sized so it is difficult to sleeve them well.

This rate is more for the game than from the player (me) that plays it. I don't enjoy playing fantasy themed Games. Other than that Mage Knight has some good ideas and, above all, it is very well structured. 
Down time is an issue. Too much down time. It also has the dull and boring starting problem in my opinion. It takes too long to start showing and that makes the game even more boring in the next plays. This doesn't mean it doesn't have different strategies to follow, it means that reaching an interesting place during play takes longer than should.

Best singleplayer game I have ever tried. As you play you are constantly planning how to use all your cards in the most efficient way possible. Overall a very exciting, time consuming and puzzling game. It will provide some amount of frustration while you attempt to learn all the many, many rules but it is definitely worth it.

I have yet to play the multiplayer version so I cannot comment on that however I could see a few issues arising where players have too much downtime or some runaway leader problems could occur.

What I've found interesting about Mage Knight is that it shouldn't feel as immersive and thematic as it does--it's a brutal optimization puzzle from the get-go when played solo. But it feels like I'm in for such a long haul, such an uphill fight as I look down at all those tokens and cards and think and think and think on each turn, that I start to feel like a war-weary knight in a world that wants to kill me, so it winds up being strangely absorbing. In the end, I'm not convinced the decision to marry a voluminous rules set with gameplay so tight that slight fuzziness in rules knowledge can have such harsh effects is great game design. When something demands this much methodical calculation and logic and mastery of all your options, I feel the rules should be greatly slimmed down; as Mage Knight stands, it's just crazy cognitive overload of a kind I kind abide. But obviously there are other people who can handle it all quite well.

Not sure there is 60 Euros of game in the box components wise, but the game play (Dominion meets outdoors Adventure) looks engrossing. The walk through is a hell of a long read, but gives a good feeling for the game. Very much looking forward to first outing

Revised view after a play - its worth the 60 Euros and more. unbelievably challenging, hybrid Euro /Ameritrash, huge number of possibilities.

Its taken me all week of rules reading to get into a position to play - and then when we started playing we needed to constantly to refer to the walkthrough and rule book. Not bad rules, just the amount of stuff the game throws at you and I have not taken on ruins or cities or PvP or a fraction of the powers.

I would never want to teach this from scrath

Its interesting that now a second of the great designers (the first being Wallace's 'A few Acres of snow') has felt inspired to use the build a deck mechanic of Dominion in a design

This is a hard game to rate. On the one hand, the game mechanics are fantastic, on the other hand, the game is too complex to either introduce new casual players or to just remember all the rules. The card building system is where this game shines the most IMO. Leveling up is quite gratifying, you get a bit of a power trip as you gain experience and a better deck.  It's easy to immerse yourself in the game and your character. My only know is the complexity of it all. I know most people enjoy this game as a solo game mostly because having extra players has some considerable down time, but I'm lucky enough to be able to play this game with my wife as she is a fan. 2-player is quite a blast, but both players need to be really versed with the rules in order to have fun. So, I guess my rating is a bit 2 tier: 9/10 for the game mechanics ans fun factor, but only a 5/10 because of the complexity.

This is as good as advertised.  It is very reminiscent of Runebound, in the sense you have a character roaming the land and getting increasingly stronger.  The similarity ends there.  Vlaada Chavatil does a masterful job of integrating a card driven system to this genre.  Each decision is tough and meaningful and not at all scripted.  You are constrained with the cards you have but have ample choices in how to proceed.   The integration of solo rules along with a Co-OP mode makes this game accessible to many more situations.  Brilliant.

Struggling with this game, it's a tad too complex for me to be able to just get it on the table and get going. By the time I've set it up and re read the rules, I've burnt a couple of hours! I am keen to get over the learning curve so I can just play the game, rather than do me over with its rulebook

Mage Knight is remarkably good for solo play; it doesn't feel all that different from multiplayer (probably because there's not a whole lot of interaction unless you use player-vs-player combat, which I haven't done yet.)

Each turn seems like its own little puzzle of how best to use your cards; can you manage to move over to there AND defeat that enemy?  However, if you focus on the puzzle aspect and just concentrate on maximizing each turn, you'll neglect the higher-level planning and fall behind.  Likewise, if you concentrate on playing "perfectly" and avoid ever getting wounded, you'll also fall behind.  Wounds are something to take when necessary and work around, not something to avoid at all costs.

One BGG member explained that Mage Knight provides randomization of [i]opportunity[/i], not (usually) of [i]outcome[/i].  So you don't know what you're going to draw for your next turn, or what monsters are waiting at the next altar.  But once you see them, you can plan out and fight them with no uncertainty (except in the case of a summoner).

I also appreciate that there are any number of viable builds for your hero, which are partially guided but not limited by your unique action and your skills; also by what actions and spells come up and what you have the chance to buy.  I've played several solo games and never had the same kind of character by the end.

Reading the comments for the low ratings, I actually agree with a lot of them.  Horrible rulebook?  Check.  Forcing click-miniatures in when they don't need to be there?  Check.  Lots of downtime?  Mostly check; this shouldn't really be played with four, or even three if they're newbs.

Then there are those who complain about it being too random.  I don't understand that.  Just about everything you do in the game is deterministic.  But as I said above, the opportunities are randomized.  I guess that's not for everyone.  I suspect that if I play this with my Ameritrash-loving friends, they'll complain that it's not random enough!  EDIT: And indeed they do!

Vlaada Chvatil is one of my favourite designers, and I REALLY wanted to like this game, but was very disappointed.  The first time I played I played with a group and the second time was solo pay and each time it was a drudgery to play.  I cannot imagine what people see in this game.

Crazy-fun and challenging. And long. But we knew that going in, didn't we? The components are fantastic, the gameplay is smart and complex, and the replayability is near endless. The only reason I don't give this a 9 or 10, is the length and complexity limits the number of players that will play and due to those same factors I can't get to it as much as I'd like.

Super great adventure game.  I haven't played it solo because I don't play games solo unless I am trying to figure them out, but if I was going to play a game solo, it would be this one.

Great deckbuilding and turns that make your head hurt.  It is really multiplayer solitaire for the most part, but brilliant them integration means that you feel like you are roaming around the countryside.  I think that 2 players is the sweetspot here, three players are doable and with four players I would be asking why not break out TI3?

My favorite game by this designer.

My 9 is based only on solo play. I don't think I will ever play this in a group. As a solo game it has everything I want: growing board, some luck (card draws, dice rolls, terrain tile selection), the ability to develop a character, and really fun logic puzzles. There is a real sense of risk and reward when hidden information is encountered. There are so many paths to follow in each game, it doesn't matter that most of the information is revealed. It's about looking about what you have and figuring out the best way to marshal your resources and achieve your goal.

Almost the most fun you can have when you're alone.

Thus far I have only played solo and 2 player.  Right now ar least, the 2 player matches are less fun as one of the players always crushes the other.  This seems to be primarily because of 3 factors; 1 - The player with the first turn has a significant advantage on the (2) constrained first scenario map.  3 - if you have an unlucky streak and your movement is low, you lose.

RATING: 7
It's one of the deepest solitaire strategy games in existence. The co-op/competitive multiplayer scenarios just add to the depth. 

But it has some big problems: lengthy set-up and tear-down time, some easily forgotten rules (divided unhelpfully across 2 separate books), and a difficulty level akin to the Dark Souls series--except you'll find yourself in some situations where you really can't do anything. When it clicks it feels great, but often it's just an unwinnable slog.

RATING: 6
Deckbuilding adventure game where each player controls a questing Mage Knight, wandering around the map looting tombs, recruiting followers, burning down monasteries and so forth. Card play is complex: each hand-card has six abilities, a normal one and a stronger effect that requires an additional payment (usually mana, but in the case of artifacts, permanent loss of the card), and the possibility to be played for a single point in any of the key "currencies": movement, influence, attack, block.

The deckbuilding does provide a very clever character development mechanism -- levelling up or acquiring new equipment provides superior cards -- but on its own it is a fairly weak implementation. (Card cycling is too infrequent for new hand cards to provide the same degree of accelerating improvement as in Dominion et al.) That is not a criticism per se, because deckbuilding is only one part of a player's engine. Recruited units are kept face up and can be used once per round; likewise, character skills acquired when levelling up can be used either once a round or once a turn. Mana crystals can be kept and used to power spells. Players also draft "tactics" cards, which in addition to setting turn order also provide special abilities. The combination of all of these game elements makes for an exceedingly rich hand- and resource-management experience.

As might be surmised, movement points are required to move: 2 points per plains, 3 per hill, 5 per swamp etc. It's [i]expensive[/i]. Moving to, or in some cases adjacent to, a special location allows the character to interact there. Block points are needed to avoid taking damage in combat with monsters, attack points to kill them, and influence points to recruit followers. Managing resources such that it is possible to both move to a desired location and do something useful is a complex optimization puzzle.

Thanks to the luck of the cards, it's sometimes an optimization puzzle that can't be solved for the result you want; at a strategic level, the game is about building an engine and moving around such that opportunities for success are maximized. Early plays are far more likely to have useless and frustrating "I can't move anywhere!" turns.

Unfortunately, the puzzle is also a largely solitary one, though other players are useful both provide time pressure and some direct interaction through PvP. Frequently, though, you will have very little interest in what other players are up to.

(It hardly bears mentioning, but as with similar games in this genre, theme is only there if you squint; it's not one to play for the story. Get an RPG.)

I'm just not convinced. Mage Knight asks some difficult questions, but not terribly interesting ones, and it asks them over a long, fiddly, themeless session.

Interesting combos, nice gameplay, great adventuring feeling.
I'm not sure yet if there are as many choices for deckbuilding as i would like. 
It seems like only a few and mostly random cards are added into your deck.
Even so i like this a lot.

I still want to play it more and i still haven't seen all cards, artifacts, combos and scenarios.

After 25 plays i think i will be playing this game for a long time... There are so many aspects of this game to explore and discover.

Rating increases to 8.5
The only downside i can find is that sometimes all you want is a move card but all you get is a bunch of influence which will be missed if discarded for movement.

Great theme play!  Need a few plays to get the rules down pat.  Game has some interesting mechanics, and is very challegening.  Would like to have more opportunites to draw cards during play.  Don't care much for the PvP, since the game already makes it difficult to accomplish tasks.  Components are awesome - colorful thick cardboard modular board, plastic playing pieces, durable cards (great artwork) and well written rulebook.  Game length depends on the scenario but is generally very long (2.5 hours minimum).

A little overwhelming at first but all the rules make sense and after a few games it gets much easier to go through a game. I've play about 4 games 3 solo and one with buddies.

It just takes too long to play this game... I am thinking whether we can speed up the things at all.

There are quite many minutes rules to explain.  It isn't a game that is easy to teach.

The choice of color at the city base is hard to see but the components are gorgeous!  They should make the shape of Orc and Draconian look different than others to make it easier for players to read that those two will trigger challenge and the other locations need to enter in order to kill.

If you are new to the game, much of what John Sizemore writes in his quite elaborate review is true:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/800679/an-adventure-game-with-no-surprises-a-negative-rev

However, I do not want to give it as low a rating as this reviewer.

If you play with 2 players max there is some good gaming in there.
Killing monsters is the most important thing to go for in the early game. That makes playing a bit one-dimensional. 

Update (03/2014):
After a dozen additional games I am finally beginning to see the beauty of this game - as a solitaire endeavour at least. It's still damn long.

Perfect single player game.

Hard to rate. This is too long and too complicated...but its good. There's a lot of variety of things to do, and tons of ways to customize your characters with skills and followers. I really enjoy playing it, but I have a hard time seeing playing it other than just 2 player.

I have a very hard time keeping track of all the rules in this game. Lots of locations look very similar, and the cards aren't easy to reference. Abilities work different ways at different times (like resistances). I'd like it a lot more if it were a lot less fiddly and confusing.

The most overrated game ever. It is a terribly restrictive puzzle that forces you to think for 10 minutes about how to move your character one hex forward and another 10 minutes on how to beat the enemy.

It outstays its welcome by about 5 hours, during which, you just want to blow your brains out.

The rulebook for this game might be the worst one I have ever read. Rules are spread out, and randomly placed in one of the two "rule books". I had seriously a much harder time understanding the simple rules in mage knight than the complex rules in "The rublic of rome" which has a 50 page long rulebook. 
Once you have an understanding of the relative simple rules in this game it is a fun game, but suffers from a "snowball" effect. If you do not have a good start you may never come back into the game because the other players take all the loot. 
I once had a game where I got last pick on starting positions, and started out last of 4 players. The other players moved out and basically blocked me in such a way that I could not get any experience on my hero on the first turn (and I could not even take a double turn to secure something). At the start of my second turn the other players had once again taken the experience I could have taken. From that point (at the start of the second turn) it was clear that I could never win this game because of the snowball effect.

A fun game for non competative play, and a seriously flawed game for competative play.

Quote from skipsizemores review:

"I really did not find much to like about Mage Knight: Board Game. It's dull, themeless, and processional. It offers very little fun in return for the great amount of time one spends learning it, setting it up, and waiting for others to puzzle out their turns. It's the least adventuresome adventure game I've ever played."

Amazing game with a ton of depth, strategy, and replay value. It takes a bit of time to learn, but it's not nearly as difficult to get into as I've heard a lot of reviewers say. It's a very deep and rewarding play experience - think of it as a self-contained RPG that you can start and finish within 2-4 hours, depending on the scenario and how much time you take with your turns (I've only played it solo so far). Follow the walkthrough scenario and take it slow with the first few games; after that, everything will come as second nature and the play experience will be smooth and deeply engaging.

Each and every time I get ready to play Mage Knight, I get so excited! Firstly, just thinking about the concepts and mechanisms gives me a huge urge to play, and I wonder why this game never hits the table.
Then I ask others to play it with me... why do I always end up playing this one solo? Oh well, the game has solo rules, so I am going to play the crap out of it all by my damn self! 
I start to set it up, and now my excitement is palpable! Look at all of these super cool components! Oooh man is this going to rock!
Then I start to play the actual game. This is the exact moment that the experience falls absolutely flat for me. In my very humble opinion, this is a quasi deck building Euro style game with a rich fantasy theme. Unfortunately, it fails on every front with my group and even me. I want to like this game so badly!

RATING: 6.1
My first play was overly long with 2 hours of rules explanations before we played, followed by additional new rules for every tile.

For the amount of time to learn and the number of bits involved, there are very few actual choices in the game, at least meaningful ones and a lot of down time between turns. 

In one round, I used the last of my cards and so had to wait for 3 other players to take a turn, then passed to end the round and then everyone else got a turn. Then, the new round started and I was going 4th, so had another three turns of doing nothing. In all, it seemed like all I said or did for about 45 minutes was 'I pass, ending the round'. I'm keen to play this again to see if it improves, but colour-me disappointed.

Update: On a second play, with only one new player, there was less downtime, but still too much for my tastes and still not enough interesting things going on.

Heavy game with lots of details to take into account.
Our first games always got some rules we forgot to apply.

Deck building according to your strategy to meet the scenario's target, but you have to take your surroundings into account.

Interesting decisions along the way, but rather long gameplay needed to develop your strategy.

Amazing solitaire game if you have a some hours to learn and some more to play. Great replayability and ajustable difficulty.

Multiplayer can take a long time, specially for more than 2 people. That's a pity since is in the competitive modality where the game shines in all its esplendor. However, solitaire mode is still great.

***********

After some time;

This game gets better when you invest more time in it. The game is great as solitaire (specially if you add the expansion), but it is better as competitive, specially with 2 players.

As competitive, it has some design problems (AP, downtime, unpayable with different skilled people); if played with more than 2, it has more problems (one player can easily get behind, with any chance to do anything; few interaction; luck factor in the first 10 minutes determining the fate of the game...). However, it also provides much more to the game. It gives more dynamism, it makes you reconsider you strategy every turn.

For me, the game is better as 2 players: in that case, downtime and AP is minimized. The game interaction is maximal. And if one player gets too strong, the other can resign and start another game.

For me it isn't a masterpiece. It really has some important problems. However, it's a nice game to play, very original and fun.

RATING: 8
Mix of adventure game and euro. It really works.

The game is long, but you have a lot to do. Deckbuilding is not so strong. The`re only few rounds, so you don`t will use your new cards often.

Some problems - When you have wounds you need time to heal, but you have not much time in the game. So every wound hurts you very much, unless you can cure fast. Your fun from the game also decreases, because you new your next turns will be only healing and the other players can play and have fun. 

Second think are the rules. There`re some small rules easy to forget, like the resistance to range attack in many places. I don1t like that the figting rules among players are different, than against neutral opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The rules may seem daunting, but the rule book is very well laid out and understanding Mage Knight seems to be mostly about retaining a lot of data (and of course the pertinent exceptions) more than anything being unclear or hard to comprehend, though the combat is cluttered and my least favorite thing about the game.  The variables in each turn are cool and the limited progress on the board and the acknowledgement of terrains and time of day give nice sense of scope. At it worst, which is the combat part, this game has the same problem of playing a high level character in an RPG: too much time dealing with modifiers and not enough time in the world making character-driven decisions.
Yet ideas like wounds limiting a player's options (hand size) and resurfacing if not properly tended (in the next round in a new deck) and the alteration of day and night and the handling of the units are all very good conceits, as is the ability to explore certain sites deeper or chose to forego such explorations while sticking to a different agendum.
Mage Knight is not as good as my favorite game, which is Cave Evil by a significant margin, but I appreciate the well conceived solo mode of this thing. Grand, patient fantasy from Vlaada Chvátil when things aren't getting too bogged down with modifier accounting.

   This, and LOTR LCG, are my favourite games.

  Mage Knight, is fantastic. I would play it anytime or anywhere, I like it that much. Perhaps the best combination of an old school RPG where you play a character who travels the land fighting monsters and levelling up. But the components are so fantastic, that it represents the best of modern gaming.
   I would suggest getting someone to teach you the game, as I found learning that way a real pleasure. And I watched Richard Ham's run through before playing, so I had an idea of what to do.
  My only regret is that I waited so long to try this game!

Actual rating is a split 5/8. In an optimal configuration, on its best day, it's an 8. And even that is padded with a bonus for cleverness. On its worst day, or foolishly with four players, it can sink to a 5. After four plays, I've yet to witness the game overcome its base fantasy-themed puzzle nature. For all the detail and "theme", it has a surprising lack of emotional engagement or narrative element. Tension doesn't build, or careen about like a rollercoaster. You're plodding through a fantasy world wearing an Amulet of Angst.

What rescues the game is that the card-driven engine is clever, the several ways in which your character powers up provides for satisfying growth, and the card play itself is frequently (though not always) interesting.

Shocking that anyone finds this well designed.  Basically take a bunch of incompatible mechanics and shove them into a game and then shove some more in.  So much down time you could play a couple of other games between turns.  The combat system is so uninteresting: there is no calculated risk, just look at the enemy and decide how much damage you are willing to take, of course that is after you've consulted the charts to figure out what the damn symbols mean.  Not that it's interesting once you find out.  And are we even playing with each other?  All interaction is collateral.  Like a bunch of people playing solitaire together.  The WORST part is the movement.  As if it isn't annoying enough as it is not having a lot of movement options, when it is "night" it gets even worse.  Note to adventure game designer: There is nothing interesting about moving.  There is so much pain and effort put into moving that you want to cry.  Just let me move!!!  "Sure, I am a great sorcerer warrior but somehow I can't walk through the forest at night because I don't have the right movement cards."  I have the power to assault the Wizard's Tower, but fear not, minions of the dark, this stretch of all-powerful hills in front of me prevents my getting there."
Ouch.

A very fun hex-grid game of exploration and combat with a nice fantasy theme.  The game is extremely long and complicated but the artwork and pieces are fantastic.  I really feel like I am playing a great RPG-esque fantasy game when I explore the lands of Mage Knight.  

There is a chance I might be getting rid of this because of Star Trek Frontiers which has much better packaging/box locations for items, and i think Star Trek might do the adventure theme better than even fantasy can.

Update: I have reduced this to a rating of 8 because of the sheer complexity of the rules which sometimes comes off as convoluted.  Still very fun, but I seriously fear someone wanting to play this.  It requires a freaking rehearsal to make sure I don't mess up the rules.  If this were any other game I would rate this a 6 because of my strong feelings over the ridiculous complication of this game, but it is that good that it deserves a better rating.

Fantasy, deck building and this game aren't my cup of tea. Shuffle the same boring cards over and over and try to do your best with what you get in your hand. If players aren't familiar with this game, wait forever before it's your turn again. Check the rules to see if you can do that or that with your 5 boring cards. 

Just too long and boring, if you don't appreciate the theme and shuffle shuffle shuffling your deck and hoping for your few cards to be in the right order. Actually building your deck is very difficult. Don't expect to get many new cards during the game.

RATING: 8
I haven't played this one much, but the core concept seems quite solid. There are, however, a few things that bug me. Firstly, the instruction booklet is typically Vlaada in its impenetrability. Secondly, the 4 different Heroes that you can choose from are absolutely not unique in any way. 75% of your skills will actually usually be chosen from the common discard pile (i.e. other Heroes' skills), and only one of your cards in your deck will be unique to you. This cuts down on the game's replay value for me. Lastly, the game's mechanics, although interesting, seem ill-adapted to the genre. As a powerful Hero roaming the countryside, I spend an inordinate amount of effort trying to merely move across the landscape, which is bizarre.

RATING: 8
This is a gamer's game. It has some of the most exhausting game-play of any board game out there. After a game of Mage Knight, I feel like I am in need of nice rest and a cold drink. While this game completely wears me out, I absolutely adore it.

It takes quite a lot of time and table space, but trudging through a game of Mage Knight is one of the most rewarding experiences I have come across in gaming. No other game has given me the sense of progress like Mage Knight has. Watching the decisions you make start to shape your experience and turn your fledgling adventurer into an all-out force of nature is just so satisfying. 

I drop Mage Knights score to an 8 for a few reasons. The first reason is the length of time required to play. This game can take over 3 hours for just a solo game. Adding more players only increases this exponentially. The second reason is the sheer weight of the rules. Nothing about Mage Knight is intuitive. I mean, the game has 2 rule books! Granted, the rule books are split nicely for sort of an intro to the game and the full rules, but it still may require flipping through both books to get through a game. 

Having said all of that, I feel like this game would not be possible without the insane amount of litigation and time required to get through it. I think that is precisely why I enjoy it. It is a crunchy, mind-bending experience that will truly test your endurance.

Very interesting. Just the.intro scenario played, but I like it. And the concept of solo seems to work too. I can see why it's so controversial, but the randomisation of a deck builder in a dungeon crawl has been done with Thunderstone, and that doesn't seem to get the same level of dislike. Maybe MK takes itself a bit more seriously. Eithe way I like it, but I think the AP aspect would put me off playing with more than 2 or 3.

RATING: 7
Not perfect, but very cool. Mage Knight definitely has some warts, including being fiddly in many respects. I also think it has balance issues, especially in scenarios where a player going last can get caught behind others, forced into poor territory, get shut out of cities, etc. Mage Knight also has a quality I typically loathe in games ... the rich get richer and there's no way for a player who falls behind to catch up. OK, all that said, the components are cool, the theme is rich and the game is pretty fun. There's more than enough to like here that I'm willing to overlook the flaws for the most part. Looking forward to getting more familiar with everything to at least minimize the fiddly feel ...

I'm giving this a 10 based on sheer ingenuity.  That being said, most people will not be attracted to this title because it has, by far, the highest learning curve of any board game I've ever seen.  I spent about a week learning this game (not exaggerating).  There is so much to absorb that, along with a 20 page rule book, it comes with another 20 page book that takes you through a game walk through.  You definitely want to do the walk through before attempting a game on your own.  

The beauty of this game, though, is that it's an outstanding single-player game.  This amazing and epic world unravels as you explore all that it has to offer.  There is no set path to follow.  Your options seem almost limitless.  

You come across villages, where you can recruit units to help you in your battles or you can receive healing from battle injuries or you can choose to be a bad guy and plunder the village, helping your immediate needs but hurting your reputation.

Throughout this mystical land, you'll also encounter a variety of rampaging monsters, or dungeon adventures, or ruins, or keeps, or monasteries, or mage towers, or many other sites that offer a variety of choices that help you build fame and treasures and new spells along the way.

Also, the map expands as you explore, each tile offering unique challenges.  Then after you have built up your army and learned all the spells and acquired all the powerful artifacts that you could, you assault the city gates and attempt to be victorious by overthrowing the powerful cities and their powerful defenders.

I've only began to touch on all the cool things this game has to offer.  It is truly an epic adventure, that requires a little luck and great deal of skill and strategy.  There are no dice for determining battles.  It's all about figuring out the best way to play your hand and build your deck and make use of the available crystals, which strengthen your cards.  Play it alone or cooperatively with some friends or competitively with friends.  There are a whole slew of scenarios to satisfy each type of challenge.

If you don't mind (or even enjoy, like I do) taking a lot of time to learn a game, then your investment will be well paid off.  Outstanding adventure game!

Update - 3/25/14 - Downgrading my rating to an 8 due to game length.  Played a 3 player game and only completed half the game in 5 hours.  The other two players did not enjoy it enough to try it again.  Still a very strong single-player title but the multi-player version has not been well received.

RATING: 7
Probably not as bad as I'm rating it.  My issue was the "end of round" mechanic which requires you to forfeit your turn when you end the round, and your opponents each get one more turn.  I was the last player to play, but also the first player through my cards.  So by ending the round my opponents essentially got two extra turns then I did.  The scenario we played was supposed to last 3 turns, but could potentially last only 2.  It only lasted two and triggered by the player before locating a city.  Essentially that meant every player got one last turn, including the player who found the city.  Again being the last player it essentially allowed my opponents one more turn then me yet again.  All in all I think our two rounds only lasted like 4 or 5 turns each, and in this time frame I received 3 less turns then my opponents.  It seemed like a poor mechanic to essentially lose that many turns in comparison to my opponents.  Again, the game is probably better then I'm rating it, but that mechanic soured me on my first play.

This game is a 10 out of 10, ANYDAY!! 

It's a very complex game & you may get discouraged trying to understand everything at first. But, I think if you give it the time, it will be very rewarding.

The different scenarios all play very well, I personally enjoy the conquest ones the best. Your entire game (in the conquest scenario) is comprised of Leveling up your Mage Knight, Learning new spells, learning advanced actions, getting a lot of artifacts & some units that you will use in the city conquests! 

Those 2 cities (playing the Solo Conquest) are difficult & should not be done prematurely! But, you only have 6 rounds to do it, so doing it efficiently & effectively are crucial!

Overall, every game will play differently, whether you are playing alone or with some friends. A typical game will run about 2-4 hours easily, but you are so involved within the game, you wouldn't even believe where the time has gone to!

RATING: 8.5
Vlada is probably the most versatile game designer around. I'd say his games are either "the beer & pretzel type of games with upraised demands","the ameritrash sort of games with micromanagement elements" or they belong to a third category - that category is reserved to the games where you can't really make up your mind which one of the two previous categories the game would fit into best. That's how I feel about Mage Knight, because it's got so much going for it. 

On one side it's got flavor all over the place ( Magic in elusive or in stored form, Artefacts, levying units, sites (dungeons, ruins, keeps, etc.), exploring, miniatures, atmospheric artwork, Pillaging, Plundering, Spells, day and night differentiation...
On the other side there's the optimisation in terms of which mana to get from the source or which cards to play sideways for best effect. Things to go through in your head over and over, slightly altered to figure out what works best. 

There's two things I didn't like so much, which would be:
-there can be quite some downtime
-  you can have pretty bad luck with exploration

And did I hear people complaining about a lack of interaction? Why? I really must me be misled with my parameters for interaction.
Sometimes people sing in praise about the interactive ways a game has. And they won't hesitate to tell you that the superior interaction lies within this: Someone on a turn previous to you drew a card from the table. And this new constellation of cards- being that there's one less to choose from - is what they will call interaction. 
Really, if one can't see the interaction in this game, you wouldn't spot interaction if it was a 500-feet Godzilla. A 500 feet Godzilla that's alread grabbed you and holds you close to his face for you to see.

Adventurous magical warriors wander a newly discovered land, fighting monsters, exploring ruins, influencing factions and recruiting heroes, and conquering enemy cities. The core of the game is using a deck-building mechanic to generate resources like movement, strength, defense, mana, and influence to take actions across the board.

The game is mostly about puzzling out how to use your limited hand of resources to achieve the goals of your turn. Because of this, the thematic elements of the game are a bit abstracted.

As a general rule with board games, my tastes break towards "The more complex, the better". Mage Knight is an excellent demonstration there are exceptions to every rule. It plays like a Legendary style deck builder combined with an adventure sim like Runebound, mixed in with aspects unique to either... and is somehow even more complicated than that sounds while capturing the fun of none of the above. It all feels like a dry equation you fill out on a math test, and they it tells you what a good or bad job you did, and... that's it. Rinse and repeat till your arbitrary goal is met, add up points, that's the game. Victory feels hollow, defeat almost a relief as it means you can stop playing. Compared to a game like Hero Realms or Xenoshyft, there's just no context... this may have a plethora of added mechanics, but they do anything but make it interesting.

RATING: 7
Still figuring out a rating for this one.  The more I play this, the worse I seem to get -- it's not a forgiving game even though I found the allegedly complex rules rather easy to figure out.  It does generate some pretty cool narratives and a real sense of accomplishment when things go well, which are key for me in a game I'll be playing mostly (exclusively?) solitaire, but it also feels a little bit like it's wound too tight.  I feel like a few minor mistakes early on can cripple the rest of the game.  Dunno!

Fantastic, thematic fantasy game by Vlaada Chvátil!
Very rules heavy! Take hours to play - some of the scenarios take me the most of a day, as I like to take the time to think though my moves. It is the best solo-game in my collection and also works great with two players. I would expect that games with more than two players only works if all players are VERY experienced with the game - otherwise the downtime between your turns would be too long. 

Gameplay has a distinct puzzle-feel with deckbuilding as one of a number of game mechanisms. I especially love the cyclic change between day and night rounds with each their distinct flavor. 

It is the only game I have where the rulebook include rules for how to roll your move back, when you find a flaw in your calculations - tells something about the gameplay complexity!

A gamer's game! Really enjoy this one, plays out well with two player's (co-op) and is a nice evening game. The puzzle aspect of dealing with your hand is elegantly done and it seems pretty balanced overall. Wish there were a few more co-operative scenarios.

My BGG top 20 game that I just don't get why it's so highly rated. It has so many issues (length, mechanics, lack of interaction, downtime, complexity vs subject matter etc) that stack up to make it a painful exercise in maths homework that should but doesn't feel fun.

RATING: 9
A phenomenal game.  This game fits perfectly into the dungeon-crawler genre for me.  I usually don't have the patience for the playtime or mechanical lightness of something like Descent, or a tabletop RPG, and I don't really miss the loss of an explicit narrative.

One thing that Mage Knight does better than any other game is impart a sense of character progression.  The additions to your deck, skills and stats happen very incrementally, and so almost without realizing it you become much much more powerful.  Enemies that would have been too powerful to take on alone at the start of the game are suddenly manageable in groups of 3-4 (with a little clever planning).

The game suffers a bit from analysis paralysis, which somehow manages to be both mitigated and exacerbated by the rulebook's explicit allowance of winding back a turn and replaying it provided no hidden information has been revealed.  On balance, however, this rule makes the game a LOT more playable and overall lowers the level of AP.  As with many games like this, having one player substantially slower than the others has a compounding effect, because the other players will complete their turns that much more quickly (having had the slow player's turn to do their planning as well).  I don't recommend playing with more than one new player at a time, if possible.

Includes Lost Legion, Shades of Tezla, and Krang expansions.

Mage Knight was opened, some of the celaphane was opened to look at some cards but this has never even hit our table.  And it doesn't seem likes its going to.  No clue what I'd want in exchange for it currently but that doesn't mean you shouldn't send offers if interested.  (just don't be upset if I don't take it)

Waited months, decided not to purchase, then changed my mind. Interesting game for sure. Glad I got it to give it a fair try, but it's not going to see a lot of play in the future. It's been traded away to Alan in Montreal and has a better home with him now.
Balancing set up time versus sheer overall enjoyment I'll take Thunderstone over this 90% of the time.
I am considering Star Trek: Frontiers as a replacement but we shall see.

Good about the game: It's not the kind of game where you feel you've ever "seen it all." Challenges always feel fresh because things come at you in different combos. 
Not good about the game: The further along in the quest your character makes it the more complex battle becomes. It gets very math-y.

RATING: 7.5
2/4/2012 - I need a few more plays under my belt before I give it a proper review, but after one play it has the potential to be a one of my favorites!

::UPDATE::

3/29/12 - I'm conflicted. I know there is a brilliantly-designed game here. I know there is an adventure game that is more than just moving around and getting lucky or unlucky. I know there is a lot of variety. I know there is a great mix of mechanics throughout. Yet I really struggle with the game's pace. Perhaps it's the rules. Perhaps it's the set-up time. Perhaps it's the slow deck play and deck build. I'm not sure. But after my second play, I felt like I had been to a long day at work. I just wanted to go to bed because I was so tired and spent from working through such an incredibly heavy task.

Maybe I'll give it another shot or two in a multi-player situation, and with people who know the rules well. But for now, I'm starting to think it might be the first game by Vlaada that will get traded away. I'll have no problem finding willing traders, btw. It's currently between print runs and in high demand.

::UPDATE::

12/1/12 - I'm putting it up for trade and dropping my rating to a 7.5. After three plays, I've decided the slow pace, multitude of slightly-different rules for every type of terrain feature, and the infrequency with which I play it means it's taking up precious space on my shelf.

I think this is the best game of 2011 hands down. I love Eclipse, but MK is so darn good! It has so many game mechanics from other types of games I thoroughly enjoy. It is a deck builder (without over doing it like Dominion), it is an adventure that keeps you engaged even during other player's turns (like an RPG), it has a great combat system (if you enjoy conflict), and much of the core mechanics feel like a Euro without the blandness. It is just plain awesome!

I was obsessed with the game. It is unique amongst my gaming collection as it plays brilliantly as a multiplayer competitive game as well as a coop game and finally it is next to Enemy Action Ardennes my favourite solo game. It has a unique fantasy theme, amazing board and components, and this incredible card driven game play that makes my brain jump for joy at the mental challenges it is presented with. Love love love this game.

Got this for solo play. It's a wonderful game. Very puzzly and brainy. I have never won, but that's part of the fun. I play it when I have a lot of time and want a heavy game.

Realizing that I don't have the time for a solo game this long anymore and I would never play it with other players. Looking to offload this and replace it with Gloomhaven.

RATING: 8.5
Whenever there was a discussion of great solo games, Mage Knight showed up. Usually with comments about how hard and brainy it was and how it was much more an optimization puzzle than a dungeon quest. Which appeals to me, actually, and so I got it. So far only one first play of the exploratory mission, but it already felt great!

RATING: 9
Just one play so far, the basic intro scenario.  I like it.  Lots of interesting choices and strategy each round.  And I can see the various ways a game could go "wrong" for you.  Only had a couple of turns where I thought "I just can't do much here," but by then I was just trying to wrap the game up bc I was running out of time.  Otherwise I could have explored the board more.  I know this will hit the table more often, especially for solo plays and when I'm with my 12 year old.  My rating may go up or down more after we sink further into it.

**Update: there really aren't more games that I think about when not playing more than this one.  There is still so much for me to explore here after a couple of plays, but man do I enjoy this world.  Vlaada really put a good thing together here.

The system is really unique and provides and excellent and fresh puzzle every time.  No two games will ever play the same.  It's an excellent play solo.

The game does feel like it ends kind of abruptly and with a sense of relief rather than accomplishment, but that doesn't change the fact that it is the best solo experience I've encountered.

It is hard to tolerate the play time with 3 and almost impossible with 4.

The rules are hard to get familiar with and you will have to look up random edge cases forever.

Despite all that it might be the best gaming experience around.

I only gave this 9/10 because of the complexity.  You really need to have BOTH the walkthrough and the rulebook handy.  The walkthrough does an okay job at getting you through a game.  I'd highly suggest watching the top play through videos before attempting this.  It does take up quite a bit of space (will not fit on a card table), so be prepared.  The artwork and pieces are exquisite and the game play is very challenging, yet fun.  I've only played solo and would never play with a newbie- there's just way too much to explain.  I very much enjoy playing this game!!!

You have to admire all the elements that make such a balanced and engaging world-system. The 1st half of each game is a blast. Just too number-crunchy in the endgame for me.

RATING: 9
Mechanically, very solid and very fun.  However, I have yet to actually play the game competitively, and I'm not sure I'd want to.  The downtime for anything more than 2 players would be prohibitive, and for a two-player duel I'm fairly certain there are better games.  As a solo or coop exercise, it is very good, but not sure how much longevity that will have (since single-agent games, by their very nature, are so much more solvable).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An very enjoyable experience, and that means a lot considering I dislike fantasy settings. 

Interesting hand management element makes combat luckless, the components are amazing and the game really immerses. Background story also adds to the theme. The game works extremelly well mechanics wise, and manages to combine the best of the two worlds - strategy and theme. There is great depth here, extremelly tough decisions, an amazing progress arc with rpg elements, amazing variability and replayability... the game shines in almost every aspect a gamer would like it to.

So, any cons? Your campaign progress is still luck dependant due to the luck of the draw and exploration. The character progression is over just as it pays up, which half the time feels a little too short. It's a multihour experience, but that is really a design choice. Yet the major flaw is this game almost is multiplayer solitaire, no matter what mode you play in. In competitive mode the only thing you need to do is pay attention for the bonus scoring at the end of the game (which is not enough to make that much of a difference), and in cooperative mode you don't really plan anything as a team.

All in all, I'd like to play again, despite the fantasy theme and the lacking interaction -  it's that deep and immersive.

What I like:

-Very interesting and original mix of mechanics that just somehow blend together seamlessly. Deck-building, exploration, dice, different card mechanics to name a few. It works really well. 
-Great brain teaser! You really get to exercise the grey matter with this one.
-The board and miniatures look really cool as you explore throughout the ever-changing landscape. 
-Absolutely the best solitaire experience in any board game bar none. I have yet to hear from someone who plays games alone who does not have this as their favorite. 
-Cool and well-done fantasy theme. 
Amazing replay value with all the things that change every game, the different scenarios and different characters that are very unique from each other.  

What I do not like:

-The rules to this are ridiculous! I have always insisted on playing by the rules and so I have spent 20-30 hours reading the 3 different manuals (with the expansion one) and the FAQ's and forum disscussions. Yes, it's that complex if you want to do it correctly.
-Game length. This games takes forever and may the lord have mercy upon your soul if you accidently get into a 4 player adventure. This is going to take alll day regardless of scenario. Actually i have only ever played it 3 players one time, and this was the absolute limit for me. After having played this game over 50 times I was able to complete the full solo experience in "Just" 3 hours. 
-The card quality could be a little better (then again, most folks are probably not gonna play 50-100 games of this like me ;) )

In summary: My absolut favorite solitaire game, works great with 2 also. Very long and complex but it's so worth once you have invested the time into learning it.

I really want to play this beautiful game almost every night, but the set-up time is holding me back. I am trying to find a way to set it up faster. I sometimes just set it up and realise I wont be able to finish it, so I put it away again. But even that is satifying. Nerd.

RATING: 9
This one was tough to get my head around.  I read the rules, read them again, watched youtube videos of people teaching how to play, then played the walkthrough scenario a few times, referred to the rules a few times.

Anyway! this game is really interesting, when I was looking around i read a review that likened this to sort of a Gandalf simulator.  I think that statement is pretty much bang on the money.

You step through a portal (start of the game) and proceed to interact with locals (to recruit armies), learn new spells, gain new artefacts, learn new advanced techniques, move about the land, kill monsters and all through your hand of cards.

It comes across as a clever game, a really clever one.  This is a game i'm definitely keeping, it's got a lot of replay value, it's deep, I can play it solo (all my games have been solo so far, I don't think my mates will get past the rules).  That's probably the only downside, the rules made it tough for me to just pick it up and start playing but once i got through them and played the walkthrough enough to get them to stick in my head, it becomes pretty awesome.  

I was unsure for a while but i'm really glad I stuck with it.  Looking forward to expansions.

This game is incredible! So epic in scale and the feeling of progression is addictive! The game tells a great story which you control in a very large way, you don't exist merely as a pawn in a game of fate, but as the master of your own destiny. Every decision you make matters and will change the course of the game. The rules are dense, but every design decision has purpose and adds to the overall feel of the game. It feels like Heroes of Might and Magic III with a dash of Diablo, and if you top this off with a setting that holds nostalgia for me (Mage Knight miniatures..) you get something truly amazing. Can't wait to play more!

RATING: 8
This game for me is the definition of "Brain Burner". There are more moving parts than... a watch... or something. The game uses a card drafting and deck building mechanic to drive the adventuring, which is really neat, and works very well. There are so many different working parts, that it is difficult to keep track sometimes. The game has a great "level-up" mechanic that makes you feel much more powerful as you adventure onward. Oh, and the hirelings! There are just too many cool things to mention here. Overall, I really like it. As a co-op or even competitive game, it may be a little too "multiplayer solitaire". Still a wonderful game, and I imagine that the solo game is extremely satisfying.

RATING: 9
The reason why it isn't a 10 is because you need a huge table and an ocean of time.

This game is absolutely amazing though. If you like boardgames, co-op/versus or solitaire, you should get this. It plays on an epic scale, with which I mean you walk across a distant land with your figurine. You battle monsters, grow stronger, visit villages, convince/hire peasants/mercenaries/knights/healers/druids to join you in your quest (which usually ends up taking down a big castle filled to the brim with resistance), you fight dragons, visit cloisters, visit mage towers.

This game has so much going for it, it's amazing. But as I wrote before, you need a huge table and an ocean of time to play a mission from start to finish. If you don't mind leaving the game on the table you can play your mission over several sessions ofcourse.

It doesn't take a 10/10 because it can't be finished in one evening at high player's count, and also because a small error in the first day can make, imho, your path to glory really really difficult.

This game can be more fun with less players, or so I was told, but the truth is that I played it with other 3, and the game with four players has a HUGE downtime. Oh, dear God, in some turns I did nothing besides walk or rest, and that was all that I did in about 30 minutes.

This isn't what I call and adventure. There are monsters, and keeps, and mage towers and whatnot, and nothing of this gave me the feel of real theme - probably because I was too much absorbed trying to make the best use of the cards in hand, thinking only about "blue mana, move 4, 3 damage, gain red crystal, then attack 5 plus attack 2" and so forth.

The game do have mechanics that work, all nicely knitted together. I didn't notice imbalance nor any rough edges. But, even so, I just wanted it to end. Too much time for too little enjoyment.

For two players, or solo, it maybe a great game, but I won't be fiding out.

I need to re work my top 10 as this should be up there with Twilight Struggle. This is easily one of my favourite games. Always surprises me how well this plays solo, like a video game in cardboard. For that reason it has to be joint first with TS. Also like this with more players, only ever played with 3. Wouldn't play with more as the final turns can be quite lengthy as you work out the best way to assault the city garrisons. Would like to try this with 2 as this could be its sweet spot. This is the only fantasy game I know of with strategy and tactics, and one that I am still improving at. Each game offers so many choices and decisions. The 6 characters that are playable all require mastery not unlike street fighter characters. To think I initially dismissed this game based on screenshots, glad I looked into it further. There is so much depth to this game, truly a classic.

If you are into the fantasy setting and do not mind all the fiddliness then I can see the attraction of this game. I am not fond of fantasy but I do not mind fiddliness so I'll play it but probably not suggest it very often. A bit too long for me with this kind of theme but some fun and challenges to enjoy as well

Best adventure and hand management game ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quite simply one of the best fantasy games around offering a wealth of flexibility: solo, co-op, competitive and PvP all catered for. This is not a game like Dungeons and Dragons because of the competitive element in each scenario - whilst you can play friendly there is a final scoring system, which brings in a strategy element.

The rules are well written and examples helpful but it will likely take you a few plays to get your head around it all and ensure you're playing correctly; I would highly recommend watching a (solo) game on Youtube for clarity. The map and different scenarios allow a lot of variety meaning it is never the same game twice and there are optional rules that you can adopt to change the playstyle/difficulty.

I believe many reviewers have talked about significant downtime. The game is a major time investment requiring a great deal of set-up and (frequent) consultation of the rules; presently our group is at 45-60 minutes per round, of which there are usually 3-6 of in one game, however, I believe we are beginning to speed up as we become more familiar with the game and the rules of each scenario. Turns are not always straight forward and you really have to think how best to use your actions, which frequently involves reviewing the end result; our group has, so far, found the task of problem solving other players' turns rather fun. I think the designers have done what they can to reduce downtime but it does require someone to keep the game rolling.

Although the game is an investment of both finance and time, we have found it to be an addictive game of superior quality. Looking forward to the expansions.

Rating based on multiple solo plays and two three player plays.  I absolutely love the tension and theme.  Really can't get enough of this game and I find myself thinking about the solo game too much since I leave it set up in the basement and play it out as time allows.  Fantastic game, can't wait for the expansion.

This is a deck builder with role selection and exploration....upgrades, companions, etc

Awesome - I am a fan of deck building...if I knew that was involved I would have picked up a copy long ago-

Played with 3 and that is probably the correct number

(and did I mention I burned the monastery down and took their prized artifact?) 

cool cool

RATING: 8
A big game, in many senses. Lots of physical components taking up a big table's worth of space and it takes a long time (for new players at least), but it also has a nicely large scope. A good sense of building from the nearly claustrophobic start to a wide open map. I want to play with PvP next time, since sometimes the "good spots" are taken by other players. I like how players can control how fast they want to go through the rounds, although you don't want to be much slower than the fastest player. Each turn is full of interesting decisions, since each hand can be used in so many ways. The game isn't without problems. Besides sometimes-significant downtime, there are almost too many rules, in that it's so easy to miss something in the sea of words and pictures. Not an easy game to learn, but once you're in, it flows nicely. Sort of like a fantasy combat Through the Ages.

Amazing. Vlaada Chvatil is the best designer at making game whose mechanics are so diverse and intertwined with the theme that you don't "play a board game" anymore, "you live an experience"! Here that of a hero in a rpg world. Fan of rpg videogames, that one really hits the spot.

I had a wonderful time learning this over a multi-day snowstorm. But this sort of thing is not my bag in the end, tho this does what it does as well as you could ever want I think. Tight mechanics & creative application of deck building without overwhelming the game. Combo building matched to map presence & opportunities is tight and varied.

It just became complexity for complexity sake, a puzzle to solve each turn, & likely stifled by AP & take-backs. But damn is the deck management & powering up well done, and I have a soft spot for maps combined with cards in this way, it grounds the game abstractions pleasurably.

I have played this a couple of times solo just to get to know the game but didn't finish one.  I finally finished my first solo conquest game and I loved it.  I can't wait to play it again, and others in the household want to learn it.  I will come back again and adjust the review, but for right now it is very high on my list.  After a couple more plays, it is just getting better.  I finally beat the solo quest just barely and ended with a 106 score.  It was quite fun and learned a few mistakes I can try to fix.  However, much like this game.  UPDATED, I have played this game quite a bit and it does not lose it's luster.  I really enjoy this game as these best solo gaming experience.  It is fantastic.  I usually like dice games and at first I thought it would turn me off because there really is NO dice rolling except the mana dice, which is really nothing, but it doesn't.  The balance and card play is what makes the whole game and it is great to try to figure things out.

RATING: 8
This is a hard game to rate. 

It's not an adventure game, yet there is adventuring. 
Its not a deck building game, yet I get a deck I can (semi) customize. 

Rather it's really a hand management puzzle solving game. 

Incredibly frustrating, as you spend most of the time trying to solve the least worst turn you can have given the cards you were dealt. 

However you can tell the game is very well designed. Virtually no rules ambiguities despite the complexity of the game, and a lot of the mechanics (especially wounds) are very well done. 

Going with an 8 after 1 learning game and 2 actual games. Can see it going up or down depending on future plays.

RATING: 9
It took some time before I decided to tackle this foreboding game. Based on solo plays and finally becoming comfortable enough to say this is a game that is well worth the investment in terms if price and time spent learning. the video tutorials are a must. It's easy to become engrossed and realize you have spent the whole evening trying to solve the quest.

RATING: 8
Game is better than a "6", but I rate on the scale in the "?" that pops up and that's based on desire to play.  Game is a lot of fun, but very long!  It just might be the type of game that is too long.  While I like playing TI3 for 10-12 a few times a year, I'm not sure this game does the same.  Having only played once, the non-interaction between players (besides racing to do things) is a turn-off for me.  Will hope to get more plays to make a better informed rating.  ***Updated rating to an 8 since I would never turn down a playing because that means we all understand how much time it's going to take.  This is about a 2 hour per player game with an extra half a hour if they are new!

The core game has some good aspects, but there is far too much pointless detail - quick, what's the difference between a dungeon and a tomb, and how often is it going to affect the game significantly? And the movement costs are ridiculously high - in our game after the first few turns we might as well have been at different tables, as it would take 2-3 turns for any of us to get to anything another player discovered.

What is it with this game that people like so much? Is there a solitare epidemic somewhere that I am not aware of? I mean, it is essentially a solitere game, isn't it? Granted the concept it self is fine and in theory I should like it, being a fantasy nerd and all. It has a lot of tactics and it looks nice... But the gameplay just becomes a long and tedious affair. It might work as a PC game where you dont have to fiddle with the components and look up tabels etc. But as a boardgame it is "work".

RATING: 8
Excellent.  Challenging and somewhat complex.  Good theme.  Long set-up, tear-down, and play time prevents me from playing this more often.  I sometimes feel that the luck of the board and card configurations greatly effects my success, but I suppose that makes every play unique.

I've currently only played this solo.  Solo plays well, but the dummy player of the base game feels artificial.  Someday, I'd like to pick up the Lost Legion expansion that is supposed to address this.

RATING: 7
Thematically well done but for my taste it could be a bit more streamlined. Multiplayer feels mostly like multiplayer solitare. Fun is a bit limited when half of the time all you do is watching the other player watching his cards calculating. Great solitaire game however (rather an 8 or 9), good with two but I would never ever play it with more than 2 players.

July 2016: Sold on Geek Market. Just wasn't getting to the table. Too many fiddly rules that we had a tough time remembering between games, and so many other games we'd prefer to play. Deserved a new forever home.

The intimidating ruleset was a barrier getting this to the table, and is making it hard to get it back to the table as well.

Initial rating. 

This game has lots of stuff going on. Some of it is very cool! I really like how the leveling up works by building up your deck and learning new skills. The game has good progression all the way - characters and enemies get better etc.

I am partial for the puzzle type combat. It reminds a lot of what Dungeon Lords has (although there you can do it simultaneously, I think). This creates a lot of downtime and I don't think it feels too exciting or rewarding to slash the enemies as it could be. I think also that the combat is perhaps just a bit too complicated for my tastes. Learning all the special skills and powers is huge commitment and it is easy to play something wrong.

I'm not sure if I really like the how the round structure works (day and night cycles + playing until the deck is exhausted + and after one player announces the turn end). 

The game has nice theme, but it feels mostly like a solo-puzzle type game. Not that there is anything wrong with this type of games. Just don't expect too much direct interaction in the game.

6/24/2012 - This is my first play through of the game. It took us about 2 hours and some change to read through the rules and set up the game. By the time we actually made it to gameplay, most of us were pretty exhausted from learning the rules. Once we finally got a hang for how to play the game, it started getting interesting.  I can see this game has a lot of potential to be awesome. Look forward to my next play through.

RATING: 8
Update: Played quite a few full solo scenarios and I'll stick with my 8 for now. It's definitely a well-designed game with a lot of depth, but between the game length, setup time, table space, and demands on opponents, it's not going to be something I could play all the time. But I could easily see how certain players/groups could play the heck out of this thing and rate it higher.

I just purchased Mage Knight a couple days ago and have only played the walkthrough scenario once, but this is certainly going to be at least an 8 for me long term. It will completely replace several other adventure games that I keep around for occasional solo play.

It's clear that this game aspires to the "serious adventure game" niche once held solely by Magic Realm (amongst major games, at least), though just calling it a "modern version of MR" would be too loose to do justice to either game.

Despite many comments I've heard, the rules (in my copy purchased October 2012) seem quite clear and thoughtfully presented to me. There are a lot of them, for sure, but they seem both precise and thematically appropriate, which makes them easier to remember. Perhaps I'll feel differently after digging into the full scenarios, but I suspect otherwise. I feel good about these rules, whereas I'm generally very critical. Perhaps the designer is just a good match for my style of thinking.

I'll certainly update these brief comments in the future.

Amazing solo experience. Deeply thematic, strategic and tactical, I keep losing hours on this one as it just sucks you in.

I simply don't understand how this game is on BGG's top ten. It's the worst of both worlds - like the worst Euros, it's a dull and un-interactive optimization puzzle ; like the worst thematic games, it's fiddly, full of arbitrary little rules, has busy visuals, and is overly reliant on chance. Furthermore, that chance seems to be in all the wrong places. You can answer the question "what will the outcome of my hero's battle with these orcs be?" with absolute certainty, but the question "will my hero be able to pick up his lazy feet and walk to the nearest village next turn?" is anyone's guess. This is the dreaded "roll to move" in card form - why don't people see this? Combat is sucked free of drama, while merely moving around is a frustrating endeavor. It is extremely easy to get screwed by poor draws, and there is no way to mitigate this possibility.

The deckbuilding element is minimal, a shoddy cash-in on the mechanic du jour. You get one measly advanced action card every other level. Want to get a spell card? Well, you'll have to find a mage tower, walk to it (provided you have enough movement cards), try to defeat the defenders (oops, you didn't have enough movement cards last turn, so you played your attack cards sideways for one movement point each), then spend 7 influence points to get a spell card (which means you have to spend two cards at the very least, provided you drew influence cards this turn.) Walking to the tower probably took one turn, defeating the defenders took another, and gaining the spell took yet another turn. Meanwhile you're eating through your deck at an alarming pace trying to accomplish all these things, so that by the time you've gained your lonesome spell card, the better part of a round (you get six in most scenarios) is gone. 

John Sizemore's review pretty much sums up my problems with the game. "An adventure game with no surprises."

Mayday Sleeve Size: Card Game 63.5 x 88 mm - they are a little loose fitting... this may be good for the Shades of Tezla Expansion, or so I've heard. Nope, no difference - You guyz... sheeze. Setup time won't be an issue; it's occupying my gaming room table for the foreseeable future. Back to washing down the kitchen table every day ('got' a game of [gameid=803] to fit in), or maybe [gameid=70512] or even [gameid=127398]. Any non deck builder will do.

Once you've mastered both rulebooks and can hold the particulars in your head, it doesn't seem like a complex game at all. [i]It's not much more than an advanced Heroscape, (minus the cool minis) with a bit of card drafting and round counters, really[/i].. Too fiddly and long to rate a '10'  and solo is not my thing (I get along great with my wife). 2 player solitaire, fantasy warfare, bliss! .. once the difficulty level is adjusted. All in all, not perfect, but an easily modified and well deserved '8'.

Now with Mage Knight "Item Shop", and Mage Knight "Quests" (both http://www.printerstudio.com versions). Both a pretty good effort, (typos and foggy rules aside). FYI: the cost for both totaled $39.96, shipping included (sleeves, another $7.40). You're welcome. PS: I would get bored with the game, rather quickly, (not counting the other expansions) without these variants.. so, thanks to you both.

Game with fanspansions: '8.5'

Onward, pimping fools!

Mage knight. It's incredible.
I've never played a game that so effectively combined strategy and theme. When it's my turn I have to plan out every move; very little is left to chance. Thematically I feel completely engaged as a hero raging through the lands acquiring fame and fortune.

The rules are a bit too much, with a lot of rules that don't matter and the rules being divided between 2 different books makes things a bit confusing but the game is so solid it survives both of these flaws.

When I first purchased this game I would have given it 2 stars easily.  Partially my fault as I was still pretty new to the board game hobby and jumped into the deep end almost immediately.  I didn't play the game for quite a while after my first play-through but I kept it around because I still wanted to understand why so many people loved this game.  So I decided one day to sit down and really work on learning and playing the game.  I discovered a game with so many different elements that come together to create a unique and challenging puzzle every turn.  It's been a lot of fun so far and I recently purchased the lost legion expansion and will be trying that out once it arrives.

So overall I definitely recommend this game with the caveat that you should only play this once you have become more accustomed to board games.  One other thing I highly recommend doing is purchasing a custom insert for the game to help alleviate set up time.  The long set up was a major detraction for me and while it still takes some time to set up, the custom insert certainly helps.

Very good game based on intro scenario. Got me worked up despite my suspicions that the lack of randomness when going to battle might be a bummer. Can hardly wait for a game with the full rules!

A few full solo games done. It is rewarding but also exhausting, 4-5 hours and a loooot of rules referencing on all the nuances that emerge. This is by no means a bad game but high rules knowledge is required to play it smoothly and I doubt I want to play a full scenario with anyone the least bit prone to AP. I even got pissed off at myself for AP:ing during my solo games... However, rating 8 stands.

Foreword: I have logged about 10-15 games so far, without any competitive play.
Mage Knight is not a game for people with short attention span. It may also appear somewhat random if you don't understand the game mechanics very well. Also please don't except a deckbuilder at the game's core. 
If you however make it past the long and somewhat tedious rulebook (which redeems its tediousness by having very precise and well defined rules for later reference) and a few misconceptions regarding possible expectations for an epic fantasy exploration game, Mage Knight unfolds an unrivaled epic marathon of turn-by-turn optimization and puzzle solving. The feeling of accomplishment after a successful city assault, knowing how much thought and hard work was required to do so, simply can not be beaten by any other co-op game for me.

It works, and it has great components and artwork, but is it worth the time and complexity?  No, not even close.  The intense amount of rules overhead and teaching time even in introductory scenarios makes the game bog down. What should be a reasonably light fantasy romp clocks in at 3+ hours. The Mage Knight theme means nothing to me, so it becomes yet another fantasy questing game, something of which there are plenty on the market.  If 'heavy, lengthy, fantasy adventure deck building game' sounds appealing, you should try it. Otherwise you can definitely skip it.

One of the few games that may actually deserve a 10. Epic on so many levels. Great RPG feel, a deck building component that is fun, and interesting mana system for powering up cards. The ONLY downside is potential downtime with multiple players.

Convoluted "exploration and combat" fantasy game with a lot of options and bits.

Gioco bellissimo. Avvincente evocativo, solo per veri appassionati non per giocatori da una partita e basta.

Conquista totale in solitario molto difficile e impegnativo.
Conquista totale coop in 2 giocatori è un classico.
Liberare le miniere molto divertente e veloce anche in 3.
I signori dei sotterranei, dungeon lords, molto divertente uno scneraio adrenalinico pieno di magie e artefatti. consigliato in 2.

Devo ancora provare conquista e mantieni a squadre in 4.

Il tutoria per imparare i gioco dura 7 ore se si vuole studiare giocando, ma affronta molti aspetti del gioco.

Per reclutare nuovi amici consiglio di farli giocare alo scenario liberare le miniere e non il tutorial come suggerito dal manuale.
se gli amici sono soddisfatti poi si può fare la conquista totale coop con le città.

Mage Knight was not an instant winner with me. It took me 5-6 plays to really come to appreciate how everything makes thematic sense in this euro-style quest game.

Played this 3 player and it was a horrific experience. Way too long with too much downtime, fairly random in certain parts combined with snowballing power levels, fiddly and over complicated rules, pretty much unteachable to new players.

This should be considered a solo only game, I could see it being good then because the card play is nice and solo eliminates downtime.

I did not enjoy this game. However, there are a couple caveats:

1) I bought this game specifically for solo play. I have not played it multiplayer.

2) After trying other solo play games and not enjoying them too much, I thought I'd try Make Knight because it's the consensus #1 solo game out there. After not enjoying Mage Knight, I'm sure it's partially because I don't personally enjoy solo gaming. I will play a game solitaire on occasion, but I much prefer Lord of the Rings LCG, or even games not designed for solo play but which have theme and mechanics that I really enjoy. 

I like the fantasy theme, but I am really not a fan of the mechanics in this game.

I would never play this game multiplayer. It's just too complex and....how do it put this....not fun.

So if you like solo gaming, I do think this game is worth a try. For me personally though, I just don't find a solitaire solve-the-puzzle type experience very fun. 

I don't plan to ever play this game again.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION, EXTENDING INTO THE HEREAFTER. OUR FAVOURITE GAME OF ALL TIME. EVER AND FOREVER.

Simply perfect. Play cooperatively or competitively. Play a short game or a longer one. Play alone. With two players or more.

Thematically strong. You can almost feel yourself exploring a strange land looking for cities to attack. The fantasy setting is a bit generic, but that's not a problem.

Huge numbers of tactical options for spells to buy, fighting units to recruit, and ways to play. You can choose to attack monasteries and be a bad guy (who finds it harder to buy stuff at settlements). Or fight orcs and attract the admiration of villagers (making stuff cheaper to purchase in towns).

Whether or not you like fantasy, it's an amazing game. A must buy. I can't see anyone becoming bored with this ever. It's incredible.

Despite my aversion to fantasy adventure games, Mage Knight is so well designed that I can't help but admire it. After being taught the game and playing a few times at the WBC, I was intrigued and thought I'd be teaching it to my friends back home. Yet when I tried to tackle the rule book I just got overwhelmed and never came back. I would gladly play if someone else were around to teach it, but in the end it just didn't excite me enough to muster the herculean effort required to be the guy who teaches it. It's too non-interactive for me to really love it, I feel.

I own Mage Knight, and have played it mostly solo, and once with two player co-operative with the Lost Legion Expansion.  I rated the game a six because I find the game length to be too long, the rules to be too fiddly and confused, and the combat to be unsatisfying.  But, these are simply the drawbacks to an otherwise very impressive game.  I have chosen to focus on the negative because this game is not for me.  My main criticism is with the combat.  For me, there is no sense of accomplishment upon having defeated a bad guy.  

This game does retain it's value well.  I purchased it for $50 on Amazon with free shipping, and was able to re-sell it at a board game convention for $40 after a few months and a good number of solo play troughs.  I certainly got my monies worth and I think you will too.  But, just not the game for me.

Wonderfully thematic fantasy adventure game. There are many complex decisions to be made, but the gameplay in itself is not that complicated. The mechanics are strong and the game flows beautifully along as you explore, fight and conquer. It manages to be an adventure game while also being a puzzler. You can play Mage Knight with several players, but for me it's a game I prefer to play solitaire. I really like the components. Beautiful pre-painted miniatures, custom dice, solid map tiles, nice little crystals and of course the HeroClix city minis. The cards needed sleeving, but this is not a problem at all as I would have sleeved regardless of card quality.

An intricate amalgamation of game mechanics and rules, meticulously combined into a glorious puzzle. Solving it gives intense satisfaction, unlike any other game I ever played.

If it wasn't for this, and the extremely steep learning curve (Im still struggling with some of the rules), I would play it all the time.

RATING: 8
Vladda has released another masterpiece. I have no idea how he continues to put out game after game that completely breaks the mold of traditional designs, but he continues to innovate in every game genre he tackles. Here he has created a fantasy adventure game in the vein of Runebound or Talisman but with a deck building mechanism that turns the usual character growth system on its ear. The game is also ridiculously complicated, yet the rules are so intuitive that it really isn't hard to keep them straight. Even the little exceptions that spring up from time to time are so logically presented that it is fairly easy to remember them without even opening up the rulebook.

My only real criticism is that I could do without the Mage Knight license. The game was clearly NOT designed around the old miniatures game, as the story presented in the game's introduction has almost nothing to do with what has come before in Mage Knight fiction. The day and night mechanics as well as the concept of mana to drive spell casting are also completely alien to the Mage Knight setting. It smells like a retro-fit and I'm still not completely sold on that aspect of it. Tying the game to that license seems a little counter-intuitive, especially when the game does such a nice job of separating itself from every other fantasy game on the market. Hopefully the Mage Knight tie-in doesn't limit it's appeal to fans of heavier games, because this one has what it takes to be an all-time great.

Not fair to rate this, since I had to stop partway through the session, but it was heading for about a 4.

This reminded me a lot of a jRPG video game: there were tons of little fiddly things to keep track of that weren't really all that interesting, and the gameplay just isn't compelling enough to fill out the long playtime unless you're engaged with your character. Perhaps a better analogy is Arkham Horror, though I think the game bits are a little better here and that the theme is a little less well integrated.

I don't mind complicated games if they add something to it, and if exactly one person who already knew the rules was willing to teach me, I might play this again, but overall I was totally underwhelmed. I can see why people like it, but I don't think it's the game for me.

RATING: 10
Upgraded to a 10. This is just a phenomenal game. There are little nits to pick, the theme is off-putting at times, and the rules overhead can be daunting if you don't play it regularly, but this kicks all kinds of ass. It's just amazing to me how much emerges from what is at heart a reasonably simple core engine.

Amazing solo game. Only played a few times competitively (but no PvP; again, rules overload), but enjoyed that very much as well. Lots of meaningful variability, and as usual with Chvatil games, angst-filled choices.

To like this game you need to like 1) the fantasy theme, 2) the fact that it's a deck building driven game and not just a roll and move game, 3) a steep but scaled learning curve.  It's reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic but it's not that game rather standing on its own merits.

Mage Knight is a beast. Although I haven't grasped all the tiny little rule details yet, after a few plays I can definitely tell that this is a brilliant, one of a kind game. High learning curve though - you have to play it all the time in order to feel comfortable with the rules.

The downside is the length of the game and the fact that it gets a bit too repetitive. After 3 or 4 hours of non-stop moving from point A to point B and killing monsters I tend to lose interest in what's going on. And I can't imagine playing this game with 3 or 4 players - the downtime would be unbearable. 

Also, it's not that uncommon that you get a hand of cards without any movement points - if this happens, all you do in your turn is struggle with moving even to an adjacent space. Instead of focusing on cool stuff, you just keep solving the movement puzzle. And don't get me wrong - it can be fun, but only in small doses... Doing that over and over again can be rather dull.

Mage Knight has some amazing mechanisms and I really understand the love it gets, but since some things about this design really bother me I can't give it my top rating...

Wow.  I finally got around to watching some play thru videos of this game to learn it.  Its amazing.  Great 2 player and one of the best single player games ever.  Every turn is just agonizing to make the best use of your cards.  Truly a masterpiece - it lives up to its hype and more.

Most complicated game so far (spent on reading guide and rules the most time among all knowed games). Still many things to re-read. But of course it doesn't mean the game can't be enjoyable. I got it mainly as a solo game, but some day why not to become as a cooperative for 3-4 players and even a competition.

Really enjoyed first play/introductory scenario.  Lots more to try out here before a final rating.

Now that I've played it a few times, I will say that it is an outstanding game, but the audience for it is very small.  

It really deserves to be played by the same group of people over and over so that they don't have to "figure it out" every single time.

RATING: 9
Got my first play in recently.  I can tell this is going to be a game I will really get in to.  It has adventure, exploration, and tension.  You level up, increase your skills and grow as a hero.  It is very rules-heavy, but the walk through is great and there are a few excellent tutorial videos online.  

Update as of 2/16/15:  I love this game.  at this point, I have exactly 17 plays and I dig this game so much.  Some times, I think, "ug, do I want to go through the hassle of setting this game up to play it?" and the answer is always "absolutely!"  This game is well worth the time and effort.  Its like one big optimization puzzle, and with some imagination it can be a very immersive game.  I know it is not for everyone, but any solo gamer, D&D player, or adventure seeker should at least check it out. 

Update as of 3/12/17: Wow.  I just played my first game of the Volkare's Return scenario for my 40th play.  I got slaughtered.  It was not even close.  He sacked the unconquered city half way through the second day.  This will be a steeper learning curve than the base game!

Update as of 12/24/17: 49th play. 3rd Lost Legion play. 1st win. Of course, it was on the easiest of the easiest setting...but still!

RATING: 7
An excellent game.  Often described as a "gamer's game", each turn throws up a mind-bending puzzle to solve with the cards in hand.  Very clever and thematic but--and this is why it doesn't score higher--it's exhausting!  In a good way, but certainly not a game for everyone, or every night.  It can also runs long; my only go at the full conquest scenario (2-player) ran five hours.

October 5, 2012: I haven't played this a lot, but I know enough now to know that I don't enjoy the experience enough to keep it. The game feels too long for what it is and too mathy to enjoy.

January 7, 2015: I repurchased this a few months back and played it a few more times and I'm enjoying the experience now. I've added this to my 10x10 challenge for the year, so I hope to learn more about it over those plays. For the moment, I've raised my rating to a 9 since I really enjoy the tough decisions of which cards to play and where I should go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I'm rating it a 9.5 after three long solo sessions, the game just keeps getting better with each play.  

There is enough complexity and depth in the game play to keep things interesting as a solo game.  I'll be playing with another player soon and I expect the game to be even better with two players.

The deck building mechanic does a good job of simulating character growth over time.  Add in artifacts to loot, spells to buy, allies to recruit, new abilities cards and skill tokens per level and you get characters that start the game the same but end the game vastly different.  

There are monster dens to clear out, dungeons to raid, ruins to explore, keeps and mage towers to siege, cities to conquer, villages to plunder, and monastaries to burn.  The game also tracks your allignment through out the game.  You can be evil and burn monastaries for their rare artifacts or good which makes it easier for you to recruit new and powerful allies.

All in all this is a great game and I look forward to many expansions in the near future.

After playing this solitaire, I have to say that it is definitely as epic as comments and session reports claim. What I absolutely LOVE is that it has strategic fantasy battles WITHOUT DICE to determine success, YAY! The flexibility of having solitaire, cooperative, and competitive modes means I can play it in many situations. It also has great art, table presence, and replayability. The single biggest flaw (and it is HUGE) is that it takes [I]freaking forever[/I] to play through an entire game. That is going to have a serious impact on the number of times I'll be able to get it to the table.

My second tabletop upon entering the scene 2 weeks ago. I followed the Top Solo list of BGG, and luckily found a local reseller with Mage Knight.
Yeah, superb solo play. The experience with dummy player is quite tedious on my first game, but then I found a mobile app that serves as the dummy and really leveled-up the solo gameplay experience by getting rid of extra shuffling, drawing, etc. off of the dummy.  
Read the walkthrough and rulebook for hours, and extremely happy that I now understand most of the rules even if I haven't finished my second game yet.
I can see future hundreds of hours sinking into this game. It is just that great.

While Descent is my favourite, it does have flaws. People not accustomed to RPGs are usually put-off by the game. Well, Mage Knight is a remedy for those - while it's still an adventure game, it's more of a strategy and tactic - reminds me a lot of Heroes of Might and Magic PC game (early sequels).
This game beats all other adventure games. It's only flaw is that it takes very long to play. But the game is perfect.

**update**
Sept 2015 - have finally managed to play well enough to enable a decisive 2 player win. This game is just great.

May 2014. I think this game definitely deserves to be ranked with the classics. There is so much to this game that is innovative and unique. Sure it's not really a 4-5 player game. But as a solo or 2 player game. This rocks! This is what my rating is based on.


Another excellent solo game. Have enjoyed a 2 player co-op but probably wouldn't play beyond that many players due to analysis time. By my 5th game I'm certainly feeling more confident taking out basic enemies such as orcs/dragons beige counters and the occasional spell-caster. Still feeling a little daunted with assaulting cities. I think my error currently is ignoring towers thinking they are tough, but they don't look that bad really, considering I have had success with mage towers. Definitely a game that rewards player perseverance. If you only invest 1 or 2 games playing MK it is not enough to grasp the concepts and strategies completely.

RATING: 7
Interesting game of exploration and conquering. Several ways to earn victory points with bonuses for having the most in a category. Movement takes a lot of cards but I think it helps the play to make players really think about what they can do in a turn.

RATING: 9
This game is epic is almost every sense of the word, and it has certainly earned its place as one of the best solo games ever created.   It creates a big adventure for you every game, and only through clever card play do you make it through successfully.   The artwork is great and the game comes packed with stuff, including miniatures that are of similar quality to the ones the [i]old[/i] Mage Knight games were known for.   There are a whole bunch of different scenarios each with a ton of variability within them, so you'll always be facing something new each time you play.


On the downside, this can be an epic brain-burner too, with many turns where you spend several minutes just staring at your cards trying to figure out how best to get where you want to go and do what you want to do as efficiently as possible.   I suspect that downtime with just two players would be significant, and with three or four would be unbearable even when everyone did know what they were doing, much less with anyone new.    There are TONS of pieces to this game and everything has its own unique rules, so unless you're playing this several times per week you're going to be spending a lot of time checking the rules and reference sheets to check how things are meant to work.

I have a few concerns about the bounded nature of turns and the lack of interaction in multiplayer, but this is, without a doubt, my favorite adventure-style game.  Look forward to playing again, though I'm not certain I would ever contemplate a game of MKBG with more than three players.  ADDENDUM:  Amazing solo game.  More satisfying and engaging than any other solo game I've played, with the exception of Magic Realm.  Outstanding.

I gave it a second play because the first one left me ambivalent, I'm a big fan of a lot of Chvatil's games, and this one is both visually and thematically attractive to me.  The second play convinced me that I probably don't need to play this again.

There is a complete disconnect between theme and mechanics.  Each turn is a puzzle on how you'll do something good with the cards in your hand, but it doesn't make sense that something as basic as, for example, moving from place to place is so constrained in an adventure/exploration game.  Movement costs are high so moving around the board takes a long time if you don't clear things out in sequence.  There's very little to do on an opponent's turn because you need to see how the mana dice are going to come up in order to plan.  

Combat feels very generic--each time trying to total things up to get just the right number of range attack, block, or attack to defeat the monster.  Repeated number crunching to get things to work out just right gets old fast.  And I'm a mathematician.

Character advancement comes from a relatively small number of skill tiles that you can acquire during the game, new spell, skill, and artifact cards that you add to your deck, and followers that join you.  But the cards come into your hand at random (of course) so your new spells or abilities won't necessarily be there when you need them.  Your followers, while always available, can only be used once per day or night and they take up a precious turn to acquire.

Which brings up another problem:  you actually only get a small number of turns over the whole game, I'm guessing 4 to 6 turns per day or night (each day or night is called a round) with a game lasting 4 to 6 rounds.  Now there can't really be more turns in the game because each individual turn drags so much, but that still doesn't leave many opportunities to actually do something.

The whole thing just feels like an exhausting exercise rather than an fantasy adventure.

Tedious.

There's so much to discover in Mage Knight, each play reveals something new. It's been a tremendously fun process learning this game. I find myself wanting to play it a lot and its length means it is replacing several other games for table time. It's more puzzle than adventure game and consequently it's the best dungeon-hack boardgame I've played and the only game I've found that's worth spending much time on solo.

Very heavy game. Thematically enjoyable, figurines are nice, cards have great artwork. The game flows well once you understand how everything works. The reference cards are so helpful.
Cards felt flimsy and cheap, however. Sleeved instantly with FFG Grays (FFG way more consistently better than Mayday, albeit more expensive)

I can tell this game will be hard to find players for, may end up just being for wife and me.

Have 4-5 full plays now, this game is still awesome. The game isn't as complex as I originally assumed at first. All the pieces just feel overwhelming.

2015/2/15: Played the intro scenario with Schrope. Woof. Quite the beast of a game; lots of smaller mechanisms dancing around creating a much large machine. Once you get to grips with all the intricacies of each mechanism (combat, moving, card/deck manipulation, etc. etc. etc.), things start to fall together.

I'm not entirely certain how heavy a game it is; it might just need a better fucking rule book. As is, it makes sense but it's like trying to read a tech manual: 'See page 342 for information on DRAWING Cards' 'See page 107 on DISCARDING cards.' 'For information on when to DRAW or DISCARD cards, see table 4b on page 44.' It's an endless sprawl of references, or in the worst cases, no references on how to complete a given action/task within the game. So you spend half the time searching for key words or unrelated sections to find an answer to your rules question.

A few parts are still ambiguous and will require further play or a FAQ. Overall though, I enjoy what the game does and how it does it. I seek further plays to cement an opinion.

This puts everything I want out of a board game in a single box. The rules are absolutely dense and hard to approach.

But it's an amazing and engrossing experience once you get over that hurdle.

If games interest you this will show you what they're capable of. I absolutely recommend it if you're a board gamer.

If you're just getting into the hobby though, wait a little bit. This is a steep game, familiarity with mechanics and learning games will actually help the experience.

Exceedingly fiddly for the first few, well numerous plays, but it's getting better.  This barrier to entry meant the game sat in my closet unopened for months before I decided to commit despite my reservations.  Mage Knight is difficult to play (correctly), but I can't deny I'm falling in love with its masterful game design.

For a solo experience however, the base game feels limited in scenario offerings.  There is only one solo scenario (I don't count the intro scenario (First Reconnaissance) since it has such limited replayability) as opposed to the 9 other Coop or competitive scenarios.  This limited solo scenario issue seems more or less addressed with the Lost Legion expansion I have yet to break out.

I'm scoring it a 6 for now, but expect this score to climb once I get past the mechanics and legislation of rules.

Note: Out of 7 plays so far, I have yet to actually finish a game (my solo conquest games stretch 3+ hours).  It's too large to leave set out since my 1 year old would destroy or misplace everything!

This is THE definitive fantasy board game. The amount of depth is amazing. The components are top notch. It really is a thinking man's game. It hits all the right notes: theme, action, planning, hand management, solo/co-op/pvp, and has a very minor reliance on luck. This game is unique in how it plays and there are so many choices and things to do it's impressive. 

Only cons for me is the game length can get excessive and the lack of a character building feature. I'd love to get some armor and weapon upgrades...but I understand this is more puzzle than adventure and you do "technically" get some character advancement.

After a few plays of Mage Knight, I had given it a low rating and was ready to trade it away. For whatever reason I kept feeling the need to try again -- maybe it's the colorful art, maybe it's the cool little miniatures, or maybe it just speaks to my inner nerd with fireballs and dragons and magic spells. When I had that game where everything clicked, only then did I understand why this game is so highly regarded. It might take a game or two, or in my case, seven, but it's definitely worth the price of admission.

Only game I've ever rated a ten. I could never imagine playing a board game solo, infact I find the idea of it just dreadful. But I've now played 4 solo games of Mage Knight and I have no intention of stopping. It's Diablo the board game. I find my self wanting to play this over video games when I need to game alone. It's also great 2-3 player. Awesome, awesome game.

This is the game that started it all for me back in 2012.

For a game that truly love, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of it. I have played the Full Conquest scenario with 2 players, the walk-through of this game solo, with 3 players and with 4 players. The walkthrough is a great way to get your feet wet but it doesn't really shine until you start playing the scenarios... and with respect to that... I've only played one of the 9 (?) included scenarios.

To this day, I haven't played a game that comes close to combining so many different things in such unique ways. It's as much a brain-burning puzzle as it is an epic fantasy exploration and combat game. There is so much going on and so many tough decisions to make on every turn. How you can use the cards in so many ways is amazing, and the fact that they act as the round timer make you agonize about how to optimize every single action. That leads me to my next point...

Overall, I think that this game is amazing as a solo game and great with 2 players. However, once you get over 2 players, you need to be ready for a very long game unless the people are experienced and don't take a ton of time with their turns. The nature of the game and its mechanics leads to AP. I do think that this would decrease dramatically as the players became more used to the game and its mechanics but the fact that it's such a heavy and time (and space) consuming game... that becomes a very difficult obstacle to overcome.

I believe that this will remain a game that sees limited plays over the years and is something that I'd end up playing more solo than with a group of people. It's unfortunate that such an amazing game will forever be caught in a cycle of gathering dust only to be brushed of once in a blue moon but I guess that's the nature of the beast and where I currently am in the stage of my life.

For me, this is the best game I've played. As a fan of fantasy, deck building, and role-playing, I believe this combines them all into a nearly flawless package. The time commitment is pretty high, but if you have 1-2 others who are willing to invest an afternoon, it will be worth it! Any more than 3 really slows the game down.

Wonderful game design, but it's a serious time commitment and I would certainly never play it with more than three players, given the lengthy turns. Sure, we might get marginally faster with regular play (if that's even possible), but I don't see us getting that much faster. The fact that each card has two uses, and can also be played sideways for basic actions, just leads to a whole ton of permutations to consider.

This can be enjoyable to me, and is in other games, but here it becomes slow, and rather frustrating.

Would I play it again? Well, perhaps solo, but not otherwise.

First two sessions devoted to this were looong and incredibly uninteresting.

I want to feel empowered while playing this type of game. Instead, the game continually tells me what I can't do. Much like [i]Eclipse[/i], this game feels like an Emperor's new clothes kind of thing.

While playing, I look about the table continually hoping that somebody else will say unprompted, "This game's awful - let's play anything else," but nobody ever does.

At its core, [i]Mage Knight[/i] is a boring, run-of-the-mill adventure game with a terrible battle system. Then the designer chose to ladle on top a syrup of tedious deck building.

Each soporific turn feels like wading through Tapioca pudding that has hardened...

This felt like D&D The Board Game, and I loved it. I don't even like D&D but it gave me the feeling people have told me about. This sprawling adventure, these terrible monsters, and the fantastic strategy of making the most of what you've got at hand. It was mesmerizing, and I cannot wait until my second play. And I managed to win! So cool.

Like this better than his Galaxy Trucker, Space Alert, or Dungeon Lords.  Way better than other exploring games like Runebound, Return of the Heroes, or Prophecy.  Yet,I still don't like this as much as I think I should.  The deck building mechanic has its limitations.  If you don't draw the cluster of attack, move, or influence cards at the right time, then you won't be successful.  That brings more luck into the game than I would prefer.

I got this game because i was searching a thematic game to play in solitaire. I was not fan of solitaire games, but unfortunely my friends were not available regulary for playing games such as Mansions of Madness or Imperial assault. We loved these games, specially the last, but the lenght turned off everybody. In the other hand, I couldn't play alone the mentioned games because the need of a Master, and there are many things to track. 
I found in Mage Knight the solution for a thematic game that I can stop and continue, so the time doesn't matter. It is really inmersive and at the same time challenging and deep; you can really focus on your quest because you don't feel like schizofrenic changing from one character traits to another. At the same time you don't feel constrained and you have many paths for victory.

I wish It could be shorter so my friends can play it with me, otherwise I really enjoy this game.

There's a game here, but it isn't what many people expect. It's not a deck building game and it's not a dungeon crawler. It's a strategic deck handling pseudo-adventure. It's a bit different.

내가 처음으로 정식 룰 설명하게 된 게임. 많은 내용과 상당한 잔룰로 인해 룰 숙지에 많은 어려움이 있는 덱빌딩 RPG게임이다. 덕분에 다른 어려운 게임들도 상대적으로 룰이 간단해 보이는 착시 현상을 느끼게 되었다.
부르심님한테 배우고 han79님한테 전수해 줬었지. 솔직히 솔로플 포함해 17판이나 해서 더 하고 싶은 생각은 별로 없다. 단지 확장이 나올 것 같아서 처분을 보류 중이다.

Own with Lost Legion. I love this game. I play Solo and I bend a few rules to turn it into an (easier) open world RPG with no time limit and leave it on the table and play through out the week. I start with a standard Volkaire start on a big table. As I get to the sides, I just keep adding tiles and exploring and if I run out then I pick up one of three of the tiles furthest away and shuffle them. Once I get to the max level, I go back to 0 and use the better Units. Every day that passes, Volkaire ticks up one level. Game is over when I defeat Volkaire so it can be a shorter game if I choose. It's so immersive and unlike anything else I've played. Great for inspiring writing and great for avoiding writing! It really does capture the theme for me. It's a wonderful game

This is a highly thematic, very fiddly, adventure game with a side order of deckbuilding. The first couple games I played of this I wasn't enamored because I felt like I got stuck being unable to do what I wanted to on a given turn.

As you acclimatize to the game, however, it becomes pretty amazing. You need to get used to the scarcity of your various pure action cards (move, attack, block, and influence) and learn when to hold and have a subpar turn rather than just playing your entire hand sideways for the immediate need. Once you get to that point, Mage Knight completely opens up.

I love the feeling that the game evokes as you advance in levels - you gain new abilities, more cards, minions, and stats. It does an amazing job of capturing your character's power growing.

One of those games I wish I could love - but remain at "very good" level. My problem so far has always been, that with more players the game just becomes way too time-consuming. I have played the solitaire-mode a couple of times, which is nice. But for me, boardgames are a social affair. And once we are 3 or more, and don´t have all night to play, there is just no chance for this beauty to lift the lid.

Colosal. Pídele y te será concedido. Un juego en formato Scope, necesitarás mesa. Hay quien dice que las partidas a un buen wargame son memorables y se recuerdan siempre, mientras que las de un euro no. Con Mage Knight cualquier prejuicio o complejo al comparar euros con wargames queda completamente disipada. Después de catarlo el resto de tu colección brillará un poco menos. Toda una revelación.
--------------------------------------------------

Posiblemente sea mi solitario favorito. 

Precioso a todas luces. Descubre nuevos horizontes, enfréntate a todo aquello que sea tan ingenuo como para desafiarte. 

Que tu nombre se esparza por llanuras y haga retumbar las montañas hasta sus raíces. Empezarás sólo y terminarás al mando de legiones, serás leyenda.

Toda una experiencia.

Actualización:

Empiezas sólo y tienes ante ti tierras, montañas y tras estos anchos horizontes por explorar. Es de día y empiezas avanzando arrogante hacia una colina donde unos orcos tienen su tribu. En el combate se tiene la posibilidad primero de asediar o hacer una ataque a distancia con la idea de aniquilar al enemigo antes de que te pongan la mano encima. 

Con altivez le dices al orco más grande que "pegue". Me salto aquí todo el tema de los rasgos especiales que alteran, dan variedad y caracterizan maravillosamente cada bicho, mago, criatura, dragón, etc...

El orco golpea y tu armadura trata de absorver el daño- ya coges una carta con esa gotita de sangre tan chula en el centro- . Si no lo reduces a cero vuelves a aplicar tu índice de armadura para absorver el excedente adquiriendo una nueva carta de sangre. Estas cartas se te acumulan en la mano y MOLESTAN. No puedes deshacerte de ellas a menos que te cures y si no lo has hecho para cuando te toca descartar y remezclar tu mazo como cuando el día o la noche termina tu baraja se te queda sucia de sangre y volverán a salir cuando robes. Fantástico. 

El orco deja de sonreír cuando ve que tú también te ríes. Entonces te toca a TI. Usas tus cartas para atacar para acumular una cifra que iguale o supere la armadura del orco. Y muerto. Los destrozas y empiezan a correr rumores de un extraño ser que ha surgido de un portal y que no se sabe muy bien a qué viene. Ganas fama y prestigio.

Te acercas a una aldea cercana y puedes gastar tus cartas para curarte de tus heridas o reclutar más o menos amablemente a los que te seguirán en la búsqueda de no se sabe qué castillo. O también puedes saquear a los aldeanos  De ahí a asaltar fuertes, monasterios, ciudades; por el camino mazmorras, ruinas que encierran tesoros o prisoneros que se unirán a tu causa- sin importarles si es buena o mala-, tomando y dominando siniestras torres controladas por hechiceros de las que luego te podrás servir para reclutar; obtendrás anillos mágicos, alzarás poderosos estandartes.  

Y cuando vuelvas a pelear ya no lo harás sólo. Les dirás a tus guerrero cuándo, cómo y dónde golpear. Con los cristales de maná que guardes con codicia en el bolsillo y absorviendo los vientos de magia que soplen tanto por el día como por la noche potenciarás los efectos que desees de tus cartas e incluso de tus propias criaturas.

Tus soldados caeran rendidos de cansancio una vez los uses para lo que sea en cada jornada, pero tú no, porque tú eres un héroe y los héroes no duermen de noche. Errarás sin cesar con los ojos abiertos, azuzando a tu hueste con tus gruñidos. Tu poder crecerá sin cesar hasta que seas capaz de desintegrar de un sólo golpe incluso a un dragón. 

Y aunque no lo he probado, pues lo mío hasta ahora ha sido sólo un coqueteo con el juego, lo único que tal vez más debe infundir intranquilidad en tu mago-guerrero es que no está sólo en su búsqueda, hay otros como él que arrastran tras de sí por las llanuras todo tipo de criaturas temibles. A tus oído también llegan sus gestas y los horrores que han provocado, la fama de aquellos también crece. Y cuando te topes con ellos tal vez colaboréis por ejemplo para asaltar una inexpugnable ciudad o no.

Ocupa mucha mesa incluso jugando en solitario. El reglamento requiere una digestión lenta. Hay mucho contenido en él, muchas modos de juego distintos. Yo por ahora lo pondría en dificultad a la altura de Through the Ages. 

Nota: Ojito con pecar de confianza. 

Turno uno. Desde el portal veo un chamán orco cogiendo margaritas en un prado. Miro mis cartas y empiezo: digo, psé, llevo lo justo para llevarle al otro barrio. Asumiré las heridas sin una queja. 

Me muevo a su alrededor para llamar su atención cuál espontáneo impala frente a un hambriento guepardo. El sorprendido chamán aprovecha sus margaritas para invocar a un bravo minotauro llamado Ratón cuyo talante es de nivel cinco.

No puedo bloquearlo. Como tiene fuerza brutal el daño se duplica coincidiendo con el número de costillas que me parte. Me chupo cinco cartas de sangre en la mano y encima me noquea haciendo que me descarte de todas las cartas que llevo, y dejando mi mazo en pulpa y a carne viva. 

Luego el chamán sigue con sus margaritas...

I think this is the best solo gameplay boardgame. It has the same puzzle element as ghost stories but with a more epic feeling. It is also a very harsh and unforgiving game although you can adjust the level of difficulty. This is a game that builds up. You don't need all the rules in the first turn. You can gradually experience and learn the game. Although you'll probably not win your first games, since you need the knowledge of rules to evaluate the pieces and situations. 

There's a great deal of evaluating going on during play. Each turn you must evaluate everything from the cards in hand, to cards you could buy, to routes you will follow, units you bought or can buy, the mana that you'll pick etc. 

Since there is a lot of this kind of thinking involved, in a non solo game this can cause a lot of downtime. I would not play it with 3 or 4, but 2 seems fine. It takes some time to figure out all the rules, but in the end it is worth it.

I don't see what all the fuss is about. Its not quite a deckbuilder, its not quite an rpg, not quite a dungeon delver. It tried to be these things, and I feel fell rather short of the mark.

An adventure game that is so nearly great, but far too many clunky mechanics and rules bloat stop it from being so. This is a single player game disguised as a multiplayer, and woe betide anyone who dares play this with four - you're looking at a hell of a lot of downtime for one.
It's almost an interesting game, but falls short and just isn't that exciting. Sadly

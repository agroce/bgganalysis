The lack of strict timing on card powers (compared to Star Realms) makes this one a bit clunkier to play. Also one fewer colour for powers (black for starting cards doesn't count!) suggests this really wants (possibly already has, waiting in the wings) an additional colour/power set as an expansion.

Even if it's a re-theming of Star Realms, this trumps the original base game due to the smooth tweaks, 3-4 player variant and artwork with more personality. I'm down for playing either, mind you, but I'm excited to see where this goes and excited that Kastle let TMG license it. Solid, fun introductory deck builder.

Initial Impression: A poster-child for fast paced card games, the conflict ramps up from the get-go in this game. The beautiful cartoony artwork keeps the game feeling light and humorous but there's a fair amount of strategy involved in this PVP deckbuilder. Quick to teach, my son is now asking about the 4player mode so he can introduce some of his pre-teen friends to the game. I'm looking forward to more plays and am already wondering what any future expansions will bring to the table. 

10 Plays: Have I really played this game 10 times already? That was quick. The more I play this game, the more I want to play it. The 2P game is an interesting duel but I found that the 3P game is a mad scramble for survival. My son and I have now explored multiple strategies and find that there's still more to discover. The artwork is still fresh too :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Have both the physical deck as well as the iOs and PC versions and very much enjoy playing it. It is in my opinion similar enough to Star Realms to get a quick start and not have to think to much on the rules and still different enough to fell like its own game and while I play it I don't think about Star Realms at all..I think Cthulhu I'm gona kick your ass ;)

I love Star Realms but that is a game with art I really like and a great flow.  I didnt really connect with the theme here and I didnt like the choice of art style.  Mechanically this is so similar to Star Realms that I would have thought I would like it and appreciate the differences.  However not liking the idea of trying to make your opponent go insane, not liking the art, not thinking the theme fits the game etc.  all make this a game I will struggle to get into despite liking the mechanics and play.

A better published (box, sanity track) but worse version of Star realms. Going from 4 to 3 factions means there are less possible tactics and the games feel less different, using symbols everywhere and no text makes it confusing. Still there are some interesting combos and the play is a bit different, so might be a good choice if you're bored with Star Realms.

A fun update of Star Realm. There is a bit more going on here and it's not as easy to pick up.

It's otherwise easy to double count or double activate abilities when there are multiple trigger conditions.

RATING: 6
Downgraded rating due to general impenetrability of the icon scheme.

---

Well, I may have spoken slightly prematurely. The 3/4 player version of this is tolerable. That's better than Star Realms (you can back-port the rules to Star Realms), but it's still not actually that good; you're looking at primarily 2p.

The icons also are impressively confusing for non-Star Realms vets, or to anyone really, until you get the hang of it. In the main it's OK, but at times they get weird.

Anyway, this hasn't *quite* clicked as well as I had hoped on first impression, given that I'm a big Ascension fan and I find Star Realms to be pretty decent. Really, this one, you're in it for the fun Cthulhu art. Which is definitely not nothing.
---
This was fun and a nice re-skin of Star Realms. Star Realms is a fine game with roughly 4 significant problems: unreadable type sizes, boring art, lousy multiplayer options, and the fact that Ascension exists. By switching to icons which are more or less useable, flavorful cartoony Cthulhu art, and a semi-reasonable multiplayer option, Cthulhu Realms seems to improve on the original. From a gameplay perspective it's still certainly no Ascension, but unlike Star Realms it does legitimately give you something that Ascension does not (fun cartoony Cthulhu flavor). Anyway, Ascension is still unquestionably the king of this particular hill, but Cthulhu Realms seems like a fun change of pace, and it's cheap.

I'm not a big deckbuilder enthusiast and not much a fan of the Cthulhu mythos so I wasn't expecting much of this game. It turned to be a nice little game that I can see myself playing again at some point. I enjoyed the different abilities provided by cards in each of the 3 colors which gives the ability for players to create nice little combos. The way the cars are setup so that each player only has access to 2 of the 3 rows was also a nice little twist to add some variability.

While I prefer it to Star Realms, that really isn't saying much. It improves on the faction forcing by only having three factions, but it remains a buy the better cards and win game. And buying the better cards is mostly a question of luck. Much like SR, it is billed as a kill the other player game, but with two players, it's really just the first to fifty points wins disguised as attacking.

Ascension is still the best version of this game, although it's not really to my taste either.

This is a little more complicated than Star Realms.  Some of the iconography on the cards are a little confusing and I find myself having to go back to the rules regularly to remind myself.

This re-theme of a knock-off of a knock-off slaps the tired Lovecraft theme onto the tired deck-building system. The "advancement" here is that there are now at least three different possibilities for ability prerequisites, plus choices of which ability to use, so a player turn can take a considerable time to complete.  But At least we get to see the designer's name on every single card.

I love [thing=147020][/thing] and [thing=69789]Ascension[/thing] and even though this game is great as well, it doesn't quite reach the level of its ancestors.

The main reason for this is that the iconography could have used some work. Not only could they have cleared up a few things, keeping track of which powers you've used already can become quite tricky. I use little tokens to cover up the icons I've triggered or that I can't use to keep an oversight of my options and that's helped a lot.

It's a bit of a bummer because the game's strongest point is that it's very portable and has great and funny artwork. It's still a keeper for me, mainly because it's very small and supports up to 4 players.

[i]Edit:[/i] Hero Realms came out and killed it. It also supports up to 4 players and I like that incarnation of the system even a bit more than Star Realms (and thereby Cthulhu Realms). No reason to own four games of the same type.

An almost straight re-theme of star realms, however game play allows for a multiplayer experience.Its interesting. 

I quite like the cartoony artwork and despite the game having quite a lot of symbols it is fairly easy to pick up and play. I just wish the player summary was a bit more indepth as especially during my first game I had to keep asking for clarification of what exactly cards could do. 

I also found it frustrating that on some cards actions with prerequisites appear above the standard actions. A minor niggle but certainly adds to confusion during first few plays.

I don't know exactly why, but I don't like this nearly as much as Star Realms.  I don't care for the symbology -- even though it's on the player aid, I find myself having to look up terms in the rules occasionally.  I also think the cards are more expensive than Star Realms, leading to the situation (especially early game) where you can't buy anything.

I think this game is a bit underrated in general. It offers a lot of strategy for being such a portable game with not that many cards and I also find it easy to learn. I always play this as a 2-player game so I'm not sure how it works with higher playercounts. 
There has been a lot of discussion regarding the artwork but I think it's great; appropriate with a bit of humour thrown in.

Version Cthulhuploitation du célèbre STAR REALMS. Comme le jeu originel est bon, celui-ci aussi. Les points de vie deviennent des points de SAN, qu'on essaie d'amener à 0 chez l'adversaire. Les dessins sont comiques et réussis. Il ne s'agit cependant vraiment que d'un re-skin, c'est ça qui est dommage. J'aurais aimé que les cartes fassent descendre les points de SAN du lanceur plus que celui de la cible, qu'il aurait fallu sauver avec ses propres passages à l'asile pour espérer perdre moins que l'adversaire... Ca aurait été plus ambiance.
Enfin, si vous n'avez aucun jeux (whatever) REALMS et que vous aimez le poulpe, autant prendre celui-là. Sinon, restez-en à STAR REALMS.

autores y "motor" de Star Realms, aplicado a tematica mitos de cthulhu. 

deck building sencillito y entretenido. en mi opinion algunas mecanicas de juego son algo absurdas. principalmente que algunos efectos potenciados requieren "destruir" la carta (devolverla a la caja del juego)... pero otros lo que requieren es descartarla (devolverla al mazo de descarte de donde se podrá recuperar despues). en la mayoria de casos "destruir" la carta no sale a cuenta.

I really like the fun art style, which makes it stand out from the other Lovecraft-inspired games. Iconography takes a little bit of time to get used to, but still fun. This ones sits very close to the "Replaced by its own app" category, but not quite.

Definitely the weakest of the three "Realms" games.

In my opinion, this game greatly surpasses Star Realms - the game that Cthulhu Realms was based on.  Your starting deck allows you get into the meat of the game quicker, the artwork is better, it handles up to 4 players, and there are more combos.

I really like Star Realms, this was a no brainer. I like the adjure ability especially if you can bounce the card back into discard using another card. Doesnt happen often and so far I have leaned heavily Yellow with a bit of fuscia for healing. A splash of green for damage.

Thought it might be a fun change.  Although interesting, it ultimately let us down.  In particular, the turns got too big to be fun.  Constantly checking pre-requisites and trying to keep track of what icons you had already used was not fun.  And yet, if you didn't get to the big turns, that wasn't fun either.  Just a catch-22 of disappointment.

A retheming of Star Realms that is good though seemingly a bit more complex(?).  I'm not 100% sure about that but it feels that way. Still, I like it enough that I sold Star Realms and I play Cthulhu Realms, not Star Realms, on my phone somewhat regularly.

Cthulhu version of star realms.

Fun and easy deckbuilder in the same style as star realms.

One major complaint is the symbols on the cards used to determine effects are sometimes not very obvious and having to reference them in the middle of a game can start to annoy players especially if it's their first time playing.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (September 2017)

I never liked Star Realms that much so when I found out Cthulhu Realms was similar my interest in the game plummeted. As it turned out, I can say both games are very similar and , somewhat, boring for me.

The rules of the game are pretty simple to explain (and very similar to Star Realms). You can do it under 3 minutes. Playtime is around 20 minutes.

In general, I love deckbuilding games but I hate games that have a variable market offering. I find them to be very unfair and mostly tactics as opposed as a game of Dominion in which you can plan your whole game right from the beginning. The decisions needed to play Cthulhu Realms (and Star Realms for that matter) are pretty obvious. Luck is very high and will decide many matches.

It is best with 2 players, with more players it becomes even more random.

I like the theme, but you don’t feel it except through the name of the cards and the art is which is very good. The game has icons instead of text,   you learn the icons quickly so it works but I think I prefer text.. It only has 3 factions instead of four.

I already sold my copy of the game and I plan to continue to play the game on the iPad. On app form the issues I have with the game are felt much less.

Bottom line, Cthulhu Realms is almost a copy of Star Realms. I prefer Star Realms but I don’t like either game. I already sold them both and I plan to play them online. Both games have pretty easy decisions. It plays fast. The luck factor in uncontrollable and very high.

Current Rating: 4.0

Very fun with 2 players (haven't tried more), I haven't played Star Realms either. Not sure I "need" to get Star Realms anymore.

The only downside is that it can get somewhat confusing and difficult to follow later in the game, when you start to chain all these combinations and try to remember what you've activated and what not.

Edit: We do not find much trouble with the symbols.

Great game. Was not to keen on the cartoon art, but it really suits this game. Was a three player game, first time ever. The 3 player set up and play was awesome. Well done. just great.

挾著Cthulhu背景的Cthulhu Realms，是設計師Darwin Kastle在去年設計的卡牌遊戲，Darwin Kastle 因 Star Realms 而成名，近來也有台灣代理商代理了中文版，究竟這款看似機制類似主題卻南轅北側的卡片遊戲究竟有甚麼差別?
首先Cthulhu Realms將卡牌的能力全面改為圖像化，這讓原本習慣Star Realms 的玩家還挺不適應，不過圖像化的描述的確讓玩家可以更快的了解卡牌能力，但結算時需要更清楚的辨別，事實上圖示化是可讓遊戲更容易的上手。再來Cthulhu Realms主要分成三種顏色的卡牌，相較於Star Realms 的四種派系，Cthulhu Realms讓玩家更容易形成combo，另一種說法就是玩家成就感會累積的更快，我想這也是好遊戲不可或缺的部分。這個遊戲在"移除"牌的部分做了很多聯攜效果，感覺更偏向牌庫構築的部分。
另一個不同的點，是Darwin Kastle 將Cthulhu Realms設計成可以四人同時進行的遊戲，雖然是四人混戰的局面，但遊戲中可以購買的牌卻有分別，每兩個玩家各有自己購買的牌堆，但是攻擊卻可以分別給予，有別於先前作者設計的 Epic 及 Star Realms，我不敢說這樣的設計有甚麼不好，不過對於兩人遊戲的轉型，這倒是很好的嘗試。
基本上我對 Cthulhu Realms 的評價是略高於 Star Realms，除卻主題很粉絲取向不說，遊戲的設計及親切程度都較優於前作，希望還能多跑幾場~~~~

Took a functioning game system and broke it.  Game is not colorblind friendly and uses symbols instead of text making it too fiddly to remember/understand cards and sterile.

Also cards scale much too quickly (a problem for Star Realms that is even worse here).  Strategy is basically get money cards early, then buy the most expensive card available each turn as a cost X card is demonstratively better than a cost X-1 card. 

One fewer color, two self-trashing starter cards, and an abundance of trashing effects makes it trivial to combo colors, so you don't even need to worry much about whether that highest-costing card will combo well with your deck--it will.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a compressed and accelerated version of Star Realms - only three colours, no 1-cost cards, more ways/requirements for abilities to trigger, a couple of "Explorers" in your starting deck - so it's not bad or anything. But given the horrible art and iconography, and Star Realms being alive and expanded, interest is low and likely to so remain.

Lame "re-implementation" of Star Realms. Playtesting could have been a lot better - some cards are just plain broken e.g Miskatonic University others make no sense - why should "Terrible Old Man" cause me to gain sanity?? Artwork is good and fits the theme. Needs more "Epicness" as it never really feels like you are utilising the Great Old Ones for your purposes. No real replayability, after a couple of games you have pretty seen at all- For R'lyeh.

Being a competitive and quite spiteful player, I love this game.
This deck building game is one of my favorites. 
It is a small, convenient size and has several strategies to playing. 
I'm usually the type to buy up all the high damage out put monsters, which is often met with everyone buying all the defensive structures ever!

If you like deck building games that will drive your friends to hate you for the next 24 hours, I would recommend this game.

I did not realized with the title that it was a variation of Star Realms. Now that the APP is released, I managed to play and discover this game. It's very similar to star realms and Ascension, but it's a bit more complex. I only played once digitally so far, so I imagine I should get more familiar with more plays.

My suggestion is that first try star realms, get familiar with it and then try cthulhu realms. Both base apps are free, so you can try them anytime you want. Star realm even have a pc version.

Cthulhu realms seems a bit more complex, but I am not entirely sure if it's because they use icons instead of text abilities or if it's because all cards have special abilities.

I am not sure about the game balance, in the original star realms, cards that thinned the deck were way too powerful and they made them more expensive in the colony wars expasion. Here in cthulhu wars they are even more accessible, I managed to get a deck with less than 10 cards and no basic cards.

Some of the differences with star realms is that there is only 3 faction colors, and destroyed cards goes into a temporary pool. Some cards can bring them back or have an ability activate if there is a card in that pool.  So there is a bit more special ability interaction than have another card with a matching color in play. The starting hand is a bit better, and the "cultist" (scout) is also a bit better. You can also see the next card to be put in the buy zone since the cards are face up. Very interesting as it could influence which card you buy. Finally "bases" can either protect the player or protect other bases.

As you can see, a couple of tweaks here and there, more abilities options and no text abilities, only icons, which can make the game language independent. I'll have to play more, but I doubt it will be horrible.

I jumped on the Star Realms hypewagon last year but hopped off pretty quickly. I didn't find it to be a game with any legs, and each match seemed to play pretty much the same. I didn't try out any of the expansions, but that's okay. Cthulhu Realms is a re-skin of the original game with LOL Cthulhu graphics, which is a theme I'm only slightly more tired of than just plain regular Cthulhu. This game adds a few things to the Star Realms idea, though, and they're kind of interesting. Cards have multiple actions, some of which are triggered by actions or other cards, so a turn can really cascade. That's kind of fun. I liked it more than vanilla Star Realms, but I'd still rather play Valley of the Kings or Zeppelin Attack than either one.

Habe das Spiel auf der Spiel 2015 getestet. Mein Fazit nach dieser einen Partie:
Vom Ablauf her sehr ähnlich dem verwandten Star Realms. Nun aber eben mit Cthulhu Thema und nicht mehr im Weltraum. Allerdings hat mir das Star Realms spontan etwas besser gefallen. 

Bei Cthulhu Realms wurde nun praktisch ganz auf Kartentexte verzichtet und stattdessen mit Symbolen gearbeitet. Im Prinzip eine gute Idee, denn so müssen nur die Übersichten übersetzt werden und nicht auch noch alle Karten. Allerdings will die Symbolik zunächst erlernt werden und war für unsere Runde jedenfalls nicht sofort selbsterklärend.

Umgekehrt hat man sich einmal an die etwas eigenwillige Symbolik gewöhnt, können damit vermutlich - ähnlich wie bei den Karten von Race for the Galaxy auch - sehr viele Informationen auf einen Blick übermittelt werden.

Die enthaltenen Übersichten fungieren zudem auch als Anzeige der Lebenspunkte, die durch das Verschieben eines kleinen Gehirns auf der Zahlenleiste markiert werden. Was wiederum deutlich schneller geht als das Abwerfen und Aufnehmen von Lebenspunkten in Form von Karten wie bei Star Realms.

Ich würde wieder mitspielen, werde das Spiel aber vorerst nicht in unsere Sammlung aufnehmen.

I love this game.

On the down side, after over 30 hours of playtime (not just 30 games), I've sort of homed-in on a stronger play strategy and there's no real way around it. As such, if you don't get access to certain cards, you're pretty much out of luck... Also, I'm not sure about the colour balance. (Yellow seems on the weak side as a primary... ?)

All this being said, I will always say yes to a game! It's fun, it's quick, the cards are funny ( I'm a sucker for puns ) and there's enough choice / strategy to keep me engaged.

Love this game.

An intriguing revamp of the Star Realms system.  I like the artwork, (generally) the move to 3 colors, and I like some of the subtle mechanical tweaks (protection for you separate from locations, and trashing cards only costing 6 or less and from multiple zones).  I'm not sure I like the move to complete iconography.  And, I haven't yet found the synergy within a color.  Thus, I still tend to go for "good stuff" decks.  This may climb a tad higher over time.

Cthulhu Realms est un bon jeu de deck building assez bourrin. Le fait que l'on commence la partie avec 50 points de santé mentale, qui peuvent être regagnés, montre bien qu'on va sortir des cartes qui vont faire des dégâts. C'est plaisant justement de pouvoir sortir de grosses cartes ^^.
La thématique Cthulhu est au rendez vous mais elle me semble essentiellement réservée aux connaisseurs, la majorité des personnes/joueurs habitués à ce thème ne retrouveront peut être pas tous les éléments auxquels ils sont habitués.
Un super plus de ce jeu comparé à son jeu d'origine "Star Realms" est que Cthulhu Realms peut être joué de 2 à 4 joueurs et ça fait toute la différence! Surtout que les cartes à acheter sont reparties entre chaque joueur, et les attaques sont simultanées sur 2 joueurs.
Ce jeu est plaisant mais nécessite tout de même un certain niveau d'amateurisme des autres joueurs pour pouvoir le sortir

I know this one's older brother gets all the love, and that some have issues with iconography, but I find it more fun to play in terms of literal joy.  The "story" line makes me laugh, as does the artwork.  I think many of the iconography issues stem from people expecting it to be exactly the same as Star Realms, and it's not.  I wish it would get some additional expansions, but I don't really expect to ever see any.

Giving this a low score because of the unsatisfactory and long unwelcome gameplay, tiny card symbols are too hard to notice, most games almost ended in a stalemate because of the high cost of trade row cards and no access to initiates because they were all scrapped away so mostly no coins to buy new cards. Playing with trade row deck face up feels wrong and trying to work out some labrinthine card activations was a pain. Score may go up if we play some more and add some house rules like initiates always are scrapped back to the initiate pool of cards.

RATING: 6
I've only played it twice and both times felt that there was a bit too much card-combo interaction which slowed the pace of the game and made it overstay and grow a bit stale toward the end. Perhaps with repeated plays and more familiarity with the cards, I'd grow to not only like but love the card-combo-heavy nature of this one as it certainly is the most "thinky" of the Realms games to date. But, my initial reaction was that it sort of lacks the quick & brutal engine-building aspect that makes the "Realms" series uniquely fun. 

So far, my favorite is "Star Realms: Colony Wars" which seems less swingy & runaway-leader prone than the original (the original gave the blue faction too much healing power which occasionally resulted in one person not only winning, but winding up with more health points than they had at the beginning of the game.) Colony wars retains that breathlessly fast knife-fight-in-a-phonebooth engine building aspect. Cthulhu Realms is well done and has fantastic production, but seems a bit heavy/fiddly for what it is.

Have you heard of Star Realms? Yeah it is essentially the same thing different theme. Cool theme. The symbols are somewhat hard to figure out and can be very small. There are a few rules differences but otherwise the same play. I have to say it is good, if only since I love Star Realms, but I am a Star Realms girl at heart- it is my game. Nothing will replace Star Realms. I will play this one every so often I suppose.

31-10-2015. Ok. I like this better than Star Realms, even though they're basically the same game. Both feature simple ascension style deck-building, both have 'allied' colors to combo with to unlock stronger special abilities.

However, there are small changes. You basically start with an explorer in your starting-deck, speeding up the game a little. There are only 3 types of cards (green, purple, orange) and instead of text they feature a symbol language, making gameplay intuitive once it clicks. The outposts are changed too, they now protect people, nothing, or other outposts. 

I really liked it.

In many ways, this is superior to Star Realms. The art is nicer and it's much easier to trash (abjure) cards. There's less factions but the trading faction of SR was never that good anyway and the red faction was only there to help you trash cards. What holds it back is using icons instead of text (app helps with this) and a weaker theme. I can appreciate how losing sanity would destroy locations in an odd way, but it's less intuitive than acquiring ships/bases. It's chunkier than SR but that also makes it less clean. Maybe after expansions come out, I'll be more enthused.

The symbology is too confusing for me to enjoy this game as much as Star Realms or Hero Realms, but I've never been a Lovecraft fan so the theme doesn't excite me either. After 2 plays, I still need to check the rules frequently, where the symbols aren't well described. I do like that it played equally well with 2 and 4 players.

RATING: 1
I was curious about Star Realms and although it's a sister game, they're similar enough to see what's going on. It seems this to be mostly Ascension variant and the so-called attacking doesn't feel like attacking. You're mostly just building an engine and at one point some players will break through and kill the other one - but it's not so much about conflict, but efficiency and combos. And speaking of combos it seems we came a long way since Dominion and its completely impenetrable card synergies, no Realms don't offer thematic cohesion, but card synergies are nicely colour coded for you convenience so it's easier to find pre-baked "strategies". 

The game is completely themeless, illustrations notwithstanding, maybe the Star Realms theme gelled better with gameplay. There's no narrative. There's just combos and the amount of them is crazy - each turn you're faced with 5-10 icons and have to figure out what to do with them. Feels like some sort of video game addiction where you click and click (and shuffle) and somebody wins. Yawn.

Rating down to 1.0 because: Why does this exist? It's a game designed to make you shuffle the deck through clever use of rules. You could just shuffle the deck without "game" and experience would be similarly engaging, but shorter.

While the gameplay doesn't feel quite as tight as Star Realms, I feel that this game handles more than two players far better. The symbols may seem intimidating at first, since there is no text on the cards to explain what each card does, but you actually get used to them very quickly.

The artwork is cartoony, but very amusing and while we have only played one game so far, we had a blast and plan to play again soon.

This is just a different themed Star Realms and in my opinion Star Realms is a very mediocre game.  Just take a gander at my Star Realms review to see a more detailed explanation why I feel that way but the short of it is that Star Realms is a pretty near clone of Ascension.  The same thing I said for that game applies here.  Unless you really like the space theme of Star Realms, Ascension is a better (although in my opinion still not great) game.  If you really like the Lovecraft theme here go ahead and give it a try, otherwise it is a pretty easy pass.

We never got around to playing Star Realms, but the art and theme for this was more appealing to me anyway. It was a little longer than we would have expected, even with just two, but most of that had to do with us learning the icons and how we could chain the cards- once we got that more comfortably down, the end state was much quicker.

The current iteration of this game is seriously broken. It's playable, but the winner will be determined by the player that was able to acquire sanctuaries the quickest. Sanctuaries and nexuses are currently over powered in my opinion. I would like to see more cards with the location destruction ability to balance the game. Hopefully such cards will be added to the game in future expansions. This could be a very fun game to play.

Buy this game! Now! Seriously, the value you get is amazing.

This game packs a serious punch. 'Only' 66 cards, but cards have multiple uses depending on what strategy you go for.

In Star Realms you have to specialize in 1-2 factions, here you will often find off-factions card that work really well with your deck.

It's a fast deckbuilder, there are many ways to trash or cycle cards so you get a pretty strong engine in a small amount of turns.

The game explodes in the end-game where, with a good engine, you can easily output 10-20 damage per turn, enabling impressive comebacks.

I have yet to try the physical version, but it is not as good as Star Realms. The extra trade in the starting deck makes the first shuffle much more luck based. The cards provide a bit of every resource making card evaluation a mess of grey. The good cards are much worse and the bad cards are almost none existent (there are no 1 cost cards and few 2 cost). Overall, the game feels bland and not as strategic.

Cthulhu Realms is a rethemed version of Star Realms that has a few tweaks and changes. Two of the most notable are that there are fewer colors of cards and support for multiple players from the outset. The game seems a little less likely to have such wild combos as the original.

Overall, I prefer a space theme over a Cthulhu theme. The iconography takes a little bit of getting used to. The changes to the game play don't really change the feel of the game that much. This didn't wow me that much.

[b]What [thing=179303][/thing] is and how it is played:[/b]
[thing=179303][/thing] is a deck building that comes in a small box, which is a "thing" lately (with [thing=147020][/thing], [thing=168679][/thing], [thing=150999][/thing], etc).

[thing=179303][/thing] uses mechanics akin to those of [thing=69789][/thing], [thing=129437][/thing] and, of course [thing=147020][/thing], to the point that, if you know how to play [thing=147020][/thing], you are 90% ready to play [thing=179303][/thing]. Basically the deal is this: each player uses influence (money) do recruit people and monsters and to get locations, and uses them to defend, heal, get more influence and/or attack the other opponents (lowering their Sanity value). Creatures are cards that you use and then discards; locations, once you put them on the table, they stay there for use in later turns - they can be attacked by your opponents, so that you lose the constant benefit of them (but this, of course, protects your Sanity value, since the attack is mostly used against the location).

The cards avaialble for purchase stay in a track in the middle of the table, and after one or more of them are bought, new ones come from the main deck - it is the same as what happens in [thing=69789][/thing], in [thing=125678][/thing] and in [thing=129437][/thing], and has the same issue of all of those: you may have a high value of trade in your turn and not a pretty good card to buy (though, from what I saw, most of the cards are, at least, useful, but there might not be an excellent card that fits into what you really want to get accordingly to your strategy in the game), and you buy one or other just because, and then an awesome card shows up for your opponent to take. The biggest advantage of this way of dealing with the cards is that the set up is a breeze (just shuffle everything and you are good to go), and also you have, prior to playing, less explanation to do (you just have to look and explain those five that showed up - but you do will have to lose time reading the effects of new cards most of the time).

In a similar way to what happens in [thing=147020][/thing], [thing=179303][/thing] makes cards from the same color/faction to combine among themselves, creating lots of synergies when cards of the same faction are played in the same turn (and the locations can also help this to happen, since they stay on the table and count as a "played" card in every turn they are there), and this works great to make some cards with lower value be actually sought after for a player, since it goes with the others he already purchased earlier, which makes the "always buy the most expensive one" have way less of an effect in the gameplay decisions.

[thing=179303][/thing] kept what [thing=147020][/thing] did regarding trashing: several cards have a trash effect: you get a one time bonus, and the card goes to the box, out of your deck. Since, as expected, the trash effects are pretty good, you usually are torn between use it or keep the card for later uses. This not only works great to give the players more options, while also makes deck-thinning less important (in [thing=36218][/thing] and several others, for instance, deck-thinning is usually the best way to go, so it is nice to see a change of pace).

The purpose of the game is to make your opponents Sanity to reach zero (each player starts with 50). The winner will be the last player still with Sanity left.

[b]Some differences from [thing=147020][/thing]:[/b]
- More symbols: there are more effects and to get rid of explanatory text on the cards. It is harder to start, but it usually become easier after more plays. Still, it made us struggle a lot more to get the hang of it, which can turn players down;
- The combos can happen in colors and in other symbols, which can make some harder to accomplish (as the two don't go together);
- Goes up to 4 players: which can be good, or, well, not;
- The art went from great and realistic to nice and comedic;
- The game comes in a neat box, able to hold the cards when sleeved;
- The set up allows for the game to start going faster;
- Theme: [thing=179303][/thing] is a little more than a re-skin of [thing=147020][/thing], but theme-wise is still weak. We didn't talk about the cards themselves, I can't even remember much of names - they are just colors, value and powers to me. Yes, several thematic games can be reduced this way, but the theme shines when you see yourself drawn to decisions, situations and more so in developing a story. Neither happened to me [thing=179303][/thing]. The "cute" and comedic art don't bothered me in the least.

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]
Those that know my taste in games are aware that confrontational games for two players aren't really my thing - I don't really like to conflict directly to someone else (in a multiplayer game, this is majorly lessened because of the presence of other players, thus the "head to head" fight, even when it occurs, I don't really mind). Making [thing=179303][/thing] help in this, but can lead to its own set of issues.

What I think of [thing=179303][/thing]? Surprisingly enough, I did like it. The gameplay is agile, dynamic, the turns play fast and the synergies are interesting to pull off. A game quickly becomes is a constant of massive attacks, so the 50 Sanity points don't last much once they start to fade.

At this point I can't avaluate if the overall game tends more to the side of great plays or the side of the luck into taking the best and more unique cards, since because all different the cards come from the main deck, it is possible that one powerful card only shows up once (even if it has multiple copies of it in the deck). Also, one can invest in a faction, only to see cards for it coming in droplets. I couldn't see a way to avoid or control this (there are cards that let you scrap cards from the central row, usually one you don't want your opponent to take, and this can accelerate the main deck in order for it to spill some good cards for you, but you can't be sure of this - you can take out a great card for your opponent just to put an amazing one in its place). However, some degree of luck will always be a part of any deck builder (it's a feature, not a bug), but those that work with a central track for the purchase of cards tend to suffer more in this matter.

Anyway, I liked what I saw and what I played. I wanted to play again right after the end of the game (and [thing=179303][/thing] intends exactly this: repeated plays, since experienced players can surely have 2 or 3 matches in one hour). So, is [thing=179303][/thing] approved? Yes, but less so than [thing=147020][/thing], which is cleaner, more intuitive (with the help of text), and play faster. All of these things could be invalidated if I played [thing=179303][/thing] more times. But this isn't likely to happen, so it is what it is.

Although this is very similar to star realms this one was harder to approach for me and feels mediocre. However, if you value Cthulhu over space then the ratings might turn around. The symbolics are not very clear and require too much effort to learn, compared to star realms that was clear from the beginning. However this can be played with 3 players so it earns a few bonus points for that.

More fun than Star Realms once you get past the icons.

Like Star Realms but the games take a little longer and factions trigger other faction abilities. Very Addicting!

Best of the Realms games in 4 player free-for-all. Lots of confusing symbols but has zero language barrier because of it.

The chosen artstyle/theme of quirky Cthulhu mythos has been done to death but at least the art itself is pretty good. The symbols on the cards are also laid out very cleanly. It's a very enjoyable and untrheatening interface and I'd say this is probably the best of the Realms-games to lay upon a first time player who doesn't have that much experience with card games or thinks that MTG cards look threatening.

It's also the most random of the Realms games. You can basically buy almost any combination of cards to create some kind of combos and I think the game actually encourages and rewards weird multicolored decks.

It's the silly version of the Realms-family of games in terms of both the theme and gameplay. And I'm not saying this as a bad thing. It's just a thing of note.

A spin off of Star Realms, great deck building game, plus CTHULHU!

This is the perfect deck-building game for me because it's compact, quick, and plays up to 4 players. I really hope expansions are coming for this!

A little overly complex for a deckbuilder.  The iconography is confusing.  Loved the idea and the art is awesome but doesn't live up to expectations.

Star Realms rethemed. After one play I prefer the original.

Sometimes a bit chaotic by all the (combined) possibilities of the cards played on the table.

Works great with 2 players, but for 3/4 players I suggest more Sanity for players. 70-75 is probably ok.

Deck builder, player elimination card game that reimplements the Star Realms core system in the Cthulhu realm. Cards can be played to buy new cards, cause direct damage (sanity) to target opponent or as constants to your tableau with special passive or one off abilities. Synergies and combos by collecting cult factions (color).

After one play I thought it was OK. Star Realms probably eclipses this one since we own so many expansions for it. 

The iconography was a bit fiddly in this game but we got the hang of it by the end.

It would be interesting to see how 3 and 4 players works out but I get the feeling that it might outstay its welcome with more than 2.

Cool deck-builder, but player elimination... The icons were a bit foggy and the engine I was building in my deck never got out the gate as I was quickly eliminated... It's pretty quick so not too bad, but probably more fun if you are one of the two remaining players in a 3-4 player game or just play 2p...

I love this at first blush. Perfect packaging, great look, and just very fun gameplay. However, without expansions, it simply cannot hold a candle to its older sibling Star Realms. The multiplayer version is quite good though, and the same cannot be said about Star Realms.

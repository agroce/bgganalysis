One play with the prototype only. So this rating is more like "Vorschusslorbeeren" (premature praise), but for a prototype this looked really well, especially the graphics which got one into the mood for the game, and playing this was a hoot. I am looking forward to see how this develops.

I usually don't like games that involve freely negotiating with other players, or even persuading and threatening them.  But this one hits just the right balance between (free) negotiation and commitment (enforced by the rules).  It's also incredibly flavorful.

What a surprise!

I've bought it because I'm collecting the Master Print Series from Quined Games and I've never thought I'd love this game as I actually do!

First of all, this game doesn't suit every gaming group. It's mean from the get go! DO NOT PLAY IT with sensitive people!

This is a card game with a lot of theme, a lot of take-that that makes you feel you're really a gangster.

With the right group it shines. And it shines in a level that makes me believe the rating could rise in the next plays.

The interaction is huge and that is the reason the game takes so long! Negotiations are promoted by the cards you play, even if you want to make it on your own, the game is cleverly well design and puts you in a position where you'll need to ask for assistance to complete certain jobs, and then "magic" happens! Negotiating in this game is hilarious. Even if you're not part of the negotiation. Just watching other players proposing and making promises... and watch those promises being broken... oh man! So cool! We laughed all the time.

Again, it's mean! You have to go with the right approach! But don't get me wrong, this is a strategic game, with luck involved. But strategy takes its place!

I'm loving it, even though I have not win yet. 

Props for the designer! Tha game translates the Mafia theme in a fun/mean way.

Meanness, the game. Very well executed and highly evocative mafioso wars. Quite a simple game to teach, and wonderfully illustrated. The only downside is that it needs the right audience, that is, folks ready to jump at each other's throat without qualms. With the right group though, and with 5 players, it will shine. A bit too mean for me, but a very well designed game.

Solid thematic ties, clever combination of mechanics, great GTA-inspired art -- this is the mobster-themed game I've been looking for. The rules are easy enough to teach and the game plays fast and smooth after a few plays to help learn the iconography on the cards.

Component quality is also very strong for this simple of a game- plastic-coated money helps add to the theme without being cumbersome like most paper game currency, wooden deal chips and cool black dice with red pips round out the solid production values.

The theme is well implemented, player interaction is heavy and easy to grasp and lots of play variety makes this game a modern classic.

This is a rather hidden gem - published with a german crowd-funding plattform and not translated into english (yet). It has a genius mechanism with preassambled decks of cards - that gives this game a unique story-arc. You play four rounds - and the jobs you do as well as the rewards you can earn, raise and raise. It also gets more complex - with more possibilities. And the best part - also the cards for direct player interactions get stronger and meaner: in the beginning you are just an annoyance to your fellow mobsters - maybe you just steal a bit of money from them - but if they take revenge in a later round, what they are able to do to you is much worse ... So what started as being a small nuisance to someone grows into a full size vendetta! 

Wonderful game! Again: it needs the right group of people - specially ones, that can digest mean games - and you must create an athmosphere like on a neapoliatnian market - full of bargaining, threats and cries for mercy ... than it is just a blast to play!

Nice game and quite a bit of fun with the right crowd - a first play ran a little long for what it is and given the luck quotient. Occupies the same space as 'Nothing Personal' but I probably just prefer the latter as you have a little more control although NP also runs long so if LCN proves to run faster on subsequent plays it may edge the pother out.

Lots of 'take-that' and screwage and dice and negotiations so it's not going to be everyone's cup-of-tea, but a lot of laughs if played in the right spirit.

Only few games out there catch the theme so perfectly as La Cosa Nostra. You really feel as if you were in the shoes of Tony Soprano or Don Vito Corleone. The game flows smooth and the player interaction is one of its core elements. 

But make sure you play with buddies who do not take it too serious. Like Junta and Diplomacy this game can destroy friendships.

With the right combination of players though La Cosa Nostra is a gem I can only higly recommend.

Really fun- very fast card play. Really evokes the theme. You do feel like a gangster shaking down businesses, negotiating & attacking other gangsters, while trying to make deals and/or back-stab. Great fun, but not for folks who don't like negotiation and a bit of mean game-play, because there's a lot of it! (But in a good way). It might be the best gangster/mafia themed game I've seen (tight contest with The Godfather, & better than Nothing Personal).

Played the prototype today with the designer and one other person. I am usually not a big fan of games with a high level of player confrontation or negotiations with backstabbing, but I liked this game. 
However I suspect with 4 or 5 players there will be a lot more confrontation as with 3 players, so my rating is cautious for now.
The game is pretty thematic and all of the cards and actions make sense within in the context of the theme. The artwork is very well done and consistent.
The game also plays smoothly and quickly once everybody is familiar with rules.

I knew from the beginng that I will like it. It has everything I love in board games. Negotiation, backstabbing, beautiful artworks.. it's just a good package. But man, I absolutely adore La Cosa Nostra. We've played it with 5 players and the expansion for about 4-5 hours (it took a while explaining and we've had so much trash talking going on) and it was maybe the best gaming experience besides some epic Cosmic Encounter rounds. It's so freaking thematic and cool! One of the games I could play everyday and anytime.

Good mafia-themed games are few and far between, but this is one of the better ones. I could swear that Fantasy Flight blatantly copied the mission system here for use in Star Wars Rebellion. Much like in that game, you are assigning characters to missions to attack other players or produce more resources. There is some dice rolling and encouraged diplomacy, but it's fairly straight forward. At the same time, I think I prefer Grifters for something that feels similar but plays faster. La Cosa Nostra really feels lacking in the variety department, which is a little unfortunate. I enjoyed this though, and it's one of the better mafia-themed games I've come across.

A VERY vicious 3-5 player card game where the players take the role of mobsters and try to make the most money at the end of four rounds of hidden-action selection.

Although the competition in the game can get quite personal, there are also lots of chances for making deals with other players, which is essential if you want to pull off the biggest heists and make the most money! Still, it is worth noting that this might not be the best game to play with people who take their games too seriously or who hold a grudge.

Rating after first play. The Game Designer itself introduced us to the game. Very nice Guy. Got the game end 2014. Already excited to try it more!
Played it yesterday, with five people, almost FOUR hours! And no minute was boring! So much fun. Thanks for that game!

After few more games:

More trouble!
Don´t play this with unexperienced players or couples in crisis, if you don´t want to be part of a couple-therapy!
You can (have to) be very mean in this game. 
So, if you are a sensitive person, stay out of this business. You should like to manipulate, to threaten, to make false promises.

In simple words: enjoy to be an a..h...

Like it a lot! This is player interaction pure.

Couldve gotten a 10 for me but the early game is rather slow but ends with a quick (maybe too quick) bloody endgame with no feeling of a midgame. I might prefer a more impactful single round early game then make the 2nd round much more aggressive since the latter doesnt really feel like we were transitioning to the bloody late game.

I was lucky enough to play this little gem with the designer during a protoype session, when he brought along the game to Cologne on Board. Given that this game is still in development, I wont write a full review but a lengthy comment instead.

The theme is captured very nicely, both in terms of the visual style (reminiscient of GTA) and mechanics, with lots of potential screwage, careful planning that can go wrong, some risk taking, some limited luck and of course negotiations and fragile alliances. Some people on the other table said, overhearing us play sounds like an episode of Breaking Bad and that is not far off ... 

Every round (a total of four) you associate an action / order card with one of your gangsters of varyiing strength. Once the whole planning is done, you have to choose the order in which you execute the former, which can work out as perfectly as you planned it but can go horribly wrong as well, either out of bad luck (rarely) or because someone double-crosses you or sabotages you in some way (more often than one would wish for). Then again, doing the same to other Dons is a hella lot of fun. 

Despite a tangible lack of in-game controlled balance mechanics (leader bashing and trailing off is both very well possible), the players I played with restored the balanced and the finish was very close, for a game featuring such an liberal degree of player-guided targeting. 

I found the negotiations particularly delightful, because only a very (!) limited number are binding and many other deals a based on pure trust - but are actually based on some evil plan, revenge, vendetta or sheer meaningness more often than not. 

All in all, I found this to a very exciting mixture of action planning, negotiation (interaction) and some luck. It might be a bit too harsh and confrontational for some family/Euro-Gamers, but then again, this game might not be for them. 

My only drawback (after one play mind you, maybe it is just a wrong initial impression) is the lack of a catch-up mechanism. 

Kudso to the game designer for demoing his game at a local game group with such patience, passion and - most of all - fun.

The game really deserves a better rating, but negotiation games are totally not my cup of tea and the rating reflects my desire to play (Will play when in the right mood). 

The game offers good incentives to make deals (It is almost impossible to make money without using other players' assets), and different means to pay/ get what you want. Bribe, exchange of assets, threats, "better future relations", payment in advance or after the fact.

The theme comes through very well. Each turn was like an episode of The Sopranos. 

We played only three of the four rounds at Essen (4 players), and that took us about an hour. When the players know what they are doing, it may play faster.

awesome game of negotiation, bluffing, deception and backstabbing. This game has everything I look for in a game.
You give each of your gangsters a job to do for the round (covertly of course). Then one by one, you resolve the jobs. You can bribe opponents to not harm them and much more. Everything is permitted to screw your opponents and threat them. PHANTASTIC gameplay.
The only negative aspect is the duration. The game can be very long. We had 4 hours of play (including explanation)
Maybe with further playing this will go quicker.

Seriousily needs an English Version.  Heavily german dependent language card game. 
Very good. Not recommended with 3, game is too hard to do specific jobs/missions.  You need 4 or 5 to make this work.  5 makes this game very slow.  Sadly the game is not in English which makes running the game twice/thrice as long because everybody wants to know what card X does.  I've been able to distill it to its core components and try to focus people away from the German text as this can cause issues.   There are things that can be improved.  1 = English version.   2 = Pre-requesites should be icons, not text.  So if I need a policeman, put a policeman badge in an area (like the pistols); or if I need a politican put American eagle icon and so forth -- it will make it more language independent and easier to play.


Here's how it works.  Players aim to get the most money. 4 rounds and it works clockwise from starting player (this also moves clockwise every round).  Every round players receive a number of "mission" cards from the current round.   Playrs may also get influence cards (depends on round); then players task or assign 1 single gangster per turn to a potential business purchase, mission, job, etc.   Nobody knows what it is as its face down.  

Players can play red cards, some do special things like look at another player's mission card; others look at 2 cards, others make jobs harder, or easier to do; or can make gangsters roll more die or easier to kill.

Eventually when all players gangsters are made busy, players resolve 1 card per turn until all gangsters are resolved.

Where the meat comes in is the missions; the missions can be attacks on rival players or jobs - or quests.   The jobs sometimes need pre-requesites -- some the player may have and some the player may not have.

This is where players will need to make deals with rival players for anything, cash, cards, etc; the only exception is cards in a player's hand.

Players get 5 poker like chips to use to strike deals; but whilst the deal itself is binding, the payout split does not need to be binding.

I liked the game alot but would not play it more until a proper english version with icons is one it.

RATING: 8
The game is full of flavour.
There is so much talking, my first game has ended with very tiring success...

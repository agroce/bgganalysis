This is a very good engine/resource management game.  It is interesting to see the shift mid-game from building your operas to produce money to converting over to victory points.  My main complaint on this one is that because of the limited tile distribution, starting turn order (which is random) is too much of a factor (i.e. getting cut out of Berlin).

A heavy game with a deep mechanic. Beautiful artwork which some will find off-putting - it takes itself very seriously. I like the bidding element. I wonder who the game is aimed at: As another commenter said, opera is unlikely to appeal to many gamers, and those that are opera fans may well baulk at the factual inaccuracies. But the underlying game is really very good indeed.

Very meh.  Budget mechanic is kind of interesting, but the one catch up mechanism is pretty poor.  Limited availability of opera houses can really screw you over.

Nice mix of mechanics, and I even like the theme with them, but the game is definitely missing something.  Needs some retooling or reworking or something.  It's not quite right as it stands.

RATING: 6
Better than expected. Quite unforgiving. It takes a few rounds before you see the mechanisms clicking into place. To obtain a source of income early on is very important (like in Puerto Rico), if you do not get it (or everyone does not get it), you may be out of options later in the game. I got the impression, likely wrong, that many negative comments come from player than only had a game w/o clicking), and sometimes, even with the wrong rules. I look forward to more games.

Update: Additional playtesting could have improved the game. Game end is less exciting that it should.

Interesting game.  I made some mistakes and finished last out of the four of us, but there was enough there to make me want to try it again soon.  There appear to be a few strategies and we really didn't try out many - figuring out some others as we played the game (at a point where it was a little too late to implement them effectively).  I like the way the theme is woven into the game too.  The only issues I had were (1) that there was not enough cash in the game (and particularly not enough ones), (2) that cash is worth precisely zero at the end of the game, rendering the Maestro almost useless (except as a blocker) in the last century and (3) the rule book needs a serious, serious re-organization.

There are a number of new twists on game designs in this game, but it does not feel particularly new.  its new-ness stems almost entirely from its theme - which is quite unique in the gaming world.  The game will take an opera's time to finish (2-3 hours) and the various acts will have some repetition.  The rules are mostly clear, but one needs to watch how the characters and unique persona are slightly different.  In the end you'll have to decide if it was a tragedy or a comedy but keep in mind both have a place in opera history.

Was a little confused learning this one but it's ultimately a pretty unique theme for a game with beloved Euro mechanics like auctions and trading. Let's put it this way, if you want an economic simulation of opera I don't know how many other options you have...

This game has a very unique theme, and the mechanics, while not innovative, are well integrated.
There's an interesting role selection mechanic, with some roles giving benefit to the choosing player only, while others allow every player to perform actions (but the turn player gets first choice).
The budget mechanic is quite interesting, specially at the beginning of the game when the money is tight.
The only complaint is about the lenght: it probably would have been better if shorter (maybe 3 turns less?).
Anyway, the gameplay is nice and it scales well to two.

I like the mechanics, but I think it may be broken. There were no catch up mechanics for those who fell behind in the game that were powerful enough to even let them compete. I was the lucky won that ran out to a fast lead, but the fun dropped when my lead kept rising and no one could do anyting about it. I need to read through the poorly organized rules to make sure we didn't miss something.

I'm not sure where this one is going yet.  I have to get a second play in.  It reminds me of PR some (with the roles and such) but the way money works and how you can use the roles is different and interesting.  I fell behind somehow and it was very difficult for me to come back.  A key to the game is budgeting and working that track as sometimes you definately want to be the first one to do things.  So, for me a second play could put this into the good game category or if it falls flat it just becomes another game like this (not bad but nothing that blows me away).  Unlike some comments, I found the rules to be pretty decent and wasn't hard to get into the flow of the game.

Underrated game. Way better than I expected, after the first play with a friend's copy I decided to buy mine. The only issue is that is a little longer for what it is. But with some experience Opera may last less than 2 hours and can be more interesting because you start to know when to take some actions and when not.

I want to play Opera more!

*update*

After one bad experience in a 2 players game we had to stop, I decide to trade it away because I realized that I need better games my collection than maintain this one.

Amanda.  Hope to get several more plays of this.  The game is brilliant.  You commit to converting cash in order to do actions or on holding cash to use the actions you activate.  There's also a time when you've got enough cash and you need to switch to getting VPs.  Has the feel of a Wallace game.  Not sure about long term replayability but short term it's very cool.

Juego de prestigio a la ora de producir eventos operísticos. Incluye una fase de subasta que determina el presupuesto de las obras (que se usa para seleccionar roles) y el orden de juego. Además, el orden de juego es variable (va cambiando según las acciones de los jugadores). Hay que construir teatros (con distintos números de salgas) donde realizar las operas. Estas se valoran más o menos según el presitigio de los autores, que va cambiando en cada turno. 

Es un juego interesante... y me apetece volver a jugarlo.

RATING: 6.5
The gist of this game is that players are wealthy aristocrats trying to gain prestige in Europe by building opera houses and commissioning operas. There are a number of cities in which players can build opera houses, and there are a number of composers each player can commission. The value of each composer and the price per commission varies and changes over the course of the game, similar to a stock market. Players can perform a variety of actions, including stealing others' operas or inflating the value of their own, but actions cost money and the number of actions each player can do is limited by the player's budget. Although operas make money for the players, the goal of the game is prestige points and the money goes only toward the budget. 

I really loved the game's theme and thus wanted to love the game itself, but it has a number of issues. Because each player's budget has a rather low maximum limit compared to the cost of the actions, I felt like I could never perform enough actions each turn. Some elements of the game involve pretty hardcore backstabbing, which might not be to everyone's taste but could add some drama. And the game's rules are fairly complicated; I frequently had to refer to the rules each turn to remind myself what needed to be done and how.

Based on one incomplete game at Essen 2009.

A seemingly decent euro. A bit of planning and budgeting and efficiency. Not too terribly interactive and will feel like multi player solitaire.

Will need to replay to re-assess rating.

Update Aug 2012: After 3 years, played a full game. It's decent. The economics are very tight in the first few rounds.

Update Jan 2014: Broken economics and runaway leader problem. Will not play this again.

Final rating 7 -> 4

RATING: 6
Opera is a game I'd been looking forward to for a long time - indeed, it was my pre-Essen pick of the fest.  Mostly this was due to the theme, which is unique (and super dry, like my favorite Euros tend to be), and the vaguely Wallace-esque element of some of the design (two or three mechanisms that interlock in subtle ways, the budget process).  

Now that I've played it a few times, I'd say the game is good.  Not amazing, but a solid, subtle Euro.  It doesn't have bells or whistles, and it will be interesting to see if it has legs, but for now it works.  The budget mechanism is very interesting, but probably of less importance in the 2er.  I'd say timing is the number one element to success in this game - if you have an opponent who is equally adept, it is a tense, fun battle.  If not, though, it can be a bit of a blow out, as getting back into it can be hard.  Not impossible, but involves extra attention to sequencing and smart use of the Esperato.  Ignoring key use of the Critic and Esperato will pretty much doom anyone, but it is not obvious on the first few plays what to do and how to grab points beyond the scoring rounds.  If you are only scoring during the scoring rounds, you will lose.

So, overall, I'd say it scales very well and is fun if the theme and mechanics are of interest.  I am not quite as excited about it as I'd hoped to be, but certainly not disappointed.  Good for two, better with more (I would imagine).  Very beautiful game, too.

Rather good - and worth rating up a notch or two if it plays a bit faster on subsequent plays - though all the best operas have a stately progress, so I guess we shouldn't be surprised.

RATING: N/A
I quite liked this from a mechanical point of view, although the endgame balances felt a little bit off in our first game - too much money chasing not enough scores. Not sure if it was just our suboptimal play, though, it takes a bit to get a handle on the game.

It's definitely a pieces-parts game, feels like bits from Puerto Rico, Age of Steam, and others. Definitely a meaty game, it felt pretty strong, but also a little nervous about the balance as this sort of thing is hard to get right and the designer is relatively new to this sort of thing.

The English rules are not great, although I've seen far worse. It takes attention and some close reading to get everything right - fortunately it's just not that complicated - and some additional player aids would have been extremely helpful (full sequence of play, and a track for keeping track of how many operas from each composer are out there).

Better than I thought, given what I heard. BUT... the game is 50% longer than it should be. The game is played in thirds, and in our one game, it felt like the game was done by the end of the second third, with the game basically just playing out in the last third, with very few interesting decisions left. If I owned a copy, I would simply define the game to last two of the periods, or whatever they call it. Nice little roll selection with stock market (value of composers), with being able to piggy-back on other people's actions.

RATING: 5
I consider this game to be Hans van Tol's best to date. Previous designs were aways a bit off for various reasons, but in Opera he did his best and polished the mechanisms smooth and seamless. At the core, Opera is a simple snowball engine against a backdrop of opera: bascially convert money into operas into points. Special characters come to the aid of the players—at a price, of course. The cute gimmick is the way money is used: you have budget, and cash. Budget is used to hire characters and determines player order, but is in limited supply. Cash is only of use to the person hiring a character first: the other players can have a sort of 'guest use', but must pay with budget instead.

Against Opera pleads undoubtedly the very simple growth engine which has been mauled at specific points to prevent runaway strategies from ruining the experience. This is not a good sign, as it makes the game play itself somewhat repetitive in the long term. (In addition, some other geek mentioned that once you amass enough money, it is easy to bid the maximum amount as to keep your options open. That is a very interesting point which, if true, would severely damage this game.) Still, that keeps the game simple enough for me to understand it, although at this point I'm not sure whether player contention can create a situation where you fall behind in the first rounds and are never able to catch up. As a consequence I'm hovering between a 5 and a 6 for now.

Captivating with little downtime. However, nothing really new and the first turns are crucial and may lead to players being hopelessly left behind. The game has borrowed a lot from Puerto Rico.

An economic game with an opera theme. Hire composers and music halls around Europe to perform operas at 3 different times in the game (scoring rounds). Interesting budget phase that both determines turn order (which adjusts as players spend the money they budgeted) and how much money players have to spend on roles for that round. Roles can be chosen by the current start player and "played along" by other players. Three of the roles benefit the choosing player only and cannot be played along. 

Interesting tradeoff in that money is earned every round, but scoring only happens every third round. Some shuffling of composers around the music halls takes place, as you earn more money by having large music halls full of composers, but you earn more points by having your composers (each with a different, fluctuating fame value based on player decisions) in separate music halls (different cities). 

It's a bit dry, but fun to play once in a while. Money can be very tight. You have to be willing to sell compositions to the Palazzo (even though you need composers in your opera houses to score VPs)!

RATING: 7.5
Very nice.

It reminds a bit of Puerto Rico (where other players get to share the active player's role). It has a dual-currency somewhat like Vinhos's Bank/Cash (but here it's Budget/Cash). Some things are purchased from Budget, others from Cash.

There's a hint of stock market action where you can increase or decrease the current fame of certain composers. (If you have a lot of Mozart, use the Critico to raise his fame. If an opponent has a lot of Wagner, lower Wagner's fame with the Critico.)

The theme is different, at least, though I'm no opera fan. (I actually felt a lot more like I was managing Classical symphonies rather than operas--which fits my tastes much better. The theme is definitely not pasted on, but since you're never recruiting tenors or sopranos or dealing with any sort of specifically operatic narrative... a symphony theme works just as well.) 

The rulebook was a challenge due to some confusing/ambiguous translations, but once we got going we found a really nice and innovative game.

In short, really liking it after a first play and expecting it will take several more plays to get past the first layer of this one. Good find!

UPDATE: My wife feels like this one is take-it-or-leave-it, so since we only play it with just the two of us... I'm getting rid of it in favor of playing our favorites more often.

A middleweight role-selectin', economic-engine-buildin' game. There are a number of moving parts, each of which is simple and easy to understand. The relationships between them make the game interesting.

I appreciate this game for its theme - building opera houses, filling them with works from classical composers (but no Mozart??), and watching critics influence the popularity of the tunes.   Pretty original concept for a boardgame.  Mechanically, however, the game is anything but original.  The action track is borrowed from Thebes/Tinner's Trail, the role selection is like Peurto Rico, and the list goes on.   Everything is too tightly constrained for my tastes.   Shortages are designed into the system, which isn't necessarily clever, and recovery from a poor start doesn't seem very possible.   Since the game is very long, that means you are stuck in the grind until it ends.   I think there's room for a good game with a classical music theme, but this one falls short for me.

A great eurogame of medium weight with beautiful artwork and pretty streamlined gameplay. The only problem is to grasp the difference between you money and your budget - as soon as you get it the game flows.

An income generation vs acquiring victory point type game.  Early on you need to generate money but at some point you need to stop and focus on victory points as that is how you win.  Knowing when to stop focusing on one and transitioning to the other is key.

Has a Puerto Rico Job role mechanic at its heart (primary job owner gets an advantage though others may, usually, due the job also) though souped up by players allocating money to a "budget" that determines order of players being able to pick specific job roles.

This was a fairly fun game though not ground breaking.

My one play of this was hindered by several factors: We were learning as we were playing, it was late at night, and we were interrupted several times.

RATING: 7
This one is difficult to comment on:  It starts slowly with money being very scarce and the main focus on getting more cash.  Around turn 5 or 6 (from 9 turns) the game focus shifts from money to victory points.  Resource and especially turn order management is highly critical and the game is very unforgiving.  Initial rating is 7 after one play, may go up if replay value is good, may go down if the "screwed you" factor turns out to be too big.

Underrated, under-the-radar game. Elegant blend of familiar mechanics leads to some unique gameplay and elastic tactical/timing decisions. Reminded me somehow of Martin Wallace's "Automobile."

One play, which we abandoned once we realised that it wasn't leading anywhere. Very strange game. We'll try it once more to make sure we've got all rules correct, but unless we missed something this might be the worst game I've bought in a very long time.

RATING: 5
Very dry and probably too long for the decisions and fun it provides.  You bid for the exciting prospect of taking an action that benefits everyone else too.  Occasionally there will be a turn where going first on soemthing is huge; it is on those turns when you will wish you had paid more attention to the turn order, or when luck will have screwed you out of going first or whatever.  

It has a couple neat mechanics, it combines a basic stock market with action drafting and bidding for turn order.  None of it really blows you away and a lot of the rules seem pointless and like they add nothing.  Why am I moving a token around to represent the critic?  The whole thing could have been stripped down a little further and made into a shorter game.  At a shorter play time, I might have found it exciting enough to want to play again.

Very slow and thinky but fun. Every action matters a *lot* and there's no real catch-up mechanism (person in last might get a few bonuses but only from one specific role) so expect to spend a lot of time playing. Definitely not for everyone but good for the right group.

I think I'd enjoy this more the second time through. The first time was kind of rough around the edges as the rules are often unclear, and it was not the best choice for the end of a meaty game night. This could go up to a 7 if I enjoy it more at some point, but I suspect that's the best it can do.

I wish that this one had a little more variability to it, or a few more paths to success, or even six composers known for their operas! (We always laugh about Beethoven, the famous operatic composer ;-)

But while the money interactions and budgeting choices are interesting, they're not utterly fascinating, and the fact that you deal with generic compositions by known composers as opposed to actual compositions (Fidelio, and um-uh ...) limits some of the theme of being an operatic impresario, or a family of them.

Not a bad game at all, but not a terrific one either. Shame.

Somehow I always miss the point where you have to switch from making money to VP gaining. this is the most improtant point in the game and somehow it always zooms past me. the theme is thin but interesting enough and the turn order track is one of the most innovative features.

Money is very tight early but it is easy to end with far too much.  I'm looking to play through it a few more times to see if more of this cash can be forgoed for victory points, or if it is just an inevitable by-product of earning points.

Total surprise.

I'm truly delighted how great the mechanisms of the game mesh up together and how tough and complex the choices are.
Despite the similar general flow of the game (at the beginning the money is the most important; later on you have to switch - wisely! - to VP acquring), every game is very different in many details and in many single decisions.

The theme is great.
The budget track is an ingenious invention.
The game is FUN to play.

What else would you require?

It is a perfect example how the modern eurogames should be designed - without feeling 'samey', 'been there, done that' and boring recycling of exploited themes and mechanisms...

Ridiculously underrated game.  Possibly THE MOST underrated game here, on bgg.

I like the game. Partly because I like classical music, but the most enjoyment comes from the overall game-flow. Decide when and which buildings you buy, which operas you then want to invest in and perform, decide on your budget for all expenses and at the same time try to get some victory points! All this is intertwined in a beautifuly presented eurogame.

UPDATE after first play:
Fulfilled my expectations! You start low, slowly building up, in the second Season you start generating more money and already can think about using Esperto for Victory Points and in the third Season it is all about maximizing your Victory point count as much as possible. I want to play more!

RATING: 8
Very tentative rating based on just three plays thus far.  After going through one 2009 disappointing Essen game after another in recent months (notable disappointments for me included Carson City, Hansa Teutonica and Tobago), this game appealed to me.  It has a very attractive theme not often seen (Traumfabrik and Show Manager are the closest), and the interlocking role mechanisms make it a very challenging game with interesting choices just about every turn.  Only negatives are (1) playing time thus far has seemed a bit long and (2) initially, it does appear very difficult to catch up if you fall behind in the early going.  Thus, the rating could possibly drop to a 7 or even lower after more plays but for right now, it's probably #3 on my list of the most interesting new releases from 2009 (trailing Automobile and Homesteaders, neither of which was an Essen release, I might point out).

RATING: 7
Puerto Rice set to music.

Not really but the game does revolve around roles like Puerto Rico, but does it in it's own unique way.

You need to split your income between budget (which pays for the roles) and cash in hand which you use when you buy things. Lots of different ways to score points make it an interesting game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
On its surface there is nothing really new here, but the designer has all the elements interacting very tightly.  Players buy opera houses and pieces to perform in them.  On the one hand, you want to build big houses to pay big income; on the other you have to manage which composers you support because their value will fluctuate.  In many ways, this is a market game of buying "shares" in composers with the goal of investing in the best ones.

RATING: 5
While I enjoyed Antwerpen from the same publisher due to its simplicity, Opera is the incarnation of the opposite design school of refining and complicating games. It has a few things going for it such as being an unforgiving game in the beginning. Careful advance planning on your intended actions is necessary in allocating the budget the first few rounds or you will fall behind without a chance to catch up if you end up short. Opera avoids the arbitrariness of only seemingly meaningful decisions that enough other games fall prey to. On the other hand towards the end the game gets repetitive and outstays its welcome. Not the story arc you wish for. A game with so many elements needs more development work and ability than had been present. Opera comes close to goodness but doesn't reach it. Not an annoying game but plain average in the sense of the BGG rating system.

An interesting game with a lot of interactions between the various aspects (personnel, location and budget) and I'm not sure what I think of it yet.  It seemed okay, but it also didn't super grab me.  I'll give it another shot and maybe revise this to a 7.  I don't think it will be any higher to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting theme and brilliant production that also gives you information on the history of opera. However, the game is somewhat dry, boring and not so much fun. The role selection mechanism borrows heavily from Puerto Rico, as the Signora resembles the Trader, the Architetto resembles naturally the Builder and the Impresario combines the Settler and the Mayor. Money seems to be really scarce in the early game and not restricted anyhow in the end game. What bothers me the most is the player having the most money can maintain biggest budget and therefore gets to build and recruit composers before others who will also have to pay heavily extra to follow these actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
You build opera houses and commission works by noted composers to showcase in the performance halls of these houses. That is basically the gist of the game. There is a nifty economic engine which can be craftily managed. The components and art work sing, but the theme runs a bit thin. Also, the game's arc seems to hit a peak about 2/3 of the way through, then just lingers through the final rounds. Nonetheless,  like many games, Opera is a fun experience when you're playing with a good group.

I don't know why I like this game. There's absolutely nothing new here. I usually skip games without new mechanics, and especially games that just take a bunch of known mechanics and mesh them all together.

But for some reason, I really liked this one. It's clean, and it's full of tension. The decisions are quite delicious. Maybe it's the beautiful art.

This is what I hate about the average score system.

Dropped to a shabby 8.76 with 17 ratings.

Designer removed his rating which I really appreciate.

Three users who rate it a ten look the same one to me. 
One dutch user who rates Trivial Pursuit a nine rates this a ten.
So ten rating doesn't tell me much.

HOWEVER
Upon a quick read of the rules the game looks interesting though. And the production value looks great.

Will wait until after Essen. Hope noone is fooled by the high average score and the game lives up to its promise.

RATING: 9
NOT what I expected. Bought this game entirely for theme and design. Was prepared to be disappointed and kept my expectations low... What a surprise to have them completely over exceeded. This is a mathematical game of multiple spending accounts. It's a role choice game but the rub is that the person that chooses the role is the one that doesn't (necessarily) have the better deal, unlike Puerto Rico where the chooser gets a bonus. It can breed a lot of analysis paralysis, so be cautious of who you choose to play it with your first few tries.

Played once, 4 players.  A horrible explanation, the lateness of our game (midnight at bgg.con), and a difficult rulebook to read on the fly didn't totally kill my interest in this game.  I like what I saw, and I think there's plenty of interesting mechanisms here for at least another game.

RATING: 5
I'm uncertain as to how I feel about this game yet.  It is very derivative of other games (IE, Puerto Rico role selection, Thebish type "turn taking", etc).  The mix of budget vs money was interesting as one had to figure out how important it was to either follow or pick roles versus money to actually buy the items.  Early game one is starved for money but by the late game the money is flowing in for the most part and the action centers more around timing role selection.  I'm also uncertain as to how balanced the roles are - some won't be used early, some won't be used late.  One aspect I do appreciate in the role selection is that half of the characters must move to a city to do an action there - and only players who are involved in that city may follow that action.  Most cities only have 1-2 spaces so one must be careful to time selection and placement of the special characters.

I first played this at BGG.Con 2009, with an initial rating of 7.

It's a nicely crafted game, and while it owes an homage to Puerto Rico in a lot of its design elements, in execution it's quite different (as one might expect).

Money is tight in the early game and looser in the latter half of the game, but VP are always the key. Eyes on the prize...

Shares features with Neuland/Tinner's Trail, Traumfabrik, and Puerto Rico.

The AP mechanism is Neuland/Tinners. Blind Bids turn into an equal amount of budget for the round. These are your AP's. Whomever has spent the least (top and left most) goes next).

There is set collection like Traum where you build sets of composers, though no duplicate composers are allowed. There are multiple ways to score them, either combined or individually, and even a few ways to make extra cash from them. The interesting thing about the tableaus the composer tiles are placed on is that they are expandable, and this expansion is another way to get VP's.

The major mechanism for action spending is through role selection and other players can "play along"; though they have to buy in unlike Puerto.

Solid game. Could really grow on me and my group.

Further play lowers this one to a 6. The main reason is the wild swings in possible vp values in the composer market. I also think the the actions and opera houses force too much overlap and interconnection to the point where you could unintentionally or intentionally affect other players, perhaps all 3 of your opponents simultaneously. It leads to a "I don't want to do that action" syndrome that takes away quite a bit of the game for me.

I'm also not happy with how long it plays, or at least how long it feels like it's taking.

One of those titles I come into with low expectations and come away with a pleasant surprise. The rulebook can be hard to follow in places. This is mainly due to the translation into English. The game starts out a bit slow but begins to pick up steam soon after. Then it's a battle for turn order and getting those resources you need. This turned out to be a fun experience with some interesting and tense moments.

Opera is a balanced, interesting and lavishingly produced game that, nevertheless, I’m never going to play again. This paradoxical statement is obviously influenced by a rather large cupboard full of games that are similar and, crucially, just a little bit more appealing than Opera. To a large extent, this is due to them being first - if a game with a nice quandary of when to switch from making money to generating victory points and a very neatly done action selection had been published in 2002, it would have been sensationally good.

As things in 2010 stand, small improvements and variations on the plethora of games already inhabiting the 90min Euro niche are not enough by themselves, so you’d better come up with a fresh and engaging theme for your game. Opera obviously scores regarding the originality of its theme, but this is a mixed blessing for two reasons. Gripping boardgame themes tend to revolve around our childhood fantasies (pirates, soldiers, astronauts, toy trains and ghost stories), and we are willing to overlook the weaknesses of an otherwise mediocre game for a revisit of those. My guess is that the number of kids captivated by the opera (or classical music in general) is comparatively small. Small enough for all of them to run operas in real life, possibly ...

The more quaint and specialized a theme is, the better it should be implemented within a game, lest the few errant souls who get attracted by something out of the ordinary are disappointed. And this is the fatal flaw of Opera: including Beethoven and Bach among the six composers in Opera is about as sensible and historically true as Viking mercenaries and pygmy tribes with blowguns in the Thirty Years War.

Accordingly, the target market for Opera consists of people who are willing to extend 90+ minutes on a boardgame, but possess less than a dozen other games and/or people who like the opera, but don’t know the least bit about it.

First impression is that this is a very good and deep strategy game. Role selection has been done before, but this is a quality game in the genre. Besides, the budget allocation adds something fresh and really makes you plan ahead. 

Second impression is that one or two mistakes in the beginning could very well cost you the game. I made some mistakes in the first two turns and the other players made some cash while I couldn't. After this, I was unable to turn the game around because I lacked the budget to gain the upper hand. I don't agree with the people saying this game's got a runaway leader problem, but the game is very, very unforgiving if you fail to earn some money in the first few turns.

I do not like Operas for the most part.  Frankly, opera is for those who like to listen to fat people stand around and shout at each other in Italian.  However, there are a couple of operas I can tolerate - Doctor Atomic being one of them.  Anyway, must have (actually I now have it) this one as it will appeal to my classically trained and professional musician wife.

"Falling for theme" is the common thread you'll find among this list of previously owned games, and there's no game's theme I fell harder for than this.  From the moment I started reading about it, the gameplay, artwork or mechanics mattered not to me.  It was about classical music, or so I managed to delude myself into believing, and that was that.  So what happended?  Well, I WAY overspent for the game, broke out the rules (which are pretty badly written) and realized...this is just another dry, lifeless Euro!  On top of all that, there is a rather unintuitive strategy of gathering lots of money in the beginning, and completely abandoning it at the end, that felt contrived and strange.  Perhaps I was a bit hasty with my opinion, but it felt so clunky and uninspired (so much the opposite of opera, in my opinion), that I was almost compelled to rid my collection of it.  A great disappointment, sorry to say.

Fun game with a very unusual theme--although it doesn't necessarily impact play all that much. There are specific composers, but not specific compositions.

If only this game were as grand as its subject. Missed an opportunity by not including the 20th century: Puccini and Britten would have been excellent choices.

First impression (3 players): The game feels pretty good and gets some mental bonus points for having uncommon theme. Many things are done right in the game but there are couple of big issues. For me personally the biggest minuses are "chicken" race for better position on the next round that can be a bit too crucial at some times. Also money/points gathered from Maestro/Esperto are pretty big part and you have perhaps too little control over it (esp. in 4 player game). These things add much length to the game and variant that makes game only 7 rounds short on the other hand makes Esperto movement even more valuable...

The game might have 2 against 1 problem with Esperto scorings if played with 3 players. Not really sure if the fourth player will correct this problem but next time play I would like to try with 4.

Glorious, glorious wallowy theme and art, and that's almost enough to lose yourself in the game as it stands. Beneath it is a tight little economic exercise, far more restrictive and nasty than Power Grid - the nearest comparison, despite the outward resemblances to Puerto Rico. Paralysis dissipates quickly as you learn to play. It's a real shame that the rulebook was so poorly written and/or translated: there's a really cute game here crying out for better access.

Enjoyable. Tight budget, particularly in the early game make it a fine balancing act between monsy and points. Have only played 2 player so far but am keen to increase the load.

Load increased - but will only play this 2 player in future. With more players it suffers if a player falls behind early game. If you drop off the pace, you wont get back on it again. Some have complained about a runaway leader problem, but that's not my experience of this.

An okay game that does not really do much new or different.  It seems to have a runaway leader problem in the beginning as the person with the most money gets a nice head start.  A little after the halfway point money becomes too easy for everyone to get.  The role that allows a score of a city seems too strong.  It seems that there should be a scoring every round.  Would be willing to give it another try.

A steady if unexciting Euro affair. There are little races, taking Puerto Rico style actions, to buy opera halls and musicians giving you first call on which of this limited stuff you'll get. You can sell musicians off for either more money (first half of game) or VPs (second half). There's a choice on whether to consolidate in one city (increases your income, enables you to take advantage of the VPs-from-one-city action) versus spreading out across many cities (which limits the above, but will score more points in each of the 3 scoring rounds). Nice components, decent decisions to make without being overwhelming ... steady.

Very good theme and well crafted mechanisms. Unfortunetly they dont support the theme imho. And "well crafted" is not enough these days, Im afraid. There are so many better games, while Opera fails to stand out of the crowd. 5 years ago it would have been a milestone. Today its just "well crafted".
Too bad.

This is one of the four EuropeMasters games 2010. Unfortunately after competing in EuropeMasters you are fed up with theese games. 

This is a game that looses every time you play it. Last time I played (which probably will be the last time ever) I started poorly, and had no chance of ever getting back on my own. Everyone else took turns keeping me behind. In addition to that i lost big time, the others all were quite boring, rude and irritating. That ruined the game for me for ever.

Based on one play: Nothing new here, pick a role and then others can use the role as well, all in the attempt to build your opera and get artists to play there. It also seems that the character who choses the action, although gets first choice, has to pay more, so it is often better to stay in second in the order track and use others choices.

Well, there's nothing wrong in particular with Opera, but the game feels something like dry. The theme is excellent, but gameplay doesn't support it. Opera is an ok game, but feels like I've seen all it offers before - except the theme. Six points for the game itself and one for the theme.

It's a solid game. The budget track turn mechanic combines with the role selection mechanic to create a unique experience, especially when there are some roles where others can play along while in some roles they cannot. The pieces are very nice.

Bidding and set collection game with a nice theme, you're trying to prepare the best opera house in major cities of Vienna, Venice, Berlin etc. and trying to get the best musicians to perform at your opera. You get points and fame for only the main musician in every opera house but if you want to maximise your income you need a big opera with lots of different performers. Good game, my first play seemed a bit weird, as well all struggled with income in first half of the game and had too much money in second half. Also, not a big fan of catchup mechanic where you send your best musician to the weakest players opera house.

A nice strategy/economy game with an unsual theme. Instead of goods or stocks, people buy pieces of music and raise or lower the worth (fame) of composers. The best thing about Opera is the budget system which determines the turn order and thus the roles played by each player. While this might look like a small part of the game it is essentially the heart of the game and what makes it stand out from the crowd. For my taste, the game requires too much planning ahead and once you are behind there is a slim chance you can catch up. It is purely skill/strategy based. A few more luck/random factors could have done the game good. Still, the theme and interesting turn order resolution make this a one worth checking out.

RATING: 7
Players build Opera Houses and purchase music, following certain guidelines while attempting to fill their halls for maximum victory points. Money is critical but very limited, particularly early in the game. Rounds of blind "budgeting" determine your budget each round, as well as how much money you have left to complete the actions chosen and the round's turn order. There is then character selection to perform actions, but by choosing a character you open up the possibility for an opponent to use that character's secondary ability at a lower cost. A heavy game with difficult decisions and tradeoffs (e.g. number of houses to build vs. the quantity of halls in each). Unfortunately the English rules that ship with the game are unusable.

Very thematic game with ingredients from Puerto Rico and very clever budget system ála Martin Wallace. The foremost concern before the game was that it has nine rounds where you do exactly the same thing. After the first game that worry can be put aside. Nine rounds doesn't feel too much but the game takes quite long to grasp and play through the first time it is played. Also it can be quite easy to fall behind with the money in the two first rounds and the rest of the game you are just trying to catch up. All in all a fine game which has fine mechanics and superb theme.

Only played it with two players which doesn't seem to be the best format. It doesn't add anything original. The artwork is beautiful and the components are excellent. Everything seems to work pretty well despite its lack of originality.

Played it again this time with 3 players. Boring game with a pasted theme. We felt that the game could have ended after the second scoring because we didn't have any more buildings to buy and we simply had but a few actions to choose. The income was so ridiculously huge that all three players achieved budget 10 and only 3 or 4 actions could really add something to game play. In the end I have the feeling that this game doesn't work at all. 

The rulebook is atrocious and the player aids in both characters and screens are ridiculous.

(mostly played the allegretto version used at the 2010 European boardgame championships)
Very tense opening situation reminding me of a game of "chicken". Technically, all players should bid 10 to have a chance to be at the top of the initiative track. But if everybody does, this leaves player number four in a bad position with almost no money.
On the other hand, player number 1 is quite fine with one other player bidding 10, but not with two or three other players bidding 10.
Anyway, this first turn has a big impact on the rest of the game.
A friend of mine summed it up as:
"This game has a blind-bidding-runaway-leader problem".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
The game is a role section game similar to Puerto Rico with a feeling of Caylus.  The unique mechanic is the calculation of a budget each turn and being rewarding for spending your money perfectly.  This mechanic of being awarded more money by guessing what your opponent will choose to do, for me, is uninteresting and is not enough to get by a theme that bores me.  Theme is very important to my gaming experience and Opera is not a theme that grabs me.  Do not get me wrong the game is well thought out and the mechanics mesh into a decent gaming experience.  I will play the game if it is suggested but it is just a game that is not for me.

RATING: 8
The first play was hampered by me being slow to get the difference between income & VP requirements straight in my head, but the late rounds felt more organised (albeit doomed). An interesting blend of mechanisms. Blind bidding for turn order (but also action points), next to act dictated by remaining AP, role selection with benefits for other players, a need to balance income & VP generation. Great artwork & chunky tiles. Interesting theme. It all seemed to fit together nicely.

RATING: 8
Worker placement Euro with an unusual theme. Players take the role of opera promoters and attempt to build opera houses across Europe in which to stage performances by famous composers. The worker roles bring benefits such as an architect to build new houses, a critic to increase or decrease the popularity of certain composers, an impresario to purchase new operatic pieces etc. Balancing the different roles and attempting to earn finances in order to fund your developments is key to the game and I particularly like the mechanic for acquiring your budget, which also doubles as a means for determining player order. There's loads of strategy involved and combined with the original theme and excellent visual look of the game, this is a very fine example of its genre.

There's nothing new here that you won't have seen before, but it's a solidly put together game with a few flaws.

It unfortunately is a fairly generic money/VP engine game where you spend some of the game putting together your money engine and then choose when to switch over to a VP engine. This generic set of mechanisms overshadows what is otherwise a nice theme and a very pretty board with solidly made pieces.

I think if this was one of my first games, I'd have fallen in love with it, but having seen this too many times before, it's a little underwhelming.

The rule book also has a few oversights which we needed clarifying.

There's a lot going on here, and I suspect it will take several more plays before the full depth of the game is apparent. That's the good news. Bad news is that the theme is awful and Opera seems terribly unforgiving ... get into a hole early and it's going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to claw your way out. On top of that, I have some real concerns that this game may have rich-get-richer syndrome. Initial rating of 6, but I'm looking forward to a few more plays to see where this one settles in.

In 1607 Monteverdi’s Opera La Favola d’Orfeo had its worldwide premiere. Over the following centuries, Europe was taken over. In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers Händel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.

Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.

In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.

RATING: 5
You have a lot of choices starting with a budget for each round (up to 10). The player with the highest budget goes first. This allows them to choose a role first and often buy the cheap stuff first. Others can also us that role so if you do not budget well, you can get left behind. Play the first game as a learning experience and you should be good. I would play this again if anyone asked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not as heavy or complicated as I'd expected from a rules read-through. After a couple of rounds it became more apparent what I should be doing (and what mistakes I'd made in the first round!). This has some of the same elements as Puerto Rico, namely the role selection and the method of trading goods for money, only here the goods are various composers' operas rather than Caribbean crops. Instead of shipping commodities for VPs, in Opera you display them in your theatres and manipulate their values so that yours are worth the most at the right time. That aspect of the game is similar to Arkadia or Reef Encounter. I found it to be a bit fiddly in two respects: the way money is split into cash in hand and budget and the related system of turn order tracking. The theme didn't draw me in, but at least it's something original.

Glad to finally play it. Its a commodity game in disguise. Buy composers when they are cheap; bump up their price using roles or group-think a certain composer will do well and sell it for cash / victory points or try to hold stock in the best composer in the 3 main scoring phases in the game.

To do this you need Opera Halls and fill your number 1 main hall with a composer so that it reaps benefits of the 3 main scoring phases; but you can also fill other spots as each missing space can cost you cash.

Cash in this game is very tight if you don't invest it properly or spend it (like I did) on VP too early.

There is no real catch up mechanic if you fall down of cash; you end up having to pass so you can earn enough revenue to compete with the big boys in the next round -- and then repeating the cycle as you have no cash; effectively taking you out of the game.

There are roles, 3 of which can be followed (a bit like Pueto Rico) and 3 others which cannot be followed.

Using money on the budget track is key; spend too much and you'll end up lacking cash -- spend too little you'll end up losing pace to the others.

Its a reasonably good game, but disverification and stock holding with commodity speculation is the name of the game; regardless of the theme.

Европейская игра типа Puerto Rico, Cuba, Race for the Galaxy и т.п. Мне очень понравилась, считаю её на голову выше и интересней перечисленных (кроме Race for the Galaxy - которая мне не особо нравится из-за излишней гикнутости, но явно более успешная). 

Суть игры заключается в использовании персонажей, 3 из которых действуют по типу перонажей из Пуэро Рико - т.е. их задействуют все игроки (причём выбравший с минусом), а 3 персонажа приносят выгоду только выбравшему, но их активация стоит дорого и выгодна не всегда с очевидностью.

Мы строим оперы в городах, покупаем туда композици, получаем деньги за их исполнение, раз в эпоху получаем очки за известность композиторов. Продаём, в свою очередь, уже отыгранное. Удивительно, но механика очень точно ложится под дизайн и тему - действительно ощущаешь себя в эпохе Гёделя и Бетховена.

Минусы - длительность как у геймерских игр (около 2 часов), хотя в процессе даунтайма мало из-за способа активации персонажей. Требует не мало места, т.к. все компоненты призваны "восхищать" своим размахом.

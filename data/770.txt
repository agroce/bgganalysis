RATING: 8
This is a fun family game that plays best with at least 3 and preferably 4 players.  Gamewright recommends this for ages 10 and up, but my 7 yr old handles it just fine and has done for nearly a year.  There is enough luck involved that the kiddies stand a chance against the big folk, but enough strategy that it isn't mindless.  As with all Gamewright games, the cards are flimsy.  This is a serious drawback, especially since GW does not have a replacement policy for lost or damaged cards.  But, it really is a lot of fun -- my kids choose it pretty frequently for game night.

RATING: 6.9
It's a game that grows on you after a few plays. To do well, you need to do some minimal card counting (Captains, Admiral, 6,7, and 8 valued merchant ships). It also helps if you know how many of the powerful Pirate ships (the 4's) have been played. But since you only go through the deck once, this isn't too hard. Timing is also incredibly important - when do you drop those merchant ships onto the table? Sometimes you can sneek a few value 2 or 3 merchant ships out and back into your points pile while others are fighting over the 5's and 6's. This is a fine filler game especially for about 3-5 players (really unplayable with 2 players and anymore than 5 players and the game would drag). It's simply good "pirate" fun. (I own both the Loot and Korsar versions. While Korsar is quite attractive (artwork and box), I find its' larger cards difficult to shuffle. Loot has standard sized cards (inferior artwork) but are easy to shuffle and this version goes for only $5.95 at many of the large retail stores.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only really worth playing at low player counts (3-4?), in which case it is a fine filler. Otherwise way too chaotic to be worthwhile, unless that's yr thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 7 rating is less about the game and more about the fact that it can be played with couples and can accommodate up to 8 players.  This is a nice game to be played during some downtime, but it fails to grab me like other games that I have rated 7+.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another good "gateway" game.  Simple yet fun.  I tend to think it's still highly luck based with some strategy tossed in here and there.  But easy enough for people new to gaming to pick-up and excel at.  It always keeps you thinking and leaves you with some interesting options and dilemmas.  Those options are just weighed with odds though, you aren't guaranteed anything.  Fun pick-up game without a lot of thought needed.  Still, the strategy does seem limited.

Feels like there's a lot more here than meets the eye, and yet after several plays I'm still not sure there's much to this.  The mechanics are interesting but you can't help but feel they are unworthy of the pirate theme.  Maybe someday it'll click for us....

I saw it at Barns and Noble and I bought it for my sister to play. I hope she likes it. It has a good review. After playing it I enjoyed it and being that 8 people can play it and it is pretty simple it would be a good filler game between Shogun and Power Grid

Nice short game, with a good interactive play. If you like "Poker-type" games this might be something for you. With a limited set of pirate ship cards the players try to win the highest valued merchant ships. Due to a smart color system, this game is a good fast playable fun game.

RATING: 7.5
As far as card games go, it's great, with the huge amount of luck that one should expect from a card game. Nevertheless, there is room for a modicum of strategic thought. One should not play this game unless one is willing to talk with a pirate accent. The cards are somewhat flimsy. With its short length, it has all the requirements for a great filler game. I have yet to play the partnership version; it sounds very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great pirate card game. Fast, lite, but with enough decisions to make it worthwhile. A good filler game that seems to get at least 2 or 3 plays in one sitting. My only regret is the cartoon drawings of the pirates.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Fun game, but probably too quick.  I like how there are lots of decisions to make.  You have to decide every round whether to place another ship or attack a ship with a pirate, and if you keep track of who has taken what treasure cards, you can try to focus on a certain player to attack to pull yourself ahead.

I've played Loot, the Gamewright edition. There's some skill in hand management, deciding when to contest a ship, and when to play a merchant ship.  Large dollops of luck in the form of pirate captains, the Admiral and the draw of the cards.  Overall, distinctly average.  The cards in the Gamewright edition are not of the highest quality, but the artwork is quite jolly.

Plays better with more than two players, but most of my plays are just my wife and I.  If you're looking for a light filler type to play with friends or family, look no further.

{1 play • three 2-player partnerships} We had such a good time with this one, that we ended up wondering how the non-partnership game might be, suspecting that we might not enjoy it as much.

RATING: 5
This is a cute little card game that actively involves all the players.  It is not particularly strategic nor is it even tactical.  It is most closely a press your luck type game, but even that is not really an accurate label.  As a filler it serves fine.  It is typical of Knizia's card games - it's mechanical, it works, it's balanced, it's pretty dry.  The theme is easily lost.  The version I have has bad coloring making it extremely hard to distinguish the difference between the green and blue cards.  Playing this with anyone colorblind can lead to lots of frustration and slows the play.  Not my favorite, but I'd play it.

Luck of the draw can destroy this game to a degree I haven't experienced in other card games. That said, when the draw is not lopsided, Loot lends itself to some interesting strategic play. You have a limited supply of pirate cards to try to win merchant ships with, so you have to be judicious about using them.

RATING: N/A
This game is one of the few Knizias where I must disagree with the proposed number of players.  Two players is *right out*.  You really need three or more, the more the merrier, because you need the extra chaos and decisions that's simply generated by having more people around (and thus more ships battling in the waters until it's a foamy froth).  For this sort of game, I really think the new version is wonderful, because I think the art of the older edition took itself too seriously.

Extremely repetitive, the strategies are there (especially in a team game) but I fail to see the fun in the game.  It just seems like the game consists of the same decisions over and over again.

This was even a bust with the youth who love take-that style games.

One play (8-p).

I thought people were being melodramatic about the colors being hard to distinguish in the Loot version.

I was wrong - they suck bad. And I'm *really* forgiving about this sort of thing.

The game was fun, especially considering 8 people were involved. I'm definitely going to pick up Korsar.

--- 
Have played about 4 games now, all team-based. I enjoy this a lot (as does my lunch-hour group), but when you play with teams, it can take quite a while (so far, we're averaging around 50 minutes for a single 6-p game of 3 team). The partnership aspect is unique.

(KIDS) This game is a lot like Great Wall of China (also by Knizia) which I learned at the same time.  The main difference is that this game is less balanced with less options and is intended for kids.  It's actually not as good of a game, but I've rated it higher because it works better for the intended audience.

This is a fun little card game in which you play merchant ships with values ranging from 2-8.  Players place any pirate ship cards (numbered from 1-4 in strength) on your merchant ship in an attempt to plunder the merchant ship.  The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.  
This is a great game for beginners.  I got my non-gamer sister and her husband (who would tease me about playing board games, by the way) wanting to buy this game.  I myself, who like heavier and strategic games, also enjoy this game as a light card game that is good at breaking the ice.

Light game with some strategy.  Becomes a game of sneaking small or medium VP ships through, while opponents fight over bigger ones.  There is a lot of luck of the draw, but paying attention to which pirate captains (color) have been played can mitigate some of the luck.  The best part of the game is that you EITHER play OR draw on your turn, not both!  This makes for some tough decisions and saves the game from being ultra-light.

RATING: 7
With 2 games played, I am undecided about Loot.  It is light and fun (so far).  It's clear that there is some strategy to it, in terms of what you save for the high value ships, and what you spend in the beginning; when to draw and when to play merchants; etc.  My first two plays clearly show that I have not mastered the game yet.  But it also shows that, as with most card games, the luck of the draw has a heavy influence here.  Fortunately, the game plays fast enough that you don't have to suffer too long if your luck is poor.

I think this one is pretty neat. Not many other folks are jumping to play it, but its a worthwhile and effortless fun time, with some great choices. It's as dry as most games by the doctor, but still quite fun. I just don't expect it to have especially long legs, one game of it is usually enough for a while.

Fairly fun, but also frustrating if you draw either a lot of treasure ships or a lot of pirate ships, and not many (or any!) of the other kind. It's a quick game though.

My game group seems to like this one more than I do. It's definitely fun, but a bit repetitive. By the time a game is over, I'm ready to put it away for a week ... or two.

9/11/09 - Upgraded this game from a 7 to 8, based on the 6-player game. Team play GREATLY increases the strategic and tactical options in the game. The game truly shines with 6 players, based on the team rules. I'll always recommend and play this game for 6 players. The difference between solo and team play is significant. Team play really lets the game shine.

RATING: 7
I thought this was a really clever game.  I love how the theme is integrated into the mechanics.  A nice mix of strategy and luck.  

From reading the comments, I was worried the game would degenerate into a stare-down phase at the start as everyone kept drawing cards waiting for the first "sucker" to play a merchant card.  But, this was not a problem in our games.

The kids (age 7 and 10) enjoyed playing on teams with the grandparents.  However, grandma did not like the game so we have not played it again after the first night.  Not sure why she didn't like it.  As a result, I don't have a lot of experience with it.  My rating could go up or down with more experience; hard to predict.

One nice thing is that with team play, I could see this working for 8 people (4 teams of 2).  It's a rare card game that works for that number.

One complaint:  why oh why can't Gamewright make quality cards with a linen finish?  I can't see this deck holding up over repeated plays.

One more minor complaint:  why oh why did they make the green and blue cards so hard to distinguish?  Red!  Why not red instead of green?

I'd say this is really for 8 year olds and up.  My 7 year old did OK with it, but she got a little touchy each time someone attacked her merchant ships.  Between the slight rule complexity and the potential for frayed nerves as a result of the attack element, I think this works best with the 8 and up crowd.

I just don't understand what motivates people to make/own/play games of this nature.  A mercifully short card game, [thing=770][/thing] is basically an exercise in drawing well.  Here's a synopsis: Draw a card or play a card.  If you play a card, either lay a treasure ship in front of you or play a pirate ship to attack a treasure ship.  When it comes around to your turn, if your attack is still strongest (or your treasure ship was not attacked), you collect the treasure.  Pirate ships are better than treasure ships, stronger cards are better than weaker ones, and having large sets in a few colors is better than having a wide variety.  It's a good thing you have so much control over all that...

I've heard the phrase "left/right binding" being thrown around on this site before, but it's not something that I had meaningfully experienced until playing Loot.  The strategy of Loot essentially reduces to a series of binary decisions: hurt the player to your left, or help yourself and hope that the player to your right chooses not to hurt you.  Of course, because your ability to help/hurt is incredibly draw-dependent, making even that choice feel rather empty in the grand scheme of things.  Because it's a [person=2]Knizia [/person]design, I feel like there has to be more hiding here than I realize.  One play is probably not enough to have a good grasp of the game, but (hopefully) one play is all that it will get.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The tension comes a lot from when is it time to draw a card, and when is it time to try and get points. Since there is no maximum hand size, and the larger your hand is the easier it is to win points, it seems like the answer should always be draw cards. However, when the draw deck empties, the game ends as soon as someone runs out of cards, at which points a big hand is useless. So it's often a question of what you think is worth fighting over, and what you think others will think is worth fighting over to decide what to play and when. 

And always keep an eye on how many cards the other players have in their hands.

The biggest downside to the game is the luck of the draw (which pushes you to draw as much as possible in an effort to overcome it), as drawing pirates and the admiral are awesome, while drawing merchant ships, especially large quantities of them, is not so great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent little pirate-themed trick taking game that can be played individually or in partnerships (and scales well based on number of players.) The trick taking system is unique and it feels more like a pirate ship battle than standard trick taking. That said, the actual gameplay isn't all that interesting. Especially not when there are a lot of truly excellent trick takers around.

A math game pure and simple, but what makes it shine is how restrictive it is (can EITHER play 1 card or draw 1 card). Best with more players and Team Play is something different and why we keep it around.  Teaming up parents and kids or kids versus adults is a great way to skew this game younger or go head-to-head against your younger opponents.

Enjoyable filler game. A little too much luck (you can be hosed by bad card draws). To mitigate the luck, you could maybe create equal piles, and each player draws from their own - I need to try this.

Fun light card game. And not trick-taking, not rummy, etc. Main downside is that pirate cards are unequivocally better than merchant ship cards, and more skulls are always better than less, so luck of the draw plays a huge factor.

One of the funnest short and quick filler games I have played. Surprising amount of strategy for such a simple system, with lots of great player interaction and screwage. Pirate theme makes it even more fun, including the cartoonish artwork. Good with 2 or 3 players, but much better with 5 or 6, as interaction, competition, and trump risks increase. Fantastic for the price, too!

Hard to describe why this is so fun.  Thinking actually helps in this game, but there's a combo of strategy, press your luck, and luck of the draw that keeps it all light.  Games are 10 or 15 min., and you kind of want to play again right away.  It's also not always easy to tell who won, so counting up the coin cards at the end is a little suspenseful.

Production: Wonderful art on cards that are of medium-quality cardstock, but are nice and slick, and come in a an oddly-shaped yet oddly appealing elongated box.  Play: Only a few times have I faced tough decisions; usually my course of action is fairly clear.  The best moments come when I decide to back off a ship for the time-being, in the hopes that another player will keep it active, thus ensuring another go at it for me.  The least entertaining moments come when there is only one merchant ship out there, and I just play a card against it, or when there are none and I put out one of my own.  (2+0+2) (2 plays)

I actually own Korsar, which to me the art and ambiance makes it a much different (and better!) game than Loot!  This was the first game I played that uses the mechanic of laying cards so pointing at who played them.

Though I'm not a big fan of the random factor in most card games, I found this game enjoyable with >2 players (conditionally, that all the players know what they're doing).

Soooo vastly underrated.

First game was with three players...BEST THREE PLAYER CARD GAME EVER. Lots of strategy and lots of interaction. Then I played it with five players...BEST FIVE PLAYER CARD GAME EVER. More people means potentially more chaos and less control, but still plays essentially the same.

Don't let the marketing of the box/packaging fool you in to thinking this is a kids game; it's not. Sure, kids will take to it just fine, but this is an equally great gamer's game and/or must-have filler. Knizia strikes again and this is a lot of fun.

Given the price of this game and its availability, it's worth adding to your collection.

Date approximative du texte: 2002

Une belle réédition d’un jeu de carte de Reiner Knizia.
Il y a 3 types de cartes :
Les navires marchands dont la valeur est représentée par des pièces d’or.
Les navires pirates qui ont une valeur d’attaque représentée par le nombre de têtes de mort, et une couleur.
Les cartes personnages : il y a quatre cartes de pirates célèbres, une pour chaque couleur et une carte amiral.

But du jeu : être le plus riche en fin de partie

Préparation
Distribuer six cartes à chaque joueur, le reste constituant la pioche.

Le jeu
A son tour le joueur doit soit jouer une carte de sa main soit en piocher une et son tour s’achève.
S’il joue une carte navire marchand il la pose face visible devant lui.
S’il joue une carte pirate, c’est pour attaquer un navire marchand posé par n’importe quel joueur y compris lui même. Le joueur pose sa carte pirate autour du navire marchand. Il est possible de renchérir son attaque sur un navire marchand mais pour cela il faut jouer des cartes navires pirates de la même couleur.
Un joueur peut jouer une carte pirate personnage à condition qu’il ait déjà placé une carte navire pirate autour du bateau marchand et que la couleur du pirate corresponde à la couleur de son attaque.
Un joueur peut jouer la carte amiral, il s’agit d’une carte de défense qui se joue sur un de ses propres navires marchands.
Comment gagner des points ?
Il faut contrôler un navire marchand sur un tour. Lorsque le tour d’un joueur arrive et avant qu’il ne fasse son action, il examine la situation :
Si un de ses propres navires marchands n’a pas été attaqué, il gagne la carte.
Si il est le plus fort en terme de valeur d’attaque de pirate il gagne le bateau attaqué. Attention l’égalité en attaque avec un autre joueur n’est pas suffisante, il faut avoir une valeur d’attaque supérieure à celle des autres joueurs.
Les cartes personnages pirate et amiral sont plus fortes que n’importe quelle valeur d’attaque, si plusieurs de ces cartes sont jouées autour du même bateau il faut prendre en compte uniquement la dernière carte posée.

Fin de la partie
La partie se termine quand la pioche est épuisée et qu’un joueur n’a plus de cartes en main. A la fin de la partie chaque navire marchand posé sur la table est attribué au joueur qui le contrôle (pas d’attribution si égalité).

Score
Les joueurs additionnent la valeurs de tous les navires marchands qu’ils ont gagnés et soustraient la valeur des navires marchands qu’ils ont encore en main.


Jeu en équipe : 6 joueurs, 8 joueurs éventuellement 4 joueurs.
Une équipe compte deux joueurs placés l’un à coté de l’autre. Les partenaires peuvent se montrer leurs cartes et discuter mais l’échange de carte est interdit. Si votre coéquipier attaque un navire marchand vous pouvez renchérir à condition de jouer la même couleur que lui. Comme les partenaires jouent l’un après l’autre, seul le premier examine la situation de jeu pour voir si l’équipe à gagné un navire.
La partie se termine lorsque la pioche est épuisée et que les deux partenaires d’une équipe n’ont plus de cartes.

Mon opinion

Korsar est un jeu de carte tout à fait réussi, la prise en main est rapide et il y a des choix à faire constamment tout au long de la partie. 
L’idée originale c’est d’introduire à la fois plusieurs plis simultanés (en effet chaque navire marchand est la récompense d’un pli) et un timing serré. 
Plein de fourberies sont possibles : jouer un petit navire marchand de 2 après qu’un joueur en ait joué un de 6, comme ça les autres joueurs se désintéresseront du votre, jouer très sûr de soi avec un quatre en attaque même si vous n’avez rien en main pour renchérir sur votre attaque, ignorer un gros navire marchand pour forcer vos adversaires à l’attaquer, garder un gros navire marchand en main et s’efforcer de terminer la partie en posant cette carte…
Korsar prouve que facilité ne rime pas avec ennui, c’est le jeu parfait pour les vacances et les soirées où personne n’a le courage d’ingurgiter dix pages de règles.

Fun game.  Feels like it has some strategy to it despite an awful lot of luck.  It's very much about timing.

I'm OK with the art in the Gamewright production, but they did make some unfortunate design decisions.  I'll echo what others have said about the pirate ship colors being too indistinguishable.  This is annoying as it could have been so easily avoided with more distinguishable colors.  Or, every ship color could have had a different graphic.

The other issue is that the merchant ship values are represented by tiny stacks of coins in the corners of the card that are hard to read across a table.  A big printed number would have been far preferable.

The tactical decisions are really interesting, the game allows flexibility to play with different styles, and the captain and admiral cards can create rare surprises.

This is an odd trick-taking card game in that there can be multiple tricks going on at once.  You can play either point cards which start new tricks or suits of cards on a point card which helps you win the trick.  Point cards can be won by the person that played them if no suited cards are played on that card by the time it comes back to your turn.  This seemed really interesting but in the end it feels a lot more random than other trick-taking games.  The reason being is that if someone plays a suited card on a point card, that suit is essentially locked out from you.  Also the trumps are extremely powerful and there are only 5 trumps in the game.  Whoever get's these are in a very good position.  It's not a terrible game, but when compared to others I've been playing the low score feels justified.

Ancestor to Great Wall of China but we can see how far Knizia has come. In Great Wall, the tension is in getting into some massive battle with one of your opponents and then making the gut wrenching decision when to quit, if at all. In Loot, the card distribution is such that battles are decided after only one of two cards. Then, it just depends on luck of the draw who wins what. No real skill involved in this game, and I can't imagine what happens if you play with 8...

[10 plays] Great fun filler.  Takes almost as long to teach the rules the first time as it does to play, but then it plays in < 20 min.  Well-produced, just strategic enough, and gives you a chance to be piratey, which is always fun.  What, you don't think so?  Walk the plank, you landlubber!

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A simple card game with "push your luck" and "take that" elements that can be easily picked up by non-gamers. The one team-game I played with three pairs was too chaotic to engage my interest, however. May be better when not played in teams.

RATING: 6.5
The concepts of auction and especially trump were welcome at a table of what I would call 'non-gamers' but who were familiar with classic card games. Really, can you be a non-gamer?

I found the game light and entertaining but not particularly engaging or memorable. I would not turn down a round but neither am I excited about the opportunity to play.

I've now had the chance to play this 2-player, 4-player, and 6-player, and it's quickly become one of my favorite light games. It's simple enough, and doesn't pretend otherwise, but it can become fairly tactical here and there.

2-player is a strange experience, especially having played multiplayer previously, but still enjoyable. It's a solid 4-player game, but I think it really shines when you get to play with partnerships. Lots of fun to be had with this one.

Played this one again after a long time, never rated this.
It's a nice little card game, now available in several reprints..., okay game, but to much fun factor included.
The game could end before you think you had a change to participate. Nothing you won't remember soon.

Maybe on some evennings it will be an okay game to fill some time and space but there are too many nicer little card games available.

Gamewright makes some fun stuff.  Reiner Knizia is the best.  This is a very simple game where you launch merchant ships and try to keep them from being attacked by pirates until your turn comes back around.  All the while you're attacking other people's ships.  We always talk like pirates when we play this game.  GAR!  The artwork is WONDERFUL.

On the plus side, it is very simple to learn and teach...and pirates are cool :)

Very light fun.  Worked sort of "meh" for three, I think for five this would get really interesting.  Rounds passed two quickly with just three.  Just looking at how the game would play with two, I think it's criminal that they even advertised it as being playable that way...that would be awful.

Only one play with 2 and 3 players. 2 player is just ok, but three player is quite interesting. So, looks good, and would seem it would only get even better with more. (14/12/08 - rating 7).  UPDATE: Played again as as 3 and 4 player game; I really enjoy this game - a nice bit of mechanic thinking required for a pack of cards plus the bonus of a pirate theme - rating increased to 8 (23/10/11). UPDATE: Great with 5, and excellent card game that has not got old (Rating to 8.487).

Acquired December 2006 (a surprise gift from another BGG gamer)

[Original comment] This has become a real favorite in the family. I like it with any number of players from 2 to 8. The play tactics have to change with more players, but it is always a quick and fun game.

May 2009 -- We play this occasionally, mostly at my suggestion. I really enjoy it, but not all the family members care much for it.

October 2011 -- I have always enjoyed this game, but the rest of the family are not really wild about it. It only gets played occasionally.

2013-November:  We don't play this very often, but it's still fun.

This game seems like a super light "throw some cards down" kind of game, but there is quite a bit going on.

Loot is a great game for kids. It requires some simple strategic decisions and is easy to learn, but it's actually pretty fun to play. Some luck is certainly involved in that you have to play what you've been dealt or what you've drawn, but you also have to make some decisions about when to go all out to attempt to capture a ship. It plays better with 3-4 players than with 2.

It took a bit of convincing for the rest of the family to believe there was anything to this game, but by the third play they like it; well my parents did, not so much my daughters. I think that's because it plays like a trick taking game with some theme so my parents identified with it where as my daughters like more board gamey stuff - I think. Either way I hope it grows on them because it is a surprisingly fun card game with fair tactics and some strategy for a filler. Play seemed to be better with four than five and took only fifteen or so minutes a game.

The artwork is fun, but the production is poor. Colors are too similar. Card designs get monotonous. Also, the pirates are too powerful.

What a great little quick filler! I finally picked it up at a thrift store for a buck, and it was a great purchase.

Each turn players play cards to try to get their own merchant ships home, or capture those of others. In a way, it's very much like Exxtra!, but with cards. The theme plus the silly artwork naturally bring out pirate voices during play. It goes quickly with lots of "take that" action. Good fun.

Un juego de esos pequeñitos y baratitos que Yera compra para "hacer bulto". Este va de tematica naval/piratil y... eso y que es obra del gran Dr. Knizia es lo unico que se del juego, ya que todavia no he llegado a jugarlo. 

Resulta que es reedicion de uno de sus primeros juegos, que originalmente se llamaba "loot" (botín). 

Pendiente de primera partida.

Beautifully illustrated trick taking game with some interesting strategic choices. But it really shines in the partnership game. It is very interesting and unique to have partners sit next to each other and be able to look at each other's cards. This game works better with more players though, since it spreads the captains out. In a 2-player or 2-team game, very often the winner is whoever draws more captains.

A cute little card game that goes by so fast, especially with the more players you have.  The rules take a little bit of explaining to new players, but once they understand - games can be over in as little as 15-20 minutes.  We currently use it as a breather from our more intensive games and it works well in that regard.

While there is nothing earth-shattering about this game, like with other Knizia games it has really effective bare-bones to create an exciting pirate-themed tug-of-war. In short, players take turns drawing cards, playing loot on the table, or fighting over loot (won when they have the largest total at the beginning of their turn - or yours if you played the loot and no one else played on it!). Because everything is face up and delayed (minus your hand) means that you know who you're messing with and who is messing with you. The small constraints (such as first-come-first-serve on the four suits) means that the game does not simply come down to the accumulation of power (through lucky draws), as there is a lot of room for small but devious plays (e.g., dropping a low loot ship when everyone else is fighting over one worth twice as much). Fast and fun.

We have Korsar, with the more dignified artowrk, and that makes me happy.  I find the new art annoying enough that I probably wouldn't play as much.  Easy-to-learn game that plays quickly.  People tend to hoard cards until they can score the biggest merchant ships, but a player willing to settle for more of the small ships can often squeak out a victory.

Now that I've played this a number of times with other people, I'm very happy with the game.  It's quick, it's easy, but it also has some interesting strategies involved.  The battles that happen are done in a fun way, so even when there is significant screwage, there aren't any hard feelings after it's over.

Having such a short play time means it gets played fairly often now.  At the end of the night or while waiting for people - it's easy to fit a game or two of this in.

RATING: 6.75
Korsar is a classier German printing of Loot, less cartoony and more historic in regards the pirates and the ships, and in an attractive and entirely bigger than necessary black box.

But the game is the same- mixed of ships and pirates, can you get your ships thru, or should you focus on the opponents' for right now?

It's somewhat luck based, though there might be some reading of opposing players involved, but mostly a fast little filler game which goes quickly and doesn't overstay it's welcome- at that, one of the better Knizia games and desvering of a spot in the collection.

Hmmmm, not sure about this one yet. Definitely need 4 players. We've only run through it once. Need to try again before rating.

Update: A couple more plays, and the game is coming alive now. Third go was especially fun. I think this will soon join our selection of 'evening games before bed'. 

Pirate theme is always a winner at our house and the cute artwork and quick play are a bonus. Plenty of randomness due to card draw of course, but it still gives you enough choices.

Not a bad quick playing "filler".  The pirate theme really does carry it of course.

The actual game play is reasonably unique.  It adds the whole "do only one but want to do tons" game style to a simple card game.  Believe it or not, there were some ambiguities that bugged me still.

In the end, I'll enjoy it for the occasional play, but there are other card games that offer more enjoyable decisions while playing them.

Even tho... ARG!

Very simple rules and rapid play make this a solid family game. Only surprise was that my youngest son didn't find more interest in the theme, but probably says more about it being a Knizia game with a tacked on theme, rather than a pirate game.

update
Moved this up as a very good short game with five or six players. Lot of interaction/take that but with such a short game time that can hope to avenge a close loss on the next go. Seems to advantage the loud table talker pointing out other boats constantly as he slides his 2 and 3 ships through, though my conjecture is only anecdotal so far.

Another decent filler from Dr. Knizia.  Several choices, including knowing when to set a new ship sailing, when to attack, when to give up on an attack, when to draw.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2011)

It’s been years since I last played Loot. I don’t remember the specifics, but I remember I never liked the game. Loot was one of the games that disenchanted me from Mr. Knizia. On 2011 I liked almost every game I played, so if I rated Loot a 5.0 in that year the game was very bad for me.

Very dull game, my desire to play it again is very low.

Ships with different values are played in front of you. Then pirate ships with different values are played to attack those ships. You can attack your own ship to keep it. There are four pirate captains that can be used to help attack and one admiral for defense. A weakness was the random distribution of the pirates and admiral seemed to have too great an effect on the outcome of the game. It was still a fun light game and the cards look very nice.

Played once with 4 players. This is an interesting trick-taking mechanic with a nifty pirate theme. There's a bit of hand-management too as you can only draw a card or play a card each turn. Anbd the action doesn't start until someone plays a ship card which starts a trick, and several ships on the table represent several tricks all being played at once. It is interesting that while some players may just draw and build huge hands, another player could play cards quickly and force the end of the game. Smart players can make the pirates and admiral unbeatable, so an uneven distribution of these cards should make you a winner, just like in most trick taking games. This is a pretty good filler.

Loot certainly shares many similarities to other Knizia card-based games like Taj Mahal or Great Wall of China, mainly in the use of cards to resolve battles, wherein it is usually fruitless to get caught in a major card war.  I like the quick playtime and the theme is unusually compelling for some silly reason.  The game is very light and fun to play.  For a mass-market game that you can pick up at your local store, this is one of the best choices one could make.

[i]Yet another[/i] Knizia game where you assign resources to local tugs of war hoping to have a better return on investment than the next guy. This one allows three or four players, though I've only played with two, and in that case I think there is little to recommend it over Schotten-Totten. The green and blue ships in the Gamewright edition can be difficult to tell apart in low light.

The Good: This game is similar to "The Great Wall Of China", but easier to teach. Therefore, I plan to introduce new gamers to this game first, and then move on to the Great Wall. Does have a bidding aspect to it.

The Bad: I do not really like the card artwork all that much. Furthermore, most of the cards have more serious artwork, while a few are very cartoonish.

One of the best games for understanding the concept of "loss aversion" or for exploring certain game theoretic conditions, Loot is a must-have.  It also benefits significantly from enough memory and attention to keep track of multiple bids and card counts.

This is a game I love because it's on the one hand very easy (the rules aren't complicated at all), and on the other hand intensely difficult (because the interactions against skilled or smart players are extremely complicated).  Which means it scales very, very well depending on player level.

Works best with an odd number of players, particularly 3 or 5.  Seven works, too, but with that many players the game involves serious cognitive calisthenics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One play; two players.  Although the box states 2 to 8 players, I really don't see this as much of an entertaining game for only two players.  However, I see the potential with more players.  I'll try it again and may upgrade my rating.

Loot really requires 4 or 5 people for play; with 3 it's not much fun, and 2 is barely much of a game at all. Five, in my opinion, is best here, and it becomes a fairly quick and cut-throat game with this odd number. Fun with a crowd in the right piratey mood.

One of my most played games because it is quick and good pirate fun! 

+ With 3-players it plays very quickly as we played 12 times in two days. Needless to say, some in my family appear to be addicted to this game.

+ In general I like the dynamics of 4-players better. There are more options so that the player to your right has less chance to screw you over.

- If this worked with 2 players, I might have rated it higher. Unfortunately all the interesting choices with 3-4 players are lost in the 2-player game.

- Poor design for color-blind players. This is a shame as it would be easy to fix. Further, blue and purple are difficult to distinguish for non-color-blind people.

RATING: 7.5
4 games (2 x 3-player & 2 x 4-player) of the Gamewright edition with the poor card stock and hard to differentiate colours but light-hearted artwork.

Even with poor production choices this highly accessible card-trick game shines with 4 and lends me to believe would be of even more interest with 5 or as a partnership game.  Loathed to call it a filler game, a horrible f-word in my opinion, as it stands alone mixing quick play, a clear theme which supports the gameplay and ultimately what on first look appears to be simple choices provides enough flavour to keep your attention and make you pause for thought.

Recommended for groups of 4+ (with 3 players your turn comes again too quickly at the detriment of the game), with drinks, pizza on your plate and your best pirate impressions to hand.

One rule I would question or like to test is the no-limit to the size of your card hand.  A limit may discourage players from hoarding cards which looking at some comments post-game has caused some complaints . . .

Bluffing and overbidding others in an original card game, where you try to enter interesting ships that will bring you lots of points. 

I liked it in the beginning, but after a few plays I stopped playing it. Not sure why. Maybe it just doesn't have enough meat to stay exciting.

Great little Reiner Knizia card game for 3+ players.  My only complaint is about the cards in the 2005 Gamewright edition: 1. the arrangement of the skulls makes the card too wide
2. difficult to distinguish colors (esp. blue & green)
3. the finish is not particularly durable (no texture or coating)

I loved Loot and we played it lots at lunch time with my co-workers. Part of its genious is that each turn you must decide whether to attack, defend, or launch.

Loot got lots of requests and shares a similar broad appeal as Category 5 (aka 6 Nimmt, our current lunch-time game.)

For both games, by "broad appeal," I mean the several factors: easy to explain, yet challenging enough that a number of poker players who get into it, as well as "non-gamers" who also have fun and everyone wants to play again.

Short and sweet, I'd categorize this game as "big fun for small $"
I eventually bought a copy of "Korsar," the German edition too.

The cards are smaller than I was expecting and I really don't like the card-tuck style box.  The artwork is nice on the merchant ships and the pirate ships but I'm a little put off by the very cartoonish pirate captains and the admiral. My wife said if she'd seen the box in the store she never would have bought it thinking it a young child's game. However, the Mensa and Dr. Toy award stickers did catch her eye and she looked at it long enough to recognize the Knizia name.

The game is a light filler and plays very quickly. I've played 3 and 4 person games and it feels about the same heaviness as 6-Nimmt...maybe slightly heavier.

First game was 2 player and lots of fun.  I think though that we'll try more players before finalizing our rating on it.  Besides... Kim won again... Kim always wins.

Second game on a meet up night and I have to learn the rules better before I offer to run a game.

Pirates is always a great theme!  Gameplay is fun - though I feel a little unbalanced at times due to the merchant to pirate card ratios.  I like the caricature style of Loot, but I'm hoping to pick up a Korsar deck too.

Fun and light card game. Has slightly weird choices / incentives (i.e. it's usually not clear that playing a merchant ship is actually a good idea). The only real flaw is that it's hard to tell the green pirate ships from the blue ones.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell:  Players lay down ship cards and try to steal them from each other by having the highest amount of Pirate points influencing the card.

Played as:  3,4 player

Pros:  A solid little spin on a trick-taking game that isn't as simple to figure out as it might first appear. There's a fair amount of decision to be had in something as simple as 'play a card' or 'draw a card' when there's several ships on the table and you can't win them all. Has a short set of rules that allows new players to get started quickly. Plays fast enough that it fills the in between times just fine.

Cons:  The game-play boils down to be a simple, abstract card game so don't come in expecting much pirate-y goodness. Nothing revolution-ly original about the design. Lady Luck can serve you a crap hand that isn't going to do you any good no matter how you play it.

Other:  It's funny, this game is exactly what you'd probably imagine a Knizia and Gamewright collaboration to be.

Best Use:  A good filler or for a game night warm-up.

- May be repetitive when playing more than one game

Another really great game for young kids.  I rate it a 9 because I'm looking at it in terms of a game for a young child.  Our son started playing this when he just turned 5.  It seemed a little difficult for him right then but about 8 months later, he was very into it.  And he can beat us. After much searching for kid's recs at BGG back in January this is one of the games that made my final buy list and it was a good choice.  I recommend it for people who want to play a game with a young child that's more involved than games standard kid's games.  We enjoy it too and it's a good light family game.

A game I enjoy playing.  Plays well with adults and children.  The cards could be better as the blue / green are too similar particularly in low lighting and the skulls should run vertically rather than horizontally so you can hold your cards normally.

This plays well with the kids, I might even bring it out for the gaming group.

[b]Loot[/b] was traded away in a math trade 8/8/14. (With Love Letter and Cheaty Mages for Pyramix)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]Another okay game that we got when we did not have many games. Part of it may be the meta game that my family has developed, where everyone stockpiles cards before trying to sneak some ships by. This game is very light and really shows it's age when compared to other card games, definitely not a game I need to play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a very basic trick taking game, with a few cards that have special powers. This game plays quick, so we play before bedtime or as a filler during our family game night. This game is a great intro into trick taking games for kids due to the ease of game play and great theme. 

This game plays well at 3 or 4 players, I would not recommend it for 2 players. This is my least favorite card game that we own; I would always rather play Morels, Jaipur or Guillotine (when we have more than 2 players). I would only recommend this game to play with younger kids as an intro into trick taking games.[/i]

This is a fine seamless 2-player game, but I'm not so sure it is as good with more players! The card art is absolutely great...sets the pirate mood very well! It is a quick and simple game to play that is quite enjoyable, but a little frustrating for colorblind players! Play a card with some number of gold pieces on it, then play a pirate ship, and match the flag symbols to win the gold. The player with the most gold collected at the end wins! There are crazy captain cards and even an admiral to spice things up a bit too!

RATING: 5
I was expecting a little more, but it seems a light enough rolling multi-trick game. Eventually people will start playing ships worth VPs out to the table and that's when you decide either to play pirate cards against them to try and win them, play a ship yourself to see if you can get away with no one playing on it (you'll win it if no one plays pirates against it for a round) or draw cards hoping to draw more pirate cards for more firepower. So the game boils down to watching who's earned the most VPs so far and ensuring they don't get easy points, playing for ships where you have a high expectation on other people not playing or are willing to spend a few turns competing for a particularly high valued ship in a colour you're long in. Therefore ... a game where your result is mostly determined by other people (do they compete against you or not). It's fine if no one takes it seriously and the game flies by; draggy and a bit pointless if it's taken too seriously.

Kids seems to like this card game by Knizia. Can be played with few or many players. The artwork is hilarious and colorful. No text on the cards, just a few simple icons.

My nongaming daughter enjoys this game, and has claimed our copy.

I'm no good at this game. I also prefer Fuji Flush to this.

family filler.  Works with larger groups, nice to introduce gaming to party tables.  Can be played while inebriated! The colors are hard to distinguish in low light, which is this game's biggest flaw.

RATING: 4
Didn't really think this one was a lot of fun.  It seems like there's little disadvantage to just drawing cards instead of actually doing anything.  The game can devolve into a game of chicken if no one is willing to play a merchant ship.

RATING: 5.7
Quick attack/bidding game by R. Knizia. Players are mighty pirates who attack merchant ships to steal ye gold. The game revolves around building a good deck of hands, playing merchant ships and attacking others' ships to loot them. It can be fun, as you can just wait for other players to start attacking each other and dividing their forces; then you can just strike, play your rich merchant ships and easily defend them, while rival pirates kill themselves!

I think this is probably one of the best card games.  There is some pirate elements to it, however it's light.  It's easy to learn, there's some strategy, and you can steal your opponents' vessels--what's not to like?

I also found that even with the pirate theme, it's well-accepted by most non-gamers of both genders.

RATING: 3
Not a very fun game. I don't understand why Mensa would give mention to this mediocre game where no particular faculty is required to play. The one who gets the most Captain cards has the best odds of winning. Since that is determined by drafting luck, there is really nothing memorable about this game. Maybe it was meant to be played with +4 players, but then it only becomes a game of mutual distraction and inability to act on all opportunities - so a guessing game really.

I find it really amusing that card games in the English speaking world are percieved as toys for kids and in the Germanic realms, they're much more adult. Witness Loot - it's cartoony and bright. The original German Version was classy and minimalist and aimed at adults.
Either way, a nice card game, easily learned and with a deal of thought needed.

A fast game that most people can follow.  Can be pretty fun when in the right mood, but it really needs multiple players.  I tried it with just one other once and the rules make it so you can both just sit there and do nothing while hoarding pirate ships.

AAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!

RATING: 6
Game play is not only simple, but is also evocative of theme, as merchant ships are set afloat onto the table to then have pirate ships placed alongside. To play well involves commiting to mind a diverse, irregular card distribution then recalling discards,considering tabled cards and what may be left to draw. There seems to be more of a tendency of drawing on your turn so hand size becomes an issue. Maybe best to play with 4 as with 3 there seems to be a conflict with 2 with the 3rd player getting away with the spoils; a 4th player may be able to step in, contesting the easy gains. Have played 4 player partnership, unique in that you sit side by side discussing what to play. I found this unsatisfactory, as there can be some time consuming discussion and  one personality may dictate play. It also caused some confusion as to when to claim ships. Note that the Mik's translation is correct in regards to turn options.

Old Knizia that fares surprisingly well by today's standards. It's no Modern Art but for a quick high-luck casual card game it's not bad. The partnership option makes for a more fun experience and there's definitely some tactical decisions as to when to try to sneak ships out and how much to devote to a given ship. I'm not sure I'll be suggesting this very often but for the time it takes I'd almost never turn a game down.

RATING: 6
The art was a turnoff for me, so I was very hesitant to give this a try, but it turned out to be a very enjoyable quick playing filler game. Players each get a hand of cards from a common deck. The deck has both pirates and merchants. You play merchants in front of you, and other players try to claim them by placing their pirate cards next to your merchant card. At the start of your turn, if you have the most strength next to the card, you can  claim it. We enjoyed it enough to play it twice as it had interesting tension and cute player dynamics where people would try to sneak out lower value boats when someone already has a higher value one in play in the hopes it would be ignored.

You get to either play one card or draw one card. If you play, will you have enough cards left to back up your play? If you draw, are you letting something go? And that doesn't even begin to get into the different colors, the mercahnt ship vs. pirate ships, and the captains. Great game!

GameWright and Reiner Knizia team up to give you...exactly what you'd expect from GameWright and Reiner Knizia, which is a good thing. It's simple enough for kids, abstract enough to put gameplay ahead of flavor, and strategic enough to be enjoyable by any gamer. Merchants and Marauders might be the 'definitive' pirate game, but this is the definitive quick pirate game.

Jogo de cartas com tema de piratas... joguei apenas sem ser em duplas, apenas jogadores individuais. Gostei bastante... como todo o jogo onde se compra cartas, há sorte envolvida, mas há de se pensar em estratégias sobre como melhor usar suas cartas.

O jogo é rápido e dinâmico, flui bem e apresenta desafio, mas um jogador mais experiente tem grande vantagem sobre os outros, se souber memorizar as cartas que já saíram, pois com experiência de jogo é possível trabalhar melhor as probabilidades, enfim.

As ilustrações são bem muito boas, mas a diferenciação das cartas coloridas de barcos deixa um pouco a desejar.

O material construtivo da caixinha e das cartas é bom... não excelente... mas é bom. Merece sleeves nas cartas para conservar melhor.

Definately not a deep strategic game - if you draw pirate ships, you'll win. The age recommendation is confusing me - why 10-up? There are no words to read, and the rules seem simple enough. I'd guess 6 year olds could play this. And the art is definately kid-appealing, further confusing why the 10-up?  If it was with kids, and frequent thematic Yaarhh'ing, my rating could go up to 8. After more plays, there are more faints and risk-taking involved for good play than initially thought. And it's not as good for kids as I'd thought/hoped. Not bad, just not a fun-fest of a game. It's kinda work - but better for adults than I'd first thought.

So you are a Pirate, and you mean to take down as many merchant ships as you can, trying to concentrate your efforts on the more valuable ships.

RATING: 7
Your standard Knizia card game. Simple rules and interesting choices (for a filler), this time in the theme of pirates. And who doesn't like pirates?!

Players are dealt a random hand and fight for merchant ships with different values. In your turn, you can either play a card or draw a card. If you play a merchant ship, anyone can attack it with pirate ships (and the fight lasts until the turn comes back to you and you're still winning). So where do the decisions come? There are quite a few: do I attack that low value ship with my good cards or do I save them for something better? Should I play my good merchant ship now, will I be able to defend it? And so on... Oh, plus there are some "special" cards (pirate leaders) that trump all other pirate cards (unless someone trumps your leader with his leader).

Like I said, fun, albeit a bit standard Knizia card game ;) Four players feels like a sweet spot.

I've found the game to be simple and fun every time. The only complaint I have is the game can suck a big one if you draw nothing but merchant ships. I play the game with 2 combined decks and that has increased the fun factor plus I removed some of the lower value merchant ships from deck 2 as that gives more pirate ships and more fighting. After at least 100  plays I still like this game.

I think I need to try this again sometime.  There seems to be a real incentive to stock pile cards rather than play.  I guess the "check" to that is that if any one person plays a card, you'll need to play to get involved in the fray or lose out.  I do like the way the game plays, but I'm hung up on that card draw aspect.  I'm willing to try this one again and see if my initial impression is way off base or not.

A neat little card game with a pirate theme.  Luck of the draw comes into play but a fair amount of startegy is worked into this 20-minute game.

An interesting little cardgame that I bought at Target.  I like the stylized art and am alwasy looking for a pirate game.  I do wish that the pirate cards had pirates on them instead... making the game prettier...  (a weak pirate for a 1 and a scary pirate for a 4).  Game play is smooth with intersting decisions, but bad starting hands or really good starting hands dont help this one.

(Korsar version, beautiful artwork!) A classical example how a "simple trick-taking game" by Reiner reveals hidden depths after some plays. It's short, and my 10-year-old loves it, so we play it quite often.

Fairly light game of trying to take over ships with your pirates, at heart a simple majority style card game.  OK but nothing special.

RATING: 7
This is a fun card game that's versatile.  Play individually or as teams.  The one down side is that everyone can team up against one specific player or team.  Because of this, the winner is the person that just happened to not get picked on so much.  But in spite of this, I enjoy this game.

Here's an interesting variation on trick taking: playing multiple tricks at once. Haven't played this with more than 4, but expect it to shine then. Turns are quick, decisions are few but occasionally difficult, encourages double guessing.

Traded away because there's too much Mensa in this game.

Loot is simple to explain, but deep enough for many repeat plays. There's some luck in which cards you're handed, but all cards have their uses and your hand influences the playstyle you'll use more than whether you'll win or not.

This game is also unique in that it plays up to four, but also plays either six or eight in "teams." Increasing the player count defies expectations, though: the team game is even more fun that the four player version. Everyone has their own hands to play and restrictions on card-trading means you're always working with your ally, but quarterbacking is minimal. Strongly recommend this at six or eight players.

RATING: 6
An enjoyable game. I like the way that cards are physically played, with the keel oriented to the player who played the card - both a useful way of indicating which card is which, but also a mechanic that leaves the table looking like there are little sea battles going on all over it. The colours can be hard to distinguish in poor light in the cartoony edition, I think I would prefer the older, drabber style, was that Korsar? I see that the mechanic is listed as "auction/bidding" rather than "trick taking", which makes sense now I think about it. This game is a classic Knizian combination of theme and mechanic, an aspect of his games that I suspect only elitist snobbery fails to recognise. Works with two, more fun with more, best with 3 or 4?

Juego rápido, fácil de explicar, con amplia gama de jugadores puesto que pueden jugar hasta 8, y con la posibilidad de jugar en parejas. El objetivo es capturar galeones repletos de oro valiéndonos de cuatro tipos de barcos de guerra y también proteger los propios. Y todo se maneja con una sencilla baraja de cartas en la que encontraremos barcos de guerra de 4 tipos y colores, capitanes pirata y galeones. Un juego para todos los públicos pero con la profundidad necesaria para que disfruten también los jugones. Ideal para reuniones familiares o bien para desestresar la mente después de una dura jornada de eurogames. Aprovechad la nueva edición de Homoludicus con portada de Chechu Nieto, ¿por 12 pavos qué más se puede pedir?

I rated this one so low for the two player aspect just not being very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've only played this two player, which is rather dry and mostly chance-based. I imagine it plays MUCH better with 4 or more players. The rules weren't clear on if you could discard as an action under any conditions other than having no more legal actions to take due to an exhausted draw pile, but we played no. I think the game would play a lot better if you had to play or discard each turn and always drew back to six at the end, but I haven't tried it. In our game, one player drew a lot of pirate cards, and the other player drew a lot of merchant ships. It was no contest, the pirate won. I doubt this would be as much of a problem with more players, but I can't see it disappearing completely.

UPDATE: Played this six players. It's a bit of mad chaos. Players who put out a merchant ship might not be able to add their own pirate as defense because there are only four unique pirate colors. If all four fill up before it goes around, you're stuck. The game ends a little too soon with six. I think it's better with fewer.

I own the Pirat edition.  We had a lot of fun playing what we thought would be a relatively simple game.  However, we found plenty of tactical decisions to be made.

A game I picked up in early 2000 just to pass the time at home. It can be fun with the right people. The trump card pirates and admirals are always fun to play and have played against me. There is a moderate amount of strategy that goes into playing your cards. I would still sit for a game of Loot but I don't purposefully bring it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Loot -- Played once; four-player.

Simple, familiar, yet innovative.  The artwork in the Gamewright edition is fun, but it is the mechanics that dazzle me.  Multiple tricks laid out separately – all constantly in peril.

Extremely minor implementation issue:  Since the orientation of the cards is important to the gameplay, the card indexes should only be at the tops of the cards.  This would prevent players (me) from holding them upside down in their hands, then playing them from their hands to the table still upside down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Early, vintage Knizia, with all of his trademark qualities in place: a card game, a game of chicken and guessing out the groupthink. This time done with a sort of trick taking meets bidding. Not a bad game, but he made a lot of better ones. Didn't really excite me in any way.

RATING: 5.5
Played once with 3P. It could be that my group was playing it wrong, but the endgame was rather strange and lacking tension. There is an interesting concept behind timing the play of merchant ships, like slipping in low valued ships when all the guns are trained on the high valued ships. Otherwise, this is a very average filler game.

One of those games that you go into thinking it's patently simple--and then the levels begin to show themselves. But then, it's a Knizia. Surprisingly deep.

RATING: 5
[3 plays] Relies on the simple "strategy" of drawing the powerful cards and of timing your ship laydowns in hopes of avoiding the hostile attention of your opponents. If one or more of them decide to go toe to toe with you once too often, you'll both lose - yeah! I guess I can think of 25 good card games I'd rather play that are more fun, offer more in terms of controlling your own destiny, and come without the element of mindless game-sealing brinksmanship this game can foster.

I'll maybe play this again with kids or in a non-gamer social environment - and I'll just laugh politely when anyone pretends there was more than an ounce of skill to their victory.

Most recent play 11-24-06 with Mindy, Barb, Garrett, and Kay.

Dreadfully simple Kniza card game that's too easy for adults and too complicated for kids.

Players are trying to play cards of different values and colours (overly hard to differentiate) in order to capture points.

Far too much luck for me:  you often get cards that are impossible to win with; or cards (hello, Admiral) that are impossible to lose with.  The fights can sometimes be fun, but the game can also seem repetitive.  I haven't played the partnership game, which might be a completely different kettle o' fish.  As a children's game (which is how Gamerwright is marketing it), I'd rate it an "8".  The Korsar version has *excellent* artwork and a cool box.

I love this game!

Cons: I dont think there are really any cons unless your idea of this game is anything but a nice fast fun game. Probably what would annoy people the most is the luck factor and the limitations of action selections (only allowing for one action per turn) but I see this also as a mechanic to allow the game to be what it is - fast and kind fun!

Pros: OK, I love Pirates but this is a cute and fast card game. We use it to often end the night on a light note or begin the evening as a warm up that is not intimidating - great if you or a guest is feeling a little game shy. I up graded my rating because I think people underestimate the benefit of these sort of games to the group dynamic.  

UPDATE 2007: I still play this A LOT! its always a nice starter game and while I find some let these games fall by the way side - this one is always enjoyable, light but fun.

Some strategy, some tactics, some bluffing, some set collection (well, at least it pays to have pirate ships of the same colour to go attack a trade vessel). Easy to teach, hard to master, yet not overly complicated or long. Just the perfect balance for a light filler. My copy also has the "MENSA Select National Competition Winner" sticker on it, so it must be good : )

RATING: 2
How this butt baby got into print three times is beyond me.  It seems, first of all, that everyone should just continue to draw cards over and over and over.  As soon as some chump sacrifices their advantage, and lays a card down, then it comes down to whoever has drawn the right cards from that point on.  Every card has a very distinct value and the low cards don't really serve to do anything other than facilitate a captain coming aboard or to stake a claim, but the high cards do that as well.  It seems that the game would have more elegance without card values.  So lesson is: draw high cards and captains. God forbid you draw ships or else you lose two turns and give other's points (unless they aren't paying attention) otherwise uh-oh negative points for you.  Having the game end with one person going out seems problematic as well.

To make matters worse the art looks like they took in thalidomide spawned refugees from the Honeycomb Hideout.

Clearly all it takes to get a Mensa award is a night of cheap hookers.  I don't even want to know what you need to please Dr. Toy.

Gamewright edition. Great little game, but the table can get a little complicated when trying to remember whom each pirate ship is facing and the colors are not always quickly distinguishable.

This is another game that has become popular in my board game club. It's most often played by the kids who show up early who are waiting for everyone else or at the end of the night when there's spare time but whenever we're waiting around for anything at all the first thing I hear is "LET'S PLAY LOOT!" and someone grabs the box. They seem to like it.

Loot is a hoot, and I'm not just saying that because it rhymes (okay, maybe I am - it's not actually that much fun).  You wouldn't want to play it with just 2 players (I would think it's best with at least 4), but it's a mildly entertaining filler for a small group.  However, the absolutely infuriating part of this game is the colour choices.  I'm most certainly not colour blind, but even I can barely distinguish between the blue and green cards in anything but the brightest of lighting conditions.  It is MOST frustrating!  So if you're colour blind, don't even bother.  But if you're not, and you can get past this little wrinkle, you might find an enjoyable little card game that fits in a pocket or a purse, or the pocket of a purse, or a man-purse.

Korsar has very attractive card artwork and is a fun game for partnerships (with its weird rule that partners sit next to each other and get to see each other's cards and discuss strategy).  This game improves upon the use of Knizia's idea in Digging that you either play *or* draw a card (not both!) on your turn.

I enjoy this game.  It's a light filler-type card game that has just a touch of strategy.  It plays quickly and is easy to learn, so non-gamers should enjoy it a lot too.  It also makes for some fun interaction between the players as they decide which merchant ship to attack, or not attack.  Overall a great value in a compact little package.

Simple and fun.  There are a good number of quick games that I'd rather play that are more complicated, but this works for teaching someone the barebones of area control and hand management.

[Gamewright 'Loot' 2005 Edition] {Pirates, Kid; bidding, partnership; optimal 4-8p} Loot is lightweight card game from Knizia. Its core mechanic is bidding but it has a new twist: a trick holds until a clear winner is resolved. It's fast-paced and fun. There are some decisions to make but I don't think it's worth the Mind Game award. It's very decent for children but only average for veteran players of bidding and trick-taking games.

Since there are 40 pirates, 4 captains and 1 Admiral cards to capture 25 ships, some ships should survive without any pirates. This happens all the time in our games; thus, one has to determine the right time to get some "free" ships :)  Besides, players have to place the ships timely because extraneous ships in hand will deduct points when the round ends. Players have several options per turn but the decisions are not difficult but they are enough for children and casual players. Luck in the card draw is quite important in Loot; yet, clever and experienced players still have above-average chance of winning. 

The partnership rule is so artificial. It adds nothing to the game except more players are involved. There are other better partnership games.

A light game that plays quickly and rewards thought.  Nice mix of bluffing and counting.  The art is well one, but be sure to play at a well-lit table - the blue and green cards are hard to distinguish in low light.

RATING: 6
An ok light game: short, simple, looks nice and quite exciting. Quite a lot of luck but in quick games like this one it really doesn't matter (you can always take a rematch)... and there's still enough strategy and decisionmaking to keep it interesting. Not jumping up and down of enthusiasm though.

RATING: N/A
Picked this game up for £7.99 from Borders (UK). Didnt know what to expect but I had seen good reviews for the game on the geek. I playtested the game with my wife and we quickly got into the game but we found that two player games didnt work that well. I took the game along to Deeside Defenders (Broughton, Nr Chester) the next day and introduced the game to 5 new players. Explaining the rules was quick enough and what with players itching to get going we started. It was clear very soon after we started that the game was a hit and unsurprisingly once the game was over (about 30 mins) we started again almost immediately. I would highly recommend this game for gamers and non-gamers alike.

A light-hearted pick-up-and-play type game that's nice to have around.  I have only played the 2-player variant of this game, and it was not engaging enough to hold my attention for long.  However, I suspect with more people it would be more fun.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Plays very well with 3 to 6 (haven't played with more yet).  With two players, the games are very skewed based on the draw, but still a lot of fun if you take it lightly.  Feels a lot like Hearts, and not just in the trick-taking but in the ebb and flow of the values of the tricks.  The colors of the suits is a definite problem, and there should have been different symbols in addition to the colors.  One very good thing is that you can get this game for less than $5 at WalMart.  This game playes very will with kids.  Not a good choice as a 2-player if either player is new to the game.  Looking forward to trying out the partnership rules.

I quite like this one as a very quick filler - you can get it done in 15 mins pretty easily. I imagine an experinced player could really blow everyone else away with a sound mathematical strategy - seems like that type of mechanic. Quite interesting how the game takes advantage of human nature to stop you from backing down from a fight with a lot invested in it, even though you are actually usually hurting yourself by ignoring easy riches elsewhere.

Very interesting after a couple of plays. I dont know how long the interest will last. You are basically bidding on ships to loot and each is worth victory pts. It has a kind of clunky mechanic where you have to decide to put a ship out there or bid on one already out there which somehow seems to take out some of the excitement. We played four and there might be problems catching the leader in this. It's slightly on the long side, maybe 45 min. but worth trying out.

The people I play with seem to like the game. It's light and they enjoy the pirate theme. But, in my opinion, this game lacks elegance. Every time I play it I feel like something is wrong. 

Everyone builds up these huge arsenals in their hands and is scared to play any merchant ships. I don't want to play any big merchant ships without a large arsenal because odds are someone else will get it -- I'd rather it ended up unscored. 

One time, the draw deck was exhausted, all I had in my hand were pirate ship cards, and no one had played any merchant ships. This situation isn't covered in the rules. I just decided I couldn't do anything and passed my turn. When it got back to my turn again, all I could do was play a pirate on a merchant ship I couldn't win.

Often you end up with unplayable cards, and thus can't go out. Like a pirate captain without any matching colored pirate ships. Or an admiral without any merchant ships. And it's often through no fault of your own -- the offending card just happens to be one of the last few in the deck. This just seems like a flaw in the design. Having to keep extra cards in your hand just to prevent getting an unplayable card just makes the card hoarding problem I mentioned above worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is not a terrible filler, but it does seem a little too luck based.  Sometimes you just don't have any pirates, or none in the right color anyway.  There are some fun timing tricks, but all in all, there isn't much here.

Great for buccaneers with short attention spans. Quick fun, but don't expect much in the way of strategy. I've added a house rule hand limit of 8 cards with some success to keep things rolling. Otherwise, many players simply keep drawing until their hands are well stocked, slowing the action.

Description for the Heidelberger release:

Essen release, 2002. In the nice small black box, with embossed lettering. An improved version of Buccaneer. This game has 25 Trade ships worth different amounts of gold (from 2 to 8), 48 Pirate ships, 12 each in 4 colors. The Pirate ships are worth 1-4 skulls (the player with the most skulls played on a trade ship captures it if the lead is kept for one full pass around the table). There are 4 Pirate Captains (1 of each color) to help win the battles and 1 Admiral to help defend the trade ships. The game is playable with 2-5 players individually. With partners it can be played with up to 6 or 8.

The color scheme is terrible and we often times have trouble distinguishing ship designations.  This one's not hitting the table for awhile for that reason alone.   

I knocked it up a few ratings just now, because it's still a good trick-taking game for children.  And they are apparently our future and stuff.

This was a one of those random purchases that turned out to be pretty nice.  Rules are fairly simple and the game is pretty fast pace.  It's not quite as fun to play with only 2 players but you can do it.  We've played with 4 so far and that was a blast.  Great artwork on the cards and it wasn't expensive either.

Knizia; Card Game; The cards show trading ships and pirate ships, with pirates and an admiral. Players send a trading ship of value on a voyage in which it must survive a round of attacks from other player's pirate ships. You defend your traders with your own pirates and collect the spoils of your attacks elsewhere.

I've got Korsar, the german edition. It's serious, not funny like the American one, has a more elegant looks of the cards and of the box as well. Love this sense of fighting battles! But aren't there too many vessels with gold???

Que grande surpresa! E das boas!

Achei que fosse um jogo bem bobinho, mas se mostrou um baita jogo!!! Muito leve e fácil de pegar, todo mundo que jogou curtiu.

Há navios mercantes com vários valores de moedas, e navios piratas com vários valores de ataque. Os jogadores devem juntar o máximo de moedas até o fim do jogo. Para ganhar um navio mercante, deve ter a maior força de ataque, ou então colocando seu próprio navio mercante no mar e ele não sendo atacado.

Really - this seems more about trying to slip those valuable merchantmen by (especially with 2-players) than naval duels.

This is a cute game, but sadly isn't too deep (it seems to depend a lot on just who gets the fewest treasure ships). Still, the mechanic of playing pirate ships to steal treasure ships is fun and works well as a whole.

RATING: 6
Very, very tactical. I didn't like that there was only 1 Admiral and that it was entirely possible (maybe even probable) that you'd have an unusable pirate captain in your hand for much of the game. I suppose if you're in a group of people who are all really good at counting cards, it would make the endgame more tense, but I'm not, so it wasn't. Having said all that, this has more interesting decisions than most games as light as this one, and I think it would be great with elementary schoolers, maybe except for the art. (Aesthetics of a game very rarely sway me very much, but in this case I found the art actively abrasive.)

Have played this game quite a bit now as my 7 year old son can't get enough. Interesting enough strategy to keep me interested. Knowing when to slip in merchant ships when others are battling it out is a key strategy in my opinion. Plays ok with 2 but much better with more. I am sure this one will be on the table for a while.

RATING: 7
With a full compliment of 8 (in 4 teams of 2), I give this game at least an 8.  With less, a 6 or so.  The amount of strategy is decent either way, though there is a large big amount of luck in who draws the captains and admiral.

The real fun for our group, however, is in the team game, and it happens mostly above the table.  Planning out your actions collaboratively is fun, but even better is the high potential for bluffing.  Since so much depends on timing your captain and admiral plays right, we are constantly making ourselves "accidentally" overheard in order to try to force a certain card to be played or wheedle information out of the opponents.  It's just a really fun dynamic where you're constantly whispering with your partner, but often in a way to try to influence the other players.  Not sure if this sort of things would happen in all groups, but it makes our 8 player games of Loot a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
pretty get little card game. There is so much going on in this game. I think that with 3 players it is a great game because it really does give a good feeling of tug-o-war.  Trying to block both players can become difficult and it makes for a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.3
A nice Knizia variant on trick taking where you set the trump and need to anticipate where others might play or increase their card to take trump.  All done to the theme of pirates and merchant ships.  A fast filler that plays up to 8 in teams.

RATING: 7
Not a good 2 player game, however as a team game it's really fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game.  Fast, and the theme is well implemented.  Luck of the draw is big, and appears at first to make the game one that is driven too much by luck.  It's not so much the case as first appears, and the game ends up being a good balance bewteen the two.  Still drawing a lot of 4-strength pirates, the Admiral and Pirate Captains means you've got a huge advantage.  I wish there was some way to balance those, while keeping the the simplicity.  If one can be found, this game would be great, rather than just very good.
I was thinking of using coins (that count the same as merchant ships), and you pay one each time you use a 4-pirate or captain/admiral, while getting a coin each time you play a 1-pirate.  I'll try that when I get the chance.  Might not be worth the added (relative) complexity.

This is a neat set collection game along the lines of spades, or hearts.  But with a neat twist. you play ships worth points first.  then everyone plays cards of increasing value (a different suit for each player) to aquire those points.  This could be a fantastic game, if a little more care had been taken in the color choice.  Two of the colors (blue & the other blue (which I'm told is purple)) are indistiguishable.  & I have some trouble with the other two colors in the right lighting.  My daughter has generously marked the deck to adapt this to playable status.  But it's color blind unfriendliness really took it's toll.  I keep this game around & will play if enough people really want to play it.  But will never suggest it myself.

As long as you don't try to force a strategy upon the cards you draw, I think you should always be able to compete in this game.  If you draw nothing but merchant ships, but play them every turn, you should get a number of them through.  If you draw a lot of pirates, then sack others' ships.  Interesting, quick game!

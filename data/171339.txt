Excellent game! The beginning is shy and every action is likely to end in a "clash", but once the actions begin to be understood, it is possible to develop more and better strategies and the game begins to stand out! The mechanics and theme merge to perfection and art is wonderful!

A kickstarter game that I backed because I fell for the artwork and the relatively cheap price point. However, the game was just alright for me and gets frustrating and repetitive. Sold this as I much prefer to spend my time playing other games than this. This also helps a lot in curbing my kickstarter obsession, as I much rather get a game that is more properly tried and tested with tons of review after this experience.

I was attracted by the artwork at first-which is enthralling, but wasn't too sure about the gameplay. It is possibly best to be played with 3-4 players, I found playing with more tend to get the Temporal Clash very frequently. The concept is awesome, and they even have soundtrack and novel for it (Kickstarter stretch goals I assume). The overall gameplay is simple and fun, there is bluff and strategy involved.

RATING: 7
The card-counting aspect is interesting. Need to experiment more with intentionally taking other players Fragments, in order to slow the game a bit. Wild card mechanics feel a little off, but in larger groups this is a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The cards are pretty and it doesn't take too long to play.  That's the good part.

Game play consists of role selection (try not to conflict with others), set collection, take that and massive amounts of luck.  Offense is useless if your cards don't appear.  Defense is next to impossible since there are multiple ways to do the same thing.

I'm pretty sure there are 50 fillers I like better than this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The artwork alone is worth the cost. The card quality is beyond measure, absolutely the best cards I have ever handled; they are durable so you wouldn't need to sleeve them and deprive your senses of the cards' amazing finish. The game itself is snappy and quick, and sometimes I find myself overthinking my next move...you're playing the game and your opponent, after all.

RATING: 5.5
Gorgeous artwork is the greatest quality of this game. The theme is exciting and the Anchor token is beautiful and heavy. Even though Entropy is designed for up to 6 players, this game goes downhill quickly with more than 3. Because you're making simultaneous selections, it's very easy to clash with each other since there are only so many good options. Each time I've played with 5+ the game devolves into frustration as no-one can consistently accomplish their tasks due to everyone picking the same options. To attempt otherwise is to accept sub-par options. With three players, the game can be dynamic and quite enjoyable but I don't recommend any more than that.

Why this isn't a 10:
-> From the game rules: "Should two or more players select the same action, a temporal clash occurs and players involved in the clash do not get to resolve their action."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A simple filler type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Players play simultaneously, playing and revealing cards from their hand, and resolving actions in the order of card rank played.  Playing cards of same rank means you are blocked and get to do nothing (unless you have the Anchor token).  The actions draw, reveal and move cards around the table, with the object being the first to find your four special cards.

Not sure what this game is trying to be - possibly a bluffy filler, but it felt messy.  Not one I need to play again.

Ahhoz képest, hogy szinte absztakt játék, nagyon hangulatosra sikeredett. Ez a világdarabka összeszedés izgalmas, hátborzongató téma. A szerepválasztós mechanika se rossz, bár hatan el se tudom képzelni, hogy mikor sikerül egyáltalán akciózni, Négyesben még pont jó volt ilyen szempontból, de azért már nagyon sok volt az összeakadás.Viszont igen nagy benne a szerencse szerepe. Elég nagy a pakli, pechesebb esetben simán lehet, hogy nem is találkozol minden lapoddal a játékban. A játékidő rövidsége némileg megbocsájthatóvá teszi ezt, de azért jó lenne valami megnyugtatóbb megoldás rá a működésben.

Simultaneous hidden role selection can be a fun mechanic, but I find Entropy's implementation of it to be boring. The game has so much randomness from the luck of the draw that many actions often have limited utility (also meaning that being blocked from an action by playing the same role card is often not a huge setback). While the game has a brisk pace and the artwork is interesting (though sometimes to the extent of getting in the way of the ability of the cards to communicate what they represent), the uninspiring gameplay prevents me from recommending Entropy.

RATING: 6
A játék sok szempontból igazán jó. Tematikailag, mechanikailag remek, szépek a képek, a hangulat. A valóság töredékének keresése nagyon vonzó történeti alap. Mivel mindenkinek nagyjából ugyanazok az akciólehetőségei, és ezeket titkosan választjuk ki, bizony előfordul ütközés (azaz gyakorlatilag nem tudjuk végrehajtani azt, amit szeretnénk), ez az ilyen jellegű játékokban nem ritka. Ha valakit ez nagyon zavar, nem neki való az Entropy. Ha valaki túl tudja tenni magát ezen, igazán élvezetes játék lehet számára. Én valahol a kettő között vagyok, de mivel nagyon rövid a játékidő, sokkal elnézőbb tudok lenni. :)

Az viszont kimondottan hiba, hogy ráírták a kétfősséget. Meg lehet próbálni, de sok értelme nincs. Ahogyan a 6 fősségnek sem. Az előbbi esetben nagyon kevés esély van az ütközésre (ugyanaz az akció kijátszása), az utóbbi esetben meg... Hát összesen van 6 akciólehetőség, jó eséllyel akár 3-4-en is ugyanazt választják, és akkor lőttek annak a körnek. Végül is olyankor tényleg jól jöhet a felzárkoztató mechanizmus, ami a fordulók végén van, de azért ott is kell szerencse...

RATING: 7
This is a light, filler, simultaneous action selection game.  There's some bluffing and a fair amount of strategy, but also a lot of luck.  For a game that plays in 15 minutes though, I think the luck is perfectly acceptable.

You get some really interesting decisions and it really pays to think about what your opponents will be trying to do.

The thing that opitimizes this game: you're trying to guess what your opponents will do based on nothing other than some POE and, trying to guess how they will think about the situation.  Since it's impossible to KNOW how they will think about the situation (as everyone is trying to guess what other people will do and not do it), this can feel either like a) this is really neat, pscyhing each other out, trying to feel out the situation, or b) this is basically the same thing as randomness.  I think the truth is a combination of a and b, but some people aren't going to feel good about this game if it feels like b to them.

The Ronin Expansion also adds a character that interacts with the game in a totally different kind of way, also.

The game is significantly different for 2, 3, 4, and 5 players, because at each level there is a difference in how likely clashes are and the importance of the anchor.  I'm ok with this; in fact, it's a great thing to play a slightly different game for each player size.

The interesting choices of action and ways they interact with each other really makes this game great.  Several of the actions have two possible uses, so that gives you a little more to think about but not too much.  

Overall I think this game hits a sweet spot, for a game of this length, for having decisions but not too many decisions.  I don't see people getting caught up in AP in this game.

Also this has possibly the most beautiful artwork I've ever seen in a game, and amazingly high production quality.  I do mean amazing.

The big problem is, it gets very repetitive after a while.

Role selection, set collection, bluff, deduction and a bit of 'take that'.

Played a 2 player game of this at Cancon 2015.    Would play differently with more players.

Really liked the graphic design - great artwork on the cards, symbols which matched the colours to make everything easier to identify (important for those of use who have colour vision issues).  Big tick there.  

Enjoyed the gameplay for what it was - a light filler.  I expect that with more players it would have a different feel - and ganging up - much like the way love letter has a very different feel at 2 players than more.  I'd give it a solid 7 after one play, could go higher depending on how 3+ players works out.

I actually really liked this game.  It took a few turns to get going as there wasn't much anyone could do (everyone clashed almost all the time)

Tenser riff on a simultaneous selection card game. Tenser because victory condition is first past the post, and it played out that the round in which someone won was the round in which more than one person could have won (several rounds in). The wild cards, while beautiful, might be one or two too many, especially given that the vortex is also a wild (or so I'm told).

Really disappointing single-play, and unlikely to hit the table again. It's simultaneous reveal (hmm in itself) of actions, which allow you to gather cards in various ways, but where you can only win if the cards you're required to gather actually emerge from the deck. I never had a chance to win. Unforgivable, even in a supposed filler. I'm not sure how or why this could be considered an attractive proposition in this day and age.

I really like the catch up mechanism when players clash frequently. It prevents the game from stalling and even makes it advantageous to clash at times. 

Update: after playing it a couple times at a larger player count I discovered 1) it scales very poorly and 2) the catchup mechanism does nothing to save you if you clash, and once you clash you're statistically at a much greater chance to clash again.

Kickstarter edition with metal Anchor coin.

Decent filler with attractive art. This is a mostly random card game with a little bit of deduction. The more people you add the more random it feels, though as you end up clashing on action selection more and more. I don't mind, since it's quick and simple, but that aspect didn't appeal to everyone in my group.

For a game of similar weight and length, I would probably rather play Red 7.

RATING: 7.4
An interesting twist on the Race for the Galaxy/San Juan method of simultaneous action selection, possibly more interesting in this employment. Selecting the same as your opponent can be harmful or beneficial, a tactical move or a blundering accident. 

The artwork is beautiful, the gameplay quick and fun, although a bit too much luck in the draws (a player whose fragments stay towards the bottom of the deck is very unlikely to win). Ok with two but much more fun with three or four players. Good player interaction, as the game mostly revolves around anticipating player selections and whether to gamble or play it safe.

[KS] Backed this on KS. I like the concept and the artwork is great, but it's rather lacking as a game. It seems to be basically 'select an action and hope nobody else picks the same one or you're screwed.' So much so, in fact, that every 4th turn is a catch-up mechanism for those who got too screwed. There seems to be some slight strategy here, but as far as I can tell it consists mostly of tit-for-tat actions and wasting your own to try and block someone else from winning, followed by frequent reshuffling of the deck. It doesn't play well with 5 people - 3 is probably the sweet spot for this one. Regrettably not a keeper for me.

Just doesn't seem to be balanced although you can house rule it to have an extra face up card. The game itself is stunning but I like Ninja Dojo if I am looking for something similar to play. Ninja Dojo seems cleaner and easier to play although it isn't as much game as Entropy.

This turned out to be a lot better game than the first few plays indicated.  Once you become familiar with your action cards you can use them more effectively, use more strategies such as blocking the actions of other players, and just have more fun.

Finally had a chance to play my KS copy. Entropy has a lot to like, and it was well-received by my friends:

TL;DR
+ Cool theme and good artwork
+ Production copy is great quality and the PnP is easy
+ Quick, fun and easy to learn
- Card game randomness
- Limited options/control

Entropy's theme is similar to MTG's Shards of Alara and Planar Chaos, where different realities and time periods collide. Gameplay reflects the theme, with players trying to pick out reality cards from a random deck. Conflict is sometimes direct, but players often collide haphazardly in the process of reassembling their reality. The card art for the character and reality cards is also cool and creative.

The production copy I received from Kickstarter was great quality -- cards were printed on a textured linen cardstock and the box included a thematically designed metal coin. Print and Play PDF is also relatively easy, since the game is mainly a deck of cards and a token for the anchor. (I ordered an extra deck using printerstudio.com.)

Entropy usually plays quickly, since players make decisions simultaneously, the deck is relatively small and four matched cards win. The first group I played it with learned it and easily played two or three games in an hour. The game is balanced and well-paced, but limits player choices. For example, several of the characters have only one card each round for drawing (Eye of the Storm), and this card can easily be cancelled (often unintentionally) by other players. As with many card games, one player might see either all or none of the cards he or she needs (although Entropy's deck is shuffled several times during each game).
